It is characterized by \"horseplay\", slapstick or farce. Examples include the throwing of a custard pie into someone's face. The definition has expanded to include obvious physical jokes, such as the wedgie.\nThe term \"low comedy\" was coined by John Dryden in his preface to his play \"An Evening's Love\".\nHistory.\nThis type of comedy has been a fixture ever since Greek plays. For instance Sophocles once wrote a satyr play, no longer extant, about satyrs who seek to persuade a king that they are worthy suitors of his daughter by bragging about their capacity for flatulence. Aristophanes claimed that he hoped his plays would not be too highbrow for the common people to understand though he acknowledged that his work presupposed a level of intelligence that was not normally assumed. Even the word 'comedy' is derived from a Greek phrase meaning either Song of Revelry or Song of The Village, the latter of which implies that it is meant for everyone including the lowest common denominator.\nLow comedy was first denoted as comedy for the commoners because it was most often practiced by street performers. Over time, as low comedy began to include lewd jokes and more physical comedy, more mainstream performers began to practice this type of comedy: stand-up comedians, musicals, etc. This type of comedy also was employed in most cartoons. For instance, in \"Porky's Duck Hunt\", Porky Pig is routinely subjected to physical slapstick. A 1945 Bugs Bunny cartoon which parodied and lampooned Hermann Goering included a scene wherein Bugs successfully tore off G\u00f6ring's medals one by one and G\u00f6ring's trousers fell off. Likewise Daffy Duck is routinely shot by Elmer Fudd in \"wabbit season\" cartoons.\nSocial context.\nLow comedy in society is quite well known; it can be found in a wide range of media, such as television and theatre. It can also be found in , such as clowns, mimes and comedians. The term \"low\" is represented in association to low culture. This form of comedy is targeted and understood towards people who attain nonacademic high school education, meaning this form of comedy is not restricted to high levels of education and knowledge. Low comedy is well known and popular today because it is considered suitable for all individuals. This form of comedy connects to popular culture by its easy to understand style.\nLow comedy, however, has lacked appreciation from most of society and is looked down upon in contrast to high comedy. The sole purpose of low comedy is to evoke laughter in people. Because there is no contextual message in most forms of low comedy, it is not highly respected. This does not undermine the fact that it is still an effective form of comedy for its reputation to cause laughter.\nThe classification of things considered to be low comedy constantly changes over time. As society changes, so do the ideas about what high and low comedy is. For example, due to the overdoing of sitcoms in the past, it is now considered shrill, vulgar, low society where everyone talk-screeches in some sub-human, mock-sophisticated language of incessant insult. Some sitcoms are somewhere in between low and high comedy. For instance the animated series \"The Simpsons\" routinely includes slapstick violence, yet has also satirized political issues and parodied classic films and literature.\nToday, low comedy can be seen in almost any production. Sitcoms often base most of the plot on this type of comedy because of society influencing productivity and considering it a low form of comedy. Modern adaptations of Shakespeare's plays also use low comedy to convey a different understanding of the play. \"As You Like It\" for example is the story of a woman named Rosalyn who meets her male love interest while disguised as a man and inadvertently arouses the affection of a woman named Phoebe who repeatedly rejects her male suitor because she is in love with the man that Rosalyn is pretending to be.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is in the province of Munster and is part of the Southern Region. It is named after the city of Waterford. Waterford City and County Council is the local authority for the county. The population of the county at large, including the city, was 127,363 according to the 2022 census. The county is based on the historic Gaelic territory of the \"D\u00e9ise\". There is an Irish-speaking area, Gaeltacht na nD\u00e9ise, in the southwest of the county.\nGeography and subdivisions.\nCounty Waterford has two mountain ranges, the Knockmealdown Mountains and the Comeragh Mountains. The highest point in the county is Knockmealdown, at . It also has many rivers, including Ireland's third-longest river, the River Suir (); and Ireland's fourth-longest river, the Munster Blackwater (). There are over 30 beaches along Waterford's volcanic coastline. A large stretch of this coastline, known as the Copper Coast, has been designated as a UNESCO Geopark, a place of great geological importance. To the west of Dungarvan is the D\u00e9ise Gaeltacht, an Irish-speaking region comprising the areas of Ring, County Waterford and Old Parish.\nWaterford is the county seat; prior to the merger of the 2 Waterford authorities in June 2014 Dungarvan was the county seat for Waterford County Council.\nBaronies.\nThere are eight historic baronies in the county: Coshmore and Coshbride, Decies-within-Drum, Decies-without-Drum, Gaultiere, Glenahiry, Middlethird, Upperthird and Waterford City.\nLargest towns.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Module:Historical populations/styles.css\"/&gt;\nHistory.\nCounty Waterford is colloquially known as \"The D\u00e9ise\", pronounced \"day-shah\" or, in Irish, /d\u02b2e:\u0283\u02b2\u026a/ (). Some time between the 4th and 8th centuries, an Irish tribe called the D\u00e9isi were driven from southern county Meath/north Kildare and moved into the Waterford region, conquering and settling there. The ancient principality of the D\u00e9ise is today roughly coterminous with the current Roman Catholic Diocese of Waterford and Lismore thus including part of south County Tipperary.\nThe westernmost of the baronies are Decies-within-Drum and Decies-without-Drum, separated by the Drum-Fineen hills.\nThere are many megalithic tombs and ogham stones in the county. The Viking influence can still be seen with Reginald's Tower, one of the first buildings to use a brick and mortar construction method in Ireland. Woodstown, a settlement dating to the 9th century, was discovered west of Waterford city. It was the largest settlement outside Scandinavia and the only large-scale 9th-century Viking settlement discovered to date in Western Europe. Other architectural features are products of the Anglo-Norman invasion of Ireland and its effects.\nLocal government and politics.\nAs of 1 June 2014, Waterford City and County Council is the local government authority for the local government area of Waterford City and County. The authority was formed following the merger of the local government areas of the county of Waterford and the city of Waterford under the Local Government Reform Act 2014, and succeeded the functions of Waterford City Council and Waterford County Council. The local authority is responsible for certain local services such as sanitation, planning and real-estate development, libraries, the collection of automobile taxation, local roads and social housing.\nFor elections to D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann, the county is represented by the 4-seat constituency of Waterford. For European elections, the city and county are part of the 5-seat South constituency.\nGaeltacht.\n is a Gaeltacht area in County Waterford, consisting of the parish of and . is located from the town of Dungarvan, has a population of 1,816 people (Census 2016) and encompasses a geographical area of 62\u00a0km2. According to Census 2016 the percentage of daily Irish speakers in was 45.6%.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "74193", "revid": "28903366", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=74193", "title": "Picinae", "text": "Subfamily of birds\nPicinae containing the true woodpeckers is one of four subfamilies that make up the woodpecker family Picidae. True woodpeckers are found over much of the world, but do not occur in Madagascar or Australasia.\nWoodpeckers gained their English name because of the habit of some species of tapping and pecking noisily on tree trunks with their beaks and heads. This is both a means of communication to signal possession of territory to their rivals, and a method of locating and accessing insect larvae found under the bark or in long winding tunnels in the tree or upright log.\nPhysiology and behaviour.\nSome woodpeckers and wrynecks in the order Piciformes have zygodactyl feet, with two toes pointing forward, and two backward. These feet, though adapted for clinging to a vertical surface, can be used for grasping or perching. Several species have only three toes. The woodpecker's long tongue, in many cases as long as the woodpecker itself, can be darted forward to capture insects. The tongue is not attached to the woodpecker's head in the same way as it is in most birds, but instead it curls back up around its skull, which allows it to be so long.\nThe woodpecker first locates a tunnel by tapping on the trunk with its head. Once a tunnel is found, the woodpecker chisels out wood until it makes an opening into the tunnel. Then it worms its tongue into the tunnel to try to locate the grub. The tongue of the woodpecker is long and ends in a barb. With its tongue the woodpecker skewers the grub and draws it out of the trunk.\nWoodpeckers also use their beaks to create larger holes for their nests which are 15\u201345\u00a0cm (6\u201318\u00a0inches) below the opening. These nests are lined only with wood chips and hold 2\u20138 white eggs. Because the nests are out of sight, they are not visible to predators and eggs do not need to be camouflaged. Cavities created by woodpeckers are also reused as nests by other birds, such as grackles, starlings, some ducks and owls, and mammals, such as tree squirrels.\nSeveral adaptations combine to protect the woodpecker's brain from the substantial pounding that the pecking behaviour causes: it has a relatively thick skull with relatively spongy bone to cushion the brain; there is very little cerebrospinal fluid in its small subarachnoid space; the bird contracts mandibular muscles just before impact, thus transmitting the impact past the brain and allowing its whole body to help absorb the shock; its relatively small brain is less prone to concussion than other animals'.\nSome species have modified joints between bones in the skull and upper jaw, as well as muscles which contract to absorb the shock of the hammering. Strong neck and tail-feather muscles, and a chisel-like bill are other hammering adaptations which are seen in most species. Other species of woodpecker, such as the Flicker, uses its long tongue primarily to grab prey from the ground or from under loose bark. It has few shock-absorbing adaptations, and prefers to feed on the ground or to chip away at rotting wood and bark, habits observed in birds outside of the woodpecker family. A \"continuum\" in skull structures, from little- to highly specialized for pounding is seen in different genera (groups of related species) of woodpeckers alive today. In his classic \"Birds of America,\" John James Audubon describes the slight gradations in hyoid horn length found in different species of living woodpeckers. The slack of tongue is kept under the loose skin behind its neck. The tiny bones divide into essentially two tongues, coming back together before entering the beak.\nSystematics.\nThe systematics of woodpeckers is quite convoluted. Based on an assumption of unrealistically low convergence in details of plumage and behavior, 5 subfamilies were distinguished. However, it has turned out that similar plumage patterns and modes of life are not reliable to determine higher phylogenetic relationships in woodpeckers, and thus only 3 subfamilies should be accepted.\nFor example, the genera \"Dryocopus\" (Eurasia and Americas) and \"Campephilus\" (Americas) of large woodpeckers were believed to form a distinct group. However, they are quite unrelated and instead close, respectively, to the genera, \"Mulleripicus\" and \"Chrysocolaptes\", of Southeast Asia. In addition, the genus allocation of many species, e.g. the rufous woodpecker, has turned out to be in error, and some taxa with unclear relationships could be placed into the phylogeny.\nIn 1975 John Morony and colleagues in their \"Reference List of the Birds of the World\" divided the true woodpeckers into six tribes: Melanerpini, Campetherini, Colaptini, Campephilini, Picini, Meiglyptini. This classification was used in 1982 by Lesley Short in his \"Woodpeckers of the World\". The introduction of molecular methods led to a substantial reorganization of the phylogeny making the earlier groups obsolete. In 2005 David Webb and William Moore divided the main woodpecker genera into three tribes: Megapicini, Malarpicini and Dendropicini. These names were rapidly accepted by other ornithologists but in 2013 Edward Dickinson and Leslie Christidis in the fourth edition of the \"Howard and Moore Complete Checklist of the Birds of the World\" rejected these new names on the grounds that the earlier names had precedence. Webb and Moore's Malarpicini, Megapicini and Dendropicini were replaced by Pici, Campephilini and Melanerpini. Dickinson and Christidis also introduced Nesoctitini for the Antillean piculets and Hemicircini for the two species in Hemicircus giving a total of five tribes.\nGenera.\nThe world bird list maintained by Frank Gill, Pamela Rasmussen and David Donsker on behalf of the International Ornithologists' Union recognises 208 species of true woodpecker which are split up into 33 genera. The division into tribes is based on the 2017 study by Sabir Shakya and colleagues.\nTribe Nesoctitini\nTribe Hemicircini\nTribe Picini\nTribe Campephilini\nTribe Melanerpini (pied woodpeckers)\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "74195", "revid": "43668672", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=74195", "title": "Sitar", "text": "Indian plucked stringed instrument\nThe sitar ( or ; IAST: ) is a plucked stringed instrument, originating from the Indian subcontinent, used in Hindustani classical music. The instrument was invented in the 18th century, and arrived at its present form in 19th-century India. Khusrau Khan, an 18th-century figure of the Mughal Empire, has been identified by modern scholarship as the inventor of the sitar. According to most historians, he developed the sitar from the setar, an Iranian instrument of Abbasid or Safavid origin.\nUsed widely throughout the Indian subcontinent, the sitar became popularly known in the wider world through the works of Ravi Shankar, beginning in the late 1950s and early 1960s. The advent of psychedelic culture during the mid-to-late 1960s set a trend for the use of the sitar in Western popular music, with the instrument appearing on tracks by bands such as the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, Metallica and many others.\nEtymology.\nThe word \"sitar\" is derived from the Persian word , meaning 'three-stringed'. \nAccording to Curt Sachs, Persians chose to name their lutes around the word \"tar\", meaning string, combined with a word for the number of strings. \nBy example: \nHistory.\nIt was theorized that the sitar was invented, or rather developed by Amir Khusrow (c.\u00a01253\u20131325), a famous Sufi inventor, poet and pioneer of Khyal, Tarana and Qawwali, during the 13th century. However, the tradition of Amir Khusrow is considered discredited by scholars. Whatever instruments he might have played, no record exists from this period using the name \"sitar\". An ambiguous statement made in a 19th century work by Captain N. Augustus Willard may have resulted in the incorrect association of the renowned poet Amir Khusrau with a later individual, potentially named Khusrau Khan, who lived during the 18th century.\nThe earliest mention of Sitar dates back to 1739 AD. The \"Muraqqa-i-Dehli\", written by Dargah Quli Khan during the reign of Muhammad Shah Rangila, gives the earliest reference to the sitar. Oral and textual evidence analysed by historians indicate that an eighteenth-century figure of the Mughal court, named Khusrau Khan originated the sitar from the small persian three-stringed setar. In the late Mughal Empire, the instrument began to take on its modern shape. The neck got wider. The bowl, which had been made of glued lathes of wood was now made of gourd, with metal frets and a bone nut on the neck. Masid Khan added two more strings to the sitar. The modern seven string sitar was created by Allauddin Khan. Sympathetic strings on sitar were first added by Imdad Khan. The earliest compositional style specifically for the sitar emerged in the mid-eighteenth century, attributed to Firoz Khan, who was either the son or nephew of Khusrau Khan.\nAnother, discredited hypothesis is that the sitar is derived from locally developed Indian instruments, such as the veena, prior to the arrival of Islam. Proponents of this hypothesis claim that Indian temple sculptures from the 9th and 10th centuries feature sitar-like instruments. However, according to author Samidha Vedabala, a researcher and professor of music at Sikkim University, none of the instruments depicted in these sculptures precisely resemble the sitar, and neither the word \"sitar\" nor any local equivalent appears in any texts referring to these instruments. So its authenticity is in the absolute dark. According to Allyn Miner, the evidence for this hypothesis is too weak for any conclusion and these hypotheses represent a prominent yet obsolete late 19th-century idea: that many of India's modern cultural innovations are actually products of pre-Muslim Sanskritic traditions. According to Alastair Dick, the \"modern view that\u00a0... invading Muslims simply changed into Persian the name of an existing Hindu instrument\u00a0... has no historical or musical foundation\". Other scholars have contested the veena origin hypotheses of the sitar by pointing out that proponents of these hypotheses select the number of strings as the primary criterion in coming to their conclusions. Additionally, they attempt to trace the sitar back to a known Indian musical instrument with a Sanskrit name, while acknowledging that there is no evidence for the existence of long-necked lutes in the Indian subcontinent prior to the era of Muslim expansion into the region.\nPhysical description.\nA sitar can have 18, 19, 20, or 21 strings; 6 or 7 of these run over curved, raised frets and are played strings; the remainder are sympathetic strings (\"tarb\", also known as \"taarif\" or \"tarafdaar\"), running underneath the frets and resonating in sympathy with the played strings. The frets, which are known as or thaat, are movable, allowing fine tuning. The played strings run to tuning pegs on or near the head of the instrument, while the sympathetic strings, which have a variety of different lengths, pass through small holes in the fretboard to engage with the smaller tuning pegs that run down the instrument's neck.\nThe instrument has two bridges: the large bridge (\"badaa goraa\") for the playing and drone strings and the small bridge (\"chota goraa\") for the sympathetic strings. Its timbre results from the way the strings interact with the wide, rounded bridge. As a string vibrates, its length changes slightly as one edge moves along the rounded bridge, promoting the creation of overtones and giving the sound its distinctive tone. The maintenance of this specific tone by shaping the bridge is called \"jawari\". Many musicians rely on instrument makers to adjust this.\nMaterials used in construction include teak wood or \"tun\" wood (\"Cedrela toona\"), which is a variation of mahogany, for the neck and faceplate (\"tabli\"), and calabash gourds for the resonating chambers. The instrument's bridges are made of deer horn, ebony, or very occasionally from camel bone. Synthetic material is now common as well.\nConstruction styles.\nThere are two popular modern styles of sitar: the fully decorated \"instrumental style\" (sometimes called the \"Ravi Shankar style\") and the \"gayaki\" style (sometimes called the \"Vilayat Khan\" style).\nThe instrumental style sitar is most often made of seasoned toon wood, but sometimes made of teak. It is often fitted with a second resonator, a small tumba (pumpkin or pumpkin-like wood replica) on the neck. This style is usually fully decorated, with floral or grape carvings and celluloid inlays with colored (often brown or red) and black floral or arabesque patterns. It typically has 13 sympathetic strings. It is said that the best Teak sitars are made from teak that has been seasoned for generations. The sources of very old seasoned wood are guarded trade secrets. Therefore, instrument builders look for old teak that was used in old colonial-style villas as whole trunk columns for their special sitar constructions.\nThere are various additional sub-styles and cross mixes of styles in sitars, according to customer preferences. Most importantly, there are some differences in preferences for the positioning of sympathetic (\"taraf\") string pegs (see photo).\nAmong all sitar styles, there are student styles, beginner models, semi-pro styles, pro models, master models, and so on. Prices are often determined by the manufacturer's name and not by looks alone or materials used. Some sitars by certain manufacturers fetch very high collectible prices. Most notable are older Rikhi Ram (Delhi) and older Hiren Roy (Kolkata) sitars, depending upon which master built the instrument. Nikhil Banerjee had a small extra bridge fixed at the top of the sitar fingerboard for sustain.\nTuning of sitar.\nTuning depends on the sitarist's school or style, tradition and each artist's personal preference. The main playing string is almost invariably tuned a perfect fourth \"above\" the tonic, the second string being tuned to the tonic. The tonic in the Indian solf\u00e8ge system is referred to as \"\u1e63a\u1e0dja\", \"\u1e63a\u1e0daj\", or the shortened form \"sa\", or \"kha\u1e5baj\", a dialectal variant of \"\u1e63a\u1e0daj\", not as \"v\u0101d\", and the perfect fifth to which one or more of the drones strings are tuned is referred to as \"pa\u00f1cam\", not \"samv\u0101d\".\nThe player should re-tune for each raga. Strings are tuned by tuning pegs, and the main playing strings can be fine-tuned by sliding a bead threaded on each string just below the bridge.\nIn one or more of the more common tunings (used by Ravi Shankar, among others, called \"Kharaj Pancham\" sitar) the playable strings are strung in this fashion:\nThere is a lot of stylistic variance within these tunings, and like most Indian stringed instruments, there is no default tuning. Mostly, tunings vary by schools of teaching (gharana) and the piece that is meant to be played.\nPlaying.\nThe instrument is balanced between the player's left foot and right knee. The hands move freely without having to carry any of the instrument's weight. The player plucks the string using a metallic pick or plectrum called a mizraab. The thumb stays anchored on the top of the fretboard just above the main gourd. Generally, only the index and middle fingers are used for fingering although a few players occasionally use the third. A specialized technique called \"meend\" involves pulling the main melody string down over the bottom portion of the sitar's curved frets, with which the sitarist can achieve a seven-semitone range of notes. This was developed by Vilayat Khan into a technique that imitated the melisma of the vocal style, a technique known as \"gayaki ang\". Sometimes, a sitar could be played with a bow. Its sound is similar to sarangi, but raspier.\nAdept players bring in charisma through the use of special techniques like Kan, Krintan, Murki, Zamzama, etc. They also use special Mizrab Bol-s, as in Misrabani.\nWorld music influence.\nIn the late 1950s and early 1960s Ravi Shankar, along with his tabla player, Alla Rakha, began a further introduction of Indian classical music to western culture.\nThe sitar saw use in western music when, guided by David Crosby's championing of Shankar,&lt;ref name=\"Gallo/Billboard\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; George Harrison played it on the Beatles' songs \"Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown)\", \"Love You To\" and \"Within You Without You\", recorded between 1965 and 1967. The Beatles' association with the instrument helped popularise Indian classical music among Western youth, particularly once Harrison began receiving tutelage from Shankar and the latter's prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Shambhu Das in 1966. That same year, Brian Jones of the Rolling Stones used a sitar on \"Paint It Black\", while another English guitarist, Dave Mason, played it on Traffic's 1967 hits \"Paper Sun\" and \"Hole in My Shoe\". These and other examples marked a trend of featuring the instrument in pop songs, which Shankar later described as \"the great sitar explosion\". Speaking to \"KRLA Beat\" in July 1967, he said: \"Many people, especially young people, have started listening to sitar since George Harrison, one of the Beatles, became my disciple\u00a0... It is now the 'in' thing.\"\nLed Zeppelin's Jimmy Page talked about his love of Indian music, saying: \"I went to India after I came back from a tour with the Yardbirds in the late sixties just so I could hear the music firsthand. Let's put it this way: I had a sitar before George Harrison got his. I wouldn't say I played it as well as he did, though...\" Robbie Krieger's guitar part on the Doors' 1967 track \"The End\" was heavily influenced by Indian ragas and features melodic and rhythmic qualities that suggest a sitar or veena. Many pop performances actually involve the electric sitar, which is a solid-body, guitar-like instrument and quite different from the traditional acoustic Indian instrument.\nThe Kinks' 1965 single \"See My Friends\" featured a \"low-tuned drone guitar\" that was widely mistaken to be a sitar. Crosby's band, the Byrds, had similarly incorporated elements of Indian music, using \"only Western instrumentation\", on their songs \"Eight Miles High\" and \"Why\" in 1966. Psychedelic music bands often used new recording techniques and effects and drew on non-Western sources such as the ragas and drones of Indian music. The Electric Prunes appeared in early ads for the Vox Wah wah pedal, which touted the effect's ability to make an electric guitar sound like a sitar.\nDonovan's personnel on his 1966 album \"Sunshine Superman\" included Shawn Phillips on sitar. Phillips also played sitar on one song on Donovan's next album \"Mellow Yellow\", produced in 1967.\nStarting in the late 1970s, Pakistan International Airlines in-flight music featured the sitar to evoke feelings of nostalgia for the homeland among the Pakistani diaspora.\nSteve Howe of the British progressive rock band Yes played a Danelectro sitar guitar on their album \"Close to the Edge\" as well as the song \"To Be Over\" from their 1974 album \"Relayer\". Deepak Khazanchi played sitar and tanpura on the song \"It Can Happen\", from Yes' 1983 album \"90125\".\nPaul Young's 1985 cover of Hall &amp; Oates's song \"Everytime You Go Away\" included an electric sitar played by John Turnbull.\nSitar gharanas.\nA gharana is a system of social organisation in the Indian subcontinent, linking musicians or dancers by lineage or apprenticeship.

He was a Byzantine noble and senior official in Constantinople when the dying Constantine VIII forced him to divorce his wife and marry the emperor's daughter, Zo\u00eb. Upon Constantine's death three days later, Romanos took the throne.\nRomanos has been recorded as a well-meaning but ineffective emperor. He disorganised the tax system and undermined the military, personally leading a disastrous military expedition against Aleppo. He fell out with his wife and foiled several attempts on his throne, including two which revolved around his sister-in-law Theodora. He spent large amounts on the construction and repair of churches and monasteries. He died after six years on the throne, allegedly murdered, and was succeeded by his wife's young lover, Michael IV.\nLife.\nFamily and early career.\nRomanos Argyros, born in 968, was the son of Marianos, a member of the Argyros family. Other hypotheses about his father are Pothos Argyros who defeated a Magyar raid in 958 (identified by some scholars with an older namesake), or Eustathios Argyros, known only for commissioning a poem in honour of Romanos II in 950. Romanos' father, Marianos, was the son of another Romanos Argyros, who had married Agatha, a daughter of Emperor Romanos I Lekapenos (r. 919\u2013944).\nRomanos had several siblings: Basil Argyros, who served as general and governor under Basil II (r. 976\u20131025); Leo, who served under Basil and was killed in Italy in 1017; Pulcheria Argyropoulina, who married the \"magistros\" Basil Skleros; a sister who married Constantine Karantenos, who served as \"doux\" of Antioch under Romanos; and Maria Argyropoulina, who married Giovanni Orseolo, son of Doge Pietro II Orseolo.\nHe served as \"krites\" (judge) in Opsikion, with the rank of \"protospatharios\" (one of the highest judicial ranks, usually awarded to senior generals and provincial governors). In this capacity he persecuted heretics at Akmoneia. He was then promoted to the post of \"quaestor\" (the senior judicial official for the imperial capital, Constantinople) and became one of the judges of the Hippodrome, the High Court of the Empire. In this role he is mentioned in the \"Peira\", a compendium of legal decisions compiled by the noted jurist Eustathios Rhomaios. He was promoted further to the rank of \"patrikios\" and the post of \"oikonomos\" (administrator) of the Great Church, while continuing to preside over the High Court. Under Emperor Constantine VIII he held the post of urban prefect of Constantinople, which made him the formal head of the Senate and one of the emperor's chief lieutenants.\nReign.\nLate in 1028, Constantine VIII lay on his deathbed. Wishing to secure the Macedonian dynasty, but having no son, he summoned Constantine Dalassenos from Antioch to marry his oldest daughter, Zo\u00eb. Dalassenos, the \"doux\" of Antioch, was an experienced military commander, influential patrician, and unswervingly loyal to the ruling house. The emperor's advisors preferred not to have a strong military figure as the new emperor, and persuaded the Emperor to choose Romanos instead, as a potentially more pliable and certainly less travelled candidate. Constantine VIII forced Romanos to divorce his wife Helena, who was sent to a monastery, and to marry Zo\u00eb, aged 50 at the time; Romanos was 60. The marriage took place on 9 November 1028, and on the same ceremony Romanos was proclaimed \"caesar\". Three days later, on 11 November, Constantine died of illness.\nThe new emperor was eager to make his mark as a ruler, but was mostly ineffectual in his enterprises. He idealised Marcus Aurelius, aspiring to be a new philosopher king, and similarly sought to imitate the military prowess of Trajan. He spent large sums on new buildings and in endowing churches and monasteries. He endeavoured to relieve the pressure of taxation on the aristocracy, which undermined the finances of the state. Previous emperors had attempted to control the privileges of the nobles over the common people. Coming from the aristocracy himself, Romanos III abandoned this policy. This failure to stand up to the aristocrats allowed them to exploit the rural mass of landed peasantry, who increasingly fell into a condition of serfdom. This in turn undermined the traditional recruiting base of the Byzantine army. The combination of a reduced tax base and fewer native-born troops had long-term consequences. As revenue declined, the subsequent impoverishment of the state weakened the military's recruitment power still further.\nIn 1030 he resolved to lead an army in person against the Mirdasids of Aleppo, despite their having accepted the Byzantines as overlords, with disastrous results. The army camped at a waterless site and its scouts were ambushed. An attack by the Byzantine cavalry was defeated. That night Romanos held an imperial council at which the demoralised Byzantines resolved to abandon the campaign and return to Byzantine territory. Romanos also ordered his siege engines to be burned. On 10August 1030 the army departed its camp and made for Antioch. Discipline broke down in the Byzantine army, with Armenian mercenaries using the withdrawal as an opportunity to pillage the camp's stores. The Emir of Aleppo launched an attack and the imperial army broke and fled. Only the imperial bodyguard, the \"Hetaireia\", held firm, but Romanos was nearly captured. Accounts vary on the battle losses: John Skylitzes wrote that the Byzantines suffered a \"terrible rout\" and that some troops were killed in a chaotic stampede by their fellow soldiers, Yahya of Antioch wrote that the Byzantines suffered remarkably few casualties. According to Yahya, two high ranking Byzantine officers were among the fatalities, and another officer was captured by the Arabs. After this defeat the army became a \"laughing-stock\".\nDespite his victory, the Emir of Aleppo opened negotiations and signed a treaty that made Aleppo an Imperial tributary and allowed for a Greek governor to preside over the city. In 1032 the capture and successful defence of Edessa by George Maniakes and the sound defeat of a Saracen fleet in the Adriatic did little to restore Romanos' early popularity.\nRomanos faced several conspiracies, mostly centred on his sister-in-law Theodora. In 1029 she planned to marry the Bulgarian prince Presian and to usurp the throne. The plot was discovered, Presian was blinded and tonsured as a monk but Theodora was not punished. In 1031 she was implicated in another conspiracy, this time with Constantine Diogenes, the Archon of Sirmium, and was forcibly confined in the monastery of Petrion.\nIn a vain attempt to reduce expenditure, Romanos limited his wife's expenses, which merely exacerbated the alienation between the two. Romanos took a mistress. Zo\u00eb in turn fell in love with Michael, the brother of high-ranking court eunuch John the Orphanotrophos. Romanos, unaware, allowed Michael to become one of his personal servants. Having survived the attempts on his throne by Theodora, his death on 11 April 1034 was supposed to have been due to poison administered by his wife. There is also speculation that he was drowned in a bath on his wife's orders. He was buried in the Church of St. Mary Peribleptos, which he built.\nZo\u00eb and Michael were married on the same day that Romanos III died. The next day the couple summoned the Patriarch Alexios I to officiate in the coronation of the new emperor. Although he initially refused to co-operate, the payment of 50 pounds of gold helped change his mind. He proceeded to crown Michael IV as the new emperor of the Romans.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Until the ninth century it consisted of several independent major Gaelic kingdoms (U\u00ed Fiachrach, U\u00ed Bri\u00fain, U\u00ed Maine, Conmha\u00edcne, and Delbhna).\nBetween the reigns of Conchobar mac Taidg M\u00f3r (died 882) and his descendant, Aedh mac Ruaidri \u00d3 Conchobair (reigned 1228\u201333), it became a kingdom under the rule of the U\u00ed Bri\u00fain A\u00ed dynasty, whose ruling sept adopted the surname Ua Conchobair. At its greatest extent, it incorporated the often independent Kingdom of Breifne, as well as vassalage from the lordships of western Mide and west Leinster. Two of its greatest kings, Tairrdelbach Ua Conchobair (1088\u20131156) and his son Ruaidri Ua Conchobair (c. 1115\u20131198) greatly expanded the kingdom's dominance, so much so that both became High King of Ireland.\nThe Kingdom of Connacht collapsed in the 1230s because of civil war within the royal dynasty, which enabled widespread Hiberno-Norman settlement under Richard M\u00f3r de Burgh, 1st Baron of Connaught, and his successors. The Norman colony in Connacht shrank from c. 1300 to c. 1360, with events such as the 1307 battle of Ahascragh (see Donnchad Muimnech \u00d3 Cellaigh), the 1316 Second Battle of Athenry and the murder in June 1333 of William Donn de Burgh, 3rd Earl of Ulster, all leading to Gaelic resurgence and colonial withdrawal to towns such as Ballinrobe, Loughrea, Athenry, and Galway. Well into the 16th century, kingdoms such as U\u00ed Maine and T\u00edr Fh\u00edacrach M\u00faaidhe remained beyond English control, while many Norman families such as de Burgh, de Bermingham, de Exeter, de Staunton, became entirely Gaelicised. Only in the late 1500s, during the Tudor conquest of Ireland, was Connacht shired into its present counties.\nConnacht's population was 1,418,859 in 1841. Then came the Great Famine of the 1840s, which began a 120-year decline to under 400,000. The province has a population of just under 590,000 according to the preliminary results of the 2022 census.\nAnglicisation was less prominent in the west of Ireland, and Connacht today has the highest number of Irish language speakers among the four Irish provinces. Currently, the total percentage of people who consider themselves as Irish speakers in Connacht is 39.8% (more than 202,000 persons). There are Gaeltacht areas in Counties Galway and Mayo.\nThe province of Connacht has no official function for local government purposes, but it is an officially recognised subdivision of the Irish state. It is listed on ISO-3166-2 as one of the four provinces of Ireland and \"IE-C\" is attributed to Connacht as its country sub-division code. Along with counties from other provinces, Connacht lies in the Midlands\u2013North-West constituency for elections to the European Parliament.\nName.\nThe name comes from the medieval ruling dynasty, the \"Connacht\", later Connachta, whose name means \"descendants of Conn\", from the mythical king Conn of the Hundred Battles. The name of the province in the Irish language is \"Connachta\". Originally \"Connacht\" was a singular collective noun, but it came to be used only in the plural \"Connachta\", partly by analogy with plural names of other dynastic territories like Ulaid and Laigin, and partly because the Connachta split into different branches. Before the Connachta dynasty, the province (\"c\u00faige\", \"fifth\") was known as C\u00f3iced Ol nEchmacht. In Modern Irish, the province is usually called \"C\u00faige Chonnacht\", \"the Province of Connacht\", where \"Chonnacht\" is plural genitive case with lenition of the \"C\" to \"Ch\".\nThe usual English spelling in Ireland since the Gaelic revival is \"Connacht\", the spelling of the disused Irish singular. The official English spelling during English and British rule was the anglicisation \"Connaught\", pronounced or . This was used for the Connaught Rangers, an Irish regiment in the British Army; in the title of Queen Victoria's son Arthur, Duke of Connaught; and the Connaught Hotel, London, named after the Duke in 1917. Usage of the Connaught spelling is now in decline and is not a recognised version.\nState bodies use \"Connacht\", for example in Central Statistics Office census reports since 1926, and the name of the Connacht\u2013Ulster European Parliament constituency of 1979\u20132004, although \"Connaught\" occurs in some statutes. Among newspapers, the \"Connaught Telegraph\" (founded 1830) retains the anglicised spelling in its name, whereas the \"Connacht Tribune\" (founded 1909) uses the Gaelic. Connacht Rugby who represent the region and are based in Galway, use the Gaelic spelling also.\nGeography and political divisions.\nThe province is divided into five traditional counties, the fewest of any province. These are: Galway, Leitrim, Mayo, Roscommon and Sligo. Connacht is the smallest of the four Irish provinces both in terms of size and population. Galway is the only official city in the province.\nPhysical geography.\nThe highest point of Connacht is Mweelrea (814\u00a0m), in County Mayo. The largest island in Connacht (and Ireland) is Achill. The biggest lake is Lough Corrib.\nMuch of the west coast (e.g. Connemara and Erris) is ruggedly inhospitable and not conducive for agriculture. It contains the main mountainous areas in Connacht, including the Twelve Bens, Maumturks, Mweelrea, Croagh Patrick, Nephin Beg, Ox Mountains, and Dartry Mountains.\nKillary Harbour, one of Ireland's fjords (the others being Carlingford Lough and Lough Swilly), is located at the foot of Mweelrea. Connemara National Park is in County Galway. The Aran Islands, featuring prehistoric forts such as D\u00fan Aonghasa, have been a regular tourist destination since the 19th century.\nInland areas such as east Galway, Roscommon and Sligo have enjoyed greater historical population density due to better agricultural land and infrastructure.\nRivers and lakes include the River Moy, River Corrib, the Shannon, Lough Mask, Lough Melvin, Lough Allen and Lough Gill.\nHistory.\nEarly history.\nUp to the early historic era, Connacht then included County Clare, and was known as C\u00f3iced Ol nEchmacht. Later myths state the Fir Bolg ruled all Ireland before the Tuatha D\u00e9 Danann arrived. When the Fir Bolg were defeated, the Tuatha D\u00e9 Danann drove them to Connacht. Sites such as the C\u00e9ide Fields, Knocknarea, Listoghil, Carrowkeel Megalithic Cemetery and Rathcroghan, all demonstrate intensive occupation of Connacht far back into prehistory. Enigmatic artefacts such as the Turoe stone and the Castlestrange stone, whatever their purpose, denote the ambition and achievement of those societies, and their contact with the La T\u00e8ne culture of mainland Europe. In the early historic era (c. A.D. 300 \u2013 c. A.D. 600), Ol nEchmacht was not a united kingdom but a region. It comprised dozens of major and minor t\u00faath; rulers of larger t\u00faatha (Maigh Se\u00f3la, U\u00ed Maine, Aidhne and M\u00e1enmaige) were accorded high-king status, while peoples such as the Gailenga, Corco Moga and Senchineoil were lesser peoples given the status of D\u00e9isi. All were termed kingdoms, but according to a graded status, denoting each according the likes of lord, count, earl, king.\nSome of the more notable peoples or ethnic groups included the following:\nBy the 5th century, the pre-historic nations such as the Auteini and Nagnatae \u2013 recorded by Ptolemy (c. AD 90 \u2013 c. 168) in \"Geography\" \u2013 gave way to dynasties. This is demonstrated in the noun \"moccu\" in names such as Muirchu moccu Machtheni, which indicated a person was \"of the Machtheni people.\" As evidenced by kings such as Mac Cairthinn mac Coelboth (died 446) and Ailill Molt (died c. 482), even by the 5th century the gens was giving way to kinship all over Ireland, as both men were identified as of the U\u00ed Enechglaiss and U\u00ed Fiachrach dynasties, not of tribes. By 700, \"moccu\" had been entirely replaced by \"mac\" and \"hua\" (later \"Mac\" and \"\u00d3\").\nDuring the mid-8th century, what is now County Clare was absorbed into Thomond by the D\u00e9isi Tuisceart. It has remained a part of the province of Munster ever since.\nThe name Connacht arose from the most successful of these early dynasties, The Connachta. By 1050, they had extended their rule from Rathcroghan in north County Roscommon to large areas of what are now County Galway, County Mayo, County Sligo, and County Leitrim. The dynastic term was from then on applied to the overall geographic area containing those counties, and has remained so ever since.\nKingdom of Connacht.\nThe most successful sept of the Connachta were the \u00d3 Conchobair of S\u00edol Muireadaigh. They derived their surname from Conchobar mac Taidg M\u00f3r (c. 800 \u2013 882), from whom all subsequent \u00d3 Conchobair Kings of Connacht descended.\nConchobar was a nominal vassal of M\u00e1el Sechnaill mac M\u00e1ele Ruanaid, High King of Ireland (died 862). He married M\u00e1el Sechnaill's daughter, Ailbe, and had sons \u00c1ed mac Conchobair (died 888), Tadg mac Conchobair (died 900) and Cathal mac Conchobair (died 925), all of whom subsequently reigned. Conchobar and his sons' descendants expanded the power of the S\u00edol Muiredhaigh south into U\u00ed Maine, west into Iar Connacht, and north into U\u00ed Fiachrach Muaidhe and Br\u00e9ifne.\nBy the reign of \u00c1ed in Gai Bernaig (1046\u20131067), Connacht's kings ruled much what is now the province. Yet the \u00d3 Conchobair's contended for control with their cousins, the Ua Ruairc of U\u00ed Bri\u00fain Br\u00e9ifne. Four Ua Ruairc's achieved rule of the kingdom \u2013 Fergal Ua Ruairc (956\u2013967), Art Uallach Ua Ruairc (1030\u20131046), \u00c1ed Ua Ruairc (1067\u20131087), and Domnall Ua Ruairc (1098\u20131102). In addition, the usurper Flaithbertaigh Ua Flaithbertaigh gained the kingship in 1092 by the expedient of blinding King Ruaidr\u00ed na Saide Buide. After 1102 the Ua Ruairc's and Ua Flaithbertaigh's were suborned and confined to their own kingdoms of Br\u00e9ifne and Iar Connacht. From then until the death of the last king in 1474, the kingship was held exclusively by the \u00d3 Conchobair's.\nThe single most substantial sub-kingdom in Connacht was U\u00ed Maine, which at its maximum extent enclosed central and south County Roscommon, central, east-central and south County Galway, along with the territory of Lusmagh in Munster. Their rulers bore the family name \u00d3 Ceallaigh; its spelling sometimes varying slightly from scribe to scribe.\nThough the \u00d3 Ceallaigh's were never elevated to the provincial kingship, U\u00ed Maine existed as a semi-independent kingdom both before and after the demise of the Connacht kingship.\nKings and High Kings.\nUnder kings Tairrdelbach Ua Conchobair (1088\u20131156) and his son Ruaidr\u00ed Ua Conchobair (c. 1120\u20131198), Connacht became one of the five dominant kingdoms on the island. Tairrdelbach and Ruaidr\u00ed became the first men from west of the Shannon to gain the title \"Ard-R\u00ed na h\u00c9ireann\" (High King of Ireland). In the latter's case, he was recognised all over the island in 1166 as \"R\u00ed \u00c9ireann\", or King of Ireland.\nTairrdelbach was highly innovative, building the first stone castles in Ireland, and more controversially, introducing the policy of primogeniture to a hostile Gaelic polity. Castles were built in the 1120s at Galway (where he based his fleet), Dunmore, Sligo and Ballinasloe, where he dug a new six-mile canal to divert the river Suck around the castle of Dun L\u00f3. Churches, monasteries and dioceses were re-founded or created, works such as the Corpus Missal, the High Cross of Tuam and the Cross of Cong were sponsored by him.\nTairrdelbach annexed the Kingdom of Mide; its rulers, the Clann Cholm\u00e1in, became his vassals. This brought two of Ireland's five main kingdoms under the direct control of Connacht. He also asserted control over Dublin, which was even then being recognised as a kind of national capital.\nHis son, Ruaidr\u00ed, became king of Connacht \"without any opposition\" in 1156. One of his first acts as king was arresting three of his twenty-two brothers, \"Brian Breifneach, Brian Luighneach, and Muircheartach Muimhneach\" to prevent them from usurping him. He blinded Brian Breifneach as an extra precaution.\nRuaidr\u00ed was compelled to recognise Muirchertach Mac Lochlainn as Ard-R\u00ed, though he went to war with him in 1159. Mac Lochlainn's murder in 1166 left Ruaidr\u00ed the unopposed ruler of all Ireland. He was crowned in 1166 at Dublin, \"took the kingship of Ireland ...[and was] inaugurated king as honourably as any king of the Gaeidhil was ever inaugurated;\" He was the first and last native ruler who was recognised by the Gaelic-Irish as full King of Ireland.\nHowever, his expulsion of Dermot MacMurrough later that year brought about the Norman invasion of Ireland in 1169. Ruaidr\u00ed's inept response to events led to rebellion by his sons in 1177, and his deposition by Conchobar Maenmaige Ua Conchobair in 1183. Ruaidr\u00ed died at Cong in 1198, noted as the annals as late \"King of Connacht and of All Ireland, both the Irish and the English.\"\nHigh medieval era.\nConnacht was first raided by the Anglo-Normans in 1177 but not until 1237 did encastellation begin under Richard Mor de Burgh (c. 1194\u20131242). New towns were founded (Athenry, Headford, Castlebar) or former settlements expanded (Sligo, Roscommon, Loughrea, Ballymote). Both \"Gael and Gall\" acknowledged the supreme lordship of the Earl of Ulster; after the murder of the last earl in 1333, the Anglo-Irish split into different factions, the most powerful emerging as Bourke of Mac William Eighter in north Connacht, and Burke of Clanricarde in the south. They were regularly in and out of alliance with equally powerful Gaelic lords and kings such as \u00d3 Conchobair of S\u00edol Muireadaigh, \u00d3 Cellaigh of U\u00ed Maine and Mac Diarmata of Moylurg, in addition to extraprovincial powers such as \u00d3 Briain of Thomond, FitzGerald of Kildare, \u00d3 Domhnaill of T\u00edr Chonaill.\nLesser lords of both ethnicities included Mac Donnchadha, Mac Goisdelbh, Mac Bhaldrin, Mac Siurtain, \u00d3 hEaghra, \u00d3 Flaithbeheraigh, \u00d3 Dubhda, \u00d3 Seachnasaigh, \u00d3 Manach\u00e1in, Seoighe, \u00d3 M\u00e1ille, \u00d3 Ruairc, \u00d3 Madadh\u00e1in, Bair\u00e9ad, \u00d3 M\u00e1el Ruanaid, \u00d3 hEidhin, \u00d3 Finnaghtaigh, \u00d3 Fallmhain, Breathneach, Mac Airechtaig, \u00d3 Neachtain, \u00d3 hAllmhur\u00e1in, \u00d3 Fathaigh.\nThe town of Galway was the only significant urban area in the province. Its inhabitants governed themselves under charter of the king of England. Its merchant families, The Tribes of Galway, traded not only with the lordships around them and in Ireland, but with England, France, and Spain. Its mayor enjoyed supreme power but only for the length of his office, rarely more than a year. Galway's inhabitants were of mixed descent, its families bearing surnames of Gaelic, French, English, Welsh, Norman and other origins.\nConnacht was the site of two of the bloodiest battles in Irish history, the Second Battle of Athenry (1316) and the Battle of Knockdoe (1504). The casualties of both battles were measured in several thousand, unusually high for Irish warfare. A third battle at Aughrim in 1691 resulted in an estimated 10,000 deaths.\nAll of Connacht's lordships remained in states of full or semi-independence from other Gaelic-Irish and Anglo-Irish rulers until the late 16th century, when the Tudor conquest of Ireland (1534\u20131603) brought all under the direct rule of King James I of England. The counties were created from c. 1569 onwards.\nConfederate and Williamite Wars.\nDuring the 17th century representatives from Connacht played leading roles in Confederate Ireland and during the Williamite War in Ireland. Its main town, Galway, endured several sieges (see Sieges of Galway), while warfare, plague, famine and sectarian massacres killed about a third of the population by 1655. One of the last battles fought in pre-20th century Ireland occurred in Connacht, the Battle of Aughrim on 12 July 1691.\nEarly modern era.\nConnacht was mainly at peace between 1691 and 1798. In 1798 Connacht was a major backdrop to the Irish Rebellion of 1798 when French forces under General Jean Humbert of the French Republic landed in Killala, County Mayo to link up with the United Irishmen. Together, the French army and United Irishmen rebels defeated a force of Crown troops at the Races of Castlebar before proclaiming the Irish Republic, which later became better known as the \"Republic of Connacht\" as its area of effective control never extended beyond the province. The Republic, and the Rebellion itself, was effectively crushed at the Battle of Ballinamuck.\nA population explosion in the early 18th century was curbed by the Irish Famine, which led to many deaths and some emigration. Its memory has been overshadowed by the Great Famine (Ireland) one hundred years later.\nThe Famine to World War I.\nConnacht was the worst hit area in Ireland during the Great Famine, in particular, counties Mayo and Roscommon. In the Census of 1841, the population of Connacht stood at 1,418,859, the highest ever recorded. By 1851, the population had fallen to 1,010,031 and would continue to decline until the late 20th century.\nPolitics.\nConnacht\u2013Ulster was one of Ireland's four regional constituencies for elections to the European Parliament until it was superseded in 2004 by the constituency of North-West.\nIrish language.\nThe Irish language is spoken in the Gaeltacht areas of Counties Mayo and Galway, the largest area being in the west of County Galway. The Galway Gaeltacht is the largest Irish-speaking region in Ireland, taking in Cois Fharraige, parts of Connemara, Conamara Theas, the Aran Islands, D\u00faithche Sheoigeach (Joyce Country) and the Galway City Gaeltacht. Irish-speaking areas in County Mayo can be found in Iorras, Acaill and Tourmakeady.\nAccording to the 2016 census, Irish is spoken outside of the education system on a daily basis by 9,455 people in the Galway County Gaeltacht areas.\nThere are 202,667 Irish speakers in the province, over 84,000 in Galway and more than 55,000 in Mayo. There is also the 4,265 attending the 18 Gaelscoileanna (Irish language primary schools) and three Gaelchol\u00e1iste (Irish language secondary schools) outside the Gaeltacht across the province. Between 7% and 10% of the province are either native Irish speakers from the Gaeltacht, in Irish medium education or native Irish speakers who no longer live in Gaeltacht areas but still live in the province.\nSport.\nGaelic games.\nGaelic football and hurling dominate sport in Connacht with 212 Gaelic Athletic Association affiliated clubs in the province.\nGaelic football is played throughout the province with the five counties annually competing in the Connacht Senior Football Championship to determine the provincial champion. Galway are the most successful side in Connacht with 48 Connacht titles and 9 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship. Mayo have been the dominant force in the province in recent years winning a five-in-a-row of Connacht titles from 2011 to 2015, and have regularly reached the semi-finals and finals of the All-Ireland Senior Football Championship. No football team from Connacht has won the All-Ireland since Galway in 2001.\nHurling in Connacht mostly played in County Galway. Galway is the only team in the province to compete in the All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship winning the Liam MacCarthy Cup five times. The Galway hurling team compete in the Leinster Senior Hurling Championship due to the lack of competition in the province.\nRugby union.\nConnacht is represented by Connacht Rugby in the United Rugby Championship and the Rugby Champions Cup. Connacht home games are played in the Galway Sportsgrounds in Galway. During the 2015/2016 Season of the Pro12, Connacht, for the first time, reached the play off stages of the competition and won the final in Edinburgh against rivals Leinster. It was their first ever Pro12 title.\nConnacht-based teams who have played in the All-Ireland League include Buccaneers RFC, Galway Corinthians RFC, Galwegians RFC, Ballina RFC and Sligo RFC.\nOther sports.\nSome other sports are overseen by provincial bodies, including in association football, where the Connacht Football Association is the governing body for a number of Connacht league and cup competitions. Traditionally there have been two main senior men's teams from the province that compete on a national level, Galway United F.C. and Sligo Rovers F.C. Both clubs have won various domestic honours. \nCricket is a minor, but growing, sport within the province. The Connacht Cricket Union, founded in 2010, is the governing body for cricket in the province. There are cricket clubs based in Ballaghaderreen, Ballyhaunis, Galway, and Sligo. Connacht does not currently enter a team into the provincial competitions.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Determined to halt the decline of the Byzantine military and to stop Turkish incursions into the empire, he is nevertheless best known for his defeat and capture in 1071 at the Battle of Manzikert, which played a major role in undermining Byzantine authority in Anatolia and allowed for its gradual Turkification.\nSon of the general Constantine Diogenes and a prominent member of the Cappadocian Greek military aristocracy, Romanos rose to fame as a successful Akritai commander, serving in Syria and on the Danubian frontier. In 1068, he was crowned Byzantine emperor following his marriage to the dowager empress Eudokia Makrembolitissa. Early in his reign, Romanos campaigned with limited success against the Seljuk Turks in Anatolia and Syria. Domestically, his rule was marked by a series of unpopular policies as well as clashes with the rival Doukas family. In 1071, Romanos undertook another major campaign against the Seljuks. His Byzantine army, beset by years of neglect and poor tactics, was decisively defeated by the forces of Alp Arslan at Manzikert. Romanos himself was taken prisoner.\nTaking advantage of his capture, members of the Doukas family declared Romanos deposed and proclaimed Michael VII Doukas as emperor in a palace coup. When released, he was ultimately defeated by the Doukai in Cilicia and forced to surrender. Despite receiving a promise that he would be spared, Romanos was blinded and exiled to a monastery on Prote in the Sea of Marmara, where he died of his wounds in 1072.\nAccession to the throne.\nRomanos Diogenes was the son of Constantine Diogenes and a member of a prominent and powerful Byzantine Greek family from Cappadocia, the Diogenai, connected by birth to most of the great aristocratic nobles in Asia Minor. His mother was a daughter of Basil Argyros, brother of the emperor Romanos III. Courageous and generous, but also impetuous, Romanos rose with distinction in the army due to his military talents, and he served in Syria and on the Danubian frontier. At that time some parts from the theme of Bulgaria were organized as a new province with the centre at Serdica, and he became a duke of that province in 1067. However, he was eventually convicted of attempting to usurp the throne of the sons of Constantine X Doukas in 1067. While waiting to receive his sentence from the regent Eudokia Makrembolitissa, he was summoned into her presence and advised that she had pardoned him and that she had furthermore chosen him to be her husband and the guardian of her sons as emperor. She took this course of action primarily due to her concern that unless she managed to find a powerful husband, she could easily lose the regency to any unscrupulous noble, and also because she was infatuated with the popular Romanos. Her decision was met with little protest as the Seljuk Turks had overrun much of Cappadocia and had even taken the important city of Caesarea, meaning that the army needed to be placed under the command of an able and energetic general.\nAfter a written oath promising never to remarry, extracted from Eudokia by Constantine X, had been set aside by the Patriarch of Constantinople, John Xiphilinos, and the approval of the senate obtained, on 1 January 1068 Romanos married the empress and was crowned Emperor of the Romans.\nPhysical appearance and personality.\nByzantine Empress Eudokia Makrembolitissa was infatuated with Romanos; for according to Attaleiates, \u201cThe man not only surpassed others in his good qualities but he was also pleasant to look at in all respects.\u201d He was, however, \u201cvery harsh and violent in his judgments,\u201d says Michael the Syrian, and he once ordered the nose of a soldier to be cut off for stealing the donkey of a Muslim after the emperor had given his peace. \"One thing alone satisfied him: that he marched against his foes\". He was said to have been very brave, and would often go unarmed and without escort to fight with his enemies which would cause his worried generals to complain. Psellus confirms that Romanus \u201cexposed himself to danger without a thought of the consequences\u201d.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;I who was present [during an enemy surrender] did not approve of the simplicity of the emperor who mingled without body armour among murderous men who pass their lives in recklessness and madness\u2014\u200a\nRomanos grew contemptuous of the empress Eudokia for trying to control him.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The more she tried to dominate him, to treat him, who was really her master, like a lion in a cage, the more he fretted at her restraining influence and glared at the hand that kept him in check,\u201d writes Psellus, who knew them both. \u201cTo begin with, he growled inwardly, but as time passed his disgust became obvious to everyone\nCampaigns against the Turks.\nRomanos\u00a0IV was now the senior emperor and guardian of his stepsons and junior co-emperors, Michael VII, Konstantios, and Andronikos Doukas. However, his elevation had antagonised not only the Doukas family, in particular the \"Caesar\", John Doukas who led the opposition of the palace officials to Romanos' authority, but also the Varangian Guard, who openly expressed their discontent at the marriage of Eudokia. Romanos therefore decided that he could only exercise his authority by placing himself at the head of the army in the field, thereby focusing the whole government's attention on the war against the Turks.\nBy 1067, the Turks had been making incursions at will into Mesopotamia, Melitene, Syria, Cilicia, and Cappadocia, culminating with the sack of Caesarea and the plundering of the Church of St Basil. That winter they camped on the frontiers of the empire and waited for the next year's campaigning season. Romanos was confident of Byzantine superiority on the field of battle, looking on the Turks as little more than hordes of robbers who would melt away at the first encounter. He did not take into account the degraded state of the Byzantine forces, which had suffered years of neglect from his predecessors, in particular Constantine X Doukas. His forces, mostly composed of Sclavonian, Armenian, Bulgarian, and Frankish mercenaries, were ill-disciplined, disorganised, and uncoordinated, and he was not prepared to spend time in upgrading the arms, armour, or tactics of the once-feared Byzantine army.\nCampaign of 1068.\nThe first military operations of Romanos did achieve a measure of success, reinforcing his opinions about the outcome of the war. Antioch was exposed to the Saracens of Aleppo who, with help from Turkish troops, began an attempt to reconquer the Byzantine province of Syria. Romanos began marching to the southeastern frontier of the empire to deal with this threat, but as he was advancing towards Lykandos, he received word that a Seljuk army had made an incursion into Pontus and had plundered Neocaesarea. Immediately he selected a small mobile force and quickly raced through Sebaste and the mountains of Tephrike to encounter the Turks on the road, forcing them to abandon their plunder and release their prisoners, though a large number of the Turkish troops managed to escape.\nReturning south, Romanos rejoined the main army, and they continued their advance through the passes of Mount Taurus to the north of Germanicia and proceeded to invade the Emirate of Aleppo. Romanos captured Hierapolis, which he fortified to provide protection against further incursions into the south-eastern provinces of the empire. He then engaged in further fighting against the Saracens of Aleppo, but neither side managed a decisive victory. With the campaigning season reaching its end, Romanos returned north via Alexandretta and the Cilician Gates to Podandos. Here he was advised of another Seljuk Turkish raid into Asia Minor in which they sacked Amorium but returned to their base so fast that Romanos was in no position to give chase. He eventually reached Constantinople by January 1069.\nCampaign of 1069.\nPlans for the following year's campaigning were initially thrown into chaos by a rebellion by one of Romanos' Norman mercenaries, Robert Crispin, who led a contingent of Frankish troops in the pay of the empire. Possibly due to Romanos not paying them on time, they began plundering the countryside near where they were stationed at Edessa, and attacking the imperial tax collectors. Although Crispin was captured and exiled to Abydos, the Franks continued to ravage the Armeniac Theme for some time. In the meantime, the land around Caesarea was again overrun by the Turks, forcing Romanos to spend precious time and energy in expelling the Turks from Cappadocia. Desperate to begin his campaign proper, he ordered the execution of all prisoners, even a Seljuk chieftain who offered to pay an immense ransom for his life. Having brought a measure of peace to the province, Romanos marched towards the Euphrates via Melitene, and crossed the river at Romanopolis, hoping to take Akhlat on Lake Van and thus protect the Armenian frontier.\nRomanos placed himself at the head of a substantial body of troops and began his march towards Akhlat, leaving the bulk of the army under the command of Philaretos Brachamios with orders to defend the Mesopotamian frontier. Philaretos was soon defeated by the Turks, whose sack of Iconium forced Romanos to abandon his plans and return to Sebaste. He sent orders to the Dux of Antioch to secure the passes at Mopsuestia, while he attempted to run down the Turks at Heracleia. The Turks were soon hemmed in in the mountains of Cilicia, but they managed to escape to Aleppo after abandoning their plunder. Romanos once again returned to Constantinople without the great victory he was hoping for.\nAffairs at Constantinople.\nRomanos was detained at Constantinople in 1070, while he dealt with many outstanding administrative issues, including the imminent fall of Bari into Norman hands. They had been besieging it since 1068, but it had taken Romanos two years to respond. He ordered a relief fleet to set sail, containing sufficient provisions and troops to enable them to hold out for much longer. The fleet was intercepted, however, and defeated by a Norman squadron under the command of Roger, the younger brother of Robert Guiscard, forcing the final remaining outpost of Byzantine authority in Italy to surrender on 15 April 1071.\nMeanwhile, Romanos was undertaking a number of unpopular reforms at home. He reduced a great deal of unnecessary public expenditure on court ceremonials and beautifying the capital. He reduced the public salaries paid to much of the court nobility, as well as reducing the profits of tradesmen. His preoccupation with the military had also made him unpopular with the provincial governors and the military hierarchy, as he was determined to ensure they could not abuse their positions, especially through corrupt practices. He incurred the displeasure of the mercenaries by enforcing much needed discipline. Romanos was also deeply unpopular with the common people, as he neglected to entertain them with games at the hippodrome, nor did he alleviate the burdens of the peasants in the provinces.\nNevertheless, he did not forget his principal target, the Turks. Being unable to go on campaign himself, he entrusted the imperial army to one of his generals, Manuel Komnenos, nephew of the former emperor Isaac\u00a0I, and elder brother to the future emperor Alexios. He managed to engage the Turks in battle, but was defeated and taken prisoner by a Turkish general named Khroudj. Manuel convinced Khroudj to go to Constantinople and see Romanos in person to conclude an alliance, which was soon completed. This act motivated the Seljuk Sultan Alp Arslan to attack the Byzantine Empire, besieging and capturing the important Byzantine fortresses of Manzikert and Archesh. Romanos, in return, offered to officially exchange Manzikert and Archesh for Hieropolis in Syria, which Romanos had taken three years previously.\nBattle of Manzikert and capture by Alp Arslan.\nEarly in the spring of 1071, whilst conducting negotiations with Alp Arslan over Manzikert, Romanos marched at the head of a large army with the intent of recovering the fortress. It was soon evident that the army had a serious discipline problem, with soldiers regularly pillaging the area around their nightly camps. When Romanos attempted to enforce some stricter discipline, a whole regiment of German mercenaries mutinied, which the emperor only managed to control with the greatest difficulty. Believing that Alp Arslan was nowhere near Manzikert, he decided to divide his army. One part of the army he dispatched to attack Akhlat, at that time in possession of the Turks. Romanos himself advanced with the main body of the army on Manzikert, which he soon recaptured. At this point his advance guard met the Seljuk army, which was rapidly approaching Manzikert. Romanos ordered the forces attacking Akhlat to rejoin the army, but their portion of the army unexpectedly came across another large Turkish army, so Romanos' troops retreated toward Mesopotamia. Already understrength, Romanos' army was further weakened when his Uzes mercenaries deserted to the Turks. Arslan had no desire to take on the Byzantine army, so he proposed a peace treaty with favourable terms for Romanos. \nMichael Attaleiates claims that the Muslim envoy that was sent to Romanos was in reality, only there to stall for more time for the Seljuk army. One Muslim source confirms that the peace mission was a ploy \u201cto discover their [military] condition\u201d.\nThe emperor, eager for a decisive military victory, rejected the offer, and both armies lined up for a battle, which took place on 26 August 1071. The battle lasted all day without either side gaining any decisive advantage, until the emperor ordered a part of his centre to return to camp. The order was misunderstood by the right wing, however, and Andronikos Doukas, who commanded the reserves, and was the son of \"Caesar\" John Doukas, took advantage of the confusion to betray Romanos. Claiming that Romanos was dead, he marched away from the battle with some 30,000 men, instead of covering the emperor's retreat.\nWhen Romanos discovered what had happened, he tried to recover the situation by making a defiant stand. He fought on valiantly after his horse was killed under him, killing many enemies and causing others to flee, but he received a wound in the hand, which prevented him from wielding a sword, and he was soon taken prisoner.\nA number of other sources speak of the valor shown by Romanos at Manzikert: Romanos \u201claunched himself into the thick of the battle. He knocked down several very valiant Persian fighters and caused disarray in their ranks,\u201d according to a contemporary Armenian account. Michael Psellus, who was normally critical, begrudgingly writes, \u201cAccording to my several informants he actually killed many of them and put others to flight\u201d\nAccording to a number of Byzantine historians, including John Skylitzes, Arslan at first had difficulty believing the dusty and tattered warrior brought before him was the Roman emperor. Romanos and Arslan never expected to meet each other under such circumstances. He then stepped down from his seat and placed his foot on Romanos' neck. After this sign of ritual humiliation, however, Arslan raised Romanos from the ground and ordered him to be treated like a king. From then on he treated him with extreme kindness, never saying a cruel word to him during the Emperor's eight-day stay in his camp. He then released the Emperor in exchange for a treaty and the promise of a hefty ransom. At first Alp Arslan suggested a ransom of 10,000,000 \"nomismata\" to Romanos\u00a0IV, but he later reduced it to 1,500,000 \"nomismata\", with a further 360,000 \"nomismata\" annually.\nIt is reported that upon seeing the Roman emperor, the sultan leapt from his throne like a mad man, commanded Romanos to kiss the ground, and stepped on his neck. He repeatedly berated the emperor, including for spurning his emissaries and offers of peace. The unrepentant Romanos was laconic, and deigned only to offer the curtest responses to his captor's fiery upbraiding. He merely had done what was \u201cpossible for a man, and which kings are bound to do, and I have fallen short in nothing. But God has fulfilled his will. And now, do what you wish and abandon recriminations.\u201d\nOther Muslim sources claim Alp Arslan treated Romanos in a harsh and petty way. \u201cYou are too trivial in my view for me to kill you,\u201d the sultan is said to have declared before his Turks in Muslim sources. \u201cTake him to the person who pays most.\u201d When no one reportedly wanted to purchase the \u201cDog of the Romans,\u201d Alp Arslan scoffed that that was \u201cbecause the dog is better than he is!\u201d \u201cHe struck him three or four blows with his hand and when Romanos collapsed he kicked him a similar number of times\u201d; he \u201cput him in chains and fettered his hand to his neck\u201d; he pulled his hair and put his face to the ground, while informing him, \u201cyour troops are food for the Muslims.\u201d\nWanting to test the Roman, Alp Arslan then asked Romanos what he would do to him if he was his prisoner, Romanos frankly answered \"the worst!\". The answer impressed Alp Arslan and he said \"Ah! by Allah! He has spoken the truth! If he had spoken otherwise, he would be lying. This is an intelligent, tough man. It is not permissible that he should be killed.\" After agreeing on a ransom, Alp Arslan then sent emperor Romanos back to Constantinople with a Turkish escort that carried a banner above the disgraced emperor that read: \"There is no god but Allah and Muhammad is his messenger\".\nBetrayal.\nIn the meantime, the opposition faction scheming against Romanos\u00a0IV decided to exploit the situation. Declaring Romanos as deposed, Michael\u00a0VII was proclaimed emperor on c. 1 October 1071, although Eudokia co-ruled with Michael\u00a0VII for a month before being dispatched to a monastery. A month later, the \"caesar\" John Doukas and Michael Psellos forced Eudokia to retire to a monastery. They then refused to honor the agreement made between Arslan and the former emperor. Romanos soon returned, and he and the Doukas family gathered troops. A battle was fought between Constantine, Andronikos Doukas and Romanos. Romanos was defeated and retreated to the fortress of Tyropoion, and from there to Adana in Cilicia. Pursued by Andronikos, he was eventually forced to surrender by the garrison at Adana upon receiving assurances of his personal safety. Before leaving the fortress, he collected all the money he could lay his hands on and sent it to the Sultan as proof of his good faith, along with a message: \"As emperor, I promised you a ransom of a million and a half. Dethroned, and about to become dependent upon others, I send you all I possess as proof of my gratitude\".\nAndronikos stipulated that his life would be spared if he resigned the purple and retired into a monastery. Romanos agreed, and this agreement was ratified at Constantinople. However, John Doukas reneged on the agreement and sent men to ambush and have Romanos cruelly blinded on 29 June 1072 in Kotyaion. According to Attaleiates, the emperor was led away, pleading for mercy. Per Attaleiates, \"when he arose, his eyes were drenched with blood, a pathetic and pitiable sight that made everyone who saw it cry uncontrollably.\" He was then sent into exile to Prote in the Sea of Marmara. Without medical assistance, his wound became infected, and he soon endured a painfully lingering death. The final insult was given a few days before his death, when Romanos received a letter from Michael Psellos, congratulating him on the loss of his eyes. He finally died, praying for the forgiveness of his sins, and his widow Eudokia was permitted to honor his remains with a magnificent funeral.\nFamily.\nBy his first wife, Anne, daughter of Alusian of Bulgaria, Romanos\u00a0IV Diogenes had at least one son:\nBy his second wife, the Empress Eudokia Makrembolitissa, he had:\nIn popular culture.\nA highly fictionalized version of Romanos IV was portrayed by Nikolai Kinski in the 2022 Netflix series \"\".

{"id": "74202", "revid": "1398", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=74202", "title": "Stork", "text": "Type of wading bird\nStorks are large, long-legged, long-necked wading birds with long, stout bills. They belong to the family Ciconiidae, and make up the order Ciconiiformes . Ciconiiformes previously included a number of other families, such as herons and ibises, but those families have been moved to the order Pelecaniformes. \nStorks dwell in many regions and tend to live in drier habitats than the closely related herons, spoonbills and ibises; they also lack the powder down that those groups use to clean off fish slime. Bill-clattering is an important mode of communication at the nest. Many species are migratory. Most storks eat frogs, fish, insects, earthworms, small birds and small mammals. There are 20 living species of storks in six genera.\nVarious terms are used to refer to groups of storks, two frequently used ones being a \"muster\" of storks and a \"phalanx\" of storks.\nStorks tend to use soaring, gliding flight, which conserves energy. Soaring requires thermal air currents. Ottomar Ansch\u00fctz's famous 1884 album of photographs of storks inspired the design of Otto Lilienthal's experimental gliders of the late nineteenth century. Storks are heavy, with wide wingspans: the marabou stork, with a wingspan of and weight up to , joins the Andean condor in having the widest wingspan of all living land birds.\nTheir nests are often very large and may be used for many years. Some nests have been known to grow to over in diameter and about in depth. All storks were once thought to be monogamous, but this is only partially true. While storks are generally socially monogamous, some species exhibit regular extra-pair breeding.\nPopular conceptions of storks' fidelity, serial monogamy, and doting parental care contribute to their prominence in mythology and culture, especially in Western folklore as the deliverers of newborn humans.\nAll 20 stork species have been assessed by the IUCN and carry a confident Red List status. However, the assessments for several species were based on incorrect assumptions and a general lack of sound information on stork habits.\nEtymology.\nThe word \"stork\" was first used in its current sense by at least the 12th century in Middle English. It is derived from the Old English word , which itself comes from the hypothesised Proto-Germanic and ultimately the Proto-Indo-European . The name refers to the rigid posture of storks, a meaning reflected in the related word stark, which is derived from the Old English . Several species of storks are known by other common names. The jabiru is named after the Tup\u00ed-Guarani words meaning \"that which has\" and \"swollen\", referring to its thickset neck. The marabou stork is named after the Arabic word for holy man, , due to the perceived holy nature of the species. The adjutants are named after the military rank, referring to their stiff, military-like gait.\nSystematics.\nA DNA study found that the families Ardeidae, Balaenicipitidae, Scopidae and the Threskiornithidae belong to the Pelecaniformes. This would make Ciconiidae the only group.\nStorks were distinct and possibly widespread by the Oligocene. Like most families of aquatic birds, storks seem to have arisen in the Palaeogene, maybe 40\u201350 million years ago (mya). For the fossil record of living genera, documented since the Middle Miocene (about 15 mya) at least in some cases, see the genus articles.\nNo species or subspecies of stork is known to have gone extinct in historic times. A systematic literature review uncovered nearly 1,000 papers on storks, but showed most stork species to lack scientific understanding, suggesting that many species should be classified as Data Deficient on the IUCN Red List. A \"Ciconia\" bone found in a rock shelter on the island of R\u00e9union was probably of a bird taken there as food by early settlers; no known account mentions the presence of storks on the Mascarene Islands.\nPhylogeny.\nThe following phylogeny is recognized by the International Ornithological Congress, partially based on de Sousa \"et al\" (2023):\nFossil storks.\nThe fossil genera \"Eociconia\" (Middle Eocene of China) and \"Ciconiopsis\" (Deseado Early Oligocene of Patagonia, Argentina) are often tentatively placed with this family. A \"ciconiiform\" fossil fragment from the Touro Passo Formation found at Arroio Touro Passo (Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil) might be of the living wood stork \"M. americana\"; it is at most of Late Pleistocene age, a few 10,000s of years.\nMorphology.\nStorks range in size from the marabou, which stands tall and can weigh , to the Abdim's stork, which is only high and weighs only . Their shape is superficially similar to the herons, with long legs and necks, but they are more heavy-set. There is some sexual dimorphism (differences between males and females) in size, with males being up to 15% bigger than females in some species (for example, the saddle-billed stork), but almost no difference in appearance. The only difference is in the colour of the iris of the two species in the genus \"Ephippiorhynchus\".\nThe bills of storks are large to very large, and vary considerably between the genera. The shape of the bills is linked to the diet of the different species. The large bills of the \"Ciconia\" storks are the least specialized. Larger are the massive and slightly upturned bills of the \"Ephippiorhynchus\" and the jabiru. These have evolved to hunt for fish in shallow water. Larger still are the massive daggers of the two adjutants and marabou (\"Leptoptilos\"), which are used to feed on carrion and in defense against other scavengers, as well as for taking other prey. The long, ibis-like downcurved bills of the \"Mycteria\" storks have sensitive tips that allow them to detect prey by touch (tactilocation) where cloudy conditions would not allow them to see it. The most specialised bills of any storks are those of the two openbills (\"Anastomus\"), which as their name suggests, is open in the middle when their bill is closed. These bills have evolved to help openbills feed on their primary prey item, aquatic snails.\nAlthough it is sometimes reported that storks lack syrinxes and are mute, they do have syrinxes, and are capable of making some sounds, although they do not do so often. The syrinxes of storks are \"variably degenerate\" however, and the syringeal membranes of some species are found between tracheal rings or cartilage, an unusual arrangement shared with the ovenbirds.\nDistribution and habitat.\nStorks have a nearly cosmopolitan distribution, being absent from the poles, most of North America and large parts of Australia. The centres of stork diversity are in tropical Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, with eight and six breeding species respectively. Just three species are present in the New World: wood stork, maguari stork and jabiru, which is the tallest flying bird of the Americas. Two species, white and black stork, reach Europe and western temperate Asia, while one species, Oriental stork, reaches temperate areas of eastern Asia, and one species, black-necked stork, is found in Australasia.\nStorks are more diverse and common in the tropics, and the species that live in temperate climates for the most part migrate to avoid the worst of winter. They are fairly diverse in their habitat requirements. Some species, particularly the \"Mycteria \" \"wood storks\" and \"Anastomus\" openbills, are highly dependent on water and aquatic prey, but many other species are far less dependent on this habitat type, although they will frequently make use of it. Species like the marabou and Abdim's stork will frequently be found foraging in open grasslands of savannah. Preferred habitats include flooded grasslands, light woodland, marshes and paddyfields, wet meadows, river backwaters and ponds. Many species will select shallow pools, particularly when lakes or rivers are drying out, as they concentrate prey and make it harder for prey to escape, or when monsoonal rainfall increases water depth of larger waterbodies. Some species like the woolly-necked storks and lesser adjutant storks have adapted to changing crops of tropical agricultural landscapes that enables them to remain resident despite the transformations brought about by seasonal crops. In South Africa, the woolly-necked storks have adapted to artificial feeding and now largely nest on trees in gardens with swimming pools.\nLess typical habitats include the dense temperate forests used by European black storks, or the rainforest habitat sought by Storm's stork in South East Asia. They generally avoid marine habitats, with the exception of the lesser adjutant, milky stork and wood stork, all of which forage in mangroves, lagoons and estuarine mudflats. A number of species, especially woolly-necked storks, black-necked storks, Asian openbills, and lesser adjutant Storks in South Asia, have adapted to highly modified human habitats for foraging and breeding. In the absence of persecution several stork species breed close to people, and species such as the marabou, greater adjutant, and white stork feed at landfill sites.\nMigration and movements.\nStorks vary in their tendency towards migration. Temperate species like the white stork, black stork and Oriental stork undertake long annual migrations in the winter. The routes taken by these species have developed to avoid long-distance travel across water, and from Europe, this usually means flying across the Straits of Gibraltar or east across the Bosphorus and through Israel and the Sinai. Studies of young birds denied the chance to travel with others of their species have shown that these routes are at least partially learnt, rather than being innate as they are in passerine migrants. Migrating black storks are split between those that make stopovers on the migration between Europe and their wintering grounds in Africa, and those that do not.\nThe Abdim's stork is another migrant, albeit one that migrates within the tropics. It breeds in northern Africa, from Senegal to the Red Sea, during the wet season, and then migrates to Southern Africa. Many species that are not regular migrants will still make smaller movements if circumstances require it; others may migrate over part of their range. This can also include regular commutes from nesting sites to feeding areas. Wood storks have been observed feeding from their breeding colony.\nBehaviour.\nFeeding and diet.\nStorks are carnivorous predators, taking a range of reptiles, small mammals, insects, fish, amphibians and other small invertebrates. Storks usually hunt for animals in shallow water. Any plant material consumed is usually accidental. \"Mycteria\" storks are specialists in feeding on aquatic vertebrates, particularly when prey is concentrated by lowering water levels or flooding into shallows. On marine mudflats and mangrove swamps in Sumatra, milky storks feed on mudskippers, probing the burrow with the bill and even the whole head into the mud. The characteristic feeding method involves standing or walking in shallow water and holding the bill submerged in the water. When contact is made with prey, the bill reflexively snaps shut in 25 milliseconds, one of the fastest reactions known in any vertebrate. The reaction is able to distinguish between prey items and inanimate objects like branches, although the exact mechanism is unknown.\nOpenbills are specialists in freshwater molluscs, particularly apple snails. They feed in small groups, and sometimes African openbills ride on the backs of hippos while foraging. Having caught a snail, it will return to land or at least to the shallows to eat it. The fine tip of the bill of the openbills is used to open the snail, and the saliva has a narcotic effect, which causes the snail to relax and simplifies the process of extraction.\nThe other genera of storks are more generalised. \"Ciconia\" storks are very generalised in their diets, and some species, including Abdim's stork and marabous, will feed in large flocks on swarms of locusts and at wildfires. This is why white storks and Abdim's storks are known as \"grasshopper birds\". \"Ephippiorhynchus\" are carnivorous, though they have a very diverse diet when living in human-modified habitats such as agricultural landscapes. The foraging method used by the generalists is to stalk or walk across grassland or shallow water, watching for prey.\nBreeding.\nStorks range from being solitary breeders through loose breeding associations to fully colonial. The jabiru, \"Ephippiorhynchus\" storks and several species of \"Ciconia\" are entirely solitary when breeding. In contrast the \"Mycteria\" storks, Abdim's stork, openbills and \"Leptoptilos\" storks breed in colonies which can range from a couple of pairs to thousands. Many of these species breed in colonies with other waterbirds, which can include other species of storks, herons and egrets, pelicans, cormorants and ibises. White storks, Oriental storks and Maguari storks are all loosely colonial, and may breed in nests that are within visual range of others of the same species, but have little to do with one another. They also may nest solitarily, and the reasons why they choose to nest together or apart are not understood. Storks use trees in a variety of habitats to breed, including forests, cities, farmlands and large wetlands. \nIn culture.\nMany ancient mythologies feature stories and legends involving storks. In Ancient Egypt, saddle-billed storks were seen as being amongst the most powerful animals and were used to represent the \"ba\", the Ancient Egyptian conception of the soul, during the Old Kingdom. Bennu, an Egyptian deity that was later the inspiration for the phoenix, may also have been inspired by a stork, although it was more likely an ibis or heron.\nGreek and Roman mythology portrays storks as models of parental devotion. The 3rd century Roman writer Aelian, citing the authority of Alexander of Myndus, noted in his \"De natura animalium\" (book 3, chapter 23) that aged storks flew away to oceanic islands where they were transformed into humans as a reward for their piety towards their parents. Storks were also thought to care for their aged parents, feeding them and even transporting them, and children's books depicted them as a model of filial values. A Greek law called \"Pelargonia\", from the Ancient Greek word \"pelargos\" for stork, required citizens to take care of their aged parents. The Greeks also held that killing a stork could be punished with death.\nStorks feature in several of Aesop's Fables, most notably in The Farmer and the Stork, The Fox and the Stork, and The Frogs Who Desired a King. The first fable involves a stork caught with a group of cranes eating grain in a farmer's field, with the moral that those who associate with wicked people can be held accountable for their crimes. The Fox and the Stork involves a fox who invites a stork for dinner and provides soup in a dish that the stork cannot drink from, and is in turn invited for dinner by the stork and given food in a narrow jug which he cannot access. It cautions readers to follow the principle of do no harm. The third fable involves a group of frogs that are dissatisfied with the king that Zeus has given them, an inanimate log, and who are then punished with a new King Stork (a water-snake in some versions) who eats the frogs. \"King Stork\" has subsequently entered the English language as a term for a particularly tyrannical ruler.\nAssociations with fertility.\nAccording to European folklore, the white stork is responsible for bringing babies to new parents. The legend is very ancient, but was popularised by an 1839 Hans Christian Andersen story called \"The Storks\". German folklore held that storks found babies in caves or marshes and brought them to households in a basket on their backs or held in their beaks. These caves contained \"adebarsteine\" or \"stork stones\". The babies would then be given to the mother or dropped down the chimney. Households would signal their desire for children by leaving sweets for the stork on the windowsill. Subsequently, the folklore has spread around the world to the Philippines and countries in South America. Birthmarks on the back of the head of newborn babies, \"nevus flammeus nuchae\", are sometimes referred to as stork-bite. In Slavic mythology and pagan religion, storks were thought to carry unborn souls from Vyraj to Earth in spring and summer. This belief still persists in the modern folk culture of many Slavic countries, in the simplified child story that \"storks bring children into the world\".\nFamous is the role that the fable played in historical development of psychoanalysis: the name 'chimney sweeping', which the first of all patients gave to her talking cure, is a free association with the place through which the bird used to bring babies into house. Psychoanalyst Marvin Margolis suggests the enduring nature of the stork fable of the newborn is linked to its addressing a psychological need, in that it allays the discomfort of discussing sex and procreation with children. Birds have long been associated with the maternal symbols from pagan goddesses such as Juno, to the Holy Ghost, and the stork may have been chosen for its white plumage (depicting purity), size, and flight at high altitude (likened to flying between Earth and Heaven).\nThere were negative aspects to stork folklore as well; a Polish folktale relates how God made the stork's plumage white, while the Devil gave it black wings, imbuing it with both good and evil impulses. They were also associated with handicapped or stillborn babies in Germany, explained as the stork having dropped the baby en route to the household, or as revenge or punishment for past wrongdoing. A mother who was confined to bed around the time of childbirth was said to have been \"bitten\" by the stork. In Denmark, storks were said to toss a nestling off the nest and then an egg in successive years. In medieval England, storks were also associated with adultery, possibly inspired by their courtship rituals. Their preening and posture saw them linked with the attribute of self-conceit. Children of African American slaves were sometimes told that white babies were brought by storks, while black babies were born from buzzard eggs.\nAs food.\nStorks have never been a particularly common food, but occasionally featured in medieval banquets. They may also have been eaten in Ancient Egypt.\nFootnotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Following the 12th-century Norman invasion of Ireland, the historic \"fifths\" of Leinster and Meath gradually merged, mainly due to the impact of the Pale, which straddled both, thereby forming the present-day province of Leinster. The ancient kingdoms were shired into a number of counties for administrative and judicial purposes. In later centuries, local government legislation has prompted further sub-division of the historic counties.\nLeinster has no official function for local-government purposes. However, it is an officially recognised subdivision of Ireland and is listed on ISO 3166-2 as one of the four provinces of Ireland. \"IE-L\" is attributed to Leinster as its \"country sub-division\" code. Leinster had a population of 2,858,501 according to the preliminary results of the 2022 census, making it the most populous province in the country. The traditional flag of Leinster features a golden harp on a green background.\nHistory.\nEarly history.\nThe Gaelic Kingdom of Leinster before 1171, considerably smaller than the present-day province, usually did not include certain territories such as Meath, or the Viking cities of Wexford and Dublin.\nThe first part of the name \"Leinster\" derives from , the name of a major tribe that once inhabited the area. The latter part of the name derives either from the Irish or from the Old Norse , both of which translate as 'land' or 'territory'.\n (Hugony the Great), who supposedly built the hill fort of , near Kilcullen in County Kildare, united the tribes of Leinster. He is a likely, but uncertain, candidate as the first historical king of Laigin (Leinster) in the 7th century BC. Circa 175/185 AD, following a period of civil wars in Ireland, the legendary re-founded the kingdom of Laigin. The legendary Finn Mac Cool, or , reputedly built a stronghold at the Hill of Allen, on the edge of the Bog of Allen.\nIn the 4th and 5th centuries AD, after Magnus Maximus had left Britain in 383 AD with his legions, leaving a power vacuum, colonists from Laigin settled in North Wales, specifically in Anglesey, Carnarvonshire and Denbighshire. In Wales some of the Leinster-Irish colonists left their name on the Ll\u0177n Peninsula (in Gwynedd), which derives its name from .\nIn the 5th century, the emerging dynasties from Connacht conquered areas of Westmeath, Meath and Offaly from the and of the Laigin. attempted to exact the (cattle-tribute) from the Laigin from that time, in the process becoming their traditional enemies.\nBy the 8th century the rulers of Laigin had split into two dynasties:\nAfter the death of the last Kildare-based King of Laigin, in 1042, the kingship of Leinster reverted to the sept based in the southeast in present-day County Wexford. This southern dynasty provided all the later Kings of Leinster.\nKingdom of Ireland period.\nLeinster includes the extended \"English Pale\", counties controlled directly from Dublin, at the beginning of the 1600s. The other three provinces had their own regional \"Presidency\" systems, based on a Welsh model of administration, in theory if not in fact, from the 1570s and 1580s up to the 1670s, and were considered separate entities. Gradually \"Leinster\" subsumed the term \"The Pale\", as the kingdom was pacified and the difference between the old Pale area and the wider province, now also under English administration, grew less distinct.\nThe expansion of the province took in the territory of the ancient Kingdom of Mide encompassing much of present-day counties Meath, Westmeath and Longford with five west County Offaly baronies. Local lordships were incorporated during the Tudor conquest of Ireland and subsequent plantation schemes.\nOther boundary changes included County Louth, officially removed from Ulster in 1596, the baronies of Ballybritt and Clonlisk (formerly \u00c9ile U\u00ed Chearbhaill in the county palatine of Tipperary) in Munster becoming part of Leinster in 1606, and the 'Lands of Ballymascanlon' transferred from Armagh to Louth c.\u20091630. The provincial borders were redrawn by Cromwell for administration and military reasons, and the Offaly parishes of Annally and Lusmagh, formerly part of Connacht, were transferred in 1660.\nThe last major boundary changes within Leinster occurred with the formation of County Wicklow (1603\u20131606), from lands in the north of Carlow (which previously extended to the sea) and most of southern Dublin. Later minor changes dealt with \"islands\" of one county in another. By the late 1700s, Leinster looked as shown in the above map of 1784.\nGeography and subdivisions.\nCounties.\nThe province is divided into twelve traditional counties: Carlow, Dublin, Kildare, Kilkenny, Laois, Longford, Louth, Meath, Offaly, Westmeath, Wexford and Wicklow. Leinster has the most counties of any province, but is the second smallest of the four Irish provinces by land area. With a population of 2,870,354 as of 2022, it is the island's most populous province. Dublin is the only official city in the province, and is by far its largest settlement.\nLarge settlements.\nAs of the 2016 census, the larger settlements in Leinster included:\nCulture.\nLanguage.\nAs is the norm for language in Ireland, English is the primary spoken language, but there is an active Irish-speaking minority in the province. According to the Census of Ireland of 2011, there were 18,947 daily speakers of Irish in Leinster outside the education system, including 1,299 native speakers in the small Gaeltacht of R\u00e1th Chairn. As of 2011, there were 19,348 students attending the 66 Gaelscoils (Irish-language primary schools) and 15 Gaelchol\u00e1ist\u00ed (Irish-language secondary schools) in the province, primarily in the Dublin area.\nSport.\nA number of sporting and cultural organisations organise themselves on provincial lines, including Leinster Rugby, the Leinster Cricket Union, Leinster Hockey Association and Leinster GAA. While Leinster GAA is made up primarily of the traditional counties of the province, GAA teams from Galway, Kerry and Antrim have played in the Leinster Senior Hurling Championship, as has a team from London; Galway won the title in 2012. Participation of these counties is based on their performances in the Christy Ring Cup.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

These insects are usually solitary, but under certain circumstances they become more abundant and change their behaviour and habits, becoming gregarious. No taxonomic distinction is made between locust and grasshopper species; the basis for the definition is whether a species forms swarms under intermittently suitable conditions; this has evolved independently in multiple lineages, comprising at least 18 genera in 5 different subfamilies.\nNormally, these grasshoppers are innocuous, their numbers are low, and they do not pose a major economic threat to agriculture. However, under suitable conditions of drought followed by rapid vegetation growth, serotonin in their brains triggers dramatic changes: they start to breed abundantly, becoming gregarious and nomadic (loosely described as migratory) when their populations become dense enough. They form bands of wingless nymphs that later become swarms of winged adults. Both the bands and the swarms move around, rapidly strip fields, and damage crops. The adults are powerful fliers; they can travel great distances, consuming most of the green vegetation wherever the swarm settles.\nLocusts have formed plagues since prehistory. The ancient Egyptians carved them on their tombs and the insects are mentioned in the \"Iliad\", the Mahabharata, the Bible and Quran. Swarms have devastated crops and have caused famines and human migrations. More recently, changes in agricultural practices and better surveillance of locust breeding grounds have allowed control measures at an early stage. Traditional locust control uses insecticides from the ground or air, but newer biological control methods are proving effective. Swarming behaviour decreased in the 20th century, but despite modern surveillance and control methods, swarms can still form; when suitable weather conditions occur and vigilance lapses, plagues can occur.\nLocusts are large insects and convenient for research and classroom study of zoology. They are edible by humans. They have been eaten throughout history and are considered a delicacy in many countries.\nSwarming grasshoppers.\nLocusts are the swarming phase of certain species of short-horned grasshoppers in the family Acrididae. These insects are usually solitary, but under certain circumstances become more abundant and change their behaviour and habits, becoming gregarious.\nNo taxonomic distinction is made between locust and grasshopper species; the basis for the definition is whether a species forms swarms under intermittently suitable conditions. In English, the term \"locust\" is used for grasshopper species that change morphologically and behaviourally on crowding, forming swarms that develop from bands of immature stages called hoppers. The change is described as density-dependent phenotypic plasticity.\nThese changes are examples of phase polyphenism; they were first analysed and described by Boris Uvarov, who was instrumental in setting up the Anti-Locust Research Centre. He made his discoveries during his studies of the migratory locust in the Caucasus, whose solitary and gregarious phases had previously been thought to be separate species (\"Locusta migratoria\" and \"L. danica\" L.). He designated the two phases as \"solitaria\" and \"gregaria\". These are called statary and migratory morphs, though strictly speaking, their swarms are nomadic rather than migratory. Charles Valentine Riley and Norman Criddle were involved in achieving the understanding and control of locusts.\nSwarming behaviour is a response to overcrowding. Increased tactile stimulation of the hind legs causes an increase in levels of serotonin. This causes the locust to change colour, eat much more, and breed much more easily. The transformation of the locust to the swarming form is induced by several contacts per minute over a four-hour period. A large swarm can consist of billions of locusts spread out over an area of thousands of square kilometres, with a population of up to 80 million per square kilometre (200 million per square mile). When desert locusts meet, their nervous systems release serotonin, which causes them to become mutually attracted, a prerequisite for swarming.\nThe formation of initial bands of gregarious hoppers is called an \"outbreak\"; when these join into larger groups, the event is known as an \"upsurge\". Continuing agglomerations of upsurges on a regional level originating from a number of entirely separate breeding locations are known as \"plagues\". During outbreaks and the early stages of upsurges, only part of the locust population becomes gregarious, with scattered bands of hoppers spread out over a large area. As time goes by, the insects become more cohesive and the bands become concentrated in a smaller area. In the desert locust plague in Africa, the Middle East, and Asia that lasted from 1966 to 1969, the number of locusts increased from two to 30 billion over two generations, but the area covered decreased from over to .\nSolitary and gregarious phases.\nOne of the greatest differences between the solitary and gregarious phases is behavioural. The \"gregaria\" nymphs are attracted to each other, this being seen as early as the second instar. They soon form bands of many thousands of individuals. These groups behave like cohesive units and move across the landscape, mostly downhill, but making their way around barriers and merging with other bands. The attraction between the insects involves visual and olfactory cues. The bands seem to navigate using the sun. They pause to feed at intervals before continuing on, and may cover tens of kilometres over a few weeks.\nLocusts in the gregarious phase differ in morphology and development. In the desert locust and the migratory locust, for example, the \"gregaria\" nymphs become darker with strongly contrasting yellow and black markings, they grow larger, and have a longer nymphal period; the adults are larger with different body proportions, less sexual dimorphism, and higher metabolic rates; they mature more rapidly and start reproducing earlier, but have lower levels of fecundity.\nThe mutual attraction between individual insects continues into adulthood, and they continue to act as a cohesive group. Individuals that get detached from a swarm fly back into the mass. Others that get left behind after feeding take off to rejoin the swarm when it passes overhead. When individuals at the front of the swarm settle to feed, others fly past overhead and settle in their turn, the whole swarm acting like a rolling unit with an ever-changing leading edge. The locusts spend much time on the ground feeding and resting, moving on when the vegetation is exhausted. They may then fly a considerable distance before settling in a location where transitory rainfall has caused a green flush of new growth.\nDistribution and diversity.\nSeveral species of grasshoppers swarm as locusts in different parts of the world, on all continents except Antarctica: For example, the Australian plague locust (\"Chortoicetes terminifera\") swarms across Australia.\nThe desert locust (\"Schistocerca gregaria\") is probably the best known species owing to its wide distribution (North Africa, Middle East, and Indian subcontinent) and its ability to migrate over long distances. A major infestation covered much of western Africa from 2003 to 2005, after unusually heavy rain set up favourable ecological conditions for swarming. The first outbreaks occurred in Mauritania, Mali, Niger, and Sudan in 2003. The rain allowed swarms to develop and move north to Morocco and Algeria, threatening croplands. Swarms crossed Africa, appearing in Egypt, Jordan and Israel, the first time in those countries for 50 years. The cost of handling the infestation was put at US$122\u00a0million, and the damage to crops at up to $2.5\u00a0billion.\nThe migratory locust (\"Locusta migratoria\"), sometimes classified into up to 10 subspecies, swarms in Africa, Asia, Australia, and New Zealand, but has become rare in Europe. In 2013, the Madagascan form of the migratory locust formed many swarms of over a billion insects, reaching \"plague\" status and covering about half the country by March 2013. \nSpecies such as the Senegalese grasshopper (\"Oedaleus senegalensis\") and the African rice grasshopper (\"Hieroglyphus daganensis\"), both from the Sahel, often display locust-like behaviour and change morphologically on crowding.\nNorth America is the only sub-continent besides Antarctica without a native locust species. The Rocky Mountain locust was formerly one of the most significant insect pests there, but it became extinct in 1902. In the 1930s, during the Dust Bowl, a second species of North American locust, the High Plains locust (\"Dissosteira longipennis\"), reached plague proportions in the American Midwest. Today, the High Plains locust is a rare species, leaving North America with no regularly swarming locusts.\nEvolution.\nThe fossilized wing of an indeterminate locust has been found in Early Oligocene-aged sediments of the Pabdeh Formation in Iran, which were deposited in a deep marine environment. The locust was likely migrating across the early Paratethys Sea, between the emergent Arabian Peninsula and central Iran, which were still separated by large areas of deep ocean at this time. This suggests that trans-oceanic locust migrations have been occurring for at least 30 million years, likely facilitated by the spread of grasslands at the time.\nInteraction with humans and animals.\nAncient times.\nStudy of literature shows how pervasive plagues of locusts were over the course of history. The insects arrived unexpectedly, often after a change of wind direction or weather, and the consequences were devastating. The Ancient Egyptians carved locusts on tombs in the period 2470 to 2220 BC. A devastating plague in Egypt is mentioned in the Book of Exodus in the Bible. Locust plague is mentioned in the Indian \"Mahabharata\". The \"Iliad\" mentions locusts taking to the wing to escape fire. Plagues of locusts are mentioned in the Quran. In the ninth century BC, the Chinese authorities appointed anti-locust officers. In the New Testament, John the Baptist was said to survive in the wilderness on locusts and wild honey; and human-headed locusts appear in the Book of Revelation.\nAristotle studied locusts and their breeding habits and Livy recorded a devastating plague in Capua in 203 BC. He mentioned human epidemics following locust plagues which he associated with the stench from the putrifying corpses; the linking of human disease outbreaks to locust plagues was widespread. A pestilence in the northwestern provinces of China in 311 AD that killed 98% of the population locally was blamed on locusts, and may have been caused by an increase in numbers of rats (and their fleas) that devoured the locust carcasses.\nRecent times.\nDuring the last two millennia, desert locust plagues have appeared sporadically in Africa, the Middle East, and Europe. Other species of locusts caused havoc in North and South America, Asia, and Australasia; in China, 173 outbreaks over 1924 years. The Bombay locust (\"Nomadacris succincta\") was a major pest in India and southeastern Asia in the 18th and 19th centuries, but has seldom swarmed since the last plague in 1908.\nIn the spring of 1747 locusts arrived outside Damascus eating the majority of the crops and vegetation of the surrounding countryside. One local barber, Ahmad al-Budayri, recalled the locusts \"came like a black cloud. They covered everything: the trees and the crops. May God Almighty save us!\"\nThe extinction of the Rocky Mountain locust has been a source of puzzlement. It had swarmed throughout the west of the United States and parts of Canada in the 19th century. Albert's swarm of 1875 was estimated to contain 12.5 trillion insects covering an area of (larger than the state of California) and to weigh 27.5 million tons. The last specimen was seen alive in Canada in 1902. Recent research suggests the breeding grounds of this insect in the valleys of the Rocky Mountains came under sustained agricultural development during the large influx of gold miners, destroying the underground eggs of the locust.\nThe 1915 infestation across Palestine and Syria was one of the main contributors to famine in Lebanon which lasted from 1915 to 1918 during which around 200,000 people died. Plagues became less common in the 20th century, but they continue to occur when the conditions are met.\nMonitoring.\nEarly intervention to prevent large locust swarms is more successful than later action once swarms have built up. The means to control locust populations is now available, but organisational, financial, and political problems may be difficult to overcome. Monitoring is the key to early detection and eradication. Ideally, a sufficient proportion of nomadic bands can be killed with insecticide before their swarming phase. This may be possible in richer countries like Morocco and Saudi Arabia, but neighbouring poorer countries such as Mauritania and Yemen lack the resources and may breed locust swarms that threaten the whole region.\nSeveral organisations around the world monitor the threat from locusts. They provide forecasts detailing regions likely to suffer from locust plagues in the near future. In Australia, this service is provided by the Australian Plague Locust Commission. It has been very successful in dealing with developing outbreaks, but has the great advantage of having a defined area to monitor and defend without locust invasions from elsewhere. In Central and Southern Africa, the service is provided by the International Locust Control Organization for Central and Southern Africa. In West and Northwest Africa, the service is co-ordinated by the Food and Agriculture Organization's Commission for Controlling the Desert Locust in the Western Region, and executed by locust control agencies belonging to each country concerned. The FAO monitors the situation in the Caucasus and Central Asia, where over 25 million hectares of cultivated land are under threat. In February 2020, in an effort to end massive locust outbreaks, India decided to use drones and special equipment to monitor locusts and spray insecticides.\nControl.\nHistorically, people could do little to protect their crops from locusts, although eating the insects may have been some compensation. By the early 20th century, efforts were made to disrupt the development of the insects by cultivating the soil where eggs were laid, collecting hoppers with catching machines, killing them with flamethrowers, trapping them in ditches, and crushing them with rollers and other mechanical methods. By the 1950s, the organochloride dieldrin was found to be an extremely effective insecticide, but it was later banned in most countries because of its persistence in the environment and its accumulation in the food chain.\nIn years when locust control is needed, the hoppers are targeted early by applying water-based contact pesticides from tractor-based sprayers. This is effective but slow and labour-intensive; a preferable method is spraying concentrated insecticide from aircraft over the insects or vegetation. The use of ultralow-volume spraying of contact pesticides from aircraft in overlapping swathes is effective against nomadic bands and can be used to treat large areas of land swiftly. Other modern technologies for planning locust control include GPS, GIS tools, and satellite imagery with rapid computer data management and analysis.\nA biological pesticide to control locusts was tested across Africa by the multinational LUBILOSA team in 1997. Dried fungal spores of a \"Metarhizium acridum\" sprayed in breeding areas pierce the locust exoskeleton on germination and invade the body cavity, causing death. The fungus is passed from insect to insect and persists in the area, making repeated treatments unnecessary. This approach to locust control was used in Tanzania in 2009 to treat around 10,000 hectares in the Iku-Katavi National Park infested with adult locusts. The outbreak was contained without harm to the local elephants, hippopotamuses, and giraffes.\nAs experimental models.\nThe locust is large and easy to breed and rear, and is used as an experimental model in research studies. It has been used in evolutionary biology research and to test the generalizability of conclusions reached about test organisms such as the fruit fly (\"Drosophila\") and the housefly (\"Musca\"). It is a suitable school laboratory animal because of its robustness and ease of breeding and handling.\nAt Tel Aviv University, scientists have been using the antennae's acute sensitivity of Sense of smell to detect different odors in various technologies.\nAs food.\nLocusts have been used as food throughout history. They are considered meat. Several cultures throughout the world consume insects, and locusts are considered a delicacy in many African, Middle Eastern, and Asian countries.\nThey can be cooked in many ways, but are often fried, smoked, or dried.\nThe Bible records that John the Baptist ate locusts and wild honey () while living in the wilderness. Attempts have been made to explain the text to mean ascetic vegetarian food such as carob beans, but the plain meaning of the Greek \"akrides\" is locust.\nThe Torah prohibits the use of most insects as food, but it permits consuming certain types of locust; specifically, those that are red, yellow, or spotted grey. Islamic jurisprudence deems eating locusts to be halal. The Prophet Muhammad was reported to have eaten locusts during a military raid with his companions.\nLocusts are eaten in the Arabian Peninsula, including Saudi Arabia. In 2014, consumption of locusts spiked around Ramadan especially in the Al-Qassim Region, since many Saudis believe they are healthy to eat, but the Saudi Ministry of Health warned that pesticides made them unsafe. Yemenis also consume locusts, and expressed discontent over governmental plans to use pesticides against them. \u02bbAbd al-Sal\u00e2m Shab\u00een\u00ee described a locust recipe from Morocco. 19th century European travellers observed Arabs in Arabia, Egypt, and Morocco selling, cooking, and eating locusts. They reported that in Egypt and Palestine locusts were consumed, and that in Palestine, around the River Jordan, in Egypt, in Arabia, and in Morocco that Arabs ate locusts, while Syrian peasants did not eat locusts.\nIn the Haouran region, Fellahs who were in poverty and suffered from famine ate locusts after removing the guts and head, while locusts were swallowed whole by Bedouins. Syrians, Copts, Greeks, Armenians, and other Christians and Arabs themselves reported that in Arabia locusts were eaten frequently and one Arab described to a European traveler the different types of locusts which were favored as food by Arabs. Persians use the Anti-Arab racial slur \"Arabe malakh-khor\" (, literally \"locust eater Arab\") against Arabs.\nLocusts yield about five times more edible protein per unit of fodder than cattle, and produce lower levels of greenhouse gases in the process. The feed conversion rate of orthopterans is 1.7\u00a0kg/kg, while for beef it is typically about 10\u00a0kg/kg. The protein content in fresh weight is between 13 and 28\u00a0g / 100\u00a0g for adult locust, 14\u201318\u00a0g / 100\u00a0g for larvae, as compared to 19\u201326\u00a0g / 100\u00a0g for beef. The calculated protein efficiency ratio is low, with 1.69 for locust protein compared to 2.5 for standard casein. A serving of 100\u00a0g of desert locust provides 11.5\u00a0g of fat, 53.5% of which is unsaturated, and 286\u00a0mg of cholesterol. Among the fatty acids, palmitoleic, oleic, and linolenic acids were found to be the most abundant. Varying amounts of potassium, sodium, phosphorus, calcium, magnesium, iron, and zinc were present.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Also known as \"John the Beautiful\" or \"John the Good\" (), he was the eldest son of Emperor Alexios\u00a0I Komnenos and Irene Doukaina and the second emperor to rule during the Komnenian restoration of the Byzantine Empire. As he was born to a reigning emperor, he had the status of a . John was a pious and dedicated monarch who was determined to undo the damage his empire had suffered following the Battle of Manzikert, half a century earlier.\nJohn has been assessed as the greatest of the Komnenian emperors. This view became entrenched due to its espousal by George Ostrogorsky in his influential book \"History of the Byzantine State\", where John is described as a ruler who, \"... combined clever prudence with purposeful energy ... and [was] high principled beyond his day.\" In the course of the quarter-century of his reign, John made alliances with the Holy Roman Empire in the west, decisively defeated the Pechenegs, Hungarians and Serbs in the Balkans, and personally led numerous campaigns against the Turks in Asia Minor. John's campaigns fundamentally changed the balance of power in the east, forcing the Turks onto the defensive; they also led to the recapture of many towns, fortresses and cities across the Anatolian peninsula. In the southeast, John extended Byzantine control from the Maeander in the west all the way to Cilicia and Tarsus in the east. In an effort to demonstrate the Byzantine ideal of the emperor's role as the leader of the Christian world, John marched into Muslim Syria at the head of the combined forces of Byzantium and the Crusader states; yet despite the great vigour with which he pressed the campaign, John's hopes were disappointed by the evasiveness of his Crusader allies and their reluctance to fight alongside his forces.\nUnder John, the empire's population recovered to about 10 million people. The quarter-century of John II's reign is less well recorded by contemporary or near-contemporary writers than the reigns of either his father, Alexios I, or his son, Manuel I. In particular little is known of the history of John's domestic rule or policies.\nPhysical appearance and character.\nThe Latin historian William of Tyre described John as short and unusually ugly, with eyes, hair and complexion so dark he was known as 'the Moor'. Yet despite his physical appearance, John was known as \"Kalo\u00ef\u014dann\u0113s\", \"John the Good\" or \"John the Beautiful\"; the epithet referred to his character. Both his parents were unusually pious and John surpassed them. Members of his court were expected to restrict their conversation to serious subjects only. The food served at the emperor's table was very frugal and John lectured courtiers who lived in excessive luxury. His speech was dignified, but he engaged in repartee on occasion. All accounts agree that he was a faithful husband to his wife, an unusual trait in a medieval ruler. Despite his personal austerity, John had a high conception of the imperial role and would appear in full ceremonial splendour when this was advantageous.\nJohn was famed for his piety and his remarkably mild and just reign. He is considered an exceptional example of a moral ruler, at a time when cruelty was the norm. He is reputed never to have condemned anyone to death or mutilation. Charity was dispensed lavishly. For this reason, he has been called the Byzantine Marcus Aurelius. By the example of his personal morality and piety he effected a notable improvement in the manners of his age. Descriptions of him and his actions indicate that he had great self-control and personal courage, and was an excellent strategist and general.\nEarly life.\nJohn was born on 13 September 1087, the third child and first son of Emperor Alexios I Komnenos and his wife Irene Doukaina. Joannes Zonaras describes John's birth, \"And then a son was born to the emperor, who was honoured with the holy baptism in the holy church of Hagia Sophia by the Patriarch. He was named John and his father then crowned him with a diadem\". At a young age he was associated with his father as co-emperor, sometime between 1 September and early November, 1092. The first act in the name of both emperors was issued on 15 November 1092. The occasion of John's elevation was celebrated by a special issue of coins with his parents depicted on the reverse and John crowned by Christ on the obverse.\nAlexios I arranged a dynastic marriage for John. In 1104 or early 1105 John was married to the Hungarian princess Piroska, daughter of King Ladislaus I of Hungary. She was given the Greek name Irene, meaning 'peace', in Byzantium. This marriage sealed a political alliance, which would strengthen Byzantium's position in the Balkans and Adriatic. In 1106 Alexios I was campaigning against the Serbs, most probably accompanied by his son John. At this time John's wife was heavily pregnant, she was with her husband on campaign, giving birth to twins, Alexios and Maria, in Balabista, Macedonia. The question arises as to why the birth was not in Constantinople. It is reasonably supposed that John did not wish to leave his unsupported wife under the control of his mother, who would have had authority in Constantinople in the absence of both emperors. In 1108, the Treaty of Devol recorded the submission of the defeated Bohemond I of Antioch to \" ... the great Emperor Kyr[ios] Alexios Komnenos and of your thrice-loved son, Emperor Kyr John born in the purple\". This leaves no doubt as to John's status as co-emperor and heir apparent.\nAccession to the throne.\nJohn II succeeded his father as ruling \"basileus\" in 1118. Despite his earlier coronation as co-emperor, the accession of John was contested. That Alexios\u00a0I favoured John to succeed him is made obvious by the elevation of his son to the position of co-emperor. However, Alexios' influential wife, Irene, favoured the \"Caesar\" Nikephoros Bryennios, the husband of her eldest child Anna Komnene. Anna, who in infancy had been betrothed to her father's first co-emperor Constantine Doukas, herself harboured obvious aspirations to power and the throne. During Alexios' final illness both wife and daughter exploited his physical weakness to apply pressure on him in support of their agenda for the succession. Alexios endured these constant demands without formally changing his intended successor. As Alexios lay dying in the monastery of the Mangana on 15 August 1118, John, relying on trusted relatives, especially his brother Isaac Komnenos, gained entry into the monastery and obtained the imperial signet ring from his father. He then assembled his armed followers and rode to the Great Palace, gathering the support of the citizenry on the way. The palace guard at first refused to admit John without clear proof of his father's wishes, however, the mob surrounding the new emperor simply forced an entry. In the palace John was acclaimed emperor. Irene, taken by surprise, was unable either to persuade her son to step down, or to induce Nikephoros to contend for the throne. In a recent biography of Anna, however, this account of events has been disputed, in particular the involvement of John's sister in any palace coup attempt during the days around Alexios' death, has been questioned. The weight of historical opinion remains that Anna tried at least twice to usurp her brother's throne, resulting in her eventual perennial 'house arrest'. Anna later complained that John and his successor, her nephew Emperor Manuel, kept her isolated from society for 30 years.\nAlexios died the night following his son's decisive move to take power. John refused to attend his father's funeral, despite the pleas of his mother, because he feared a counter-coup. However, in the space of a few days, his position seemed secure. Within a year of his accession, however, John\u00a0II uncovered a conspiracy to overthrow him which implicated his mother and sister. Anna's husband Nikephoros had little sympathy with her ambitions, and it was his lack of support which doomed the conspiracy. Anna was stripped of her property, which was offered to the emperor's friend John Axouch. Axouch wisely declined and his influence ensured that Anna's property was eventually returned to her and that John II and his sister became reconciled, at least to a degree. Irene retired to a monastery and Anna seems to have been effectively removed from public life, taking up the less active occupation of historian. However, Nikephoros remained on good terms with his brother-in-law. One of the very few records of John's own words concerns the plot against him; he says that after ascending the throne, God \"destroyed the cunning plots of my visible and invisible enemies and rescued me from every trap subjecting all my enemies under my feet\". To safeguard his own succession, John crowned his young son Alexios as co-emperor around September 1119.\nMilitary and civil administration.\nThe family intrigues that challenged his succession to the throne probably contributed to John's approach to rulership, which was to appoint men from outside the imperial family to high office. This was a radical departure from the methods of his father, who had used the imperial family and its many connections to fill almost all senior administrative and military posts.\nJohn Axouch was John II's closest adviser and was his only intimate friend. Axouch was a Turk captured as a child at the Siege of Nicaea, who had been given as a gift to John's father. Emperor Alexios had thought him a good companion for his son, and so he had been brought up alongside the prince in the imperial household. Axouch was immediately appointed Grand Domestic (in Greek: \u03bc\u03ad\u03b3\u03b1\u03c2 \u03b4\u03bf\u03bc\u03ad\u03c3\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03bf\u03c2, \"megas domestikos\"), upon the accession of John II. The Grand Domestic was the commander in chief of the Byzantine armies. It has been suggested that references to Axouch's possession of the imperial seal early in the reign of John's successor Manuel I meant that he was, in addition to his military duties, the head of the civil administration of the Empire. This was an unofficial position known at the time as the \"mesazon\", and equivalent to a vizier or 'prime-minister.' Such an appointment was remarkable, and a radical departure from the nepotism that had characterised the reign of Alexios I. The imperial family harboured some degree of resentment at this decision, which was reinforced by the fact that they were required to make obeisance to John Axouch whenever they met him.\nJohn's unwillingness to allow his family to influence his government to any great extent was to remain constant for the rest of his reign. John appointed a number of his father's former officials to senior administrative posts, men such as Eustathios Kamytzes, Michaelitzes Styppeiotes and George Dekanos. These were men who had been politically eclipsed during the ascendancy exercised by John's mother in the later years of the reign of Alexios I. A number of 'new men' were raised to prominence by John II, these included Gregory Taronites who was appointed protovestiarios, Manuel Anemas and Theodore Vatatzes, the latter two also became his sons-in-law. John's marriage policy, of bringing new families into the imperial orbit, may have been directed towards lessening the influence of certain prominent aristocratic clans, such as the Doukas, Diogenes and Melissenos families, some of which had produced emperors themselves in the past.\nDespite his move away from close reliance on the imperial family and its connections, John's court and government had many similarities to that of his father, not least in its serious tone and piety. Indeed, an extant collection of political advice couched in poetic form, called the \"Mousai\", are attributed to Alexios I. The \"Mousai\" are addressed directly to John II and exhort him, amongst other things, to maintain justice during his reign and a full treasury. Alexios' advice on rulership therefore continued to be available to his son, even after the old emperor's death.\nThe increase in military security and economic stability within Byzantine western Anatolia created by John II's campaigns allowed him to begin the establishment of a formal provincial system in these regions. The theme (province) of Thrakesion was re-established, with its administrative centre at Philadelphia. A new theme, named Mylasa and Melanoudion, was created to the south of Thrakesion.\nConspiracies of the \"sebastokrator\" Isaac.\nThe younger brother of John II, Isaac, had been of essential support during the accession crisis. However, despite being given the highest of court titles, that of \"sebastokrator\", Isaac later became estranged from his brother and became an active conspirator. With trusted advisors of his own choosing, such as John Axouch, and later the support of his son and co-emperor, Alexios, John II offered no meaningful role to Isaac in the governance of the empire. In the reign of Alexios I \"sebastokratores\" had wielded considerable power and Isaac would have had an expectation of a similar level of authority being devolved on himself. This thwarted ambition is probably what disillusioned Isaac with his brother's rule. Isaac aimed at replacing his brother as emperor. In 1130 John became aware of a plot involving Isaac and other magnates as he was leaving to campaign against the Turks. When John tried to seize Isaac, the latter escaped and fled to the Danishmend emir Ghazi, who received him, and later sent him to the breakaway Byzantine regime of the Gabrades in Trebizond. Isaac then became the guest of Masoud, the Seljuk Sultan of Rum, and subsequently of Leo, the Prince of Cilician Armenia. That Isaac was seeking aid from these princes in a bid to take the Byzantine throne by force is highly likely. Such a coalition did not materialise, but Isaac seems to have retained strong support in Constantinople. In 1132 John had to return from campaign in haste, when news reached him that conspirators in Constantinople had made an appeal to Isaac to become their ruler. The triumph that John celebrated following his capture of Kastamuni in 1133 can be seen as being a public affirmation of John's legitimacy as emperor embodied in the celebration of the defeat of external foes. The brothers were briefly reconciled in 1138, and Isaac returned to Constantinople; however, a year later Isaac was exiled to Heraclea Pontica, where he remained for the rest of John's life. In the extensive artwork that Isaac commissioned, he made much of his porphyrogenete status and his relationship with his imperial father, Alexios I, but he made little or no reference to his relationship to his brother John, or to the title of \"sebastokrator\" that he had received from him.\nDiplomacy.\nThe central tenet of the foreign policy of John II in the West was to maintain an alliance with the German emperors (Holy Roman Empire). This was necessary to limit the threat posed by the Normans of southern Italy to Byzantine territory in the Balkans. This threat became especially acute after Roger II of Sicily made himself supreme in southern Italy and assumed the title of king. Emperor Lothair III had Byzantine backing, including a large financial subsidy, for his invasion of Norman territory in 1136, which reached as far south as Bari. Pope Innocent II, with the Church's possessions in Italy under threat by Roger II, who supported Antipope Anacletus II, was also party to the alliance of Lothair and John II. However, this alliance proved unable to resist Roger, who extracted by force a recognition of his royal title from the Pope in 1139 (Treaty of Mignano). Lothair's successor Conrad III was approached in 1140 for a royal German bride for John's youngest son Manuel. Bertha of Sulzbach, Conrad's sister-in-law, was chosen and despatched to Byzantium. At much the same time Roger II applied to John II for an imperial bride for his son, but was unsuccessful.\nJohn's penchant for interfering with his wife's family, the rulers of Hungary, was problematic. The welcome accorded to ousted claimants of the Hungarian throne in Constantinople was seen by the Byzantines as a useful insurance policy and source of political leverage. However, the Hungarians treated this interference as a fighting matter. A Hungarian alliance with the Serbs produced serious consequences for continued Byzantine dominance in the western Balkans.\nIn the East John attempted, like his father, to exploit the differences between the Seljuq Sultan of Iconium and the Danishmendid dynasty controlling the northeastern, inland, parts of Anatolia. In 1134 the Seljuq sultan Masoud provided troops for John's attack on the Danishmend-held city of Kastamuni (reoccupied immediately after the Byzantine conquest of 1133), however, the alliance proved unreliable as the Seljuq troops abandoned the expedition, decamping during the night.\nIn the Crusader states of the Levant it was generally admitted that the Byzantine claims over Antioch were legally valid, though it was pragmatically viewed that only when the Byzantine emperor was in a position to enforce them militarily were they likely to be recognised in practice. The high point of John's diplomacy in the Levant was in 1137 when he extracted formal homage from the rulers of the Principality of Antioch, County of Edessa and the County of Tripoli. The Byzantine desire to be seen as holding a level of suzerainty over all of the Crusader states was taken seriously, as evidenced by the alarm shown in the Kingdom of Jerusalem when John informed King Fulk of his plan for an armed pilgrimage to the Holy City (1142).\nReligious matters.\nThe reign of John II was taken up with almost constant warfare and, unlike his father who delighted in active participation in theological and doctrinal disputes, John appears to have been content to leave ecclesiastical matters to the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople and the church hierarchy. Only when religion impinged directly on imperial policy, as in relations with the papacy and the possible union of the Greek and Latin churches, did John take an active part. He organised a number of disputations between Greek and Latin theologians.\nJohn, alongside his wife who shared in his religious and charitable works, is known to have undertaken church building on a considerable scale, including construction of the Monastery of Christ Pantokrator (Zeyrek Mosque) in Constantinople. This monastery, with its three churches, has been described as one of the most important and influential architectural constructions of Middle Byzantine Constantinople. Attached to the monastery was a hospital, of 5 wards, open to people of all social classes. The hospital was staffed by trained layman doctors rather than monks. The central of the three churches was the Komnenian funerary chapel, dedicated to St. Michael. It had twin domes, and is described in the \"typikon\" of the monastery as being in the form of a \"heroon\"; this emulates the older mausolea of Constantine and Justinian in the Church of the Holy Apostles.\nVery active persecution of the followers of the Paulician and Bogomil heresies characterised the last few years of the reign of Alexios I. No records from the reign of John mention such persecution, though countermeasures against heresy by the Byzantine Church remained in force. A permanent synod in Constantinople investigated the writings of a deceased monk named Constantine Chrysomallos which had been circulating in certain monasteries. These works were ordered to be burnt by the Patriarch of Constantinople, Leo Styppes, in May 1140, on the grounds that they incorporated elements of Bogomil belief and practices.\nOne of the few members of the imperial family to be placed in an important position by John was his cousin, Adrian Komnenos (son of John's uncle the \"sebastokrator\" Isaac). Adrian had become a monk, adopting the monastic name John, and had accompanied the emperor on his campaigns of 1138. Soon afterwards, Adrian was appointed Archbishop of Bulgaria as John IV of Ohrid. Bulgaria was an autocephalous see and required a prestigious man as archbishop.\nMilitary exploits.\nThough he fought a number of notable pitched battles, the military strategy of John II relied on taking and holding fortified settlements in order to construct defensible frontiers. John personally conducted approximately twenty five sieges during his reign.\nThe Pechenegs destroyed (1122).\nIn 1119\u20131121 John defeated the Seljuq Turks, establishing his control over southwestern Anatolia. However, immediately afterwards, in 1122, John quickly transferred his troops to Europe to counter a Pecheneg invasion across the Danube frontier into Paristrion. These invaders had been auxiliaries of Vladimir Monomakh, the Prince of Kiev. John surrounded the Pechenegs as they burst into Thrace, tricked them into believing that he would grant them a favourable treaty, and then launched a devastating surprise attack upon their fortified camp. The ensuing Battle of Beroia was hard-fought, John was wounded in the leg by an arrow, but by the end of the day the Byzantine army had won a crushing victory. The decisive moment of the battle was when John led the Varangian Guard, largely composed of Englishmen, to assault defensive Pecheneg wagon laager, employing their famous axes to hack their way in. The battle put an effective end to the Pechenegs as an independent people; many of the captives taken in the conflict were settled as soldier-farmers within the Byzantine frontier.\nConflict with Venice (1124\u20131126).\nAfter his accession, John\u00a0II had refused to confirm his father's 1082 treaty with the Republic of Venice, which had given the Italian republic unique and generous trading rights within the Byzantine Empire. Yet the change in policy was not motivated by financial concerns. An incident involving the abuse of a member of the imperial family by Venetians led to a dangerous conflict, especially as Byzantium had depended on Venice for its naval strength. After a Byzantine retaliatory attack on Kerkyra, John exiled the Venetian merchants from Constantinople. But this produced further retaliation, and a Venetian fleet of 72 ships plundered Rhodes, Chios, Samos, Lesbos, Andros and captured Kefalonia in the Ionian Sea. Eventually John was forced to come to terms; the war was costing him more than it was worth, and he was not prepared to transfer funds from the imperial land forces to the navy for the construction of new ships. John re-confirmed the treaty of 1082, in August 1126.\nWar with the Hungarians and Serbs (1127\u20131129 \u2013 chronology uncertain).\nJohn's marriage to the Hungarian princess Piroska involved him in the dynastic struggles of the Kingdom of Hungary. In giving asylum to \u00c1lmos, a blinded claimant to the Hungarian throne, John aroused the suspicion of the Hungarians. The Hungarians, led by Stephen II, then invaded Byzantium's Balkan provinces in 1127, with hostilities lasting until 1129; however, an alternative chronology has been suggested with the Hungarian attack and Byzantine retaliation taking place in 1125 with a renewal of hostilities in 1126. John launched a punitive raid against the Serbs, who had dangerously aligned themselves with Hungary, many of whom were rounded up and transported to Nicomedia in Asia Minor to serve as military colonists. This was done partly to cow the Serbs into submission (Serbia was, at least nominally, a Byzantine protectorate), and partly to strengthen the Byzantine frontier in the east against the Turks. The Serbs were forced to acknowledge Byzantine suzerainty once again. The Serbian campaign may have taken place between two distinct phases in the war against Hungary. The Hungarians attacked Belgrade, Nish and Sofia; John, who was near Philippopolis in Thrace, counterattacked, supported by a naval flotilla operating on the Danube. After a challenging campaign, the details of which are obscure, the emperor managed to defeat the Hungarians and their Serbian allies at the fortress of Haram or Chramon, which is the modern Nova Palanka; many Hungarian troops were killed when a bridge they were crossing collapsed as they were fleeing from a Byzantine attack. Following this the Hungarians renewed hostilities by attacking Brani\u010devo, which was immediately rebuilt by John. Further Byzantine military successes, Choniates mentions several engagements, resulted in a restoration of peace. The Byzantines were confirmed in their control of Brani\u010devo, Belgrade and Zemun and they also recovered the region of Sirmium (called Frangochorion in Choniates), which had been Hungarian since the 1060s. The Hungarian pretender \u00c1lmos died in 1129, removing the major source of friction.\nWar of attrition against the Anatolian Turks (1119\u201320, 1130\u201335, 1139\u201340).\nEarly in John's reign the Turks were pressing forward against the Byzantine frontier in western Asia Minor. In 1119, the Seljuqs had cut the land route to the city of Attaleia on the southern coast of Anatolia. John\u00a0II and Axouch the Grand Domestic besieged and recaptured Laodicea in 1119 and took Sozopolis by storm in 1120, re-opening land communication with Attaleia. This route was especially important as it also led to Cilicia and the Crusader states of Syria.\nFollowing the end of hostilities with Hungary, John was able to concentrate on Asia Minor during most of his remaining years. He undertook annual campaigns against the Danishmendid emirate in Malatya (Melitene) on the upper Euphrates from 1130 to 1135. Thanks to his energetic campaigning, Turkish attempts at expansion in Asia Minor were halted, and John prepared to take the fight to the enemy. In order to restore the region to Byzantine control, he led a series of well planned and executed campaigns against the Turks, one of which resulted in the reconquest of the ancestral home of the Komnenoi at Kastamonu (Kastra Komnenon); he then left a garrison of 2,000 men at Gangra. John quickly earned a formidable reputation as a wall-breaker, taking one stronghold after another from his enemies. Regions that had been lost to the empire since the Battle of Manzikert were recovered and garrisoned. Yet resistance, particularly from the Danishmends of the northeast, was strong, and the difficult nature of holding the new conquests is illustrated by the fact that Kastamonu was recaptured by the Turks even as John was in Constantinople celebrating its return to Byzantine rule. John persevered, however, and Kastamonu soon changed hands once more.\nIn the spring of 1139, the emperor campaigned with success against Turks, probably nomadic Turkomans, who were raiding the regions along the Sangarios River, striking their means of subsistence by driving off their herds. He then marched for the final time against the Danishmend Turks, his army proceeding along the southern coast of the Black Sea through Bithynia and Paphlagonia. The breakaway Byzantine regime of Constantine Gabras in Trebizond was ended, and the region of Chaldia brought back under direct imperial control. John then besieged but failed to take the city of Neocaesarea, in 1140. The Byzantines were defeated by the conditions rather than by the Turks: the weather was very bad, large numbers of the army's horses died, and provisions became scarce.\nCampaigning in Cilicia and Syria (1137\u20131138).\nIn the Levant, the emperor sought to reinforce Byzantine claims to suzerainty over the Crusader States and to assert his rights over Antioch. In 1137 he conquered Tarsus, Adana, and Mopsuestia from the Principality of Armenian Cilicia, and in 1138 Prince Levon\u00a0I of Armenia and most of his family were brought as captives to Constantinople. This opened the route to the Principality of Antioch, where Raymond of Poitiers, Prince of Antioch, and Joscelin II, Count of Edessa, recognized themselves as vassals of the emperor in 1137. Even Raymond II, the Count of Tripoli, hastened northwards to pay homage to John, repeating the homage that his predecessor had given John's father in 1109. There then followed a joint campaign as John led the armies of Byzantium, Antioch, and Edessa against Muslim Syria. Aleppo proved too strong to attack during an attempted siege, but the fortresses of Balat, Biza'a, Athareb, Maarat al-Numan, and Kafartab were taken by assault.\nAlthough John fought hard for the Christian cause in the campaign in Syria, his allies, Prince Raymond of Antioch and Count Joscelin\u00a0II of Edessa, remained in their camp playing dice and feasting instead of helping to press the siege of the city of Shaizar. The Crusader Princes were suspicious of each other and of John, and neither wanted the other to gain from participating in the campaign. Raymond also wanted to hold on to Antioch, which he had agreed to hand over to John if the campaign was successful in capturing Aleppo, Shaizar, Homs, and Hama. Latin and Muslim sources describe John's energy and personal courage in prosecuting the siege. The city was taken, but the citadel defied assault. The Emir of Shaizar offered to pay a large indemnity, become John's vassal, and pay yearly tribute. John had lost all confidence in his allies, and a Muslim army under Zengi was approaching to try to relieve the city, therefore the emperor reluctantly accepted the offer. The emperor was distracted by a Seljuq raid on Cilicia and developments in the west, where he was pursuing a German alliance directed against the threat posed by the Normans of Sicily. Joscelin and Raymond conspired to delay the promised handover of Antioch's citadel to the emperor, stirring up popular unrest in the city directed at John and the local Greek community. John had little choice but to leave Syria with his ambitions only partially realised.\nFinal campaigns (1142).\nIn early 1142 John campaigned against the Seljuqs of Iconium to secure his lines of communication through Attalia (Antalya). During this campaign his eldest son and co-emperor Alexios died of a fever. Having secured his route, John embarked on a new expedition into Syria determined to reduce Antioch to direct imperial rule. This expedition included a planned pilgrimage to Jerusalem on which he intended to take his army. King Fulk of Jerusalem, fearing that the emperor's presence with overwhelming military force would constrain him to make an act of homage and formally recognise Byzantine suzerainty over his kingdom, begged the emperor to bring only a modest escort. Fulk cited the inability of his largely barren kingdom to support the passage of a substantial army. This lukewarm response resulted in John\u00a0II deciding to postpone his pilgrimage. John descended rapidly on northern Syria, forcing Joscelin II of Edessa to render hostages, including his daughter, as a guarantee of his good behaviour. He then advanced on Antioch demanding that the city and its citadel be surrendered to him. Raymond of Poitiers played for time, putting the proposal to the vote of the Antiochene general assembly. With the season well advanced John decided to take his army into winter quarters in Cilicia, proposing to renew his attack on Antioch the following year.\nDeath and succession.\nHaving prepared his army for a renewed attack on Antioch, John amused himself by hunting wild boar on Mount Taurus in Cilicia, where he accidentally cut himself on the hand with a poisoned arrow. John initially ignored the wound and it became infected. He died a number of days after the accident, on 8 April 1143, probably of septicaemia. It has been suggested that John was assassinated by a conspiracy within the units of his army of Latin origins who were unhappy at fighting their co-religionists of Antioch, and who wanted to place his pro-western son Manuel on the throne. However, there is very little overt support for this hypothesis in the primary sources.\nJohn's final action as emperor was to choose Manuel, the younger of his surviving sons, to be his successor. John is recorded as citing two main reasons for choosing Manuel over his older brother Isaac: Isaac's irascibility, and the courage that Manuel had shown on campaign at Neocaesarea. Another theory alleges that the reason for this choice was the AIMA prophecy, which foretold that John's successor should be one whose name began with an \"M\". Fittingly, John's close friend John Axouch, although he is recorded as having tried hard to persuade the dying emperor that Isaac was the better candidate to succeed, was instrumental in ensuring that Manuel's assumption of power was free from any overt opposition.\nLegacy.\nHistorian John Birkenmeier argued that John's reign was the most successful of the Komnenian period. In \"The Development of the Komnenian Army 1081\u20131180,\" he stresses the wisdom of John's approach to warfare, which focused on sieges rather than risking pitched battles. Birkenmeier argues that John's strategy of launching annual campaigns with limited, realistic objectives was a more sensible one than that followed by his son Manuel\u00a0I. According to this view, John's campaigns benefited the Byzantine Empire because they protected the empire's heartland, which lacked reliable borders, while gradually extending its territory in Asia Minor. The Turks were forced onto the defensive, while John kept his diplomatic situation relatively simple by allying with the Holy Roman Emperor against the Normans of Sicily.\nOverall, it is clear that John II Komnenos left the empire a great deal better off than he had found it. By the time of his death substantial territories had been recovered, and the goals of the recovery of control over central Anatolia and the re-establishment of a frontier on the Euphrates seemed achievable. However some Greeks of the interior of Anatolia were becoming increasingly accustomed to Turkish rule and often found it preferable to that of Byzantium, as seen in the Battle of Lake Pousgouse. Also, though it was relatively easy to extract submission and admissions of vassalage from the Anatolian Turks, Serbs and Crusader States of the Levant, converting these relationships into concrete gains for the security of the Empire had proven elusive. These problems were left for his gifted and mercurial son, Manuel, to attempt to solve.\nFamily.\nJohn\u00a0II Komnenos married Princess Piroska of Hungary (renamed Irene), a daughter of King Ladislaus\u00a0I of Hungary in 1104; the marriage was intended as compensation for the loss of some territories to King Coloman of Hungary. She played little part in government, devoting herself to piety and their large brood of children. Irene died on 13 August 1134, and was later venerated as Saint Irene. John\u00a0II and Irene had 8 children:\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is bounded in the north by South China, in the west by the Indochinese Peninsula, in the east by the islands of Taiwan and northwestern Philippines (mainly Luzon, Mindoro, and Palawan), and in the south by Borneo, eastern Sumatra, and the Bangka Belitung Islands, encompassing an area of around . It communicates with the East China Sea via the Taiwan Strait, the Philippine Sea via the Luzon Strait, the Sulu Sea via the straits around Palawan, the Java Sea via the Karimata and Bangka Straits, and directly with the Gulf of Thailand. Additionally, the Gulf of Tonkin is part of the South China Sea. \n$3.4 trillion of the world's $16 trillion maritime shipping passed through the South China Sea in 2016. Oil and natural gas reserves have been found in the area. The Western Central Pacific accounted for 14% of the world's commercial fishing in 2010.\nThe South China Sea Islands, collectively comprising several archipelago clusters of mostly small uninhabited islands, islets (cays and shoals), reefs/atolls, and seamounts numbering in the hundreds, are subject to competing claims of sovereignty by several countries. These claims are also reflected in the variety of names used for the islands and the sea.\nEtymology.\n\"South China Sea\" is the dominant term used in English for the sea, and the name is equivalent in almost all European languages. This name is a result of early European interest in the sea as a route from Europe and South Asia to the trading opportunities of China. In the 16th century, Portuguese sailors referred to it as the China Sea (); later, the need to differentiate it from nearby bodies of water led to its renaming to the South China Sea. The International Hydrographic Organization refers to the sea as \"South China Sea (Nan Hai)\".\nThe \"Yi Zhou Shu\", which was a chronicle of the Western Zhou dynasty (1046\u2013771 BCE), gives the first Chinese name for the South China Sea as \"Nanfang Hai\" (), claiming that barbarians from that sea gave tributes of hawksbill sea turtles to the Zhou rulers. The \"Classic of Poetry\", \"Zuo Zhuan\", and \"Guoyu\" classics of the Spring and Autumn period (771\u2013476 BCE) also referred to the sea, but by the name \"Nan Hai\" () in reference to the State of Chu's expeditions there. Nan Hai, the South Sea, was one of the Four Seas of Chinese literature. There are three other seas, one for each of the four cardinal directions. During the Eastern Han dynasty (23\u2013220 CE), China's rulers called the sea \"Zhang Hai\" (). \"Fei Hai\" () became popular during the Southern and Northern dynasties. Usage of the current Chinese name, \"Nan Hai\" (South Sea), gradually became widespread during the Qing dynasty.\nIn Southeast Asia, it was once called the Champa Sea or \"Sea of Cham\", after the maritime kingdom of Champa (nowadays Central Vietnam), which flourished there before the 16th century. The majority of the sea came under Japanese naval control during World War II, following the military acquisition of many surrounding South East Asian territories in 1941. Japan calls the sea \"South China Sea\". This was written until 2004, when the Japanese Foreign Ministry and other departments switched the spelling to , which has become the standard usage in Japan. \nIn China, it is referred to as the \"South Sea\", (), and in Vietnam the \"East Sea\", . In Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines, it was long known as the \"South China Sea\" (, ), with the part within Philippine territorial waters often called the \"Luzon Sea\", , by the Philippines.\nHowever, following an escalation of the Spratly Islands dispute in 2011, various Philippine government agencies started using the name West Philippine Sea. A Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) spokesperson stated that the sea to the east of the Philippines will continue to be called the Philippine Sea. In September 2012, Philippine President Benigno Aquino III signed Administrative Order No. 29, mandating that all government agencies use the name \"West Philippine Sea\" to refer to the parts of South China Sea within the Philippines exclusive economic zone, including the Luzon Sea as well as the waters around, within and adjacent to the Kalayaan Island Group and Bajo de Masinloc, and tasked the National Mapping and Resource Information Authority to use the name in official maps.\nIn July 2017, to assert its sovereignty, Indonesia renamed the northern reaches of its exclusive economic zone in the South China Sea as the \"North Natuna Sea\", which is located north of the Indonesian Natuna Islands, and borders the southern Vietnam exclusive economic zone, corresponding to the southern end of the South China Sea. The Natuna Sea is located south of Natuna Island within Indonesian territorial waters. Therefore, Indonesia has named two seas that are portions of the South China Sea: the Natuna Sea, located between the Natuna Islands and the Lingga and Tambelan Archipelagos, and the North Natuna Sea, located between the Natuna Islands and Cape C\u00e0 Mau on the southern tip of the Mekong Delta in Vietnam. There has been no agreement between China and Indonesia regarding the so-called the Natuna waters dispute, with China remaining ambiguous about the southern limit of its area of interest.\nHydrography.\nStates and territories with borders on the sea (clockwise from north) include: the People's Republic of China, the Republic of China (Taiwan), the Philippines, Malaysia, Brunei, Indonesia, and Vietnam. Major rivers that flow into the South China Sea include the Pearl, Min, Jiulong, Red, Mekong, Menam, Rajang, Baram, Kapuas, Batang Hari, Musi, Kampar, Indragiri, Pahang, Agno, Pampanga, and Pasig Rivers.\nThe IHO in its \"Limits of Oceans and Seas\", 3rd edition (1953), defines the limits of the South China Sea as follows:\n\"On the South.\" The Eastern and Southern limits of Singapore and Malacca Straits [A line joining Tanjong Datok, the Southeast point of Johore () through Horsburgh Reef to Pulo Koko, the Northeastern extreme of Bintan Island (). The Northeastern coast of Sumatra] as far West as Tanjong Kedabu () down the East coast of Sumatra to Lucipara Point () thence to Tanjong Nanka, the Southwest extremity of Banka Island (where it transitions as Java Sea), through this island to Tanjong Berikat the Eastern point (), on to Tanjong Djemang () in Billiton, along the North coast of this island to Tanjong Boeroeng Mandi () and thence a line to Tanjong Sambar () the Southwest extreme of Borneo.\n\"On the East.\" From Tanjong Sambar through the West coast of Borneo to Tanjong Sampanmangio, the North point, thence a line to West points of Balabac and Secam Reefs, on to the West point of Bancalan Island and to Cape Buliluyan, the Southwest point of Palawan, through this island to Cabuli Point, the Northern point thereof, thence to the Northwest point of Busuanga and to Cape Calavite in the island of Mindoro, to the Northwest point of Lubang Island and to Point Fuego (14\u00b008'N) in Luzon Island, through this island to Cape Engano, the Northeast point of Luzon, along a line joining this cape with the East point of Balintang Island (20\u00b0N) and to the East point of Y'Ami Island (21\u00b005'N) thence to Garan Bi, the Southern point of Taiwan (Formosa), through this island to Santyo (25\u00b0N) its North Eastern Point.\n\"On the North.\" From Fuki Kaku, the northern point of Formosa, to Kiushan Tao (Turnabout Island), on to the southern point of Haitan Tao (25\u00b025'N) and thence westward on the parallel of 25\u00b024' North to the coast of Fukien.\n\"On the West.\" The Mainland, the Southern limit of the Gulf of Thailand, and the East coast of the Malay Peninsula.\nHowever, in a revised draft edition of \"Limits of Oceans and Seas\", 4th edition (1986), the International Hydrographic Organization recognized the Natuna Sea. Thus, the southern limit of the South China Sea would be revised from the Bangka Belitung Islands to the Natuna Islands.\nThe South China Sea has an average depth of , and the deepest recorded point is either or .\nGeology.\nThe sea lies above a drowned continental shelf; during recent ice ages, global sea level was hundreds of metres lower, and Borneo was part of the Asian mainland.\nThe South China Sea opened around 45 million years ago when the \"Dangerous Ground\" rifted away from southern China. Extension culminated in seafloor spreading around 30 million years ago, a process that propagated to the southwest, resulting in the V-shaped basin we see today. Extension ceased around 17 million years ago. \nArguments have continued about the role of tectonic extrusion in forming the basin. Paul Tapponnier and colleagues have argued that as India collides with Asia, it pushes Indochina to the southeast. The relative shear between Indochina and China caused the South China Sea to open. This view is disputed by geologists who do not consider Indochina to have moved far relative to mainland Asia. Marine geophysical studies in the Gulf of Tonkin by Peter Clift have shown that the Red River Fault was active and causing basin formation at least by 37 million years ago in the northwest South China Sea, consistent with extrusion playing a part in the formation of the sea. Since opening, the South China Sea has been the repository of large sediment volumes delivered by the Mekong River, Red River, and Pearl River. Several of these deltas are rich in oil and gas deposits.\nIslands and seamounts.\nThe South China Sea contains over 250 small islands, atolls, cays, shoals, reefs, and sandbars, most of which have no indigenous people, many of which are naturally underwater at high tide, and some of which are permanently submerged. The features are:\nThe Spratly Islands span an area of approximately 810 by 900 km, covering around 175 identified insular features, the largest being Taiping Island (Itu Aba) at just over long and with its highest elevation at .\nThe largest singular feature in the area of the Spratly Islands is a wide seamount called Reed Tablemount, also known as Reed Bank, in the northeast of the group, separated from Palawan Island of the Philippines by the Palawan Trench. Now completely submerged, with a depth of , it was an island until it was covered approximately 7,000 years ago by increasing sea levels after the last ice age. With an area of , it is one of the largest submerged atoll structures in the world.\nTrade route.\nThe South China Sea has historically been an important trade route between northeast Asia, China, southeast Asia, and going to India and the West. The number of shipwrecks of trading ships that lie on the ocean's floor attests to a thriving trade going back centuries. Nine historic trade ships carrying ceramics dating back to the 10th century until the 19th century were excavated under Swedish engineer Sten Sj\u00f6strand.\nOf the world's $16 trillion maritime shipping, $3.4 trillion passed through the South China Sea in 2016. The 2019 data showed that the sea carries trade equivalent to 5 percent of global GDP.\nNatural resources.\nIn 2012\u20132013, the United States Energy Information Administration estimated that there is relatively little oil and natural gas in contested areas such as the Paracel and the Spratly Islands. Most of the proved or probable 11 billion barrels of oil and 190 trillion cubic feet of natural gas in the South China Sea exist near undisputed shorelines.\nIn 2010, the Western Central Pacific (excluding the northernmost reaches of the South China Sea closest to the PRC coast) accounted for 14% of the total world catch from commercial fishing of 11.7 million tonnes. This was up from less than 4 million tonnes in 1970.\nChina announced in May 2017 a breakthrough for mining methane clathrates, when they extracted methane from hydrates in the South China Sea, but commercial adoption may take a decade or more.\nTerritorial claims.\nSeveral countries have made competing territorial claims over the South China Sea. Such disputes have been regarded as some of Asia's potentially most dangerous points of conflict.\nBoth the People's Republic of China (PRC) and the Republic of China (ROC, commonly known as Taiwan) claim almost the entire body as their own, demarcating their claims within what is known as the \"nine-dash line\", which claims overlap with virtually every other country in the region. Competing claims include:\nChina and Vietnam have both been vigorous in prosecuting their claims. China (various governments) and South Vietnam each controlled part of the Paracel Islands before 1974. A brief conflict in 1974 resulted in 18 Chinese and 53 Vietnamese deaths, and China has controlled the whole of the Paracel since then. The Spratly Islands have been the site of a naval clash, in which over 70 Vietnamese sailors were killed just south of Chigua Reef in March 1988. Disputing claimants regularly report clashes between naval vessels, and these now also include airspace incidents.\nASEAN, in general, and Malaysia, in particular, have been keen to ensure that the territorial disputes within the South China Sea do not escalate into armed conflict. As such, joint development authorities have been established in areas of overlapping claims to jointly develop the area and divide the profits equally without settling the issue of sovereignty over the area. This is true particularly in the Gulf of Thailand. Generally, China has preferred to resolve competing claims bilaterally, while some ASEAN countries prefer multilateral talks, believing that they are disadvantaged in bilateral negotiations with the much larger China and that, because many countries claim the same territory, only multilateral talks could effectively resolve the competing claims.\nThe overlapping claims over Pedra Branca or Pulau Batu Putih, including the neighbouring Middle Rocks, by both Singapore and Malaysia were settled in 2008 by the International Court of Justice, awarding Pedra Branca/Pulau Batu Puteh to Singapore and the Middle Rocks to Malaysia. In July 2010, US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton called for China to resolve the territorial dispute. China responded by demanding that the US keep out of the issue. This came at a time when both countries had been engaging in naval exercises as a show of force to the opposing side, which increased tensions in the region. The US Department of Defense released a statement on August 18 where it opposed the use of force to resolve the dispute, and accused China of assertive behaviour. On July 22, 2011, one of India's amphibious assault vessels, the INS \"Airavat\" which was on a friendly visit to Vietnam, was reportedly contacted at a distance of from the Vietnamese coast in the disputed South China Sea on an open radio channel by a vessel identifying itself as the Chinese Navy and stating that the ship was entering Chinese waters. The spokesperson for the Indian Navy clarified that, as no ship or aircraft was visible from INS \"Airavat,\" it proceeded as scheduled on its onward journey. The Indian Navy further clarified that \"[t]here was no confrontation involving the INS Airavat. India supports freedom of navigation in international waters, including in the South China Sea, and the right of passage in accordance with accepted principles of international law. These principles should be respected by all.\"\nIn September 2011, shortly after China and Vietnam had signed an agreement seeking to contain a dispute over the South China Sea, India's state-run explorer, Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) said that its overseas investment arm ONGC Videsh Limited had signed a three-year deal with Petrovietnam for developing long-term cooperation in the oil sector and that it had accepted Vietnam's offer of exploration in certain specified blocks in the South China Sea. In response, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Jiang Yu issued a protest. The spokesman of the Ministry of External Affairs of the Government of India responded by saying that \"The Chinese had concerns, but we are going by what the Vietnamese authorities have told us and have conveyed this to the Chinese.\" The Indo-Vietnamese deal was also denounced by the Chinese state-run newspaper \"Global Times\".\nIn 1999, Taiwan claimed the entirety of the South China Sea islands under the administration of Lee Teng-hui. The entire subsoil, seabed, and waters of the Paracels and Spratlys are claimed by Taiwan.\nIn 2012 and 2013, Vietnam and Taiwan butted heads against each other over anti-Vietnamese military exercises by Taiwan.\nIn May 2014, China established an oil rig near the Paracel Islands, leading to multiple incidents between Vietnamese and Chinese ships. Vietnamese analysis identifies this change in strategy, generating ongoing incidents as occurring since 2012.\nIn December 2018, retired Chinese admiral Luo Yuan proposed that a possible solution to tensions with the United States in the South China Sea would be to sink one or two United States Navy aircraft carriers to break US morale. Also in December 2018, Chinese commentator and Senior Colonel in the People's Liberation Army Air Force, Dai Xu, suggested that China's navy should ram United States Navy ships sailing in the South China Sea.\nThe US, although not a signatory to UNCLOS, has maintained its position that its naval vessels have consistently sailed unhindered through the South China Sea and will continue to do so. At times, US warships have come within the 12 nautical-mile limit of Chinese-controlled islands (such as the Paracel Islands), arousing China's ire. During the US Chief of Naval Operations' visit to China in early 2019, he and his Chinese counterpart worked out rules of engagement, whenever American warships and Chinese warships encounter on the high seas.\nOn 26 June 2020, the 36th Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Summit was held virtually. Vietnam, as the Chairman of the Summit, released the Chairman's Statement. The statement said the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea is \"the basis for determining maritime entitlements, sovereign rights, jurisdiction and legitimate interests over maritime zones, and the 1982 UNCLOS sets out the legal framework within which all activities in the oceans and seas must be carried out.\"\nIn November 2025, Australia raised concerns over China\u2019s military expansion in the South and East China Seas, citing increased risks to trade routes. The remarks followed an incident in which a Chinese fighter jet dropped flares near an Australian patrol plane, deemed \u201cunsafe and unprofessional,\u201d and were made during the Indo-Pacific Navy Conference amid Australia\u2019s AUKUS nuclear submarine program.\n2016 arbitration.\nIn January 2013, the Philippines initiated arbitration proceedings against China (PRC) over issues surrounding the nine-dash line, characterization of maritime features, and EEZ. China did not participate in the arbitration.127\nOn 12 July 2016, an arbitral tribunal ruled in favor of the Philippines on most of its submissions. It clarified that it would not \"rule on any question of sovereignty over land territory and would not delimit any maritime boundary between the Parties\" but concluded that China had not historically exercised exclusive control within the nine-dash line, hence has \"no legal basis\" to claim \"historic rights\" over the resources. It also concluded that China's historic rights claims over the maritime areas (as opposed to land masses and territorial waters) inside the nine-dash line would have no lawful effect outside of what is entitled to under UNCLOS. It criticized China's land reclamation projects and its construction of artificial islands in the Spratly Islands, stating that it had caused \"severe harm to the coral reef environment.\" Finally, it characterized Taiping Island and other features of the Spratly Islands as \"rocks\" under UNCLOS, and therefore are not entitled to a 200 nautical mile exclusive economic zone. The arbitral tribunal decision was ruled as final and non-appealable by either country. \nChina rejected the ruling, calling it \"ill-founded\". China's response was to ignore the arbitration result and to continue pursuing bilateral discussions with the Philippines.128\nTaiwan, which currently administers Taiping Island, the largest of the Spratly Islands, also rejected the ruling. As of November 2023[ [update]], 26 governments support the ruling, 17 issued generally positive statements noting the ruling but not calling for compliance, and eight rejected it. The governments in support are Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, India, Ireland, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, New Zealand, the Philippines, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, the United Kingdom, and the United States; the governments in opposition are China, Montenegro, Pakistan, Russia, Sudan, Syria, Taiwan, and Vanuatu. The United Nations itself does not have a position on the legal and procedural merits of the case or on the disputed claims, and the Secretary-General expressed his hope that the continued consultations on a Code of Conduct between ASEAN and China under the framework of the Declaration of the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea will lead to increased mutual understanding among all the parties.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He was the second emperor of the Amorian dynasty and the last emperor to support iconoclasm.\nTheophilos was well-educated in the imperial household. Upon his accession to the throne he faced the dual threat of the Abbasid Caliphate in Asia Minor and the Aghlabids in Sicily, and personally led armies against both foes from 831 onwards. He won fleeting victories but the retaliation of Caliph al-Mu'tasim (r.\u2009833\u00a0\u2013\u00a0842) was devastating, as was most humiliating in the Sack of Amorion in 838, the ancestral home of Theophilos' Amorian dynasty. Internal strife within the Caliphate allowed the Byzantines to recover. Theophilos engaged in many construction and renovation projects. One of his closest allies was the learned and cosmopolitan John the Grammarian, and they both improved relations with the Caliph and appreciated Arabic culture. He also secured nominal overlordship over the Principality of Serbia, uniting against their common enemy, the First Bulgarian Empire.\nThe military defeats to the Arabs inspired a more intensely iconoclastic policy than what Theophilos inherited from his father Michael II, and he persecuted many clerics for refusing to submit to the imperial will. After his death, his wife Theodora rescinded this policy but also defended his broader reputation. Accordingly the historical record preserves a picture of Theophilos as a just ruler and keen constructor and administrator, alongside rebukes of his iconoclasm.\nBiography.\nEarly life.\nTheophilos was born in late 812 or early 813, the son of Emperor Michael II and his wife Thekla, and the godson of Emperor Leo V the Armenian. Michael II crowned Theophilos co-emperor in 821. The date is almost universally given as 12 May 821 (Whitsunday), although this is not really corroborated by any source (another possible date is 24 March, Easter). Unlike his father, Theophilos received an extensive education from John Hylilas, the grammarian, and was a great admirer of music and art.\nAccession to the throne.\nOn 2 October 829, Theophilos succeeded his father as sole emperor. Theophilos continued in his predecessors' iconoclasm, though without his father's more conciliatory tone, issuing an edict in 832 forbidding the veneration of icons. He also saw himself as the champion of justice, which he served most ostentatiously by executing his father's co-conspirators against Leo V immediately after his accession.\nCampaigns against the Arabs.\nAt the time of his accession, Theophilos was obliged to wage wars against the Arabs on two fronts. Sicily was once again invaded by the Arabs, who took Palermo after a year-long siege in 831, established the Emirate of Sicily, and gradually continued to expand across the island. In 830, Abbasid Caliph al-Ma'mun (r.\u2009813\u00a0\u2013\u00a0833) invaded Cappadocia in response to Theophilos' attack on Mopsuestia and Tarsos, capturing the city of Tyana. He launched a second campaign in 831 and then a third in 832, in which he captured the major border fortress of Loulon, but in 833 failed to seize Amorion. Another defeat in Cappadocia forced Theophilos to sue for peace (a one-off tribute of 100,000 gold dinars and the return of 7,000 prisoners), which he secured the next year, after the death of al-Ma'mun in 833. He was succeeded by his brother al-Mu'tasim (r.\u2009833\u00a0\u2013\u00a0842) who abandoned Tyana.\nDuring the respite from the war against the Abbasids, Theophilos arranged for the abduction of the Byzantine captives settled north of the Danube by Krum of Bulgaria. The rescue operation was carried out with success in c. 836, and the peace between Bulgaria and the Byzantine Empire was quickly restored. However, it proved impossible to maintain peace in the East. In 834 Theophilos had given asylum to a number of refugees from the east; one of the group was Nasr, a Persian who was baptized, changed his name to Theophobos, married the Emperor's aunt Irene and became one of his generals. As relations with the Abbasids deteriorated, Theophilos prepared for a new war.\nIn 837, Theophilos led a vast army of 70,000 men towards Mesopotamia and captured Melitene, Arsamosata and Samosata. The Emperor also took and destroyed Sozopetra, which some sources claim as the birthplace of Caliph al-Mu'tasim. Theophilos returned to Constantinople in triumph. Eager for revenge, al-Mu'tasim assembled a vast army and launched a three-pronged invasion of Anatolia in 838. Theophilos decided to strike one division of the caliph's army before they could combine. On 21 July 838, at the Battle of Anzen in Dazimon, Theophilos personally led a Byzantine army of 25,000 to 40,000 men against the troops commanded by al-Afshin. Afshin withstood the Byzantine attack, counter-attacked, and won the battle. The Byzantine survivors fell back in disorder and did not interfere in the Caliph's continuing campaign.\nAl-Mu'tasim took Ancyra, and al-Afshin joined him there. The full Abbasid army advanced against Amorion, the ancestral home of the dynasty. Initially there was determined resistance. Then a Muslim captive escaped and informed the caliph where there was a section of the wall that had only a front fa\u00e7ade. Al-Mu'tasim concentrated his bombardment on this section, and the wall was breached. Having heroically held for fifty-five days, the city fell to al-Mu'tasim on 12 or 15 August 838. Although the Caliph was soon forced to retreat to Abbasid territory to suppress an insurgency, the defeat was a major blow to Theophilos' resources and prestige, and numerous Byzantine prisoners were executed. The weakness of the Byzantine military was exposed, in particular by elite Turkish archers that the Caliph had recruited.\nAround 841, the Republic of Venice sent a fleet of 60 galleys (each carrying 200 men) to assist the Byzantines in driving the Arabs from Crotone, but it failed. During the campaign al-Mu'tasim discovered that some of his top generals were plotting against him. Many of these leading commanders were arrested and some executed before he arrived home. Al-Afshin seems not to have been involved in this, but he was detected in other intrigues and died in prison in the spring of 841. Al-Mu'tasim concluded a peace with Theophilos in 841. He fell sick in October and died on 5 January 842. The Sack of Amorion was the high point of Abbasid incursion past the Taurus Mountains, after which political strife within the Caliphate improved the Byzantine military situation.\nStabilisation.\nDespite major defeats at the hands of the Abbasids, the Byzantines consolidated and gained a degree of economic stability, and was no longer facing an existential threat. Theophilos was a keen builder and administrator; through the construction of lavish palaces and exchange of precious goods and manuscripts, he intended to rival the court at Baghdad, which was itself seeing a revival of Hellenic thought. Even as far as the streets of Guangzhou during the era of the Tang dynasty, the Arab-style kaftan was in fashion. In the tenth century, Liudprand of Cremona reported that Theophilos decorated the reception hall of the Magnaura with a throne and automata of lions and birds. Theophilos also repaired the Walls of Constantinople near the Blachernae district as well as large sections of the sea walls.\nIn 837, John the Grammarian returned from an embassy to Baghdad impressed by the architecture, and persuaded Theophilos to construct an \"Abbasid\"-style palace in Bryas near Chalcedon, which is now in ruins. \"Theophanes Continuatus\" relates John's instructions.[John] persuaded [Theophanes] to build the palace of Bryas in imitation of Arab [palaces] and in no way differing from the latter either in form or decoration. The work was carried out according to John's instructions by a man named Patrikes who happened to be also adorned with the rank of \"patrikios\". The only departure he made [from the Arab model] was that he built next to the bedchamber a church of our most holy lady, the Mother of God, and in the courtyard of the same palace a triconch church of great beauty and exceptional size, the middle part of which was dedicated to the archangel [Michael], while the lateral parts were dedicated to women martyrs.\nThis passage has been interpreted as either a report of cultural receptivity and Theophilos' taste for Islamic motifs or as an iconodule fabrication to depict Theophanes and Patriarch John as Muslim-sympathisers. However the overall account is not particularly polemical.\nTheophilos also restructured and embellished sections of the Hagia Sophia and continued repairs of the urban fabric of Constantinople begun under Constantine V. The Hagia Sophia at Vize, Thrace is dated to his reign, and resembles the Hagia Irene of Constantinople. \"Theophanes Continuatus\" reports his construction of a home for former prostitutes, as well as of monasteries including the Monastery of Gastria and the St. Panteleimon Monastery. In the palatine precinct of the Great Palace of Constantinople, Theophilos constructed buildings sheathed in marble with bronze and silver doors, fountains, a decorated armoury, mosaics, terraces, porticoes and gardens.\nIn 838, in order to impress the Caliph in Baghdad, Theophilus had John the Grammarian distribute 36,000 \"nomismata\" to the citizens. In 839 or 840, he initiated diplomatic contact with the Umayyad Emirate of C\u00f3rdoba. The name of his ambassador is somewhat garbled in the Arabic accounts of Ibn Hayyan, but it seems to have been the admiral Krateros. He was accompanied on his return by the C\u00f3rdoban poet al-Ghazal, who signed a pact of friendship with Theophilos directed against the Abbasids.\nWhen the Abbasids crushed the revolt of Babak Khorramdin in 838, many remaining Khurramite rebels fled to Byzantine territory and were accepted by Theophilos and placed under the command of Theophobos. They were called \"Persians\" by Byzantine chroniclers and proved valuable for the Empire which was experiencing a shortage of experienced soldiers at the time. However, after the Battle of Anzen, some Azerbaijani Khurramites withdrew to Sinope and proclaimed Theophobos emperor. By 840, Theophilos had threatened Theophobos and persuaded him into accepting a pardon. He then redistributed the Khurramite troops throughout the themes as garrison soldiers.\nThe persistent warfare had caused a serious manpower shortage, which Theophilos attempted to remedy by resettling defectors from the Caliphate into Asia Minor, and issuing an edict requiring Roman widows to marry barbarian immigrants, which was reported in the \"Life\" of Athanasia of Aegina. The discoveries of seals of the Byzantine ambassador to the Franks and Venice in Baltic trading settlements suggests that the Byzantines were attempting to recruit Scandinavians, who had recently appeared in the region of the Black Sea, as another means of addressing the manpower shortage.\nIntensification of iconoclastic policies.\nThe capture of Palermo by the Arabs, Theophilos' defeat in Cappadocia in 831 and the discovery of a treasonous plot by iconodules in Constantinople likely pressured the Emperor into enacting an iconoclastic policy that was more severe than that of his father, which Theophilos had maintained from the beginning of his reign. He was supported by John the Grammarian, patriarchal \"synkellos\" (secretary) of Patriarch Antony I of Constantinople. \"Theophanes Continuatus\" reports that Theophilos forbade the painting of religious images and removed existing images, replacing them with secular images (e.g., of birds and animals), on similar grounds expressed in the \"Acts\" of the Council of Constantinople of 815. In 833, he persecuted iconodules who were not in communion with the Patriarch by ordering the seizing of the property of those who helped or sheltered them. However, the letter of Michael II to Carolingian Emperor Louis the Pious establishes that images that were not readily accessible and suspended high up in churches were permitted and commonplace.\nAlong with his severe iconoclastic policy, Theophilos persecuted numerous individuals for political and religious reasons, in a targeted and methodical way, however it does appear that he was more politically than religiously motivated overall. Euthymius of Sardis and Joseph the Confessor were arrested and beaten for distributing or writing pamphlets foretelling the death of the Emperor. Euthymius was elderly and died from his injuries, Joseph was imprisoned and their associate Theophilos of Ephesos was forced into hiding. The pamphlets were considered defamatory and thus treasonous. Nicetas the Patrician, distant relative of Empress Irene and former \"strat\u0113gos\" of Sicily, was banished for refusing to take communion with the Patriarch in 830. The Palestinian monks Theodorus and Theophanes were said to be so defiant that verses describing their crimes were branded on their foreheads. Much of the persecution of iconodules was in effect punishment for challenging imperial authority rather than iconodulia as such. The abbot Methodios was publicly and provocatively opposed to the imperial policy, and was imprisoned and beaten for his disobedience. However perhaps through his connections to the imperial household or his alleged prophetic powers that may have awed Theophilos, Methodios became an associate of the Emperor. Tenth-century sources report that Theophilos' own wife, Theodora and her mother maintained iconodulia, however there is no contemporary evidence of this.\nThe majority of the clergy did not revolt against imperial policy, including Joannicius the Great, who was criticised for his compliance by Theodore the Stoudite, and Ignatios, later Patriarch of Constantinople. Neither did Theophilos oppose all monasteries, although he used some to confine iconodule clerics, as did Emperor Leo V the Armenian.\nDue to the unanimous iconodule sympathies of contemporary sources, it is difficult to determine the existence and extent of a popular iconoclast or iconodule tradition. It is likely that the changes in imperial policy in 787 and 815 only affected a small number of individuals and did not alter the religious practices of the whole population to a great degree. Theophilos' enforcement of iconoclasm may have served as an opportunistic means of asserting imperial authority, rather than a purely theological endeavour, but there is no reason to doubt that he was sincere in his iconoclastic convictions.\nRelations with Bulgaria and Serbia.\nIn 836, following the expiration of the 20-year peace treaty between the Empire and Bulgaria, Theophilos ravaged the Bulgarian frontier. The Bulgarians retaliated, and under the leadership of Isbul they reached Adrianople. At this time, if not earlier, the Bulgarians annexed Philippopolis and its environs. Khan Malamir died in 836.\nThe peace between the Serbs, Byzantine \"foederati\", and the Bulgars lasted until 839. Vlastimir of Serbia united several tribes, and Theophilos granted the Serbs independence; Vlastimir acknowledged nominal overlordship of the Emperor. The annexation of western Macedonia by the Bulgars changed the political situation. Malamir or his successor may have seen a threat in the Serb consolidation and opted to subjugate them in the midst of the conquest of Slav lands. Another cause might have been that the Byzantines wanted to divert attention so that they could cope with the Slavic uprising in the Peloponnese, meaning they sent the Serbs to instigate the war. It is thought that the rapid extension of Bulgars over Slavs prompted the Serbs to unite into a state.\nKhan Presian I (r. 836\u2013852) invaded Serbian territory in 839 (see Bulgarian\u2013Serbian Wars). The invasion led to a three-year war, in which Vlastimir was victorious; Presian was heavily defeated, made no territorial gains, and lost many of his men. The Serbs had a tactical advantage in the hills, and the Bulgars were driven out by the army of Vlastimir. The war ended with the death of Theophilos, which released Vlastimir from his obligations to the Byzantine Empire.\nDeath.\nAs Theophilos' health was gradually failing in 842, he suspected that Theophobos would attempt a coup after his death, so he was invited to stay in the Great Palace of Constantinople. Immediately after Theophilos died on 20 January 842, his leading officers executed Theophobos.\nAssessment and legacy.\nTheophilos was the last iconoclast emperor of the Byzantine Empire, and his strict insistence on the removal of images and banning of the production of icons as reported by later sources represents a return to the spirit of Constantine V's Council of Hieria of 754. Theophilos was a more committed iconoclast than his father, Michael II, and so their relationship resembles that between Leo III the Isaurian and Constantine V, the renowned iconoclast emperors of the eighth century. In both cases, the father was a soldier of humble origins and the son brought up in the intellectually sophisticated environment of the imperial household. Theophilos' wife Theodora (r.\u2009842\u00a0\u2013\u00a0856) defended him, which mitigated the \"damnatio memoriae\" against him and his father Michael, nevertheless the later iconodule sources were highly critical of them.\nTheophilos was successful in establishing his reputation as a just ruler, and even hostile anti-Amorian chronicles retain accounts of his justice. Like Emperor Leo V the Armenian, he was viewed as close to the people and eager to defend them against injustices committed by their officials. However, Theophilos' dealings with the Empire's enemies drew criticism, particularly due to the loss of the fortress of Loulon and the city of Tyana in raids led by Caliph al-Ma'mun from 830 to 832, and the Sack of Amorium by Caliph al-Mu'tasim in 838. Nevertheless, his reputation as a just ruler endured, as can be seen in the composition \"Timarion\", in which Theophilos is featured as one of the judges in the Netherworld.\nTheophilos was a much more active patron of construction and renovation than Leo V or Michael II. He strengthened the Walls of Constantinople including the sea walls, built the fortress of Sarkel on the Don river in Khazar territories, created the Cherson and Chaldian themes, and built a hospital, which continued to exist until the twilight of the Byzantine Empire. In fact, his name is mentioned in inscriptions on the Walls more often than any other emperor.\nFamily.\nOn 5 June 830, the seventeen-year-old Theophilos married Theodora on the advice or command of his stepmother Euphrosyne (9th century). Theophilos and Theodora had seven children: two sons and five daughters. Euphrosyne retired to the Monastery of Gastria after her marriage. There she collaborated with Theodora to teach her daughters to venerate icons against the wishes of the iconoclast Theophilos. In 857, Emperor Michael III confined his mother Theodora and his sisters to Gastria where they became nuns.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFootnotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "74212", "revid": "27015025", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=74212", "title": "Volkswagen K\u00fcbelwagen", "text": "The Volkswagen Type 82 \"K\u00fcbelwagen (), or simply K\u00fcbel\", contractions of the original German word \"K\u00fcbelsitzwagen\" (translated: 'bucket-seat car' \u2014 but when the contractions are translated literally a back-formation of 'bucket' or 'tub'-car results), is a military light utility vehicle designed by Ferdinand Porsche and built by Volkswagen during World War II for use by the Nazi German military (both \"Wehrmacht\" and \"Waffen-SS\"). Based heavily on the Volkswagen Beetle, it was prototyped and first deployed in Poland as the Type 62, but following improvements entered full-scale production as the Type 82. Several derivative models, such as the \"Kommandeurswagen\", were also built in hundreds, or in dozens.\nThe four-wheel drivetrain that was prototyped in the rejected Type\u00a086 version went into mass production in the \"Schwimmwagen\". The Type 86 performed better in comparative testing, but the additional costs of the more complex four-wheel drivetrain (both financial, as well as making the light car heavier and thirstier) did not outweigh the benefits from the German viewpoint. The K\u00fcbelwagen was intended to be able to be manhandled by its crew if they got stuck. Easily seating four men, the empty weight \"K\u00fcbel\" was easier to lift than the heavier jeep. The rear bench would seat three in a pinch, for a total of five inside.\n\"K\u00fcbelwagen\" is a contraction of \"K\u00fcbelsitzwagen\", meaning \"bucket-seat car\". Before the war, this term became popular in Germany for light open-topped cross-country and military field cars without doors, because these were typically equipped with bucket seats to help keep occupants on board, necessary in an era before the adoption of seat belts. This body style had first been developed by Karosseriefabrik N. Trutz in 1923. The first Porsche Type 62 test vehicles had no doors and were therefore fitted with bucket seats as \"K\u00fcbelsitzwagen\", later shortened to \"K\u00fcbelwagen\". Despite later acquiring doors, and more regular, lower seats, the name \"K\u00fcbelwagen\" was retained. Besides the Volkswagen plant, Mercedes-Benz, Opel, and Tatra also built \"K\u00fcbel(sitz)wagen\", though they were all rear-wheel drive models only.\nThe \"K\u00fcbelwagen\"'s rolling chassis and mechanics were built at what was then the Stadt des KdF-Wagens, (\"City of the 'Strength through Joy'-Car\") \u2013 renamed Wolfsburg after 1945 \u2013 and its body was built by U.S.-owned firm Ambi Budd Presswerke in Berlin. The \"K\u00fcbelwagen\"'s role as a light multi-purpose military vehicle made it the German equivalent to the Allied Willys MB \"jeep\" and the GAZ-67, after previous efforts to mass-produce standardized military four-wheel drives for the \"Wehrmacht\" had largely failed.\nHistory.\nAlthough Adolf Hitler had discussed the possibility of military application of the Volkswagen with Ferdinand Porsche as early as April 1934, it was not until January 1938 that high-ranking \"Heereswaffenamt\" officials formally approached Porsche about designing an inexpensive, lightweight military transport vehicle that could operate reliably both on- and off-road, in even the most extreme conditions.\nPorsche began work on the project immediately, having a prototype of the vehicle ready within the month, but realized during development that it would not be enough to just reinforce the Beetle's chassis to handle the stresses that military use would place on it. In order to guarantee adequate off-road performance of a two-wheel-drive vehicle with a 1,000\u00a0cc FMCV 1 engine, it would have to be lightweight. In fact, the army had stipulated a gross weight of , including four battle-dressed troops, which meant that the vehicle itself should not weigh more than . Porsche therefore sub-contracted Trutz, an experienced military coachbuilder, to help out with the body design.\nDevelopmental testing by the military began after a presentation of the prototypes designated as Type 62 in November 1938. Despite lacking four wheel drive, the vehicle proved very competent at maneuvering its way over rough terrain, even in a direct comparison with a contemporary standard German Army 4x4, and the project was given the green light for further development. The vehicle's light weight and ZF self-locking differential compensated for the lack of a four-wheel drive.\nFurther development of the Type 62 took place during 1939, including a more angular body design, and pre-production models were field-tested in the invasion of Poland that started in September that year. Despite their overall satisfaction with the vehicle's performance, military commanders demanded a few important changes: the lowest speed of the vehicle had to be reduced from to as an adjustment to the marching pace of soldiers. Second, it needed some further improvement of its cross-country mobility. Porsche responded to both requests by mounting new axles with gear-reduction hubs, providing the car with more torque while at the same time increasing its ground clearance. Revised dampers, wheels, and a limited-slip differential, as well as countless small modifications completed the specification. In order to reflect the changes, the vehicle was renamed Type 82.\nFull-scale production of the Type 82 \"K\u00fcbelwagen\" started in February 1940, as soon as the VW factories had become operational. No major changes took place before production ended in 1945, only small modifications were implemented, mostly eliminating unnecessary parts and reinforcing others which had proved unequal to the task. Prototype versions were assembled with four-wheel-drive (Type 86) and different engines, but none offered a significant increase in performance or capability over the existing Type 82, so these designs went nowhere. As of March 1943, the car received a revised dash and the bigger 1,131\u00a0cc engine, developed for the \"Schwimmwagen\", that produced more torque and power than the original 985\u00a0cc unit. Power of the original, 1-litre engine is , while the larger, 1.1-litre unit offered .\nWhen Volkswagen production ceased at the end of the war, 50,435 \"K\u00fcbelwagen\" vehicles had been produced, and the vehicle had proven to be surprisingly useful, reliable, and durable.\nPost-war.\nUpon conquest of Germany by the Allies, the country was occupied in four sectors: a U.S., Soviet, U.K. and French sector respectively, and the massive Volkswagen factory and the town built for its workers, Wolfsburg, fell into the British sector. U.K. Major Ivan Hirst was put in charge of the factory and workers. He is largely credited with production resuming, and reopening the VW factory. He organized the clearance of bomb damage, and had the buildings repaired. He recommissioned machine tools, body presses and assembly jigs; he concerned himself with improving the quality of the civilian car, including starting a sales and service network and starting exports. Despite a damning report of Volkswagens by engineers from the British Rootes Group stating that: \"the vehicle does not meet the fundamental technical requirement of a motorcar...\", the British Army thought differently. When a surviving wartime Volkswagen was demonstrated to the British Rhine Army Group headquarters, the U.K. military ordered a batch of 20,000 similar vehicles. By the end of 1945, the factory had managed to put together 2,490 cars. Many of them were then bartered in exchange for materials to make more cars. Hirst turned production around to export civilian Volkswagens; the first export went to the Netherlands in 1947.\nLong after the end of the war, VW resurrected the basic \"K\u00fcbelwagen\" design as the 1969 Type 181, developed for the German Federal Armed Forces and later also produced this model for the civilian market, which was known as \"Thing\" in the US, \"Trekker\" in the UK, and \"Safari\" in Mexico. Although similar in looks and design, almost no parts were interchangeable with the original Type 82.\nIntermeccanica of Canada has been producing a K\u00fcbelwagen replica since 1995.\nTechnology and performance.\nWhen the German military took delivery of the first vehicles, it immediately put them to the test on- and off-road in snow and ice to test their capability at handling European winters. Several four-wheel-drive vehicles were used as reference points. The two-wheel-drive \"K\u00fcbelwagen\" surprised even those who had been a part of its development, as it easily out-performed the other vehicles in nearly every test. Most notably, thanks to its smooth, flat underbody, the \"K\u00fcbel\" would propel itself much like a motorised sled when the wheels sank into sand, snow, or mud, allowing it to follow tracked vehicles with remarkable tenacity.\nIn November 1943, the U.S. military conducted a series of tests as well on one or several Type 82s it had captured in North Africa campaign. This evaluation, done at the Army's Aberdeen Proving Ground, resulted in the publication of War Department Technical Manual TM E9-803, 6\u00a0June 1944 (on D-Day). The manual's publication date (D-Day) is assumed to be coincidental, but its TM number was identical to that of the American jeep, with the prefix 'E' for 'enemy'. It was intended for distribution after the 6\u00a0June invasion of Normandy to US military personnel who might encounter ones that had been abandoned, possibly for lack of fuel or a minor technical problem, and with the help of this manual, might be put into service as additional vehicles. The TM calls the type 82 'a four-wheeled, rubbertyred, rear axle drive personnel carrier and reconnaissance car, comparable in purpose and size to the American 1/4 ton truck'. So thorough was the analysis that it included information beyond what could be done as field servicing, plus ways of dealing with very low temperatures. U.S. War Department Technical Manual TM-E 30-451, \"Handbook on German Military Forces\", (p.\u00a0416), states: \"The \"Volkswagen\", the German equivalent of the American \"Jeep\", is inferior in every way except in the comfort of its seating accommodations.\"\nAt the same time, another \"K\u00fcbelwagen\", also captured in North Africa, had been dissected in Britain by engineers of the Humber Car Company, whose report said it exhibited no \"special brilliance\" in design except in details and that \"it is suggested that it is not to be regarded as an example of first class modern design to be copied by British industry\".\nAmong the design features that contributed to the \"K\u00fcbelwagen\"'s performance were:\nIn addition, the air-cooled engine proved highly tolerant of hot and cold climates alike, and was less vulnerable to bullets due to the absence of a radiator. For starting under winter conditions, a special, highly volatile starting fuel was supplied from a small auxiliary tank.\nAs the body was not a load-bearing part of the structure of the vehicle, it could easily be modified to special purposes, just like the jeep's.\nThe \"K\u00fcbelwagen\", thanks to its geared hubs, could go as slow as marching troops , yet reach a top speed of .\nVariants.\nThe following body types and variants of the Type 82 were produced:\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "74213", "revid": "45651287", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=74213", "title": "Irene of Athens", "text": "Byzantine empress regnant from 797 to 802\nIrene of Athens (, ; 750/756 \u2013 9 August 803), surname Sarantapechaena (, ), was Byzantine empress consort to Emperor Leo IV from 775 to 780, regent during the childhood of their son Constantine VI from 780 until 790, co-ruler from 792 until 797, and finally empress regnant and sole ruler of the Eastern Roman Empire from 797 to 802. A member of the politically prominent Sarantapechos family, she was selected as Leo IV's bride for unknown reasons in 768. Even though her husband was an iconoclast, she harbored iconophile sympathies. During her regency, she called the Second Council of Nicaea in 787, which condemned iconoclasm as heretical and brought an end to the (730\u2013787). Irene's concluding five years of sole rule were unprecedented in Roman and Byzantine history. Her public figure in this period was polarizing, due to the setbacks faced by the Empire and her iconophilic stances, often attributed to her gender and the influence of her retinue.\nAfter the death of her husband, Irene secured the throne for her family, setting herself in charge. During her regency with Constantine VI, she became very influential in government policies, largely overshadowing her son. As Constantine VI reached maturity, he began to move out from under the influence of his mother. In the early 790s, several revolts attempted to proclaim him as sole ruler. One of these revolts succeeded, but in 792 Irene was re-established in all imperial powers as \"co-emperor\" with Constantine VI. In 797, Irene organized a conspiracy in which her supporters gouged out her son's eyes. Constantine was imprisoned and probably died shortly afterwards. With him out of the way, Irene proclaimed herself sole ruler. Pope Leo III\u2014already seeking to break links with the Byzantine East\u2014used Irene's alleged unprecedented status as a female ruler of the Roman Empire to proclaim Charlemagne as Emperor of the Romans on Christmas Day of 800 under the pretext that a woman could not rule solely and thus the Roman throne was actually vacant. A revolt in 802 overthrew Irene and exiled her to the island of Lesbos, supplanting her on the throne with Nikephoros I. Irene died in exile less than a year later.\nEarly life.\nIrene was born in Athens sometime between 750 and 756. She was a member of the noble Greek Sarantapechos family, which had significant political influence in central mainland Greece. Although she was an orphan, her uncle or cousin Constantine Sarantapechos was a patrician and possibly also a \"strategos\" (\"military general\") of the theme of Hellas at the end of the eighth century. Constantine Sarantapechos' son, Theophylact, was a \"spatharios\" and is mentioned as having been involved in suppressing a revolt in 799. According to Theophanes the Confessor, Irene was related to Theophano of Athens who would become empress consort after her marriage to the Byzantine emperor Staurakios. Another unnamed female relative of Irene was later married to the Bulgar ruler Telerig in 776.\nEmpress consort.\nSelection and marriage.\nIt is unclear why and how Irene was selected as the bride for the young Leo IV. The influence of the prominent Sarantepechos family in the theme of Hellas likely played a part in the selection of Irene as the wife of the emperor's son, indicating the emperor's interest in restoring order in the Greek mainland. Especially unusual is that, while Constantine V was a militant iconoclast who was known for persecuting venerators of icons, Irene herself displayed iconophile predilections. This fact, combined with the limited information available about her family, has led some scholars to speculate that Irene may have been selected in a bride-show, in which eligible young women were paraded before the bridegroom until one was finally selected. If this was the case, then she would have been the first imperial bride to be selected in this manner. However, there is no solid evidence to support this hypothesis other than the apparent oddity of Irene's selection as Leo IV's bride.\nIrene arrived in Constantinople on 1 November 769, escorted, per Theophanes, by decorated \"dromones\" and \"\" (warships and galleys). She was betrothed to 19-year-old Leo IV, the son of emperor Constantine V, on 3 November at the Church of the Virgin of Pharos. The coronation took place on 17 December in the Augoustaion, and was followed by the couple's marriage at the Palace of Daphne within the Great Palace of Constantinople. On 14 January 771, Irene gave birth to a son, the future Constantine VI, who was named after his grandfather, Irene's father-in-law, Constantine V. When Constantine V died in September 775, Leo IV ascended to the throne at the age of twenty-five, and Irene became empress consort.\nIconoclasm.\nLeo IV, though an iconoclast like his father, initially pursued a policy of moderation towards iconophiles. He removed Constantine V's penalties on monasteries and began appointing monks as bishops. When Patriarch Nicetas I of Constantinople died in 780, Leo IV appointed Paul of Cyprus, who had iconophile sympathies, as his successor, although he did force him to swear oaths that he would uphold the official iconoclasm. During Lent of 780, however, Leo IV's policies on iconophiles became much harsher. He ordered for a number of prominent courtiers to be arrested, scourged, tonsured, and tortured after they were caught venerating icons.\nPrior to the death of her husband, Irene appears to have accepted the prevailing iconoclasm, regardless of her private beliefs. During this period, her activities are unknown, recorded only in later obscure accounts. According to the 11th century historian George Kedrenos, who wrote many centuries after Irene's death, this crackdown on iconophiles began after Leo IV discovered two icons hidden underneath Irene's pillow. Leo IV launched an investigation and discovered the courtiers who had brought the icons. He had them tortured and scolded Irene for violating the law and breaking with her faith. Irene insisted that she had not known the icons were there. After the incident, Leo refused to have marital relations with Irene ever again. Lynda Garland, a historian of the Byzantine Empire, states that this story too closely resembles a different story told about the later empress Theodora, wife of Theophilos, to be historically true. Nonetheless, she maintains that it is possible that Irene may have been trying to fill the palace with supporters of iconophilism, which may have triggered Leo IV's crackdown.\nRegent and empress.\nWhen Leo IV died on 8 September 780, rumors were circulated claiming that he had died of a fever after putting on the jeweled crown from the Great Church that had been dedicated by either Maurice (r.\u2009582\u00a0\u2013\u00a0602) or Heraclius (r.\u2009610\u00a0\u2013\u00a0641). It is uncertain whether Irene herself had promoted this rumor, perhaps in an attempt to smear her iconoclast husband's memory. Quickly after Leo IV's death, Irene became regent for their nine-year-old son Constantine VI and secured the throne for him by crushing the usurpation plots in favour of Leo's brothers in the following month.\nIn October, only six weeks after Leo IV's death, Irene was confronted with the conspiracy led by a group of prominent dignitaries that sought to raise Caesar Nikephoros, a half-brother of Leo IV, to the throne. Irene had Bardas (the former \"strategos\" of the Armeniac Theme), Gregory (the \"logothete\" of the \"dromos\"), and Konstantinos (the count of the excubitors) scourged, tonsured, and banished. She replaced all of them with dignitaries who were loyal to her. She had Nikephoros and his four brothers ordained as priests, a status which disqualified them from ruling, and forced them to serve communion at the Hagia Sophia on Christmas Day 780. On the same day, Irene returned the crown her husband had removed as part of a full imperial procession. Possibly hoping to placate supporters of her husband's family, Irene is reported to have proposed that Leo IV's sister Anthousa should join her as co-regent, but Anthousa is said to have rejected the offer.\nFrom the beginning, Irene seems to have taken more power for herself than was traditionally expected of female regents. Her earliest coins depict both herself and her son Constantine VI on the obverse, listing them as co-rulers rather than as ruler and regent. Furthermore, Irene is shown holding the orb, not Constantine, and only Irene's name is listed on the obverse of the coin, with Constantine VI's name only listed on the reverse, the less important side. Also, in all orders, both oral and written, Irene's name took precedence over her son's name, and she signed her orders in the name of the emperor in her own right and her name took precedence in the oath of allegiance. Apart from that, she did not allow Constantine any voice in public affairs. At the same time, Irene appears to have been well aware that her position as regent was insecure. The last female regent of the Byzantine Empire had been Empress Martina, who had only managed to survive as regent for less than a year before her tongue was cut out and she was exiled to the island of Rhodes. Most people were probably expecting that Irene's reign would come to a similarly swift and bloody end.\nIn 781 Irene accused the \"strat\u0113gos\" of Sicily, Elpidius, of participating in the conspiracy involving her brother-in-law Nikephoros. The military in Sicily prevented his arrest, so Irene sent a fleet which succeeded in defeating the rebels. Elpidius fled to Africa, where he defected to the Abbasid Caliphate. The fact that this revolt appears to reflect personal ambition or political conflicts centring in the capital, rather than local separatism, demonstrates the loyalty of the island to the Empire.\nAfter the success of Constantine V's general, Michael Lachanodrakon, who foiled an Abbasid attack on the eastern frontiers, a huge Abbasid army under Harun al-Rashid invaded Anatolia in summer 782, reaching Chrysopolis on the Asiatic side of the Bosphorus The \"strat\u0113gos\" of the Bucellarian Theme, Tatzates, defected to the Abbasids, and Irene had to agree to pay an embarrassing annual tribute of 100,000 dinars to the Abbasids.\nIn 783, Staurakios, eunuch and \"logothete\" of the \"dromos\" under Irene, led a successful campaign against the Sclaveni of Thessaly, Greece and the Peloponnese, returning with booty and captives. In 784, Irene capitalized on Constantine V's successes in Thrace and ordered Veria and Anchialos to be \"rebuilt\".\nBy 786, Harun, then the Abbasid Caliph, had made Raqqa his residence in order to secure control over the frontier. In 797/798, the Abbasids were said to have reached the Bosphorus again, but agreed to negotiate with the Byzantines due to the threat of the Khazars in the north. Nonetheless, he engaged in a campaign of assiduously strengthening the frontier with new districts and strongholds (\"al-Awasim\"), specifically from Cilicia through Germanikeia to Melitene. There was significant settlement and economic activity in the frontier region by the Abbasids, which was not typical in the time of the Umayyad Caliphate. Harun proved to be a capable commander and Irene and her successor Nikephoros I struggled to effectively resist his campaigns.\nEnding iconoclasm.\nIrene's most notable act was the restoration of the veneration of icons (images of Christ or the saints). Upon the death of the iconoclast Patriarch Paul IV of Constantinople, Irene elevated Tarasios, one of her partisans and former secretary, to the position of Patriarch of Constantinople in 784. As he was a layman, Pope Adrian I disapproved of his election. Irene and Tarasios summoned two church councils to solemnize the reversal of imperial policy to iconodulia. The first of these, assembled on 1 August 786 in the Church of the Holy Apostles at Constantinople, was dispersed by iconoclast \"tagmata\" (battalions stationed in the city) who were backed by iconoclast bishops. In autumn, Irene ordered them to respond to an alleged Arab attack in Asia Minor, then reconstituted the \"tagmata\" with soldiers from the thematic corps. Tarasios dealt with the episcopal opposition by allowing notoriously iconoclast bishops to retain their positions so long as they made a public admission of error, and also by disguising two eastern monks as envoys of the patriarchs of Antioch and Jerusalem, to justify the council's claim to ecumenical status. On 1 October 787, the monks and bishops assembled at Nicaea, a symbolic location as the site of the First Council of Nicaea in 325, to convene the seventh ecumenical council, which formally declared the veneration of icons as an article of faith, reuniting the Eastern church with that of Rome, which was signified by Adrian I's sending of two papal legates.\nThe council determined that the honorary veneration (') of the holy icons was permitted, and that the true adoration (') was reserved for God alone. It further stated that the honor paid to the icon eventually passes over to the individual that it represents, thus, veneration of an icon could not be idolatrous as the iconoclasts believed. The iconodule position was not justified by Christological arguments (as in the Council of Hieria of 754), rather, the antiquity of iconodulia and the Incarnation of Christ, which was said to make acceptable the depiction of Christ, were emphasized.\nThe \"Libri Carolini\" states that the ruling of the council against iconoclasm led to \"civil war\" within the Empire, and other ninth-century iconodule sources condemn clergymen and laymen who remained iconoclasts. While the council greatly improved relations with the papacy, it did not prevent the outbreak of a war with the Franks, who took over Istria and Benevento in 788. In spite of these reverses, Irene's military efforts met with some success: in 782 her favoured courtier Staurakios subdued the Slavs of the Balkans and laid the foundations of Byzantine expansion and re-Hellenization in the area. Nevertheless, Irene was constantly harried by the Abbasids, and in 782 and 798 had to accept the terms of the respective Caliphs al-Mahdi and Harun al-Rashid.\nFall and return to throne.\nAs Constantine VI approached maturity he began to grow restless under the autocratic sway of his mother. In 787, the plans for the marriage of Constantine and Rotrude, daughter of Charlemagne, were aborted, and in 788, Irene chose Maria of Amnia as a wife for him, beginning their unhappy marriage. In November 788, Irene suffered losses to the Bulgars and the failure of the expedition to Calabria, weakening her position. Although Constantine had reached the age of majority, Irene continued to administer the affairs of state in his place and was autocratess of the Romans.\nConstantine no longer accepted his secondary status and attempted to free himself by force. He plotted with his supporters, including Peter, a \"magistros\" and confidant of Constantine V, against Irene's advisers, especially Staurakios, who he planned to exile to Sicily. In early 790, Staurakios discovered the plot and informed Irene, who arrested the plotters, confined Constantine to his quarters and demanded that the army across the Empire take an oath of fidelity in her name alone. Irene also tried to convince the army to legitimize her absolute power over the state. The discontent which this caused swelled into open resistance and at first the Armeniacs refused to swear an oath to Irene alone but rather to Constantine and Irene. She sent the Armenian commander Alexios Mosele to persuade the Armeniacs, but they instead deposed their \"strat\u0113gos\" (who was appointed by Irene) and proclaimed Alexios the new \"strat\u0113gos\". When word of this spread throughout Asia Minor, other soldiers followed suit and deposed their commanders, marching into the Opsician Theme outside Constantinople. Irene was pressured to release Constantine, who was then proclaimed sole ruler in November 790 with the support of the military. \nConstantine restored his supporters including Michael Lachanodrakon, the famed general of Constantine V, and banished Staurakios and another eunuch and adviser to Irene, Aetios, to the Armeniac Theme. He confined Irene to her palace but did not formally depose her. He began a distinct foreign policy from his mother, beginning campaigns against the Bulgars in April 791 and the Arabs in September. In a hollow semblance of friendship, Constantine restored Irene's titles and confirmed her position as ruler in 792, even recalling Staurakios from exile. As a result, the official Irene-Constantine duumvirate began. The title of \"basileus\" was bestowed on Irene as \"co-emperor\" with her son Constantine VI when he readmitted her to imperial power in 792. Constantine proved incapable of sound governance, and suffered a humiliating defeat at the hands of Kardam of Bulgaria in the Battle of Marcellae of 792. A plot developed in favor of his uncle, the \"Caesar\" Nikephoros (son of Constantine V). Following the advice of Irene and Staurakios, Constantine had his uncle's eyes put out and the tongues of his father's four other half-brothers cut off. His former Armeniac supporters revolted after he had blinded their \"strat\u0113gos\" Alexios due to alleged involvement in the plot. They also disapproved of Irene's return as co-ruler. Constantine crushed this revolt with extreme cruelty in 793.\nIn summer 793, Arab raiders captured the important fortresses of Kamachon and Thebasa in Asia Minor; however, a larger force, accompanied by the rebellious former \"strat\u0113gos\" of Sicily, Elpidius retreated due to an early winter in 794, and Constantine defeated an Arab army in 795. Nevertheless, Arab raiders reached Amorion in 796, Ankara and Malagina in 798 and Ephesos in 799. Constantine personally led a force to meet Abbasid Caliph Harun al-Rashid (r.\u2009786\u00a0\u2013\u00a0809), but was sabotaged by agents of Irene who falsely reported an Arab retreat, prompting Constantine himself to retire. In 796, Constantine partially compensated for his previous losses against the Bulgars by ceasing to pay the tribute extracted after Marcellae and avoiding military defeat thereafter. The Balkan frontier was in general successfully stabilized by the Byzantines in this period.\nMoechian controversy and conspiracy to depose Constantine VI.\nDespite their collaboration, rivalry remained between the two co-rulers. Irene's faction also returned, with her powerful eunuch minister Staurakios once again at the helm, they began to take revenge on anyone who had opposed them in the past or present. The \"moechian\" controversy (from \"moicheia\", \"adultery\") was begun in 795, when Constantine forced his wife Maria to enter a convent because she allegedly attempted to poison him. He then married his mistress Theodote, which was technically an act of adultery. Patriarch Tarasios of Constantinople only offered a light penance for Constantine and Theodote, which caused monks of the monastery of Sakkoudion including Theodore the Stoudite to condemn the union and excommunicate Tarasios. Constantine closed the monastery and banished Theodore to Thessaloniki. Theodore was a prestigious and influential figure, so his opposition to Constantine was significant.\nIn 797, Irene exploited the controversy to prepare the overthrow of her son. She bribed palace officers to remain neutral and encouraged monastic opposition to the marriage. In August, her agents attempted to capture Constantine as he was travelling by boat from Constantinople to his summer residence. He fled to Pylae, but Irene persuaded her supporters there to capture him. On 19 August, Constantine was blinded and confined to a monastery. It is unknown whether he managed to survive this event. Tarasios was reconciled with Theodore, who was made the abbot of the Monastery of Stoudios and became one of Irene's most loyal supporters. \nAlthough it is often asserted that, as monarch, Irene called herself \"basileus\" (), \"emperor\", rather than \"basilissa\" (), \"empress\", in fact there are only three instances where it can be proven that she used the title \"basileus\": two legal documents in which she signed herself as \"Emperor of the Romans\" and a gold coin of hers found in Sicily bearing the title of \"basileus\". In relation to the coin, the lettering is of poor quality and the attribution to Irene may be problematic. She used the title \"basilissa\" in all other documents, coins, and seals.\nRelations with the Carolingian Empire.\nIrene's unprecedented position as an empress ruling in her own right was emphasized by the coincidental rise of the Carolingian Empire in Western Europe, which rivaled Irene's Byzantium in size and power. In 773, Charlemagne invaded Italy, annexing the Kingdom of the Lombards, in order to neutralize a threat to his succession in the form of his late brother Carloman I's wife and sons, who fled to the Lombard court in Pavia when Charlemagne seized his kingdom. He also campaigned against the Saxon tribes in northern Germany for more than thirty years, annexing their territory and compelling them to convert to Christianity, and defeated the Avars in Central Europe. In what is known as the Carolingian Renaissance, Charlemagne increasingly modelled his rule after that of the Roman emperors, sponsoring construction programs in conscious imitation of Roman and Byzantine architecture, as well as intellectual and artistic revival in general. His father Pepin the Short had reformed the currency and standardized weights, tightening royal control over mints.\nAs early as 781, Irene began to seek a closer relationship with the Carolingian dynasty and the Papacy in Rome, and Charlemagne's conquest of Pavia had allowed for renewed relations with the Byzantines. Through the eunuch Elissaeus, Irene negotiated a marriage between her son Constantine and Rotrude, a daughter of Charlemagne by his third wife Hildegard. During this time Charlemagne was at war with the Saxons, and would later become the new king of the Franks. Irene went as far as to send an official to instruct the Frankish princess in the \"language and literature of the Greeks and [...] in Roman imperial ways\", according to Theophanes. According to Charlemagne's biographer Einhard, he could not bear to lose his daughter and broke off the engagement. However, it is also possible that the new Frankish-Byzantine border, along with the oscillating allegiance of the powerful Duchy of Benevento, soured relations.\nIn 787, Pope Adrian I informed Charlemagne of reports of Byzantine invasion to restore Adalgis, the deposed Lombard king, with the support of Benevento, and drive the Franks from Italy. The invasion began in 788, but the Duke of Benevento sided with the Franks and defeated the Byzantines in Calabria. Alcuin of York claimed that 4,000 Byzantines were killed and 1,000 captured, including Patriarch Tarasios' brother, Sisinnius. The defeat led to a breakdown of Frankish-Byzantine relations. In 798, Irene diplomatically secured the return of Sisinnius.\nFrom 797, Irene once again attempted to normalize relations with the Franks, and a Byzantine legation arrived in the Frankish court in 798. However, on Christmas Day, 800, Charlemagne was crowned emperor by Pope Leo III. The clergy and nobles attending the ceremony proclaimed Charlemagne \"Augustus\". In support of Charlemagne's coronation, some argued that the imperial position was actually vacant, deeming a woman unfit to be emperor; however, Charlemagne made no claim to the Eastern Roman Empire. Whether he actually desired a coronation at all remains controversial\u2014Einhard related that Charlemagne had been surprised by the Pope\u2014but the Eastern Empire felt its role as the sole Roman Empire threatened and began to emphasize its superiority and its Roman identity. In 802, there were reports of a possible Frankish invasion of Sicily, to which Irene responded by sending a legation under the \"spatharios\" Leo. However, the campaign was abandoned and the Franks resumed marriage negotiations with the Byzantines.\nRelations between the two empires remained difficult. The coronation was viewed by the Byzantines as merely another Italian usurpation against imperial authority. Rather than opting for a military response, Irene maintained her contacts and endeavored to bring about a marriage between herself and Charlemagne, which was reciprocated to some degree by his court. However, as reported by Theophanes the Confessor, the scheme was frustrated by Aetios, eunuch and favorite of Irene, who was attempting to usurp her on behalf of his brother Leo. The discussions proved fruitless by the time Irene was overthrown, and Charlemagne remained resolute in his imperial ambitions.\nFinal years.\nIn her four-and-a-half years of sole rule (797\u2013802) Irene renewed diplomatic contact with the Franks and negotiated a tribute to Harun al-Rashid to cease hostilities, but also brutally crushed rebellions against her rule, blinding four of Constantine V's five sons. Irene's rule was popular due to her financial concessions, but weakened by factionalism, notably between two of her eunuch advisers, Staurakios and Aetios. In 800, Aetios accused Staurakios of plotting against Irene, but he died before the matter was resolved.\nIn October 802, officers led by the minister of finance (\"logothet\u0113s tou genikou\") Nikephoros deposed Irene. They were motivated both by Irene's financial laxity and benevolent tax policy as well as by the implications of a marriage alliance with the Franks. On 31 October, Nikephoros was crowned \"Nikephoros I\" by Patriarch Tarasios of Constantinople in the Hagia Sophia. Irene was initially exiled to the nearby island of Prinkipo, but was suspected of plotting with Aetios, and was soon banished to Lesbos, where she supported herself by spinning wool. She died in Lesbos the following year, on 9 August 803; her remains were later moved to the Church of the Holy Apostles in Constantinople.\nAssessment and legacy.\nIrene's reign represents the decline of the Isaurian dynasty. The legacy of the first and greatest Isaurian emperors, Leo III and Constantine V, was the rescue of the Empire from destruction at the hands of the Arabs and the Bulgars, while Irene's reign saw increasing losses and threat of war. Her character also departs significantly from her Isaurian predecessors, who were typically warlike and populist. She contradicted them in the blinding of her son, abolishing of iconoclasm and military weakness. The \"tagmata\", old guard units stationed in Constantinople who surrounded the emperor on the battlefield, were supported by Constantine V but demoted and reconstituted by Irene for frustrating the meeting of the iconodule council in 786. She elevated eunuchs to power against the imperial administration, one of the most significant of whom was Staurakios. In contrast, Constantine V supported the imperial office, which proved resilient to the political and military crises of the eighth century. It was Irene's financial laxity and benevolent tax policy that led to the palace coup by the minister of the treasury, Nikephoros, in 802, which was witnessed by Charlemagne's ambassadors.\nA female relative of Irene, Theophano, was chosen by Nikephoros (r.\u2009802\u00a0\u2013\u00a0811) as the bride of his son and heir Staurakios.\nAlthough Irene was an iconodule, Theophanes the Confessor, one of the few major primary sources of the eighth century, depicts her very unsympathetically due to his dislike of the involvement of women in imperial matters. However, Irene's zeal in restoring the icons and monasteries made Theodore the Studite praise her as a saint. He also commended her for ending the Isaurian policy of demanding payments from soldiers' widows as compensation for the loss of military personnel, in order for their households to continue receiving tax exemptions and a pension. She is listed in some Byzantine Catholic and Eastern Orthodox sources as a saint commemorated on 7 August, but her name is not found in the Menaion.\nMedia.\nH. Rider Haggard incorporated Irene as a villain in his novel \"The Wanderer's Necklace\".\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nPrimary sources\nModern sources"}

{"id": "74215", "revid": "494861", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=74215", "title": "Natural History (Pliny)", "text": "Encyclopaedia written by Pliny the Elder\nThe Natural History () is a Latin work by Pliny the Elder. The largest single work to have survived from the Roman Empire to the modern day, the \"Natural History\" compiles information gleaned from other ancient authors. Despite the work's title, its subject area is not limited to what is today understood by natural history; Pliny himself defines his scope as \"the natural world, or life\". It is encyclopaedic in scope, but its structure is not like that of a modern encyclopaedia. It is the only work by Pliny to have survived, and the last that he published. He published the first 10 books in AD 77, but had not made a final revision of the remainder at the time of his death during the AD\u00a079 eruption of Vesuvius. The rest was published posthumously by Pliny's nephew, Pliny the Younger.\nThe work is divided into 37 books, organised into 10 volumes. These cover topics including astronomy, mathematics, geography, ethnography, anthropology, human physiology, zoology, botany, agriculture, horticulture, pharmacology, mining, mineralogy, sculpture, art, and precious stones.\nPliny's \"Natural History\" became a model for later encyclopaedias and scholarly works as a result of its breadth of subject matter, its referencing of original authors, and its index.\nOverview.\nPliny's \"Natural History\" was written alongside other substantial works (which have since been lost). Pliny (AD 23\u201379) combined his scholarly activities with a busy career as an imperial administrator for the emperor Vespasian. Much of his writing was done at night; daytime hours were spent working for the emperor, as he explains in the dedicatory preface addressed to Vespasian's elder son, the future emperor Titus, with whom he had served in the army (and to whom the work is dedicated). As for the nocturnal hours spent writing, these were seen not as a loss of sleep but as an addition to life, for as he states in the preface, \"Vita vigilia est\", \"to be alive is to be watchful\", in a military metaphor of a sentry keeping watch in the night. Pliny claims to be the only Roman ever to have undertaken such a work, in his prayer for the blessing of the universal mother:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Hail to thee, Nature, thou parent of all things! and do thou deign to show thy favour unto me, who, alone of all the citizens of Rome, have, in thy every department, thus made known thy praise.\nThe \"Natural History\" is encyclopaedic in scope, but its format is unlike a modern encyclopaedia. However, it does have structure: Pliny uses Aristotle's division of nature (animal, vegetable, mineral) to recreate the natural world in literary form. Rather than presenting compartmentalised, stand-alone entries arranged alphabetically, Pliny's ordered natural landscape is a coherent whole, offering the reader a guided tour: \"a brief excursion under our direction among the whole of the works of nature\u00a0...\" The work is unified but varied: \"My subject is the world of nature\u00a0... or in other words, life,\" he tells Titus.\nNature for Pliny was divine, a pantheistic concept inspired by the Stoic philosophy, which underlies much of his thought, but the deity in question was a goddess whose main purpose was to serve the human race: \"nature, that is life\" is human life in a natural landscape. After an initial survey of cosmology and geography, Pliny starts his treatment of animals with the human race, \"for whose sake great Nature appears to have created all other things\". This teleological view of nature was common in antiquity and is crucial to the understanding of the \"Natural History\". The components of nature are not just described in and for themselves, but also with a view to their role in human life. Pliny devotes a number of the books to plants, with a focus on their medicinal value; the books on minerals include descriptions of their uses in architecture, sculpture, art, and jewellery. Pliny's premise is distinct from modern ecological theories, reflecting the prevailing sentiment of his time.\nPliny's work frequently reflects Rome's imperial expansion, which brought new and exciting things to the capital: exotic eastern spices, strange animals to be put on display or herded into the arena, even the alleged phoenix sent to the emperor Claudius in AD 47 \u2013 although, as Pliny admits, this was generally acknowledged to be a fake. Pliny repeated Aristotle's maxim that Africa was always producing something new. Nature's variety and versatility were claimed to be infinite: \"When I have observed nature she has always induced me to deem no statement about her incredible.\" This led Pliny to recount rumours of strange peoples on the edges of the world. These monstrous races \u2013 the Cynocephali or Dog-Heads, the Sciapodae, whose single foot could act as a sunshade, the mouthless Astomi, who lived on scents \u2013 were not strictly new. They had been mentioned in the fifth century BC by Greek historian Herodotus (whose history was a broad mixture of myths, legends, and facts), but Pliny made them better known.\n\"As full of variety as nature itself\", stated Pliny's nephew, Pliny the Younger, and this verdict largely explains the appeal of the \"Natural History\" since Pliny's death in the Eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79. Pliny had gone to investigate the strange cloud \u2013 \"shaped like an umbrella pine\", according to his nephew \u2013 rising from the mountain.\nThe \"Natural History\" was one of the first ancient European texts to be printed, in Venice in 1469. Philemon Holland's English translation of 1601 has influenced literature ever since.\nStructure.\nThe \"Natural History\" consists of 37 books. Pliny devised a \"summarium,\" or list of contents, at the beginning of the work that was later interpreted by modern printers as a table of contents. The table below is a summary based on modern names for topics.\nProduction.\nPurpose.\nPliny's purpose in writing the \"Natural History\" was to cover all learning and art so far as they are connected with nature or draw their materials from nature. He says:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;My subject is a barren one \u2013 the world of nature, or in other words life; and that subject in its least elevated department, and employing either rustic terms or foreign, nay barbarian words that actually have to be introduced with an apology. Moreover, the path is not a beaten highway of authorship, nor one in which the mind is eager to range: there is not one of us who has made the same venture, nor yet one among the Greeks who has tackled single-handed all departments of the subject.\nSources.\nPliny studied the original authorities on each subject and took care to make excerpts from their pages. His \"indices auctorum\" sometimes list the authorities he actually consulted, though not exhaustively; in other cases, they cover the principal writers on the subject, whose names are borrowed second-hand from his immediate authorities. He acknowledges his obligations to his predecessors: \"To own up to those who were the means of one's own achievements.\"\nIn the preface, the author claims to have stated 20,000 facts gathered from some 2,000 books and from 100 select authors. The extant lists of his authorities cover more than 400, including 146 Roman and 327 Greek and other sources of information. The lists generally follow the order of the subject matter of each book. This has been shown in Heinrich Brunn's \"Disputatio\" (Bonn, 1856).\nOne of Pliny's authorities is Marcus Terentius Varro. In the geographical books, Varro is supplemented by the topographical commentaries of Agrippa, which were completed by the emperor Augustus; for his zoology, he relies largely on Aristotle and on Juba, the scholarly Mauretanian king, \"studiorum claritate memorabilior quam regno\" (v. 16). Juba is one of his principal guides in botany; Theophrastus is also named in his Indices, and Pliny had translated Theophrastus's Greek into Latin. Another work by Theophrastus, \"On Stones\" was cited as a source on ores and minerals. Pliny strove to use all the Greek histories available to him, such as Herodotus and Thucydides, as well as the \"Bibliotheca Historica\" of Diodorus Siculus.\nWorking method.\nHis nephew, Pliny the Younger, described the method that Pliny used to write the \"Natural History\":\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Does it surprise you that a busy man found time to finish so many volumes, many of which deal with such minute details?... He used to begin to study at night on the Festival of Vulcan, not for luck but from his love of study, long before dawn; in winter he would commence at the seventh hour... He could sleep at call, and it would come upon him and leave him in the middle of his work. Before daybreak he would go to Vespasian\u00a0\u2013 for he too was a night-worker\u00a0\u2013 and then set about his official duties. On his return home he would again give to study any time that he had free. Often in summer after taking a meal, which with him, as in the old days, was always a simple and light one, he would lie in the sun if he had any time to spare, and a book would be read aloud, from which he would take notes and extracts.\nPliny the Younger told the following anecdote illustrating his uncle's enthusiasm for study:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;After dinner a book would be read aloud, and he would take notes in a cursory way. I remember that one of his friends, when the reader pronounced a word wrongly, checked him and made him read it again, and my uncle said to him, \"Did you not catch the meaning?\" When his friend said \"yes,\" he remarked, \"Why then did you make him turn back? We have lost more than ten lines through your interruption.\" So jealous was he of every moment lost.\nStyle.\nPliny's writing style emulates that of Seneca. It aims less at clarity and vividness than at epigrammatic point. It contains many antitheses, questions, exclamations, tropes, metaphors, and other mannerisms of the Silver Age. His sentence structure is often loose and straggling. There is heavy use of the ablative absolute, and ablative phrases are often appended in a kind of vague \"apposition\" to express the author's own opinion of an immediately previous statement, e.g.,\nPublication history.\nFirst publication.\nPliny wrote the first ten books in AD 77, and was engaged on revising the rest during the two remaining years of his life. The work was probably published with little revision by the author's nephew Pliny the Younger, who, when telling the story of a tame dolphin and describing the floating islands of the Vadimonian Lake thirty years later, has apparently forgotten that both are to be found in his uncle's work. He describes the as a \"Naturae historia\" and characterises it as a \"work that is learned and full of matter, and as varied as nature herself.\"\nThe absence of the author's final revision may explain many errors, including why the text is as John Healy writes \"disjointed, discontinuous and not in a logical order\"; and as early as 1350, Petrarch complained about the corrupt state of the text, referring to copying errors made between the ninth and eleventh centuries.\nManuscripts.\nAbout the middle of the 3rd century, an abstract of the geographical portions of Pliny's work was produced by Solinus. Early in the 8th century, Bede, who admired Pliny's work, had access to a partial manuscript which he used in his \"De natura rerum\", especially the sections on meteorology and gems. However, Bede updated and corrected Pliny on the tides.\nIn total there are some 307 extant medieval manuscripts of the work, however this was narrowed down to just 17 for work on the critical edition by Detlefsen (1858\u20131904). Olsen (1985) published details of all of Pliny's manuscripts pre-1200, however did not attempt to reconstruct the stemma.\nIn 1141 Robert of Cricklade wrote the \"Defloratio Historiae Naturalis Plinii Secundi\" consisting of nine books of selections taken from an ancient manuscript.\nThere are three independent classes of the stemma of the surviving Historia Naturalis manuscripts. These are divided into:\nThe textual tradition/stemma was established by the German scholars J. Sillig, D. Detlefsen, L. von Jan, and K. R\u00fcck in the 19th century. Two Teubner Editions were published of 5 volumes; the first by L. von Jan (1856\u201378; see external links) and the second by C. Mayhoff (1892-1906). The most recent critical editions were published by Les Belle Letters (1950\u2013) however Reeve (2007) identifies multiple imperfections with these editions. There is currently no fully critical edition of the text and the stemma codicum is only partially understood.\nAncient Codices.\n5th century: all later palimpsested in France. None of the later recensions seem to descend from these manuscripts. All bear witness to only very small portions of the Naturalis, with the Codex Moneus (M) containing the largest surviving fragments from books 11\u201315. Manuscripts M, P and Pal. Chat. were originally written in Italy but palimpsested in France within a century without being copied and forming a tradition of their own. \nMedieval Vetustiores.\nThe oldest surviving manuscripts of the Naturalis are known as \"vetustiores\" (\"older ones\"), all dating from the early 8th to 9th centuries. Even when combined, they do not come close to representing Pliny's full work of 37 books: the received text is dependent on the more recent \"recentiores\" and the relationship between the vetustiores and recentiores within the stemma codicum is not fully understood.\nThe manuscripts correspond with the Northumbrian Golden Age and Carolingian Renaissance. VLF 4 (known as \"the Leiden Pliny\") was produced during Bede's lifetime at the School of York, the earliest surviving manuscript written north of the Alps. At 41\u00a0cm by 29\u00a0cm it is among the largest medieval manuscripts written on parchment, each leaf requiring a whole hide (a total of at least 30 animals would have been required). However despite this there are no holes (insect bites), demonstrating its exceptional quality. Besides zoomorphic capitals, it is however plain and unilluminated for its size.\nIt was probably copied directly from an exemplar written in italic uncil script, requiring the Northumbrian scribe to devise new spacing and punctuation. The Naturalis Historia was possibly known to Aldhelm and certainly to Bede, in contrast to the palimseted fates of the earlier continental manuscripts. Through Alcuin's role in the Carolingian Renaissance, VLF 4 is thought to have been brought to the Frankish court at Aachen around 796 AD, perhaps as a learning aid. However it ultimately did not spawn any surviving copies.\nMedieval Recentiores (Prototypes).\nEven when combined, the vetustiores do not come close to representing Pliny's full work of 37 books: instead the prototype manuscripts (\"recentiores)\" all descend from a parallel branch of the stemma. Manuscripts DGV are the now separated sections of what was once a complete edition of books 1\u201337. The recentiores were used for the critical editions by Les Belles Lettres. \nLater medieval recensions.\nManuscript E appears to have been widely copied in the 11th and 12th centuries. BnF Lat. 6797 (late 12th) is considered to preserve elements of a parallel tradition by Reynolds (1983) but Reeve (2007) places it as a descendant of F. \nPrinted copies.\nThe work was one of the first classical manuscripts to be printed, at Venice in 1469 by Johann and Wendelin of Speyer, but John F. Healy described the translation as \"distinctly imperfect\". A copy printed in 1472 by Nicolas Jenson of Venice is held in the library at Wells Cathedral.\nTranslations.\nPhilemon Holland made an influential translation of much of the work into English in 1601. John Bostock and H. T. Riley made a complete translation in 1855. The Penguin edition was published in 1991 (reprinted by Penguin Classics in 2004), an abridged translation with an Introduction and notes by Healy.\nTopics.\nThe \"Natural History\" is generally divided into the organic plants and animals and the inorganic matter, although there are frequent digressions in each section. The encyclopaedia also notes the uses made of all of these by the Romans. Its description of metals and minerals is valued for its detail in the history of science, being the most extensive compilation still available from the ancient world.\nBook I serves as Pliny's preface, explaining his approach and providing a table of contents.\nAstronomy.\nThe first topic covered is Astronomy, in Book II. Pliny starts with the known universe, roundly criticising attempts at cosmology as madness, including the view that there are countless other worlds than the Earth. He concurs with the four (Aristotelian) elements, fire, earth, air and water, and records the seven \"planets\" including the Sun and Moon. The Earth is a sphere, suspended in the middle of space. He considers it a weakness to try to find the shape and form of God, or to suppose that such a being would care about human affairs. He mentions eclipses, but considers Hipparchus's almanac grandiose for seeming to know how Nature works. He cites Posidonius's estimate that the Moon is 230,000 miles away. He describes comets, noting that only Aristotle has recorded seeing more than one at once.\nBook II continues with natural meteorological events lower in the sky, including the winds, weather, whirlwinds, lightning, and rainbows. He returns to astronomical facts such as the effect of longitude on time of sunrise and sunset, the variation of the Sun's elevation with latitude (affecting time-telling by sundials), and the variation of day length with latitude.\nGeography.\nIn Books III to VI, Pliny moves to the Earth itself. In Book III he covers the geography of the Iberian peninsula and Italy; Book IV covers Europe; Book V looks at Africa and Asia, while Book VI looks eastwards to the Black Sea, India and the Far East.\nAnthropology.\nBook VII discusses the human race, covering anthropology and ethnography, aspects of human physiology and assorted matters such as the greatness of Julius Caesar, outstanding people such as Hippocrates and Asclepiades, happiness and fortune.\nZoology.\nZoology is discussed in Books VIII to XI. The entries begin with a discussion of terrestrial animals, taken to include mammals, reptiles, amphibians, and an assortment of mythological creatures recognised as real animals (e.g. dragons). The elephant, and the lion are described in detail, with accounts of behaviors, taming, and battles with bestiarii referenced. Other species are listed in relation to their geographic ranges, for example India and the far north. Domestic dogs, horses, and livestock feature prominently, with elaboration on their uses to humans, for example the types of wool produced by sheep and the cloth created from them.\nFrom there, \"the natural history of fishes\" is outlined. Pliny identified all aquatic animals as \"fishes\", making distinctions between those \"with red blood\" (cetaceans and traditional fishes) and those \"without blood\", the latter classified between \"soft fishes\" (cephalopods), those with \"thin crusts\" (e.g. crustaceans &amp; sea urchins), and those enclosed with hard shells (e.g. bivalves &amp; gastropods). As well, jellies are described with \"bodies of a third nature\" as a mix of animal and plant. The encyclopaedia mentions different sources of purple dye, particularly the murex snail, the highly prized source of Tyrian purple, as well as the value and origin of the pearl and the invention of fish farming and oyster farming. The keeping of aquariums was a popular pastime of the rich, and Pliny provides anecdotes of the problems of owners becoming too closely attached to their fish.\nBirds are described next, starting with the ostrich and the mythical phoenix. Much detail is spent with eagles, which are \"looked upon as the most noble\", followed by the other birds of prey. Pliny classifies birds based on the structure of their feet, noting the connection between their shape and the diet/habitat associated with their owners. He praises the song of the nightingale, and considers the connection between birdsong and omens. Bats are listed among the other \"winged animals\" but are recognised as viviparous and nurse their young with milk. This is followed by an extensive overview of animal reproduction, senses, and feeding &amp; resting behaviour.\nFinally, insects and other arthropods are listed. Pliny devotes considerable space to bees, which he admires for their industry, organisation, and honey, discussing the significance of the queen bee and the use of smoke by beekeepers at the hive to collect honeycomb. As well, the silkworm and silk production are described, the discovery of which is attributed to a woman named Pamphile (no reference is made to China). The coverage of zoology ends with an account of animal anatomy.\nPliny correctly identifies the origin of amber as the fossilised resin of pine trees. Evidence cited includes the fact that some samples exhibit encapsulated insects, a feature readily explained by the presence of a viscous resin. He mentions how it exerts a charge when rubbed.\nBotany.\nBotany is handled in Books XII to XVIII, with Theophrastus as one of Pliny's sources. The manufacture of papyrus and the various grades of papyrus available to Romans are described. Different types of trees and the properties of their wood are explained in Books XII to XIII. The vine, viticulture and varieties of grape are discussed in Book XIV, while Book XV covers the olive tree in detail, followed by other trees including the apple and pear, fig, cherry, myrtle and laurel, among others.\nPliny gives special attention to spices, such as pepper, ginger, and cane sugar. He mentions different varieties of pepper, whose values are comparable with that of gold and silver, while sugar is noted only for its medicinal value.\nHe is critical of perfumes: \"Perfumes are the most pointless of luxuries, for pearls and jewels are at least passed on to one's heirs, and clothes last for a time, but perfumes lose their fragrance and perish as soon as they are used.\" He gives a summary of their ingredients, such as attar of roses, which he says is the most widely used base. Other substances added include myrrh, cinnamon, and balsam gum.\nDrugs, medicine and magic.\nA major section of the \"Natural History\", Books XX to XXIX, discusses matters related to medicine, especially plants that yield useful drugs. Pliny lists over 900 drugs, compared to 600 in Dioscorides's , 550 in Theophrastus, and 650 in Galen.\nThe poppy and opium are mentioned; Pliny notes that opium induces sleep and can be fatal. Diseases and their treatment are covered in book XXVI.\nPliny addresses magic in Book XXX. He is critical of the Magi, attacking astrology, and suggesting that magic originated in medicine, creeping in by pretending to offer health. He names Zoroaster of Ancient Persia as the source of magical ideas. He states that Pythagoras, Empedocles, Democritus and Plato all travelled abroad to learn magic, remarking that it was surprising anyone accepted the doctrines they brought back, and that medicine (of Hippocrates) and magic (of Democritus) should have flourished simultaneously at the time of the Peloponnesian War.\nAgriculture.\nThe methods used to cultivate crops are described in Book XVIII. He praises Cato the Elder and his work \"De Agri Cultura\", which he uses as a primary source. Pliny's work includes discussion of all known cultivated crops and vegetables, as well as herbs and remedies derived from them. He describes machines used in cultivation and processing the crops. For example, he describes a simple mechanical reaper that cut the ears of wheat and barley without the straw and was pushed by oxen (Book XVIII, chapter 72). It is depicted on a bas-relief found at Trier from the later Roman period. He also describes how grain is ground using a pestle, a hand-mill, or a mill driven by water wheels, as found in Roman water mills across the Empire.\nMetallurgy.\nPliny extensively discusses metals starting with gold and silver (Book XXXIII), and then the base metals copper, mercury, lead, tin and iron, as well as their many alloys such as electrum, bronze, pewter, and steel (Book XXXIV).\nHe is critical of greed for gold, such as the absurdity of using the metal for coins in the early Republic. He gives examples of the way rulers proclaimed their prowess by exhibiting gold looted from their campaigns, such as that by Claudius after conquering Britain, and tells the stories of Midas and Croesus. He discusses why gold is unique in its malleability and ductility, far greater than any other metal. The examples given are its ability to be beaten into fine foil with just one ounce producing 750 leaves four inches square. Fine gold wire can be woven into cloth, although imperial clothes usually combined it with natural fibres like wool. He once saw Agrippina the Younger, wife of Claudius, at a public show on the Fucine Lake involving a naval battle, wearing a military cloak made of gold. He rejects Herodotus's claims of Indian gold obtained by ants or dug up by griffins in Scythia.\nSilver, he writes, does not occur in native form and has to be mined, usually occurring with lead ores. Spain produced the most silver in his time, many of the mines having been started by Hannibal. One of the largest had galleries running up to two miles into the mountain, while men worked day and night draining the mine in shifts. Pliny is probably referring to the reverse overshot water-wheels operated by treadmill and found in Roman mines. Britain, he says, is very rich in lead, which is found on the surface at many places, and thus very easy to extract; production was so high that a law was passed attempting to restrict mining.\nFraud and forgery are described in detail; in particular coin counterfeiting by mixing copper with silver, or even admixture with iron. Tests had been developed for counterfeit coins and proved very popular with the victims, mostly ordinary people. He deals with the liquid metal mercury, also found in silver mines. He records that it is toxic, and amalgamates with gold, so is used for refining and extracting that metal. He says mercury is used for gilding copper, while antimony is found in silver mines and is used as an eyebrow cosmetic.\nThe main ore of mercury is cinnabar, long used as a pigment by painters. He says that the colour is similar to \"scolecium\", probably the kermes insect. The dust is very toxic, so workers handling the material wear face masks of bladder skin. Copper and bronze are, says Pliny, most famous for their use in statues including colossi, gigantic statues as tall as towers, the most famous being the Colossus of Rhodes. He personally saw the massive statue of Nero in Rome, which was removed after the emperor's death. The face of the statue was modified shortly after Nero's death during Vespasian's reign, to make it a statue of Sol. Hadrian moved it, with the help of the architect Decrianus and 24 elephants, to a position next to the Flavian Amphitheatre (now called the Colosseum).\nPliny gives a special place to iron, distinguishing the hardness of steel from what is now called wrought iron, a softer grade. He is scathing about the use of iron in warfare.\nMineralogy.\nIn the last two books of the work (Books XXXVI and XXXVII), Pliny describes many different minerals and gemstones, building on works by Theophrastus and other authors. The topic concentrates on the most valuable gemstones, and he criticises the obsession with luxury products such as engraved gems and hardstone carvings. He provides a thorough discussion of the properties of fluorspar, noting that it is carved into vases and other decorative objects. The account of magnetism includes the myth of Magnes the shepherd.\nPliny moves into crystallography and mineralogy, describing the octahedral shape of the diamond and recording that diamond dust is used by gem engravers to cut and polish other gems, owing to its great hardness. He states that rock crystal is valuable for its transparency and hardness, and can be carved into vessels and implements. He relates the story of a woman who owned a ladle made of the mineral, paying the sum of 150,000 sesterces for the item. Nero deliberately broke two crystal cups when he realised that he was about to be deposed, so denying their use to anyone else.\nPliny returns to the problem of fraud and the detection of false gems using several tests, including the scratch test, where counterfeit gems can be marked by a steel file, and genuine ones not. He refers to using one hard mineral to scratch another, presaging the Mohs hardness scale. Diamond sits at the top of the series because, Pliny says, it will scratch all other minerals.\nArt history.\nPliny's chapters on Roman and Greek art are especially valuable because his work is virtually the only available classical source of information on the subject.\nIn the history of art, the original Greek authorities are Duris of Samos, Xenocrates of Sicyon, and Antigonus of Carystus. The anecdotic element has been ascribed to Duris (XXXIV:61); the notices of the successive developments of art and the list of workers in bronze and painters to Xenocrates; and a large amount of miscellaneous information to Antigonus. Both Xenocrates and Antigonus are named in connection with Parrhasius (XXXV:68), while Antigonus is named in the indexes of XXXIII\u2013XXXIV as a writer on the art of embossing metal, or working it in ornamental relief or intaglio.\nGreek epigrams contribute their share in Pliny's descriptions of pictures and statues. One of the minor authorities for books XXXIV\u2013XXXV is Heliodorus of Athens, the author of a work on the monuments of Athens. In the indices to XXXIII\u2013XXXVI, an important place is assigned to Pasiteles of Naples, the author of a work in five volumes on famous works of art (XXXVI:40), probably incorporating the substance of the earlier Greek treatises; but Pliny's indebtedness to Pasiteles is denied by Kalkmann, who holds that Pliny used the chronological work of Apollodorus of Athens, as well as a current catalogue of artists. Pliny's knowledge of the Greek authorities was probably mainly due to Varro, whom he often quotes (e.g. XXXIV:56, XXXV:113, 156, XXXVI:17, 39, 41).\nFor a number of items relating to works of art near the coast of Asia Minor and in the adjacent islands, Pliny was indebted to the general, statesman, orator and historian Gaius Licinius Mucianus, who died before 77. Pliny mentions the works of art collected by Vespasian in the Temple of Peace and in his other galleries (XXXIV:84), but much of his information about the position of such works in Rome is from books, not personal observation. The main merit of his account of ancient art, the only classical work of its kind, is that it is a compilation ultimately founded on the lost textbooks of Xenocrates and on the biographies of Duris and Antigonus.\nIn several passages, he gives proof of independent observation (XXXIV:38, 46, 63, XXXV:17, 20, 116 seq.). He prefers the marble \"Laoco\u00f6n and His Sons\" in the palace of Titus (widely believed to be the statue that is now in the Vatican) to all the pictures and bronzes in the world (XXXVI:37). The statue is attributed by Pliny to three sculptors from the island of Rhodes: Agesander, Athenodoros (possibly son of Agesander) and Polydorus.\nIn the temple near the Flaminian Circus, Pliny admires the Ares and the Aphrodite of Scopas, \"which would suffice to give renown to any other spot\". He adds:\nAt Rome indeed the works of art are legion; besides, one effaces another from the memory and, however beautiful they may be, we are distracted by the overpowering claims of duty and business; for to admire art we need leisure and profound stillness (XXXVI:27).\nMining.\nPliny provides lucid descriptions of Roman mining. He describes gold mining in detail, with large-scale use of water to scour alluvial gold deposits. The description probably refers to mining in Northern Spain, especially at the large Las M\u00e9dulas site. Pliny describes methods of underground mining, including the use of fire-setting to attack the gold-bearing rock and so extract the ore. In another part of his work, Pliny describes the use of undermining to gain access to the veins. Pliny was scathing about the search for precious metals and gemstones: \"Gangadia or quartzite is considered the hardest of all things\u00a0\u2013 except for the greed for gold, which is even more stubborn.\"\nBook XXXIV covers the base metals, their uses and their extraction. Copper mining is mentioned, using a variety of ores including copper pyrites and marcasite, some of the mining being underground, some on the surface. Iron mining is covered, followed by lead and tin.\nReception.\nMedieval and early modern.\nThe anonymous fourth-century compilation \"Medicina Plinii\" contains more than 1,100 pharmacological recipes, the vast majority of them from the \"Historia naturalis\"; perhaps because Pliny's name was attached to it, it enjoyed huge popularity in the Middle Ages.\nIsidore of Seville's \"Etymologiae\" (\"The Etymologies\", c.\u2009600\u2013625) quotes from Pliny 45 times in Book XII alone; Books XII, XIII and XIV are all based largely on the \"Natural History\". Through Isidore, Vincent of Beauvais's \"Speculum Maius\" (\"The Great Mirror\", c. 1235\u20131264) also used Pliny as a source for his own work. In this regard, Pliny's influence over the medieval period has been argued to be quite extensive. For example, one twentieth-century historian has argued that Pliny's reliance on book-based knowledge, and not direct observation, shaped intellectual life to the degree that it \"stymie[d] the progress of western science\". This sentiment can be observed in the early modern period when Niccol\u00f2 Leoniceno's 1509 \"De Erroribus Plinii\" (\"On Pliny's Errors\") attacked Pliny for lacking a proper scientific method, unlike Theophrastus or Dioscorides, and for lacking knowledge of philosophy or medicine.\nSir Thomas Browne expressed scepticism about Pliny's dependability in his 1646 \"Pseudodoxia Epidemica\":\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Now what is very strange, there is scarce a popular error passant in our days, which is not either directly expressed, or diductively contained in this Work; which being in the hands of most men, hath proved a powerful occasion of their propagation. Wherein notwithstanding the credulity of the Reader is more condemnable then the curiosity of the Author: for commonly he nameth the Authors from whom he received those accounts, and writes but as he reads, as in his Preface to Vespasian he acknowledgeth.\nModern.\nGrundy Steiner of Northwestern University, in a 1955 judgement considered by Thomas R. Laehn to represent the collective opinion of Pliny's critics, wrote of Pliny that \"He was not an original, creative thinker, nor a pioneer of research to be compared either with Aristotle and Theophrastus or with any of the great moderns. He was, rather, the compiler of a secondary sourcebook.\"\nThe Italian author Italo Calvino, in his 1991 book \"Why Read the Classics?\", wrote that while people often consult Pliny's \"Natural History\" for facts and curiosities, he is an author who \"deserves an extended read, for the measured movement of his prose, which is enlivened by his admiration for everything that exists and his respect for the infinite diversity of all phenomena\". Calvino notes that while Pliny is eclectic, he was not uncritical, though his evaluations of sources are inconsistent and unpredictable. Further, Calvino compares Pliny to Immanuel Kant, in that God is prevented by logic from conflicting with reason, even though (in Calvino's view) Pliny makes a pantheistic identification of God as being immanent in nature. As for destiny, Calvino writes:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThe art historian Jacob Isager writes in the introduction to his analysis of Pliny's chapters on art in the \"Natural History\" that his intention is:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;to show how Pliny in his encyclopedic work \u2013 which is the result of adaptations from many earlier writers and according to Pliny himself was intended as a reference work \u2013 nevertheless throughout expresses a basic attitude to Man and his relationship with Nature; how he understands Man's role as an inventor (\"scientist and artist\"); and finally his attitude to the use and abuse of Nature's and Man's creations, to progress and decay.\nMore specifically, Isager writes that \"the guiding principle in Pliny's treatment of Greek and Roman art is the function of art in society\", while Pliny \"uses his art history to express opinions about the ideology of the state\".\nPaula Findlen, writing in the \"Cambridge History of Science\", asserts that \n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Natural history was an ancient form of scientific knowledge, most closely associated with the writings of the Roman encyclopedist Pliny the Elder\u00a0... His loquacious and witty \"Historia naturalis\" offered an expansive definition of this subject. [It] broadly described all entities found in nature, or derived from nature, that could be seen in the Roman world and read about in its books: art, artifacts, and peoples as well as animals, plants, and minerals were included in his project.\nFindlen contrasts Pliny's approach with that of his intellectual predecessors Aristotle and Theophrastus, who sought general causes of natural phenomena, while Pliny was more interested in cataloguing natural wonders, and his contemporary Dioscorides explored nature for its uses in Roman medicine in his great work \"De Materia Medica\".\nIn the view of Mary Beagon, writing in \"The Classical Tradition\" in 2010:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;the \"Historia naturalis\" has regained its status to a greater extent than at any time since the advent of Humanism. Work by those with scientific as well as philological expertise has resulted in improvements both to Pliny's text and to his reputation as a scientist. The essential coherence of his enterprise has also been rediscovered, and his ambitious portrayal, in all its manifestations, of 'nature, that is, life'.. is recognised as a unique cultural record of its time.\nBibliography.\nThe Teubner, Loeb and Bud\u00e9 editorial collections all cover the work in its entirety. The Teubner was the first to be completed (1870\u201378), with the Loeb published 1938\u201362 and finally the Bud\u00e9 between 1947 and 2015.\nTeubner Latin Editions:\nLoeb Classical Library Editions (Latin &amp; English):\nCollection Bud\u00e9 (Latin &amp; French):\nEnglish Translations:\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\nPrimary.\nLatin\nEnglish\nItalian"}

She was the last sovereign of the Macedonian dynasty, that ruled the Byzantine Empire for almost 200 years.\nTheodora was the youngest daughter of Emperor Constantine\u00a0VIII. After Theodora's father died in 1028, her older sister Zo\u00eb co-ruled with her husbands Romanos\u00a0III and Michael\u00a0IV, kept Theodora closely watched. After two foiled plots, Theodora was exiled to an island monastery in the Sea of Marmara in 1031. A decade later, the people of Constantinople rose against Michael\u00a0IV's nephew and successor, Michael\u00a0V, and insisted that Theodora return to rule alongside Zo\u00eb.\nAfter 65 days Zo\u00eb married again, to Constantine\u00a0IX, who assumed the imperial responsibilities. Theodora seemingly retired to a convent after Zo\u00eb's death in 1050. When Constantine died, the 74-year-old Theodora returned to the throne despite fierce opposition from court officials and military claimants. For 16 months she ruled as empress in her own right before succumbing to a sudden illness and dying at 76. She was the last ruler of the Macedonian line.\nEarly life.\nTheodora was the third and youngest daughter of Byzantine Emperor Constantine VIII and Helena, daughter of Alypius. She was \"Porphyrogenita\", \"born into the purple\"; the appellation for a child born in the capital to a reigning emperor. Her father became co-emperor in 962 and sole emperor upon the death of his brother Basil II in 1025. His reign as sole emperor lasted less than three years, from 15 December 1025 to 12 November 1028.\nAs an eligible imperial princess, Theodora was considered as a possible bride for the Holy Roman Emperor in the west, Otto III, in 996. However, she was overlooked in favour of her sister Zo\u00eb. Otto III died before any marriage could occur. Basil II prevented his nieces from marrying any of the Byzantine nobility, calculating that such a marriage would have given their husbands a claim on the imperial throne. As women, Theodora and Zo\u00eb were unable to exercise any state authority; their only say in this was in choosing, or more likely accepting or not, a husband who would acquire their authority upon marriage. Consequently, Theodora lived a life of virtual obscurity in the imperial \"gynaeceum\" (women's quarters).\nIntelligent and possessing a strong and austere character, Theodora defied Constantine\u2014by then, sole emperor\u2014by refusing to marry the man her father had chosen to succeed him, Romanos Argyros, stating that Romanos was already married\u2014his wife having become a nun to allow Romanos to marry into the imperial family. Theodora further claimed that since Romanos and she were third cousins, it was too close a blood relationship for marriage to occur. Consequently, Constantine VIII chose Theodora's sister. Zo\u00eb married Romanos three days before her father died.\nWith the accession of Romanos, Theodora prudently retreated back into the \"gynaeceum\", with its daily religious routines. Still, Zo\u00eb persuaded her husband to appoint one of his own men as the chief of Theodora's household, with orders to spy on her. Shortly afterwards, Theodora was accused of plotting to marry the Bulgarian prince Presian and usurp the throne with him. Presian was blinded and sent to a monastery; Theodora was not punished. In 1031 she was implicated in a similar conspiracy, this time with Constantine Diogenes, the Archon of Sirmium. Theodora was forcibly confined in the monastery of Petrion. During a visit, Zo\u00eb compelled her sister to \"assume the monastic habit.\" Theodora remained there for the next 11 years as Zo\u00eb managed the empire with her husbands Romanos III and, after his death, Michael IV.\nCo-empress with Zo\u00eb.\nWith Michael IV's death in December 1041, Zo\u00eb adopted Michael's nephew, who was crowned as Michael V. Although he promised to respect Zo\u00eb, he promptly banished her to a monastery on the Princes' Islands on charges of attempted regicide. This treatment of the legitimate heir to the Macedonian dynasty caused a popular uprising in Constantinople, and on 19 April 1042, the people revolted against Michael V in support of not only Zo\u00eb, but Theodora as well. Michael V, desperate to keep his throne, initially brought Zo\u00eb back from Princes' Island and displayed her to the people, but the population rejected his proposal that he continue to rule alongside Zo\u00eb.\nKey members of the court decided that flighty Zo\u00eb needed a co-ruler, and backed the people's demand that it should be Theodora. A delegation, headed by the patrician Constantine Cabasilas, went to the monastery at Petrion to convince Theodora to become co-empress. Theodora, accustomed to a life of religious contemplation, rejected their pleas out of hand, and fled to the convent chapel to seek sanctuary. Constantine and his retinue pursued her, forcibly dragged her out and exchanged her monastic clothes for imperial ones. At an assembly at Hagia Sophia, the people escorted the now furious Theodora and proclaimed her empress with Zo\u00eb. They were both crowned at dawn on 21 April. After the ceremony, the mob stormed the palace, forcing Michael\u00a0V to escape to a monastery.\nZo\u00eb immediately assumed power and tried to force Theodora back to her monastery, but the Senate and the people demanded that the two sisters should jointly reign. As her first act Theodora was called upon to deal with Michael V. Zo\u00eb, weak and easily manipulated, wanted to pardon and free Michael, but Theodora was far more strict. She initially guaranteed Michael's safety before ordering that he be blinded and spend the rest of his life as a monk. With Michael V dealt with, Theodora refused to leave Hagia Sophia until she had received a formal invitation from Zo\u00eb, some 24 hours after they had been crowned. Officially Theodora was the junior empress, and her throne was situated slightly behind Zo\u00eb's on all public occasions. In practice she was the driving force behind the joint administration. The sisters administered the empire, focusing on curbing the sale of public offices and on the administration of justice. Although contemporary historian Michael Psellus claimed the joint reign was a complete failure, John Scylitzes stated that they conscientiously rectified the abuses of the previous reigns.\nAlthough Theodora and Zo\u00eb appeared together at meetings of the Senate or when they gave public audiences, it was soon apparent that their joint reign was under considerable strain. Still jealous of Theodora, Zo\u00eb had no desire to administer the empire, but she would not allow Theodora to conduct public business alone. Court factions formed behind each empress. After two months of increasing acrimony between them, Zo\u00eb decided to search for a new husband, thereby denying Theodora the opportunity to increase her influence through her obvious talents for governing. She eventually married Constantine IX, on 11 June 1042, and the management of the empire reverted to him. Although Theodora and Zo\u00eb continued to be recognised as empresses, and although Theodora continued to appear at all official functions, power devolved onto her brother-in-law. Nevertheless, Theodora exerted influence at court, as demonstrated by her ordering the arrest and blinding of John the Eunuch, the powerful administrator who had been the chief minister of Romanos III, the brother of Michael IV, and the uncle of Michael V; he had lived in exile after the fall of Michael V.\nConstantine IX's preferential treatment of his mistress in the early part of his reign caused rumours that he was planning to murder Theodora and Zo\u00eb. This led to a popular uprising by the citizens of Constantinople in 1044, which came dangerously close to actually harming Constantine who was participating in a religious procession along the streets of Constantinople. The mob was only quieted by the appearance on a balcony of Zo\u00eb and Theodora, who reassured the mob they were in no danger of assassination.\nReturn to power.\nAfter Zo\u00eb's death in 1050, Theodora seems to have retired to a convent, leaving Constantine IX to rule alone until his own death on 11 January 1055. As Constantine lay dying, he was persuaded by his councilors, chiefly the \"logothetes tou dromou\" John, to ignore the rights of Theodora and to pass the throne to the \"doux\" (Duke) of the Byzantine Theme of Bulgaria, Nikephoros Proteuon. However, Theodora preempted their plans when, despite her advanced age, she vigorously asserted her right to rule. She came out of retirement and convened the Senate, and the imperial guard proclaimed her \"emperor\" shortly before Constantine's death.\nA purge of senior officials and the leadership of the European military units followed. Nikephoros Proteuon was arrested at Thessalonica and forcibly tonsured. Nikephoros Bryennios, whom the western \"tagmata\" apparently wanted to proclaim emperor instead, was dismissed and exiled on Theodora's orders, after which she confiscated his estates and banished his supporters from court.\nTheodora controlled the nobles and checked numerous abuses. She damaged her reputation, however, with excessive severity toward private enemies and undue employment of such menials as Leo Paraspondylos as her advisors. Military and court offices were filled by her household eunuchs, and such able commanders as Isaac Komnenos were replaced with minor functionaries. Determined to centralize as much power in her hands as possible, she presided in person in the Senate and heard appeals as supreme judge in civil cases. Her appointment of clerics offended the Patriarch Michael Keroularios, who considered this the duty of men, not women.\nDuring Theodora's sole ruling period, her coins and seals bear the inscription 'Theodora, \u03b4\u03ad\u03c3\u03c0\u03bf\u03b9\u03bd\u03b1 (d\u00e9spoina) and porphyrogenita' and 'Theodora, Augusta and porphyrogenita'.\nWhen Theodora was seventy-six, the patriarch Michael Keroularios advocated that Theodora advance a subject to the throne through marriage to her, in order to assure a succession. She refused to consider marriage, no matter how token. She also refused to name an heir to the throne. Theodora became gravely ill with an intestinal disorder in late August 1056. On 31 August her advisors, chaired by Leo Paraspondylos, met to decide whom to recommend to her as a successor. According to Psellus, they selected Michael Bringas, an aged civil servant and former military finance minister whose main attraction was that \"he was less qualified to rule than he was to be ruled and directed by others\". Theodora was unable to speak, but Paraspondylos decided that she had nodded at an appropriate moment. Hearing of this the Patriarch refused to believe it. Eventually he was persuaded and Bringas was crowned as Michael VI. Theodora died a few hours later and with her death, the Macedonian dynasty's 189-year rule ended.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "74217", "revid": "48820289", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=74217", "title": "Olympic flame", "text": "Symbol of the Olympic Games\nThe Olympic flame is a symbol used in the Olympic movement. It is also a symbol of continuity between ancient and modern games. The Olympic flame is lit at Olympia, Greece. This ceremony starts the Olympic torch relay, which formally ends with the lighting of the Olympic cauldron during the opening ceremony of the Olympic Games. Through 2022, the flame would continue to burn in the cauldron for the duration of the Games, until it was extinguished during the Olympic closing ceremony. In 2024, electric lighting and mist were used to create a simulated flame for the Olympic cauldron, with the actual flame kept in a lantern exhibited at an adjacent location. That lantern was then taken by French swimmer L\u00e9on Marchand from Jardins des Tuileries (where the Olympic cauldron, that was extinguished at that moment, was located) and ceremonially \"transferred\" to the Stade de France at the start of the Closing Ceremony; there it was finally extinguished just after the IOC president officially closed the Games.\nOrigins.\nThe first time that a symbolic flame made its appearance in the Summer Olympic Games was for the 1928 Summer Olympics in Amsterdam. The main purpose of this fire, placed in a large bowl on top of a slender tower, named \"the Marathon Tower\", was to indicate for miles around where in Amsterdam the Olympic Games were being held. This tower was associated with the marathon race and all its elements, including the fire, were an idea of the architect Jan Wils who also had designed the stadium.\nThe idea for the Olympic flame was derived from ancient Greek ceremonies where a sacred fire was kept burning throughout the celebration of the ancient Olympics on the altar of the sanctuary of Hestia. In Ancient Greek mythology, fire had divine connotations and it was thought to have been stolen from the gods by Prometheus. Sacred fires were present at many ancient Greek sanctuaries, including those at Olympia. Every four years, when Zeus was honoured at the Olympic Games, additional fires were lit at his temple and that of his wife, Hera. The modern Olympic flame is ignited every two years in front of the ruins of the temple of Hera.\nWhen the idea of a symbolic fire was introduced during the 1928 Summer Olympics, an employee of the Electric Utility of Amsterdam lit the first symbolic flame in the Marathon Tower of the Olympic Stadium in Amsterdam. The Olympic flame and the Olympic torch relay was first introduced to the Summer Olympics at the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin by Carl Diem. The first ever torch-lighting ceremony was held in Olympia, Greece on July 20th, 1936. The torches used were made by Krupp, and the mirror used to light the flame was made by Zeiss Optics, both companies with links to the Nazi government of the time.\nMain ceremonies.\nLighting of the flame.\nThe Olympic flame is ignited some weeks or months before the opening ceremony of the Olympic Games at the main site of the ancient Olympics in Olympia, Greece.\nA group of women representing the Vestal Virgins (usually 11 in number) perform a celebration at the Temple of Hera, during which a fire is kindled by the light of the Sun, its rays concentrated by a parabolic mirror. The fire is used to light the first torch of the Olympic Torch Relay. Where cloudy weather prevents the use of the parabolic mirror on the day of the ceremony (as in 2024), a backup flame is used that has been lit during a prior dress rehearsal. An actress plays the role of the temple's high priestess and presents the torch and an olive branch to the first relay bearer, usually a Greek athlete who has already qualified to compete in that edition of the Games. This is followed by a recitation of a poem by Pindar, and the release of a flock of doves to symbolize peace.\nAt the beginning of the ceremony, the Olympic hymn is sung first followed by the national anthem of the country hosting the Olympics and the national anthem of Greece along with the hoisting of the flags.\nAfter the ceremony at Olympia the Olympic flame first travels to Greece. It first goes to the Coubertin Grove on the site of the International Olympic Academy, where it is used to light an altar beside the final resting place of Pierre de Coubertin's heart. The flame is then transferred during a ceremony in the Panathenaic Stadium in Athens from the Hellenic Olympic Committee to the current year's National Olympic Committee (NOC) and local Organizing Committee (OCOG) hosts.\nThe Olympic torch relay, which transports the Olympic flame from Olympia, Greece to the various designated sites of the Games, had no ancient precedent and was introduced by Carl Diem at the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin, Germany.\nAt the first Olympic torch relay, the flame was transported from Olympia to Berlin over 3,187 kilometers (1,980 miles) by 3,331 runners in twelve days and eleven nights. Nazi Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels commissioned filmmaker and propagandist Leni Riefenstahl to film the event. \nIn the 1956 Melbourne Games in Australia, local veterinary student Barry Larkin protested against the relay when he tricked onlookers by carrying a fake flame, consisting of a pair of underpants set on fire in a plum pudding can, attached to a chair leg. He successfully managed to hand over the fake flame to Mayor of Sydney Pat Hills and escape without being noticed.\nThe Olympic torch travels routes that symbolise human achievement or the history of the host country. Although most of the time the torch with the Olympic flame is still carried by runners, it has been transported in many different ways. The fire travelled by boat in 1948 and 2012 to cross the English Channel and was carried by rowers in Canberra as well as by dragon boat in Hong Kong in 2008.\nIt was first transported by airplane in 1952 when the flame travelled to Helsinki. In 1956, all carriers in the torch relay to Stockholm, where the equestrian events were held instead of in Melbourne, travelled on horseback.\nRemarkable means of transportation were used in 1976, when the flame was transformed to a radio signal and transmitted from Europe to the New World: Heat sensors in Athens detected the flame, the signal was sent to Ottawa via satellite where it was received and used to trigger a laser beam to re-light the flame. The torch, but not the flame, was taken into space by astronauts in 1996, 2000 and 2014. Other unique means of transportation include a Native American canoe, a camel, and Concorde. The torch has been carried across water; during the French leg of the 1968 Winter Olympics was carried across the port of Marseille by a diver holding it aloft above the water. In 2000, an underwater flare was used by a diver across the Great Barrier Reef en route to the Sydney Games. In 2012 it was carried by boat across Bristol Harbour in the UK and on the front of a London Underground train to Wimbledon.\nIn 2004, the first global torch relay was undertaken, a journey that lasted 78 days. The Olympic flame covered a distance of more than 78,000\u00a0km in the hands of some 11,300 torchbearers, travelling to Africa and South America for the first time, visiting all previous and future Summer Olympic cities, and finally returning to Greece for the 2004 Summer Olympics.\nThe 2008 Summer Olympics torch relay spanned six continents before proceeding through China. However, there was protests against China's human rights record in London where a \"ring of steel\" was formed around the flame to protect it, but one protester managed to grab hold of the torch while it was being held by television presenter Konnie Huq. In Paris the torch was extinguished at least twice by Chinese officials (five times according to French police) so that it could be transported in a bus amid protests while it was being paraded through Paris. This eventually led to the cancellation of the relay's last leg in the city. Demonstrations were also held in San Francisco and the route the torch would take was cut in half.\nAs a result, in 2009, the International Olympic Committee announced that from the 2010 Winter Olympics onward, the future torch relays could be held only within the country hosting the Olympics after the initial Greek leg was finished. Although this rule took effect with the 2010 Winter Olympics, the organizers of the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, and 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro chose to hold their torch relays only in their respective hosting countries of the United Kingdom, Russia, and Brazil (except for brief stops in the United States, Ireland, and Switzerland, respectively). In 2016, ten days before the beginning of the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, citizens of Angra dos Reis, a city near Rio de Janeiro, managed to extinguish the Olympic flame during a protest against the city spending money on hosting the Olympics despite an economic crisis in Brazil.\nThe Olympic torch relay in the host country ends with the lighting of the Olympic cauldron during the opening ceremony in the central host stadium of the Games. The final carrier is often kept unannounced until the last moment. Over the years, it has become a tradition to let a famous athlete of the host nation, former athletes or athletes with significant achievements and milestones be the last runner in the Olympic torch relay.\nRe-igniting the flame.\nIt is not uncommon for the Olympic flame to be accidentally or deliberately extinguished during the course of the torch relay (and on at least one occasion the cauldron itself has gone out during the Games). To guard against this eventuality, multiple copies of the flame are transported with the relay or maintained in backup locations. When a torch goes out, it is re-lit (or another torch is lit) from one of the backup sources. Thus, the fires contained in the torches and Olympic cauldrons all trace a common lineage back to the same Olympia lighting ceremony.\nThe design of 2004 had a safeguard built into it: There are two flames inside the torch. There is a highly visible (yellow flame) portion that burns cooler and is more prone to extinguish in wind and rain, but there is also a smaller hotter (blue in the candle's wick) flame akin to a pilot light hidden inside the torch which is protected from wind and rain and is capable of relighting the cooler, more visible portion if it is extinguished. The fuel contained inside the torch is able to keep it lit for approximately 15 minutes before it would be extinguished.\nSelected relays in detail.\nThe flame is transported from Greece to the host country where the flame is transported by torch around the host nation to the main stadium.\nOlympic cauldron lighting.\nDuring the opening ceremony the final bearer of the torch runs towards the cauldron, often placed at the top of a grand staircase, and then uses the torch to start the flame in the stadium. The climactic transfer of the Olympic flame from the final torch to the cauldron at the central host stadium marks the symbolic commencement of the Games.\nAs with being the final runner of the Olympic torch relay, it is considered to be a great honor to light the Olympic cauldron, and in the same way it has become a tradition to select notable athletes to conduct this part of the ceremony. On other occasions, the people who lit the cauldron in the stadium are not famous but nevertheless symbolize Olympic ideals. Japanese runner Yoshinori Sakai was born on the day of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima. He was chosen for the role to symbolize Japan's postwar reconstruction and peace, opening the 1964 Tokyo Games. At the 1976 Games in Montreal, two teenagers\u00a0\u2014 one from the French-speaking part of the country, one from the English-speaking part\u00a0\u2014 symbolized the unity of Canada.\nAt the 2012 Games in London, the torch was carried by Sir Steve Redgrave to a group of seven young British athletes (Callum Airlie, Jordan Duckitt, Desiree Henry, Katie Kirk, Cameron MacRitchie, Aidan Reynolds and Adelle Tracey) \u00a0\u2014 each nominated by a British Olympic champion\u00a0\u2014 who then each lit a single tiny flame on the ground, igniting 204 copper petals before they converged to form the cauldron for the Games.\n \nThe first well-known athlete to light the cauldron in the stadium was the ninefold Olympic Champion Paavo Nurmi, who excited the home crowd in Helsinki in 1952. In 1968, Enriqueta Basilio became the first woman to light the Olympic Cauldron at the Olympic Games in Mexico City.\nPerhaps one of the most spectacular of Olympic cauldron lighting ceremonies took place at the 1992 Summer Olympics opening ceremony, when Paralympic archer Antonio Rebollo lit the cauldron by shooting a burning arrow over it, which ignited gas rising from the cauldron, although there are theories that the cauldron was manually forced to ignite. Two years later, the Olympic fire was brought into the stadium of Lillehammer by a ski jumper. In Beijing 2008, Li Ning \"ran\" on air around the interior edge of the Beijing National Stadium's roof, and lit a cauldron attached to it.\nOlympic cauldron designs.\nThe cauldron and the pedestal are always the subjects of unique and often dramatic design. These also tie in with \"how\" the cauldron is lit during the Opening Ceremony. After being lit, the flame in the Olympic cauldron continues to burn during the Games, until the closing ceremony, when it is finally put out symbolizing the official end of the Games.\nCoinage.\nThe Olympic flame has been used as a symbol and a main motif numerous times in different commemorative coins. A recent example was the 50th anniversary of the Helsinki Olympic Games commemorative coin, minted in 2002. In the obverse, the Olympic flame above the Earth can be seen. Finland is the only country highlighted; it was the host of the 1952 games.\nCommercialization.\nPrior to the 2002 Winter Olympics, professor Bob Barney co-authored the book \"Selling the Five Rings\" (2002), with Stephen Wenn and Scott Martyn, which discussed the history of corporate sponsorships and television rights for the Olympic Games. Barney argued that the Olympic torch had been commercialized since its inception in 1936, and that sponsors of the torch relay benefit from brand awareness; whereas the medal podium ceremonies which began in 1932, had not become commercialized since no advertising is allowed inside Olympic venues.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Although he was born to an obscure aristocratic family, his mother was related to the imperial Komnenos clan. He married Anna, a younger daughter of Emperor Alexios\u00a0III Angelos in 1200. He received the title of despot before 1203, demonstrating his right to succeed his father-in-law on the throne.\nThe Fourth Crusade forced AlexiosIII to flee from Constantinople in 1203. Theodore was imprisoned by the crusaders (commonly referred to as \"Latins\" by the Byzantines), but he escaped. After crossing the Bosporus into Asia Minor (in present-day Turkey), he started to organise the local Greeks' resistance against the Latins in Bithynia in his father-in-law's name. He concluded an alliance with the Seljuq sultan of Rum, but he could not stop the Latins' expansion. Neither could he prevent a claimant to the imperial throne, Alexios Komnenos, from establishing a Byzantine successor state, the Empire of Trebizond, in northern Asia Minor. Theodore's position consolidated only after Tzar Kaloyan of Bulgaria inflicted a crushing defeat on the Latins in the Battle of Adrianople (in Thrace) in 1205.\nGreeks fleeing from the Latin Empire \u2014 the crusader state that emerged in the Byzantine core territories \u2014 swarmed to Asia Minor to live under Theodore's rule. The Latins captured Theodore's father-in-law and made an alliance with AlexiosI of Trebizond, but Theodore routed their united troops. He secured the support of most Bithynian aristocrats and seized the domains of those who resisted him. In 1205, he assumed the traditional titles of the Byzantine emperors. Three years later, he convoked a Church council to elect a new Orthodox patriarch of Constantinople. The new patriarch crowned Theodore emperor and established his seat at Theodore's capital, Nicaea. The Orthodox population of the Latin Empire regarded Theodore as the main defender of their Church, but the rulers of Epirus\u2014a realm that developed in the western regions of the Byzantine Empire\u2014debated the legality of his coronation.\nTheodore's father-in-law did not abandon his claim to the throne. After being released from prison, AlexiosIII persuaded the Seljuqs to invade Nicaea, but Theodore defeated them in 1211. The Latin Emperor Henry of Flanders captured important fortresses in western Asia Minor in 1212, but he ran out of soldiers and could not place garrisons in them. Henry implicitly acknowledged the existence of the Empire of Nicaea in his peace treaty with Theodore. Theodore conquered western Paphlagonia on the Black Sea coast from AlexiosI of Trebizond. Around 1220, Theodore tried to persuade the Latins of Constantinople to acknowledge his rule, but they refused. Theodore established a powerful state, located in the vicinity of Constantinople, which enabled his successors to expel the Latins from the city and revive the Byzantine Empire in 1261.\nEarly life.\nParentage.\nTheodore Komnenos Laskaris was born to a noble, but not particularly renowned, Byzantine family around 1175. His parents' names are unknown. If Theodore followed the Byzantine custom of giving his father's name to his firstborn son, his father was called Nicholas. Theodore's mother belonged to an unidentified branch of the imperial Komnenos family and he proudly adopted her surname. Theodore had no fewer than six brothers \u2014 Constantine, George, Alexios, Isaac, Manuel and Michael. Manuel and Michael must have been born to a different mother, as they bore the surname Tzamantouros instead of Komnenos. Theodore was also related to the aristocratic Phokas family, most likely through the marriage of one of his aunts.\nThe Laskaris held estates in western Asia Minor. Both Theodore and his brother, Constantine, had a seal representing Saint George and bearing the inscription Diasorites. The seal expressed their connection to the monastery of Saint George Diasorites, located in Pyrgion in the valley of the river Kaistros.\nEarly career.\nThe contemporaneous historian Niketas Choniates introduced Theodore as a \"daring youth and fierce warrior\" in his chronicle. The slightly later historian George Akropolites recorded that Theodore was \"small in body but not excessively so, quite dark, and had a flowing beard forked at the end\". Theodore rose to prominence through his family ties with the Komnenoi. His first extant seal mentions his titles of \"sebastos\" and \"protovestiarites\". The first one was a court title, originally reserved for the Byzantine emperors' relatives, but Emperor Alexios III\u00a0Angelos (r.\u20091195\u00a0\u2013\u00a01203) started to sell it to wealthy merchants. As \"protovestiarites\", Theodore was the commander of a cadet unit of the guards of the imperial palace.\nEmperor AlexiosIII, who had no sons, wanted to solve the problem of succession by marrying off his two eldest daughters. Late in 1200, he gave his firstborn daughter, Irene, in marriage to Alexios Palaiologos, and her younger sister, Anna, to Theodore. Palaiologos was elevated to the rank of despot, demonstrating his right to succeed his father-in-law on the throne. When Palaiologos died before 1203, Theodore received the same title.\nFall of Constantinople.\nTo seize the Byzantine throne, Emperor AlexiosIII had blinded and imprisoned his elder brother, Isaac II Angelos (r.\u20091185\u00a0\u2013\u00a01195). Isaac's son, Alexios, fled from Constantinople to Germany to seek his Catholic relatives' assistance. He concluded an agreement with the leaders of the Fourth Crusade, promising a large sum, 800,000 \"hyperpyra\", for their support. The crusaders reached Constantinople and captured Pera on the opposite coast of the Golden Horn on 6July 1203. Theodore conducted raids against the invaders, but they laid siege to the Byzantine capital. The walls of Constantinople were vulnerable, and AlexiosIII fled in panic to Thrace during the night of 17\u201318\u00a0July. He drained the treasury and took the imperial insignia with him.\nIsaacII was released and his son was crowned his co-emperor as AlexiosIV. Theodore was imprisoned after his father-in-law's flight, but he escaped in September 1203. The details of his escape are unknown, but Choniates stated that Theodore left Constantinople \"armed only with practical wisdom and a brave spirit\". For a while, Theodore was hiding in a church dedicated to Saint Michael. Theodore himself claimed that God \"miraculously removed\" him from the prison and guided him across the Bosporus to Asia Minor. His wife and daughters accompanied him. They reached Nicaea, but the city's leadership only admitted his family, because they feared AlexiosIV's revenge. Theodore, as he later remembered, moved \"from one region to another\", avoiding the traps that his (unidentified) enemies laid for him.\nAlexiosIV could not pay off the crusaders. They refused to leave Constantinople and raided and plundered the nearby Thracian villages. The Byzantines blamed AlexiosIV for the crusaders' acts. The army rebelled and proclaimed the general Alexios Mourtzouphlos Doukas emperor on 28January 1204. IsaacII had already died, and the new emperor had AlexiosIV murdered, providing the crusaders with an excuse to make a new assault on Constantinople again. When they breached the walls on 12April, AlexiosV fled. A group of aristocrats offered the imperial crown to Theodore's brother, Constantine, but he rejected it. The crusaders captured Constantinople and plundered it completely.\nAlthough the Byzantine capital fell to the crusaders, neither AlexiosIII Angelos nor AlexiosV Doukas abandoned their claim to the throne. A third claimant soon appeared on the scene: a grandson of Emperor Andronikos\u00a0I Komnenos (r.\u20091183\u00a0\u2013\u00a01185), Alexios, seized Trebizond on the Black Sea coast in Asia Minor and assumed the title of emperor. The crusaders elected one of their leader, Baldwin of Flanders, emperor in May 1204.\nResistance.\nBy the time of Theodore's arrival, Asia Minor had been a centre of uprisings against the imperial government for decades. A rebellious magnate, Theodore Mangaphas, held Philadelphia; another aristocrat, Sabas Asidenos, ruled Sampson; and Nikephoros Kontostephanos controlled the lands on the upper course of the Maeander River. Theodore appeared as his father-in-law's representative and secured the Bithynian towns' loyalty in AlexiosIII's name until the end of 1204. The local Greeks acknowledged him as the \"strategos\" (or military leader) of Bithynia. He established his seat in Bursa, but he made frequent journeys to attend assemblies and dinners, encouraging the local Greeks' resistance against the \"Latins\", as the crusaders were universally called. He also took control of state revenues, and he could offer money to the Seljuq Sultan of Rum, Rukn al-Din Suleiman\u00a0II, in return for his assistance against the Latins. SuleimanII died and his underage son, Izz al-Din Kilij Arslan\u00a0III, succeeded him in June 1204.\nThe crusaders set up a commission to distribute the Byzantine territories among them in September. In Asia Minor, the \"duchy of Nicaea\" was granted to Louis\u00a0I, Count of Blois, and the \"duchy of Philadelphia\" to Stephen of Perche, although the Latins had not conquered these lands. The Venetians seized the port of Lampsacus on the Asian side of the Hellespont and a French knight, Peter of Bracieux, captured the nearby Pegai. Emperor AlexiosI of Trebizond's brother and co-emperor, David Komnenos, launched a military campaign into Paphlagonia and occupied the towns along the Black Sea coast. His conquest facilitated Bracieux's invasion of Bithynia. He routed Theodore at Poemanenum on 6December and his victory enabled him to seize Bythinian forts.\nThe Latins captured and publicly executed AlexiosV in Constantinople. They also arrested AlexiosIII in Thessaly, forcing him to cede the imperial insignia to them early in 1205. A grandson of Emperor Manuel\u00a0I Komnenos (r.\u20091143\u00a0\u2013\u00a01180), Manuel Maurozomes, and Maurozomes's son-in-law, the deposed Sultan of Rum, Ghiy\u0101th al-D\u012bn Kaykhusraw\u00a0I, came to Nicaea. Theodore detained them, but they soon came to terms. He lent money to Kaykhusraw to regain his throne in return for his promise of military support. Kaykhusraw and Maurozomes hurried to Konya, the capital of Rum. They dethroned the underage Kilij Arslan in Kaykhusraw's favor in March 1205.\nBy the end of 1204, the Latins had captured Thrace, Thessaly and northern Greece. Emperor AlexiosIII's cousin, Michael Doukas, who organised the Greeks' resistance in Epirus, was forced to swear fealty to Pope Innocent\u00a0III to secure his protection. Emperor Baldwin dispatched his brother, Henry, to conquer Asia Minor early in 1205. Henry defeated Theodore Mangaphas and Theodore Laskaris' brother, Constantine, in the Battle of Adramyttion on 19March 1205. The Latins could not follow up their victory, because Tzar Kaloyan of Bulgaria stirred up a rebellion in Thrace and invaded the province. Kaloyan's invasion forced Emperor Baldwin to withdraw his knights from Anatolia. Kaloyan inflicted a crushing defeat on the Latin army in the Battle of Adrianople on 14\u00a0April 1205. Louis of Blois and Stephen of Perche perished in the battlefield. Baldwin was captured and died in captivity in Bulgaria.\nTheodore emerged as the main beneficiary of Kaloyan's victory. The Latins' defeat revealed the fragility of their rule, and secured Theodore's position. Taking advantage of the moment, he expelled the Latin garrisons from most Anatolian fortresses, and transferred his capital from Bursa to Nicaea. Greeks were swarming to his realm from the European territories under Latin rule. Mangaphas ceded Philadelphia to Theodore, and Asidenos's lands were also absorbed into Theodore's realm. The local aristocrats supported Theodore against the rebellious magnates, and he awarded them with court titles. Theodore extracted an oath of fealty from Michael\u00a0I of Epirus's brother, Theodore Komnenos Doukas, who had settled in Asia Minor, before allowing him to leave for Epirus.\nReign.\nCoronation.\nDavid Komnenos dispatched an army to Bithynia, but Theodore defeated the invaders and their Latin allies at Nicomedia. Sultan KaykhusrawI sent Seljuq troops to his father-in-law, Maurozomes, to invade the valley of the Maeander River in the spring of 1205, but they were soon defeated. Theodore made a peace with Maurozomes, allowing him to rule two fortresses, Chonae and Laodicea on the Lycus, as the Sultan's lieutenant. Theodore assumed the title of emperor early in 1205\u2014either after his victory at Nicomedia or after his peace treaty with Maurozomes. His new title was an open challenge to the legitimacy of the Latin emperor in Constantinople; therefore, the Latins regarded him as an usurper, unlawfully ruling territories of their empire. Many Greeks also refused to recognize Theodore's claim to the emperorship because only coronation by the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople could legalize an emperor. Theodore approached Patriarch John Kamateros, who lived in exile in Thrace, offering to move him to Nicaea, but the elderly prelate refused.\nByzantine aristocrats, who had lost their Thracian, Thessalian or Peloponnesian estates, came to Nicaea and Theodore gave asylum to them. He could only finance a simplified state administration, but he invited former high-ranking Byzantine officials to Nicaea. His wife's uncle, the blind Basil Doukas Kamateros\u2014a former \"logothetes tou dromou\" (minister of foreign affairs)\u2014assisted him in setting up the new administrative system. He hired a Calabrian pirate, John Steiriones, to command his fleet in the Sea of Marmara. Theodore had great confidence in his brothers. He made them military commanders and rewarded them with court titles.\nPatriarch John Kamateros died in June 1206. The Orthodox clergy of Constantinople asked Pope InnocentIII to authorize them to elect a new patriarch, but the Latin authorities opposed their plan. The new Latin Emperor of Constantinople, Henry of Flanders, made an alliance with David Komnenos against Theodore. Theodore decided to capture Heraclea Pontica from David, but the Latins attacked his army from the rear when he was marching towards the town, and he had to abandon the campaign to chase the Latin troops off. The Latins invaded Asia Minor and captured Nicomedia and Cyzicus during the winter of 1206\u20131207. Theodore in turn allied himself with Kaloyan, who launched an incursion into Thrace, forcing Emperor Henry to recall his troops from Asia Minor. After Theodore and his brothers had laid siege to Nicomedia, Henry agreed to sign a two-year truce, authorizing Theodore to destroy two fortifications at Nicomedia and Cyzicus.\nThe Orthodox clerics' negotiations with the Holy See about the appointment of an Orthodox patriarch proved unsuccessful. Theodore addressed a letter to Pope InnocentIII, requesting that he authorize the Orthodox clerics to elect the new patriarch. He also tried to persuade the Pope to acknowledge him as the supreme head of the Orthodox community, but the Pope ignored both requests. When the Latins broke the truce early in 1208, Theodore again approached the Pope and asked him to mediate a peace, proposing the Sea of Marmara as the permanent frontier between the Latin Empire and his realm.\nOrthodox clerics urged Theodore to hold an election to decide a new Ecumenical Patriarch. Theodore convoked a Church council in Nicaea in Holy Week 1208. The assembled prelates elected a high-ranking cleric, Michael Autoreianos, patriarch on 20\u00a0March 1208. Autoreianos was related to Theodore's chief advisor, Kamateros. As his first act, the new patriarch crowned and anointed Theodore \"emperor and autocrat of the Romans\". The ceremony took place on Easter Sunday (6 April). Theodore's coronation by the new Ecumenical Patriarch sanctioned his claim to be the legitimate successor of the Byzantine monarchs. His legitimacy, however, could be challenged, because only a lawful emperor could appoint a legitimate patriarch and only a legitimate patriarch could crown a lawful emperor. Theodore's opponents argued that the council electing Michael Autoreianos was just an assembly of randomly chosen bishops, not a properly convoked synod. In response, his supporters emphasized that the exceptional situation after the fall of Constantinople required a flexible interpretation of laws.\nWars.\nFour realms developed from the ruins of the Byzantine Empire by 1209. AlexiosI and David Komnenos consolidated their Empire of Trebizond in northern Asia Minor; Henry of Flanders integrated Thrace and almost all of Greece into the Latin Empire; MichaelI Doukas secured his rule in Epirus; and TheodoreI Laskaris emerged as the unrivaled ruler of western Asia Minor. The balance of power, however, remained unstable, because the four monarchs were rivals, always ready to form alliances against their neighbors. Emperor Henry concluded an alliance with Sultan KaykhusrawI against Theodore, while Theodore allied himself with Kaloyan of Bulgaria's successor, Boril. Henry's vassal, MichaelI Doukas, paid off the ransom of Theodore's father-in-law, AlexiosIII in 1209 or 1210. AlexiosIII avoided Nicaea and went to Konya, seeking asylum at the court of KaykhusrawI, his adopted son.\nBoth Boril of Bulgaria and MichaelI Doukas wanted to expel the Latins from Thessalonica, prompting Emperor Henry to visit the town regularly. Taking advantage of Henry's absence, Theodore sent his fleet to attack Constantinople in the spring of 1211. Boril invaded Thrace, but he could not prevent Henry from returning to his capital. KaykhusrawI and AlexiosIII invaded Nicaea, forcing Theodore's troops to abandon the siege and hurry back to Asia Minor. The two armies met at Antioch on the Maeander in late spring or around 17\u00a0June. The Seljuq troops were close to winning the battle, but Theodore sought out Kaykhusraw and killed him in single combat. AlexiosIII was captured during the battle, and Theodore had his father-in-law imprisoned. He concluded a peace treaty with Kaykhushraw's son and successor, Kaykaus\u00a0I.\nTheodore sent letters to the Greeks under the Latins' rule to inform them of his triumph and to urge them to rise up against the \"Latin dogs\". However, he had only won a Pyrrhic victory, because his best troops\u2014his Latin mercenaries\u2014perished in the battlefield. Emperor Henry led his army across the Bosporus and routed Theodore's troops on the Rhyndakos River on 15October 1211. Henry captured Nymphaion and Pergamon. In a circular letter sent to the European monarchs early in 1212, he boasted of having subjugated the Greeks as far as the Seljuq frontier, save the garrisons of some fortresses. Henry had to end his military campaign because he did not have enough troops to garrison the captured fortresses. The two emperors made peace between 1212 and 1214 The peace confirmed the Latins' possession of the Troad region. The Latins also seized some strategically important Bithynian fortresses, taking control of the roads between the northern and southern territories of Theodore's realm. Theodore adopted an intensive fortification program. New fortresses were built, and the old fortresses' walls were restored. He also urged local officials to settle colonists around the new forts, granting arable lands to them.\nTheodore quickly recovered from his defeat. Taking advantage of a conflict between the Latin Empire and Serbia, Theodore and Sultan KaykausI invaded the Empire of Trebizond simultaneously in 1214. Theodore forced David Komnenos to abandon Heraclea Pontica on the Black Sea. Whether he conquered eastern Paphlagonia during this campaign, or only years later, is unclear. His conquest of the region put a narrow strip of land along the Black Sea coast under Nicaean control, and thus removed the emperors of Trebizond from the competition for Constantinople.\nConsolidation.\nThe Latin clerics wanted to compel the Orthodox population of Constantinople to adopt the Catholic liturgy and to pay the tithe, but they resisted. Pope InnocentIII sent Cardinal Pelagius as his legate to Constantinople in 1213 to discipline the Orthodox population for their resistance. Pelagius closed Orthodox churches and ordered the imprisonment of the resistant monks, but the Greeks did not give in and many of them fled to Nicaea. The Greek aristocrats approached Emperor Henry, asking him either to stop the persecution of Orthodoxy or to allow them to move to Nicaea. Henry capitulated and ordered the re-opening of Orthodox churches in Constantinople. Pelagius entered into negotiations with Theodore about a possible Church union at Heraclea Pontica, but their discussions proved inconclusive.\nMichael\u00a0I Komnenos Doukas was assassinated in late 1214 or in 1215. Theodore Komnenos Doukas, who succeeded him, questioned Theodore Laskaris's claim to supremacy, ignoring his previous oath of fealty. In concert with Demetrios Chomatenos, the ambitious Archbishop of Ochrid, Doukas denied the right of the patriarch residing in Nicaea to appoint bishops to the Balkan episcopal sees under Epirote control. Doukas's expansionist policy forced Emperor Henry to launch a military campaign against him, but Henry died unexpectedly before reaching Epirus. The Latin barons elected his brother-in-law, Peter of Courtenay, as his successor, but he was captured and killed in Epirus during his journey towards Constantinople in 1217. A lasting vacancy followed his death, with his widow, Yolanda of Flanders, ruling the Latin Empire as regent. She gave her daughter, Maria of Courtenay, in marriage to Theodore who agreed to prolong his peace treaty with the Latin Empire.\nYolande of Flanders died before October 1219. Theodore sent envoys to Constantinople to announce his claim to succeed her, but the Latin barons ignored it. Theodore proposed new negotiations about the Church union in 1219, taking advantage of the vacancy of the Latin patriarchate of Constantinople. He planned to convoke the Orthodox patriarchs of Constantinople, Antioch, Jerusalem and Alexandria to a synod in Nicaea, but the Orthodox clergy thwarted the idea. Jacopo Tiepolo, the \"Podest\u00e0\" (or head) of the Venetian community in Constantinople, convinced Theodore to spell out the Venetian merchants' privileges in a chrysobull in August 1219. The decree granted the Venetians the right to trade freely in the Empire of Nicaea and exempted them from taxation. The diploma also prohibited each party from copying or counterfeiting coins issued by the other. Theodore attempted to enforce his claim to Constantinople by force in 1220, but the Latins repelled his attack. The new Latin Emperor, Robert of Courtenay, came to Constantinople in March 1221. Peace between the two empires was soon restored.\nTheodore died in November 1221. A dynastic conflict followed because his two brothers, Alexios and Isaac, and his son-in-law, John Doukas Vatatzes, claimed the throne. The conflict ended with Vatatzes's victory; Theodore's brothers were forced into exile. Theodore was buried next to his father-in-law and his first wife in the monastery of Saint Hyakinthos in Nicaea.\nLegacy.\nWestern Asia Minor developed into an \"empire in exile\" during Theodore's reign. As the Byzantinist Warren Treadgold concludes, \"Theodore had built up a functioning [Byzantine] successor state\u00a0... from next to nothing\". He revived the Ecumenical Patriarchate and other fundamental Byzantine institutions. He also borrowed from the Latins and the Seljuqs\u2014the military offices of \"konostaulos\" (a hellenization of \"constable\") and \"tzaousios\" (from Turkish \"\u00e7avu\u015f\"), are first documented during his reign. He introduced his own currency, issuing electrum and billon coins, but he did not restore the Byzantine system of gold and copper coins. He levied regular taxes from 1216 at the latest. Following Byzantine patterns, he rewarded the aristocrats with tax-collecting rights. The Latins and the Venetians made treaties with him, thus acknowledging that his realm was destined to lasting existence.\nThe defence of the Orthodox faith was the central ideology of Theodore's realm. Niketas Choniates compiled his \"Treasury of Orthodoxy\"\u2014a treatise against heresy\u2014in the Nicaean court. He described the fall of Constantinople as a punishment for the Byzantines' sins and compared their exile into Asia Minor to the Israelites' Babylonian captivity. Theodore realized that he was unable to recapture Constantinople from the Latins, but located near the old Byzantine capital, Nicaea was ideally placed for its future reconquest.\nHistorian Dimiter Angelov emphasizes that Theodore's political success was \"due, in no small part, to his sanguine and pragmatic approach\". He had an itinerant court, travelling from place to place and discussing political issues with the local noblemen. He was not afraid of commanding his armies in person. He hired Latin mercenaries, offering them salaries higher than the rulers of the Latin Empire.\nFamily.\nTheodore's first wife, Anna Komnene Angelina, was the second daughter of Emperor AlexiosIII. Her first husband, \"sebastokrator\" Isaac Komnenos Vatatzes, was a great-grandson of Emperor John\u00a0II Komnenos. He died childless in 1196. Theodore and Anna had three daughters and two sons.\nEmpress Anna died before 1213 and Theodore entered into negotiations about a new marriage with a daughter of Leo\u00a0I, King of Armenia. LeoI sent his niece, Philippa, to Nicaea, and Theodore married her at Christmas 1214. Historian Michael Angold proposes that Pope InnocentIII promoted a marriage alliance between Theodore and Leo to secure Theodore's support in his conflict with Emperor Henry during the War of the Antiochene Succession. Theodore repudiated Philippa for an unknown reason and disinherited her son. According to Angold, Theodore was informed only after the marriage that his wife was not Leo's daughter. Her son must have been born in 1214, because he was not yet eight years old when Theodore died.\nTheodore's third wife, Maria of Courtenay, was the daughter of Yolanda of Flanders and Peter\u00a0II of Courtenay. Theodore married Maria in the hope of intervening in the administration of the Latin Empire late in 1218 or early in 1219.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "74220", "revid": "6463349", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=74220", "title": "Theodore II Laskaris", "text": "Emperor of Nicaea from 1254 to 1258\nTheodore II Doukas Laskaris or Ducas Lascaris (; November 1221/1222 \u2013 16 August 1258) was Emperor of Nicaea from 1254 to 1258. He was the only child of Emperor John\u00a0III Doukas Vatatzes and Empress Irene Laskarina. His mother was the eldest daughter of Theodore\u00a0I Laskaris, who had established the Empire of Nicaea as a successor state to the Byzantine Empire in Asia Minor after the crusaders captured the Byzantine capital, Constantinople, during the Fourth Crusade in 1204. Theodore received an excellent education from two renowned scholars, Nikephoros Blemmydes and George Akropolites. He made friends with young intellectuals, especially with a page of low birth, George Mouzalon. Theodore began to write treatises on theological, historical and philosophical themes in his youth.\nEmperor John\u00a0III arranged for Theodore to marry Elena Asenina in 1235, to forge an alliance with her father, Ivan Asen\u00a0II, Emperor of Bulgaria, against the Latin Empire of Constantinople. According to Theodore himself, their marriage was happy, and they had five or six children. From 1241, Theodore acted as his father's lieutenant in Asia Minor during his frequent military campaigns in the Balkan Peninsula. From around 1242, he was his father's co-ruler, but was not crowned as co-emperor. During this period, his relationship with some prominent aristocrats, particularly Theodore Philes and Michael Palaiologos, grew tense.\nTheodore succeeded his father on 4\u00a0November 1254. He dismissed many high officials and army commanders of aristocratic origin, replacing them with loyal friends, including some of low birth. The same year, he made a defensive alliance with Kaykaus\u00a0II, the Seljuk Sultan of Rum, against the Mongol Empire. In 1256, he repelled a Bulgarian invasion of Thrace and Macedonia and forced Michael\u00a0II Komnenos Doukas, the ruler of Epirus, to cede Dyrrachium on the coast of the Adriatic Sea to Nicaea. He reformed the military, recruiting more soldiers from among the native peasantry of Asia Minor. Eventually, Michael\u00a0II of Epirus forged an alliance with Stefan Uro\u0161\u00a0I, King of Serbia, and Manfred of Sicily against Nicaea. Theodore's newly appointed generals could not resist their joint invasion in 1257. Theodore fell seriously ill and could rarely take part in state administration during the last months of his life. He appointed George Mouzalon regent for his underage son, John\u00a0IV, before dying of either chronic epilepsy or cancer. In ten days, Mouzalon fell victim to an aristocratic plot, and Michael Palaiologos assumed the regency, usurping the throne soon after.\nEarly life.\nChildhood.\nTheodore was born to Emperor John\u00a0III Doukas Vatatzes (r.\u20091221\u00a0\u2013\u00a01254) and Irene Laskarina in the imperial palace in Nicaea in late 1221 or early 1222. Irene was the eldest daughter of Theodore\u00a0I Laskaris (r.\u20091205\u00a0\u2013\u00a01221), the founder of the Empire of Nicaea. Nicaea was a successor state of the Byzantine Empire, established after the Catholic (\"Latin\") crusaders captured Constantinople during the Fourth Crusade in 1204. Vatatzes was Irene's third husband. He was born into a Byzantine aristocratic family related to the imperial dynasties of Komnenos and Angelos, and served as the commander of the imperial guard. Although Irene's two brothers had died prematurely, Theodore\u00a0I did not name Vatatzes as his official heir. He most likely expected that his third wife, the Latin Maria of Courtenay, would bear sons, but he did not father children with her. Theodore\u00a0I died in November 1221. Vatatzes had to defeat the late emperor's brothers, Alexios and Isaac Laskaris, to seize the throne. His victory over them and their Latin allies in the Battle of Poimanenon in the winter of 1223\u20131224 opened the way for the reconquest of Byzantine territories lost to the Latins in Asia Minor.\nTheodore was his parents' only child. His mother had been in a horse riding accident and could not bear children after his birth. He adopted his mother's family name. He was \"raised as usual for a royal child\", according to his own words, most probably referring to his upbringing in the women's quarter of the palace and the luxury surrounding him. His childhood was joyful and he \"often received greatest solace\" from his father. He also remembered his parents did not punish him when his tutor had accused him of misdemeanors.\nEducation.\nTheodore was probably entrusted to an elementary teacher's care in 1228 as most Nicaean aristocratic children's formal education began around the age of six. As part of his education, he memorized texts from the Bible and prayed three times a day. He could quote from the Psalms and the parables of Jesus by heart until the end of his life. Theodore's secondary education began around 1230. He detested his principal tutor (or \"baioulos\") and described him as a \"great babbler\" in his works, without mentioning his name. He studied grammar (that is Attic Greek), poetry, rhetoric, logic, mathematics, astronomy, geometry and music for three years. His grammatical studies raised his lifelong interest in words with multiple meanings and in etymologies. The young Theodore was captivated by the orations of Demosthenes and Hermogenes of Tarsus. He also held theologian Gregory of Nazianzus in high esteem. His tutor mocked him for \"philosophizing\" and urged Theodore to spend more time with military and diplomatic studies. Theodore was a passionate hunter and polo player with remarkable riding skills.\nNegotiations over Theodore's marriage with Elena Asenina began shortly after the Battle of Klokotnitsa, where Elena's father, Emperor (or Tzar) Ivan Asen\u00a0II of Bulgaria (r.\u20091218\u00a0\u2013\u00a01241), inflicted a crushing defeat on the Emperor of Thessalonica and ruler of Epirus, Theodore Komnenos Doukas (r.\u20091215\u00a0\u2013\u00a01230). The battle weakened Epirus\u2013Thessalonica, Nicaea's western rival for the revival of the Byzantine Empire, and made Bulgaria the dominant power of the Balkan Peninsula. The marriage of Theodore and Elena sealed their fathers' alliance against the Latin Empire of Constantinople in 1235. In the same year, Bulgarian and Nicaean troops laid siege to Constantinople, but could not capture the city. In 1237, Ivan Asen then reversed his position, allying himself with the Latins to stop Nicaean expansion in Thrace, only to return to his alliance with Nicaea before the end of the year. His father-in-law's tactical moves convinced Theodore that he could not fully trust the Bulgarians\u2014a view he held for the rest of his life.\nTheodore took philosophy classes from a most renowned teacher, Nikephoros Blemmydes. As Blemmydes was the \"hegumenos\" (abbot) of a monastery at Ephesus, Theodore attended his classes while he was staying in his father's winter palace at nearby Nymphaion. Blemmydes' zealous Aristotelianism had a strong impact on Theodore, who often mentioned Aristotelian notions, like potentiality and actuality, in his writings. Blemmydes was accused of embezzlement by one of his students early in the 1240s. Although Vatatzes' intervention saved him from imprisonment, he abandoned teaching. Theodore continued to visit Blemmydes regularly and maintained a correspondence with him. A young scholar, George Akropolites, replaced Blemmydes as Theodore's principal tutor. Born in Constantinople, Akropolites had firsthand experience with the Latin rule in the city. He completed Theodore's education in logic and mathematics. Also a historian, Akropolites would complete the most detailed chronicle of the Empire of Nicaea.\nTheodore's mother died late in 1239. Vatatzes remarried in late summer of 1240, taking an illegitimate daughter of Frederick\u00a0II, Holy Roman Emperor (r.\u20091220\u00a0\u2013\u00a01250), Constanza, whose name was changed to Anna. She was around ten and Vatatzes started a scandalous affair with one of her Italian ladies-in-waiting, named Marchesina. She was granted the right to wear purple shoes and to harness her horse with purple trappings, like the Emperor's closest relatives.\nYouth.\nFirst administrative tasks.\nIf Vatatzes followed the practice of his predecessors, Theodore was proclaimed co-ruler while still a child. In his history, Akropolites mentioned Theodore as a co-emperor when narrating events that occurred from 1235 to 1237 and in 1242. In his correspondence, Theodore referred to himself as \"my imperial majesty\" from around 1242. He was not crowned during his father's lifetime\u2014a likely explanation for the denial of his co-emperorship by two later Byzantine historians, George Pachymeres and Nicephorus Gregoras. Theodore's authority was considerable: he granted estates and salaries and intervened in legal disputes. On Blemmydes' petition, he ordered Nikephoros, the metropolitan bishop of Ephesus, to return an allegedly unlawfully purchased piece of land to Blemmydes' monastery. During his father's absence, he presided over sessions of the privy council and proposed candidates to vacant Church offices.\nJohn\u00a0III Vatatzes again laid siege to Constantinople in May 1241, but he quickly realized he could not capture the city. He started peace negotiations, and Theodore accompanied his father to the meetings with the Latin envoys. They signed a two-year truce on 24\u00a0June. Ivan\u00a0II Asen died in the same month and his death weakened Bulgaria. Vatatzes launched a military campaign against the Bulgarians' Epirote allies late in 1241. Before departing for the military campaign, he appointed Theodore his lieutenant in Asia Minor. Theodore, like his father and grandfather, held an itinerant court and visited most Nicaean towns and villages in Anatolia.\nAt this time, a Mongol general, Baiju, invaded Nicaea's eastern neighbor, the Seljuk Sultanate of Rum, from the east and captured Erzurum. Theodore informed his father, who was besieging Thessalonica, but Vatatzes did not abandon the siege. His persistence was rewarded when the ruler of Thessalonica John Komnenos Doukas (r.\u20091237\u00a0\u2013\u00a01244) renounced the title of emperor in return for the Byzantine court title of despot from Vatatzes. The Mongols launched a new military campaign against the Seljuks and routed Sultan Kaykhusraw\u00a0II (r.\u20091237\u00a0\u2013\u00a01246) at the Battle of K\u00f6se Da\u011f on 26\u00a0June 1243. After the Seljuks agreed to pay a yearly tribute to the Mongols, Nicaea remained the only Anatolian state that preserved full independence. The fear of a Mongol invasion became a constant element of Nicaean diplomacy.\nVatatzes again charged Theodore with the administration of Asia Minor when he launched a new military campaign in Thrace in 1246. After Vatatzes captured Serres, the leading citizens of Thessalonica did not risk a prolonged siege. They opened the gates of their city and paid voluntary homage to Vatatzes. As most Macedonian towns followed their example, Vatatzes almost doubled his empire's territory.\nFriends and critics.\nTheodore forged a bond of close friendship with a circle of young intellectuals. All born after the Latin conquest of Constantinople, they did not experience the shock of exile, unlike many of their fathers' \"humiliated generation\" (as Patriarch Germanus\u00a0II of Constantinople referred to them). His friends' companionship helped Theodore come through his periods of melancholy, likely caused by anxiety over his public duties. His closest friend, George Mouzalon, was a page in his retinue during their childhood. The three Mouzalon brothers\u2014George, Theodore and Andronikos\u2014were, in Blemmydes's words, \"of despicably low birth\", but they were talented singers and musicians. Most of Theodore's other confidants, like Joseph Mesopotamites and Konstas Hagiotheodorites, were related to high-ranking officials and churchmen.\nHis fellows often teased Theodore for his style of reasoning during philosophical discussions. His friends' mockery upset him but critical remarks made by bishops and aristocrats were more dangerous to his reputation. Metropolitan Nikephoros of Ephesus rebuked him for his pride and for his non-observance of the rules of fasting. The governor of Thessalonica, Theodore Philes, circulated defamatory poems about Theodore's alleged affair with an unnamed woman. Philes's accusations reached the ears of Blemmydes, and Theodore could not convince his former tutor of his innocence. Blemmydes did not tolerate sexual misconduct, and completed a mirror for princes (instruction), entitled \"Imperial Statue\", warning both Theodore and his father against lechery. On the other hand, Theodore often made fun of bishops for their self-aggrandizement, their barbaric speech or ignorantly heretical statements, or even for their physical appearance.\nTowards sole rule.\nVatatzes was making preparations for a new attack on Constantinople in the spring of 1252, but the ruler of Epirus, Michael\u00a0II Komnenos Doukas (r.\u20091230\u00a0\u2013\u00a01266/68), invaded Nicaean territory in Macedonia. Vatatzes appointed Theodore his viceroy in Asia Minor and launched a counter-attack against Michael\u00a0II, forcing him to return to Epirus. Elena of Bulgaria died unexpectedly of unknown causes before the end of August. Theodore mourned his wife for more than the customary forty days. He abandoned fasting and wearing black only on his father's command. His wife's death intensified Theodore's melancholy. He secluded himself in the palace and dedicated his time to philosophical studies and writing. He only resumed his regular visits to the towns of Asia Minor in 1253.\nEarly in 1253, Emperor Frederick\u00a0II's son and successor, Conrad (r.\u20091250\u00a0\u2013\u00a01254), forced most relatives of his father's mistress, Bianca Lancia, into exile. They fled to Nicaea and sought asylum from Bianca's daughter, Empress Constanza-Anna. Since his father was staying in Thrace, the exiles were received by Theodore. Conrad changed his mind and sent the erudite Berthold of Hohenburg, an in-law of the Lancias, to Nicaea to begin negotiations with them. While waiting for his father's return from Thrace, Theodore had philosophical conversations with Hohenburg. The study of ancient Greek philosophers had intensified in Europe, and Hohenburg asked Theodore for Greek philosophical works. This request reinforced Theodore's pride in the Greeks' ancient heritage, and he decided to publish his own works.\nVatatzes returned to Nicaea in the winter of 1253. Early in 1254, he fell ill suddenly and never fully recovered. His illness made Theodore the actual ruler of the empire. Vatatzes was still alive when news of the Mongols' preparations for a new invasion of Asia Minor reached Nicaea.\nReign.\nAccession.\nJohn\u00a0III Vatatzes died in Nicaea on 4\u00a0November 1254, leaving a flourishing empire to Theodore. Theodore was acclaimed emperor, but he was not crowned because the patriarchal throne was vacant. In his funerary speech at Vatatzes' burial, Akropolites expressed his hope that Theodore would lead the Nicaeans to expel the Latins from Constantinople, comparing him with the \"pillar of fire\" of the Book of Exodus, guiding the Israelites. Theodore could not risk launching an attack against Constantinople, because his empire was surrounded by hostile powers.\nTheodore forbade his father's widow, Anna-Constanza, from returning to her Sicilian homeland. This act outraged her brother, Manfred (r.\u20091258\u00a0\u2013\u00a01266), who had recently assumed power in the Kingdom of Sicily. Theodore had a meeting with the Seljuk Sultan of Rum, Kaykaus\u00a0II (r.\u20091246\u00a0\u2013\u00a01262), in Philadelphia. They concluded a defensive alliance against the Mongols. Kaykaus had acknowledged the Mongols' suzerainty, but had not visited the court of Great Khan M\u00f6ngke to pay homage to him.\nTheodore wanted to make Blemmydes the new patriarch, but his old tutor refused. His next candidate, a hermit with an aristocratic background, Arsenios Autoreianos, accepted the offer. The new patriarch crowned and anointed Theodore emperor\u2014on Christmas 1254. According to sources hostile to Arsenios, he was Theodore's sole nominee to the patriarchal throne although tradition required the presentation of three candidates to the electors. Arsenios's allegedly irregular appointment would give rise to the conflict known as the \"Arsenite Schism\", lasting from 1265 to 1310. Arsenios was always Theodore's loyal supporter and obeyed his commands.\nTheodore did not trust the aristocrats and wrote of \"illicit love affairs and very unjust plots\", without naming his opponents, in a letter addressed to George Mouzalon in December 1254. The historian Michael Angold proposes that Emperor Frederick\u00a0II's similar policy may have inspired Theodore's \"more autocratic stance towards his aristocracy\". Theodore appointed George Mouzalon to be the new (or commander-in-chief) of the mobile army. George's brother, Andronikos, was designated as the new \"protovestiarites\" (commander of the guards of the imperial palace). Theodore also demonstrated his favor towards a general of common origin, Constantine Margarites. He offered offices to some aristocrats who had been put aside during his father's reign. He recalled his mother's uncles, Michael and Manuel Laskaris, from their exile and made two members of the rebellious Nestongos family, George and Isaac, generals. His appointments offended most aristocrats.\nWars with Bulgaria.\nThe young Bulgarian Tzar, Michael\u00a0II Asen (r.\u20091246\u00a0\u2013\u00a01256/57), took advantage of Vatatzes' death to reconquer the lands he had seized from Bulgaria after 1241. Michael invaded Macedonia and Thrace in December 1254 or January 1255. Most Nicaean garrisons in the local fortresses were small, and the local Bulgarians supported the invaders. The Bulgarians quickly seized most Thracian fortresses. Two Macedonian towns, Veles and Skopje, also surrendered to them. A hastily summoned council of war accepted George Mouzalon's proposal of an immediate counter-attack. Theodore decided to lead the campaign himself, and entrusted Mouzalon with the administration of Asia Minor in February 1255. His surprise attack forced the invaders to withdraw from Thrace, and he ordered two Nicaean aristocrats, Alexios Strategopoulos and Demetrios Tornikes, to pursue the Bulgarians. The two generals led their troops across the passes of the Rhodope Mountains in constant fear of an ambush. When they unexpectedly heard the sounds of the horns of shepherds and swineherds, they retreated in a panic, abandoning their baggage. The fiasco outraged Theodore, and he ordered them to hurry to his camp at Adrianople, but both commanders disobeyed.\nA Bulgarian renegade in Nicaean service, Dragotas, switched sides and laid siege to Melnik in the summer. Theodore hastily departed from Adrianople to lead relief forces to the town. The Bulgarians laid an ambush for him along the Rupel Pass, but he avoided it and Dragotas abandoned the siege on Theodore's arrival. From Melnik, Theodore went to Thessalonica and dismissed his old opponent, Philes, from the governorship. Theodore closed down the local mint, because he wanted to establish a centralized system of financial administration in Asia Minor, with a new treasury at Astritzion on the Asian coast of the Hellespont. He invaded Macedonia and forced the Bulgarian garrison in Veles to surrender, but drought prevented him from continuing the military campaign across the arid Ov\u010de Pole. He went to Serres, where he confirmed the fiscal privileges of the Macedonian towns. He also ordered the arrest of Constantine Kabasilas, Archbishop of Ohrid, assuming that Kabasilas was Michael\u00a0II of Epirus' loyal supporter.\nA report of a Mongol invasion of Asia Minor forced Theodore to leave Macedonia in late autumn of 1255. After the report had proved false, he launched an attack against the fortress of Tzepaina. He had to abandon the campaign, because his army could not pass across the narrow and frosty mountain passes. He returned to Anatolia around the end of the year. He showered his confidants with honors and gifts. He made Manuel Laskaris and Constantine Margarites the commanders-in-chief of his troops in Thrace and charged George Mouzalon with implementing military reforms. In parallel, he turned against members of the old aristocratic families whom he distrusted. Constantine Strategopoulos and Theodore Philes\u2014two aristocrats who had offended him\u2014were blinded. Alexios Strategopoulos and Alexios Raoul's four sons were imprisoned. Theodore's cousin, Michael Palaiologos, fled to the Seljuks to escape imprisonment. Theodore took advantage of the emperors' right to control aristocratic marriages to establish family ties between his lowborn favorites and the old aristocracy. George Mouzalon married Palaiologos' niece, Theodora Kantakouzene Palaiologina, Andronikos Mouzalon wed a daughter of Alexios Raoul.\nTheodore decided to resume negotiations about a church union between the Orthodox Nicaean and the Catholic Churches with Pope Alexander\u00a0IV (r.\u20091254\u00a0\u2013\u00a01261) and sent envoys to Rome in April or May 1256. Divergent views on the procession of the Holy Spirit had always been an important cause of the schism between the two Churches. Orthodox theologians maintained that the Holy Spirit proceeded from the Father alone, but Catholic theologians stated that the Holy Spirit proceeded from the Father \"and the Son\". Theodore commissioned Blemmydes to summarize the Orthodox position. Blemmydes adopted a conciliatory approach, concluding that a statement about the procession of the Holy Spirit from the Father through the Son was fully in conformity with the Bible and the Church Fathers' works. Theodore did not accept his tutor's view and insisted on the traditional Orthodox doctrine.\nMichael\u00a0II of Bulgaria dispatched Cuman raiders to plunder Thrace early in 1256. Although Theodore had instructed Laskaris and Margarites to adopt a defensive strategy, they pursued the Cumans, but the invaders inflicted a heavy defeat on their troops. Theodore assembled a new army, partially mustered among the Anatolian peasantry, and crossed the Hellespont. He sent troops, including Cuman horsemen in his service, against the invaders and they routed the enemy forces in two battles in Thrace. He entered into peace negotiations with Michael\u00a0II with the mediation of Rostislav Mikhailovich, Duke of Macs\u00f3 (r.\u20091254\u00a0\u2013\u00a01262). Michael\u00a0II had recently married Rostislav's daughter, and Rostislav's wife, Anna of Hungary, was Theodore's cousin. Rostislav came to Thrace to reach an agreement with Theodore. Akropolites drafted a treaty about the restoration of the prewar boundaries between Nicaea and Bulgaria. Rostislav accepted it and signed the peace treaty on Michael\u00a0II's behalf on 29\u00a0June. The treaty prescribed that Michael\u00a0II cede Tzepaina to the Nicaeans, but the Bulgarian garrison was not withdrawn immediately from the fortress. Theodore became convinced that Rostislav had deceived him and ordered the public whipping of Akropolites. His act proved imprudent, because the Bulgarians ceded the fortress in early September. Theodore sent George Mouzalon to Akropolites to seek a reconciliation.\nThe peace treaty aroused much indignation in Bulgaria, enabling Michael\u00a0II's cousin, Kaliman (r. 1256), to stage a plot and dethrone the Tzar. Kaliman seized the throne, but he never gained the support of the army. After Kaliman fell victim to a new plot, Rostislav Mikhailovich and Michael\u00a0II's brother-in-law, Mitso (r.\u20091256\u00a0\u2013\u00a01257), laid claim to the throne. Most boyars (noblemen) preferred a third candidate, one of their number, Konstantin Tih (r.\u20091257\u00a0\u2013\u00a01277), although he was not related to the ruling Asen dynasty.\nExpansion.\nTheodore's war against Bulgaria brought about a rapprochement between Epirus and Serbia. Michael\u00a0II of Epirus made a formal alliance with Stefan Uro\u0161\u00a0I, King of Serbia (r.\u20091243\u00a0\u2013\u00a01276). He also sent gifts to the Albanian chiefs who had acknowledged Nicaean suzerainty to gain their support. Theodore's daughter, Maria, and Michael\u00a0II's son and heir, Nikephoros (r.\u20091266/68\u00a0\u2013\u00a01296/98), had been engaged during Vatatzes' reign. After making peace with the Bulgarians, Theodore ordered Michael\u00a0II to send Nikephoros to Thessalonica to wed Maria. Nikephoros was accompanied by his mother, Theodora Petraliphaina. Theodore took her into custody, only allowing her to return to Epirus after Michael\u00a0II ceded Servia and Dyrrachium to him. The possession of the two towns secured the Nicaean control of the Via Egnatia, but Michael\u00a0II remained hostile to Theodore.\nTheodore received the papal legate, Bishop Constantine of Orvieto, in Thessalonica. Their negotiations about the church union and a new ecumenical council\u2014a general assembly of Orthodox and Catholic bishops\u2014proved fruitless, because the legate's authorization to make concessions was limited and Theodore was unwilling to make theological concessions. He also preserved the right to convoke the Orthodox bishops to a synod to discuss the conditions of the union. Theodore maintained a correspondence with the Holy See, but he did not initiate new negotiations with it.\nThe Mongols invaded Asia Minor and defeated Kaykaus\u00a0II on 14\u00a0October 1256. Theodore hurried back to Anatolia to oversee the preparations for its defense. Kaykaus sought asylum in Nicaea and the Mongols installed his brother, Kilij Arslan\u00a0IV (r.\u20091246/49\u00a0\u2013\u00a01266), as the new sultan of Rum. Theodore assembled his troops on the plains near Magnesia. The Mongol ruler of Persia, the Ilkhan H\u00fclag\u00fc (r.\u20091256\u00a0\u2013\u00a01265), sent a delegation to Theodore to begin negotiations about Kaykaus' future. H\u00fcleg\u00fc agreed to withdraw his army from Rum and ordered the division of the sultanate between Kaykaus and Kilij Arslan in the spring of 1257. Before leaving for Rum, Kaykaus ceded four fortresses in the valley of the river Lycus to Nicaea in return for a contingent of 300 auxiliary troops. His achievements made Theodore self-confident. He proudly stated that his empire included territories as far as Dyrrachium on the Adriatic Sea and Cape Karambis on the Black Sea. His success during the war against Bulgaria had convinced him he should recruit soldiers from among Anatolian peasants. In a letter to Blemmydes, he stated that the native \"Hellenes\" were more reliable than foreign mercenaries.\nIllness and death.\nTheodore fell seriously ill in November 1257. George Pachymeres, who was less than sixteen years old at the time, would diagnose his illness as epilepsy, mentioning that Theodore had often lost consciousness and \"collapsed to the ground\". Pachymeres also described Theodore's unusual appointments and his attempts to forge marriage alliances between aristocrats and commoners as symptoms of his disease. Akropolites only noticed extreme weight loss, reducing Theodore's entire body to a skeleton; Blemmydes described Theodore's illness as \"a scourge and a strange disease\", also mentioning Theodore's melancholy and phobias. Theodore himself wrote of insufferable aching and paralysis in the arms. Modern historians of diseases have not agreed on a diagnosis of Theodore's illness. The medical historian John Lascaratos and the neurologist Panaghiotis Zis maintain that Pachymeres' diagnosis was correct, concluding that Theodore developed epilepsy of the tonic-clonic type in his late twenties. The historian Donald M. Nicol proposes that Theodore's illness \"made him the prey of his moods, and he compensated for his nervousness by an autocratic and obstinate temper\". The medical historian Georgios Makris concludes in his 1995 study on epilepsy in the Byzantine Empire that Theodore did not have epilepsy. The historian Dimiter Angelov, who does not accept Pachymeres' diagnosis, proposes that Theodore's symptoms\u2014fits and loss of balance\u2014indicate that he had cancer of the brain, the spine, or the lungs.\nTheodore's illness prevented him from commanding his troops in person. The commanders of the army in Macedonia, most of them of humble origin, recently appointed by Theodore, could not prevent the Epirotes, Albanians and Serbians from raiding Nicaean territories. Stefan Uro\u0161\u00a0I defeated the Nicaean troops near Prilep. Michael\u00a0II's sister-in-law, Maria Petraliphaina, entered into a correspondence with Theodore's commander, Constantine Chabaron, making him believe that she was eager to marry him, but Chabaron was captured during their meeting. Theodore's newly assembled army of Anatolian peasants was routed at Edessa. Michael Palaiologos, who had been allowed to return from his exile, led a new army to Macedonia. He defeated the Epirotes, but Theodore ordered him to return instead of marching to Prilep. Palaiologos' withdrawal enabled Michael\u00a0II to seize Prilep and capture Akropolites, who was its governor. Michael\u00a0II was planning to launch an attack against Thessalonica, but Manfred of Sicily renewed his predecessors' claim to Byzantine territories in the Balkans and invaded Epirus from the west. Michael\u00a0II, who did not want to abandon his plan, concluded an alliance with Manfred who expelled the Nicaean garrisons from Dyrrachium and other fortresses on the Adriatic by the end of February 1258.\nKonstantin Tih of Bulgaria repudiated his first wife and sued for the hand of Theodore's eldest daughter, Irene. He knew that his marriage to Irene, who was Tzar Ivan Asen\u00a0II's granddaughter, could strengthen his claim to rule. Theodore wanted to confirm his peace treaty with Bulgaria and accepted Konstantin Tih's offer. Irene went to Bulgaria to marry Konstantin Tih.\nTheodore rarely left his palace at Magnesia during the last months of his life. He was convinced that sorcery caused his illness and accused his courtiers of casting spells on him, sending many of them for trial. Michael Palaiologos's sister, Maria-Martha, was the most famous victim of Theodore's paranoia. Theodore had forced her daughter, Theodora, to marry the elderly Basil Kaballarios, but the marriage was never consummated. After Kaballarios had attributed his impotence to his mother-in-law's spells, Theodore had her put into a sack filled with cats that tore her flesh. She was only released because Theodore suddenly panicked, fearing her spells. Also fearing her brother's revenge, Theodore had Michael Palaiologos imprisoned on charges of poisoning, but soon set him free. The dying emperor named his seven-year-old son, John (r.\u20091254\u00a0\u2013\u00a01261), as his sole heir, appointing George Mouzalon regent until John came of age. Theodore became a monk, but he kept his baptismal name. He summarized his sins in a treatise and asked the patriarchal synod to grant him absolution. He died in the imperial palace at Magnesia on 16\u00a0August 1258. He was buried next to his father in the Sosandra monastery on Mount Sipylus. His grave and the monastery were destroyed after the Turkish conquest of the region in the 14th\u00a0century.\nThe aristocrats had taken an oath of loyalty to Mouzalon at Theodore's deathbed, but they soon began conspiring against him. In ten days, Mouzalon was murdered, and Michael Palaiologos assumed the regency for the child-emperor, John\u00a0IV Laskaris. Palaiologos convinced the aristocrats that an empire ruled by a boy could not resist enemy attacks, and he was proclaimed co-emperor as Michael\u00a0VIII (r.\u20091259\u00a0\u2013\u00a01282) before the end of the year. When Michael\u00a0VIII and John\u00a0IV were crowned together early in 1259, the Patriarch put the crown first on Michael\u00a0VIII's head. After concluding an agreement with Genoa against the Latin Empire, he dispatched Alexios Strategopoulos to spy on the defences of Constantinople. Taking advantage of the absence of the bulk of the Latin army, Strategopoulos seized Constantinople by a surprise attack on 25\u00a0July 1261. Michael\u00a0VIII was crowned for the second time, alone, in the Hagia Sophia. The child John\u00a0IV was blinded on 25\u00a0December 1261, which prevented him from ruling. To emphasize that the Laskaris family had lost their imperial status, Michael\u00a0VIII married off John's three sisters to minor Italian and Bulgarian noblemen.\nScholarship.\nA man of letters devoted to philosophical and theological studies, Theodore transformed his court into a center for renowned scholars shortly after his accession to the throne. He ordered that books which he and his father had collected in urban libraries be made available to all who wanted to read them. During his father's lifetime he began to write treatises on philosophical, theological and historical subjects, but decided to prepare manuscript editions of his works only after his meeting with Berthold of Hohenburg in 1253. They were collected in four codices, but only three survived.\nTheodore's \"Satire of the Tutor\", written most likely in 1240, is his earliest extant work. The satire is dedicated to his principal tutor, portraying him as an under-educated and rude man, who learned magic while staying in Bulgaria. He also wrote encomia in praise of the citizens of Nicaea, his father and Akropolites. Theodore's theological works\u2014including his \"First Oration against the Latins, or, on the Procession of the Holy Spirit\", and his treatise \"On the Trinity\"\u2014demonstrate his adherence to Orthodox theology. Theodore's \"Great Supplicatory Canon to Our Lady\", a supplicatory canon to the Virgin Mary, is his best known work. He composed it just months before his death and it is still sung in Orthodox ceremonies.\nFamily.\nNeither Theodore nor Elena had reached the minimum legal age of marriage\u2014fourteen for boys and twelve for girls\u2014when they were married, but such an early marriage was not unique among Nicaean aristocrats and commoners. The wedding took place at Lampsakos in early 1235. Years later, Theodore described Elena as the flower of his youth and stated that their \"bond of incomparable love\" made them \"happier than all people\". She gave birth to four or five daughters, and one son. Their children were:\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He was succeeded by his son, known as Theodore II Doukas Laskaris.\nLife.\nJohn Doukas Vatatzes, born c.\u20091192 in Didymoteicho, was probably the son of the general Basil Vatatzes, who was killed in battle in 1194, and his wife, a cousin of the Emperors Isaac II Angelos and Alexios III Angelos. John Doukas Vatatzes had two older brothers. The eldest was Isaac Doukas Vatatzes (1188\u20131261), while his younger brother died at a young age. Through his marriage to Eudokia Angelina he fathered Theodora Doukaina Vatatzaina, who later married Michael VIII Palaiologos. The middle brother's name is unknown, but his daughter married the \"protovestiarios\" Alexios Raoul.\nA successful soldier from a military family, John had risen to the position of protovestiarites when he was chosen c.\u20091216 by Emperor Theodore I Komnenos Laskaris as the second husband for his daughter Irene Laskarina, following the death of her first husband, Andronikos Palaiologos. As husband of Laskaris' firstborn, who had no son of his own, John may have been the \"de facto\" heir to the throne, though the question of succession was left open; Laskaris may have hoped his own marriage to Maria of Courtenay in 1219 would produce a male heir. As a result, when John III became emperor in December 1221, following Theodore I's death in November,\n he had to suppress opposition to his rule by Laskaris' brothers, Alexios and Isaac. The struggle ended with the Battle of Poimanenon in 1224, in which his opponents were defeated in spite of support from the Latin Empire of Constantinople. John III's victory led to territorial concessions by the Latin Empire in 1225, followed by John's incursion into Europe, where he seized Adrianople.\nJohn III's possession of Adrianople was terminated by Theodore Komnenos Doukas of Epirus and Thessalonica, who drove the Nicaean garrison out of Adrianople and annexed much of Thrace in 1227. The elimination of Theodore by Ivan Asen II of Bulgaria in 1230 put an end to the danger posed by Thessalonica, and John III made an alliance with Bulgaria against the Latin Empire.\nIn 1235 this alliance resulted in the restoration of the Bulgarian patriarchate and the marriage between Elena of Bulgaria and Theodore II, respectively Ivan Asen II's daughter and John III's son. In that same year, the Bulgarians and Nicaeans campaigned against the Latin Empire, and in 1236 they attempted a siege of Constantinople. Subsequently, Ivan Asen II adopted an ambivalent policy, effectively becoming neutral and leaving John III to his own devices.\nJohn III Vatatzes was greatly interested in the collection and copying of manuscripts, and William of Rubruck reports that he owned a copy of the missing books from Ovid's \"Fasti\". Rubruck was critical of the Hellenic traditions he encountered in the Empire of Nicaea, specifically the feast day for Saint Felicity favored by John Vatatzes, which Friedrich Risch suggests would have been the \"Felicitanalia\", practiced by Sulla to venerate Felicitas in the 1st century with an emphasis on inverting social norms, extolling truth and beauty, reciting profane and satirical verse and wearing ornamented \"cenatoria\", or dinner robes during the day.\nIn spite of some reverses against the Latin Empire in 1240, John III was able to take advantage of Ivan Asen II's death in 1241 to impose his own suzerainty over Thessalonica (in 1242), and later to annex this city, as well as much of Bulgarian Thrace in 1246. By 1247 he had established an effective stranglehold on Constantinople. In the last years of his reign Nicaean authority extended far to the west, where John III attempted to contain the expansion of Epirus. Michael's allies Golem of Kruja and Theodore Petraliphas defected to John III in 1252.\nJohn III died in Nymphaion in 1254, and was buried in the monastery of Sosandra, which he had founded, in the region of Magnesia.\nAlliance with Frederick II.\nIn an attempt to save the ailing Latin empire after the joint Nicaean-Bulgarian siege of Constantinople in 1236, Pope Gregory IX called for a crusade against Nicaea and wrote to John III in 1237 informing him of the impending crusader army. In the face of Bulgarian neutrality, John III sought allies elsewhere, turning to the Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II von Hohenstaufen. Frederick II was the most powerful in Europe and had become the hated enemy of the papacy, having already been excommunicated by Gregory IX in 1227. In a letter composed sometime before his second excommunication in 1239, Frederick II wrote to John III lamenting the power of the pope in the west and praising John III for the power of the Byzantine emperor over the clergy.\nWarm relations between the two Roman empires had already begun after the Sixth Crusade (1228\u20131229), undertaken by Frederick II to lift his first excommunication, when Frederick II received a Nicaean embassy bringing gold coins, gold-embroidered silk and horses, among other gifts. By 1238, the two emperors had concluded an alliance. Frederick II agreed to recognize John III as the legitimate Byzantine emperor, albeit with the title \"Emperor of the Greeks\" (\"Grecorum imperator /\" \u0393\u03c1\u03b1\u03b9\u03ba\u1ff6\u03bd \u03b2\u03b1\u03c3\u03b9\u03bb\u03b5\u03cd\u03c2), in exchange for mutual aid. That same year, John III sent Nicaean troops to participate in the Siege of Brescia and Frederick II forestalled Gregory IX's crusade headed by the Latin emperor Baldwin II in north Italy, forcing the crusaders to eventually take the overland route to Constantinople in 1239.\nIn early 1240, John III's wife Irene Lascarina died, and later that year John III married Frederick II's 10-year-old daughter Constance II of Hohenstaufen to cement their alliance, who took the Greek name Anna. Despite the lack of children from the marriage and John III's affair with his wife's lady-in-waiting, the alliance between the two emperors continued until Frederick II's death in 1250.\nAfter Gregory IX's death in 1241, the new pope Innocent IV continued the policies of his predecessor, and attempted to wage war on both emperors. At the Council of Lyon in 1245, Frederick was declared deposed as emperor and excommunicated, for, among a multitude of other reasons, marrying his daughter to John III who was called by Innocent IV \"that enemy of God and the church.\" The illegal papal deposition of Frederick II was widely regarded as illegitimate and now European monarch offered support for Innocent\u2019s anti-Staufen crusade. Frederick remained the preeminent monarch in the west. In the east, the pope called for another crusade against John III and entered into negotiations with the Mongols to invade Nicaea, but both efforts were unsuccessful. In the west, Innocent IV was more successful against Frederick II, and a papal-supported rebellion defeated the imperial army at the Battle of Parma in 1248. However, this and other setbacks notwithstanding, the situation remained fluid and Frederick managed to maintain his dominance in Italy. John III continued to send troops, including archers and infantryman, and subsidies to Frederick via Epirus between 1247 and 1250 to aid his father-in-law, who finally checked papal forces in central Italy at the Battle of Cingoli in August 1250 and avenged his reversals in Lombardy. His anti-imperial crusade seemingly crumbling, Innocent\u2019s position in Lyon was dire. During 1250, Frederick had mostly recovered from his recent setbacks and enjoyed relative imperial ascendancy across Italy; however, the great Hohenstaufen emperor died of dysentery in December of that year.\nAfter Frederick II's death, diplomatic activity briefly continued between the two empires, with John III's son Theodore II Doukas Laskaris delivering a memorial speech in which he admired Frederick II's struggle against the hostility of the western aristocracy and clergy. Frederick's son and successor Conrad IV sent an embassy to Nicaea in 1253 in order to return Constance-Anna's exiled family back to Italy, but Conrad IV and John III's deaths in 1254 ensured that a possible continuation of the imperial alliance never ensued; after Conrad's IV death, the Holy Roman Empire and the Kingdom of Sicily were divided. Frederick's other son Manfred, the last Hohenstaufen king of Sicily, was to prove hostile to the Nicaean cause, invading Nicaea's Albanian coast in 1257 and allying with Michael II Komnenos Doukas against Nicaea in 1259, providing troops for the Battle of Pelagonia. After the Nicaean victory, Michael VIII Palaiologos attempted to marry the widowed Constance-Anna, who had remained at the Nicaean court during the reigns of her stepson and stepgrandson, in order to secure an alliance with Manfred. However, Constance-Anna refused and moved to her brother's court in Sicily in 1261, thus severing all ties with Byzantium and formally ending the alliance started by John III and Frederick II.\nFamily.\nJohn III Doukas Vatatzes married first Irene Lascarina, the daughter of his predecessor Theodore I Komnenos Laskaris in 1212. They had one son, the future Theodore II Doukas Laskaris. Irene fell from a horse and was so badly injured that she was unable to have any more children.\nIrene retired to a convent, taking the monastic name Eugenia, and died there in summer of 1240.John III married as his second wife Constance II of Hohenstaufen, an illegitimate daughter of Emperor Frederick II by his mistress Bianca Lancia. They had no children.\nLegacy.\nJohn III Doukas Vatatzes was a successful ruler who laid the groundwork for Nicaea's recovery of Constantinople. He was successful in maintaining generally peaceful relations with his most powerful neighbors, Bulgaria and the Sultanate of Rum, and his network of diplomatic relations extended to the Holy Roman Empire and the Papacy. Among the armed forces he used were the large Cuman communities he had settled to guard Western Anatolia against invasions by Oghuz-Turkmens.\nJohn III effected Nicaean expansion into Europe, where by the end of his reign he had annexed his former rival Thessalonica and had expanded at the expense of Bulgaria and Epirus. He also expanded Nicaean control over much of the Aegean and annexed the important island of Rhodes, while he supported initiatives to free Crete from Venetian occupation aiming toward its re-unification with the Byzantine empire of Nicaea. Styling himself the true inheritor of the Roman Empire, John III encouraged justice and charity, and provided active leadership in both peace and war despite his epilepsy. He carefully developed the internal prosperity and commerce of his realm, which became known for bountiful harvest festivals reportedly drawing on traditions from the Felicitas feast days described in the missing 11th book of Ovid's Book of Days.\nA half-century after his death, John III was canonized as a saint, under the name John Vatatzes the Merciful and is commemorated annually on 4 November. George Akropolites mentions that the people saw to the construction of a temple in his honour in Nymphaeum, and that his cult as a saint quickly spread to the people of western Asia Minor. On the same day, since 2010, the \"Vatatzeia\" festival is organized at Didymoteicho by the local metropolitan bishop. Alice Gardiner remarked on the persistence of John's cult among the Ionian Greeks as late as the early 20th century, and on the contrast she witnessed where \"the clergy and people of Magnesia and the neighbourhood revere his memory every fourth of November. But those who ramble and play about his ruined palace seldom connect it even with his name.\"\nHis feast day is formally an Eastern Orthodox holiday, although it is not commemorated with any special liturgy; there are two known historical \"akolouthiai\" for him, including an 1874 copy of an older Magnesian \"menaion\" for the month of November, which shows that in the 15th and 16th century, he was venerated as \"the holy glorious equal of the Apostles and emperor John Vatatzes, the new almsgiver in Magnesia.\" The relevant hymns are preserved in only one known manuscript in the library of the Leimonos monastery on Lesbos, Greece, and include references to the feast day for the almsgiver John Vatatzes. John III Vatatzes' feast day has largely fallen out of favor other than in the church dedicated to him in his birth city of Didymoteicho.\nThe generations after John Vatatzes looked back upon him as \"the Father of the Greeks.\" It is also the case that many in the religious and academic community consider John Vatatzes to be the best candidate for the identity of the \"Marble Emperor\" in direct contrast with those who claim that Constantine XI is in fact the legendary reposed king.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\nPrimary.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSecondary.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "74222", "revid": "50403594", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=74222", "title": "Presbyter", "text": "Christian cleric\nPresbyter () is an honorific title for Christian clergy. The word derives from the Greek \"presbyteros\", which means elder or senior, although many in Christian antiquity understood \"presbyteros\" to refer to the bishop functioning as overseer. The word \"presbyter\" is used many times in the New Testament, referring both to the Jewish leadership and the \"tradition of the elders\", and to the leaders of the early Christian community.\nIn modern Catholic, Orthodox and Anglican usage, \"presbyter\" is distinct from \"bishop:\" in Roman Catholicism it means \"Catholic priest\". In other Protestant usage, for example, Methodism, \"presbyter\" does not refer to a member of a distinctive priesthood called \"priests\" but rather to a minister, pastor, or elder.\nEtymology.\nThe word \"presbyter\" etymologically derives from Greek \"\u03c0\u03c1\u03b5\u03c3\u03b2\u03cd\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2\" (\"presbyteros\"), the comparative form of \"\u03c0\u03c1\u03ad\u03c3\u03b2\u03c5\u03c2\" (\"presbys\"), \"old man\". However, while the English word priest has presbyter as the etymological origin, the distinctive Greek word (Greek \u1f31\u03b5\u03c1\u03b5\u03cd\u03c2 \"hiereus\") for \"priest\" is never used for presbyteros/episkopos in the New Testament, except as being part of the general priesthood of all believers, with the first Christians making a distinction between pagan and Jewish priests and New Testament presbyters.\nHistory.\nThe earliest organization of the Church in Jerusalem was according to most scholars similar to that of Jewish synagogues, but it had a council or college of ordained presbyters ( \"elders).\" In Acts 11:30 and , we see a collegiate system of government in Jerusalem though headed by James, according to tradition the first bishop of the city. In , the Apostle Paul ordains presbyters in the churches he founded.\nThe term presbyter was often not yet clearly distinguished from the term overseer (\u1f10\u03c0\u03af\u03c3\u03ba\u03bf\u03c0\u03bf\u03b9 \"episkopoi\", later exclusively used as meaning bishop), as in , Titus 1:5\u20137 and 1 Peter 5:1. The earliest writings of the Apostolic Fathers, the Didache and the First Epistle of Clement for example, show the church used two terms for local church offices\u2014presbyters (seen by many as an interchangeable term with episcopos or overseer) and deacon.\nIn Timothy and Titus in the New Testament a more clearly defined episcopate can be seen. We are told that Paul had left Timothy in Ephesus and Titus in Crete to oversee the local church ( and ). Paul commands them to ordain presbyters/bishops and to exercise general oversight, telling Titus to \"rebuke with all authority\" ().\nEarly sources are not clear, but various groups of Christian communities would have had a group or college of presbyter-overseers functioning as leaders of the local churches. Occasionally women were described as presbyter on their tomb inscriptions or in other texts. Eventually, the head or \"monarchic\" bishop came to rule more clearly, and all local churches would eventually follow the example of the other churches and structure themselves after the model of the others with the one bishop in clearer charge, though the role of the body of priests remained important.\nFrom the 2nd century, it is certain that the offices of bishop and presbyter were clearly distinguished, after the death of the Apostles, there was a differentiation in the usage of the synonymous terms, giving rise to the appearance of two distinct offices, Bishop and \"presbyter\". The bishop was understood mainly as the president of the council of presbyters, and so the bishop came to be distinguished both in honor and in prerogative from the presbyters, who were seen as deriving their authority by means of delegation from the bishop. The distinction between presbyter and bishop is made fairly soon after the Apostolic period. Each Episcopal see had its own bishop and his presence was necessary to consecrate any gathering of the church.\nEventually, as Christendom grew, individual congregations were no longer directly served by a bishop. The bishop in a large city (the Metropolitan bishop) would appoint a priest to pastor the flock in each congregation, acting as his delegate.\nThe fourth century scholar Jerome (347\u2013420) stated:\nTherefore a presbyter is the same as a bishop is, and before that by the instigation of the devil emulations in respect to religion arose, and people began to say: I am of Paul, and I of Apollos, and I of Cephas, the churches were governed by the common counsel of the presbyters. But, after that each one was accustomed to regard those whom he had baptized as his own disciples and not of Christ, it was decreed in the whole world that one chosen from among the presbyters should be placed over the others ... Therefore, as presbyters may know that by the custom of the church they are subject to the one who has been placed over them; so also bishops may understand that they are greater than presbyters more by custom than by the veritable ordinance of the Lord.\nSlightly different other versions (quoting John Calvin) express the same.\nA Catholic explanation suggests that the delegates were bishops in the actual sense of the term but that they neither possessed fixed sees nor had a special title. Since they were essentially itinerant, they confided the fixed necessary functions relating to the daily life of the community to the care of some of the better-educated and highly respected converts.\nAlong with this was the title \"priest\" being distinctively ascribed to presbyters/bishops. Writer Greg Dues, author of \"Catholic Customs &amp; Traditions\", claims that\nPriesthood as we know it in the Catholic church was unheard of during the first generation of Christianity, because at that time priesthood was still associated with animal sacrifices in both the Jewish and pagan religions. ... When the Eucharist came to be regarded as a sacrifice [after Rome's theology], the role of the bishop took on a priestly dimension. By the third century bishops were considered priests. Presbyters or elders sometimes substituted for the bishop at the Eucharist. By the end of the third century people all over were using the title 'priest' (hierus in Greek and sacerdos in Latin) for whoever presided at the Eucharist.\nWith the legalization of Christianity and the threat of paganism dwindling from the passage of time, the use of the word priest was adopted from presbyter; as they felt there was no longer a chance of their faith being confused with the ideas, philosophies and culture of the Roman religion.\nModern usage.\nThe Roman Catholic Church, the Orthodox Church, the non-Chalcedonian churches, and similar groups typically refer to presbyters in English as priests (\"priest\" is etymologically derived from the Greek \"presbyteros\" via the Latin \"presbyter\"). Collectively, however, their \"college\" is referred to as the \"presbyterium\", \"presbytery\", or \"presbyterate\".\nThis usage is seen by most Protestant Christians as stripping the laity of its priestly status, while those who use the term defend its usage by saying that, while they do believe in the \"priesthood\" (Greek \u1f31\u03b5\u03c1\u03b5\u03cd\u03c2 \"hiereus\" \u2013 a different word altogether, used in Rev 1:6, 1 Pet 2:9) of all believers, they do not believe in the \"eldership\" of all believers. This is generally true of United Methodists, who ordain elders as clergy (pastors) while affirming the priesthood of all believers. The Methodist Church of Great Britain has formally referred to its presbyters as such (rather than the common title of 'minister') since 1990, from when it was possible to be ordained as a Methodist deacon, which is also an order of Methodist ministry. The evangelical (or ultra low-church) Anglican Diocese of Sydney has abolished the use of the word \"priest\" for those ordained as such. They are now referred to as \"presbyters\". Presbyterians sometimes refer to their ruling elders and teaching elders (ministers) as presbyters.\nThe website of the International Standard Version of the Bible, a Protestant translation, responds to a criticism of its use of \"elder\" over \"priest\" by stating the following:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;No Greek lexicons or other scholarly sources suggest that \"presbyteros\" means \"priest\" instead of \"elder\". The Greek word is equivalent to the Hebrew zaqen, which means \"elder\", and not priest. You can see the zaqenim described in Exodus 18:21\u201322 using some of the same equivalent Hebrew terms as Paul uses in the GK of 1&amp;2 Timothy and Titus. Note that the zaqenim are \"not\" priests (i.e., from the tribe of Levi) but are rather men of distinctive maturity that qualifies them for ministerial roles among the people.\nTherefore, the NT equivalent of the zaqenim cannot be the Levitical priests. The Greek \"presbyteros\" (literally, the comparative of the Greek word for \"old\" and therefore translated as \"one who is older\") thus describes the character qualities of the \"episkopos\". The term \"elder\" would therefore appear to describe the character, while the term \"overseer\" (for that is the literal rendering of \"episkopos\") connotes the job description.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The trees can live for several hundred years. It is a very hardy species that can withstand low winter temperatures. The American elm was once exceptionally common as a street tree, its tolerance of urban conditions making it a popular choice to line American streets in the 19th and early 20th centuries. The coming of beetles bearing Dutch elm disease devastated the American elm population, starting in the 1920s. The species still holds out in some locations, but is also no longer nearly as common as during its height.\nThe wood was seldom utilized until the advent of mechanical sawing. It is the state tree of Massachusetts and North Dakota.\nDescription.\nThe American elm is a deciduous tree which, under ideal conditions, can grow to heights of . The trunk may have a diameter at breast height (dbh) of more than , supporting a high, spreading umbrella-like canopy. The leaves are alternate, long, with double-serrate margins and an oblique base. The leaves turn yellow in the fall. The perfect flowers are small, purple-brown and, being wind-pollinated, apetalous. The flowers are also protogynous, the female parts maturing before the male, thus reducing, but not eliminating, self-fertilization, and emerge in early spring before the leaves. The fruit is a flat samara long by broad, with a circular papery wing surrounding the single seed. As in the closely related \"Ulmus laevis\" (European white elm), the flowers and seeds are borne on long stems. American elm is wholly insensitive to daylight length (photoperiod), and will continue to grow well into autumn until injured by frost. Ploidy is \"2n\" = 56, or more rarely, \"2n\" = 28.\nFor over 80 years, \"U. americana\" had been identified as a tetraploid, i.e. having double the usual number of chromosomes, making it unique within the genus. However, a study published in 2011 by the Agricultural Research Service of the United States Department of Agriculture revealed that about 20% of wild American elms are diploid and may even constitute another species. Moreover, several triploid trees known only in cultivation, such as 'Jefferson', are possessed of a high degree of resistance to DED, which ravaged American elms in the 20th century. This suggests that the diploid parent trees, which have markedly smaller cells than the tetraploid, may too be highly resistant to the disease. \nTaxonomy.\n\"Ulmus americana\" was first described and named by Carl Linnaeus in his \"Species Plantarum\", published in 1753. No subspecies or varieties are currently recognized.\nDistribution and habitat.\nThe American elm is native to eastern North America, occurring from Nova Scotia west to Alberta and Montana, and south to Florida and central Texas. It is an extremely hardy tree that can withstand winter temperatures as low as .\nThe species occurs naturally in an assortment of habitats, most notably rich bottomlands, floodplains, stream banks, and swampy ground, although it also often thrives on hillsides, uplands and other well-drained soils. On more elevated terrain, as in the Appalachian Mountains, it is most often found along rivers. The species' wind-dispersed seeds enable it to spread rapidly as suitable areas of habitat become available. American elm fruits in late spring (which can be as early as February and as late as June depending on the climate), the seeds usually germinating immediately, with no cold stratification needed (occasionally some might remain dormant until the following year). The species attains its greatest growth potential in the Northeastern US, while elms in the Deep South and Texas grow much smaller and have shorter lifespans, although conversely their survival rate in the latter regions is higher owing to the climate being less favorable to the spread of DED.\nIn the United States, the American elm is a principal member of four major forest cover types: black ash-American elm-red maple; silver maple-American elm; sugarberry-American elm-green ash; and sycamore-sweetgum-American elm, with the first two of these types also occurring in Canada. A sugar maple-ironwood-American elm cover type occurs on some hilltops near T\u00e9miscaming, Quebec.\nEcology.\nThe leaves of the American elm serve as food for the larvae of a number of species of Lepidoptera. These include such butterflies as the Eastern Comma (\"Polygonia comma\"), Question Mark (\"Polygonia interrogationis\"), Mourning Cloak (\"Nymphalis antiopa\"), Painted Lady (\"Vanessa cardui\") and Red-spotted Purple (\"Limenitis arthemis astyanax\"), as well as such moths as the Columbian Silkmoth (\"Hyalophora columbia\") and the Banded Tussock Moth (Pale Tiger Moth) (\"Halysidota tessellaris\").\nPests and diseases.\nThe American elm is susceptible to Dutch Elm Disease and to elm yellows. In North America, there are three species of elm bark beetles: one native, \"Hylurgopinus rufipes\" (\"native elm bark beetle\"); and two invasive, \"Scolytus multistriatus\" (\"smaller European elm bark beetle\") and \"Scolytus schevyrewi\" (\"banded elm bark beetle\"). Although intensive feeding by elm bark beetles can kill weakened trees, their main impact is as vectors of DED.\nAmerican elm is also moderately preferred for feeding and reproduction by the adult elm leaf beetle \"Xanthogaleruca luteola\" and highly preferred for feeding by the Japanese beetle \"Popillia japonica\" in the United States.\n\"U. americana\" is also the most susceptible of all the elms to verticillium wilt, whose external symptoms closely mimic those of DED. However, the condition is far less serious, and afflicted trees should recover the following year.\nDutch elm disease.\nDutch elm disease (DED) is a fungal disease that has ravaged the American elm, causing catastrophic die-offs in cities across the range. It has been estimated that only approximately 1 in 100,000 American elm trees is DED-tolerant, most known survivors simply having escaped exposure to the disease. However, in some areas still not infested by DED, the American elm continues to thrive, notably in Florida, Alberta and British Columbia. There is a notable grove of old American elm trees in Manhattan's Central Park. The trees there were apparently spared because of the grove's isolation in such an intensely urban setting.\nThe American elm is particularly susceptible to disease because the period of infection often coincides with the period, approximately 30 days, of rapid terminal growth when new springwood vessels are fully functional. Spores introduced outside of this period remain largely static within the xylem and are thus relatively ineffective.\nThe American elm's biology in some ways has helped to spare it from obliteration by DED, in contrast to what happened to the American chestnut with the chestnut blight. The elm's seeds are largely wind-dispersed, and the tree grows quickly and begins bearing seeds at a young age. It grows well along roads or railroad tracks, and in abandoned lots and other disturbed areas, where it is highly tolerant of most stress factors. Elms have been able to survive and to reproduce in areas where the disease had eliminated old trees, although most of these young elms eventually succumb to the disease at a relatively young age. There is some reason to hope that these elms will preserve the genetic diversity of the original population, and that they eventually will hybridize with DED-resistant varieties that have been developed or that occur naturally. After 20 years of research, American scientists first developed DED-resistant strains of elms in the late 1990s.\nElms in forest and other natural areas have been less affected by DED than trees in urban environments due to lower environmental stress from pollution and soil compaction and due to occurring in smaller, more isolated populations.\nFungicidal injections can be administered to valuable American elms, to prevent infection. Such injections generally are effective as a preventive measure for up to three years when performed before any symptoms have appeared, but may be ineffective once the disease is evident.\nCultivation.\nIn the 19th and early 20th century, American elm was a common street and park tree owing to its tolerance of urban conditions, rapid growth, and graceful form. This however led to extreme overplanting of the species, especially to form living archways over streets, which ultimately produced an unhealthy monoculture of elms that had no resistance to disease and pests. Elms do not naturally form pure stands and trees used in landscaping were grown from a handful of cultivars, causing extremely low genetic diversity. These trees' rapid growth and longevity, leading to great size within decades, made them popular before the advent of DED. Ohio botanist William B. Werthner, discussing the contrast between open-grown and forest-grown American elms, noted that:\n\"In the open, with an abundance of air and light, the main trunk divides into several leading branches which leave the trunk at a sharp angle and continue to grow upward, gradually diverging, dividing and subdividing into long, flexible branchlets whose ends, at last, float lightly in the air, giving the tree a round, somewhat flattened top of beautifully regular proportions and characteristically fine twiggery.\"\nIt is this distinctive growth form that is so valued in the open-grown American elms of street plantings, lawns, and parks; along most narrower streets, elms planted on opposite sides arch and blend together into a leafy canopy over the pavement. However, elms can assume many different sizes and forms depending on the location and climate zone. In 1926 the Klehm Nurseries of Arlington Heights, Illinois, wrote: \"American Elms grown in the regular way from seedlings show extreme variability, growing up into trees of all shapes, some of them being very slow in growth while others are moderately rapid in development. The shapes run all the way from the true open excurrent growth to globular, or flat-topped, or pendant. As regards foliage, the leaves are from small to medium large, some shedding early and others late. This condition makes it difficult for the landscape architect to choose just the right trees to obtain the effect desired.\" The classic vase-shaped elm was mainly the result of selective breeding of a few cultivars and is much less likely to occur in the wild.\nAmerican elms have been planted in North America beyond its natural range as far north as central Alberta. It also survives low desert heat at Phoenix, Arizona.\nIntroductions across the Atlantic rarely prospered, even before the outbreak of DED. Introduced to the UK by James Gordonhttp:// in 1752, the American elm was noted to be far more susceptible to insect foliage damage than native elms. The tree was propagated and marketed in the UK by the Hillier &amp; Sons nursery, Winchester, Hampshire from 1945, with 450 sold in the period 1962 to 1977 when production ceased with the advent of the more virulent form of Dutch elm disease. Some well-grown specimens, one planted in the 1880s, survive (2023) in Finland. \nIntroduced to Australasia, the tree was listed by Australian nurseries in the early 20th century. It is known to have been planted along the Avenue of Honour at Ballarat, Victoria and the Avenue of Honour in Bacchus Marsh, Victoria. In addition, a heritage-listed planting of American elms can be found along Grant Crescent in Griffith, Australian Capital Territory. American elms are only rarely found in New Zealand.\nCultivars.\nNumerous cultivars have been raised, originally for their aesthetic merit but more recently for their resistance to Dutch elm disease. The total number of named cultivars is circa 45, at least 18 of which have probably been lost to cultivation as a consequence of DED or other factors:\n and others.\nThe disease-resistant selections made available to commerce to date include 'Valley Forge', 'New Harmony', 'Princeton', 'Jefferson', 'Lewis &amp; Clark', 'Miller Park', 'St. Croix', 'Endurance', and a set of six different clones collectively known as 'American Liberty'. The United States National Arboretum released 'Valley Forge' and 'New Harmony' in late 1995, after screening tests performed in 1992\u20131993 showed both had unusually high levels of resistance to DED. 'Valley Forge' performed especially well in these tests.\n'Princeton' has been in occasional cultivation since the 1920s. 'Princeton' gained renewed attention after its performance in the 1992\u20131993 screening tests showed that it also had a high degree of disease resistance. A later test performed in 2002\u20132003 confirmed the disease resistance of 'Princeton', 'Valley Forge' and 'New Harmony', as well as that of 'Jefferson'. Thus far, plantings of these four varieties generally appear to be successful.\nIn 2005, approximately 90 'Princeton' elms were planted along Pennsylvania Avenue in front of the White House in Washington, D.C. The trees, maintained by the National Park Service, remain healthy and are thriving. However, it has been noted that \"U. americana\" cultivars are not recommended for more than singular plantings as they have unresolved DED and elm yellows concerns.\nIt has also been noted that monoculture plantings of \"U. americana\" cultivars, such as those along Pennsylvania Avenue, have disproportionate vulnerabilities to disease. Further, long-term studies of 'Princeton' in Europe and the United States have suggested that the cultivar's resistance to DED may be limited (see Pests and diseases of 'Princeton').\nThe National Elm Trial evaluated 19 elm cultivars commercially available in the United States in scientific plantings throughout the nation to assess and compare the strengths and weaknesses of each. The trial, which started in 2005, lasted for ten years. Based on the trial's final ratings, the preferred cultivars of \"U. americana\" are 'New Harmony' and 'Princeton'.\n'Jefferson' was released to wholesale nurseries in 2004 and is becoming increasingly available for planting. However, 'Jefferson' has not been widely tested beyond Washington, D.C. The National Elm Trial provided no data on 'Jefferson' because an error in tree identification had occurred earlier in the nursery trade. The error may still be causing nurseries to sell 'Princeton' elms that are mislabeled as 'Jefferson', although one can distinguish between the two cultivars as the trees mature.\nIn 2007, the 'Elm Recovery Project' from the University of Guelph in Ontario, Canada, reported that cuttings from healthy surviving old elms surveyed across Ontario had been grown to produce a bank of resistant trees, isolated for selective breeding of highly resistant cultivars.\nIn 1993, Mariam B. Sticklen and James L. Sherald reported the results of NPS-funded experiments conducted at Michigan State University in East Lansing that were designed to apply genetic engineering techniques to the development of DED-resistant strains of American elm trees. In 2007, AE Newhouse and F Schrodt of the State University of New York College of Environmental Science and Forestry in Syracuse reported that young transgenic American elm trees had shown reduced DED symptoms and normal mycorrhizal colonization.\nHybrids and hybrid cultivars.\nThousands of attempts to cross the American elm with the Siberian elm \"U. pumila\" failed. Attempts at the Arnold Arboretum using ten other American, European and Asiatic species also ended in failure, attributed to the differences in ploidy and operational dichogamy, although the ploidy factor has been discounted by other authorities.\nSuccess was eventually achieved with the autumn-flowering Chinese elm \"Ulmus parvifolia\" by the late Prof. Eugene Smalley towards the end of his career at the University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison after he overcame the problem of keeping Chinese elm pollen alive until spring. Only one of the hybrid clones was commercially released, as 'Rebella' in 2011 by the German nursery Eisele GmbH; the clone is not available in the United States.\nOther artificial hybridizations with American elm are rare, and now regarded with suspicion. Two such alleged successes by the nursery trade were 'Hamburg', and 'Kansas Hybrid', both with Siberian elm \"Ulmus pumila\". However, given the repeated failure with the two species by research institutions, it is now believed that the \"American elm\" in question was more likely to have been the red elm, \"Ulmus rubra\".\nUses.\nWood.\nThe American elm's wood is coarse, hard, and tough, with interlacing, contorted fibers that make it difficult to split or chop, and cause it to warp after sawing. Accordingly, the wood originally had few uses, save for making hubs for wagon wheels. Later, with the advent of mechanical sawing, American elm wood was used for barrel staves, trunk-slats, and hoop-poles, and subsequently became fundamental to the manufacture of wooden automobile bodies, with the intricate fibers holding screws unusually well.\nPioneer and traditional uses.\nYoung twigs and branchlets of the American elm have tough, fibrous bark that has been used as a tying and binding material, even for rope swings for children, and also for making whips.\nIn culture.\nMary Eleanor Wilkins Freeman, in her 1903 book of short stories, \"Six Trees\", wrote of the American elm:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nOn 21 March 1941 the American elm was made the state tree of Massachusetts. The designation was in commemoration of the fact that George Washington reputedly took command of the Continental Army under an elm.\nNotable trees.\nA number of mostly small to medium-sized American elms now survive in woodlands, suburban areas, and occasionally cities, where the survivors have often been relatively isolated from other elms and thus spared a severe exposure to the fungus. For example, in Central Park and Tompkins Square Park in New York City, stands of several large elms originally planted by Frederick Law Olmsted survive because of their isolation from neighboring areas in New York where there had been heavy mortality. The Olmsted-designed park system in Buffalo, New York, did not fare as well.\nA row of mature American elms lines Central Park along the entire length of Fifth Avenue from 59th to 110th Streets. In Akron, Ohio, there is a very old elm tree that has not been infected. In historical areas of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, there are also a few mature American elms still standing\u00a0\u2014 notably in Independence Square and the Quadrangle at the University of Pennsylvania, and also at the nearby campuses of Haverford College, Swarthmore College, and Pennsylvania State University, believed to be the largest remaining stand in the country.\nThere are several large American Elm trees in western Massachusetts. A large specimen, which stands on Summer Street in the Berkshire County town of Lanesborough, Massachusetts, has been kept alive by antifungal treatments. Rutgers University has preserved 55 mature elms on and in the vicinity of Voorhees Mall on the College Avenue Campus in New Brunswick, New Jersey in addition to seven disease-resistant trees that have been planted in this area of the campus in recent years.\nThe largest surviving urban forest of American elms in North America is believed to be in the city of Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada, where close to 200,000 elms remain. The city of Winnipeg spends $3 million annually to aggressively combat the disease utilizing Dursban Turf and the Dutch Trig vaccine, losing 1,500\u20134,000 trees per year.\nGovernmental agencies, educational institutions or other organizations in most of the states that are within the United States maintain lists of champion or big trees that describe the locations and characteristics of those states' largest American elm trees (see List of state champion American elm trees). The current U.S. national champion American elm tree is located in Iberville Parish, Louisiana. When measured in 2010, the tree had a trunk circumference of , a height of and an average crown spread of .\nThe current Tree Register of the British Isles (TROBI) champion grows in Avondale Forest near Rathdrum, County Wicklow, Ireland. The tree had a height of and a dbh of (circumference of ) when measured in 2000. The tree replaced on the register a larger champion located in Woodvale Cemetery in Sussex, England, which in 1988 had a height of and a diameter of or circumference of .\nA prime example of the species was the Sauble Elm, which grew beside the banks of the Sauble River in Ontario, Canada, to a height of 43\u00a0m (140\u00a0ft), with a dbh of before succumbing to DED; when it was felled in 1968, a tree-ring count established that it had germinated in 1701. Other large or otherwise significant American elm trees have included:\nTreaty Elm.\nThe Treaty Elm, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. In what is now Penn Treaty Park, the founder of Pennsylvania, William Penn, is said to have entered into a treaty of peace in 1683 with the native Lenape Turtle Clan under a picturesque elm tree immortalized in a painting by Benjamin West. West made the tree, already a local landmark, famous by incorporating it into his painting after hearing legends (of unknown veracity) about the tree being the location of the treaty. No documentary evidence exists of any treaty Penn signed beneath a particular tree. On March 6, 1810 a great storm blew the tree down. Measurements taken at the time showed it to have a circumference of , and its age was estimated to be 280 years. Wood from the tree was made into furniture, canes, walking sticks and various trinkets that Philadelphians kept as relics.\nWashington Elm (Massachusetts).\nThe Washington Elm, Cambridge, Massachusetts. George Washington is said to have taken command of the American Continental Army under the Washington Elm in Cambridge on July 3, 1775. The tree survived until the 1920s and \"was thought to be a survivor of the primeval forest\". In 1872, a large branch fell from it and was used to construct a pulpit for a nearby church. The tree, an American white elm, became a celebrated attraction, with its own plaque, a fence constructed around it and a road moved in order to help preserve it. The tree was cut down (or fell\u2014sources differ) in October 1920 after an expert determined it was dead.\nThe city of Cambridge had plans for it to be \"carefully cut up and a piece sent to each state of the country and to the District of Columbia and Alaska,\" according to \"The Harvard Crimson\". As late as the early 1930s, garden shops advertised that they had cuttings of the tree for sale, although the accuracy of the claims has been doubted. A Harvard \"professor of plant anatomy\" examined the tree rings days after the tree was felled and pronounced it between 204 and 210 years old, making it at most 62 years old when Washington took command of the troops at Cambridge. The tree would have been a little more than two feet in diameter (at 30\u00a0inches above ground) in 1773.\nIn 1896, an alumnus of the University of Washington, obtained a rooted cutting of the Cambridge tree and sent it to Professor Edmund Meany at the university. The cutting was planted, cuttings were then taken from it, including one planted on February 18, 1932, the 200th anniversary of the birth of George Washington, for whom Washington state is named. That tree remains on the campus of the Washington State Capitol. Just to the west of the tree is a small elm from a cutting made in 1979.\nWashington Elm (District of Columbia).\nGeorge Washington's Elm, Washington, D.C. George Washington supposedly had a favorite spot under an elm tree near the United States Capitol Building from which he would watch construction of the building. The elm stood near the Senate wing of the Capitol building until 1948.\nLogan Elm.\nThe Logan Elm that stood near Circleville, Ohio, was one of the largest American elms in the world. The tree had a trunk circumference of and a crown spread of . Weakened by DED, the tree died in 1964 from storm damage. The Logan Elm State Memorial commemorates the site and preserves various associated markers and monuments. According to tradition, Chief Logan of the Mingo tribe delivered a passionate speech at a peace-treaty meeting under this elm in 1774.\n\"Herbie\".\nAnother notable American elm, named Herbie, was the tallest American elm in New England until it was cut down on January 19, 2010, after it succumbed to DED. Herbie was tall at its peak and had a circumference of , or a diameter of approximately . The tree stood in Yarmouth, Maine, where it was cared for by the town's tree warden, Frank Knight.\nWhen cut down, Herbie was 217 years old. Herbie's wood is of interest to dendroclimatologists, who will use cross-sections of the trunk to help answer questions about climate during the tree's lifetime.\nThe Glencorradale Elm.\nThe Glencorradale Elm on Prince Edward Island, Canada, is a surviving wild elm believed to be several hundred years old.\nSurvivor Tree.\nAn American elm located in a parking lot directly across the street from the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City survived the Oklahoma City bombing on April 19, 1995, that killed 168 people and destroyed the Murrah building. Damaged in the blast, with fragments lodged in its trunk and branches, it was nearly cut down in efforts to recover evidence. However, nearly a year later the tree began to bloom. Then known as the Survivor Tree, it became an important part of the Oklahoma City National Memorial, and is featured prominently on the official logo of the memorial.\nParliament Hill Elm.\nThe Parliament Hill Elm was planted in Ottawa, Canada, in the late 1910s or early 1920s when Centre Block was rebuilt following the Great fire of 1916. The tree grew for approximately a century next to a statue of John A. Macdonald and was one of the few in the region to survive the spread of DED in the 1970s and 1980s. Despite protests from Ottawa area environmentalists and resistance from Opposition Members of Parliament the tree was removed in April 2019 to make way for new Centre Block renovations.\nLandscaped parks.\nCentral Park.\nNew York City's Central Park is home to approximately 1,200 American elms. The oldest of these elms were planted during the 1860s by Frederick Law Olmsted, making them among the oldest stands of American elms in the world. The trees are particularly noteworthy along the Mall and Literary Walk, where four lines of American elms stretch over the walkway forming a cathedral-like covering. A part of New York City's urban ecology, the elms improve air and water quality, reduce erosion and flooding, and decrease air temperatures during warm days.\nWhile the stand is still vulnerable to DED, in the 1980s the Central Park Conservancy undertook aggressive countermeasures such as heavy pruning and removal of extensively diseased trees. These efforts have largely been successful in saving the majority of the trees, although several are still lost each year. Younger American elms that have been planted in Central Park since the outbreak are of the DED-resistant 'Princeton' and 'Valley Forge' cultivars.\nNational Mall.\nSeveral rows of American elm trees that the National Park Service first planted during the 1930s line much of the 1.9 miles (3.0\u00a0km) length of the National Mall in Washington, D.C. DED first appeared on the trees during the 1950s and reached a peak in the 1970s. The NPS used a number of methods to control the epidemic, including sanitation, pruning, injecting trees with fungicide and replanting with DED-resistant cultivars. The NPS combated the disease's local insect vector, the smaller European elm bark beetle (\"Scolytus multistriatus\"), by trapping and by spraying with insecticides. As a result, the population of American elms planted on the Mall and its surrounding areas has remained intact for more than 80 years.\nArt and photography.\nThe nobility and arching grace of the American Elm in its heyday, on farms, in villages, in towns and on campuses, were celebrated in the books of photographs of Wallace Nutting (\"Massachusetts Beautiful\", N.Y. 1923, and other volumes in the series) and of Samuel Chamberlain (\"The New England Image\", New York, 1962). Frederick Childe Hassam is notable among painters who have depicted American Elm.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

His long reign was marked by constant civil war, the spread of the Black Death and several military defeats to the Ottoman Turks, who rose as the dominant power of the region.\nJohn V became emperor at age eight, which resulted in a civil war between his regent John VI Kantakouzenos and a rival council led by his mother Anna of Savoy, who pawned the crown jewels to Venice in order to raise funds. Kantakouzenos was recognized as emperor in 1347, coinciding with the arrival of the Black Death. Shortly after, another civil war erupted in 1352, with John V seeking help from Serbia against John VI's son Matthew and his enlisted Ottoman Turks. The Turks used the ensuing chaos to gain their first European territory on former Byzantine soil.\nJohn V assumed real power in 1354, removing John VI and his son Matthew. He attempted to gain Western support for the war against the Turks, resulting in his conversion to Catholicism in 1369 in presence of the Pope. These efforts were useless, as he was imprisoned in Venice due to his debts and was eventually forced to recognize Ottoman suzerainty. Political intriguing continued to plague his late reign; John was twice usurped from the throne, first by his son Andronikos IV in 1376 and then by his grandson John VII in 1390. He died in 1391 and was succeeded by his son Manuel, while his younger son Theodore ruled the Despotate of the Morea.\nBiography.\nJohn V was the son of Emperor Andronikos III and his wife Anna, the daughter of Count Amadeus V of Savoy by his wife Maria of Brabant. His long reign was marked by the gradual dissolution of imperial power amid numerous civil wars and the continuing ascendancy of the Ottoman Turks.\nEarly rule and first civil war.\nJohn V came to the throne at age eight. His reign began with an immediate civil war between his self-proclaimed regent, his father's friend John VI Kantakouzenos, and a self-proclaimed council of regency composed of his mother Anna, the patriarch John XIV Kalekas, and the \"megas doux\" Alexios Apokaukos. During this civil war in 1343 Anna pawned the Byzantine crown jewels for 30,000 Venetian ducats. From 1346 to 1349, the Black Death devastated Constantinople.\nSecond civil war.\nVictorious in 1347, John VI Kantakouzenos ruled as co-emperor until his son Matthew Kantakouzenos was attacked by John V in 1352, leading to a second civil war. John V asked the ruler of Serbia, Stefan Du\u0161an for help, and Du\u0161an obliged by sending 4,000 Serbian horsemen to his aid. Matthew Kantakouzenos asked his father for help, and 10,000 Ottoman Turks showed up at Demotika (Didymoteicho) in October 1352 and engaged the forces of John V's Serbian allies in an open field battle that resulted in the destruction of the allies and a victory for the more numerous Turks in the service of the Byzantines. The Ottoman Empire thus acquired its first European territory, at \u00c7impe and Gallipoli. Able to retake Constantinople in 1354, John V removed and tonsured John VI Kantakouzenos; by 1357, he had deposed Matthew as well, who had been captured by the Serbs and was ransomed to John V.\nRule and defeats.\nIn 1366, John V reached the Kingdom of Hungary, arriving at the Royal city of Buda to meet King Louis I of Hungary. However, the Byzantine emperor offended the king by staying on his horse, while Louis descended and approached him on foot. The Hungarian monarch then offered him help on the condition that John join the Catholic Church, or at least achieve recognition by the Patriarch of the Pope's supremacy. The Emperor left the court of Buda with empty hands and continued his trip through Europe searching for assistance against the Ottomans.\nThe Ottomans, who had been allied with the Kantakouzenoi, continued to press John. Suleyman Pa\u015fa, the son of the Ottoman sultan, led their forces in Europe and was able to take Adrianople and Philippopolis and to exact tribute from the emperor. John V appealed to the West for help, proposing to Pope Urban V in 1367 to end the schism between the Byzantine and Latin churches by submitting the patriarchate to the supremacy of the Pope. In October 1369, John, having travelled through Naples to Rome, formally converted to Catholicism in Saint Peter's Basilica and recognized the Pope as supreme head of the Church. He was not accompanied by the clergy of the Byzantine Church and the move failed to bring about an end to the Schism. He became the last Byzantine emperor (the first since emperor Constans II' visit in 663) to make a visit to Rome.\nImpoverished by war, he was detained as a debtor when he visited Venice in 1369 on his way back from Rome and was later captured on his way back through Bulgarian territories. In 1371, he recognized the suzerainty of the Ottoman sultan Murad I. Murad later assisted him against his son Andronikos when the latter deposed him in 1376.\nDeposition and second rule.\nIn 1390, his grandson John VII briefly usurped the throne, but was quickly overthrown. The same year, John V ordered the strengthening of the Golden Gate in Constantinople, utilizing marble from the decayed churches in and around the city. Upon completion of this construction, Bayezid I demanded that John raze these new works, threatening war and the blinding of his son Manuel, whom he held in captivity. John V carried out the Sultan's order but is said to have suffered from this humiliation and died soon thereafter on 16 February 1391, and was buried in the Hodegon Monastery in Constantinople.\nJohn V was finally succeeded to the imperial throne by his son Manuel. His younger son Theodore had already acceded to the Despotate of Morea in 1383.\nFamily.\nJohn V married Helena Kantakouzene, daughter of his co-emperor John VI Kantakouzenos and Irene Asanina, on 28 May 1347. They had at least eleven children \u2013 five sons and at least six daughters. Their known children include:\nJohn V also had an illegitimate daughter, Zampia Palaiologina, who married the official Hilario Doria.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

They are used as a spice to add pungency in many cuisines. Capsaicin and the related capsaicinoids give chili peppers their intensity when ingested or applied topically. Chili peppers exhibit a range of heat and flavors. This diversity is the reason behind the availability of different types of chili powder, each offering its own taste and heat level.\nChili peppers originated in Central or South America and were first cultivated in Mexico. European explorers brought chili peppers back to the Old World in the late 16th century as part of the Columbian Exchange, which led to the cultivation of multiple varieties across the world for food and traditional medicine. Five \"Capsicum\" species have been widely cultivated: \"annuum\", \"baccatum\", \"chinense\", \"frutescens\", and \"pubescens\".\nHistory.\nOrigins.\n\"Capsicum\" plants originated in modern-day Peru and Bolivia, and have been a part of human diets since about 7,500 BC. They are one of the oldest cultivated crops in the Americas. Chili peppers were cultivated in east-central Mexico some 6,000 years ago, and independently across different locations in the Americas including highland Peru and Bolivia, central Mexico, and the Amazon. They were among the first self-pollinating crops cultivated in those areas.\nPeru has the highest diversity of cultivated \"Capsicum\"; it is a center of diversification where varieties of all five domesticates were introduced, grown, and consumed in pre-Columbian times. The largest diversity of wild \"Capsicum\" peppers is consumed in Bolivia. Bolivian consumers distinguish two basic forms: \"ulupicas\", species with small round fruits including \"C. eximium\", \"C. cardenasii\", \"C. eshbaughii\", and \"C. caballeroi\" landraces; and \"arivivis\" with small elongated fruits including \"C. baccatum\" var. \"baccatum\" and \"C. chacoense\" varieties.\nDistribution to Europe.\nWhen Christopher Columbus and his crew reached the Caribbean, they were the first Europeans to encounter \"Capsicum\" fruits. They called them \"peppers\" because, like black pepper (\"Piper nigrum\"), which had long been known in Europe, they have a hot spicy taste unlike other foods. Chilies were first brought back to Europe by the Spanish, who financed Columbus's voyages, at the start of the large-scale interchange of plants and culture between the New World and the Old World called the Columbian exchange. Chilies appear in Spanish records by 1493. Unlike \"Piper\" vines, which grow naturally only in the tropics, chilies could be grown in temperate climates. By the mid-1500s, they had become a common garden plant in Spain and were incorporated into numerous dishes. By 1526, they had appeared in Italy, in 1543 in Germany, and by 1569 in the Balkans, where they came to be processed into paprika.\nDistribution to the rest of the world.\nThe rapid introduction of chilies to Africa and Asia was likely through Portuguese and Spanish traders in the 16th century, though the details are unrecorded. The Portuguese introduced them first to Africa and Arabia, and then to their colonies and trading posts in Asia, including Goa, Sri Lanka, and Malacca. From there, chilies spread to neighboring regions in South Asia and western Southeast Asia via local trade and natural dispersal. Around the same time, the Spanish also introduced chilies to the Philippines, where they spread to Melanesia, Micronesia, and other Pacific Islands via their monopoly of the Manila galleons. Their spread to East Asia in the late 16th century is less clear, but was likely also through local trade or through Portuguese and Spanish trading ports in Canton, China, and Nagasaki, Japan. The earliest known mention of the chili pepper in Chinese writing dates to 1591, though the pepper is thought to have entered the country in the 1570s.\nProducing chili peppers.\nCultivation.\nChili peppers are the shiny, brightly coloured fruits of species of \"Capsicum\". Botanically they are berries. The plants are small, depending on variety, making them suitable for growing in pots, greenhouses, or commercially in polytunnels. The plants are perennial, provided they are protected from cold. The fruits can be green, orange, red, or purple, and vary in shape from round and knobbly to smooth and elongated. If the fruits are picked green and unripe, more flowers develop, yielding more fruit; fruits left on the plant can become hotter in taste, and acquire their ripe coloration, at the price of a reduced harvest.\nIdeal growing conditions for peppers include a sunny position with warm, loamy soil, ideally , that is moist but not waterlogged. The seeds germinate only when warm, close to . The plants prefer warm conditions, but can tolerate temperatures down to ; and are sensitive to cold. The flowers can self-pollinate. However, at extremely high temperatures, , pollen loses viability, and its flowers are much less likely to result in fruit. For flowering, \"Capsicum\" is a non-photoperiod-sensitive crop.\nChilies are vulnerable to pests including aphids, glasshouse red spider mite, and glasshouse whitefly, all of which feed on plant sap. Common diseases include grey mould caused by \"Botrytis cinerea\"; this rots the tissues and produces a brownish-grey mould on the surface.\nPreparation.\nHarvested chilies may be used fresh, or dried, typically on the ground in hot countries, to make a variety of products. Drying enables chilies grown in temperate regions to be used in winter. For home use, chilies can be dried by threading them with cotton and hanging them up in a warm dry place to dry.\nProducts include whole dried chilies, chili flakes, and chili powder, Fresh or dried chilies are used to make hot sauce, a liquid condiment\u2014usually bottled for commercial use\u2014that adds spice to other dishes. Dried chilies are used to make chili oil, cooking oil infused with chili.\nAnnual production.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Table alignment/tables.css\" /&gt;\nIn 2020, 36 million tonnes of green chilies and peppers (counted as any \"Capsicum\" or \"Pimenta\" fruits) were produced worldwide, with China producing 46% of the total.\nSpecies and cultivars.\nSpecies of \"Capsicum\" that produce chili peppers are shown on the simplified phylogenetic tree, with examples of cultivars: The World Vegetable Center has one of the largest collection of chili peppers in the world. It has researched climate change resistant cultivars.\nIntensity.\nCapsaicin.\nThe substances that give chili peppers their pungency (spicy heat) when ingested or applied topically are capsaicin (8-methyl-\"N\"-vanillyl-6-nonenamide) and several related chemicals, collectively called \"capsaicinoids\". Pure capsaicin is a hydrophobic, colorless, odorless, and crystalline-to-waxy solid at room temperature. The quantity of capsaicin varies by variety, and depends on growing conditions. Water-stressed peppers usually produce stronger fruits. When a habanero plant is stressed, for example by shortage of water, the concentration of capsaicin increases in some parts of the fruit.\nWhen peppers are consumed by mammals such as humans, capsaicin binds with pain receptors in the mouth and throat, potentially evoking pain via spinal relays to the brainstem and thalamus where heat and discomfort are perceived. However, birds are unable to perceive the hotness and so they can eat some of the hottest peppers. The intensity of the \"heat\" of chili peppers is commonly reported in Scoville heat units (SHU), invented by American pharmacist Wilbur Scoville in 1912. Historically, it was a measure of the dilution of an amount of chili extract added to sugar syrup before its heat becomes undetectable to a panel of tasters; the more it has to be diluted to be undetectable, the more powerful the variety, and therefore the higher the rating. Since the 1980s, spice heat has been assessed quantitatively by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), which measures the concentration of heat-producing capsaicinoids, typically with capsaicin content as the main measure.\nCapsaicin is produced by the plant as a defense against mammalian predators. A study suggests that by protecting against attack by a hemipteran bug, the risk of disease caused by a \"Fusarium\" fungus carried by the insects is reduced. As evidence, the study notes that peppers increased the quantity of capsaicin in proportion to the damage caused by fungi on the plant's seeds.\nIntensity range of commonly used cultivars.\nA wide range of intensity is found in commonly used peppers:\nHottest by country.\nThe top 9 world's hottest chili peppers (by country) are:\nAs food.\nNutritional value.\nRed hot chili peppers are 88% water, 9% carbohydrates, 2% protein, and 0.4% fat (table). In a 100 gram reference amount, chili peppers supply 40 calories, and are a rich source of vitamin C and vitamin B6.\nPungency.\nDue to their unique pungency (spicy heat), chili peppers constitute a crucial part of many cuisines around the world, particularly in Chinese (especially in Sichuanese food), Mexican, Thai, Indian, Yoruba, New Mexican cuisine and many other South American, Caribbean and East Asian cuisines. In 21st-century Asian cuisine, chili peppers are commonly used across many regions. Chili is a key ingredient in many curries, providing the desired amount of heat; mild curries may be flavoured with many other spices, and may omit chili altogether.\nCooking.\nChilies with a low capsaicin content can be cooked like bell peppers, for example stuffing and roasting them. Hotter varieties need to be handled with care to avoid contact with skin or eyes; washing does not efficiently remove capsaicin from skin. Chilies can be roasted over very hot coals or grilled for a short time, as they break up if overcooked.\nThe leaves of every species of Capsicum are edible, being mildly bitter and nowhere near as hot as the fruits. They are cooked as greens in Filipino cuisine, where they are called \"dahon ng sili\" (literally \"chili leaves\"). They are used in the chicken soup \"tinola\". In Korean cuisine, the leaves may be used in kimchi.\nRegional cuisines.\nChilies are present in many cuisines. In Peru, \"Papa a la huancaina\" is a dish of potatoes in a sauce of fresh cheese and aji amarillo chilies. In Thailand, \"kaeng tai pla\" fish curry is flavoured with a \"tai pla\" sauce made with garlic, shallots, galangal, kaffir lime, turmeric, fish paste, and bird's eye chilies. In Jamaica, jerk chicken is spiced with powerful habanero chilies and allspice. Goan vindaloo curry uses the extremely hot ghost pepper or bhut jolokia to create \"perhaps [India's] hottest dish\". In Bhutan, \"ema datshi\", entirely made of chili mixed with local cheese, is the national dish. Many Mexican dishes use chilies of different types, including the jalape\u00f1o, poblano, habanero, serrano, chipotle, ancho, pasilla, guajillo, de \u00e1rbol, cascabel and mulato. These offer a wide range of flavours including citrus, earthy, fruity, and grassy. They are used in many dishes and the spicy \"mole\" sauce and Mexican salsa sauces. In Yoruba cuisine, chillies are well used in many dishes including Ewa Agoyin and Obe ata. \nOther uses.\nOrnamental plants.\nThe contrast in color and appearance makes chili plants interesting to some as a purely decorative garden plant. \nConstrained risk-taking.\nPsychologist Paul Rozin suggests that eating ordinary chilies is an example of a \"constrained risk\" like riding a roller coaster, in which extreme sensations like pain and fear can be enjoyed because individuals know that these sensations are not actually harmful. This method lets people experience extreme feelings without any significant risk of bodily harm.\nTopical use and health research.\nCapsaicin, the pungent chemical in chili peppers, is used as an analgesic in topical ointments, nasal sprays, and dermal patches to relieve pain. A 2022 review of preliminary research indicated that regular consumption of chili peppers was associated with weak evidence for a lower risk of death from cardiovascular diseases and cancer.\nChemical irritants.\nCapsaicin extracted from chilies is used in pepper sprays and some tear gas formulations as a chemical irritant, for use as less-lethal weapons for control of unruly individuals or crowds. Such products have considerable potential for misuse, and may cause injury or death.\nConflicts between farmers and elephants have long been widespread in African and Asian countries, where elephants nightly destroy crops, raid grain houses, and sometimes kill people. Farmers have found the use of chilies effective in crop defense against elephants. Elephants do not like capsaicin due to their large and sensitive olfactory and nasal system. The smell of chili causes them discomfort and deters them from feeding on the crops. By planting a few rows of the fruit around valuable crops, farmers create a buffer zone through which the elephants are reluctant to pass. Chili dung bombs are also used for this purpose. They are bricks made of mixing dung and chili, and are burned, creating a noxious smoke that keeps hungry elephants out of farmers' fields. This can lessen dangerous physical confrontation between people and elephants.\nBirds do not have the same sensitivity to capsaicin as mammals, as they lack a specific pain receptor. Chili peppers are eaten by birds living in the chili peppers' natural range, possibly contributing to seed dispersal and evolution of the protective capsaicin in chili peppers, as a bird in flight can spread the seeds further away from the parent plant after they pass through its digestive system than any land or tree dwelling mammal could do so under the same circumstances, thus reducing competition for resources.\nEtymology and spelling.\nThe English word is from nci with the same meaning. The name of the plant is unrelated to that of the country Chile. While \"pepper\" originally meant the genus \"Piper\", not \"Capsicum\", the \"Oxford English Dictionary\" and Merriam-Webster record both usages.\nThe three primary spellings are \"chili\", \"chile\" and \"chilli\", all recognized by dictionaries.\nSafety.\nThe volatile oil in chili peppers may cause skin irritation, requiring hand washing and care when touching the eyes or any sensitive body parts. Consuming hot peppers may cause stomach pain, hyperventilation, sweating, vomiting, and symptoms possibly requiring hospitalization.\nUnscrupulous traders have illegally added at least eight different synthetic dyes, including Auramine O, Chrysoidine, Sudan stains I to IV, Para red, and Rhodamine B to chili products. All these chemicals are harmful. They can be detected by liquid chromatography used together with mass spectrometry.\nIn popular culture.\nThe 16th century Spanish missionary and naturalist Jos\u00e9 de Acosta noted the supposed aphrodisiac power of chilies, but wrote that they were harmful to people's spiritual health. In the 1970s, the government of Peru forbade prison inmates to consume chilies, their explanation being that these were \"not appropriate for men forced to live a limited lifestyle.\"\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He served as grand domestic under Andronikos III Palaiologos and regent for John V Palaiologos before reigning as Byzantine emperor in his own right from 1347 to 1354. Deposed by his former ward, he was forced to retire to a monastery under the name Joasaph Christodoulos () and spent the remainder of his life as a monk and historian. At age 90 or 91 at his death, he was the longest-lived of the Roman emperors. His two disastrous civil wars led to the loss of much of the remaining territory in the Balkans under Byzantine control to the Serbian and Bulgarian empires, but the most severe loss during his civil war was the loss of the Gallipoli peninsula to the Ottoman Turks, allowing the Ottomans to gain territory in Europe and setting the stage for the destruction of the Byzantine Empire a century later.\nEarly life.\nBorn in Constantinople, John Kantakouzenos was the son of Michael Kantakouzenos, governor of the Morea; Donald Nicol speculates that he may have been born after his father's death and raised as an only child. Through his mother Theodora Palaiologina Angelina, he was related to the then-reigning house of Palaiologos. He was also related to the imperial dynasty through his wife Irene Asanina, a second cousin of Emperor Andronikos III Palaiologos. Kantakouzenos became a close friend to Andronikos III and was one of his principal supporters in Andronikos's struggle against his grandfather, Andronikos II Palaiologos. On the accession of Andronikos III in 1328, he was entrusted with the supreme administration of affairs and served as grand domestic throughout his reign. He was named regent to Andronikos's successor, the 9-year-old John V, upon the emperor's death in June 1341.\nKantakouzenos apparently began with no imperial ambitions of his own, having refused several times to be crowned co-emperor by Andronikos III. After the death of the emperor, Kantakouzenos again refused to take the throne, insisting on the legitimacy of John V's claim and contenting himself with overseeing the empire's administration until the boy came of age: according to the history written by John VI himself. Whether he would have remained loyal is unknowable but, despite his professed devotion to John V and his mother Anna, she came to suspect him of treason. His close friendship with the late emperor and power over his successor had aroused the jealousy of his former prot\u00e9g\u00e9s, Patriarch John XIV of Constantinople and Alexios Apokaukos; after a series of failed attempts, they succeeded in overthrowing his regency in September 1341 while he was out of the capital readying an army against the Crusader principalities that still held parts of the Peloponnesus. He attempted to negotiate with the usurpers, but this was rebuffed and his army was ordered to disband. Further, his relatives in Constantinople were driven into exile or imprisoned, with their property confiscated by the new regents. His mother Theodora died owing to the mistreatment she suffered while under house arrest. His army ignored the new regents' orders and proclaimed Kantakouzenos emperor at Didymoteichon in Thrace as John VI. He accepted this, while continuing to style himself as the junior ruler to John V.\nCivil war.\nThe ensuing civil war lasted six years; calling in foreign allies and mercenaries of every description, the two sides completely disrupted and almost ruined the empire. At first, John VI marched to Thessalonica, which the ruling families planned to hand over to him. Apokaukos anticipated this move and sent a fleet to reinforce the city, obliging John to flee to Serbia, where Stefan Du\u0161an sheltered him and lent him military support. This proved largely ineffectual, and only the intervention of John's old friend and ally Umur of Aydin broke the regency's siege of his headquarters at Didymoteichon.\nDuring another attempt on Thessalonica the following year, the Serbians switched sides to support the regency, leaving John stranded once more before that city. Yet again, Umur came to his rescue, and their combined forces broke out of Macedonia to return to Didymoteichon. The war dragged on another four years as neither side could dislodge the other, although time was on John VI's side. He struck a bargain with the Ottoman Turks, giving Orhan Bey his daughter, Theodora, for his harem and permitting him to take Greek Christians as slaves. The Greco-Turkish force prevailed and John VI entered Constantinople in triumph on 8 February 1347. Empress Anna and John VI agreed that the latter would rule as senior emperor for ten years, after which John V would reach seniority and share power as an equal to Kantakouzenos. The formal coronation of John VI took place on 21 May.\nReign.\nDuring John's reign, the empire\u2014already fragmented, impoverished, and weakened\u2014continued to be assailed on every side.\nThe Genoese, disregarding the terms of the treaty which permitted their colony at Galata, began fortifying and arming it. Their customs dues undercut the Byzantines and meant that as much as 87% of the revenue from control of the Bosphorus went to them instead of the empire. John VI attempted to rebuild the shattered Byzantine navy in preparation for the war he expected to follow a reduction of Constantinople's own customs dues. He was able to borrow enough to construct 9 fair-sized ships and about 100 smaller ones before he lowered the rates and began siphoning off Genoa's income. When they did declare war, however, they were able to sink or capture his fleet by early 1349. The Genoese were forced to negotiate after major areas of Galata were burnt, including its wharves and warehouses, but the Byzantine Empire thenceforth was forced to turn to an alliance with the Republic of Venice for naval protection. This led to their involvement in Venice's 1350 war against Genoa, but Paganino Doria was able to force John VI (and the twelve ships he had fielded) out of the war by a Pyrrhic victory off Constantinople the next year.\nIn 1351, Kantakouzenos oversaw the Fifth Council of Constantinople, wherein Gregory Palamas' mystical hesychastic theology was declared Orthodox over the objections of Barlaam of Calabria and other Byzantine philosophers.\nBy this time, Stefan Du\u0161an had taken Albania, Macedonia, and Epirus. John VI secured help against further incursions by again allying with the Turks. Following an earthquake, they annexed Callipolis (Gallipoli)\u2014their first foothold in Europe\u2014in partial payment of his many debts in 1354.\nHe made his son Matthew Asen Kantakouzenos another co-emperor in 1353, but John VI's attempts to expand taxation to repay the government's debts had long been displeasing. He was soon removed from power by John V, becoming a monk on 10 December 1354.\nRetirement.\nKantakouzenos retired to a monastery, where he assumed the name of Joasaph Christodoulos and occupied himself with literary labors, which have been called eloquent. His 4-volume \"History\" of the years 1320\u20131356 served as an apologia for his actions. They are therefore not always trustworthy, including defects in matters where he was not personally involved, but are supplemented by the contemporary work of Nicephorus Gregoras. It is nevertheless remarkable for being the only surviving account any Byzantine emperor gave of his own reign.\nIn 1367 Joasaph was appointed the representative of the Eastern Orthodox Church to negotiate with the Latin Patriarch Paul to attempt a reconciliation of the Eastern Orthodox and Catholic churches. They agreed to call a grand ecumenical council to be attended by the Pope and all the patriarchs, archbishops, and bishops of both the eastern and western churches. This plan was subsequently refused by Pope Urban V and eventually nothing came of it.\nKantakouzenos withdrew to the Peloponnese as a monk. There is no record of Kantakouzenos's burial, but it is possible that he was buried in one of the monasteries established by his son Manuel.\nFamily.\nBy his wife Irene Asanina, a daughter of Andronikos Asen (son of Ivan Asen III of Bulgaria by Irene Palaiologina, Empress of Bulgaria, herself daughter of Michael VIII Palaiologos), John VI Kantakouzenos had six children:\nWorks.\nKantakouzenos's four-volume \"History\" was published by Johannes Isacius Pontanus in 1603, by Ludwig Schopen at Bonn as part of the \"Corpus Scriptorum Historiae Byzantinae\" c.\u20091830, and by Jacques Paul Migne at Paris. He also wrote a commentary on the first five books of Aristotle's \"Ethics\" and several controversial theological treatises, including a defense of Hesychasm and a work titled \"Against Mohammedanism\" printed in Migne.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "74227", "revid": "45417033", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=74227", "title": "John VII Palaiologos", "text": "Byzantine emperor in 1390\nJohn VII Palaiologos or Palaeologus (; 1370 \u2013 22 September 1408) was Byzantine emperor for five months in 1390, from 14 April to 17 September. A handful of sources suggest that John VII sometimes used the name Andronikos (), possibly to honour the memory of his father, Andronikos IV Palaiologos, though he reigned under his birth name.\nAndronikos IV was the firstborn son of Emperor John V Palaiologos (r.\u20091341\u00a0\u2013\u00a01391), and had thus been the heir to the throne. After a failed rebellion in 1373, Andronikos IV was imprisoned and partially blinded, the same punishment possibly being carried out on John VII, then only three years old. Andronikos IV escaped in 1376 and successfully took Constantinople, ruling as emperor until 1379. John VII served as co-emperor during this time, possibly being appointed in 1377. Though deposed in 1379 by his brother Manuel II Palaiologos and their father John V, Andronikos IV never renounced his claims. To prevent further conflict, it was agreed in 1381 that Andronikos IV was to succeed John V, making John VII second-in-line to the throne.\nUpon Andronikos IV's death in 1385, John VII inherited his claims. Despite the previous agreement, Manuel was seen by John V as the favoured successor. John VII rebelled against John V and successfully seized Constantinople in 1390. After just five months, Manuel succeeded in deposing his nephew with the help of the Ottomans and the Knights Hospitaller. Upon John V's death in 1391, Manuel succeeded him as emperor. Still possessing a powerful network of allies, John VII never surrendered his claim to be the legitimate emperor, and the tense relationship between him and his uncle brought the empire close to civil war several times. Though they were only honoured to a limited extent by Manuel, several agreements in regards to status and the line of succession were made between the two in order to avoid conflict, certifying that John VII remained co-emperor and was to succeed Manuel upon his death.\nIn 1394, the Ottoman sultan Bayezid I besieged Constantinople. Manuel left the city in 1399 to travel around Western Europe in search for military aid, and entrusted John VII with serving as regent in Constantinople, overseeing its defense. Despite allegations of conspiring with the Ottomans, John VII held the city loyally for the entire duration of Manuel's three and a half years-long journey, refusing to surrender it to Bayezid. The threat to Constantinople ended with Bayezid's defeat against the Timurids at the Battle of Ankara in 1402. In the aftermath of this battle, John VII negotiated a favourable treaty with one of Bayezid's sons, S\u00fcleyman \u00c7elebi, which ensured that the important city of Thessalonica, lost to the Ottomans in 1387 due to the actions of Manuel, was returned to imperial control. Despite John VII's loyal service, Manuel sent him away in disgrace once he returned in 1403, and the two were once more enemies. This feud proved to be brief, as they were reconciled a few months later and a new agreement was made, in which John VII was allowed to take possession of Thessalonica and was acknowledged with the full imperial title. From 1403 until his death in 1408, John VII thus ruled in Thessalonica as \"Emperor of All Thessaly\", with his own separate imperial court. The Thessalonians considered him an able ruler, and his work with local church affairs and improving the city's defensive structures garnered him a positive remembrance.\nBiography.\nBackground and early life.\nJohn VII Palaiologos was born in 1370 as the only son of Andronikos IV Palaiologos and Keratsa of Bulgaria, a daughter of Emperor Ivan Alexander of Bulgaria. Andronikos IV was the first-born son of Emperor John V Palaiologos (r.\u20091341\u00a0\u2013\u00a01391) and thus the legitimate heir to the Byzantine throne.\nThe Palaiologos dynasty, in power since 1259/1261, was often plagued by infighting, with the emperors and princes of the family often being unable to cooperate among themselves, to the detriment of the empire. The main enemy of the Byzantines at this time was the Ottoman Empire, which throughout the 14th century conquered vast swaths of former imperial territory. John V had even agreed to serve the Ottoman sultan Murad I (r.\u20091362\u00a0\u2013\u00a01389) as a tributary vassal. At this time, despite geopolitical adversity, Byzantine and Ottoman aristocrats were in close contact with each other.\nWhile John was serving on an Ottoman campaign in Anatolia, as per his vassalage agreement with Murad I, Andronikos and one of Murad I's sons, Savc\u0131 Bey, co-ordinated simultaneous revolts against their fathers. The two princes were defeated, captured and imprisoned within a few months, as their fathers joined forces to put down the revolts. Andronikos and Savc\u0131 suffered harsh punishment. Savc\u0131 was blinded and beheaded by Murad I, and though the sultan ordered John V to blind his son as well, the Byzantine emperor was reluctant, only partially following through. Andronikos was only partially blinded, apparently losing just one of his eyes. Some sources suggest that Andronikos's infant son John, the later John VII, only three years old at the time, was also partially blinded in the same way. Furthermore, Andronikos lost his right of succession to the throne, with his younger brother, Manuel II Palaiologos, being designated as heir by John V instead.\nImprisoned with his family in the Prison of Anemas in Constantinople, Andronikos escaped in July 1376, together with his wife and son, to Galata, a colony of the Republic of Genoa on the other side of the Golden Horn, where he was enthusiastically received by the Genoese. The Genoese preferred Andronikos over John V, due to the latter having recently granted the island of Tenedos to their rival, the Republic of Venice, thus hurting their commercial interests. Andronikos also retained the support of a large fraction of Byzantine society, despite his rebellious actions, and successfully took Constantinople on 12 August that same year, with Genoese and Ottoman support. John V and Manuel were imprisoned, and Andronikos ruled as emperor for three years before they escaped and deposed him. During his father's reign (12 August 1376 \u2013 1 July 1379), John VII was proclaimed co-emperor, probably in 1377. Even after being deposed, Andronikos never renounced his claim to the throne, residing in Galata and openly declaring his intentions to retake the capital.\nThe standoff between Andronikos and the emperors in Constantinople lasted until 1381, when an agreement was reached that Andronikos and his son John were to be John V's successors as emperors. Furthermore, Andronikos was once more recognised as junior co-emperor and was allowed to retain and use the title of \"basileus\" (emperor). Andronikos also received lands around Selymbria as an appanage in 1382.\nAndronikos predeceased John V, dying on 25 or 28 June 1385. John VII inherited his father's lands around Selymbria and, as per the 1381 agreement, also inherited the right to use the title \"basileus\", becoming a junior co-emperor of the Byzantine Empire. He also inherited his father's claim to be John V's legitimate heir. From his position as junior emperor, John VII received support from the Ottoman Empire, especially from the time of Bayezid I's accession (1389) onwards, and from the Genoese. The Genoese support did not escape the attention of John V. At some point between 1387 and 1391, John V is recorded as having complained to the Genoese that the inhabitants of Galata were acclaiming and saluting John VII as if he were the senior emperor, while denying John V the appropriate honours.\nUsurpation of the throne and reign.\nDespite the agreement of 1381, which explicitly stated that John VII was the legitimate successor, and Manuel having shown some rebellious tendencies himself, Manuel remained John V's favoured heir and represented John VII's main obstacle on the way to the throne. When Manuel was away campaigning in Anatolia in 1390, John VII, twenty years old, seized the moment and proclaimed himself sole emperor, laying siege to Constantinople. According to the contemporary Russian chronicler Ignatius of Smolensk, 1390 had seen a strong current of opinion in John VII's favour. John VII had secured the support of the Ottoman sultan Bayezid I and the Genoese; shortly before the siege (probably in late 1389) he had even travelled to Genoa in person to rally support. As he travelled back to the Byzantine Empire by land, it is possible that John VII passed through Bulgaria, where he might also have sought the assistance of Ivan Sratsimir and Ivan Shishman, Tsars of Bulgaria in Vidin and Tarnovo, respectively.\nIn addition to his external allies, a large percentage of the population within Constantinople also supported John VII, and might even have approved of subtle Ottoman intervention in the succession. John entered the city on 14 April 1390, his brief siege having ended through a group of commoners opening the Gate of Charisius, without struggle, and letting him in. Though some coercion was used, before long everyone inside the city had recognised and acclaimed John VII as emperor, submitting to his rule.\nThere is some contemporary evidence that John VII used the name Andronikos at the time of his usurpation. Ignatius of Smolensk, eyewitness to the event, wrote that the soldiers in John VII's service shouted the acclamation \"Polla ta eti Andronikou!\", rather than the expected \"Polla ta eti Ioannou!\" and records of the registers of expenses in Galata in 1390 mention that the emperor in Constantinople at the time was \"Andronico Paleologo\". It is possible that John VII changed his name to Andronikos upon his father's death in 1385 to honour his memory, or adopted it only in 1390, in order to avoid confusion and facilitate his usurpation of the throne. If his soldiers and the people of Constantinople were to depose an emperor named John and proclaim another of the same name, the entire affair could be conducted in bewilderment. By using the name Andronikos, any such issues would be avoided. During his actual reign as emperor, after successfully taking the throne, John VII does not appear to have used the second name, reigning under his birth name. In treaties he signed he is referred to as John, and contemporary Byzantine authors also consistently refer to him by his birth name, ignoring any second name for him.\nThe few activities recorded to have been conducted during John VII's brief reign suggest that he believed that he was going to rule for a long time. In June, he signed a treaty with Venice and throughout his time as emperor he issued (imperial decisions/commands) and minted coins. John VII is also recorded to have supported the restoration of Macarius to the Patriarchate of Constantinople. Macarius had been Patriarch of Constantinople during the reign of John VII's father, in 1376\u20131379.\nJohn VII's reign ended in the same year as it had begun, when Manuel returned from his campaign. With the support of the Knights Hospitaller and the Ottomans, Manuel deposed John VII, who had ruled just five months, on 17 September and restored the rule of John V. After helping Manuel retake the city for his father, sultan Bayezid I forced him to live at the Ottoman court, acting as a submissive vassal.\nGovernor in Selymbria and pretensions.\nJohn VII never gave up his claim to be emperor, and continued to be a powerful political player in the Byzantine Empire for years following his deposition. Sometime before 1397, possibly as early as 1390, John married Irene Gattilusio, daughter of Francesco II Gattilusio, the lord of the island of Lesbos. After John V returned to the throne, Bayezid summoned both junior co-emperors, Manuel and John VII, to join the sultan's campaigns in Anatolia. They were both forced to take part in the Ottoman subjection of Philadelphia, the last Christian city in western Anatolia. When John V died in 1391, Manuel, at Bayezid's court at the time, quickly made his way to Constantinople to pre-empt John VII claiming the throne.\nJohn VII continued to govern Selymbria following John V's death and continued to aspire to become senior emperor following Manuel II's rise to the throne. He ruled Selymbria as a vassal of Bayezid I, which meant that he was forced to aid the sultan in further campaigns in Anatolia. According to historian John W. Barker, John VII attempted to sell his claim to the Byzantine throne to Charles VI of France. In 1397 in Selymbria, John VII supposedly entrusted the French nobles Henry of Bar and John of Nevers with negotiating with Charles VI, with John VII seeking a French castle and a generous pension in return for giving up the title. Barker's hypothesis is based on a real legal document signed on 15 July 1397, possibly at Saray rather than Selymbria, but the document itself contains no mentions of what rights John VII entrusted the French nobles with or what his exact intentions in negotiating with Charles VI were. The idea that John VII intended to sell his claims is based on premature interpretations of the document itself and notes by the nobles concerning a discussion with Francesco II Gattilusio on Lesbos, during which Gattilusio supposedly divulged what he believed John's intentions to be.\nJohn VII's hopes of claiming the throne continued to be supported by Bayezid I, who saw him as a more promising candidate than the staunchly anti-Ottoman Manuel II. By supporting John VII, Bayezid hoped to turn the Byzantine Empire into an obedient vassal state, as it had nearly been under John V's rule. Though Bayezid was a significant ally, his overt support for John was used by Manuel II in his efforts to delegitimise John's claims. In some of Manuel II's early texts, he went as far as to claim that John's ultimate plan was to surrender Constantinople to the Ottomans.\nDespite Manuel's propaganda campaign, John still enjoyed considerable support, both within the empire and among its allies. In addition to Bayezid, John continued to be supported by the Republic of Genoa, with which he had commercial connections. In addition, John was also backed by a wide network of rich Byzantine aristocrats. His wide support and wealth gave him a constant pool of resources that he could use in the feud with his uncle.\nIn addition to his backing by certain aristocrats and his international allies, there was also a faction within Constantinople, mainly composed of commoners, who wished to restore John VII as senior emperor, as late as 1399. This faction opposed Manuel II's rule, believing that he did not care about the empire's survival, and that he ruled as a tyrant. As John VII had been constitutionally invested with the right to succeed to the throne in 1381, they saw him as the legitimate heir, not Manuel, who was viewed as a usurper more interested in his own power than anything else. This perception of Manuel was used by John VII in his own propaganda.\nReconciliation with Manuel II and tenure as regent.\nTensions between John VII and Manuel escalated as Bayezid began to threaten to conquer Constantinople. In 1394, Bayezid laid siege to the city. Encouraged by the French knight Boucicaut, who had been placed as the leader of Constantinople's defense and who had good relations with both John VII and Manuel, the two emperors reached an agreement meant to end their dynastic feud in 1399. According to the Byzantine monk Symeon of Thessalonica, John VII's attitude towards Manuel had only changed because Bayezid had attacked his lands around Selymbria in 1397. The agreement was that Manuel adopted John VII, and that John VII in turn adopted Manuel's sons and daughters, uniting the two branches of the family. Manuel also formally acknowledged John VII as the first co-emperor, outranking Manuel's own son, John VIII Palaiologos, who then became the second co-emperor.\nThe agreement allowed Manuel to leave the city in a three-year long mission to travel around Europe in an attempt to secure military aid, while John was entrusted to remain in Constantinople as regent, governing the city in Manuel's absence. Though in effect having become Emperor-regent, John's responsibility was mainly the defense of Constantinople, not other matters normally handled by the emperor. Due to a lack of sources, John VII's regency in Constantinople is not well documented, and the extent of his power and how he exercised it is not entirely clear. It does not appear that the 1399 agreement was honoured by Manuel, as he sent his family (now ostensibly John's family) to his brother Theodore Palaiologos in the Morea. The only textual records that survive of John's activities in Constantinople are treaties with the Venetians and Genose, and documentation of his decision to depose Patriarch Matthew I. Matthew I had many enemies in Constantinople, for reasons not entirely clear, and the anti-Matthew faction managed to persuade John VII to depose him. He would later be restored by Manuel once he returned to Constantinople. In the Byzantine Empire, ultimate authority to appoint patriarchs rested with the emperor alone.\nWhile besieging the city, Bayezid attempted to appeal to John VII's supporters by posing as a defender of John VII's legitimacy and offering peace on the condition that John was restored to the throne, terms that had been refused by Manuel before he left, a decision which prolonged the siege. Once Manuel had left the city, Bayezid tried to negotiate directly with John VII. Perhaps overlooking that he had supported Manuel's deposition of John VII in 1390, his own attack on John VII's lands in Selymbria in 1397, and the reconciliation between the two emperors, Bayezid seemed to still believe that he could rely on John VII to do his bidding. Shortly after Manuel's departure from Constantinople, he sent the following message to John VII from Adrianople:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;If I have indeed put the Basileus Manuel out of the city, not for your sake have I done this, but for mine. And if, then, you wish to be our friend, withdraw from thence and I will give you a province, whatever one you may wish. But if you do not, with God and his great Prophet as my witness, I will spare no one, but all will I utterly destroy.\nJohn VII refused to surrender the city and replied defiantly to Bayezid's messenger, recorded as having said the following:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Withdraw, report to your lord: we are in poverty and there is no great power whereunto we may flee, except to God who aids the powerless and Who overpowers the powerful. So if you wish anything, do it!\nThe situation grew more grim as time went on and Manuel's absence dragged on. Though Venice had promised to send military aid to lift the siege, the promised forces never arrived. Despite his forces being exhausted and the Timurids appearing in the eastern parts of his empire, Bayezid refused to abandon the siege. Throughout the six-year-long siege, the citizens of Constantinople suffered. Many of them chose to escape from the walls to personally surrender to the Ottoman forces.\nDespite having refused to surrender the city, John VII maintained some connections to Bayezid. Early in January 1401, John VII was away from Constantinople, attempting to sign an agreement with Bayezid. Whatever he did, it appears to have worked momentarily as the siege was lifted for a brief period in the summer. In 1402, John VII is recorded as present on an Ottoman military expedition in the Peloponnese. On 1 June 1402, as the siege was escalating, John VII sent a letter to Henry IV of England, writing of the urgent danger threatening Constantinople. About a month after this letter was sent, Bayezid finally left the city, having to deal with the Timurids. Bayezid's defeat and capture at the Battle of Ankara on 20 July 1402, and the subsequent period of Ottoman civil war it sparked, ended the siege of Constantinople and saved the city.\nThe Ottoman defeat at Ankara was used by John to negotiate a treaty with one of Bayezid I's sons, S\u00fcleyman \u00c7elebi, in which the city of Thessalonica, as well as substantial territories in Thrace and Macedonia, were returned to the Byzantine Empire. John baptised and christianised two of Bayezid's sons in 1403: \u0130sa \u00c7elebi and Yusuf \u00c7elebi. \u0130sa may have been adopted by John, and Yusuf is recorded to have continued to live in Constantinople, attested there as late as 1413.\nUpon Manuel's return to Constantinople in June 1403, John returned power to him. Though some contemporary comments seem to suggest that everyone expected John VII to refuse to surrender power, John VII appears to have been content with letting go of his responsibilities after governing the Byzantine capital for three and a half years. Once Manuel returned, he reversed several of John VII's decisions, for instance disavowing a treaty John VII had arranged with the Ottomans, in which he had granted them religious and financial privileges.\nFurther tensions within the imperial family.\nAfter Manuel's return in 1403, relations between him and John VII were tense once more. Since he knew that John VII could no longer rely on the support of the Ottomans, Manuel attempted to completely exclude him from the imperial hierarchy, stripping him of the title \"basileus\" and depriving him of his promised lands in Selymbria and Thessalonica. The reasons for excluding John was attributed by Manuel to rumours that John had initiated negotiations in 1402 with Bayezid concerning the surrender of Constantinople. The contemporary Castilian traveller Ruy Gonz\u00e1lez de Clavijo wrote that John and Bayezid had agreed that should Bayezid defeat the Timurids, John would surrender the city. It is doubtful that such an agreement was ever made, especially since John proved himself to be loyal for the duration of his tenure as regent and concluded a highly favourable treaty with the Ottoman prince S\u00fcleyman \u00c7elebi. According to German historian Peter Wirth, it is possible that the reason for resentment again brewing up between John and Manuel after Manuel's return could be that Manuel felt that he had been ignored and left out of these important negotiations.\nJohn was sent to the island of Lemnos, apparently in disgrace, but fled to his father-in-law Francesco on nearby Lesbos. Soon thereafter, in September 1403, John and Francesco launched a naval expedition against Thessalonica, though it appears to have had little to no result. The expedition was not some attempt to seize the city from Manuel's control, but rather to liberate it from the Ottomans, as an Ottoman garrison was still present. John VII and Francesco returned to Lesbos, where Boucicaut was also residing at the time. Together with Boucicaut, they then travelled to Constantinople at the head of an army, planning to take the city from Manuel by force.\nThough they ultimately chose not to attack the city, John VII's drastic actions called for a new political agreement between the dynasts. The resulting 1403 agreement between John VII and Manuel was similar to the one they had made in 1399. As Manuel's adoptive son, John VII remained the first co-emperor and Manuel's actual son, John VIII, continued being the second co-emperor. John VII's rights to Thessalonica were also affirmed. Clavijo, present in Constantinople at the time, writes that both Manuel and John VII were designated as full emperors and that John VII was to reign alone after Manuel's death, after which he was to be succeeded by Manuel's son John VIII, who in turn would be succeeded by John VII's newly born son, Andronikos V Palaiologos. Contemporary reactions to the resolution appear to have been bitter. Clavijo wrote that he did not believe that the agreement would be respected by either emperor.\nEmperor in Thessalonica.\nThe transfer of Thessalonica from Ottoman control to the Byzantines was overseen by Manuel's confidant, Demetrios Laskaris Leontares, who per the agreement between the two emperors handed it over to John VII. According to preserved documents signed by John VII, he probably first arrived in Thessalonica in late 1403. Though John was accompanied on the initial journey by some of Manuel's staunchest supporters, such as Leontares and Demetrios Chrysoloras, who were ordered to keep an eye on his activities, John VII immediately assumed autonomy from Constantinople. Despite their agreement and John VII's \"de facto\" autonomy, Manuel's texts state that John was \"given\" Thessalonica by Manuel, a phrasing which suggests that Manuel still considered himself to be John VII's superior. Though no known surviving copies exist, a detailed oath was drawn up between Manuel and John, which decided upon a well-defined border between the empires of Constantinople and Thessalonica. Some territories located nearer to Thessalonica than to Constantinople, such as Mount Athos, were kept as sworn to Constantinople.\nJohn was invested as Despot of Thessalonica and was allowed to keep the full imperial title. While ruling Thessalonica, John VII is attested as having used the title , variously translated as \"Emperor of Thessaly\", \"Emperor of All Thessaly\", \"Emperor of all the Thessaly\" or \"Emperor of all of Thessaly\". Though he had assumed this new title, John VII never stopped asserting his right to be the legitimate Byzantine emperor, continuing to use the titles \"autokrator\" and \"basileus\", identical to the titulature of Manuel. In foreign correspondence, he was addressed in the same way as his uncle. Preserved treaties with the Italian republics refer to John VII as \"imperador di Griesi\" (\"Emperor of the Greeks\") and \"lo gran imperator Caloiani imperador di Griesi\" (\"The great emperor Kalojoannes, Emperor of the Greeks\"). John's entry into Thessalonica was commemorated in a Byzantine ivory pyxis (a cylindrical box with a lid). This pyxis, today held at Dumbarton Oaks, depicts both the imperial family of John VII (including his wife Irene and his son Andronikos V) and the imperial family of Manuel II (including his wife Helena Draga\u0161 and his son, John VIII).\nAt Thessalonica, John VII created his own treasury and issued his own coins with his own portrait rather than that of Manuel. He created his own imperial court and chancery, where documents were signed with his name rather than the name of Manuel. Throughout John's reign in Thessalonica, which lasted until his death in 1408, the Byzantine Empire thus experienced a period of dual rule, essentially divided into two. John's activities as emperor in Thessalonica consisted mainly of organising the city's defense and regulating local church property. He appears to have been content with his position; there are no further records of conflict between John VII and Manuel after the events of 1403.\nJohn VII's arrival in Thessalonica meant more to the Thessalonians than simply the arrival of an emperor. Through his 1403 treaty, John VII had liberated the city from the Ottomans and once more made it into the second city of the Byzantine Empire. Though Manuel had also been involved in some of the negotiations, the majority of the credit for ensuring Thessalonica's return to imperial control has to be given to John VII. As such, his arrival in the city was not just the arrival of a new governor, but of the city's liberator. Throughout his reign in Thessalonica, the Thessalonians continued to view John VII as an able ruler. According to Symeon of Thessalonica, John VII \"fortified [the city] on all sides with triremes and outer walls\" and \"adorned [it] with good regulations and institutions\".\nShortly after arriving in Thessalonica, John VII had raised his son, Andronikos V, to co-emperor. John VII viewed Andonikos V as not just his own legitimate successor, but the future legitimate successor to the Byzantine Empire. This can be gathered from the aforementioned pyxis depicting Andronikos V more prominently than Manuel's heir, John VIII, as well as monodies composed after Andronikos V's death. One such monody states that Andronikos's parents had \"regarded him gladly as their successor\". Andronikos V, who was named after his grandfather Andronikos IV, was per the 1403 agreement the legitimate heir to the empire, set to be the heir to Manuel's son John VIII. Any plans for Andronikos V's future fell through when he died in 1407 at the age of seven. Some time after Andronikos V's death, John became a monk, assuming the monastic name Joseph. John VII died in Thessalonica a year after Andronikos V, on 22 September 1408, at the relatively young age of 38. With the deaths of Andronikos V and John VII, the rival imperial lineage that had been established by Andronikos IV died out.\nLegacy.\nJohn VII was positively remembered in Thessalonica. The city was often not wholly obedient to Constantinople, with its leaders often going their own way in terms of administration. To the citizens of Thessalonica, John's death was a significant blow to their autonomy. John VII's reign in Thessalonica was the last time the city served as a counter-capital of sorts to Constantinople. Manuel visited the city in 1409 and installed his young son, Andronikos, as governor. While he was met with many approving citizens, there were also many who opposed a ruler from Constantinople being imposed upon them. That the Thessalonians had enjoyed the rule of a leader with a rebellious past, who just like Manuel bore the title \"basileus\", had probably only stimulated the city's separatist tendencies.\nA praiseful passage in a eulogy of John, from the \"Synodikon\" of Thessalonica, reads:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt; For our emperor John Palaiologos fought almost on his knees fiercely and courageously in defense of the Romans at a time when foreign peoples were leaning towards us [...] and when an unspeakably most powerful billow which had been raised and was threatening to destroy everything, and released the emperor from slavery and secured our safety by all possible means. \nAnother eulogy, this one probably written by Symeon of Thessalonica, contains this passage:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;He conducted himself in a truly orthodox manner through his entire life. He was an outstanding defender of the church and its sacred doctrines ... When waves of unheard-of violence rose up and threatened to engulf everything, he did not yield, but like a good pilot he again took control for the Romans. He recovered several cities from the hands of the barbarians, of which the first and greatest was our own Thessalonike, seeing the light of freedom after long servitude. He established his residence in our city and, neglecting nothing that was needed, he employed all means to assure our safety. He also gained many victories and triumphs over his own sufferings; the great variety of illnesses which he bore caused him to progress in virtue.\nOther eulogies, as well as a similarly praiseful monody by the contemporary Byzantine author Theodore Potamios, almost give the impression that a cult of John VII was beginning to develop in Thessalonica.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Ruling from 1425 to 1448, he attempted to bring about the reunification of the Orthodox and Catholic churches and prioritized the protection of Constantinople against the Ottoman Empire. He was succeeded by his brother, Constantine XI, who would become the final emperor.\nBiography.\nJohn VIII was the eldest son of Manuel II Palaiologos and Helena Draga\u0161, the daughter of the Serbian prince Constantine Draga\u0161. He was associated as co-emperor with his father before 1416 and became sole emperor upon the death of his father on 21 July 1425, although he had already assumed full power on 19 January 1421.\nIn June 1422, John VIII Palaiologos supervised the defense of Constantinople during a siege by Murad II, but had to accept the loss of Thessalonica, which his brother Andronikos had given to Venice in 1423. To secure protection against the Ottomans, he made two journeys to Italy in 1423 and 1439. During the second journey he visited Pope Eugene IV in Ferrara and consented to the union of the Greek and Roman churches. The union was ratified at the Council of Florence in 1439, which John attended with 700 followers including Patriarch Joseph II of Constantinople and George Gemistos Plethon, a Neoplatonist philosopher influential among the academics of Italy. The union failed due to opposition in Constantinople, but through his prudent conduct towards the Ottoman Empire he succeeded in holding possession of the city.\nJohn VIII Palaiologos named his brother Constantine XI, who had served as regent in Constantinople in 1437\u20131439, as his successor. Despite the machinations of his younger brother Demetrios Palaiologos his mother Helena was able to secure Constantine XI's succession in 1448.\nJohn VIII died at Constantinople in 1448, becoming the last reigning Byzantine emperor to die of natural causes, and was buried in the Pantokrator Monastery.\nMarriages.\nJohn VIII Palaiologos was married three times. His first marriage was in 1414 to Anna of Moscow, daughter of Grand Prince Basil I of Moscow (1389\u20131425) and Sophia of Lithuania. She died in August 1417 of plague.\nThe second marriage, arranged by his father Manuel II and Pope Martin V, was to Sophia of Montferrat in 1421. She was a daughter of Theodore II, Marquess of Montferrat, and his second wife Joanna of Bar. Joanna was a daughter of Robert I, Duke of Bar, and Marie de Valois. Her maternal grandparents were John II of France and Bonne of Bohemia.\nHis third marriage, arranged by the future cardinal, Bessarion, was to Maria of Trebizond in 1427. She was a daughter of Alexios IV of Trebizond and Theodora Kantakouzene. She died in the winter of 1439, also from plague. None of the marriages produced any children.\nRepresentation in art.\nJohn VIII Palaiologos was famously depicted by several painters on the occasion of his visit to Italy. Perhaps the most famous of his portraits is the one by Benozzo Gozzoli, on the southern wall of the Magi Chapel, at the Palazzo Medici-Riccardi, in Florence. According to some interpretations, John VIII was also portrayed in Piero della Francesca's \"Flagellation\". A portrait of John appears in a manuscript at the Saint Catherine's Monastery in the Sinai Peninsula.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

To generate income, in 1713 the company was granted a monopoly (the \"Asiento de Negros\") to supply African slaves to the islands in the \"South Seas\" and South America. When the company was created, Britain was involved in the War of the Spanish Succession and Spain and Portugal controlled most of South America. There was thus no realistic prospect that trade would take place, and as it turned out, the Company never realised any significant profit from its monopoly. However, Company stock rose greatly in value as it expanded its operations dealing in government debt, and peaked in 1720 before suddenly collapsing to little above its original flotation price. The notorious economic bubble thus created, which ruined thousands of investors, became known as the South Sea Bubble.\nThe Bubble Act 1720 (6 Geo. 1 c. 18), which forbade the creation of joint-stock companies without royal charter, was promoted by the South Sea Company itself before its collapse.\nIn Great Britain, many investors were ruined by the share-price collapse, and as a result, the national economy diminished substantially. The founders of the scheme engaged in insider trading, by using their advance knowledge of the timings of national debt consolidations to make large profits from purchasing debt in advance. Huge bribes were given to politicians to support the acts of Parliament necessary for the scheme. Company money was used to deal in its own shares, and selected individuals purchasing shares were given cash loans backed by those same shares to spend on purchasing more shares. The expectation of profits from trade with South America was talked up to encourage the public to purchase shares, but the bubble prices reached far beyond what the actual profits of the business (namely the slave trade) could justify.\nA parliamentary inquiry was held after the bursting of the bubble to discover its causes. A number of politicians were disgraced, and people found to have profited unlawfully from the company had personal assets confiscated proportionate to their gains (most had already been rich and remained so). Finally, the Company was restructured and continued to operate for more than a century after the Bubble. The headquarters were in Threadneedle Street, at the centre of the City of London, the financial district of the capital. At the time of these events, the Bank of England was also a private company dealing in national debt, and the crash of its rival confirmed its position as banker to the British government.\nFoundation.\nWhen in August 1710 Robert Harley was appointed Chancellor of the Exchequer, the government had already become reliant on the Bank of England, a privately owned company chartered 16 years previously, which had obtained a monopoly as the lender to the government. The government had become dissatisfied with the service it was receiving and Harley was actively seeking new ways to improve the national finances.\nA new parliament met in November 1710 resolved to attend to the national finances, which were suffering from the pressures of two simultaneous wars: the War of the Spanish Succession with France, which ended in 1713, and the Great Northern War, which was not to end until 1721. Harley came prepared, with detailed accounts describing the situation of the national debt, which was customarily a piecemeal arrangement, with each government department borrowing independently as the need arose. He released the information steadily, continually adding new reports of debts incurred and scandalous expenditure, until in January 1711 the House of Commons agreed to appoint a committee to investigate the entire debt. The committee included Harley himself, the two Auditors of the Imprests (whose task was to investigate government spending), Edward Harley (the Chancellor's brother), Paul Foley (the Chancellor's brother-in-law), the Secretary of the Treasury, William Lowndes (who had had significant responsibility for reminting the entire debased British coinage in 1696) and John Aislabie (who represented the October Club, a group of about 200 MPs who had agreed to vote together).\nHarley's first concern was to find \u00a3300,000 for the next quarter's payroll for the British army operating on the Continent under the Duke of Marlborough. This funding was provided by a private consortium of Edward Gibbon (grandfather of ), George Caswall, and Hoare's Bank. The Bank of England had been operating a lottery on behalf of the government, but in 1710 this had produced less revenue than expected and another begun in 1711 was also performing poorly; Harley granted the authority to sell tickets to John Blunt, a director of the Hollow Sword Blade Company, which despite its name was an unofficial bank. Sales commenced on 3 March 1711 and tickets had completely sold out by 7 March, making it the first truly successful English state lottery.\nThe success was shortly followed by another larger lottery, \"The Two Million Adventure\" or \"The Classis\", with tickets costing \u00a3100, with a top prize of \u00a320,000 and every ticket winning a prize of at least \u00a310. Although prizes were advertised by their total value, they were in fact paid out by instalments in the form of a fixed annuity over a period of years, so that the government effectively held the prize money as borrowings until the whole value had been paid out to the winners. Marketing was handled by members of the Sword Blade syndicate, Gibbon selling \u00a3200,000 of tickets and earning \u00a34,500 commission, and Blunt selling \u00a3993,000. Charles Blunt (a relative) was made Paymaster of the lottery with expenses of \u00a35,000.\nConception of the company.\nThe national debt investigation concluded that a total of \u00a39 million was owed by the government, with no specifically allocated income to pay it off. Robert Harley and John Blunt had jointly devised a scheme to consolidate this debt in much the same way that the Bank of England had consolidated previous debts, although the Bank still held the monopoly for operating as a bank. All holders of the debt (creditors) would be required to surrender it to a new company formed for the purpose, the South Sea Company, which in return would issue them shares in itself to the same nominal value. The government would make an annual payment to the Company of \u00a3568,279, equating to 6% interest plus expenses, which would then be redistributed to the shareholders as a dividend. The company was also granted a monopoly to trade with South America, a potentially lucrative enterprise, but one controlled by Spain \u2013 with which Britain was at war.\nAt that time, when the continent of America was being explored and colonised, Europeans applied the term \"South Seas\" only to South America and surrounding waters. The concession both held out the potential for future profits and encouraged a desire for an end to the war, necessary if any profits were to be made. The original suggestion for the South Sea scheme came from William Paterson, one of the founders of the Bank of England and of the financially disastrous Darien Scheme.\nHarley was rewarded for delivering the scheme by being created Earl of Oxford on 23 May 1711 and was promoted to Lord High Treasurer. With a more secure position, he began secret peace negotiations with France.\nInitial speculation.\nThe scheme to thus consolidate all government debt and to manage it better in the future held out the prospect of all existing creditors being repaid the full nominal value of their loans, which at the time before the scheme was publicised were valued at a discounted rate of \u00a355 per \u00a3100 nominal value, as the lotteries were discredited. The government's ability to repay in full was widely doubted. Thus bonds representing the debt intended to be consolidated under the scheme were available for purchase on the open market at a price that allowed anyone with advance knowledge to buy and resell in the immediate future at a high profit, for as soon as the scheme became publicised the bonds would once again be worth at least their nominal value, as repayment was now more certain a prospect. This anticipation of gain made it possible for Harley to bring further financial supporters into the scheme, such as James Bateman and Theodore Janssen.\nDaniel Defoe commented:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Unless the Spaniards are to be divested of common sense, infatuate, and given up, abandoning their own commerce, throwing away the only valuable stake they have left in the world, and in short, bent on their own ruin, we cannot suggest that they will ever, on any consideration, or for any equivalent, part with so valuable, indeed so inestimable a jewel, as the exclusive trade to their own plantations.\u2014\u200a\nThe originators of the scheme knew that there was no money to invest in a trading venture, and no realistic expectation that there would ever be a trade to exploit, but nevertheless, the potential for great wealth was widely publicised at every opportunity, so as to encourage interest in the scheme. The founders' objective was to create a company that would enable them to become wealthy and offer opportunities for further government contracts.\nFlotation.\nThe royal charter for the company, based on that of the Bank of England, was drawn up by Blunt who was paid \u00a33,846 for his services in setting up the company. Directors would be elected every three years and shareholders would meet twice a year. The company employed a cashier, secretary and accountant. The governor was intended as an honorary position, and was later customarily held by the monarch. The charter allowed the full court of directors to nominate a smaller committee to act on any matter on its behalf. Directors of the Bank of England and of the East India Company were barred from being directors of the South Sea Company. Any ship of more than 500 tons owned by the company was to have a Church of England clergyman on board.\nThe surrender of government debt for company stock was to occur in five separate lots. The first two of these, totaling \u00a32.75 million from about 200 large investors, had already been arranged before the company's charter was issued on 10 September 1711. The government itself surrendered \u00a30.75 million of its own debt held by different departments (at that time individual office holders were at liberty to invest government funds under their control to their own advantage before it was required for government expenditure). Harley surrendered \u00a38,000 of debt and was appointed Governor of the new company. Blunt, Caswall and Sawbridge together surrendered \u00a365,000, Janssen \u00a325,000 of his own plus \u00a3250,000 from a foreign consortium, Decker \u00a349,000, Sir Ambrose Crawley \u00a336,791. The company had a Sub-Governor, Bateman; a Deputy Governor, Ongley; and 30 ordinary directors. In total, nine of the directors were politicians, five were members of the Sword Blade consortium, and seven more were financial magnates who had been attracted to the scheme.\nThe company created a coat of arms with the motto \"A Gadibus usque ad Auroram\" (\"From C\u00e1diz to Dawn\", from Juvenal, Satires, 10) and rented a large house in the City of London as its headquarters. Seven sub-committees were created to handle its everyday business, the most important being the \"committee for the affairs of the company\". The Sword Blade company was retained as the company's banker and on the strength of its new government connections issued notes in its own right, notwithstanding the Bank of England's monopoly. The task of the Company Secretary was to oversee trading activities; the Accountant, Grigsby, was responsible for registering and issuing stock; and the Cashier, Robert Knight, acted as Blunt's personal assistant at a salary of \u00a3200 per annum.\nThe slave trade.\nThe Treaty of Utrecht of 1713 granted Britain an \"Asiento de Negros\" lasting 30 years to supply the Spanish colonies with 4,800 enslaved Africans (\"slaves\") per year. Britain was permitted to open offices in Buenos Aires, Caracas, Cartagena, Havana, Panama, Portobello and Veracruz to arrange the Atlantic slave trade. One ship of no more than 500 tons could be sent to one of these places each year (the \"Nav\u00edo de Permiso\") with general trade goods. One quarter of the profits were to be reserved for the King of Spain. There was provision for two extra sailings at the start of the contract. The Asiento was granted in the name of Queen Anne and then contracted to the company.\nBy July the company had arranged contracts with the Royal African Company to supply the necessary African slaves to Jamaica. Ten pounds was paid for a slave aged over 16, \u00a38 for one under 16 but over 10. Two-thirds were to be male, and 90% adult. The company trans-shipped 1,230 slaves from Jamaica to America in the first year, plus any that might have been added (against standing instructions) by the ship's captains on their own behalf. On arrival of the first cargoes, the local authorities refused to accept the Asiento, which had still not been officially confirmed there by the Spanish authorities. The slaves were eventually sold at a loss in the West Indies.\nIn 1714 the government announced that a quarter of profits would be reserved for Queen Anne and a further 7.5% for a financial adviser, Manasseh Gilligan. Some company board members refused to accept the contract on these terms, and the government was obliged to reverse its decision.\nDespite these setbacks, the company continued, having raised \u00a3200,000 to finance the operations. In 1714 2,680 slaves were carried, and for 1716\u201317, 13,000 more, but the trade continued to be unprofitable. An import duty of 33 pieces of eight was charged on each slave (although for this purpose some slaves might be counted only as a fraction of a slave, depending on quality). One of the extra trade ships was sent to Cartagena in 1714 carrying woollen goods, despite warnings that there was no market for them there, and they remained unsold for two years.\nIt has been estimated that the company transported a little over 34,000 slaves with mortality losses comparable to its competitors, showing that slave trading was a significant part of the company's work, and that it was carried out to the standards of the day. Its trading activities therefore offered a financial motivation for investment in the company.\nChanges of management.\nThe company was heavily dependent on the goodwill of government; when the government changed, so too did the company board. In 1714 one of the directors who had been sponsored by Harley, Arthur Moore, had attempted to send 60 tons of private goods on board the company ship. He was dismissed as a director, but the result was the beginning of Harley's fall from favour with the company. On 27 July 1714, Harley was replaced as Lord High Treasurer as a result of a disagreement that had broken out within the Tory faction in Parliament. Queen Anne died on 1 August 1714; and at the election of directors in 1715 the Prince of Wales (the future King George II) was elected as governor of the company. The new King George I and the Prince of Wales both had large holdings in the company, as did some prominent Whig politicians, including James Craggs the Elder, the Earl of Halifax and Sir Joseph Jekyll. James Craggs, as Postmaster General, was responsible for intercepting mail on behalf of the government to obtain political and financial information. All Tory politicians were removed from the board and replaced with businessmen. The Whigs Horatio Townshend, brother in law of Robert Walpole, and the Duke of Argyll were elected directors.\nThe change of government led to a revival of the company's share value, which had fallen below its issue price. The previous government had failed to make the interest payments to the company for the preceding two years, owing more than \u00a31 million. The new administration insisted that the debt be written off, but allowed the company to issue new shares to stockholders to the value of the missed payments. At around \u00a310 million, this now represented half the share capital issued in the entire country. In 1714 the company had 2,000 to 3,000 shareholders, more than either of its rivals.\nBy the time of the next directors' elections in 1718 politics had changed again, with a schism within the Whigs between Walpole's faction supporting the Prince of Wales and James Stanhope's supporting the King. Argyll and Townshend were dismissed as directors, as were surviving Tories Sir Richard Hoare and George Pitt, and King George I became governor. Four MPs remained directors, as did six people holding government financial offices. The Sword Blade Company remained bankers to the South Sea, and indeed had flourished despite the company's dubious legal position. Blunt and Sawbridge remained South Sea directors, and they had been joined by Gibbon and Child. Caswall had retired as a South Sea director to concentrate on the Sword Blade business. In November 1718 Sub-Governor Bateman and Deputy Governor Shepheard both died. Leaving aside the honorary position of Governor, this left the company suddenly without its two most senior and experienced directors. They were replaced by Sir John Fellowes as Sub-Governor and Charles Joye as Deputy.\nWar.\nIn 1718 war broke out with Spain once again, in the War of the Quadruple Alliance. The company's assets in South America were seized, at a cost claimed by the company to be \u00a3300,000. Any prospect of profit from trade, for which the company had purchased ships and had been planning its next ventures, disappeared.\nRefinancing government debt.\nEvents in France now came to influence the future of the company. A Scottish economist and financier, John Law, exiled after killing a man in a duel, had travelled around Europe before settling in France. There he founded a bank, which in December 1718 became the Banque Royale, national bank of France, while Law himself was granted sweeping powers to control the economy of France, which operated largely by royal decree. Law's remarkable success was known in financial circles throughout Europe, and now came to inspire Blunt and his associates to make greater efforts to grow their own concerns.\nIn February 1719 Craggs explained to the House of Commons a new scheme for improving the national debt by converting the annuities issued after the 1710 lottery into South Sea stock. By an act of Parliament, the National Debt Act 1719 (6 Geo. 1. c. 4), the company was granted the right to issue \u00a31,150 of new stock for every \u00a3100 per annum of annuity which was surrendered. The government would pay 5% per annum on the stock created, which would halve their annual bill. The conversion was voluntary, amounting to \u00a32.5 million new stock if all converted. The company was to make an additional new loan to the government pro rata up to \u00a3750,000, again at 5%.\nIn March there was an abortive attempt to restore the Old Pretender, James Edward Stuart, to the throne of Britain, with a small landing of troops in Scotland. They were defeated at the Battle of Glen Shiel on 10 June. The South Sea company presented the offer to the public in July 1719. The Sword Blade company spread a rumour that the Pretender had been captured, and the general euphoria induced the South Sea share price to rise from \u00a3100, where it had been in the spring, to \u00a3114. Annuitants were still paid out at the same money value of shares, the company keeping the profit from the rise in value before issuing. About two-thirds of the in-force annuities were exchanged.\nTrading more debt for equity.\nThe 1719 scheme was a distinct success from the government's perspective, and they sought to repeat it. Negotiations took place between Aislabie and Craggs for the government and Blunt, Cashier Knight and his assistant and Caswell. Janssen, the Sub Governor and Deputy Governor were also consulted but negotiations remained secret from most of the company. News from France was of fortunes being made investing in Law's bank, whose shares had risen sharply. Money was moving around Europe, and other flotations threatened to soak up available capital (two insurance schemes in December 1719 each sought to raise \u00a33 million).\nPlans were made for a new scheme to take over most of the unconsolidated national debt of Britain (\u00a330,981,712) in exchange for company shares. Annuities were valued as a lump sum necessary to produce the annual income over the original term at an assumed interest of 5%, which favoured those with shorter terms still to run. The government agreed to pay the same amount to the company for all the fixed-term repayable debt as it had been paying before, but after seven years the 5% interest rate would fall to 4% on both the new annuity debt and also that assumed previously. After the first year, the company was to give the government \u00a33 million in four quarterly instalments. New stock would be created at a face value equal to the debt, but the share price was still rising and sales of the remaining stock, i.e. the excess of the total market value of the stock over the amount of the debt, would be used to raise the government fee plus a profit for the company. The more the price rose in advance of conversion, the more the company would make. Before the scheme, payments were costing the government \u00a31.5 million per year.\nIn summary, the total government debt in 1719 was \u00a350 million:\nThe purpose of this conversion was similar to the old one: debt holders and annuitants might receive less return in total, but an illiquid investment was transformed into shares that could be readily traded. Shares backed by national debt were considered a safe investment and a convenient way to hold and move money, far easier and safer than metal coins. The only alternative safe asset, land, was much harder to sell and transfer of its ownership was legally much more complex.\nThe government received a cash payment and lower overall interest on the debt. Importantly, it also gained control over when the debt had to be repaid, which was not before seven years but then at its discretion. This avoided the risk that debt might become repayable at some future point just when the government needed to borrow more, and could be forced into paying higher interest rates. The payment to the government was to be used to buy in any debt not subscribed to the scheme, which although it helped the government, also helped the company by removing possibly competing securities from the market, including large holdings by the Bank of England.\nCompany stock was now trading at \u00a3123, so the issue amounted to an injection of \u00a35 million of new money into a booming economy just as interest rates were falling. Gross Domestic Product (GDP) for Britain at this point was estimated as \u00a364.4 million.\nPublic announcement.\nOn 21 January the plan was presented to the board of the South Sea Company, and on 22 January Chancellor of the Exchequer John Aislabie presented it to Parliament. The House was stunned into silence, but on recovering proposed that the Bank of England should be invited to make a better offer. In response, the South Sea increased its cash payment to \u00a33.5 million, while the Bank proposed to undertake the conversion with a payment of \u00a35.5 million and a fixed conversion price of \u00a3170 per \u00a3100 face-value Bank stock. On 1 February, the company negotiators led by Blunt raised their offer to \u00a34 million plus a proportion of \u00a33.5 million depending on how much of the debt was converted. They also agreed that the interest rate would decrease after four years instead of seven, and agreed to sell on behalf of the government \u00a31 million of Exchequer bills (formerly handled by the Bank). The House accepted the South Sea offer. Bank stock fell sharply.\nPerhaps the first sign of difficulty came when the South Sea Company announced that its Christmas 1719 dividend would be deferred for 12 months. The company now embarked on a show of gratitude to its friends. Select individuals were sold a parcel of company stock at the current price. The transactions were recorded by Knight in the names of intermediaries, but no payments were received and no stock issued \u2013 indeed the company had none to issue until the conversion of debt began. The individual received an option to sell his stock back to the company at any future date at whatever market price might then apply. Shares went to the Craggs: the Elder and the Younger; Lord Gower; Lord Lansdowne; and four other MPs. Lord Sunderland would gain \u00a3500 for every pound that stock rose; George I's mistress, their children and Countess Platen \u00a3120 per pound rise, Aislabie \u00a3200 per pound, Lord Stanhope \u00a3600 per pound. Others invested money, including the Treasurer to the Navy, Hampden, who invested \u00a325,000 of government money on his own behalf.\nThe proposal was accepted in a slightly altered form in April 1720. Crucial in this conversion was the proportion of holders of irredeemable annuities who could be tempted to convert their securities at a high price for the new shares. (Holders of redeemable debt had effectively no other choice but to subscribe.) The South Sea Company could set the conversion price but could not diverge much from the market price of its shares. The company ultimately acquired 85% of the redeemables and 80% of the irredeemables.\nInflating the share price.\nThe company then set to talking up its stock with \"the most extravagant rumours\" of the value of its potential trade in the New World; this was followed by a wave of \"speculating frenzy\". The share price had risen from the time the scheme was proposed: from \u00a3128 in January 1720, to \u00a3175 in February, \u00a3330 in March and, following the scheme's acceptance, \u00a3550 at the end of May.\nWhat may have supported the company's high multiples (its P/E ratio) was a fund of credit (known to the market) of \u00a370 million available for commercial expansion which had been made available through substantial support, apparently, by Parliament and the King.\nShares in the company were \"sold\" to politicians at the current market price; however, rather than paying for the shares, these recipients simply held the shares, with the option of selling them back to the company at any time, receiving the increase in market price. This method, as well as winning over the heads of government, the King's mistress, \"et al.\", had the advantage of binding their interests to the interests of the company: in order to secure profits, the stock needed to rise. Meanwhile, by publicising the names of their elite stockholders, the company managed to clothe itself in an aura of legitimacy, which attracted and kept other buyers.\nBubble Act.\nThe South Sea Company was by no means the only company seeking to raise money from investors in 1720. A large number of other joint-stock companies, making extravagant (sometimes fraudulent) claims about foreign or other ventures or bizarre schemes, had been created. Others represented potentially sound, although novel, schemes, such as for founding insurance companies. These were nicknamed \"Bubbles\". Some of the companies had no legal basis, while others (such as the Hollow Sword Blade Company, which acted as the South Sea Company's banker), used existing chartered companies for purposes entirely different from those designated at their creation. The York Buildings Company was set up to provide water to London, but was purchased by Case Billingsley who used it to purchase confiscated Jacobite estates in Scotland, which then formed the assets of an insurance company.\nOn 22 February 1720, John Hungerford raised the question of bubble companies in the House of Commons, and persuaded the House to set up a committee, which he chaired, to investigate. He identified a number of companies which between them sought to raise \u00a340 million in capital. The committee investigated the companies, establishing a principle that companies should not be operating outside the objects specified in their charters. A potential embarrassment for the South Sea was avoided when the question of the Hollow Sword Blade Company arose. Difficulty was avoided by flooding the committee with MPs who were supporters of the South Sea, and voting down by 75 to 25 the proposal to investigate the Hollow Sword. (At this time, committees of the House were either 'Open' or 'secret'. A secret committee was one with a fixed set of members who could vote on its proceedings. By contrast, any MP could join in with an 'open' committee and vote on its proceedings.) Stanhope, who was a member of the committee, received \u00a350,000 of the 'resaleable' South Sea stock from Sawbridge, a director of the Hollow Sword, at about this time. Hungerford had previously been expelled from the Commons for accepting a bribe.\nAmongst the bubble companies investigated were two supported by Lords Onslow and Chetwynd respectively, for insuring shipping. These were criticised heavily, and the questionable dealings of the Attorney-General and Solicitor-General in trying to obtain charters for the companies led to both being replaced. However, the schemes had the support of Walpole and Craggs, so that the larger part of the Bubble Act 1720 (6 Geo. 1. c. 18) (which finally resulted in June 1720 from the committee's investigations) was devoted to creating charters for the Royal Exchange Assurance Corporation or London Assurance Corporation. The companies were required to pay \u00a3300,000 for the privilege. The act required that a joint stock company could be incorporated only by act of Parliament or royal charter. The prohibition on unauthorised joint stock ventures was not repealed until 1825.\nThe passing of the act gave a boost to the South Sea Company, its shares leaping to \u00a3890 in early June. This peak encouraged people to start to sell; to counterbalance this the company's directors ordered their agents to buy, which succeeded in propping the price up at around \u00a3750.\nTop reached.\nThe price of the stock went up over the course of a single year from about \u00a3100 to almost \u00a31,000 per share. Its success caused a country-wide frenzy\u2014herd behaviour\u2014as all types of people, from peasants to lords, developed a feverish interest in investing: in South Seas primarily, but in stocks generally. One famous apocryphal story is of a company that went public in 1720 as \"a company for carrying out an undertaking of great advantage, but nobody to know what it is\".\nThe price finally reached \u00a31,000 in early August 1720, and the level of selling was such that the price started to fall, dropping back to \u00a3100 per share before the year was out. This triggered bankruptcies amongst those who had bought on credit, and increased sales, including short selling (i.e., selling borrowed shares in the hope of buying them back at a profit if the price fell).\nAlso, in August 1720, the first of the instalment payments of the first and second money subscriptions on new issues of South Sea stock were due. Earlier in the year John Blunt had come up with an idea to prop up the share price: the company would lend people money to buy its shares. As a result, many shareholders could not pay for their shares except by selling them.\nFurthermore, a scramble for liquidity appeared internationally as \"bubbles\" were also ending in Amsterdam and Paris. The collapse coincided with the fall of the Mississippi Company of John Law in France. As a result, the price of South Sea shares began to decline.\nRecriminations.\nBy the end of September the stock had fallen to \u00a3150. Company failures now extended to banks and goldsmiths, as they could not collect loans made on the stock, and thousands of individuals were ruined, including many members of the British elite. With investors outraged, Parliament was recalled in December and an investigation began. Reporting in 1721, it revealed widespread fraud amongst the company directors and corruption in the Cabinet. Among those implicated were John Aislabie (the Chancellor of the Exchequer), James Craggs the Elder (the Postmaster General), James Craggs the Younger (the Southern Secretary), and even Lord Stanhope and Lord Sunderland (the heads of the Ministry). Craggs the Elder and Craggs the Younger both died in disgrace; the remainder were impeached for their corruption. The Commons found Aislabie guilty of the \"most notorious, dangerous and infamous corruption\", and he was imprisoned. The corruption around the South Sea bubble was the impetus for the writing and publication of Cato's Letters which became an important work first for the Radical Whigs and then into the libertarian ideology of the American Revolution.\nThe newly appointed First Lord of the Treasury, Robert Walpole, successfully restored public confidence in the financial system. However, public opinion, as shaped by the many prominent men who lost money, demanded revenge. Walpole supervised the process, which removed all 33 of the company directors and stripped them of, on average, 82% of their wealth. The money went to the victims and the stock of the South Sea Company was divided between the Bank of England and the East India Company. Walpole made sure that King George and his mistresses were protected, and by a margin of three votes he managed to save several key government officials from impeachment. In the process, Walpole won plaudits as the saviour of the financial system while establishing himself as the dominant figure in British politics; historians credit him for rescuing the Whig government, and indeed the Hanoverian dynasty, from total disgrace.\nQuotations prompted by the collapse.\nJoseph Spence wrote that Lord Radnor reported to him \"When Sir Isaac Newton was asked about the continuance of the rising of South Sea stock\u00a0... He answered 'that he could not calculate the madness of people'.\" He is also quoted as stating, \"I can calculate the movement of the stars, but not the madness of men\". Newton himself owned nearly \u00a322,000 in South Sea stock in 1722, but it is not known how much he lost, if anything. There are, however, numerous sources stating he lost up to \u00a320,000 (equivalent to \u00a3 in 2023).\nA trading company.\nThe South Sea Company was created in 1711 to reduce the size of public debts, but was granted the commercial privilege of exclusive rights of trade to the Spanish Indies, based on the treaty of commerce signed by Britain and the Archduke Charles, candidate to the Spanish throne during the War of the Spanish Succession. After Philip V became the King of Spain, Britain obtained at the 1713 Treaty of Utrecht the rights to the slave trade to the Spanish Indies (or Asiento de Negros) for 30 years. Those rights were previously held by the Compagnie de Guin\u00e9e et de l'Assiente du Royaume de la France.\nThe South Sea Company board opposed taking on the slave trade, which had shown little profitability when chartered companies had engaged in it. To increase the profitability, the Asiento contract included the right to send one yearly 500-ton ship to the fairs at Portobello and Veracruz loaded with duty-free merchandises, called the \"Nav\u00edo de Permiso\". The Crown of England and the King of Spain were each entitled to 25% of the profits, according to the terms of the contract, that was a copy of the French Asiento contract, but Queen Anne soon renounced her share. The King of Spain did not receive any payments due to him, and this was one of the sources of contention between the Spanish Crown and the South Sea Company.\nAs was the case for previous holders of the Asiento, the Portuguese and the French, the profit was not in the slave trade but in the illegal contraband goods smuggled in the slave ships and in the annual ship. Those goods were sold at the Spanish colonies at a handsome price, for they were in high demand; and constituted unfair competition with taxed goods, proving a large drain on the Spanish Crown's trade income. The relationship between the South Sea Company and the Government of Spain was always bad, and worsened with time. The company complained of searches and seizures of goods, lack of profitability, and confiscation of properties during the wars between Britain and Spain of 1718\u20131723 and 1727\u20131729, during which the operations of the company were suspended. The Government of Spain complained of the illegal trade, failure of the company to present its accounts as stipulated by the contract, and non-payment of the King's share of the profits. These claims were a major cause of deteriorating relations between the two countries in 1738; and although the Prime Minister Walpole opposed war, there was strong support for it from the King, the House of Commons, and a faction in his own Cabinet. Walpole was able to negotiate a treaty with the King of Spain at the Convention of Pardo in January 1739 that stipulated that Spain would pay British merchants \u00a395,000 in compensation for captures and seized goods, while the South Sea Company would pay the Spanish Crown \u00a368,000 in due proceeds from the Asiento. The South Sea Company refused to pay those proceeds and the King of Spain retained payment of the compensation until payment from the South Sea Company could be secured. The break-up of relations between the South Sea Company and the Spanish Government was a prelude to the \"Guerra del Asiento\", as the first Royal Navy fleets departed in July 1739 for the Caribbean, prior to the declaration of war, which lasted from October 1739 until 1748. This war is known as the War of Jenkins' Ear.\nSlave trade under the Asiento.\nUnder the Treaty of Tordesillas, Spain was the only European power that could not establish factories in Africa to purchase slaves. The slaves for Spanish America were provided by companies that were granted exclusive rights to their trade. This monopoly contract was called the slave Asiento. Between 1701 and 1713 the Asiento contract was granted to France. In 1711 Britain had created the South Sea Company to reduce debt and to trade with Spanish America, but that commerce was illegal without a permit from Spain, and the only existing permit was the Asiento for the slave trade, so at the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713 Britain obtained the transfer of the Asiento contract from French to British hands for the next 30 years.\nThe board of directors was reluctant to take on the slave trade, which was not an object of the company and had shown little profitability when carried out by chartered companies, but they finally agreed on 26 March 1714. The Asiento set a sale quota of 4,800 units of slaves per year. An adult male slave counted as one unit; females and children counted as fractions of a unit. Initially the slaves were provided by the Royal African Company.\nThe South Sea Company established slave reception factories at Cartagena, Colombia, Veracruz, Mexico, Panama, Portobello, La Guaira, Buenos Aires, La Havana and Santiago de Cuba, and slave deposits at Jamaica and Barbados. Despite problems with speculation, the South Sea Company was relatively successful at slave trading and meeting its quota (it was unusual for other, similarly chartered companies to fulfill their quotas). According to records compiled by David Eltis and others, during the course of 96 voyages in 25 years, the South Sea Company purchased 34,000 slaves, of whom 30,000 survived the voyage across the Atlantic. (Thus about 11% of the slaves died on the voyage: a relatively low mortality rate for the Middle Passage.) The company persisted with the slave trade through two wars with Spain and the calamitous 1720 commercial bubble. The company's slave trading peaked during 1725, five years after the bubble burst.\nThe annual ship.\nThe slave Asiento contract of 1713 granted a permit to send one vessel of 500 tons per year, loaded with duty-free merchandise to be sold at the fairs of New Spain, Cartagena and Portobello. This was an unprecedented concession that broke two centuries of strict exclusion of foreign merchants from the Spanish Empire, although a quarter of the profit was to be paid to the Spanish Crown.\nThe first ship to head for the Americas, the \"Royal Prince\", was scheduled for 1714 but was delayed until August 1716. In consideration of the three annual ships missed since the date of the Asiento, the permitted tonnage of the next ten ships was raised to 650. Only seven annual ships sailed during the Asiento, the last one being the \"Royal Caroline\" in 1732. The company's failure to produce accounts for all the annual ships but the first one, and lack of payment of the proceeds to the Spanish Crown from the profits for all the annual ships, resulted in no permits being granted after the \"Royal Caroline\" trip of 1732\u20131734.\nIn contrast to the \"legitimate\" trade in slaves, the regular trade of the annual ships generated healthy returns, in some case profits were over 100%. Accounts for the voyage of the \"Royal Prince\" were not presented until 1733, following continuous demands by Spanish officials. They reported profits of \u00a343,607. Since the King of Spain was entitled to 25% of the profits, after deducting interest on a loan he claimed \u00a38,678. The South Sea Company never paid the amount due for the first annual ship to the Spanish Crown, nor did it pay any amount for any of the other six trips.\nArctic whaling.\nThe Greenland Company had been established by an act of Parliament, the Greenland Trade Act 1692 (4 Will. &amp; Mar. c. 17) in 1693 with the object of catching whales in the Arctic. The products of their \"whale-fishery\" were to be free of customs and other duties. Partly due to maritime disruption caused by wars with France, the Greenland Company failed financially within a few years. In 1722 Henry Elking published a proposal, directed at the governors of the South Sea Company, that they should resume the \"Greenland Trade\" and send ships to catch whales in the Arctic. He made very detailed suggestions about how the ships should be crewed and equipped.\nThe British Parliament confirmed that a British Arctic \"whale-fishery\" would continue to benefit from freedom from customs duties, and in 1724 the South Sea Company decided to commence whaling. They had 12 whale-ships built on the River Thames and these went to the Greenland seas in 1725. Further ships were built in later years, but the venture was not successful. There were hardly any experienced whalemen remaining in Britain, and the company had to engage Dutch and Danish whalemen for the key posts aboard their ships: for instance all commanding officers and harpooners were hired from the North Frisian island of F\u00f6hr. Other costs were badly controlled and the catches remained disappointingly few, even though the company was sending up to 25 ships to Davis Strait and the Greenland seas in some years. By 1732 the company had accumulated a net loss of \u00a3177,782 from their eight years of Arctic whaling.\nThe South Sea Company directors appealed to the British government for further support. Parliament had passed an act of Parliament in 1732 that extended the duty-free concessions for a further nine years. In 1733 the Whale Fishery Act 1732 (6 Geo. 2. c. 33) was passed that also granted a government subsidy to British Arctic whalers, the first in a long series of such acts of Parliament that continued and modified the whaling subsidies throughout the 18th century. This, and the subsequent acts, required the whalers to meet conditions regarding the crewing and equipping of the whale-ships that closely resembled the conditions suggested by Elking in 1722. In spite of the extended duty-free concessions, and the prospect of real subsidies as well, the court and directors of the South Sea Company decided that they could not expect to make profits from Arctic whaling. They sent out no more whale-ships after the loss-making 1732 season.\nGovernment debt after the Seven Years' War.\nThe company continued its trade (when not interrupted by war) until the end of the Seven Years' War (1756\u20131763). However, its main function was always managing government debt, rather than trading with the Spanish colonies. The South Sea Company continued its management of part of the national debt until it was disestablished in 1853, at which point the debt was reconsolidated. The debt was not paid off by the time of the First World War, at which point it was consolidated again, under terms that allowed the government to avoid repaying the principal.\nArmorials.\nThe armorials of the South Sea Company, according to a grant of arms dated 31 October 1711, were: \"Azure, a globe whereon are represented the Straits of Magellan and Cape Horn all proper and in sinister chief point two herrings haurient in saltire argent crowned or, in a canton the united arms of Great Britain\". Crest: \"A ship of three masts in full sail\". Supporters, dexter: \"The emblematic figure of Britannia, with the shield, lance etc all proper\"; sinister: \"A fisherman completely clothed, with cap boots fishing net etc and in his hand a string of fish, all proper\".\nOfficers of the South Sea Company.\nThe South Sea Company had a governor (generally an honorary position), a subgovernor, a deputy governor and 30 directors \u2013 reduced by the &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Visible anchor/styles.css\" /&gt;South Sea Company Act 1753 (26 Geo. 2. c. 16) to 21 directors.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Gyroplanes and some helicopters also feature horizontal stabilisers as part of their tail assembly. Not all fixed-wing aircraft have tailplanes.Canards, tailless and flying wing aircraft have no separate tailplane, while in V-tail aircraft the vertical stabiliser, rudder, and the tail-plane and elevator are combined to form two diagonal surfaces in a V layout.\nThe function of the tailplane is to provide stability and control. In particular, the tailplane helps adjust for changes in position of the centre of pressure or centre of gravity caused by changes in speed and attitude, fuel consumption, or dropping cargo or payload.\nTailplane types.\nThe tailplane comprises the tail-mounted fixed horizontal stabiliser and movable elevator. Besides its planform, it is characterised by:\nSome locations have been given special names:\nStability.\nA wing with a conventional aerofoil profile makes a negative contribution to longitudinal stability. This means that any disturbance (such as a gust) which raises the nose produces a nose-up pitching moment which tends to raise the nose further. With the same disturbance, the presence of a tailplane produces a restoring nose-down pitching moment, which may counteract the natural instability of the wing and make the aircraft longitudinally stable (in much the same way a weather vane always points into the wind).\nThe longitudinal stability of an aircraft may change when it is flown \"hands-off\"; i.e. when the flight controls are subject to aerodynamic forces but not pilot input forces.\nDamping.\nIn addition to giving a restoring force (which on its own would cause oscillatory motion) a tailplane gives damping. This is caused by the relative wind seen by the tail as the aircraft rotates around the centre of gravity. For example, when the aircraft is oscillating, but is momentarily aligned with the overall vehicle's motion, the tailplane still sees a relative wind that is opposing the oscillation.\nLift.\nDepending on the aircraft design and flight regime, its tailplane may create positive lift or negative lift (downforce). It is sometimes assumed that on a stable aircraft this will always be a net down force, but this is untrue.\nOn some pioneer designs, such as the Bleriot XI, the centre of gravity was between the neutral point and the tailplane, which also provided positive lift. However this arrangement can be unstable and these designs often had severe handling issues. The requirements for stability were not understood until shortly before World War I \u2013 the era within which the British Bristol Scout light biplane was designed for civilian use, with an airfoiled lifting tail throughout its production run into the early World War I years and British military service from 1914 to 1916 \u2013 when it was realised that moving the centre of gravity further forwards allowed the use of a non-lifting tailplane in which the lift is nominally neither positive nor negative but zero, which leads to more stable behaviour. Later examples of aircraft from World War I and onwards into the interwar years that had positive lift tailplanes include, chronologically, the Sopwith Camel, Charles Lindbergh's Spirit of St. Louis, the Gee Bee Model R Racer - all aircraft with a reputation for being difficult to fly, and the easier-to-fly Fleet Finch two-seat Canadian trainer biplane, itself possessing a flat-bottom airfoiled tailplane unit not unlike the earlier Bristol Scout. But with care a lifting tailplane can be made stable. An example is provided by the Bachem Ba 349 Natter VTOL rocket-powered interceptor, which had a lifting tail and was both stable and controllable in flight.\nSome aircraft and flight modes can require the tailplane to generate substantial downforce. This is particularly so when flying slowly and at a high angle of attack (AoA). On some types, the demand in this flight mode has been so extreme that it has caused the tailplane to stall. On the Gloster Meteor T.7 a stall could be triggered by turbulence when the airbrakes were deployed. On the McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II it initially occurred during takeoff and landing approach, and leading-edge slats were fitted to the tailplane upside-down in order to maintain smooth airflow and downforce \"lift\" at high AoA. The Pilatus P-3 trainer required a ventral keel to cure a similar effect when spun, while the McDonnell Douglas T-45 Goshawk suffered excess downwash from the wing when the flaps were deployed, necessitating a small \"SMURF\" surface fixed to the fuselage, such that it aligned with the stabiliser leading-edge root at the critical angle.\nActive stability.\nUsing a computer to control the elevator allows aerodynamically unstable aircraft to be flown in the same manner.\nAircraft such as the F-16 are flown with artificial stability. The advantage of this is a significant reduction in drag caused by the tailplane, and improved manoeuvrability.\nMach tuck.\nAt transonic speeds, an aircraft can experience a shift rearwards in the centre of pressure due to the buildup and movement of shockwaves. This causes a nose-down pitching moment called Mach tuck. Significant trim force may be needed to maintain equilibrium, and this is most often provided using the whole tailplane in the form of an all-flying tailplane or stabilator.\nControl.\nA tailplane usually has some means allowing the pilot to control the amount of lift produced by the tailplane. This in turn causes a nose-up or nose-down pitching moment on the aircraft, which is used to control the aircraft in pitch.\nElevator: A conventional tailplane normally has a hinged aft surface called an elevator,\nStabilator or all-moving tail: In transonic flight shock waves generated by the front of the tailplane render any elevator unusable. An all-moving tail was developed by the British for the Miles M.52, but first saw actual transonic flight on the Bell X-1; Bell Aircraft Corporation had included an elevator trim device that could alter the angle of attack of the entire tailplane. This saved the program from a costly and time-consuming rebuild of the aircraft.\nTransonic and supersonic aircraft now have all-moving tailplanes to counteract Mach tuck and maintain manoeuvrability when flying faster than the critical Mach number. Normally called a stabilator, this configuration is often referred to as an \"all-moving\" or \"all-flying\" tailplane.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It typically causes more than one of the following: an itchy rash, throat closing due to swelling that can obstruct or stop breathing; severe tongue swelling that can also interfere with or stop breathing; shortness of breath, vomiting, lightheadedness, loss of consciousness, low blood pressure, and medical shock. \nThese symptoms typically start in minutes to hours and then increase very rapidly to life-threatening levels. Urgent medical treatment is required to prevent serious harm and death, even if the patient has used an epinephrine autoinjector or has taken other medications in response, and even if symptoms appear to be improving.\nCommon causes include allergies to insect bites and stings, allergies to foods\u2014including nuts, peanuts, milk, fish, shellfish, eggs and some fresh fruits or dried fruits; allergies to sulfites\u2014a class of food preservatives and a byproduct in some fermented foods like vinegar; allergies to medications \u2013 including some antibiotics and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) like aspirin; allergy to general anaesthetic (used to make people sleep during surgery); allergy to contrast agents \u2013 dyes used in some medical tests to help certain areas of the body show up better on scans; allergy to latex \u2013 a type of rubber found in some rubber gloves and condoms. Other causes can include physical exercise, and cases may also occur in some people due to escalating reactions to simple throat irritation or may also occur without an obvious reason. \nAlthough allergic symptoms usually appear after prior sensitization to an allergen, IgE cross-reactivity with homologous proteins can cause reactions upon first exposure to a new substance.\nThe mechanism involves the release of inflammatory mediators in a rapidly escalating cascade from certain types of white blood cells triggered by either immunologic or non-immunologic mechanisms. Diagnosis is based on the presenting symptoms and signs after exposure to a potential allergen or irritant and in some cases, reaction to physical exercise.\nThe primary treatment of anaphylaxis is epinephrine injection into a muscle, intravenous fluids, then placing the person \"in a reclining position with feet elevated to help restore normal blood flow\". Additional doses of epinephrine may be required. Other measures, such as antihistamines and steroids, are complementary. Carrying an epinephrine autoinjector, commonly called an \"epipen\", and identification regarding the condition is recommended in people with a history of anaphylaxis. Immediately contacting ambulance / EMT services is always strongly recommended, regardless of any on-site treatment. Getting to a doctor or hospital as soon as possible is required in all cases, even if it appears to be getting better.\nWorldwide, 0.05\u20132% of the population is estimated to experience anaphylaxis at some point in life. Globally, as underreporting declined into the 2010s, the rate appeared to be increasing. It occurs most often in young people and females. About 99.7% of people hospitalized with anaphylaxis in the United States survive.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nEtymology.\nThe word is derived from , and .\nSigns and symptoms.\nAnaphylaxis typically presents many different symptoms over minutes or hours with an average onset of 5 to 30\u00a0minutes if exposure is intravenous and up to 2\u00a0hours if from eating food. The most common areas affected include: skin (80\u201390%), respiratory (70%), gastrointestinal (30\u201345%), heart and vasculature (10\u201345%), and central nervous system (10\u201315%) with usually two or more being involved.\nSkin.\nSymptoms typically include generalized hives, itchiness, flushing, or swelling (angioedema) of the affected tissues. Those with angioedema may describe a burning sensation of the skin rather than itchiness. Swelling of the tongue or throat occurs in up to about 20% of cases. Other features may include a runny nose and swelling of the conjunctiva. The skin may also be blue tinged because of lack of oxygen.\nRespiratory.\nRespiratory symptoms and signs that may be present include shortness of breath, wheezes, or stridor. The wheezing is typically caused by spasms of the bronchial muscles while stridor is related to upper airway obstruction secondary to swelling. Hoarseness, pain with swallowing, or a cough may also occur.\nCardiovascular.\nWhile a fast heart rate caused by low blood pressure is more common, a Bezold\u2013Jarisch reflex has been described in 10% of people, where a slow heart rate is associated with low blood pressure. A drop in blood pressure or shock (either distributive or cardiogenic) may cause the feeling of lightheadedness or loss of consciousness. Rarely very low blood pressure may be the only sign of anaphylaxis.\nCoronary artery spasm may occur with subsequent myocardial infarction, dysrhythmia, or cardiac arrest. Those with underlying coronary disease are at greater risk of cardiac effects from anaphylaxis. The coronary spasm is related to the presence of histamine-releasing cells in the heart.\nOther.\nGastrointestinal symptoms may include severe crampy abdominal pain and vomiting. There may be confusion, a loss of bladder control or pelvic pain similar to that of uterine cramps. Dilation of blood vessels around the brain may cause headaches. A feeling of anxiety or of \"impending doom\" has also been described.\nCauses.\nAnaphylaxis can occur in response to almost any foreign substance. Common triggers include venom from insect bites or stings, foods, and medication. Foods are the most common trigger in children and young adults, while medications and insect bites and stings are more common in older adults. Less common causes include: physical factors, biological agents such as semen, latex, hormonal changes, food additives and colors, and topical medications. Physical factors such as exercise (known as exercise-induced anaphylaxis) or temperature (either hot or cold) may also act as triggers through their direct effects on mast cells. Events caused by exercise are frequently associated with cofactors such as the ingestion of certain foods or taking an NSAID.Anaphylaxis caused by a combination of exercise and consumption of certain foods is known as food-dependent exercise-induced anaphylaxis (FDEIA). In aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD), alcohol is a common trigger. During anesthesia, neuromuscular blocking agents, antibiotics, and latex are the most common causes. The cause remains unknown in 32\u201350% of cases, referred to as \"idiopathic anaphylaxis.\" Six vaccines (MMR, varicella, influenza, hepatitis B, tetanus, meningococcal) are recognized as a cause for anaphylaxis, and HPV may cause anaphylaxis as well.\nFood and alcohol.\nMany foods can trigger anaphylaxis; this may occur upon the first known ingestion. Common triggering foods vary around the world due to cultural cuisine. In Western cultures, ingestion of or exposure to peanuts, wheat, nuts, certain types of seafood like shellfish, milk, fruit and eggs are the most prevalent causes. Sesame is common in the Middle East, while rice and chickpeas are frequently encountered as sources of anaphylaxis in Asia. Severe cases are usually caused by ingesting the allergen, but some people experience a severe reaction upon contact. Children can outgrow their allergies. By age 16, 80% of children with anaphylaxis to milk or eggs and 20% who experience isolated anaphylaxis to peanuts can tolerate these foods. Any type of alcohol, even in small amounts, can trigger anaphylaxis in people with AERD.\nMedication.\nAny medication may potentially trigger anaphylaxis. The most common are \u03b2-lactam antibiotics (such as penicillin) followed by aspirin and NSAIDs. Other antibiotics are implicated less frequently. Anaphylactic reactions to NSAIDs are either agent specific or occur among those that are structurally similar meaning that those who are allergic to one NSAID can typically tolerate a different one or different group of NSAIDs. Other relatively common causes include chemotherapy, vaccines, protamine and herbal preparations. Some medications (vancomycin, morphine, x-ray contrast among others) cause anaphylaxis by directly triggering mast cell degranulation.\nThe frequency of a reaction to an agent partly depends on the frequency of its use and partly on its intrinsic properties. Anaphylaxis to penicillin or cephalosporins occurs only after it binds to proteins inside the body with some agents binding more easily than others. Anaphylaxis to penicillin occurs once in every 2,000 to 10,000 courses of treatment, with death occurring in fewer than one in every 50,000 courses of treatment. Anaphylaxis to aspirin and NSAIDs occurs in about one in every 50,000 persons. If someone reacts to penicillin, his or her risk of a reaction to cephalosporins is greater but still less than one in 1,000. The old radiocontrast agents caused reactions in 1% of cases, while the newer, lower osmolar agents cause reactions in 0.04% of cases. Avoidance of cephalosporins in those with penicillin allergy creates a significantly greater patient safety risk than the low probability of anaphylaxis. Tables describing the structural similarities of various \u03b2-lactam antibiotics and risk of cross-reaction are https://.\nVenom.\nVenom from stinging or biting insects such as Hymenoptera (ants, bees, and wasps) or Triatominae (kissing bugs) may cause anaphylaxis in susceptible people. Previous reactions that are anything more than a local reaction around the site of the sting, are a risk factor for future anaphylaxis; however, half of the fatalities have had no previous systemic reaction.\nRisk factors.\nPeople with atopic diseases such as asthma, eczema, or allergic rhinitis are at high risk of anaphylaxis from food, latex, and radiocontrast agents but not from injectable medications or stings. One study in children found that 60% had a history of previous atopic diseases, and of children who die from anaphylaxis, more than 90% have asthma. Those with mastocytosis, mast cell activation syndrome (MCAS) or of a higher socioeconomic status are at increased risk.\nPathophysiology.\nAnaphylaxis is a severe allergic reaction of rapid onset affecting many body systems. It is due to the release of inflammatory mediators and cytokines from mast cells and basophils, typically due to an immunologic reaction but sometimes non-immunologic mechanism.\nInterleukin (IL)\u20134 and IL-13 are cytokines important in the initial generation of antibody and inflammatory cell responses to anaphylaxis.\nImmunologic.\nThe vast majority of anaphylaxis is mediated by allergen-specific immunoglobulin E (IgE). In the immunologic mechanism, immunoglobulin E (IgE) binds to the antigen (the foreign material that provokes the allergic reaction). Antigen-bound IgE then activates Fc\u03b5RI receptors on mast cells and basophils. This leads to the release of inflammatory mediators such as histamine. These mediators subsequently increase the contraction of bronchial smooth muscles, trigger vasodilation, increase the leakage of fluid from blood vessels, and compromise circulatory function. \nRarely, anaphylaxis may be triggered by immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies. It should be noted however that allergen-specific IgG is generally considered to be \"protective\" against allergic reactions (including anaphylaxis) because it competes with IgE for binding to the allergen (i.e., it is a blocking antibody) and its immune complexes (lattices of antigen and antibody, or in this case, allergen and IgG) inhibit IgE signaling. \nNon-immunologic.\nNon-immunologic mechanisms involve substances that directly cause the degranulation of mast cells and basophils without ligating the high-affinity IgE receptor. These include agents such as contrast medium, opioids, temperature (hot or cold), and vibration. Sulfites may cause reactions by both immunologic and non-immunologic mechanisms. This is a form of pseudoallergy and is commonly mediated by MRPRX2, a promiscuous receptor that interacts with many substances (especially drugs) to trigger mast cell degranulation without IgE.\nMixed type.\nA form of anaphylaxis that has both IgE-dependent and non-IgE-dependent features has been observed as a consequence of some chemotherapy and monoclonal antibodies, manifesting alongside cytokine storm-like features. \nDiagnosis.\nAnaphylaxis is diagnosed on the basis of a person's signs and symptoms. When any one of the following three occurs within minutes or hours of exposure to an allergen there is a high likelihood of anaphylaxis:\nSkin involvement may include: hives, itchiness, or a swollen tongue, among others. Respiratory difficulties may include: shortness of breath, stridor, or low oxygen levels, among others. Low blood pressure is defined as a greater than 30% decrease from a person's usual blood pressure. In adults, a systolic blood pressure of less than 90 mmHg is often used.\nDuring an attack, blood tests for tryptase or histamine (released from mast cells) might be useful in diagnosing anaphylaxis due to insect stings or medications. However these tests are of limited use if the cause is food or if the person has a normal blood pressure, and they are not specific for the diagnosis. Notably, hereditary alpha tryptasemia is an autosomal dominant condition present in about 5.7% of the population, a condition that is generally asymptomatic (but may increase the frequency and intensity of allergic reactions) that causes elevated levels of tryptase at baseline, which means that in some people, a tryptase may be elevated independent of anaphylaxis. To ensure that an elevated tryptase is not the result of hereditary alpha tryptasemia, the EAACI recommends repeating a tryptase level 24 hours after resolution of anaphylaxis. Additionally, a normal tryptase does not rule out anaphylaxis.\nClassification.\nThere are three main classifications of anaphylaxis.\nAllergy skin testing.\nAllergy testing may help in determining the trigger. Skin allergy testing is available for certain foods and venoms. Blood testing for specific IgE can be useful to confirm milk, egg, peanut, tree nut, and fish allergies.\nSkin testing is available to confirm penicillin allergies, but is not available for other medications. Non-immune forms of anaphylaxis can only be determined by history or exposure to the allergen in question, and not by skin or blood testing.\nDifferential diagnosis.\nIt can sometimes be difficult to distinguish anaphylaxis from asthma, syncope, and panic attacks. Asthma however typically does not entail itching or gastrointestinal symptoms, syncope presents with pallor rather than a rash, and a panic attack may have flushing but does not have hives. Other conditions that may present similarly include: scrombroidosis and anisakiasis.\nPost-mortem findings.\nIn a person who died from anaphylaxis, autopsy may show an \"empty heart\" attributed to reduced venous return from vasodilation and redistribution of intravascular volume from the central to the peripheral compartment. Other signs are laryngeal edema, eosinophilia in lungs, heart and tissues, and evidence of myocardial hypoperfusion. Laboratory findings could detect increased levels of serum tryptase, an increase in total and specific IgE serum levels.\nPrevention.\nAvoidance of the trigger of anaphylaxis is recommended. In cases where this may not be possible, desensitization may be an option. Immunotherapy with Hymenoptera venoms is effective at desensitizing 80\u201390% of adults and 98% of children against allergies to bees, wasps, hornets, yellowjackets, and fire ants. Oral immunotherapy may be effective at desensitizing some people to certain food including milk, eggs, nuts and peanuts; however, adverse effects are common. For example, many people develop an itchy throat, cough, or lip swelling during immunotherapy. Desensitization is also possible for many medications, however it is usually advised that most people simply avoid the agent in question. In those who react to latex it may be important to avoid cross-reactive foods such as avocados, bananas, and potatoes among others.\nPremedications with antihistamines or glucocorticoids does not prevent anaphylaxis, but may be used in specific circumstances, such as rush aeroallergen desensitization or in certain chemotherapy regimens.\nManagement.\nAnaphylaxis is a medical emergency that may require resuscitation measures such as airway management, supplemental oxygen, large volumes of intravenous fluids, and close monitoring. Passive leg raise may also be helpful in the emergency management.\nAdministration of intravenous fluid bolus and epinephrine is the treatment of choice with antihistamines used as adjuncts. A period of in-hospital observation for between 2 and 24 hours is recommended for people once they have returned to normal due to concerns of biphasic anaphylaxis.\nEpinephrine.\nEpinephrine (adrenaline) (1:1000) is the primary treatment for anaphylaxis with no absolute contraindication to its use. It is recommended that an epinephrine solution be given intramuscularly into the mid anterolateral thigh as soon as the diagnosis is suspected. The injection may be repeated every 5 to 15 minutes if there is insufficient response. A second dose is needed in 16\u201335% of episodes with more than two doses rarely required. The intramuscular route is preferred over subcutaneous administration because the latter may have delayed absorption. It is recommended that after diagnosis and treatment of anaphylaxis, the patient should be kept under observation in an appropriate clinical setting until symptoms have fully resolved. Minor adverse effects from epinephrine include tremors, anxiety, headaches, and palpitations. People on \u03b2-blockers may be resistant to the effects of epinephrine, but this is less of an issue with \"cardioselective\" \u03b21-blockers. In this situation, if epinephrine is not effective, intravenous glucagon can be administered, which has a mechanism of action independent of \u03b2-receptors.\nIf necessary, it can also be given intravenously using a dilute epinephrine solution. Intravenous epinephrine, however, has been associated both with dysrhythmia and myocardial infarction. Epinephrine autoinjectors used for self-administration typically come in two doses, one for adults or children who weigh more than 25\u00a0kg and one for children who weigh 10 to 25\u00a0kg.\nMost recently, the FDA has approved an intranasal form of epinephrine under the brand name Neffy, on the basis of its ability to attain levels of epinephrine in people that are believed to be protective against anaphylaxis. There are currently no clinical data on its effectiveness. \nDelayed administration of epinephrine in anaphylaxis is associated with increased rates of hospitalization and mortality.\nAdjuncts.\nAntihistamines (both H1 and H2), while commonly used and assumed effective based on theoretical reasoning, are poorly supported by evidence. A 2007 Cochrane review did not find any good-quality studies upon which to base recommendations and they are not believed to affect airway edema or spasm. Corticosteroids are unlikely to make a difference in the current episode of anaphylaxis, but may be used in the hope of decreasing the risk of biphasic anaphylaxis. Their prophylactic effectiveness in these situations is uncertain. Nebulized salbutamol may be effective for bronchospasm that does not resolve with epinephrine. Methylene blue has been used in those not responsive to other measures due to its presumed effect of relaxing smooth muscle.\nPreparedness.\nPeople prone to anaphylaxis are advised to have an allergy action plan. Parents are advised to inform schools of their children's allergies and what to do in case of an anaphylactic emergency. The action plan usually includes use of epinephrine autoinjectors, the recommendation to wear a medical alert bracelet, and counseling on avoidance of triggers. Immunotherapy is available for certain triggers to prevent future episodes of anaphylaxis. A multi-year course of subcutaneous desensitization has been found effective against stinging insects, while oral desensitization is effective for many foods.\nPrognosis.\nIn those in whom the cause is known and prompt treatment is available, the prognosis is good. Even if the cause is unknown, if appropriate preventive medication is available, the prognosis is generally good. Usually, death occurs due to either respiratory failure (typically involving asphyxia) or cardiovascular complications, such as cardiovascular shock, with 0.7\u201320% of cases causing death. There have been cases of death occurring within minutes. Outcomes in those with exercise-induced anaphylaxis are typically good, with fewer and less severe episodes as people get older.\nEpidemiology.\nThe number of people who get anaphylaxis is 4\u2013100 per 100,000 persons per year, with a lifetime risk of 0.05\u20132%. About 30% of affected people get more than one attack. Exercise-induced anaphylaxis affects about 1 in 2000 young people.\nRates appear to be increasing: the numbers in the 1980s were approximately 20 per 100,000 per year, while in the 1990s, it was 50 per 100,000 per year. The increase appears to be primarily for food-induced anaphylaxis. The risk is greatest in young people and females.\nAnaphylaxis leads to as many as 500\u20131,000 deaths per year (2.7 per million) in the United States, 20 deaths per year in the United Kingdom (0.33 per million), and 15 deaths per year in Australia (0.64 per million). Another estimate from the United States puts the death rate at 0.7 per million. Mortality rates have decreased between the 1970s and 2000s. In Australia, death from food-induced anaphylaxis occur primarily in women while deaths due to insect bites primarily occur in males. Death from anaphylaxis is most commonly triggered by medications.\nHistory.\nThe conditions of anaphylaxis have been known since ancient times. French physician Fran\u00e7ois Magendie had described how rabbits were killed by repeated injections of egg albumin in 1839. However, the phenomenon was discovered by two French physiologists Charles Richet and Paul Portier. In 1901, Albert I, Prince of Monaco requested Richet and Portier join him on a scientific expedition around the French coast of the Atlantic Ocean, specifically to study on the toxin produced by cnidarians (like jellyfish and sea anemones). Richet and Portier boarded Albert's ship \"Princesse Alice II\" for ocean exploration to make collections of the marine animals.\nRichet and Portier extracted a toxin called hypnotoxin from their collection of jellyfish (but the real source was later identified as Portuguese man o' war) and sea anemone (\"Actinia sulcata\"). In their first experiment on the ship, they injected a dog with the toxin in an attempt to immunise the dog, which instead developed a severe reaction (hypersensitivity). In 1902, they repeated the injections in their laboratory and found that dogs normally tolerated the toxin at the first injection, but on re-exposure, three weeks later with the same dose, they always developed fatal shock. They also found that the effect was not related to the doses of toxin used, as even small amounts in secondary injections were lethal. Thus, instead of inducing tolerance (prophylaxis), which they expected, they discovered effects of the toxin as deadly.\nIn 1902, Richet introduced the term \"aphylaxis\" to describe the condition of lack of protection. He later changed the term to \"anaphylaxis\" on the grounds of euphony. The term is from the Greek , , meaning \"against\", and , , meaning \"protection\". On 15 February 1902, Richet and Portier jointly presented their findings before the \"Societ\u00e9 de Biologie\" in Paris. The moment is regarded as the birth of allergy (the term invented by Clemens von Pirquet in 1906) study (allergology). Richet continued to study the phenomenon and was eventually awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his work on anaphylaxis in 1913.\nResearch.\nThere are ongoing efforts to develop sublingual epinephrine to treat anaphylaxis. Trials of sublingual epinephrine, currently called AQST-108 (dipivefrin) and sponsored by Aquestive Therapeutics, are in phase 1 trials as of December 2021.

{"id": "74244", "revid": "28903366", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=74244", "title": "Enrico Mattei", "text": "20th-century Italian politician and businessman\nEnrico Mattei (; 29 April 1906 \u2013 27 October 1962) was an Italian public administrator. After World War II, he was given the task of dismantling the Italian petroleum agency Agip, a state enterprise established by Fascist Italy. Instead, Mattei enlarged and reorganized it into the National Fuel Trust (, ENI). Under his direction, ENI negotiated important oil concessions in the Middle East as well as a significant trade agreement with the Soviet Union, which helped break the oligopoly of the \"Seven Sisters\" that dominated the mid-20th-century oil industry. He also introduced the principle whereby the country that owned exploited oil reserves received 75% of the profits.\nMattei, who became a powerful figure in Italy, was a member of Christian Democracy and of the Italian Parliament from 1948 to 1953. Mattei made ENI a powerful company, so much so that Italians called it \"the state within the state\". He died in a plane crash in 1962, likely caused by a bomb in the plane, although it has never been established which group might have been responsible for his death. The unsolved death of Mattei was the subject of an award-winning film \"The Mattei Affair\" by Francesco Rosi in 1972, with Mattei portrayed by Gian Maria Volont\u00e9. Along with Vittorio Valletta of Fiat S.p.A., he is regarded among the best Italian managers of the 20th century.\nEarly life.\nEnrico Mattei was born in Acqualagna, in the province of Pesaro and Urbino, Marche, as the second of five children of Antonio Mattei (a \"carabiniere\" \u2013 a member of the Italian national gendarmerie) and Angela Galvani. In 1923, he became an apprentice in the tannery industry in Matelica. His career was rapid; from factory hand, he quickly moved on to become a chemical assistant and then to laboratory chief at the age of 21. After his military service, he became the tannery owner's chief assistant. However, the economic crisis at the end of the 1920s made business go from bad to worse until the tannery closed.\nMattei moved to Milan where he worked as a sales representative for foreign companies in tanning dyes and solvents. In 1931, he became a member of the National Fascist Party () created by Benito Mussolini but was not active in politics. Subsequently, he set up a factory producing oil-based emulsifiers for the tanning and textile industries with his brother and sister. In 1934, he founded Industria Chimica Lombarda and two years later, in 1936, he married Greta Paulas, in Vienna. After acquiring an accountancy qualification, he enrolled at Universit\u00e0 Cattolica del Sacro Cuore in Milan.\nIn May 1943, he met the Christian Democracy leader Giuseppe Spataro, who introduced him into anti-Fascist circles in Milan against the Italian fascist regime of Mussolini. After 25 July 1943, when Mussolini was forced to resign, Mattei joined a partisan group of the Italian resistance movement in the mountains around Matelica, supplying them with weapons. He was able to join the resistance, despite suspicion over his former membership of the Fascist party. His role was rather marginal, concentrating mainly on administering and organising activities. After a number of roundups, he escaped to Milan.\nImpressed by his organisational and military skills, Christian Democrats put him in command of their partisan forces. On 26 October 1944, he was captured in Milan, along with others, at the Christian Democrats' secret headquarters in Milan. Detained at the military barracks in Como, he was able to escape on 3 December 1944, taking advantage of a confusion caused by a short circuit which he himself may have engineered. Mattei participated in the North Italian military command of the National Liberation Committee ( \u2013 CLN) on behalf of the Christian Democrats. He was decorated by the United States with the Silver Star.\nAgip and ENI.\nIn 1945, the National Liberation Committee appointed him to the leadership of Agip (\"Azienda Generale Italiana Petrolio\" \u2013 General Italian Oil Company), the national oil company created by the Fascists, with instructions to close it as soon as possible. Mattei instead worked hard to restructure the company and transform it into one of the nation's most important economic assets.\nIn 1949 Mattei made an astonishing public announcement: the soil of the Po Valley in Northern Italy was rich in oil and methane, and Italy would solve all its energy needs using its own resources. Through the Italian press, he then encouraged the idea that the nation (still suffering from the consequences of World War II) would soon become rich. Agip's financial value immediately grew in the stock exchanges, and the company (owned by the state but operating as a private company) became at once solid and important. The reality was a little different; in the territory of Cortemaggiore, in the Valley of Po, a certain amount of methane had been found together with a small quantity of oil.\nMattei's strategy was to use natural gas to support the development of a national industry in Northern Italy, sustaining the postwar boom known as the Italian economic miracle. The gas was not a mere substitute for imported oil but rather a cheaper and more functional substitute for imported coal which the growing industrial activities relied on. High profits from natural gas sales were ploughed back into exploration, production, the expansion of pipelines, and the acquisition of new customers.\nAgip obtained an exclusive concession for gas and oil exploration within the national territory, and was able to retain the profits. Political views were divided; the leftists supported him, and the conservatives (together with the industrialists) opposed him. At this time, Mattei is alleged to have widely used the unofficial financial resources of Agip for extensive bribery, especially of politicians and journalists. He used to say of political parties: \"I use them like I would use a taxi: I sit in, I pay for the trip, I get out.\" Agip gained control of hundreds of companies in all economic fields in the country. Mattei paid great attention to the press, and Agip soon took possession of several newspapers and two agencies.\nIn 1953, a law created the ENI, \"Ente Nazionale Idrocarburi\", into which Agip was merged. Mattei was initially its president, then also the administrator and the general director. In practice, ENI was Mattei and Mattei was ENI.\nInternational influence.\nWhen it became apparent that the domestic resource base would not be sufficient to meet Italy's growing energy demand, Mattei recognized the need to secure foreign supplies. Driven by his ambition to make ENI a player on par with the Exxons and Totals of the world, Mattei expanded abroad and turned his attention to the international oil markets. He invented, or at least used to tell very often, the story of the little cat: \"A little cat arrives where a few big dogs are eating in a pot. The dogs attack him and toss him away. We Italians are like that little cat: in that pot, there is oil for everybody, but someone does not want to let us get close to it.\"\nThis kind of fable made Mattei extremely popular in the economically poor Italy of the time, and he gained the popular support that was needed to gain political support. To break the oligopoly of the \"Seven Sisters\", a term he coined to refer to the dominant oil companies of the mid-20th century, Mattei initiated agreements with the poorest countries of the Middle East and countries of the former Eastern Bloc as well. Mattei visited Moscow in 1959, where he brokered an oil import deal with the Soviet Union in the middle of the Cold War over intense protests from NATO and the United States. He also publicly supported independence movements against colonial powers, which allowed ENI to take advantage of postcolonial bitterness in places like Algeria. To opponents who charged that he was helping Communists and making Italy dependent on a capricious flow from the Soviet Union, Mattei answered that he bought from the cheapest sources.\nMattei forged agreements with Tunisia and Morocco, to which he offered a 50\u201350 partnership for extracting their oil, very different from the sort of concessions normally offered by the major oil companies. To Iran and Egypt, he additionally offered that the risk involved in prospecting was entirely ENI's: if there was no petrol, the countries would not have to pay one cent. In 1957, with ENI already competing with giants like Esso or Shell, rumour has it that Mattei was secretly financing the independence movement against colonialist France in the Algerian War.\nIn 1960, after concluding the agreement with the Soviet Union and while negotiating with China, Mattei publicly declared that the American monopoly was over. The reaction was initially mild, and he was invited to take part in the partition of the prospecting map in the Sahara. Mattei made the independence of Algeria a condition of his acceptance, and no agreement would be subscribed until that event. As a consequence of his stance, Mattei was considered to have become a target of the French far-right terrorist organization \"Organisation arm\u00e9e secr\u00e8te\" (OAS), opposed to Algeria's independence, which began sending him explicit threats.\nDeath.\nOn a 27 October 1962 flight from Catania, Sicily, to the Milan Linate Airport, Mattei's jetplane, a Morane-Saulnier MS.760 Paris, crashed in the surroundings of the small village of Bascap\u00e8 in Lombardy. The cause of the accident has been a mystery. There are strong indications that the crash was caused by a bomb hidden in the aeroplane. All three men on board were killed: Mattei, his pilot Irnerio Bertuzzi, and the American Time\u2013Life journalist William McHale. The inquiries officially declared that it was an accident. The Italian Minister of Defense, Giulio Andreotti, was responsible for the accident investigation.\nDuring his controversial tenure at ENI, Mattei had made many enemies. The U.S. National Security Council described him as an irritation and an obstacle in a classified report from 1958. The French could not forgive him for doing business with the pro-independence movement in Algeria. Responsibility for his death has been attributed to the CIA, to the French OAS, and to the Sicilian Mafia.\nAccording to a 2001 TV documentary by Bernhard Pletschinger and Claus Bredenbrock, evidence was immediately destroyed at the crash site. Flight instruments were put into acid. On 25 October 1995, the Italian public service broadcaster RAI reported the exhumation of the human remains of Mattei and Bertuzzi. Metal debris deformed by an explosion was found in the bones. There is speculation that the fuse of an explosive device was triggered by the mechanism of the landing gear. In 1994, the investigations were reopened. In 1997, a metal indicator and a ring were further analyzed by Donato Firrao of the Polytechnic University of Turin and explosion tracks were found. Based on this evidence, the episode was reclassified by the judge as a homicide but with one or more perpetrators unknown.\nNot trusting the Armed Forces Information Service (\"Servizio informazioni forze armate\", SIFAR), Italy's secret service, even though it was full of his loyal supporters, Mattei constituted a sort of personal security guard made of former partisans, ENI staff by whom he felt protected.\nTheories about his death.\nAccording to Phillipe Thyraud de Vosjoli, a former agent of the French secret service SDECE, SDECE agents were responsible for the 1962 plane crash which took the life of Mattei. Mattei was on the verge of engineering an Italian takeover of French oil interests in Algeria. A French agent code-named Laurent sabotaged Mattei's aircraft.\nWhen preparing the film \"The Mattei Affair\" in 1970, Francesco Rosi asked the journalist Mauro De Mauro to investigate the last days of Mattei in Sicily. De Mauro soon obtained an audio-tape of his last speech and spent days studying it. De Mauro disappeared eight days after he retrieved the tape on 16 September 1970 without leaving a trace. His body was never found. All the Carabinieri and police investigators who searched for De Mauro, and consequently investigated his presumed kidnapping, were later killed. Among them, the general Carlo Alberto Dalla Chiesa and Boris Giuliano were both killed by the Mafia.\nTommaso Buscetta, an important Mafia turncoat (\"pentito\"), declared that the Sicilian Mafia had been involved in the murder of Mattei. According to Buscetta, Mattei was killed at the request of Angelo Bruno of the American Mafia because his policies had damaged important American interests in the Middle East. Journalist De Mauro was subsequently killed in 1970 because his investigation of Mattei's death was getting close to the truth. Gaetano Iann\u00ec, another \"pentito\", declared that a special agreement had been achieved between the Sicilian Mafia and some foreigners for the elimination of Mattei, which was organized by Giuseppe Di Cristina. These statements triggered new inquiries, including the exhumation of Mattei's corpse.\nAdmiral Fulvio Martini, later chief of SISMI (Italy's military secret service), declared that Mattei's plane had been shot down. In 1986, former Italian Prime Minister Amintore Fanfani described the accident as a shooting, perhaps the first act of terrorism in Italy.\nLegacy.\nMattei is a controversial figure in Italian 20th-century history. Mattei made ENI a powerful company, so much so that Italians dub it \"the state within the state\". Some describe him as a sort of paladin, a nationalist, while others point to his hunger for power, and his cold calculating nature.\nMattei coined the term \"Seven Sisters\" (\"sette sorelle\") to refer to the dominant oil companies of the mid-20th century. In 2000, the Trans-Mediterranean Pipeline, a natural gas pipeline from Algeria via Tunisia to Sicily and thence to mainland Italy, was named after Mattei. ENI named a research institute after Mattei. The Fondazione Eni Enrico Mattei (FEEM) is a nonprofit, nonpartisan research institution devoted to the study of sustainable development and global governance. FEEM's mission is to improve the quality of decision-making in public and private spheres.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Joan was a daughter of Charles II of Navarre and Joan of France. She served as regent of Brittany from 1399 until 1403 during the minority of her eldest son, Duke John V. She also served as regent of England during the absence of her stepson King Henry V in 1415. Four years later Henry V imprisoned her and confiscated her money and land. Joan was released in 1422, shortly before Henry's death.\nDuchess of Brittany.\nOn 2 October 1386, Joan married her first husband, Duke John IV of Brittany (known in traditional English sources as John V). She was his third wife and the only one with whom he had children.\nJohn IV died on 1 November 1399 and was succeeded by his and Joan's son, John V. Her son being still a minor, she was made his guardian and the regent of Brittany during his minority. Not long after, King Henry IV of England proposed to marry her. The marriage proposal was given out of mutual personal preference rather than a dynastic marriage. According to the \"Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica\", affection developed between Joan and Henry while he resided at the Breton court during his banishment from England. Joan gave a favourable reply to the proposal, but stated that she could not go through with it until she had set the affairs of Brittany in order and arranged for the security of the duchy and her children.\nJoan knew that it would not be possible for her to continue as regent of Brittany after having married the king of England, nor would she be able to take her sons with her to England. A papal dispensation was necessary for the marriage, which was obtained in 1402. She negotiated with the duke of Burgundy to make him guardian of her sons and regent of Brittany. Finally, she surrendered the custody of her sons and her power as regent of Brittany to the duke of Burgundy, who swore to respect the Breton rights and law, and departed for England with her daughters.\nQueen of England.\nOn 7 February 1403, Joan married Henry IV at Winchester Cathedral. On the 26th, she held her formal entry to London, where she was crowned queen of England.\nQueen Joan was described as beautiful, gracious and majestic, but also as greedy and stingy, and was accused of accepting bribes. Reportedly, she did not have a good impression of England, as a Breton ship was attacked outside the English coast just after her wedding. She preferred the company of her Breton entourage, which caused offence to such a degree that her Breton courtiers were exiled by order of Parliament, a ban the king did not think he could oppose given his sensitive relation to the Parliament at the time.\nJoan and Henry had no surviving children, but it appears that in 1403 Joan gave birth to stillborn twins. She is recorded as having had a good relationship with Henry's children from his first marriage, often taking the side of the future Henry V in his quarrels with his father. Her daughters returned to Brittany three years after their arrival on the order of their brother, her son.\nQueen dowager.\nIn 1413, her second spouse died, succeeded by her stepson Henry V. Joan had a very good relationship with Henry, who allowed her use of his royal castles of Windsor, Wallingford, Berkhamsted and Hertford during his absence in France in 1415. Upon his return, however, he brought her son Arthur of Brittany with him as a prisoner. Joan unsuccessfully tried to have him released. This apparently damaged her relationship with Henry.\nIn August 1419 the goods of her personal confessor, Friar Randolph, were confiscated, although the itemised list shows the objects actually belonged to Joan. The following month, Randolph came before Parliament and claimed that Joan had \"plotted and schemed for the death and destruction of our said lord the King in the most evil and terrible manner imaginable\". Her large fortune was confiscated and she was imprisoned at Pevensey Castle in Sussex and later at Leeds Castle in Kent. She was released upon the order of Henry V in 1422, six weeks before he died.\nAfter her release, her fortune was returned to her, and she lived the rest of her life quietly and comfortably with her own court at Nottingham Castle, through Henry V's reign and into that of his son, Henry VI. She died at Havering-atte-Bower in Essex and was buried in Canterbury Cathedral next to Henry IV.\nJohn Foxholes, of Cheryton, in Hampshire is described as her \"receiver general\" in 1433. \nIssue.\nHer first marriage to Duke John IV of Brittany produced 9 children:\nHer second marriage to King Henry IV of England produced two infants who did not survive:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He was the son and successor of Ordo\u00f1o I. After his death, the Kingdom of Asturias was split between his sons, with Garc\u00eda inheriting Le\u00f3n, Ordo\u00f1o inheriting Galicia, and Fruela inheriting Asturias.\nIn later sources, he is the earliest to be called \"Emperor of Spain.\" He was also titled \"Prince of all Galicia\" (\"Princeps totius Galletiae\").\nLife.\nAlfonso's reign was notable for his comparative success in consolidating the kingdom during the weakness of the Umayyad princes of C\u00f3rdoba. He fought against and gained numerous victories over the Muslims of al-Andalus.\nDuring the first year of his reign, he had to contend with a usurper, Count Fruela of Galicia. He was forced to flee to Castile, but after a few months Fruela was assassinated and Alfonso returned to Oviedo.\nHe defeated a Basque rebellion in 867 and, much later, a Galician one as well. He conquered Porto and Coimbra in 867 and 879 respectively. In about 869, he formed an alliance with the Kingdom of Pamplona, and solidified this link by marrying Jimena, who is thought to have been the daughter of king Garc\u00eda \u00cd\u00f1iguez, or less likely, a member of the Jim\u00e9nez dynasty, and also married his sister Leodegundia to a prince of Pamplona.\nIn the Reconquista.\nThe following year, 867, Alfonso had to attend to an uprising in the eastern part of the kingdom, in Alava, according to the Chronicle of Albeda. According to the Chronicle of Sampiro, the revolt was led by Count Eylo. Sampiro describes these events as follows:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;A messenger arrived from \u00c1lava, announcing that their hearts had inflated against the king: hearing that, the monarch decided to march there. Driven by the fear of their arrival, they quickly recognized their obligations and supplicants, lowered their heads before him and promised that they would remain faithful to his kingdom and authority, and that they would do what was commanded. In this way he submitted to his power an Alava lying before him, and Eylo, who presented himself as his count, brought him to Oviedo loaded with iron.\nHis father, Ordo\u00f1o, had begun the resettlement of the border territories and Alfonso continued with it. His first successes were in Portuguese lands, where King Alfonso's troops succeeded in locating the southwestern frontier on the Mondego river. Count Vimara Perez in 868 conquered Porto and resettled the district. In 878, the army of King Alfonso III, with Count Hermenegildo Guti\u00e9rrez in command, faced the Muslim forces led by the emir of Cordoba, Mohammad I, who had started an attack against Porto. After defeating the emir's forces and expelling the Muslim inhabitants of Coimbra and Oporto, Guti\u00e9rrez' Christian troops occupied and repopulated other cities, such as Braga, Viseo and Lamego, with men taken from Galicia. Coimbra, Lamego and Viseo were conquered again after 987 by Almanzor and it was not until 1064 when Coimbra was finally reconquered by King Ferdinand I of Le\u00f3n.\nAlfonso III had to face the offensive of the Umayyad prince al-Mundir, son of Mohamed I. Fighting occurred almost constantly between 875 and 883. The first Umayyad raids were aimed at Le\u00f3n and El Bierzo, but failed. The Christian counteroffensive ended with the taking of Deza and Atienza.\nAbd al-Rahman ibn Marwan, the Galician, Lord of M\u00e9rida and rebel against the Emir of C\u00f3rdoba, sent his minister, Hashim ibn Abd al-Aziz , to appease the Emir. Thus in 878, Al-Mundir directed his armies back to Leon and Astorga, while Salid ben Ganim reached the \u00d3rbigo. Alfonso, hoping to prevent the union of both armies, went out to meet the latter, whose forces he defeated in the battle of Polvoraria, at the confluence of the \u00d3rbigo and Esla rivers. Al-Mundir then withdrew, but Alfonso III intercepted him in the valley of Valdemora and was victorious. Mohamed was forced to pay the ransom and sign a three-year truce, the first time that C\u00f3rdoba had asked for peace.\nBoth kings considered the truce as a pause while preparing for the next assault: Mohamed raised a fleet to attack Galicia, but it was destroyed by a storm. Alfonso and Ibn Marwan descended through the Tagus Valley and defeated the Cordovan army on Mount Oxifer, next to the Guadiana River.\nAs revenge, Mohamed attacked the kingdom of Zaragoza in 882, where Alfonso had sent his son Ordo\u00f1o to be educated with the Banu Qasi, sons of Musa, advancing through the ancient Roman road to Leon. There was an exchange of prisoners and the Cordovans withdrew. They repeated the campaign in 883 with the same result. In 884 Mohamed I and Alfonso III signed a peace, since both began to have serious internal problems. The great king was met with a rising led by his brothers Fruela, Odoario and Bermudo, who became strong in Astorga, supported by several counts, but were quickly defeated and executed. In 901 the Umayyad rebel Ibn al-Qitt proclaimed Mahdi, preached holy war and attacked Zamora - \"rebuilt and repopulated by Mozarabic Toledo [...] the most important advanced square of the Asturian kingdom\" - which he was able to resist. The messianic leader, abandoned by his own, was defeated and killed in battle on what is known as the Day of Zamora. In those years, the emirate of Cordoba, wracked by civil disorder, stopped disturbing the kingdom of Asturias. Alonso faced off against his former allies in M\u00e9rida and the Ebro valley: allied with the Count of Pallars, he instigated a coup that managed to defeat the Banu Qasi and install a Navarrese, Sancho Garc\u00e9s I, on the throne of Pamplona.\nHe ordered the writing of three chronicles which held the theory that the kingdom of Asturias was the rightful successor of the old Visigothic kingdom. Alfonso was also a patron of the arts, like his grandfather before him. He built the church of Santo Adriano. According to a letter of disputed authenticity dated to 906, the \"Epistola Adefonsi Hispaniae regis\", Alfonso arranged to purchase an \"imperial crown\" from the cathedral of Tours.\nIn 909, Alfonso moved the seat of his government to Oviedo. According to Sampiro, his sons (Garc\u00eda, Ordo\u00f1o, Gonzalo, Fruela and Ramiro) conspired against him, under the influence of Garc\u00eda's father-in-law. Alfonso had Garc\u00eda imprisoned but the conspirators were able to free him and he fled to Boiges. However, Alfonso later convinced Garc\u00eda to join him in a campaign against the Moors. Alfonso died in Zamora of natural causes in 910, having reigned for 44 years. Ibn Hayyan likewise tells of an uprising, but says that Alfonso himself was imprisoned. Following his death, the kingdom was divided among his sons: his eldest son, Garc\u00eda, became king of Le\u00f3n; the second son, Ordo\u00f1o, reigned in Galicia; and Fruela received Asturias with Oviedo as his capital. These lands would be reunited when Garc\u00eda died childless and Le\u00f3n passed to Ordo\u00f1o, while on Ordo\u00f1o's death the lands were reunited under Fruela. However, Fruela's death the next year started a series of internal struggles that led to unstable succession for over a century.\n* The Albeldense Chronicle (c.\u2009881).\n* The prophetic Chronicle (c.\u2009883).\n* The Chronicle of the Visigoth Kings or Chronicle of Alfonso III (c.\u2009911).\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

In North America, the game was released by Midway Manufacturing as part of its licensing agreement with Namco America. The player controls Pac-Man, who must eat all the dots inside an enclosed maze while avoiding four colored ghosts. Eating large flashing dots called \"Power Pellets\" causes the ghosts to temporarily turn blue, allowing Pac-Man to eat the ghosts for bonus points.\nGame development began in early 1979, led by Toru Iwatani with a nine-man team. Iwatani wanted to create a game that could appeal to women as well as men, because most video games of the time had themes that appealed to traditionally masculine interests, such as war or sports. Although the inspiration for the Pac-Man character was the image of a pizza with a slice removed, Iwatani has said he rounded out the Japanese character for mouth, kuchi (). The in-game characters were made to be cute and colorful to appeal to younger players. The original Japanese title of \"Puck Man\" was derived from the Japanese phrase \"paku paku taberu\", which refers to gobbling something up; the title was changed to \"Pac-Man\" for the North American release due to fears of vandals defacing cabinets by converting the \"P\" into an \"F\", as in \"fuck\".\n\"Pac-Man\" was a widespread critical and commercial success, leading to several sequels, merchandise, and two television series, as well as a hit single, \"Pac-Man Fever\", by Buckner &amp; Garcia. The character of Pac-Man has become the official mascot of Namco and later Bandai Namco Entertainment. The game remains one of the highest-grossing and best-selling games, generating more than $14\u00a0billion in revenue (as of 2016[ [update]]) and 43\u00a0million units in sales combined, and has an enduring commercial and cultural legacy, commonly listed as one of the greatest video games of all time.\nGameplay.\n\"Pac-Man\" is an action maze chase video game; the player controls the eponymous character through an enclosed maze. The objective of the game is to eat all of the dots placed in the maze while avoiding four colored ghosts\u2014Blinky (red), Pinky (pink), Inky (cyan), and Clyde (orange)\u2014who pursue Pac-Man. When Pac-Man eats all of the dots, the player advances to the next level. Levels are indicated by fruit icons at the bottom of the screen. In between levels are short cutscenes featuring Pac-Man and Blinky in humorous, comical situations.\nIf Pac-Man is caught by a ghost, he loses a life; the game ends when all lives are lost. Each of the four ghosts has its own unique artificial intelligence (A.I.), or \"personality\": Blinky gives direct chase to Pac-Man; Pinky and Inky try to position themselves in front of Pac-Man, usually by cornering him; and Clyde switches between chasing and fleeing from Pac-Man depending on his distance from him.\nPlaced near the four corners of the maze are large flashing \"energizers\" or \"power pellets\". When Pac-Man eats one, the ghosts turn blue with a dizzied expression and reverse direction. Pac-Man can eat blue ghosts for bonus points; when a ghost is eaten, its eyes make their way back to the center box in the maze, where the ghost \"regenerates\" and resumes its normal activity. Eating multiple blue ghosts in succession increases their point value. After a certain amount of time, blue-colored ghosts flash white before turning back into their normal forms. Eating a certain number of dots in a level causes a bonus item\u2014usually a fruit\u2014to appear underneath the center box; the item can be eaten for bonus points. To the sides of the maze are two \"warp tunnels\", which allow Pac-Man and the ghosts to travel to the opposite side of the screen. Ghosts become slower when entering and exiting these tunnels.\nThe game increases in difficulty as the player progresses: the ghosts become faster, and the energizers' effect decreases in duration, eventually disappearing entirely. An integer overflow causes the 256th level to load improperly, rendering it impossible to complete. This is known as a kill screen.\nDevelopment.\nAfter acquiring the struggling Japanese division of Atari in 1974, video game developer Namco began producing its own video games in-house, as opposed to licensing them from other developers and distributing them in Japan. Company president Masaya Nakamura created a small video game development group within the company and ordered them to study several NEC-produced microcomputers to potentially create games with. One of the first people assigned to this division was a 24-year-old employee named Toru Iwatani. He created Namco's first video game \"Gee Bee\" in 1978, which while unsuccessful helped the company gain a stronger foothold in the quickly growing video game industry. He assisted in the production of two sequels, \"Bomb Bee\" and \"Cutie Q\", both released in 1979.\nThe Japanese video game industry had surged in popularity with games such as \"Space Invaders\" and \"Breakout\", which led to the market being flooded with similar titles from other manufacturers in an attempt to cash in on the success. Iwatani felt that arcade games only appealed to men for their crude graphics and violence, and that arcades in general were seen as seedy environments. For his next project, Iwatani chose to create a non-violent, cheerful video game that appealed mostly to women, as he believed that attracting women and couples into arcades would potentially make them appear to be much more family-friendly in tone. Iwatani began thinking of things that women liked to do in their time; he decided to center his game around eating, basing this on women liking to eat desserts and other sweets. His game was initially called \"Pakkuman\", based on the Japanese onomatopoeia term \"paku paku taberu\", referencing the mouth movement of opening and closing in succession.\nThe game that later became \"Pac-Man\" began development in early 1979 and took a year and five months to complete, the longest for a video game up to that point. Iwatani enlisted the help of nine other Namco employees to assist in production, including composer Toshio Kai, programmer Shigeo Funaki, and hardware engineer Shigeichi Ishimura. Care was taken to make the game appeal to a \"non-violent\" audience, particularly women, with its usage of simple gameplay and cute, attractive character designs. When the game was being developed, Namco was underway with designing \"Galaxian\", which used a then-revolutionary RGB color display, allowing sprites to use several colors at once instead of using colored strips of cellophane that was commonplace at the time; this technological accomplishment allowed Iwatani to greatly enhance his game with bright pastel colors, which he felt would help attract players. The idea for energizers was a concept Iwatani borrowed from Popeye the Sailor, a cartoon character that temporarily acquires superhuman strength after eating a can of spinach; it is believed that Iwatani was partly inspired by a Japanese children's story about a creature that protected children from monsters by devouring them. Frank Fogleman, the co-founder of Gremlin Industries, believes that the maze-chase gameplay of \"Pac-Man\" was inspired by Sega's \"Head On\" (1979), a similar arcade game that was popular in Japan.\nIwatani has often claimed that the character of Pac-Man was designed after the shape of a pizza with a missing slice while he was at lunch; in a 1986 interview he said that this was only half-true, and that the Pac-Man character was also based on him rounding out and simplifying the Japanese character \"kuchi\" (\u53e3), meaning \"mouth\". The four ghosts were made to be cute, colorful and appealing, using bright, pastel colors and expressive blue eyes. Iwatani had used this idea before in \"Cutie Q\", which features similar ghost-like characters, and decided to incorporate it into \"Pac-Man\". He was inspired by the television series \"Casper the Friendly Ghost\" and the manga \"Obake no Q-Taro\". Ghosts were chosen as the game's main antagonists because they were used as villainous characters in animation. The idea for the fruit bonuses was based on graphics displayed on slot machines, which often use symbols such as cherries and bells.\nOriginally, Namco president Masaya Nakamura had requested that all of the ghosts be red and thus indistinguishable from one another. Iwatani believed that the ghosts should be different colors, and he received unanimous support from his colleagues for this idea. The ghosts were programmed to have their own distinct personalities, so as to keep the game from becoming too boring or impossibly difficult to play. Each ghost's name gives a hint to its strategy for tracking down Pac-Man: Shadow (\"Blinky\") always chases Pac-Man, Speedy (\"Pinky\") tries to get ahead of him, Bashful (\"Inky\") uses a more complicated strategy to zero in on him, and Pokey (\"Clyde\") alternates between chasing him and running away. (The ghosts' Japanese names are \u304a\u3044\u304b\u3051, \"chase\"; \u307e\u3061\u3076\u305b, \"ambush\"; \u304d\u307e\u3050\u308c, \"fickle\"; and \u304a\u3068\u307c\u3051, \"playing dumb\", respectively.) To break up the tension of constantly being pursued, humorous intermissions between Pac-Man and Blinky were added. The sound effects were among the last things added to the game, created by Toshio Kai. In a design session, Iwatani noisily ate fruit and made gurgling noises to describe to Kai how he wanted the eating effect to sound. Upon completion, the game was titled \"Puck Man\", based on the working title.\nRelease.\nLocation testing for \"Puck Man\" began on May 22, 1980, in Shibuya, Tokyo. Non-gamers responded well to it, finding it easy to learn, while arcade regulars were not impressed. A private showing for the game was done in June, followed by a nationwide release in July. Eyeing the game's success in Japan, Namco initialized plans to bring the game to the international market, particularly the United States. Before showing the game to distributors, Namco America made a number of changes, such as altering the names of the ghosts. Another was the game's title, as executives at Namco were worried that vandals would change the \"P\" in \"Puck Man\" to an \"F\". Masaya Nakamura chose to rename it to \"Pac-Man\", as he felt it was closer to the game's original Japanese title of \"Pakkuman\". In Europe, the game was released under both titles. After \"Puck Man\" was ruled out but before \"Pac-Man\" was decided upon, early American promotional material used the name \"Snapper\".\nWhen Namco presented \"Pac-Man\" and \"Rally-X\" to potential distributors at the 1980 AMOA tradeshow in November, executives believed that \"Rally-X\" would be the best-selling game of that year. According to \"Play Meter\" magazine, both \"Pac-Man\" and \"Rally-X\" received mild attention at the show. Namco had initially approached Atari to distribute \"Pac-Man\", but Atari refused the offer. Midway Manufacturing subsequently agreed to distribute both \"Pac-Man\" and \"Rally-X\" in North America, announcing their acquisition of the manufacturing rights on November 22 and releasing them in December.\nPorts.\n\"Pac-Man\" was ported to several home video game systems and personal computers; the most infamous of these is the 1982 Atari 2600 conversion, designed by Tod Frye and published by Atari, Inc. This version of the game was widely criticized for its inaccurate portrayal of the arcade version and for its peculiar design choices, most notably the flickering effect of the ghosts. However, it was a commercial success, selling over seven million copies. Atari released versions for the Intellivision, VIC-20, Commodore 64, Apple II, IBM PC compatibles, TI-99/4A, ZX Spectrum, and the Atari 8-bit computers. A port for the Atari 5200 was released in 1983, a version that is considered as a significant improvement over the Atari 2600 version.\nNamco released a version for the Nintendo Famicom in 1984 as one of the console's first third-party titles, as well as a port for the MSX computer. The Famicom version was later released in North America for the Nintendo Entertainment System by Tengen, a subsidiary of Atari Games. Tengen produced an unlicensed version of the game in a black cartridge shell, released during a time when Tengen and Nintendo were in disagreements over the latter's stance on quality control for its consoles; this version was re-released by Namco as an official title in 1993, featuring a new cartridge label and box. The Famicom version was released for the Famicom Disk System in 1990 as a budget title for the Disk Writer kiosks in retail stores. The same year, Namco released a port of \"Pac-Man\" for the Game Boy, which allowed for two-player co-operative play via the Game Link Cable peripheral. A version for the Game Gear was released a year later, which likewise enabled support for multiplayer. In celebration of the game's 20th anniversary in 1999, Namco re-released the Game Boy version for the Game Boy Color, bundled with \"Pac-Attack\" and titled \"Pac-Man: Special Color Edition\". The same year, Namco and SNK co-published a port for the Neo Geo Pocket Color, which came with a circular \"Cross Ring\" that attached to the d-pad to restrict it to four-directional movement.\nIn 2001, Namco released a port of \"Pac-Man\" for various Japanese mobile phones, being one of the company's first mobile game releases. The Famicom version of the game was re-released for the Game Boy Advance in 2004 as part of the \"Famicom Mini\" series, released to commemorate the 25th anniversary of the Famicom; this version was released in North America and Europe under the \"Classic NES Series\" label. Namco Networks released \"Pac-Man\" for BREW mobile devices in 2005. The arcade original was released for the Xbox Live Arcade service in 2006, featuring achievements and online leaderboards. In 2009 a version for iOS devices was published; this release was rebranded as \"Pac-Man + Tournaments\" in 2013, featuring new mazes and leaderboards. The NES version was released for the Wii Virtual Console in 2007. A Roku version was released in 2011, alongside a port of the Game Boy release for the 3DS Virtual Console. \"Pac-Man\" was one of four titles released under the \"Arcade Game Series\" brand, which was published for the Xbox One, PlayStation 4 and PC in 2016. In 2021, according to Nintendo Direct, it was announced that Hamster Corporation would release \"Pac-Man\", along with \"Xevious\", for the Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 4 as part of its \"Arcade Archives\" series, marking the first two Namco games to be included as part of the series.\n\"Pac-Man\" is included in many Namco compilations, including \"Namco Museum Vol. 1\" (1995), \"Namco Museum 64\" (1999), \"Namco Museum Battle Collection\" (2005), \"Namco Museum DS\" (2007), \"Namco Museum Essentials\" (2009), and \"Namco Museum Megamix\" (2010). In 1996, it was re-released for arcades as part of \"Namco Classic Collection Vol. 2\", alongside \"Dig Dug\", \"Rally-X\" and special \"Arrangement\" remakes of all three titles. Microsoft included \"Pac-Man\" in \"Microsoft Return of Arcade\" (1995) as a way to help attract video game companies to its Windows 95 operating system. Namco released the game in the third volume of \"Namco History\" in Japan in 1998. The 2001 Game Boy Advance compilation \"Pac-Man Collection\" compiles \"Pac-Man\", \"Pac-Mania\", \"Pac-Attack\" and \"Pac-Man Arrangement\" onto one cartridge. \"Pac-Man\" is a hidden extra in the arcade game \"Ms. Pac-Man/Galaga - Class of 1981\" (2001). A similar cabinet was released in 2005 that featured \"Pac-Man\" as the centerpiece. \"\" (1993) and \"Pac-Man World 2\" (2002) have \"Pac-Man\" as an unlockable extra. Alongside the Xbox 360 remake \"Pac-Man Championship Edition\", it was ported to the Nintendo 3DS in 2012 as part of \"Pac-Man &amp; Galaga Dimensions\". The 2010 Wii game \"Pac-Man Party\" and its 2011 3DS remake include \"Pac-Man\" as a bonus game, alongside the arcade versions of \"Dig Dug\" and \"Galaga\". In 2014, \"Pac-Man\" was included in the compilation title \"Pac-Man Museum\" for the Xbox 360, PlayStation 3 and PC, alongside several other \"Pac-Man\" games. The NES version is one of 30 games included in the NES Classic Edition.\nReception.\nUpon its North American debut at AMOA 1980, the game initially received a mild response. \"Play Meter\" magazine previewed the game and called it \"a cute game which appears to grow on players, something which cute games are not prone to do,\" saying that there's \"more to the game than at first appears\" but criticized the sound as a drawback, saying it is \"good for awhile, then becomes annoying.\" Upon release, the game exceeded expectations with wide critical and commercial success.\nCommercial performance.\nWhen it was first released in Japan, \"Pac-Man\" was initially only a modest success; Namco's own \"Galaxian\" (1979) had quickly outdone the game in popularity because its predominately male player base was familiar with its shooting gameplay as opposed to \"Pac-Man\"'s cute characters and maze-chase theme. \"Pac-Man\" eventually became very successful in Japan, where it went on to be Japan's highest-grossing arcade game of 1980 according to the annual \"Game Machine\" charts, dethroning \"Space Invaders\" (1978) which had topped the annual charts for two years in a row and leading to a shift in the Japanese market away from space shooters towards action games featuring comical characters. \"Pac-Man\" was Japan's fourth highest-grossing arcade game of 1981.\nIn North America, Midway had limited expectations prior to release, initially manufacturing 5,000 units for the US, before it caught on upon release there. Some arcades purchased entire rows of \"Pac-Man\" cabinets. It became a nationwide success. Upon release in 1980, it was earning about $\u00a0million per week in the United States. Within one year, more than 100,000 arcade units had been sold which grossed more than $\u00a0billion in quarters. It overtook Atari's \"Asteroids\" (1979) as the best-selling arcade game in the country, and surpassed the film \"Star Wars\" (1977) with more than $\u00a0billion in revenue. \"Pac-Man\" was the United States' highest-grossing arcade game of 1981, and second highest game of 1982. By 1982, it was estimated to have had 30\u00a0million active players across the United States; \"Pac-Man\" was so compelling that a player in San Francisco reportedly shot someone for interrupting him during play. The game's success was partly driven by its popularity among female audiences, becoming \"the first commercial videogame to involve large numbers of women as players\" according to Midway's Stan Jarocki, with \"Pac-Man\" being the favorite coin-op game among female gamers through 1982. Among the nine arcade games covered by \"How to Win Video Games\" (1982), \"Pac-Man\" was the only one with females accounting for a majority of players.\nThe number of arcade units sold had tripled to 400,000 by 1982, receiving an estimated total of between seven billion coins and $\u00a0billion. In a 1983 interview, Nakamura said that though he did expect \"Pac-Man\" to be successful, \"I never thought it would be this big.\" \"Pac-Man\" is the best-selling arcade game of all time, with total estimated earnings ranging from 10 billion coins and $3.5\u00a0billion ($7.7\u00a0billion adjusted for inflation) to $\u00a0billion ($\u00a0billion adjusted for inflation) in arcades. \"Pac-Man\" and \"Ms. Pac-Man\" also topped the US \"RePlay\" cocktail arcade cabinet charts for 23 months, from February 1982 through 1983 up until February 1984.\nThe Atari 2600 version of the game sold over 8 million copies, making it the console's best-selling title. In addition, Coleco's tabletop mini-arcade unit sold over 1.5 million units in 1982, the \"Pac-Man\" Nelsonic Game Watch sold more than 500,000 units the same year, the Family Computer (Famicom) version and its 2004 Game Boy Advance re-release sold a combined 598,000 copies in Japan, the Atari 5200 version sold cartridges between 1986 and 1988, the Atari 8-bit computer version sold copies in 1986 and 1990, Thunder Mountain's 1986 budget release for home computers received a Diamond certification from the Software Publishers Association in 1989 for selling over 500,000 copies, and mobile phone ports have sold over 30 million paid downloads as of 2010[ [update]]. \"II Computing\" also listed the Atarisoft port tenth on the magazine's list of top Apple II games as of late 1985, based on sales and market-share data. As of 2016[ [update]], all versions of \"Pac-Man\" are estimated to have grossed a total of more than $\u00a0billion in revenue.\nAccolades.\n\"Pac-Man\" was awarded \"Best Commercial Arcade Game\" at the 1982 Arcade Awards. \"Pac-Man\" also won the Video Software Dealers Association's VSDA Award for Best Videogame. In 2001, \"Pac-Man\" was voted the greatest video game of all time by a Dixons poll in the UK. The \"Killer List of Videogames\" listed \"Pac-Man\" as the most popular game of all time. The list aggregator site Playthatgame currently ranks Pac-Man as the #53rd top game of all-time &amp; game of the year.\nImpact.\n\"Pac-Man\" is considered by many to be one of the most influential video games of all time. The game established the maze chase game genre, was the first video game to make use of power-ups, and the individual ghosts have deterministic artificial intelligence (AI) that reacts to player actions. \"Pac-Man\" is considered one of the first video games to have demonstrated the potential of player characters in the medium; its title character was the first original gaming mascot, it increased the appeal of video games with female audiences, and it was gaming's first broad licensing success. It is often cited as the first game with cutscenes (in the form of brief comical interludes about Pac-Man and Blinky chasing each other), though actually \"Space Invaders Part II\" employed a similar style of between-level intermissions in 1979.\n\"Pac-Man\" was a turning point for the arcade video game industry, which had previously been dominated by space shoot 'em ups since \"Space Invaders\" (1978). \"Pac-Man\" popularized a genre of \"character-led\" action games, leading to a wave of character action games involving player characters in 1981, such as Nintendo's prototypical platform game \"Donkey Kong\", Konami's \"Frogger\" and Universal Entertainment's \"Lady Bug\". \"Pac-Man\" was one of the first popular non-shooting action games, defining key elements of the genre such as \"parallel visual processing\" which requires simultaneously keeping track of multiple entities, including the player's location, the enemies, and the energizers.\nMaze games became popular on home computers after the release of \"Pac-Man\". Some of them appeared before official ports and garnered more attention from consumers, and sometimes lawyers, as a result. These include \"Taxman\" (1981) and \"Snack Attack\" (1982) for the Apple II, \"Jawbreaker\" (1981) for the Atari 8-bit computers, \"Scarfman\" (1981) for the TRS-80, and \"K.C. Munchkin!\" (1981) for the Odyssey\u00b2. Namco produced several other maze games, including \"Rally-X\" (1980), \"Dig Dug\" (1982), \"Exvania\" (1992), and \"Tinkle Pit\" (1994). Atari sued Philips for creating \"K.C. Munchkin\" in the case \"Atari, Inc. v. North American Philips Consumer Electronics Corp.\", leading to \"Munchkin\" being pulled from store shelves under court order. No major competitors emerged to challenge \"Pac-Man\" in the maze subgenre.\n\"Pac-Man\" inspired 3D variants of the concept, such as \"Monster Maze\" (1982), \"Spectre\" (1982), and early first-person shooters such as \"MIDI Maze\" (1987; which had similar character designs). John Romero credited \"Pac-Man\" as the game that had the biggest influence on his career; \"Wolfenstein 3D\" includes a \"Pac-Man\" level from a first-person perspective. Many post-\"Pac-Man\" titles include power-ups that briefly turn the tables on the enemy. The game's artificial intelligence inspired programmers who later worked for companies like Bethesda.\nReviews.\nReviewing home console versions in 1982, \"Games\" magazine called the Atari 5200 implementation a \"splendidly reproduced\" version of the arcade game, noting a difference in maze layouts for the television screen. It considered the Atari 2600 version to have \"much weaker graphics\", but to still be one of the best games for that console. In both cases the reviewer felt that the joystick controls were harder to use than those of the arcade machine, and that \"attempts to make quick turns are often frustrated\".\nLegacy.\nGuinness World Records has awarded the \"Pac-Man\" series eight records in \"Guinness World Records: Gamer's Edition 2008\", including \"Most Successful Coin-Operated Game\". On June 3, 2010, at the NLGD Festival of Games, the game's creator, Toru Iwatani, officially received the certificate from Guinness World Records for \"Pac-Man\" having had the most \"coin-operated arcade machines\" installed worldwide: 293,822. The record was set and recognized in 2005 and mentioned in the \"Guinness World Records: Gamer's Edition 2008\", awarded in 2010. In 2009, \"Guinness World Records\" listed Pac-Man as the most recognizable video game character in the United States, recognized by 94% of the population, above Mario who was recognized by 93% of the population. In 2015, The Strong National Museum of Play inducted \"Pac-Man\" to its World Video Game Hall of Fame. The Pac-Man character and game series became an icon of video game culture during the 1980s.\nThe game has inspired various real-life recreations, involving real people or robots. One event called Pac-Manhattan set a Guinness World Record for \"Largest \"Pac-Man\" Game\" in 2004.\nThe business term \"Pac-Man defense\" in mergers and acquisitions refers to a hostile takeover target that attempts to reverse the situation and instead acquire its attempted acquirer, a reference to \"Pac-Man\"'s energizers. The \"Pac-Man renormalization\" is named for a cosmetic resemblance to the character, in the mathematical study of the Mandelbrot set. The game's popularity has led to \"Pac-Man\" being adopted as a nickname, such as by boxer Manny Pacquiao and the American football player Adam Jones.\nIn 2012, the Pac-Man was inducted into the permanent collection of the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) in New York City. This addition was part of an initial selection (Wave 1) of fourteen video games.\nOn August 21, 2016, in the 2016 Summer Olympics closing ceremony, during a video which showcases Tokyo as the host of the 2020 Summer Olympics, a small segment shows Pac-Man and the ghosts racing and eating dots on a running track.\nMerchandise.\nA wide variety of \"Pac-Man\" merchandise have been marketed with the character's image. By 1982, Midway had about 95-105 licensees selling \"Pac-Man\" merchandise, including major companies, such as AT&amp;T selling a \"Pac-Man\" telephone. There were more than 500 \"Pac-Man\" related products.\n7-Eleven sold \"Pac-Man\" themed merchandise at its stores since the game's initial popularity in the 1980s. This has included collectible Slurpee and Big Gulp cups. In 2023, 7-Eleven included \"Pac-Man\" in its Spring 2023 marketing material including at Speedway and Stripes banner locations, and sold more merchandise around the game as well as rebranding some of its products after the ghosts. This included its house blend coffee (Clyde's Coffee Blend), two Slurpee flavors (Blinky's Cherry &amp; Inky's Blueberry Raz), and a special limited time only cappuccino flavor (Pinky's Strawberry White Chocolate Cappuccino), the latter of which came out pink to match the ghost.\n\"Pac-Man\" themed merchandise sales had exceeded $\u00a0billion in the US by 1982. \"Pac-Man\" related merchandise products included bumper stickers, jewellery, accessories (such as a $20,000 \"Ms. Pac-Man\" choker with 14 karat gold), bicycles, breakfast cereals, popsicles, t-shirts, toys and pasta.\n\"Lego\" released an exclusive set of a \"Pac-Man\" arcade machine for their \"Lego Icons\" line. A \"Lego\" version of Pac-Man, Clyde, and Blinky are featured on the top of the machine, with a minifigure playing a miniature version of the machine.\nTelevision.\nThe \"Pac-Man\" animated television series produced by Hanna\u2013Barbera aired on ABC from 1982 to 1983. It was the highest-rated Saturday morning cartoon show in the US during late 1982.\nA computer-generated animated series produced by Bandai Namco Games, 41 Entertainment, Arad Productions, OLM Digital and Sprite Animation Studios titled \"Pac-Man and the Ghostly Adventures\" aired on Disney XD from June 15, 2013, to May 25, 2015.\nLiterature.\nThe original \"Pac-Man\" game plays a key role in the plot of Ernest Cline's video game-themed science fiction novel \"Ready Player One\".\nMusic.\nThe Buckner &amp; Garcia song \"Pac-Man Fever\" (1981) went to No. 9 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 charts, and received a Gold certification for more than 1\u00a0million records sold by 1982, and a total of 2.5\u00a0million copies sold as of 2008. More than one million copies of the group's \"Pac-Man Fever\" album (1982) were sold.\nIn 1982, \"Weird Al\" Yankovic recorded a parody of \"Taxman\" by the Beatles as \"Pac-Man\". It was eventually released in 2017 as part of \"\". In 1992, Aphex Twin (with the name Power-Pill) released \"Pac-Man\", a techno album which consists mostly of samples from the game.\nThe character appears in the music video for Bloodhound Gang's \"Mope\", released in 2000. Here, the character is portrayed as a cocaine addict.\nOn July 20, 2020, Gorillaz and Schoolboy Q, released a track entitled \"Pac-Man\" as a part of Gorillaz' \"Song Machine\" series to commemorate the game's 40th anniversary, with the music video depicting the band's frontman, 2-D, playing a Gorillaz-themed Pac-Man arcade game.\nFilm.\nThe Pac-Man character appears in the film \"Pixels\" (2015), with Denis Akiyama playing series creator Toru Iwatani. Iwatani makes a cameo at the beginning of the film as an arcade technician. \"Pac-Man\" is referenced and makes an appearance in the 2017 film \"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2\" and the video game, \"Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy\". The game, the character, and the ghosts all appear in the film \"Wreck-It Ralph\", as well as the sequel \"Ralph Breaks the Internet\".\nIn \"\", Kirito and his friends beat a virtual reality game called \"PAC-Man 2026\", which is loosely based on \"Pac-Man 256\". In the Japanese tokusatsu film \"Kamen Rider Heisei Generations: Dr. Pac-Man vs. Ex-Aid &amp; Ghost with Legend Riders\", a Pac-Man-like character is the main villain.\nIn the 2010 film \"Scott Pilgrim vs. the World\", the titular character makes reference to the original Japanese name.\nThe 2018 film \"Relaxer\" uses \"Pac-Man\" as a strong plot element in the story of a 1999 couch-bound man who attempts to beat the game (and encounters the famous Level 256 glitch) before the year 2000 problem occurs.\nVarious attempts for a feature film based on Pac-Man have been planned since the peak of the original game's popularity. Following the release of \"Ms. Pac-Man\", a feature film was being developed, but never reached an agreement. In 2008, a live-action film based on the series was in development at Crystal Sky. In 2022, plans for a live-action \"Pac-Man\" film were revived at Wayfarer Studios, based on an idea by Chuck Williams.\nOther gaming media.\nIn 1982, Milton Bradley Company released a board game based on \"Pac-Man\". Players move up to four Pac-Man characters (traditional yellow plus red, green, and blue) plus two ghosts as per the throws of a pair of dice. The two ghost pieces were randomly packed with one of four colors.\nSticker manufacturer Fleer included rub-off game cards with its \"Pac-Man\" stickers. The card packages contain a \"Pac-Man\" style maze with all points along the path hidden with opaque coverings. From the starting position, the player moves around the maze while scratching off the coverings to score points.\nPerfect scores and other records.\nA perfect score on the original \"Pac-Man\" arcade game is 3,333,360 points, achieved when the player obtains the maximum score on the first 255 levels by eating every dot, energizer, fruit and blue ghost without losing a life, then uses all six lives to obtain the maximum possible number of points on level 256.\nThe first person to achieve a publicly witnessed and verified perfect score without manipulating the game's hardware to freeze play was Billy Mitchell, who performed the feat on July 3, 1999. Some record keeping organizations removed Mitchell's score after a 2018 investigation by Twin Galaxies concluded that two unrelated \"Donkey Kong\" score performances submitted by Mitchell had not used an unmodified original circuit board. As of July 2020, seven other gamers had achieved perfect \"Pac-Man\" scores on original arcade hardware. The world record for the fastest completion of a perfect score, according to Twin Galaxies, is held by David Race with a time of 3 hours, 28 minutes, 49 seconds.\nIn December 1982, eight-year-old boy Jeffrey R. Yee received a letter from United States president Ronald Reagan congratulating him on a world record score of 6,131,940 points, possible only if he had passed level 256. In September 1983, Walter Day, chief scorekeeper at Twin Galaxies at the time, took the U.S. National Video Game Team on a tour of the East Coast to visit gamers who claimed the ability to pass that level. None demonstrated such an ability. In 1999, Billy Mitchell offered $100,000 to anyone who could pass level 256 before January 1, 2000. The offer expired with the prize unclaimed.\nAfter announcing in 2018 that it would no longer recognize the first perfect score on \"Pac-Man\", Guinness World Records reversed that decision and reinstated Billy Mitchell's 1999 performance on June 18, 2020.\nRemakes and sequels.\n\"Pac-Man\" was followed by a series of sequels, remakes, and re-imaginings, and is one of the longest-running video game franchises in history. The first of these was \"Ms. Pac-Man\", developed by the American-based General Computer Corporation and published by Midway in 1982. The character's gender was changed to female in response to \"Pac-Man\"'s popularity with women, with new mazes, moving bonus items, and faster gameplay being implemented to increase its appeal. \"Ms. Pac-Man\" is one of the best-selling arcade games in North America, where \"Pac-Man\" and \"Ms. Pac-Man\" had become the most successful machines in the history of the amusement arcade industry. Legal concerns raised over who owned the game caused \"Ms. Pac-Man\" to become owned by Namco, who assisted in production of the game. \"Ms. Pac-Man\" inspired its own line of remakes, including \"Ms. Pac-Man Maze Madness\" (2000), and \"\", and is included in many Namco and \"Pac-Man\" collections for consoles.\nNamco's own follow-up to the original was \"Super Pac-Man\", released in 1982. This was followed by the Japan-exclusive \"Pac &amp; Pal\" in 1983. Midway produced many other \"Pac-Man\" sequels during the early 1980s, including \"Pac-Man Plus\" (1982), \"Jr. Pac-Man\" (1983), \"Baby Pac-Man\" (1983), and \"Professor Pac-Man\" (1984). Other games include the isometric \"Pac-Mania\" (1987), the side-scrollers \"Pac-Land\" (1984), \"\" (1994), and \"Pac-In-Time\" (1995), the 3D platformer \"Pac-Man World\" (1999), and the puzzle games \"Pac-Attack\" (1991) and \"Pac-Pix\" (2005). Iwatani designed \"Pac-Land\" and \"Pac-Mania\", both of which remain his favorite games in the series. \"Pac-Man Championship Edition\", published for the Xbox 360 in 2007, was Iwatani's final game before leaving the company. Its neon visuals and fast-paced gameplay was met with acclaim, leading to the creation of \"Pac-Man Championship Edition DX\" (2010) and \"Pac-Man Championship Edition 2\" (2016).\nColeco's tabletop Mini-Arcade versions of the game yielded 1.5\u00a0million units sold in 1982. Nelsonic Industries produced a \"Pac-Man\" LCD wristwatch game with a simplified maze also in 1982.\nNamco Networks sold a downloadable Windows PC version of \"Pac-Man\" in 2009 which also includes an enhanced mode which replaces all of the original sprites with the sprites from \"Pac-Man Championship Edition\". Namco Networks made a downloadable bundle which includes its PC version of \"Pac-Man\" and its port of \"Dig Dug\" called \"\". In 2010, Namco Bandai announced the release of the game on Windows Phone 7 as an Xbox Live game.\nFor the weekend of May 21\u201323, 2010, Google changed the logo on its homepage to a playable version of the game in recognition of the 30th anniversary of the game's release. The Google Doodle version of \"Pac-Man\" was estimated to have been played by more than 1\u00a0billion people worldwide in 2010, so Google later gave the game its own page.\nIn April 2011, Soap Creative published \"World's Biggest Pac-Man\", working together with Microsoft and Namco-Bandai to celebrate \"Pac-Man\"'s 30th anniversary. It is a multiplayer browser-based game with user-created, interlocking mazes.\nFor April Fools' Day in 2017, Google created a playable of the game on Google Maps where users were able to play the game using the map onscreen.\nA \"Pac-Man\"-themed downloadable content package for \"Minecraft\" was released in 2020 in commemoration of the game's 40th anniversary. This pack introduced a ghost called 'Creepy', based on the Creeper.\nTechnology.\nThe original arcade system board had one Z80A processor, running at 3.072\u00a0MHz, 16\u00a0kbyte of ROM and 3\u00a0kbyte of static RAM. Of those 1\u00a0kbyte each was for video RAM, color RAM and generic program RAM. There were two custom chips on the board: the 285 sync bus controller and the 284 video RAM addresser, but daughterboards made only from standard parts were also widely used instead. Video output was (analog) component video with composite sync. A further 8\u00a0kbyte of character ROM was used for characters, background tiles and sprites and an additional 1\u00a0kbit of static RAM was used to hold 4bpp sprite data for one scanline and was written to during the horizontal blanking period preceding each line. Sprite size was always 16x16 pixels, one of the four colors per pixel was for transparency (of the background).\nThe monitor was installed 90 degree rotated clockwise, the first visible scanline started in the top right corner and ends in the bottom right corner. The horizontal blanking period, which starts after the level indicator at the bottom is drawn, had a duration of 96 pixel clock ticks, enough time to fetch 4 bytes of sprite data per 16 clock ticks for 6 sprites. Although attribute memory exists for them, sprites 0 and 7 are unusable: Their pixel fetch timing windows are occupied by the bottom level indicator (which just precedes the hblank) for sprite 0 and two rows of characters at the top of the screen, which just follow the hblank, for sprite 7.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The novel was later adapted into a feature film in 2002 and a television series in 2014.\nPlot summary.\nSet in 1993 London, \"About a Boy\" features two main protagonists: Will Freeman, a 36-year-old bachelor, and Marcus Brewer, a 12-year-old incongruous schoolboy described as \"introverted\" by his suicidal mother, Fiona, despite his tendencies to bond and interact with people. Will's father wrote a successful Christmas song, the royalties of which have afforded Will the ability to remain voluntarily redundant throughout his life \u2013 he spends his plentiful free time immersing himself in 1990s culture, music, and pursuing sexual relations with women.\nAfter a pleasant relationship with Angie, a single mother of two, Will comes up with the idea of attending a single parents group as a new way to pick up women. For this purpose, he invents a two-year-old son called Ned. Will then makes a number of acquaintances through his membership of the single parents group, two of which are Fiona and her son Marcus. Although their relationship is initially somewhat strained, they finally succeed in striking up a true friendship despite Will being largely uninterested during the early-middle stages of the novel. Will, a socially aware and \"trendy\" person, aids Marcus to fit into 1990s youth culture by encouraging him not to get his hair cut by his mother, buying him Adidas trainers, and introducing him to contemporary music, such as Nirvana. Marcus and Will's friendship strengthens as the story progresses, even after Marcus and Fiona discover Will's lie about having a child.\nMarcus is befriended by Ellie McCrae, a tough, moody 15-year-old girl, who is constantly in trouble at school because she insists on wearing a Kurt Cobain jumper. He also spends some time with his dad Clive, who visits Marcus and Fiona for Christmas together with his new girlfriend Lindsey and her mother. Clive has a minor accident during some D.I.Y. work, and breaks his collarbone. This prompts Clive into having \"a big think\" about the meaning of his life, and he summons Marcus to Cambridge to see him. Marcus decides to bring Ellie along with him for support; however, they are arrested on the way as Ellie smashes a shop window displaying a cardboard cut-out of Kurt Cobain, who has just died \u2013 Ellie accuses the shopkeeper of \"trying to make money out of [Cobain]\" after his suicide.\nMeanwhile, to Will's despair, he falls in love with a woman called Rachel. Rachel is a single mother with a son named Ali (Alistair), who is the same age as Marcus. The two originally fight, but quickly become friends. Will's emotional faculties are liberated and he begins to \"shed [his] old skin\" of emotional indifference; simultaneously Marcus is becoming more typical of his age, and he begins to enjoy his life more.\nThe penultimate scene takes place in a police station in Royston (a small suburban town), where nearly every significant character in the novel is present, their common link being Marcus. The novel ends during a three-way dialogue between Marcus, Will and Fiona, where Will, to see if Marcus has truly changed, proposes the idea that he play a Joni Mitchell song on Fiona's piano, which she is enthusiastic about. However, Marcus responds saying he \"hates\" Joni Mitchell, whereby Hornby concludes the novel with the narration saying \"Will knew Marcus would be OK\".\nTitle.\nThe title is a reference to the song \"About a Girl\" by Nirvana. This was confirmed by the author in the 2 December 2001 edition of the BBC Radio 4 series \"Book Club\". The band is also mentioned several times in the book.\nIn other media.\nFilm.\nA film adaptation was released in 2002 by Chris and Paul Weitz. It starred Nicholas Hoult as Marcus, Hugh Grant as Will, Toni Collette as Fiona, and Rachel Weisz as Rachel. While the screenplay closely follows Hornby's novel, it omits scenes involving drug use and has a different ending. It removes any reference to the band Nirvana and Kurt Cobain; instead, Will introduces Marcus to rap music. The soundtrack to the film, including several full songs and numerous incidental pieces, was composed entirely by British singer-songwriter Badly Drawn Boy, apart from the song featured in the plot, \"Killing Me Softly with His Song\". The film received positive reviews from critics, was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay, and earned $130,549,455 at the box office against a $30\u00a0million budget.\nTelevision.\nThe movie was also the basis for a 2014 American television series, which aired on NBC. The show's pilot episode was directed by Jon Favreau. It lasted for two seasons (33 episodes) before being cancelled by NBC on 8 May 2015.\nAudiobook.\nAn unabridged version is available by Penguin Audio and narrated by David Case.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Coached by Vladislav Rastorotsky (who later trained Natalia Shaposhnikova and Natalia Yurchenko), she represented the Soviet Union at the 1968 Summer Olympics, just after her 16th birthday. She won the gold medal with the team and placed 24th in the all-around.\nTwo years later, Tourischeva became the leader of the Soviet team. From 1970 to 1974, she dominated almost every major international competition, winning the World Championships all-around gold in 1970 and 1974, the European Championships in 1971 and 1973, and the World Cup in 1975.\nAt the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich, Tourischeva won the all-around gold medal but was overshadowed by the sudden popularity of her younger compatriot Olga Korbut. She qualified for all four event finals, and won a silver and a bronze. Tourischeva was one of the first female gymnasts to use two separate pieces of music for her floor routines at an international competition. For the team competition, she used \"March\" from the film \"Circus\" by Isaak Dunaevsky, while for the all around, she used the music to the film \"Die Frau meiner Tr\u00e4ume\" by Franz Grothe.\nAt the 1975 European Championships, Tourischeva placed fourth in the all-around behind 13-year-old Nadia Com\u0103neci of Romania (who also won the vault, uneven bars, and balance beam apparatus finals), her own teammate Nellie Kim (who placed second and won the floor exercise final) and Annelore Zinke. This marked the first time in 5 years that Ludmilla lost an all-around competition.\nAfter struggling with a back injury, Tourischeva competed in her third Olympics, the 1976 Summer Games in Montreal, where she won her third team gold with the Soviet squad. In the all-around, she finished third behind Com\u0103neci and Kim. She won silver medals on vault and floor exercise in the event finals, losing to Kim but overcoming Com\u0103neci, bringing her total Olympic medal count to four gold, three silver, and two bronze.\nTourischeva was known for her calm demeanor in competition. In 1980, British journalist David Hunn wrote that she \"never had the cheek of some of her rivals, but for serenity she was supreme\". This was famously illustrated during the 1975 World Cup at Wembley Stadium in London, when a broken hook holding support cables of the uneven bars caused the apparatus to fall apart and crash to the ground just as Tourischeva landed her dismount. Saluting the judges, she walked off the podium without even turning around to look at the remains of the apparatus. She went on to win the all-around and all four event finals. Years later, she said of the incident that, at that moment, she had thought only one thing: she must complete her routine and \"stick it\". Rastorotsky, her coach, said, \"Ljudmila would fight to death in any situation.\"\nShe was also known for her gracious manner. At the 1976 Olympics, she walked around the podium to personally congratulate champion Com\u0103neci and shake her hand before accepting her own medal.\nTourischeva is one of only two women, the other being Yelena Shushunova, who have won the \"grand slam\" of all-around titles: Olympics, World Championships, World Cup, and European Championships. She is also one of only two women to win four gold medals at a single World Championships (in 1974). The other is Simone Biles of the United States, who won four in 2014, 2015, and 2018; Biles broke the record and won five gold medals in 2019.\nPost-gymnastics life.\nIn 1977, Tourischeva married the sprinter Valeriy Borzov, a two-time Olympic champion, in 1972. She was elected to the Women's Artistic Gymnastics Technical Committee of the International Gymnastics Federation (FIG) in 1981, and has remained involved in gymnastics as a coach, an international judge, and an official with the Ukrainian gymnastics federation. One of her prot\u00e9g\u00e9s was Lilia Podkopayeva of Ukraine, the all-around gold medalist at the 1996 Olympics.\nTourischeva has received various honors for her gymnastics career, including the Women in Sport trophy from the International Olympic Committee. In 1998, she was inducted into the International Gymnastics Hall of Fame.\nEponymous skill.\nTourischeva has one eponymous skill listed in the Code of Points.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is known for always hitting the target of the attacker regardless of the attacker's skill.\nAttestations.\n\"Poetic Edda\".\nIn the Poetic Edda poem \"V\u00f6lusp\u00e1\", the \u00c6sir-Vanir War is described as officially starting when Odin throws a spear over the heads of an assembly of Vanir gods. Whether or not this was specifically Gungnir is, however, unstated. In \"Sigrdr\u00edfum\u00e1l\", the valkyrie Sigrdr\u00edfa advises Sigurd on the magical application of runes. She gives Sigurd advice and shares with him lore, including that runes were carved on the tip of Gungnir.\n\"Prose Edda\".\nAccording to chapter 51 of the \"Prose Edda\" book, \"Gylfaginning\", Odin will ride in front of the Einherjar while advancing on to the battle field at Ragnar\u00f6k wearing a gold helmet, an impressive cloak of mail and carrying Gungnir. He will then attack the wolf Fenrir with it.\nIn \"Sk\u00e1ldskaparm\u00e1l\", more information regarding the spear is presented. The spear was fashioned by the dwarves known as the Sons of Ivaldi under the mastery of the blacksmith dwarf Dvalinn. The spear was obtained from the dwarfs by Loki, the result of a scheme he concocted as a partial reparation for his cutting of the goddess Sif's hair. The spear is described as being so well balanced that it could strike any target, no matter the skill or strength of the wielder.\nArchaeological record.\nIf the rider on horseback on the image on the B\u00f6ksta Runestone has been identified as Odin, then Odin is shown carrying Gungnir while hunting an elk.\nIn the \"Ring of the Nibelung\".\nIn Richard Wagner's opera cycle, \"Der Ring des Nibelungen\", Wotan's (Odin's) spear is made from the wood of the world tree, the ash tree Yggdrasil, and engraved with the contracts from which Wotan's power derives. He uses the spear to break the sword of Siegmund, leading to Siegmund's death. When he later tries to bar Siegmund's son Siegfried from awakening Br\u00fcnnhilde from her magic sleep, Siegfried breaks the spear in two and Wotan flees. In the concluding opera \"G\u00f6tterd\u00e4mmerung\" Wotan is said to have returned to his stronghold Valhalla with the broken spear and withdrawn from worldly matters.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

One of the last popes of the Byzantine Papacy, the defining moment of his pontificate was his 710/711 visit to Constantinople, where he compromised with Justinian II on the Trullan canons of the Quinisext Council. The city's next papal visit occurred in 1967.\nUpbringing.\nConstantine was born in Tyre in the Umayyad Caliphate (now in Lebanon), and he was of Greek descent. Fluent in the Greek language, he immersed in Eastern rituals and practices. By his upbringing, he would have been \"fully at ease in the oriental milieu of the early-eighth-century Byzantine court\". Except for Antipope Constantine, he was the only pope to bear such a \"quintessentially\" Eastern name of an emperor.\nBefore his selection as pope, he had visited Constantinople twice. He was one of the papal legates to the Third Council of Constantinople in 680/681. He also delivered a combative letter from Pope Leo II to Emperor Constantine IV in 682. He met and developed a rapport with Constantine IV's son Justinian II on both occasions.\nPontificate.\nConstantine's predecessor, Sisinnius, was pope for only twenty days. Constantine became pope in March 708, less than two months later. He was one of the many Greek popes of the Byzantine Papacy, the period during which Rome was under the rule of the Byzantine Empire and popes required the approval of the emperor for consecration as pope. The defining issue of the papacy at the time of Constantine's election was the Western rejection of the Trullan canons of the Quinisext Council. Pope John VII had been sent the canons for approval and instead had sent them back, \"without any emendations at all\". John VII's predecessor, Sergius I, had declared that he would rather die than subscribe to the council.\nVisit to Constantinople.\nIn 710, Emperor Justinian II demanded in a \"iussio\" that Pope Constantine appear before him in Constantinople. The imperial mandate made it \"obvious that the relentless emperor meant to settle once and for all the issue of Rome's acceptance of the Trullan decrees\". Unlike his predecessors, Constantine neither delayed nor made excuses to avoid appearing in the imperial city; in fact, he \"identified with Byzantium as perhaps no Roman pontiff before him ever had\". Prior to Constantine's departure, Justinian had blinded Archbishop Felix of Ravenna for plotting to overthrow him, an act that had improved the papal-Byzantine rapport. His primary motivation for the trip was to forestall a rift between Rome and Constantinople over the Trullan decrees.\nConstantine departed on 5 October 710. In Constantinople, Constantine stayed in the Placidia Palace, which had formerly been occupied by Pope Vigilius in 547, the representatives of Popes Martin I and Agatho (while attending the Third Council of Constantinople). Eleven of Constantine's thirteen companions who can be identified by name (two bishops, three priests, and all the ranking members of the papal chancellery and household) were also of Eastern extraction. Also accompanying Constantine was the future Pope Gregory II, then a deacon, and another Latin subdeacon Julian. Constantine specifically chose attendants who were \"cut from similar cloth\" as he, and likely to be sympathetic to the East.\nWhile stopping in transit in Naples, Constantine crossed paths with the exarch of Ravenna, John III Rizocopo, then on his way to Rome to execute four high-ranking papal officials by cutting their throats. The four (as evidenced by their staying behind) were opposed to Constantine's new policy of rapprochement with Constantinople. Doubtlessly, Constantine himself learned of the exarch's errand before departing for Sicily, then Gallipoli, and then Otranto, where the group stayed for winter. In the spring, Constantine crossed the Ionian Sea, meeting the \"strategos\" of the imperial fleet on the island of Chios and was received by the Karabisianoi before proceeding to Constantinople.\nConstantine entered Constantinople on a \"horse caparisoned with gilded saddle clothes and golden bridles and bearing on his head the \"kamelaukion\", or diadem, which the sovereign alone was authorized to wear and then only on 'a great public festival of the Lord'\". Justinian II's son and co-emperor Tiberius, along with Patriarch Kyros, senators, nobles, clerics, and many others, greeted Constantine at the seventh milestone from the city in the style of an imperial \"adventus\". Justinian II was in Nicaea at the time and urged the pontiff to meet him in Nicomedia. The \"Liber pontificalis\" recounts a bizarre scene of the crowned emperor prostrating himself before the pope, but a more mutual greeting is probable. That Sunday, Justinian II received communion from the hands of the pope and issued a vague confirmation of the various privileges of the Roman See.\nThe negotiations regarding the Trullan canons were conducted by the future Pope Gregory II. A degree of compromise (the \"so-called Compromise of Nicomedia\")\u2014which \"diplomatically skirted\" the actual issue of their acceptance\u2014was reached. While Constantine made concessions regarding the \"economia\", he did not give ground on the vast majority of the Roman grievances. The agreement was more designed to secure East\u2013West political unity than resolve any doctrinal dispute. The fact of Constantine's having been summoned to Constantinople was the real proof that the \"imperial writ still ran in Rome\". Constantine left Constantinople in October 711. He was the last pope to visit the city until Paul VI did in 1967.\nRejection of monothelitism.\nJustinian II was killed by his mutinous troops in November 711, shortly after Constantine's return to Rome. The new emperor, Philippicus, was an adherent of monothelitism, and rejected the arrangements of the Third Council of Constantinople. He demanded Constantine's support of the view that Christ had only one will. In 712, Constantine rejected Philippicus' demand to revive monothelitism. He further refused to receive an imperial portrait or coins with the emperor's image and also refused to commemorate the emperor in Mass.\nAs the exarch attempted to enforce the imperial presence, clashes occurred, which Constantine calmed. Philippicus was overthrown in June 713 and his successor, Anastasius II, sent Exarch Scholasticus and a letter to the pope affirming imperial support for the Sixth General Council.\nDeath.\nUpon his death in Rome on 9 April 715, Constantine was succeeded by Pope Gregory II.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "74263", "revid": "26394783", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=74263", "title": "Frame of reference", "text": "Abstract coordinate system\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Hlist/styles.css\"/&gt;\nIn physics and astronomy, a frame of reference (or reference frame) is an abstract coordinate system, whose origin, orientation, and scale have been specified in physical space. It is based on a set of reference points, defined as geometric points whose position is identified both mathematically (with numerical coordinate values) and physically (signaled by conventional markers).\nAn important special case is that of an \"inertial reference frame\", a stationary or uniformly moving frame.\nFor \"n\" dimensions, \"n\" + 1 reference points are sufficient to fully define a reference frame. Using rectangular Cartesian coordinates, a reference frame may be defined with a reference point at the origin and a reference point at one unit distance from the origin along each of the \"n\" coordinate axes.\nIn Einsteinian relativity, reference frames are used to specify the relationship between a moving observer and the phenomenon under observation. In this context, the term often becomes observational frame of reference (or observational reference frame), which implies that the observer is at rest in the frame, although not necessarily located at its origin. A relativistic reference frame includes (or implies) the coordinate time, which does not equate across different reference frames moving relatively to each other. The situation thus differs from Galilean relativity, in which all possible coordinate times are essentially equivalent.\nDefinition.\nThe need to distinguish between the various meanings of \"frame of reference\" has led to a variety of terms. For example, sometimes the type of coordinate system is attached as a modifier, as in \"Cartesian frame of reference\". Sometimes the state of motion is emphasized, as in \"rotating frame of reference\". Sometimes the way it transforms to frames considered as related is emphasized as in \"Galilean frame of reference\". Sometimes frames are distinguished by the scale of their observations, as in \"macroscopic\" and \"microscopic frames of reference\".\nIn this article, the term \"observational frame of reference\" is used when emphasis is upon the \"state of motion\" rather than upon the coordinate choice or the character of the observations or observational apparatus. In this sense, an observational frame of reference allows study of the effect of motion upon an entire family of coordinate systems that could be attached to this frame. On the other hand, a \"coordinate system\" may be employed for many purposes where the state of motion is not the primary concern. For example, a coordinate system may be adopted to take advantage of the symmetry of a system. In a still broader perspective, the formulation of many problems in physics employs \"generalized coordinates\", \"normal modes\" or \"eigenvectors\", which are only indirectly related to space and time. It seems useful to divorce the various aspects of a reference frame for the discussion below. We therefore take observational frames of reference, coordinate systems, and observational equipment as independent concepts, separated as below:\nCoordinate systems.\nAlthough the term \"coordinate system\" is often used (particularly by physicists) in a nontechnical sense, the term \"coordinate system\" does have a precise meaning in mathematics, and sometimes that is what the physicist means as well.\nA coordinate system in mathematics is a facet of geometry or of algebra, in particular, a property of manifolds (for example, in physics, configuration spaces or phase spaces). The coordinates of a point r in an \"n\"-dimensional space are simply an ordered set of \"n\" numbers: \n formula_1\nIn a general Banach space, these numbers could be (for example) coefficients in a functional expansion like a Fourier series. In a physical problem, they could be spacetime coordinates or normal mode amplitudes. In a robot design, they could be angles of relative rotations, linear displacements, or deformations of joints. Here we will suppose these coordinates can be related to a Cartesian coordinate system by a set of functions:\n formula_2\nwhere \"x\", \"y\", \"z\", \"etc.\" are the \"n\" Cartesian coordinates of the point. Given these functions, coordinate surfaces are defined by the relations:\n formula_3\nThe intersection of these surfaces define coordinate lines. At any selected point, tangents to the intersecting coordinate lines at that point define a set of basis vectors {e1, e2, ..., en} at that point. That is:\n formula_4\nwhich can be normalized to be of unit length. For more detail see curvilinear coordinates.\nCoordinate surfaces, coordinate lines, and basis vectors are components of a coordinate system. If the basis vectors are orthogonal at every point, the coordinate system is an orthogonal coordinate system.\nAn important aspect of a coordinate system is its metric tensor \"gik\", which determines the arc length \"ds\" in the coordinate system in terms of its coordinates:\n formula_5\nwhere repeated indices are summed over.\nAs is apparent from these remarks, a coordinate system is a mathematical construct, part of an axiomatic system. There is no necessary connection between coordinate systems and physical motion (or any other aspect of reality). However, coordinate systems can include time as a coordinate, and can be used to describe motion. Thus, Lorentz transformations and Galilean transformations may be viewed as coordinate transformations.\nObservational frame of reference.\nAn observational frame of reference, often referred to as a \"physical frame of reference\", a \"frame of reference\", or simply a \"frame\", is a physical concept related to an observer and the observer's state of motion. Here we adopt the view expressed by Kumar and Barve: an observational frame of reference is characterized \"only by its state of motion\". However, there is lack of unanimity on this point. In special relativity, the distinction is sometimes made between an \"observer\" and a \"frame\". According to this view, a \"frame\" is an \"observer\" plus a coordinate lattice constructed to be an orthonormal right-handed set of spacelike vectors perpendicular to a timelike vector. See Doran. This restricted view is not used here, and is not universally adopted even in discussions of relativity. In general relativity the use of general coordinate systems is common (see, for example, the Schwarzschild solution for the gravitational field outside an isolated sphere).\nThere are two types of observational reference frame: inertial and non-inertial. An inertial frame of reference is defined as one in which all laws of physics take on their simplest form. In special relativity these frames are related by Lorentz transformations, which are parametrized by rapidity. In Newtonian mechanics, a more restricted definition requires only that Newton's first law holds true; that is, a Newtonian inertial frame is one in which a free particle travels in a straight line at constant speed, or is at rest. These frames are related by Galilean transformations. These relativistic and Newtonian transformations are expressed in spaces of general dimension in terms of representations of the Poincar\u00e9 group and of the Galilean group.\nIn contrast to the inertial frame, a non-inertial frame of reference is one in which fictitious forces must be invoked to explain observations. An example is an observational frame of reference centered at a point on the Earth's surface. This frame of reference orbits around the center of the Earth, which introduces the fictitious forces known as the Coriolis force, centrifugal force, and gravitational force. (All of these forces including gravity disappear in a truly inertial reference frame, which is one of free-fall.)\nMeasurement apparatus.\nA further aspect of a frame of reference is the role of the measurement apparatus (for example, clocks and rods) attached to the frame (see Norton quote above). This question is not addressed in this article, and is of particular interest in quantum mechanics, where the relation between observer and measurement is still under discussion (see measurement problem).\nIn physics experiments, the frame of reference in which the laboratory measurement devices are at rest is usually referred to as the laboratory frame or simply \"lab frame.\" An example would be the frame in which the detectors for a particle accelerator are at rest. The lab frame in some experiments is an inertial frame, but it is not required to be (for example the laboratory on the surface of the Earth in many physics experiments is not inertial). In particle physics experiments, it is often useful to transform energies and momenta of particles from the lab frame where they are measured, to the center of momentum frame \"COM frame\" in which calculations are sometimes simplified, since potentially all kinetic energy still present in the COM frame may be used for making new particles.\nIn this connection it may be noted that the clocks and rods often used to describe observers' measurement equipment in thought, in practice are replaced by a much more complicated and indirect metrology that is connected to the nature of the vacuum, and uses atomic clocks that operate according to the Standard Model and that must be corrected for gravitational time dilation. (See second, meter and kilogram).\nIn fact, Einstein felt that clocks and rods were merely expedient measuring devices and they should be replaced by more fundamental entities based upon, for example, atoms and molecules.\nGeneralization.\nThe discussion is taken beyond simple space-time coordinate systems by Brading and Castellani. Extension to coordinate systems using generalized coordinates underlies the Hamiltonian and Lagrangian formulations of quantum field theory, classical relativistic mechanics, and quantum gravity.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He was one of the four original members of the Tetrarchy established by Diocletian, first serving as \"caesar\" from 293 to 305 and then ruling as \"augustus\" until his death. Constantius was also father of Constantine the Great, the first Christian emperor of Rome. The nickname \"Chlorus\" () was first popularized by Byzantine-era historians and not used during the emperor's lifetime.\nAs an Illyrian soldier of humble origin, Constantius had a distinguished military career and rose to the top ranks of the army. Around 289, he set aside Helena, Constantine's mother, to marry a daughter of Emperor Maximian, and in 293 was added to the imperial college by Maximian's colleague Diocletian. Assigned to rule Gaul, Constantius defeated the usurper Carausius there and his successor Allectus in Britain, and campaigned extensively along the Rhine frontier, defeating the Alamanni and Franks. When the Diocletianic Persecution was announced in 303, Constantius ordered the demolition of churches but did not actively hunt down Christians in his domain. Upon becoming senior emperor in May 305, Constantius launched a successful punitive campaign against the Picts beyond the Antonine Wall. He died suddenly at Eboracum (York) in July the following year.\nAfter Constantius's death, the army, perhaps at his own instigation, immediately acclaimed his son Constantine as emperor. This act contributed to the collapse of the Diocletianic tetrarchy, sparking a series of civil wars which only ended when Constantine finally united the whole Roman Empire under his rule in 324. According to the \"Oxford Classical Dictionary\", \"Constantinian propaganda bedevils assessment of Constantius, yet he appears to have been an able general and a generous ruler\". His descendants, the Constantinian dynasty, ruled the Empire until the death of his grandson Julian in 363.\nLife.\nEarly career.\nConstantius's birthday was 31 March; the year is unknown, but his career and the age of his eldest son imply a date no later than c. 250. Constantius was an Illyrian. He was born in Moesia Superior (later Dacia Ripensis), a Roman province on the south bank of the Middle Danube. According to the unreliable \"Historia Augusta\" he was the son of Eutropius, a nobleman from the province of Moesia Superior, and Claudia, a niece of the emperors Claudius Gothicus and Quintillus. The same source also gives Claudius the nomina \"Flavius Valerius\" to strengthen his connection to Constantius. Modern historians suspect this maternal connection to be a genealogical fabrication created by his son Constantine I, and that his family was of humble origins. Constantine probably sought to dissociate his father's background from the memory of Maximian.\nConstantius was a member of the \"Protectores Augusti Nostri\" under the emperor Aurelian and fought in the east against the secessionist Palmyrene Empire. While the claim that he had been made a \"dux\" under the emperor Probus is probably a fabrication, he certainly attained the rank of \"tribunus\" within the army, and during the reign of Carus he was raised to the position of \"praeses\", or governor, of the province of Dalmatia. It has been conjectured that he switched allegiances to support the claims of the future emperor Diocletian just before Diocletian defeated Carinus, the son of Carus, at the Battle of the Margus in July 285.\nIn 286, Diocletian elevated a military colleague, Maximian, to the throne as co-emperor of the western provinces, while Diocletian took over the eastern provinces, beginning the process that would eventually see the division of the Roman Empire into two halves, a Western and an Eastern portion. By 288, his period as governor now over, Constantius had been made praetorian prefect in the west under Maximian. Throughout 287 and into 288, Constantius, under the command of Maximian, was involved in a war against the Alamanni, carrying out attacks on the territory of the barbarian tribes across the Rhine and Danube rivers. To consolidate the ties between himself and Emperor Maximian, Constantius married the emperor's daughter, Theodora.\nElevation as Caesar.\nBy 293, Diocletian, conscious of the ambitions of his co-emperor for his new son-in-law, allowed Maximian to promote Constantius in a new power sharing arrangement known as the Tetrarchy. The eastern and western provinces would each be ruled by an \"augustus\", supported by a \"caesar\". Both \"caesares\" had the right of succession once the ruling \"augustus\" died.\nAt Mediolanum (Milan) on 1 March 293, Constantius was formally appointed as Maximian's \"caesar\". He adopted Diocletian's \"nomen\" (family name) \"Valerius\", and, being equated with Maximian, also took on \"Herculius\". His given command consisted of Gaul, Britannia and possibly Hispania. Diocletian, the eastern \"augustus\", in order to keep the balance of power in the \"imperium\", elevated Galerius as his \"caesar\", possibly on 21 May 293 at Philippopolis (Plovdiv). Constantius was the more senior of the two \"caesares\", and on official documents he always took precedence, being mentioned before Galerius. Constantius's capital was to be located at Augusta Treverorum (Trier).\nConstantius's first task on becoming \"caesar\" was to deal with the Roman usurper Carausius who had declared himself emperor in Britannia and northern Gaul in 286. In late 293, Constantius defeated the forces of Carausius in Gaul, capturing Bononia (Boulogne-sur-Mer). Carausius was then assassinated by his \"rationalis\" (finance officer) Allectus, who assumed command of the British provinces until his death in 296.\nConstantius spent the next two years neutralising the threat of the Franks who were the allies of Allectus, as northern Gaul remained under the control of the British usurper until at least 295. He also battled against the Alamanni, achieving some victories at the mouth of the Rhine in 295. Administrative concerns meant he made at least one trip to Italy during this time as well. Only when he felt ready (and only when Maximian finally came to relieve him at the Rhine frontier) did he assemble two invasion fleets with the intent of crossing the English Channel. The first was entrusted to Julius Asclepiodotus, Constantius's long-serving Praetorian prefect, who sailed from the mouth of the Seine, while the other, under the command of Constantius himself, was launched from his base at Bononia. The fleet under Asclepiodotus landed near the Isle of Wight, and his army encountered the forces of Allectus, resulting in the defeat and death of the usurper. Constantius in the meantime occupied Londinium (London), saving the city from an attack by Frankish mercenaries who were now roaming the province without a paymaster. Constantius massacred all of them.\nConstantius remained in Britannia for a few months, replaced most of Allectus's officers, and the British provinces were probably at this time subdivided along the lines of Diocletian's other administrative reforms of the Empire. The result was the division of Britannia Superior into Maxima Caesariensis and Britannia Prima, while Flavia Caesariensis and Britannia Secunda were carved out of Britannia Inferior. He also restored Hadrian's Wall and its forts.\nLater in 298, Constantius fought in the Battle of Lingones (Langres) against the Alemanni. He was shut up in the city, but was relieved by his army after six hours and defeated the enemy. He defeated them again at Vindonissa thereby strengthening the defences of the Rhine frontier. In 300, he fought against the Franks on the Rhine frontier, and as part of his overall strategy to buttress the frontier, Constantius settled the Franks in the deserted parts of Gaul to repopulate the devastated areas. Nevertheless, over the next three years the Rhine frontier continued to occupy Constantius's attention.\nFrom 303 \u2013 the beginning of the Diocletianic Persecution \u2013 Constantius began to enforce the imperial edicts dealing with the persecution of Christians, which ordered the destruction of churches. The campaign was avidly pursued by Galerius, who noticed that Constantius was well-disposed towards the Christians, and who saw it as a method of advancing his career prospects with the aging Diocletian. Of the four Tetrarchs, Constantius made the least effort to implement the decrees in the western provinces that were under his direct authority, limiting himself to knocking down a handful of churches. Eusebius denied that Constantius destroyed Christian buildings, but Lactantius records that he did.\nAccession as Augustus and death.\nBetween 303 and 305, Galerius began maneuvering to ensure that he would be in a position to take power from Constantius after the death of Diocletian. In 304, Maximian met with Galerius, probably to discuss the succession issue and Constantius either was not invited or could not make it due to the situation on the Rhine. Although prior to 303 there appeared to be tacit agreement among the Tetrarchs that Constantius's son Constantine and Maximian's son Maxentius were to be promoted to the rank of \"caesar\" once Diocletian and Maximian had resigned the purple, by the end of 304 Galerius had convinced Diocletian (who in turn convinced Maximian) to appoint Galerius's nominees Severus and Maximinus as \"caesares\".\nDiocletian and Maximian stepped down as co-emperors on 1 May 305, possibly due to Diocletian's poor health. Before the assembled armies at Mediolanum, Maximian removed his purple cloak and handed it to Severus, the new \"caesar\", and proclaimed Constantius as \"augustus\". The same scene played out at Nicomedia (\u0130zmit) under the authority of Diocletian. Constantius, notionally the senior emperor, ruled the western provinces, while Galerius took the eastern provinces. Constantine, disappointed in his hopes to become a \"caesar\", fled the court of Galerius after Constantius had asked Galerius to release his son as Constantius was ill. Constantine joined his father's court at the coast of Gaul, just as he was preparing to campaign in Britain.\nIn 305, Constantius crossed over into Britain, travelled to the far north of the island and launched a military expedition against the Picts, claiming a victory against them and the title \"Britannicus Maximus II\" by 7 January 306. After retiring to Eboracum (York) for the winter, Constantius had planned to continue the campaign, but on 25 July 306 he died. As he was dying, Constantius recommended his son to the army as his successor; consequently, Constantine was declared emperor by the legions at York.\nFamily.\nConstantius was either married to, or was in concubinage with, Helena, who was probably from Nicomedia in Asia Minor. They had one son, the future emperor Constantine the Great.\nIn 289, political developments forced him to divorce Helena. He married Theodora, Maximian's daughter. They had six children:\nThe name of Anastasia () may indicate a sympathy with Christian or Jewish culture."}

The two colonies were formed in 1791, when the British Parliament passed the \"Constitutional Act\", splitting the colonial Province of Quebec into two separate colonies. The Ottawa River formed the border between Lower and Upper Canada.\nThe Canadas were merged into a single entity in 1841, shortly after Lord Durham published his \"Report on the Affairs of British North America\". His report held several recommendations, most notably union of the Canadas. Acting on his recommendation, the British Parliament passed the \"Act of Union 1840\", which went into effect in 1841, uniting the Canadas into the Province of Canada. \nThe terms \"Lower\" and \"Upper\" refer to the colony's position relative to the headwaters of the St. Lawrence River.\nHistory.\nThe two colonies were created in 1791 with the passage of the \"Constitutional Act 1791\". As a result of the influx of Loyalists from the American Revolutionary War, the Province of Quebec was divided into two new colonies, consisting of Lower and Upper Canada. The creation of Upper Canada was in response to the influx of United Empire Loyalist settlers, who desired a colonial administration modelled under British institutions and common law, especially British laws of land tenure. Conversely, Lower Canada maintained most of the French Canadian institutions guaranteed under the Quebec Act, such as the French civil law system.\nIn 1838 Lord Durham was sent to the colonies to examine the causes for rebellion in the Canadas. His report on the colonies recommended that the two colonies should be united, and the introduction of responsible government. The British Parliament would eventually act on the former suggestion, with the passage of the \"Act of Union 1840\". The \"Act of Union\" went into force in 1841, and saw the Canadas united into the Province of Canada. However, the Act did not establish responsible government, which was not introduced until 1848.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He was the fourth son of the Hongwu Emperor, the founder of the dynasty.\nIn 1370, Zhu Di was granted the title of Prince of Yan. By 1380, he had relocated to Beijing and was responsible for protecting the northeastern borderlands. In the 1380s and 1390s, he proved himself to be a skilled military leader, gaining popularity among soldiers and achieving success as a statesman. In 1399, he rebelled against his nephew, the Jianwen Emperor, and launched a civil war known as the Jingnan campaign, or the \"campaign to clear away disorders\". After three years of intense fighting, he emerged victorious and declared himself emperor in 1402.\nThe Yongle Emperor's reign is often referred to as the \"second founding\" of the Ming dynasty, as he made significant changes to his father's political policies. Upon ascending the throne, he faced the aftermath of a civil war that had devastated the rural areas of northern China and weakened the economy due to a lack of manpower. In order to stabilize and strengthen the economy, the Emperor first had to suppress any resistance. He purged the state administration of supporters of the Jianwen Emperor as well as corrupt and disloyal officials. The government also took action against secret societies and bandits. To boost the economy, the Emperor promoted food and textile production and utilized uncultivated land, particularly in the prosperous Yangtze Delta region. Additionally, he made the decision to elevate Beijing to a second capital in 1403, reducing the significance of Nanjing. The construction of the new capital, which took place from 1407 to 1420, employed hundreds of thousands of workers daily. At the heart of Beijing was the official Imperial City, with the Forbidden City serving as the palace residence for the Emperor and his family. The Emperor also oversaw the reconstruction of the Grand Canal, which was crucial for supplying the capital and the armies in the north.\nThe Emperor was a strong supporter of both Confucianism and Buddhism. He supported the compilation of the massive \"Yongle Encyclopedia\" by employing two thousand scholars. This encyclopedia surpassed all previous ones, including the \"Four Great Books of Song\" from the 11th century. He also ordered the texts of the Neo-Confucians to be organized and used as textbooks for training future officials. The civil service examinations, held in a three-year cycle, produced qualified graduates who filled positions in the state apparatus. While the Emperor was known for his strict punishments for failures, he was also quick to promote successful servants. Unlike his father, he did not engage in frequent purges. This led to longer tenures for ministers and a more professional and stable state administration. The Emperor primarily ruled \"from horseback\", traveling between the two capitals, similar to the Yuan emperors. He also frequently led military campaigns into Mongolia. However, this behavior was opposed by officials who felt threatened by the growing influence of eunuchs and military elites, who relied on imperial favor for their power.\nThe Emperor also made significant efforts to strengthen and consolidate the empire's hegemonic position in East Asia through foreign policy. Diplomatic messages and military expeditions were sent to \"all four corners of the world\". Missions were sent to countries near and far, including Manchuria, Korea, Japan, the Philippines, and the Timurid Empire in Central Asia. Zheng He's voyages even reached the shores of Southeast Asia, India, Persia, and East Africa. A major threat to the security of the empire was posed by the Mongols, who were divided into three groups\u2014the Uriankhai in the southeast were mostly loyal, while the eastern Mongols and western Oirats were problematic. Ming China alternately supported and opposed them. The Emperor personally led five campaigns into Mongolia, and the decision to move the government from Nanjing to Beijing was motivated by the need to keep a close eye on the restless northern neighbors. \nThe Yongle Emperor was a skilled military leader and placed great emphasis on the strength of his army, but his wars were ultimately unsuccessful. The war in Jiaozhi (present-day northern Vietnam), which began with an invasion in 1407, lasted until the end of his reign. Four years after his death, the Ming army was forced to retreat back to China. Despite his efforts, the campaigns against the Mongols did not significantly alter the balance of power or ensure the security of the northern border.\nEarly years.\nChildhood.\nZhu Di, the future Yongle Emperor, was born on 2 May 1360 as the fourth son of Zhu Yuanzhang. At the time, Zhu Yuanzhang was based in Nanjing and was a prominent leader in the Red Turban Rebellion, an uprising against the Mongol-led Yuan dynasty that controlled China. The rebellion aimed to restore Han Chinese rule after decades of Mongol domination. In the 1360s, Zhu Yuanzhang conquered China, established the Ming dynasty, and declared himself emperor. He is commonly known by his era name as the Hongwu Emperor.\nAfter taking the throne, Zhu Di claimed to be the son of Zhu Yuanzhang's primary wife, Lady Ma, who had been empress since 1368, but other sources suggest that his real mother was a concubine of the Hongwu Emperor with the title Consort Gong, who was either Mongolian (from the Khongirad tribe) or possibly Korean. Zhu Di attempted to present himself as the Hongwu Emperor's legitimate successor by declaring himself and the Hongwu Emperor's fifth son, Zhu Su, as the only sons of Empress Ma in the 1403 edition of the official \"Veritable Records of Emperor Taizu\". This was preposterous, as it was unlikely that a son of the Empress would not be named as successor during the Hongwu Emperor's lifetime. Therefore, in the later version of 1418, all of the Hongwu Emperor's eldest five sons were recognized as her children.\nZhu Di spent his childhood in Nanjing, where he and his siblings were raised with a strong emphasis on discipline and modesty. Out of all his siblings, he had a special fondness for Princess Ningguo, Zhu Fu and Zhu Su. Zhu Su was only 15 months younger than Zhu Di, and they became close friends despite their contrasting personalities. While Zhu Di enjoyed activities such as archery and horseback riding, Zhu Su preferred studying literature and tending to plants.\nThe Hongwu Emperor took great care in the education of his sons, appointing leading scholars of the empire as their tutors. Initially, Song Lian was appointed as the teacher for the heir to the throne, and also gave lectures to the other princes. Song Lian's successor, Kong Keren (), who taught the Emperor's sons philosophy and ethics, had a significant influence on Zhu Di. His favorite subject was the history of the Han dynasty, particularly Emperors Gaozu and Wu of Han, but he often referenced examples from the life of Qin Shi Huang in his decrees as emperor.\nYouth.\nOn 22 April 1370, the Emperor's sons, with the exception of the heir to the throne, were granted princely titles. Zhu Di was given the title of Prince of Yan, with his fief located in Beiping (present-day Beijing). During the Mongol-led Yuan dynasty, Beiping served as the capital of China. After being conquered by the Ming dynasty in 1368, it became a crucial stronghold for the troops guarding the northern border and was also designated as the capital of the province with the same name.\nAt that time, Zhu Di was given his own household, with advisor Hua Yunlong and tutor Gao Xian at its head. Gao Xian spent the next four to five years lecturing him on Confucian classics, history, agriculture, and irrigation. He also trained the prince in poetry and prose writing, and explained the rules of governance and the selection of subordinates. After Hua's death and Gao's dismissal, Fei Yu, Qiu Guang, Wang Wuban, and Zhu Fu took over Zhu Di's education. Despite receiving a comprehensive education from esteemed teachers, Zhu Di's true passion always lay in military pursuits rather than scholarly pursuits and palace discussions.\nIn early 1376, Zhu Di married Lady Xu, the daughter of Xu Da, who was ranked first among all of the early Ming generals. She was two years younger than him. Lady Xu was known for her intelligence, decisiveness, and energy. Their first son, Zhu Gaochi, was born on 16 August 1378. The couple had two more sons, Zhu Gaoxu and Zhu Gaosui.\nA few weeks after his wedding, Zhu Di traveled to Fengyang (then known as Zhongdu\u2014the Central Capital) where he underwent seven months of military training alongside his elder brothers Zhu Shuang and Zhu Gang. Two years later, he returned to Fengyang with his younger brothers Zhu Su, Zhu Zhen and Zhu Fu, and stayed for an additional two years. During this time, he not only trained in command and combat, but also gained knowledge in logistics and the acquisition and transportation of materials and supplies for warfare. It was during this period that his organizational skills began to emerge, which he later utilized effectively in his battles. He also took the opportunity to disguise himself as a regular soldier and immerse himself in the lives of ordinary people. Looking back, he considered his time in Fengyang to be the happiest days of his life.\nIn 1376, Li Wenzhong, the nephew and adopted son of the Hongwu Emperor, who was responsible for defending the north, was given the responsibility of preparing Zhu Di's palace in Beiping. He utilized the former palaces of the Yuan emperors, providing Zhu Di with a larger and more fortified residence compared to his brothers, some of whom resided in converted temples or county offices. General Li also focused on fortifying the city, a decision that would have consequences during the civil war when his son, Li Jinglong, unsuccessfully attempted to besiege Beiping in 1399.\nPrince of Yan in Beiping.\nIn April 1380, at the age of twenty, Zhu Di moved to Beiping. He encountered a strong Mongolian influence, which the government tried to suppress by banning Mongolian customs, clothing, and names. The city had recovered from the famine and wars of the 1350s and 1360s and was experiencing growth. Along with the hundreds of thousands of soldiers stationed in the region, the city was also home to officials administering the province, as well as artisans and laborers from all over the country. The main concern of the local authorities was providing enough food for the population. Peasants were relocated to the north, soldiers and convicts were sent to cultivate the land, and merchants were granted licenses to trade salt in exchange for bringing grain to the region. The government also transported food supplies to the city.\nZhu Di's interest in the military was put into practice when he personally trained his own guard. He used his detachments as a means of balancing the power of the provincial commander, who was unable to mobilize troops without authorization from the Emperor and approval from the prince. Meanwhile, Zhu Di had the freedom to train and deploy his own guard. In 1381, he had his first experience in the field when he joined his father-in-law Xu Da's campaign against the Mongols, led by Nayur Buqa.\nIn the 1380s, Zhu Di served in border defense under the leadership of Xu Da. After Xu Da died in 1385, his deputy Fu Youde took over leadership. In 1387, Zhu Di participated in a successful attack on the Mongols in Liaodong, led by Feng Sheng. The following year, a Ming army led by Lan Yu made a foray into eastern Mongolia and defeated the Mongol khan T\u00f6g\u00fcs Tem\u00fcr, capturing many prisoners and horses, but both generals were accused of mistreating captives and misappropriating booty, which the prince reported to the Emperor.\nIn January 1390, the Emperor entrusted his sons with independent command for the first time. He gave the princes of Jin (Zhu Gang), Yan (Zhu Di), and Qi (Zhu Fu) the task of leading a punitive expedition against the Mongol commanders Nayur Buqa and Alu Tem\u00fcr, who were threatening Shanxi and Gansu. Zhu Di demonstrated excellent command skills when he defeated and captured both Mongol commanders in battle. They then served under him with their troops. The Emperor appreciated Zhu Di's success, which contrasted with the hesitancy of Zhu Gang. Zhu Di continued to lead armies into battle against the Mongols repeatedly and with great success.\nIn 1392, the Emperor's eldest son and heir to the throne, Zhu Biao, died, and the court then discussed who would succeed Zhu Biao. The primogeniture viewpoint advocated by scholars from the Hanlin Academy and high officials prevailed, and the Emperor appointed Zhu Biao's son, Zhu Yunwen, as the new successor. Generals Feng Sheng, Fu Youde, and Lan Yu (who were related to the successor by blood) were chosen as his tutors and teachers, but due to a recommendation from Zhu Di, the Hongwu Emperor began to suspect the three generals of treason. Zhu Di did not have a good relationship with Lan Yu, and according to historian Wang Shizhen (; 1526\u20131590), he was responsible for Lan's execution in March 1393. The other two generals also died under unclear circumstances at the turn of 1394 and 1395. In their place, princes were appointed. For example, in 1393, Zhu Gang was given command of all the troops in Shanxi province, and Zhu Di was given command in Beiping province. Additionally, Zhu Shuang, Prince of Qin, was in charge of Shaanxi, but he died in 1395.\nThe Hongwu Emperor, who was deeply affected by the death of his two eldest sons and the strained relations between his remaining sons and his heir, made the decision to revise the rules governing the imperial family for the fourth time. The new edition significantly limited the rights of the princes. These changes had little impact on Zhu Di's status as they did not affect his main area of expertise\u2014the military. Furthermore, Zhu Di was cautious not to give any reason for criticism. For example, he did not object to the execution of his generals Nayur Buqa and Alu Tem\u00fcr, who were accused of treason. He also exercised caution in diplomatic relations, such as when he welcomed Korean delegations passing through Beiping, to avoid any indication of disrespect towards the Emperor's authority.\nOut of the six princes responsible for guarding the northern border, Zhu Di was the second oldest but also the most capable. He had operated in a vast territory, stretching from Liaodong to the bend of the Yellow River. He was not afraid to take risks, as demonstrated by his defeat of the Mongols led by Polin Tem\u00fcr at Daning in the summer of 1396. He also went on a raid with his brother Zhu Gang several hundred kilometers north of the Great Wall, which earned them a sharp reprimand from their father. In April 1398, Zhu Gang died, leaving Zhu Di as the undisputed leader of the northern border defense. Two months later, Zhu Di's father also died.\nRise to power.\nConflict with the Jianwen Emperor.\nAfter the death of the Hongwu Emperor, Zhu Yunwen ascended the throne as the Jianwen Emperor. His closest advisors immediately began reviewing the Hongwu Emperor's reforms, with the most significant change being an attempt to limit and eventually eliminate the princes who were the sons of the Hongwu Emperor and controlled a significant portion of the empire's military power. The government employed various methods to remove five of the princes, including exile, house arrest, and even driving them to suicide.\nZhu Di was considered the most dangerous of all the princes. As an experienced military leader and the oldest surviving son of the Hongwu Emperor, he posed a significant threat to the government. As a result, they treated him with caution and limited his power. They replaced military commanders in the northeast with generals loyal to the Jianwen Emperor and transferred 15,000 men under Zhu Di's command outside of Beiping. Despite this, Zhu Di managed to convince the Emperor of his loyalty. He even asked for mercy for his brother Zhu Su and begged for permission to have his sons, who had been staying in Nanjing since the funeral of the Hongwu Emperor, returned to him. The government had been holding them as hostages as a precautionary measure. In June 1399, the Emperor's advisor, Huang Zicheng, convinced him that releasing Zhu Di's sons would help to ease tensions.\nIn early August 1399, Zhu Di used the arrest of two of his officials as a pretext for rebellion. He claimed that he was rising up to protect the Emperor from the corrupt court officials. With the support of Beijing dignitaries, he gained control of the city's garrison and occupied the surrounding prefectures and counties. He attempted to justify his actions through letters sent to the court in August and December 1399, as well as through a public statement.\nIn his letters and statements, Zhu Di repeatedly asserted that he had no desire for the throne, but as the eldest living son of the deceased emperor, he felt a duty to restore the laws and order that had been dismantled by the new government. He explained that this was out of respect for his late father. He also accused the current emperor and his advisors of withholding information about his father's illness and preventing him from attending the funeral. Furthermore, he condemned their unjust treatment of the Emperor's uncles, who were his own younger brothers. He justified his actions as necessary self-defense, not against the Emperor himself, but against his corrupt ministers. He referred to these actions as the Jingnan campaign, a campaign to clear away disorders.\nCivil war.\nAt the start of the war, Zhu Di commanded a force of 100,000 soldiers and only held control over the immediate area surrounding Beiping. Despite the Nanjing government's larger number of armies and greater material resources, Zhu Di's soldiers were of higher quality and he possessed a strong Mongol cavalry. Most importantly, his military leadership skills were superior to the indecisiveness and lack of coordination displayed by the government's generals.\nIn September 1399, a government army of 130,000 soldiers, led by the experienced veteran general Geng Bingwen, marched towards Zhending, a city located southwest of Beiping, but by the end of the month, they were defeated. In response, the court appointed a new commander, Li Jinglong, who then led a new army to besiege Beiping on 12 November. Zhu Di, who had been gathering troops in the northeast, swiftly returned and defeated the surprised Li army. The soldiers from the south, who were not accustomed to the cold weather, were forced to retreat to Dezhou in Shandong.\nIn 1400, Zhu Di's army fought in the southern part of Beiping province and northwestern Shandong, with varying levels of success. In the spring, he led a successful attack into Datong, defeating Li Jinglong near Baoding in May and outside Dezhou in June, but due to concerns about potential enemy reinforcements, Zhu Di ended the siege of Jinan in September and retreated to Beiping. Li Jinglong's lackluster performance led the government to appoint Sheng Yong as the new commander of the counterinsurgency army.\nIn 1401, Zhu Di attempted to weaken the enemy by attacking smaller units, which disrupted the supply of government troops. Both sides then focused on breaking through along the Grand Canal. In January, Zhu Di suffered a defeat at Dongchang, but in April he was victorious at Jia River. The front continued to move back and forth for the rest of the year.\nIn 1402, instead of launching another attack along the Grand Canal, Zhu Di advanced further west and bypassed Dezhou. He then conquered Xuzhou in early March. The government troops retreated south to Zhili and were repeatedly defeated. In July, the rebels reached the north bank of the Yangtze River. The commander of the government fleet defected to Zhu Di's side, allowing the rebel army to cross the river without resistance and advance on Nanjing. Due to the betrayal of Li Jinglong and Zhu Hui, Zhu Di's younger brother, the capital city was captured on 13 July 1402, with little resistance. During the clashes, the palace was set on fire, resulting in the deaths of the Emperor, his empress, and his son.\nAccession to the throne.\nOn 17 July 1402, Zhu Di ascended the throne, officially succeeding his father. Even as late as the summer of 1402, the new emperor was still dealing with the Jianwen Emperor's followers, who denied the legitimacy of Zhu Di's rule. He responded by erasing the Jianwen Emperor's reign from history. This included abolishing the Jianwen era and extending the Hongwu era until the end of 1402. He then adopted Yongle (\"perpetual happiness\") as his own era name. He abolished the reforms and laws implemented by the Jianwen government, restored the titles and privileges of the princes, and destroyed government archives (with the exception of financial and military records). He also attempted to involve respected supporters of the Jianwen Emperor, such as Fang Xiaoru and Liu Jing (), in his administration, but they refused and were subsequently executed. Similarly, officials Huang Zicheng and Qi Tai were executed, along with their family members, teachers, students, and followers. Many others were imprisoned or deported to the border, resulting in a purge that affected tens of thousands of people.\nAfter the Yongle Emperor ascended to the imperial throne, the \"Veritable Records of Emperor Taizu\" were rewritten. The original version, created in 1402 at the court of the Jianwen Emperor, was deemed unacceptable by the new regime. In late 1402, the authors of the original version began to revise their work, completing it in July 1403, but the Emperor was dissatisfied with the revised version and in 1411, he ordered a new version to be prepared. This new version was completed in June 1418, and changes focused primarily on his claim to the throne. It included claims that he was the son of Empress Ma, that the Hongwu Emperor had considered appointing him as successor, that he was to be the regent of the Jianwen Emperor, and that he was an exceptionally talented military leader who was highly favored by his father.\nAdministration.\nIn contrast to the frequent changes in offices during the Hongwu Emperor's reign, the high levels of the Yongle Emperor's administration remained stable. While the Emperor did occasionally imprison ministers, the mass purges seen in the Hongwu era did not occur again. Eunuchs and generals oversaw the most significant political matters, while officials were responsible for managing finances, the judiciary, and routine tasks. As a result, the atomization of administration that was characteristic of the Hongwu Emperor's rule diminished, allowing the Emperor to focus less on routine details.\nThe political influence of the bureaucratic apparatus gradually increased, and under the Yongle Emperor's rule, ministers were able to challenge the Emperor, even at the cost of their freedom or lives. The most significant change was the emergence of the Grand Secretariat, which played a crucial role in the politics of the Yongle Emperor's successors. Led by the grand secretaries, officials gained control of the government.\nPrinces and generals.\nThe Emperor restored the titles of the princes of Zhou, Qi, and Min, which had been abolished by the Jianwen Emperor, but these titles did not come with the same power and authority as before. During the latter half of his reign, the Yongle Emperor accused many of these princes of committing crimes and punished them by removing their personal guards. He had previously condemned the same actions when they were carried out by the Jianwen Emperor. In order to reduce political threats, the Yongle Emperor relocated several border princes from the north to central and southern China. By the end of his reign, the princes had lost much of their political influence.\nOne of the Yongle Emperor's first actions upon assuming the throne was to reorganize the military command. He promoted loyal generals and granted them titles and ranks. In October 1402, he appointed two dukes (\"gong\"; )\u2014Qiu Fu and Zhu Neng (), thirteen marquises (\"hou\"; ), and nine counts (\"bo\"; ). Among these appointments were one duke and three counts from the dignitaries who had defected to his side before the fall of Nanjing\u2014Li Jinglong, Chen Xuan (), Ru Chang (), and Wang Zuo (). In June 1403, an additional nine generals from the civil war were appointed as marquises or counts. In the following years, meritorious military leaders from the campaign against the Mongols were also granted titles of dukes, marquises, and counts, including those of Mongolian origin.\nThe Emperor established a new hereditary military nobility. While their income from the state treasury (2200\u20132500 \"dan\" of grain for dukes, 1500\u2013800 for marquises, and 1000 for counts; with 1 \"dan\" being equivalent to 107 liters) was not particularly high, the prestige associated with their titles was more significant. They commanded armies in the Emperor's name, without competition from the princes who had been stripped of their influence. The nobility also held immunity from punishment by local authorities, but there were notable differences from the Hongwu era. During that time, the generals, who were former comrades-in-arms of the Emperor, held a higher status, had their own followers, and wielded considerable power in their assigned areas. This eventually posed a threat to the Emperor, leading to their elimination. Under the Yongle Emperor, members of the nobility did not participate in regional or civil administration, nor were they assigned permanent military units. Instead, they were given \"ad hoc\" assembled armies. Additionally, the Emperor often personally led campaigns accompanied by the nobility, strengthening their personal relationships. As a result, the military nobility was closely tied to the Emperor and remained loyal. There was no need for purges, and any isolated cases of punishment were due to the failures and shortcomings of those involved. Overall, the nobility elevated the Emperor's prestige and contributed to the military successes of his reign.\nOfficials and authorities.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThe grand secretaries during the reign of the Yongle Emperor, from 1402 to 1424. The first two were appointed in August and September 1402, while the rest were appointed shortly thereafter.\nThe Grand Secretariat was headed by Huang Huai briefly in 1402, followed by Xie Jin, and then by Hu Guang from 1407 until his death in 1418. Yang Rong then took over until the end of the Yongle Emperor's reign.\nThe Emperor reorganized the civilian administration, gaining the support of officials who had often served under the previous government. He restored the administrative structure of the Hongwu era, while also making some changes. First and foremost, in 1402, the Grand Secretariat was created to act as an intermediary between the Emperor and the government, partially replacing the Central Secretariat that had been abolished in 1380. Despite their informal position, the grand secretaries quickly gained dominance in the civil administration.\nThe Grand Secretariat was established in August 1402, when the Emperor began to address current administrative issues during a working dinner with Huang Huai and Xie Jin after the evening audience. In September 1402, he appointed five additional grand secretaries. These grand secretaries were all from the south or southeast and were highly educated and skilled in administration, having previously served in lower positions in the Jianwen administration. Despite their relatively low status (at most fifth rank), they were given high titles in the household of the heir apparent. Over time, they evolved from subordinate assistants responsible for organizing correspondence and formulating responses to becoming influential politicians who proposed solutions to problems. Their close proximity to the Emperor gave them an advantage over the ministers. The Emperor kept his grand secretaries with him, and some even accompanied him on his Mongol campaigns. During this period, the empire was governed by the heir to the throne with the assistance of other grand secretaries and selected ministers. The heir developed a close relationship with the grand secretaries and became the \"de facto\" representative of the officials.\nThe Yongle Emperor was meticulous in his selection of the top officials for the state apparatus, including the members of the Grand Secretariat and the ministers. He placed particular trust in those who had served him during the civil war, such as Jin Zhong (), Guo Zi, L\u00fc Zhen (), and Wu Zhong (). These ministers came from all over China, but were all highly educated and capable administrators. Among them, Minister of Revenue Xia Yuanji was the most trusted by the Emperor. Xia advocated for moderation in spending and using resources for the benefit of the population, which earned him the Emperor's respect for his honesty and transparency. Xia held this position for nineteen years until 1421, when he, along with Minister of Justice Wu Zhong and Minister of War Fang Bin, protested against the costly campaign into Mongolia. Despite their objections, the Emperor ultimately prevailed and Fang committed suicide, while Wu and Xia were imprisoned. After the Yongle Emperor's death, they were exonerated and returned to their positions of authority. Other long-serving ministers overseeing various ministries included Jian Yi (), Song Li (), and Liu Quan ().\nThroughout most of the Yongle Emperor's reign, the leadership of four out of the Six Ministries (Personnel, Revenue, Rites, and Works) showed remarkable stability, with the same individual ministers typically heading each respective office for extended periods. Continuity in the highest offices persisted even after the Emperor's death, as many ministers continued to serve in their positions.\nThe regular cycle of civil service examinations also contributed to the improvement and stabilization of administration at lower levels. In the second decade of the Yongle Emperor's reign, the examinations were held every three years. A total of 1,833 individuals passed the examinations in the capital, and the majority of these graduates were appointed to government positions. The Imperial University, which was previously responsible for selecting officials, lost its significance and became a place for candidates to study for the palace examinations. By the end of the Yongle Emperor's reign, the Ministry of Personnel had a sufficient number of examination graduates to fill important positions at the county level and above. Overall, the administration became more qualified and stable.\nEunuchs.\nThe Yongle Emperor relied heavily on eunuchs, more so than his father did. He even recruited eunuchs from the Jianwen era, with whom he had been associated during the civil war. These eunuchs came from various backgrounds, including Mongolian, Central Asian, Jurchen, and Korean. In addition to their duties within the Forbidden City, the Yongle Emperor trusted their unwavering loyalty and often assigned them tasks outside the palace's walls, such as surveillance and intelligence gathering.\nEunuchs also held positions of military command and led diplomatic missions, but their role as the Emperor's secret agents, responsible for monitoring both civilian and military officials, was well-known but also unpopular and feared. While they were known for exposing corrupt officials, they also had a reputation for abusing their power and succumbing to corruption themselves. In 1420, a special investigation office was established, informally known as the \"Eastern Depot\" due to its location in the palace. This office was responsible for overseeing the judiciary, but it became infamous for its role in the disappearance of individuals. Stories of innocent imprisonment, torture, and unexplained deaths involving the office circulated until the end of the dynasty.\nSuccession disputes.\nThe Yongle Emperor had four sons, the first three by Empress Xu, while the fourth, Zhu Gaoxi, died in infancy. The eldest son, Zhu Gaochi, was not physically fit and instead of warfare, he focused on literature and poetry. The second son, Zhu Gaoxu, was tall and strong, a successful warrior, but the third son, Zhu Gaosui, was mediocre in character and ability.\nMany influential officials, including General Qiu Fu, suggested that Zhu Gaoxu should be the heir to the throne. They argued for his prowess and military skills, citing his past actions of saving his father from danger and turning the tide of battles during the civil war. Grand Secretary Xie Jin disagreed and argued that the people would admire Zhu Gaochi for his humanity. He also reminded the Emperor of the future accession of Zhu Zhanji, the Emperor's favorite grandson and Zhu Gaochi's eldest son. Ultimately, the Emperor designated Zhu Gaochi as heir to the throne on 9 May 1404, and appointed Qiu Fu as his tutor the following day.\nAt the same time, the Emperor appointed Zhu Gaoxu as the Prince of Han and entrusted him with control of Yunnan. Zhu Gaosui became the Prince of Zhao, based in Beijing. Zhu Gaoxu refused to go to Yunnan, and his father gave in to his wishes, which allowed him to provoke conflicts with his older brother. In the spring of 1407, Zhu Gaoxu succeeded in slandering Xie Jin, who was accused of showing favoritism towards Jiangxi natives in the examinations. As a result, Xie was transferred to the province and later imprisoned. In 1414, Grand Secretaries Huang Huai and Yang Shiqi were accused of not observing proper court ceremony, and both were imprisoned for their support of the Heir Apparent. Yang was soon released, but Huang remained in prison until the end of the Yongle era. In 1416, Zhu Gaoxu was given a new fief in Qingzhou Prefecture in Shandong. Once again, he refused to leave, which led his father to reprimand him. He then began to raise his own army and even had an army officer killed. As a result, his father stripped him of his titles, demoted him to a common subject, and later imprisoned him. The following year, he was deported to Shandong.\nMilitary.\nDuring the Yongle Emperor's reign, the military underwent significant changes. He implemented four major reforms, including the abolition of the princely guards (\"huwei\"; ), the relocation of the majority of the capital guards (\"jingwei\"; ) from Nanjing to Beijing, the establishment of the capital training camps (\"jingying\"; ), and the reorganization of the defenses along the northern border.\nThe Emperor reorganized the Embroidered Uniform Guard (\"Jinyiwei\"), which was responsible for carrying out secret police duties. Its main focus was handling politically sensitive cases, such as investigating members of the imperial family, but there were instances of corruption and abuse of power within the organization, most notably the case of Ji Gang (). Ji Gang, who had been the Emperor's favorite during the civil war, was eventually accused of plotting against the throne and executed in 1416. By 1420, the Embroidered Uniform Guard had been overshadowed by the Eastern Depot, which also conducted investigations on its officers.\nThe abolition of the princes' armies was a logical decision. The Yongle Emperor's military strength as the Prince of Yan played a crucial role in his rise to the throne, and he was determined to prevent history from repeating itself. The existing princely guards were mostly integrated into the regular army, and although the Yongle Emperor's sons had played an active and successful role in the civil war, they were not given command of the armies after it ended. Instead, the Emperor himself or dependable generals led campaigns.\nOne significant and permanent step taken during this time was the relocation of a large portion of the army to the Beijing area. As the capital moved to Beijing, the majority of the 41 guard units of the Nanjing garrison also made the move. Among the troops stationed in Beijing were 22 guard units of the Imperial Guard (\"qinjun\"; ), totaling 190,800 men. This included the original three guard units of Zhu Di's princely guard. Overall, approximately 25\u201330% of the Ming army (74 guard units in the mid-1430s) was now concentrated in and around Beijing, with a total strength of over two million men under the Yongle Emperor's reign. As a result, soldiers and their families made up a significant portion of the population in the Beijing area. To oversee the remaining guard units in and around Nanjing, a military commander position was established, often filled by eunuchs.\nAfter the second campaign in Mongolia, the Emperor made the decision to enhance the training of his soldiers. He established the capital training camps, known as the Three Great Camps (\"Sandaying\"), in the vicinity of Beijing. In 1415, he issued a decree requiring all guards in the northern provinces and the southern metropolitan area to send a portion of their troops to these camps for training. The camps were specifically designed for the training of infantry, cavalry, and units equipped with firearms. Each camp was under the leadership of a eunuch and two generals. The Emperor placed great emphasis on the importance of cavalry in successful combat in the steppe. As a result, the number of horses in the army significantly increased from 37,993 in 1403 to 1,585,322 in 1423.\nAt the beginning of the Yongle Emperor's reign, the defense system on the northern border was reorganized. Under the Hongwu Emperor, the defense of the north was organized in two lines. The first, the outer line, consisted of eight garrisons located in the steppe close to the border. These garrisons served as bases for forays into Mongolian territory. The second line of defense was along the later Great Wall. This strategic placement allowed for the prevention of Mongol raids even in the steppe. In the Yongle era, the outer line was abandoned with the exception of the garrison in Kaiping. The Emperor then resettled loyal Uriankhai Mongols on the vacated territory.\nThe border troops along the northern borders were placed under the authority of nine newly established border regional commands. These commands were under the control of provincial military commanders (\"zongbing guan\"; ) and were located in Liaodong, Jizhou, Xuanfu, Datong, Shanxi, Yansui, Guyuan (in Shaanxi), Ningxia, and Gansu. Unlike in the Hongwu era, the soldiers stationed on the border were not from nearby guards, but were instead from the three capital training camps. The commanders of these areas were chosen from officers of the inland garrisons or higher commands. By the end of the Yongle era, there were 863,000 soldiers stationed in garrisons along the northern border.\nThe withdrawal to the Great Wall was a significant decline in security, as evidenced by later Ming officials debating the occupation of Ordos. The main fortress of the inner line, Xuanfu, was vulnerable to Mongol attacks after the withdrawal. Under the Yongle Emperor, however, the negative effects of the withdrawal were overshadowed by Ming power and strength. After his death, the Chinese did not make any attempts to reclaim the steppe for the rest of the Ming dynasty.\nThe navy was not a separate branch of the army; only the coastal guards had ships. By 1420, there were approximately 1,350 small patrol ships and an equal number of large warships scattered among the coastal garrisons. The Nanjing fleet consisted of 400 warships, 400 cargo ships manned by soldiers from Nanjing garrison guards, who were trained for naval combat (four of the ten Nanjing guards had \"naval\" names), and 250 treasure ships and other ships used for long-distance voyages.\nEconomy.\nPopulation, agriculture, and crafts.\nAround 1400, the Ming dynasty had a population of 90 million. During the early 15th century, the weather was more stable and warmer compared to before and after. This favorable climate allowed for rich harvests, making agriculture the foundation of the country's prosperity. Although there were occasional local disasters such as epidemics or floods, they did not significantly alter the overall situation. The government provided assistance to affected regions from state reserves.\nThe Yongle Emperor recognized that the most effective way to ensure his own rule and that of his descendants was by supporting the peasants. For example, in 1403, when the crops were destroyed by a locust invasion in Henan, he took the initiative to organize relief efforts for the affected population. He also punished negligent officials and rejected the suggestion of Minister of Revenue Yu Xin () to punish officials who were unable to collect taxes in full. The Emperor argued that the root of the problem was the natural disaster, not the officials. In 1404, when he was informed of the increase in silk production in Shandong, he responded that he would not be satisfied until there was enough food and clothing for everyone in the empire, ensuring that no one suffered from hunger or cold.\nThe northern provinces were impoverished and unproductive, and their local army and administration had become reliant on importing rice from the south during the Hongwu era. The relocation of the capital to Beijing resulted in an increase in the number of soldiers, officials, artisans, and laborers, exacerbating the issue. In response, the government attempted to resettle people from the densely populated south to the north, but the southerners struggled to adapt to the harsh northern climate and many returned to their homes. By 1416, the government had abandoned this forced resettlement policy and instead implemented a strategy of supporting local development. As part of this, the government began selling salt trading licenses to merchants in exchange for rice deliveries to the north. On the other hand, the influx of impoverished immigrants from other parts of north China resulted in an increase in cultivated land and the production of agricultural and textile goods. This also led to the establishment of foundries in Zunhua, located in Hebei.\nFinance and currency.\nThe Yongle Emperor was less frugal than his father, as his reign saw significant spending on foreign expansion (such as wars in Jiaozhi and Mongolia, and naval voyages) and internal politics (such as the construction of a new capital and the restoration of the Grand Canal). This resulted in a significant increase in state spending, which doubled or even tripled compared to the Hongwu era, but the exact size of this spending is difficult to determine as there was no official state budget and each source of income was allocated to cover specific expenses. The government attempted to generate revenue by issuing paper money and demanding more grain from hereditary soldiers, but these measures were not enough to solve the fiscal problems. In some areas, taxes were even reduced, but the state still managed to meet its needs through requisitions and an increase in the work obligation. As a result of these financial challenges, the state's reserves, which were typically equivalent to one year's income during the Ming period, reached a record low under the Yongle Emperor's rule.\nThe economic growth was supported by the government's expansion of precious metal mining, particularly copper and silver, in southern China and Jiaozhi. The government also increased the emission of paper money (banknotes, \"baochao\"). Revenues from silver mining, which previously accounted for only 30% of output, rose significantly from 1.1 tons in 1390 to over 10 tons in 1409, and remained at this level for the rest of the Yongle Emperor's reign. The government also produced coins from the mined copper, which were stored in state treasuries and given as gifts to foreign embassies, but these coins continued to circulate on the domestic market alongside the \"baochao\", in contrast to the Xuande and Zhengtong eras (1425\u20131447) when they were removed from circulation under government pressure.\nLike his father, the Yongle Emperor believed that banknotes were the foundation of currency. In order to cover the deficit caused by expensive foreign policies and the relocation of the capital, he printed large volumes of these banknotes, but this excessive printing led to inflation, the most severe in the Ming period. By 1425, paper money was only worth 2% of its nominal value, causing the population to reject it. In an attempt to encourage its circulation, the government required fees to be paid with these banknotes, but this had little impact. Additionally, the repeated bans on the use of silver in commercial transactions (in 1403, 1404, 1419, and 1425) were also unsuccessful.\nOfficials and title holders were no longer solely compensated with grain, as the Hongwu Emperor's rules had originally intended. Instead, senior officials received only 60% of their salary in grain, while lower officials received a mere 20%. The remaining portion was paid in bills and coins. However, this method of payment using devalued banknotes resulted in a significant decrease in the already low salaries of these officials. As a result, many officials and officers resorted to seeking illegal sources of income.\nThe Yongle Emperor, in particular, sought to increase income from military farms (\"juntun\"; ), but the northern borderlands, home to most of the military units, were largely barren. In order to make up for the lack of resources, officers resorted to becoming landowners and using the labor of their soldiers, leading to desertion among the ranks. Despite the government's efforts to control and increase production, the hereditary soldiers consistently delivered less each year. For example, their production dropped from 23 million \"dan\" of grain in 1403 to 14 million in 1407 and eventually to 5 million in 1423.\nTaxation and levies.\nUnder the Yongle Emperor's reign, the amount of land tax collected was significantly higher than in previous decades, with a yield of 31\u201334 million \"dan\" of grain. In comparison, the land tax in 1393 was only 29.4 million \"dan\". The actual burden of the tax was also influenced by transportation costs and additional fees that were collected to cover them. In some cases, the tax was not collected in grain, but rather in silk and other commodities, based on calculations determined by the state. These calculations often did not reflect the current market prices, resulting in the tax being increased multiple times.\nThe taxation in Jiangnan remained exceptionally high, with Suzhou and Songjiang prefectures supplying 14% of the empire's land taxes. The residents of Jiangnan were not able to pay these high taxes, leading to a significant amount of arrears in the early 1430s. For example, Suzhou Prefecture alone had 8 million \"dan\" of grain in arrears. In response to this issue, the Xuande Emperor eventually reduced their taxes.\nPart of the materials and labor required for government construction projects were purchased using surpluses collected in state granaries, but these purchases were made at prices set by the state, which were lower than market prices. As a result, the increased demands of the state had a significant impact on the population, primarily through the implementation of more and more extraordinary levies and the growth of compulsory work for the state. For example, the work duty of artisans, which was typically 30 days a year, was often extended for periods longer than a year. Additionally, the cost of importing rice to Beijing fell on the peasants of the Yangtze River Delta. These taxpayers were responsible for supplying rice to southern port cities, from where it was then transported north by the army. To cover these costs, a tax surcharge was imposed, which had to be paid in money. Both the sea route to the north and the inland route were expensive and inefficient, but the opening of the Grand Canal in 1415 greatly improved transportation conditions. By 1418, taxpayers themselves were responsible for transporting rice all the way to Beijing. In 1431, the government relieved them of this duty and soldiers once again began to transport grain along the Grand Canal.\nIn an effort to reduce the government's demands on its subjects and limit government spending, the Yongle Emperor's successors implemented reforms. Despite these efforts, maintaining a large army and supplying Beijing continued to be a difficult task.\nConstruction projects.\nNew capital city.\nThe Yongle Emperor's most significant accomplishment was the relocation of the capital to Beijing. The idea of moving the capital from Nanjing (then known as Yingtian) to the north was first considered by the Hongwu Emperor in the early 1390s. Despite Nanjing's proximity to the empire's economic center in the Yangtze Delta, both the Hongwu and Yongle emperors faced the challenge of governing from a great distance from the empire's northern and western borders, which required a significant amount of attention. Additionally, as a foreigner in Nanjng, the Yongle Emperor likely felt more at home in Beijng, which served as his political base. Beijing was strategically located on the northern border, accessible by the Grand Canal and in close proximity to the sea, making it a convenient location for supplies. Its history as the capital of the Liao, Jin, and Yuan dynasties also added to its significance.\nThe relocation of the capital was a highly challenging undertaking that demanded a significant mobilization of both people and resources from all corners of the country to be transferred to the outskirts of the empire. The Emperor initiated the move of the capital in February 1403 by elevating Beijing to a secondary capital and renaming it from Beiping (Pacified North) to Shuntian (Obedient to Heaven), but it was still commonly referred to as Beijing (Northern Capital). He appointed his eldest son, Zhu Gaochi, to administer the city and province, and established branches of ministries and chief military commissions in Beijing. In 1404, he relocated 10,000 families from Shanxi to the city and exempted it and the surrounding area from taxes for two years. The following year, over 120,000 landless households from the Yangtze Delta were relocated to the north, and construction of government buildings began. The government also began felling trees in the forests of Jiangxi, Huguang, Zhejiang, Shanxi, and Sichuan to provide wood for the palaces in Beijing. Artisans and laborers were sent from all over the country, but the work was slowed by supply issues.\nIn March 1409, the Emperor arrived in the north for the first time in seven years, following the end of the first Mongol campaign, but upon his arrival in Nanjing the following year, officials protested the excessive spending on construction in Beijing. As a result, spending was reduced and the pace of construction slowed for several years.\nFrom 1414 to the end of 1416, the Emperor remained in Beijing during the campaign in Mongolia. The reconstruction of the Grand Canal was completed in 1415, which greatly aided in the supply of the north. Construction then resumed at a faster pace. The exact number of workers involved in building the city is unknown, but it is estimated to have been several hundred thousand. The chief architects and engineers include Cai Xin (), Nguy\u1ec5n An (a Viet eunuch), Kuai Xiang and Lu Xiang (). By the end of 1417, most of the palaces were completed, but construction on the walls continued. In 1420, the city was deemed ready for the relocation of the government. On 28 October 1420, Beijing was officially declared the principal capital of the empire, and by February 1421, ministries and other government agencies had relocated to Beijing.\nIn 1421, a famine broke out in the northern provinces. At the same time, three major audience halls in the newly built Forbidden City were destroyed by fire. This event shook the Emperor, who saw it as a sign of displeasure from Heaven. In response, he called upon government officials to critique the mistakes of the government. One of the officials, a junior secretary named Xiao Yi, strongly criticized the decision to build the capital in the north and was subsequently executed. This effectively silenced any further discussion on the matter.\nThe empire was administered by the Beijing authorities from 1421, although some ministries remained in Nanjing, but their powers were limited to the southern metropolitan area and held little political significance. The cost of supplying Beijing, which was located far from the economically developed regions of the country, was a constant burden on the state treasury.\nGrand Canal.\nDuring the centuries leading up to the Yongle Emperor's reign, the Grand Canal was neglected and partially disappeared. In the early years of the Yongle Emperor's rule, there were two routes for transporting rice to Beijing to feed the city's inhabitants and northern troops. The first route began at Liujiagang in the Yangtze Delta and went through the East China Sea to Tianjin, but this route was risky due to weather and pirates. The second route, which went through the rivers and canals of Anhui, Shandong, and Hubei, was problematic because cargo had to be transferred multiple times. Every year, 480,000 to 800,000 \"dan\" of rice were transported by sea, and even more was transported by inland waterways, with a total of 2 to 2.5 million \"dan\" delivered to the north in 1410\u20131414. This slow and difficult transportation of rice put a heavy burden on the population. Local officials in Shandong petitioned the Emperor to improve transportation by restoring a continuous waterway from south to north, and the Emperor approved. The government then sent 165,000 workers to reconstruct the waterway, and they built a system of fifteen locks in western Shandong. After the reconstruction was completed in 1415, transportation became faster and cheaper. In 1417 and 1418, the amount of rice shipped increased to 5 and 4.7 million \"dan\", respectively, due to the Emperor's projects, before falling again to 2\u20133 million per year. The transportation was provided by 160,000 soldiers with 15,000 ships, and maintenance was carried out by 47,000 workers. The opening of the Grand Canal led to the economic growth of the regions it passed through. It also resulted in the end of sea transportation of rice to the north, which caused a decline in naval shipbuilding.\nThe reopening of the Grand Canal had a positive impact on Suzhou. Its strategic location in the middle of the canal network south of the Yangtze (which was reconstructed after 1403) allowed the city to regain its status as a major commercial hub and experience a return to prosperity after being deprived of it during the reign of the Hongwu Emperor. Meanwhile, Nanjing's political and economic influence declined, relegating it to a regional center, but it remained the foremost cultural center of the empire.\nOther projects.\nThe Yongle Emperor completed the Xiao Mausoleum, where his father was buried. A grand Sifangcheng pavilion was constructed, featuring an eight-meter stele carried by a bixi turtle. The stele bore an inscription honoring the virtues and accomplishments of the Hongwu Emperor. Originally planned to be 73 meters tall, the stele was ultimately left unfinished at the Yangshan Quarry due to difficulties in transportation and erection.\nWhen the capital was relocated to Beijing, the Yongle Emperor also decided to establish new dynastic burial grounds. After consulting with feng shui experts, a site was chosen on the southern slopes of the Tianshou Mountains, approximately 50 km north of downtown Beijing. This became the final resting place for the Yongle Emperor and his twelve successors.\nIn Huguang, the Yongle Emperor undertook a large-scale construction project, employing twenty thousand workers over a period of twelve years to build a complex of Taoist temples and monasteries on the Wudang Mountains. The result was a grand structure consisting of 9 palaces, 81 temples, and 36 monasteries, all connected by over 100 bridges.\nAnother notable construction project during this time was the Porcelain Tower in Nanjing, which was built between 1412 and 1422 by over a hundred thousand soldiers and workers. This impressive structure, made entirely of white \"porcelain\" bricks, stood at over 70 meters tall and served as a prominent landmark in Nanjing until its destruction during the Taiping Rebellion.\nCulture.\nThe Emperor portrayed himself as a patron of education and a model Confucian leader in order to solidify his legitimacy. He actively promoted traditional education, commissioned the compilation of Confucian classics, and declared Confucianism as the official state ideology. In 1414, he tasked scholars from the Hanlin Academy with creating a comprehensive collection of commentaries on the Four Books and Five Classics by Zhu Xi and other prominent Confucian thinkers of his school. This project was completed by October 1415 and became the official guide for teaching and examinations.\nThe \"Yongle Encyclopedia\" was the most significant and extensive collection of encyclopedias during the Yongle era. The Emperor commissioned Grand Secretary Xie Jin to compile a collection that included all known books, either partially or completely. This project involved 2,169 scholars from the Hanlin Academy and the Imperial University and took four years to complete, finishing in December 1407. The scope of the encyclopedia was vast, consisting of 22,277 \"juan\" (chapters), with the contents alone spanning 60 \"juan\". but it was not published and only a few manuscripts were kept in the imperial libraries. Currently, only 700 \"juan\" have survived. This encyclopedia covered a wide range of topics and included materials from all fields of Chinese literature. Its significance lies in its contribution to the preservation of Chinese literature, as it was used by compilers in the 17th century.\nThe Emperor was impressed by the lamas invited from Tibet. In Beijing, there were several monasteries staffed by Tibetans, with a population of no less than two thousand, but his reverence for Buddhism had its boundaries. He only allowed his subjects to become monks to a limited extent, following the Hongwu Emperor's decree that only one man out of forty could do so. On the other hand, he promoted the spread of Buddhism among the non-Chinese peoples of the empire, but with purely political motives\u2014to pacify conflicts and maintain peaceful rule over them.\nForeign policy.\nGeneral characteristics.\nDuring the Yongle era, Ming China was considered the strongest, wealthiest, and most populous country in the world. The Yongle Emperor, along with the Xuande Emperor to a large extent, stood out from their predecessors and successors due to their active and expensive military and diplomatic efforts. Their main goal was to expand the influence of the Ming dynasty beyond the borders of China. During the Yongle Emperor's reign, his envoys visited numerous nearby and distant countries, seeking to establish at least a symbolic recognition of the Ming emperor's supremacy and sovereignty. Similar to his father, the Yongle Emperor had hoped to conquer Mongolia in order to resolve security concerns in the north. To the east and south, the Ming dynasty controlled the seas from Japan to the Strait of Malacca. Chinese naval forces maintained peace on trade routes in Southeast Asia and regularly visited the Indian Ocean, a region that had previously been rarely explored by the Chinese. In addition to Mongolia, Ming missions also traveled to Manchuria in the north and reached as far as the Timurid Empire in the west.\nIn an effort to incorporate countries from around the world into the tributary system of subordination to the Ming dynasty, the Emperor utilized a combination of military force, diplomatic contacts, trade exchange, and the spread of Chinese culture. According to Confucian political thought, China was to be seen as the center of civilization by other nations and states. These missions not only demonstrated the power of the Ming dynasty, but also enforced recognition of the Yongle Emperor's supremacy and brought valuable local products. The strength of the Ming dynasty is evident in the number of rulers from Asian states who made the journey to China. It was rare for monarchs to leave their own country, highlighting the immense pressure they were under.\nForeign trade.\nOne of the main reasons the Ming sought to engage in foreign activities during the Yongle era was to revive the declining foreign trade, which had suffered under the isolationist policies of the Hongwu Emperor. Foreign trade was seen as a valuable source of additional income for the imperial treasury, which was necessary given the high government expenditures at the time, but the Ming emperor maintained a monopoly on foreign trade and entrusted it to his personal servants\u2014eunuchs. He also strictly prohibited his subjects from engaging in overseas trade and only allowed foreigners to enter China for tributary missions. Any violation of this state monopoly, known as the \"Haijin\" policy, was considered a serious offense and was punished by the government as piracy or smuggling.\nDuring the Yongle era, there was a significant increase in foreign trade. Large quantities of porcelain were exported to traditional markets in East and Southeast Asia, Central Asia, and the Ottoman Empire. The export of silk and silk clothing was even more significant, having a major impact on economies throughout Asia. For example, Bengali textile mills imported Chinese silk for processing and re-export, while Egyptian textile manufacturers suffered from competition from the East.\nThe revival of trade in East Asia was accompanied by an outflow of copper coins from China to other regions such as Korea, Japan, Southeast Asia, and India. This led to the growth of Malacca and ports in northern Java, which became more important than older trading centers. The influx of Chinese coins also boosted local trade. Chinese copper coins were the standard currency in Brunei, Sumbawa, and the Moluccas until the early 16th century. \nChina's prosperity also had a positive impact on other regions such as Central and Western Asia, Korea, Japan, Southeast Asia, India, the Middle East, and East Africa. In more distant countries, where silver was the only valuable commodity for trade, its outflow to China's economy became a concern. In the first decades of the 15th century, governments from London to Cairo complained about the outflow of silver to the East.\nTibet and Nepal.\nIn Tibet, the Hongwu Emperor did not establish contacts with the kings of the Phagmodrupa dynasty, but instead with the Karmapa, who ruled southeastern Tibet (Kham), which was adjacent to China. The first envoy from the Karmapa arrived in Nanjing in late 1372. The 5th Karmapa, Deshin Shekpa, was known for his reputation as a miracle worker and had already caught the Yongle Emperor's attention while he was the Prince of Yan. After ascending the throne, he sent a mission led by the eunuch Hou Xian () and the monk Zhiguang () to request a visit from Deshin Shekpa. In 1407, Deshin Shekpa finally arrived in Nanjing, where he was gifted and admired by the Yongle Emperor. He also took the opportunity to visit Mount Wutai. According to Tibetan records, the Emperor even offered to provide an army to help secure Deshin Shekpa's rule over Tibet, but the Karmapa declined. Missions from the Karmapas continued to come to China until the late 1540s.\nAfter the Karmapa's visit, the Yongle Emperor sent several delegations to other religious leaders in Tibet. These delegations were led by Yang Sanbao (), who visited multiple monasteries and convinced several princes to pledge their allegiance to the Ming dynasty. Yang even traveled as far as Nepal, where delegations from Hou Xian and Deng Cheng also visited. In response to an invitation from the Ming government, representatives from the Tibetan Buddhist schools of Sakya and Gelug also journeyed to Nanjing. This strategy of maintaining relationships with various religious schools while ignoring the Tibetan kings ultimately contributed to the fragmentation of Tibet, which was likely a deliberate policy.\nCentral Asia.\nIn the western regions, the Yongle Emperor sent embassies to various cities and states in Central Asia, ranging from the Chinese border to the Timurid Empire. His goal was to establish his superiority and receive tribute by offering Chinese titles and goods in exchange. This tactic proved successful as local rulers, such as Engke Tem\u00fcr of Hami, accepted the title of king (\"wang\") in 1404. Even the three leaders of the Oirats, who were the dominant Western Mongols in Dzungaria, submitted to Ming demands in 1409. However, not all rulers were as receptive. In Samarkand, the Emperor's embassies were unsuccessful and were executed by Emir Timur, who controlled Central Asia. This was similar to the fate of the Hongwu Emperor's embassies before. Timur then gathered an army of 200,000 in Otrar, with the intention of conquering China. He died in February 1405 before he could carry out his plans. His descendants were too preoccupied with internal conflicts and had no interest in waging war against China.\nThe most significant aspect of the Ming dynasty's relations with Central Asian states was the lucrative trade that existed between them. This trade was so profitable that local states were willing to acknowledge their formal subordination to the Ming emperor. Between the years 1402 and 1424, a total of 20 missions were sent from the Timurid capitals of Samarkand and Herat, 44 from Hami, 13 from Turpan, and 32 from other Central Asian states. These missions brought tribute to China in the form of precious metals, jade, horses, camels, sheep, and even lions. In return, they received silk and other luxury goods, as well as paper money which they could use to purchase goods in Chinese markets.\nIn Central Asia, Hami maintained close relations with the government of the Yongle Emperor. He sent envoys multiple times a year, but the Ming government attempted to control trade and discourage independent private activities. Trade with Turpan and Oirats occurred with less frequency. The Ming government also opposed the ongoing conflicts between Central Asian states, although their efforts were not always successful. They were unable to influence the internal affairs of these states.\nTimur's successors, Khalil Sultan and Shah Rukh, maintained positive relations with the Ming court. The Yongle Emperor even sent his chief experts on foreign affairs, Chen Cheng, Li Xian (), and the eunuch Li Da (), to Samarkand and Herat. Furthermore, in his correspondence with Shah Rukh, the Emperor gradually stopped insisting on his subordination, showing a shift towards a more equal relationship. This was likely due to a shared interest in trade, which was prioritized over maintaining prestige.\nMongolia.\nThe Ming government attempted to incorporate the Mongols into the tributary trade system. In this system, the Mongols would provide horses and other domestic animals in exchange for paper money, silver, silk, cloth, and titles and ranks for their leaders, but the Ming government placed restrictions on the amount of trade allowed. If the nomads were unable to obtain enough goods through peaceful means, they resorted to raiding. As a result, many Mongols migrated to China and often served in the military instead of being conscripted into the declining \"Weisuo\" system.\nThe Mongols were divided into two main groups: the Western (Oirats) and Eastern Mongols. In addition, the Uriankhai formed a separate group. The Ming dynasty had a strong relationship with the Uriankhai, who aided the Yongle Emperor during the civil war and earned his trust. As a result, the Emperor resettled them in the territory that had been vacated by Ming troops in 1403.\nDuring the early years of the Yongle Emperor's reign, the Mongols of eastern Mongolia remained persistently hostile, but the Ming government was able to establish relations with the weaker Oirats and their envoys began to visit China regularly from 1408. In 1409, the Oirats, encouraged by the Ming, launched an attack on the Eastern Mongols. In response, the Ming army also attacked the Eastern Mongols, but suffered a defeat in September of that year, resulting in the death of their commander Qiu Fu. This prompted the Emperor to personally take action against the Mongols. In March 1410, he led an army of hundreds of thousands from Beijing and after a three-month campaign, he was able to defeat \u00d6ljei Tem\u00fcr Khan Bunyashiri and his chancellor Arughtai. Following this victory, the Emperor returned to China. As a result, the Ming dynasty enjoyed peaceful relations with the Eastern Mongols, who were now led by Arughtai, for the next ten years.\nThe period of peace in the north was short-lived. In April 1414, the Yongle Emperor launched a second campaign into Mongolia, this time against the formidable Oirats. The Oirat cavalry suffered heavy losses in a battle along the upper Tuul River due to the superior firepower of the Ming artillery. By August, the Emperor was content with the situation and returned to Beijing.\nThe period of peace in the north came to an end in 1421 when the Eastern Mongols began to launch raids across the border. Despite facing opposition from his ministers, the Yongle Emperor decided to march against them in 1422, 1423, and 1424, but his efforts were ultimately unsuccessful. The large amount of money spent on equipping the armies proved to be a waste when the Mongols refused to engage in battle. The Emperor died while returning from his fifth campaign in Mongolia. \nDespite his best efforts, the Yongle Emperor was unable to subdue the Mongols. The campaign into Mongolia did not result in any lasting changes and proved to be extremely costly. Although the Chinese had larger troops, more resources, and better weaponry, the nomads' mobility and the vastness of the battlefield negated these advantages. The constant feuding among the Mongol leaders eventually led them to become hostile towards China. In the end, the Yongle Emperor's policies, particularly the decision to withdraw to the Great Wall, weakened the Ming dynasty's position in the steppe.\nManchuria, Korea, and Japan.\nAmong the Jurchens living in Manchuria, the Ming government aimed to maintain peace on the borders, counter Korean influence, acquire horses and other local products such as furs, and promote Chinese culture and values among them. In 1403, the Yongle Emperor sent the first mission to Manchuria, offering Chinese goods and titles in exchange for the Jurchens' recognition of their subordination. From 1411 onwards, the Yongle Emperor dispatched expeditions led by the eunuch Yishiha to the distant hunting tribes of northern Manchuria. Yishiha's squadron sailed down the Amur River, reaching as far as its mouth at Tyr, and declared the local Jurchens as subjects of the Ming dynasty.\nBy acknowledging their subordination to the Ming emperors, the Koreans were able to secure their northern border. This not only brought stability to the border, but also strengthened the legitimacy of the Korean government through official recognition from China. The ruling Joseon dynasty only came into power in 1392. The exchange of envoys, which had been frequent under previous emperors, continued during the Yongle Emperor's reign. The Yongle Emperor's first ambassadors arrived in Korea in 1402 to announce the new emperor's ascension. In the years that followed, there were regular contacts between the two countries, with the Koreans sending two to three delegations per year. Some of the Ming's demands were seen as excessive and difficult by the Koreans, but they still fulfilled them. These demands included providing horses and oxen for military purposes, bronze Buddha statues, relics, paper for printing Buddhist literature, and even sending girls to serve in the imperial harem.\nDuring the Hongwu era, relations with the Ashikaga government of Japan were at a standstill. Hu Weiyong, who was executed in 1380, was accused of conspiring with Japanese assistance. In 1399, Sh\u014dgun Yoshimitsu (r.\u20091369\u00a0\u2013\u00a01408) took the initiative to restore contacts in order to make profit from trade with China. This led to another mission being sent in 1403, during which the Yongle Emperor's sovereignty was recognized. In the same year, the Ming government opened maritime trade offices in Ningbo, Quanzhou, and Guangzhou, which allowed Japanese merchants with government licenses to trade. In 1411, Sh\u014dgun Yoshimochi (r.\u20091408\u00a0\u2013\u00a01428) implemented an isolationist policy and interrupted official relations. He also rejected the Ming's attempt to re-establish relations in 1417. Despite this, the allure of Chinese coins and goods was too strong for the Japanese to resist, and illegal private trade continued from the ports of southern Japan.\n\u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t.\nIn the late 14th century, \u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t (present-day northern Vietnam) was facing internal weakness. In 1400, L\u00ea Qu\u00fd Ly overthrew the Tr\u1ea7n dynasty and changed the name of the state to \u0110\u1ea1i Ngu. Despite pleas from Viet refugees to the Ming government to restore the fallen dynasty, the Yongle Emperor recognized the new Viet government and confirmed L\u00ea Qu\u00fd Ly's son as the ruler of \u0110\u1ea1i Ngu in the winter of 1403, but relations between the two countries were strained due to escalating border disputes. L\u00ea Qu\u00fd Ly prepared for the impending conflict and continued to engage in border skirmishes. In the spring of 1406, his soldiers even ambushed a Ming diplomatic envoys accompanying the Tr\u1ea7n pretender. In response, the Yongle Emperor ordered an invasion. By late 1406, the Ming army had attacked \u0110\u1ea1i Ngu from two directions, quelling resistance by mid-1407. In July, the country was officially annexed to the Ming dynasty as Jiaozhi Province.\nIn 1408, a rebellion led by supporters of the Tr\u1ea7n dynasty broke out and was eventually suppressed by the Ming army in 1409. However, this was not the end of unrest as another rebellion erupted shortly after and was only fully crushed in 1414 when the Chinese captured the rebel leader, Tr\u1ea7n Qu\u00fd Kho\u00e1ng. Despite this, the majority of the Ming army was unable to withdraw until 1416. By the end of 1417, the Viet people rose up in rebellion once again. This time, they were led by L\u00ea L\u1ee3i, a skilled military leader who gained widespread support from the population. Despite their efforts, the Ming generals were unable to suppress the rebellion until the end of the Yongle Emperor's reign.\nOther Southeast Asian countries.\nIn Southeast Asia, the Ming dynasty had a strong presence during the Yongle era. From 1402 to 1424, the Ming government sent 62 missions to Southeast Asian countries and states (excluding \u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t), and received 95 in return. These included important countries such as Champa (in modern-day Vietnam), Malacca, Ayutthaya (in present-day Thailand), Majapahit (centered in Java), Samudera in Sumatra, Khmer, and Brunei, all of which paid tribute to the Yongle Emperor. These local rulers sent precious metals, spices, and rare animals to China, and in return received Chinese goods and coins. The Ming government showed a strong interest in trade and left a lasting impression of their naval power in Southeast Asia, although their focus shifted to northern affairs after 1413.\nThe ruler of Brunei was the first foreign ruler to sail to Nanjing and visit the Yongle Emperor's court. This visit resulted in more favorable terms of trade relations for Brunei compared to other countries, but tributary exchange with the Philippines was limited. Champa was a significant ally against insurgents in Jiaozhi, as they were traditional enemies, but relations cooled in 1414 when the Yongle Emperor refused to return territories previously conquered by the Viets. Despite this, official missions between the two countries continued. The Ming dynasty viewed Ayutthaya positively and had a peaceful relationship with them. In exchange for Ming protection of Malacca, Ayutthaya provided tribute and received profits from the trade.\nThe rise of Malacca as a significant trading center can be attributed to the support of the Ming dynasty. This support was crucial for the Chinese as it provided them with a strategic foothold in the Strait of Malacca and a reliable vassal. In fact, three successive rulers of Malacca made visits to the imperial court to pledge their loyalty to the Yongle Emperor. As a result, the Ming dynasty established a fortified trading post in Malacca, which served as a supply base for their missions to the Indian Ocean. Additionally, during the early 15th century, the sultan of Samudera had a close association with the Ming dynasty, with the Ming fleet stationed on a nearby island to support him in times of war.\nThe Javanese Majapahit Empire weakened in the early 15th century due to the division of Java and civil war. The presence of the Ming dynasty suppressed its influence in Sumatra, the Malay Peninsula, Borneo, and the southern Philippines. In Java itself, the Ming fleet forcibly subdued the local rulers. In 1407, the Ming expedition became involved in the local conflicts, resulting in the loss of 170 Chinese soldiers. Ming envoys then coerced the Javanese king into paying an indemnity of 60,000 \"liang\" (2,238 kg) of gold, threatening that Java would suffer the same fate as \u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t if they did not comply.\nIndian Ocean.\nIn 1405, the Yongle Emperor appointed his favorite commander, the eunuch Zheng He, as admiral of a fleet with the purpose of expanding China's influence and collecting tribute from various nations. A total of two thousand ships were constructed to aid Zheng He in his seven voyages, including numerous large \"treasure ships\".\nIn the early years of the Yongle Emperor's reign, Timur's campaigns disrupted traditional trade connections with Central Asia. As a result, one of the initial goals of sending emissaries by sea to the Indian Ocean may have been to find potential allies against the Timurid Empire of Timur, but this goal became less relevant when Timur died in 1405, at the beginning of the campaign to China. The Ming dynasty then established proper relations with his successors.\nFrom 1405 to 1421, Zheng He embarked on six voyages to the Indian Ocean. The first voyage took place from 1405 to 1407 and consisted of 250 or 317 ships, including 62 large \"treasure ships\". A total of 27,800 people were on board. The final voyage was made during the reign of the Xuande Emperor from 1431 to 1433. Chinese sailors followed the main trade routes of Southeast and South Asia, sailing into the Indian Ocean. During the first three expeditions, they sailed to South India, with their main destination being Calicut, the commercial center of the region. In the following four voyages, they reached Hormuz in Persia, while separate squadrons visited various ports in the Arabian Peninsula and East Africa.\nIn addition to foreign policy and trade goals, Zheng He's expeditions also had the task of mapping the countries visited and had an educational aspect as well. The Chinese were interested in bringing back exotic animals and plants for medicinal purposes.\nAfter the deaths of the Xuande Emperor and Zheng He, the practice of large-scale expeditions was discontinued. The loss of key supporters of long-distance sailing was just one factor in the decision to abandon an active maritime policy. In the eyes of the bureaucracy, the high costs of maintaining the fleet primarily meant an undue increase in the power of eunuchs, who controlled these funds. By this logic, cutting naval expenditures also reduced the eunuchs' influence at court.\nDeath and legacy.\nOn 1 April 1424, the Emperor embarked on his final campaign into Mongolia, but the campaign was unsuccessful and he fell into a deep depression. He died on 12 August 1424 in Yumuchuan, located north of Duolun. While official annals do not provide a specific cause of death, private records suggest that he suffered from multiple strokes in his final years, with the last one ultimately proving to be fatal. He was buried in the Chang Mausoleum (), the first of the Ming tombs located north of Beijing.\nThe Yongle Emperor was given the posthumous name Emperor Wen (Cultured Emperor) and the temple name Taizong (Grand Ancestor), which was customary for second emperors of the dynasty. In 1538, the Jiajing Emperor changed the temple name to Chengzu (Accomplished Progenitor) in order to strengthen the legitimacy of his decision to elevate his father to imperial status after his death. The use of the character \"cheng\", which means perfection, completion, or accomplishment, shows a high level of respect for the Yongle Emperor and his accomplishments.\nFor Chinese historians in the following centuries, the Yongle Emperor represented the ideal ruler\u2014an energetic and capable general who led China to power, while also being a Confucian and a restorer of traditional institutions. They credited him with unifying northern and southern China, but also criticized his violent overthrow of his predecessor and the subsequent purges. His high spending on foreign expansion and domestic projects, particularly the relocation of the capital, was met with sharp disapproval even during his lifetime. Late Ming historians, however, justified the negative effects of his rule as necessary for building a powerful empire. They also strongly condemned the Yongle Emperror's interventions in education, as his promotion of neo-Confucian orthodoxy led to a decline in scholarship and intellectual development.\nModern historians such as Chan Hok-lam and Wang Yuan-kang argue that the Yongle Emperor's desire for a unified China and domination over the world ultimately led to decisions that proved problematic in the long run. They believe that abandoning the outer defense line north of the Great Wall was a strategic mistake, making the country more vulnerable to attacks. Additionally, the economic downturn at the time made it difficult to support large military operations, while the strict control over trade with the Mongols only worsened relations between the two. The invasion of \u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t was also a mistake, as the Ming defeat weakened the empire's reputation in Southeast Asia.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nWorks cited.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

They were sons of Carus, a general raised to the office of praetorian prefect under Emperor Probus in 282.\nEarly life and Carus' reign.\nNumerian was the younger son of Carus. In 282, the legions of the upper Danube in Raetia and Noricum proclaimed as emperor Numerian's father, the praetorian prefect Marcus Aurelius Carus, after a mutiny against the emperor Probus, in which the latter was killed. By one account, Carus had \"himself\" rebelled against the emperor, and Probus' army, stationed in Sirmium (Sremska Mitrovica, Serbia), decided they did not wish to fight Carus and assassinated their emperor instead. According to the \"Historia Augusta\", Carus was not responsible for Probus's death, and inflicted severe punishment upon the murderers. Carus, already sixty, wished to establish a dynasty and immediately elevated Carinus and Numerian to the rank of Caesar.\nIn 283, Carus left Carinus in charge of the West and moved with Numerian and his praetorian prefect Arrius Aper to the East to wage war against the Sassanid Empire. The Sassanids had been embroiled in a succession dispute since the death of Shapur and were in no position to oppose Carus' advance.\nAccording to Zonaras, Eutropius, and Festus, Carus won a major victory against the Persians, taking Seleucia and the Sassanid capital of Ctesiphon (near modern Al-Mada'in, Iraq), cities on opposite banks of the Tigris. In celebration, Numerian, Carus, and Carinus all took the title \"Persici maximi\". Carus died in July or early August of 283, allegedly due to a strike of lightning.\nNumerian and Carinus as Augusti.\nThe death of Carus left Numerian and Carinus as the new Augusti. Carinus quickly made his way to Rome from Gaul, arriving in January 284, while Numerian lingered in the East. The Roman retreat from Persia was orderly and unopposed, for the Persian King, Bahram II, was still struggling to establish his authority.\nBy March 284, Numerian had only reached Emesa (Homs) in Syria; by November, only Asia Minor. In Emesa he was apparently still alive and in good health, as he issued the only extant rescript in his name there. Coins were issued in his name in Cyzicus at some time before the end of 284, but it is impossible to know whether he was still in the public eye by that point.\nAfter Emesa, Numerian's staff, including the prefect Aper, reported that Numerian suffered from an inflammation of the eyes and had to travel in a closed coach. When the army reached Bithynia, or Thrace, some of Numerian's soldiers smelled an odor reminiscent of a decaying corpse emanating from the coach. They opened its curtains and found Numerian dead.\nAfter Numerian's death.\nAper officially broke the news of Numerian's death in Nicomedia (\u0130zmit) in November 284, and the discovery, which the prefect attempted to conceal, as due to the forwardness of the soldiery, who forced open the Imperial tent to investigate for themselves the situation of their invisible monarch. Numerian's generals and tribunes called a council for the succession, which met at Chalcedon across the Bosphorus, where they chose as emperor Diocletian, commander of the cavalry arm of the imperial bodyguard, despite Aper's attempts to garner support. The army of the east unanimously saluted their new Augustus. Diocletian accepted the purple imperial vestments and raised his sword to the light of the sun, swearing an oath denying responsibility for Numerian's death. He asserted that Aper had killed Numerian and concealed the deed.

It was brought to Canada by French settlers celebrating the traditional feast day of the Nativity of Saint John the Baptist. It was declared a public holiday in Quebec in 1925, with publicly financed events organized province-wide by a \"Comit\u00e9 organisateur de la f\u00eate nationale du Qu\u00e9bec\".\nOrigins.\nThe tradition landed in Canada with the first French colonists. The first mention of celebrations of Saint-Jean-Baptiste in North America dates back to 1606, when settlers en route to the future Acadia rested on the coast of Newfoundland, June 23. The second mention of celebrations, according to the Jesuit \"Relations\", occurred on the banks of the Saint Lawrence River on the evening of June 23, 1636, with a bonfire and five cannon shots.\nIn Lower Canada, the celebration of the nativity of St. John the Baptist took a patriotic tone in 1834 on the initiative of one of the founders of the newspaper \"La Minerve\", Ludger Duvernay, who would later become the first president of the Saint-Jean-Baptiste Society. In the spring of 1834, Duvernay and other \"patriotes\" attended the celebrations of the first St. Patrick's Day, the celebration of the Irish diaspora, in Montreal. This would give him and others the idea of organizing something similar for all the \"Canadiens\" and their friends.\nOn that June 24, George-\u00c9tienne Cartier's \"\u00d4 Canada! mon pays, mes amours\" was first sung during a grand patriotic banquet gathering about sixty francophones and anglophones of Montreal, in the gardens of lawyer John McDonnell, near the old Windsor Station. The \"Canada\" in the song refers to Lower Canada, today's southern Quebec. Rounds of toasts went to the \"Parti patriote\", the United States, Ireland, and the Ninety-Two Resolutions.\nTwo days later, \"La Minerve\" concluded: \"This holiday, whose goal is to solidify the union of the \"Canadiens\", will not go without bearing fruit. It will be celebrated annually as a national holiday and will not miss producing the happiest results.\" The celebration recurred in 1835, 1836, 1837.\nFollowing the defeat of the insurrectional movement during the Lower Canada Rebellion and the military repressions which followed, the day was not celebrated for several years.\nIn 1834, Duvernay established the charitable Association Saint-Jean Baptiste in order to have the Saint-Jean-Baptiste celebrated that year. The association was chartered in 1849 with the mission of promoting social and moral progress. (See Saint-Jean-Baptiste Society.)\nThe celebrations were supported by the Catholic Church and were primarily religious around that time. The lighting of bonfires, a traditional custom on the Nativity of Saint John which ultimately reached back to pre-Christian Midsummer celebrations were still lit at night. In addition, the first Saint-Jean-Baptiste parades were organized. They became an important tradition over time. The procession of allegorical floats was introduced in 1874.\nOn June 24, 1880, the Saint-Jean-Baptiste Society organized the gathering of all francophone communities across North America. The event was the first National Congress of French Canadians (\"Congr\u00e8s national des Canadiens fran\u00e7ais\"). On this occasion, the citizens of Quebec City were the first ones to hear the \"\u00d4 Canada\" of Calixa Lavall\u00e9e, based on a poem by a Quebec Superior Court judge, Adolphe-Basile Routhier. The song was commissioned by the Saint-Jean-Baptiste Society. It was well received but did not become a widely known song for many years. English words were later written for a royal tour in 1901. In 1980, \"O Canada\" became the official national anthem of Canada.\nIn 1908, Pope Pius X designated St. John the Baptist as the patron saint of French Canadians. From 1914 to 1923 the processions were not held. In 1925, 91 years after the Ludger Duvernay's banquet in Montreal, June 24 became provincially a legal holiday in Quebec.\nThe \"F\u00eate nationale\".\nIn Quebec, June 24 is officially a paid statutory public holiday called the \"National Holiday\" under the \"Act Respecting Labour Standards\". In 1977, an Order in Council by Lieutenant Governor Hugues Lapointe, on the advice of Premier Ren\u00e9 L\u00e9vesque, declared June 24 the provincial holiday in Quebec.\nThe following year, the National Holiday Organizing Committee () was created. The committee initially entrusted the organization of the events to the \"Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des festivals populaires du Qu\u00e9bec\". In 1984, on the occasion of the 150th anniversary of the SSJB, the organization of the celebrations was entrusted to the sovereigntist \"Mouvement national des Qu\u00e9b\u00e9coises et des Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois\" (MNQ).\nBy making it a statutory holiday, the day became a holiday for all Quebecers rather than only those of French-Canadian or Catholic origins. Celebrations were gradually secularized, primarily due to actions taken by the MNQ, and June 23 and 24 became as they are now known. Many festivities take place on the night before the holiday proper.\nWhile the religious significance of the civic celebration is gone, the day remains popularly called \"la St-Jean-Baptiste\" or simply \"la St-Jean\" (notably by businesses), and is still observed in churches.\nIn 2010 and 2011, Franco-Ontarian New Democratic MP Claude Gravelle introduced a private member's bill in the House of Commons to recognize Saint-Jean-Baptiste Day as a federal holiday in Canada.\nPolitical nature of the celebration.\nDuring and immediately after the Quiet Revolution, Saint-Jean-Baptiste Day became highly politicized. The religious symbolism associated with the celebrations was replaced by political ideals of Quebec separatism.\nGovernor General Georges Vanier, who, as viceroy, had always fostered unity and biculturalism, found himself the target of Quebec sovereigntists in Montreal, on Saint-Jean-Baptiste Day, 1964, wherein a group of sovereigntists held placards reading \"Vanier vendu\" (\"Vanier the sell-out\") and \"Vanier fou de la Reine\" (\"Vanier, jester to the Queen\").\nFour years later, with the new Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau in attendance on the eve of a general election, a riot broke out on Saint-Jean-Baptiste Day. A group of agitators threw bottles at the Prime Minister in an effort to make him feel unwelcome at the ceremony. Trudeau was filmed refusing to take cover or leave the grandstand, saying that he was a Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois and would not be intimidated by a drunken mob. The scene was broadcast on T\u00e9l\u00e9vision de Radio-Canada's and CBC's evening news. Many saw it as an open act of courage, and the Prime Minister's defiance impressed the electorate and contributed to his Liberal Party winning a significant majority the next day.\nDuring the French-language network SRC's televised coverage of the 1969 Montreal parade, filmmakers Bernard Gosselin and Pierre Perrault were asked to withdraw from the airwaves after nationalist and sarcastic comments. At one point they suggested the creation of a Ministry of Boastfulness and a High Commissioner of kvetching. There was a riot and the Saint-Jean-Baptiste icon was destroyed. This led to the interruption of the parade, which did not take place the next year.\nIn June 2009, Quebec bands Lake of Stew and Bloodshot Bill, whose members are bilingual anglophone Quebecers, were added to the program of a local celebration in Montreal called \"L'Autre St-Jean\" (\"The Other St-Jean\"). When it became known that they would be performing their songs in English, there were several complaints and later the musicians were barred from the celebrations. The Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Saint-Jean-Baptiste President, Mario Beaulieu, defended the decision to cancel these musicians' performances, by stating that the official language of the province of Quebec is French. However, after public outrage from both the anglophone and francophone communities, these two bands were returned to the program when it was clarified that the bands were free to sing songs in English as well as French.\nBy government regulation, however, the St-Jean program must be conducted in French (even by such internationally and nationally famous anglophone artists such as Martha Wainwright and Patrick Watson).\nThe festival has attempted to be more inclusive, as groups have sung in Creole and for the 2008 celebrations, Samian, \"the world's first aboriginal Algonquin language rapper\", sang at Montreal's celebration.\nIn 2017, there was a controversy at the F\u00eate nationale parade when a float featuring white performers was performing a popular Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois anthem, and pushed by several black youths dressed in beige. Spectators interpreted the sight as racist, and symbolic of slavery.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "74286", "revid": "48181213", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=74286", "title": "Ashland, Oregon", "text": "Ashland is a city in Jackson County, Oregon, United States. It lies along Interstate 5 approximately 16 miles (26\u00a0km) north of the California border and near the south end of the Rogue Valley. The city's population was 21,360 at the 2020 census.\nThe city is the home of Southern Oregon University (SOU) and the Oregon Shakespeare Festival (OSF). These are important contributors to Ashland's economy, which also depends on restaurants, galleries, and retail stores that cater to tourists. Lithia Park along Ashland Creek, historic buildings, and a paved intercity bike trail provide additional visitor attractions.\nAshland, originally called \"Ashland Mills\", was named after Ashland County, Ohio, the original home of founder Abel Helman, and secondarily for Ashland, Kentucky, where other founders had family connections. Ashland has a council-manager government assisted by citizen committees. Historically, its liberal politics have differed, often sharply, with much of the rest of southwest Oregon.\nHistory.\nPrior to the arrival of White settlers in mid-19th century, the Shasta people lived in the valley along Ashland Creek approximately where today's city is located. Early Hudson's Bay Company hunters and trappers following the Siskiyou Trail passed through the site in the 1820s. In the late 1840s, mainly American settlers following the Applegate Trail began passing through the area. By the early 1850s, the Donation Land Claim Act brought many to the Rogue Valley and into conflict with its native people. These often violent clashes, known ultimately as the Rogue River Wars, continued until 1856.\nIn 1851, gold was discovered at Rich Gulch, a tributary of Jackson Creek, and a tent city grew on its banks, today's Jacksonville. Settlers arrived in the Ashland area in January 1852, including Robert B. Hargadine, Sylvester Pease, Abel D. Helman, Eber Emery, and others. Helman and Hargadine filed the first donation land claims in Ashland. Helman and Emery built a sawmill along what was then called Mill Creek to turn timber into lumber for settlers. In 1854, they and another settler, M. B. Morris, built a second mill, Ashland Flouring Mills, to grind local wheat into flour. The community around the mill became known as \"Ashland Mills\". A post office was established in Ashland Mills in 1855 with Helman as postmaster.\nDuring the 1860s and 1870s the community grew, establishing a school, churches, businesses and a large employer, Ashland Woolen Mills, which produced clothing and blankets from local wool. In 1871, the Post Office dropped \"Mills\" from Ashland's name. In 1872 Reverend J. H. Skidmore opened a college, Ashland Academy, a predecessor of Southern Oregon University.\nIn 1887, Portland, Oregon, and San Francisco, California, were joined by rail at Ashland. Until 1926, when most rail service began taking a different route (east through Klamath Falls to avoid the steep grade through the Siskiyou Mountains), Ashland thrived on rail trade of local products, including pears, peaches, and apples.\nIn 1908, the Women's Civic Improvement Club petitioned for the creation of community space along Ashland Creek, which became Ashland Canyon Park. The discovery of lithia water near Emigrant Lake around the same time led to a plan to establish a mineral spa at the park. Voters approved bonds to pay for the project, which included piping the mineral water from its source to Ashland. The town engaged John McLaren, landscape architect of San Francisco's Golden Gate Park, to design the park, renamed Lithia Springs Park, later shortened to Lithia Park. Although the park was popular, the mineral spa plans proved too expensive for local taxpayers and were abandoned in 1916. Meanwhile, entrepreneurs took to bottling and selling mineral waters from the area's springs.\nDuring the Fourth of July celebration in 1935, Angus L. Bowmer arranged the first performances of what would become the Oregon Shakespeare Festival. The festival has grown since then, and has become an award-winning and internationally known regional theater company.\nAshland was a sundown town at least until World War II.\nMany of Ashland's historic buildings have been preserved and restored. The city has 59 individual structures and four historic districts (Downtown District, Siskiyou-Hargadine District, Railroad District, Skidmore Academy District) on the National Register of Historic Places. The structures include the Enders Building (home of the Columbia Hotel), which from 1910 to 1928 contained the largest mercantile establishment between Sacramento and Portland. Some of Ashland's houses built before 1900 are: the Orlando Coolidge House (1875), the Isaac Woolen House (1876), the W. H. Atkinson House (1880), the John McCall House (1883), the Nils Ahlstrom House (1888), the H. B. Carter House (1888), and the Colonel William H. Silsby House (1896). The E. V. Carter House (built in 1909) is in a remarkably good state of preservation.\nGeography.\nAshland is at above sea level in the foothills of the Siskiyou and Cascade ranges, about north of the California border on Interstate 5 (I-5). About south of Ashland and north of the California border is Siskiyou Summit, which at is the highest point on I-5. Ashland is about southeast of Medford and south of Portland. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of about , all land.\nAshland Creek and its tributaries begin on the flanks of Mount Ashland, at above sea level in the Siskiyou Mountains south of the city. Upstream (south) of the city boundary, these streams flow mainly through the Rogue River\u2013Siskiyou National Forest. The creek flows through the city to meet Bear Creek, which roughly parallels I-5 along the east side of Ashland. Bear Creek, one of many streams in the Rogue Valley, flows generally northwest to join the Rogue River near Gold Hill, and from there the river flows generally west to its mouth on the Pacific Ocean.\nOregon Route 99, running roughly parallel to I-5, passes through downtown Ashland. Oregon Route 66 enters Ashland from the east and intersects Route 99 near the city center. Route 66 leads east to Klamath Falls.\nClimate.\nAshland lies within Oregon's southwest interior climate zone, in which all but the higher-elevation sites are in the rain shadow of the Oregon Coast Range to the west. The largest urban areas in this zone in addition to Ashland are Medford and Grants Pass in the Rogue Valley, and Roseburg in the Umpqua River Valley further north. Although the mountain peaks in this zone receive up to of precipitation a year, the urban areas and the valleys in which they lie generally get or less. This valley climate is particularly good for growing fruit, especially pears, and for producing other crops and farm goods such as hay, grain, poultry, and beef.\nCloud cover in nearby Medford varies from an average of 21\u00a0percent in July to 86\u00a0percent in December. On average, precipitation falls in Ashland on 114 days each year and totals about . The average annual snowfall is only . The average relative humidity, measured at 4 p.m. daily, is 47\u00a0percent in Medford, varying from 26\u00a0percent in July to 76\u00a0percent in December. According to the K\u00f6ppen climate classification system, Ashland has a warm-summer Mediterranean climate (\"Csb\").\nOn average, Ashland tends to be 2-3\u00a0\u00b0F cooler than Medford due to being 600 feet higher in elevation. The coolest month is December, with an average high temperature of , and the warmest month is July, with an average high of about . The highest temperature ever recorded in Ashland was , observed on June 29, 2021, and the record low of occurred in December 1972. The wettest \"rain year\" has been from July 1926 to June 1927 with and the driest from July 1954 to June 1955 with only . The wettest month on record has been December 1964 with , but the only other months with over have been December 1996 with , November 1903 with and November 1998 with .\nAshland's coldest recorded daytime temperature was in December 1972. During the full year, the coldest day of the year averages around or just above freezing. Warm summer nights are rare, with the record of being set as far back as 1910. The mean for the warmest summer night between 1991 and 2020 was at a mild .\nDemographics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"US Census population/styles.css\"/&gt;\nAt the census of 2010, there were 20,078 people, 9,409 households, and 4,542 families residing in the city. The population density was . There were 10,455 housing units at an average density of . The racial makeup of the city was about 90% White, 2% Asian, 1% African American, 1% Native American, 0.3% Pacific Islander, 1.4% from other races, and 4% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were about 5% of the population.\nThere were 9,409 households, out of which about 21% had children under the age of 18 living with them. About 34% were married couples living together; 10% had a female householder with no husband present, about 4% had a male householder with no wife present, and about 52% were non-families. About 38% of all households were made up of individuals, and 13.5% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.03 and the average family size was 2.63.\nThe median age in the city was 42.9 years. About 16% of residents were under the age of 18, and about 16% were between the ages of 18 and 24. Rounded to the nearest whole number, 21% were from 25 to 44 years old; 30% were from 45 to 64; and 18% were 65 years of age or older. The gender makeup of the city was about 46% male and 54% female.\nIn 2010, the median income for a household in the city was $41,334, and the median income for a family was $58,409. Males had a median income of $50,368 versus $34,202 for females. The per capita income for the city was $28,941. About 21% of the population and 13% of families had incomes below the poverty line. Out of the total population, about 30% of those under the age of 18 and 3.5% of those 65 and older were living below the poverty line.\nBy 2020, the population had risen to 21,360. The per capita income had risen to about $45,000 and the median household income to $64,000. Of the total population, 96% of Ashland residents 25 and older had graduated from high school while 62% had a bachelor's degree or higher.\nGovernment.\nAshland has a council-manager government since a Charter Amendment was passed by the voters in a Special Election in May 2020, (changing the form of government from Mayor/Administrator). It consists of a city manager, a mayor, and six council members. The mayor and council members are elected by the city's voters to serve staggered four-year terms.\nJulie Akins, after serving a partial term as a city councilor, was elected as mayor in 2020. On January 23, 2023, she announced her resignation effective January 27. On February 7, the council unanimously elected Tonya Graham to serve the remainder of Akins' term.\nPam Marsh, a Democrat from Ashland, represents Ashland and all of Oregon House District 5 in the state legislature. As part of Oregon Senate District 3, Ashland is represented by Democrat Jeff Golden. At the federal level, Cliff Bentz, a Republican, represents Ashland as part of Oregon's 2nd congressional district in the United States House of Representatives. Ron Wyden and Jeff Merkley, both Democrats, serve the state of Oregon in the United States Senate.\nHistorically, Ashland has been a political outlier in southwest Oregon. In the presidential election of 1860, Ashland favored Abraham Lincoln while its neighbors strongly preferred pro-slavery candidates. In the early 1900s, Ashland voters supported women's suffrage and prohibition, generally out of step with the rest of the region. In more recent elections, Ashland has supported tax levies and environmental regulations opposed by voters elsewhere in Jackson and nearby counties. Critics sometimes refer to the city as the \"People's Republic of Ashland\".\nEconomy.\nIncome from tourism is important to Ashland's economy. A large number of restaurants, galleries, and retail stores cater to thousands of visitors who attend plays each year at the Oregon Shakespeare Festival. In 2011, the festival sold more than 390,000 tickets to its theater productions.\nThe town's largest employer is Southern Oregon University (SOU), which has a faculty and staff of more than 750. In addition to the Oregon Shakespeare Festival and the university, health-service providers make significant contributions to the economy. Businesses related to outdoor recreation, transportation, technology, and light manufacturing are also important. In 2010, the Shakespeare Festival employed about 500 people, the hospital about 400, the public schools about 300, and the City of Ashland about 250. The Bathroom Readers' Press, which produces the Uncle John's Bathroom Reader books, is based in Ashland and San Diego. Brammo, specializing in battery-electric motorcycles, was based in Ashland but moved to Talent.\nArts and culture.\nThe Oregon Shakespeare Festival has grown from a summer outdoor series in the 1930s to a season that stretches from February to October, incorporating Shakespearean and non-Shakespearean plays at three theaters. The OSF has become the largest regional repertory theater in the United States.\nThe Oregon Cabaret Theater features musicals and comedy throughout the year. Opened in 1986, the dinner theater occupies a former First Baptist Church built in Mission Revival style. The Ashland Independent Film Festival, which shows international and domestic films of almost every genre, takes place each April in the Varsity Theatre downtown. About 90 films are shown during the five days of the festival. In 2009, Ashland was the setting for the film adaptation of Neil Gaiman's \"Coraline\".\nThe Oregon Center for the Arts at Southern Oregon University focuses on academic programs including creative arts (art, emerging media and creative writing), music, and theater. Affiliated with the center is the Schneider Museum of Art, which has rotation exhibitions of works featuring professional contemporary artists. Also affiliated with the center are chamber music concerts, a Shakespeare institute, a piano series, and other art-related events.\nThe annual Ashland New Plays Festival (ANPF) is a nonprofit organization that encourages playwrights to develop new work through public readings. Each year, the ANPF holds an international competition that winnows hundreds of submissions to four plays that are read to live audiences by professional actors during a five-day festival in October.\nMuseums and other points of interest.\nThe National Fish and Wildlife Forensics Laboratory in Ashland is the world's only laboratory dedicated to solving crimes against wildlife. Using forensic science, experts at the laboratory help wildlife officers to investigate possible crimes against animals and to establish links between victims and suspects in cases that go to court. The laboratory has assisted the International Criminal Police Organization (INTERPOL) and foreign agencies concerned with the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES).\nThe Ashland City Band (ACB) was organized in the late 19th\u00a0century as the Ashland Brass Band. The band used an octagonal gazebo-style bandstand in Lithia Park until the Butler Memorial Band Shell was built in Lithia Park in 1946. The ACB gives public concerts there each summer between June and August.\nParks.\nLithia Park is a park, including on the National Register of Historic Places, that begins near the downtown shopping area and extends upstream along Ashland Creek near the center of the city. It includes two ponds, a Japanese garden, tennis courts, two public greens, a bandshell (outdoor stage) and miles of hiking trails. The name \"Lithia\" comes from natural mineral water found in the Ashland area. It has a strong mineral taste and slight effervescence, and the lithia water fountains found on the town plaza are frequently tasted by unsuspecting tourists (often at the behest of residents or frequent visitors who use the fountains as a cheap, humorous Ashland initiation rite).\nA hiking and biking path, the Bear Creek Greenway, begins in Ashland near the intersection of West Nevada Street with Helman Street, close to the confluence of Ashland Creek (which flows through Lithia Park). The path follows Bear Creek between Ashland and Central Point and passes through Talent, Phoenix, and Medford.\nCalle Guanajuato is a small park bordering Ashland Creek, with several restaurants offering outdoor dining.\nEducation.\nSouthern Oregon University, a public co-ed four-year university founded in 1926, offers courses of study toward degrees in the liberal arts, science, business, and education. With an enrollment of about 4,400 undergraduates as of Fall 2020, this urban university also offers graduate-level programs on its campus.\nIn 2020\u201321, about 59\u00a0percent of the university's students were women, and about 38\u00a0percent were men, while 3\u00a0percent were listed as other/unknown. The student\u2013faculty ratio in 2020\u201321 was 19 to 1. Full-time undergraduate tuition in 2020\u201321 was about $11,000 per year for Oregon residents and $28,000 for non-residents.\nThe Oregon Extension is a college educational extension program located near Ashland in the Cascade\u2013Siskiyou National Monument.\nThe Ashland School District oversees three elementary schools, three optional alternative programs for children in kindergarten through eighth grade; one middle school, and Ashland High School.\nMedia.\nThe \"Mail Tribune\", a newspaper based in Medford that published print editions several days a week, served Ashland until it ceased operations on January 13, 2023. The newspaper also owned the \"Ashland Daily Tidings\", which ran Monday through Saturday until 2019. A non-profit news organization, \"Ashland News\", was founded in 2022 by a former \"Daily Tidings\" editor and has two reporters. The \"Daily Tidings\" domain name was purchased by an unidentified operator in 2024 who began publishing fake articles created by generative AI using the stolen identities of actual journalists.\nFifteen radio stations operate in the region around Ashland, including Jefferson Public Radio and KSKQ, an independent non-profit broadcasting at 89.5 FM. A former student-run radio station with the call letters KSOC and the nickname \"Radio Free Ashland\" shut down in February 2013 after 14 years of broadcasting. Rogue Valley Community Television, based at Southern Oregon University, serves Jackson and Josephine counties. Ashland has no commercial television stations, but nearby Medford has seven.\nInfrastructure and public services.\nThe Asante Ashland Community Hospital is a general medical and surgical hospital that is part of the Asante health network based in Medford. As of 2015, it has 49 inpatient beds.\nThe Ashland Public Library building was expanded from the city's original Carnegie library. In 2003, the historic Carnegie portion of the library was restored. In 2006, budget problems led to the closing in April 2007 of the Ashland Library and 14\u00a0others in Jackson County. The event, which lasted until October 2007, was the largest library closure in U.S. history. Although some of its services are handled by a private company, Library Systems and Services, the Ashland branch remains part of the Jackson County network of public libraries.\nRogue Valley Transportation District (RVTD) provides bus service to much of the city, with connections to Medford, Central Point, Talent, Phoenix, White City, and Jacksonville. In Medford, passengers can connect to other regional bus lines, including the Southwest POINT, a daily shuttle carrying passengers between Brookings and the Amtrak station in Klamath Falls. The Klamath Falls Amtrak Station serves the Coast Starlight long-haul passenger train on track owned by the Union Pacific Railroad. Ashland Municipal Airport, with a asphalt runway, offers general aviation services. Medford International Airport, from Ashland, also serves the city.\nThe City of Ashland moved to improve local broadband Internet access in the late 1990s by creating the Ashland Fiber Network (AFN) and building a fiber optic ring inside the city boundaries. However, by 2006 the city faced difficulties servicing AFN's debt load, which was approaching $15.5\u00a0million. The city hired a new AFN director, Joe Franell, who suggested scrapping cable television service while retaining the more profitable high-speed Internet access. In October 2006, the cable television service was transferred to a local company, Ashland Home Net, while the City retained both the infrastructure and the wholesale Internet business.\nSister cities.\nAshland has two sister cities:\nNotable people.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The team, known as the \"Robins\", currently compete in EFL League Two, the fourth level of the English football league system.\nFounded as Swindon AFC in 1879, the club became Spartans the next year, before finally settling on the name Swindon Town in 1883. It became professional in 1894 as a founding member of the Southern League, later also entering the Western League between 1897 and 1902. The club was crowned Western League champion in 1898\u201399 and Southern League champion in 1910\u201311 and 1913\u201314, before being elected into the Football League in 1920. It remained in the third tier for 43 years until finally securing promotion into the Second Division in 1962\u201363, where it remained for just two seasons. The team lifted the League Cup after beating Arsenal 3\u20131 in the 1969 final, and went on to secure promotion at the end of the 1968\u201369 season with the help of talismanic winger Don Rogers. Relegated again in 1973\u201374, the club dropped into the fourth tier for the first time at the end of the 1981\u201382 season.\nSwindon won the Fourth Division title in 1985\u201386 and secured a second successive promotion the following season under the stewardship of Lou Macari. They went on to claim victory in the 1990 Second Division play-off final under Osvaldo Ardiles, but were denied promotion into the top-flight after admitting to breaching Football League regulations. Glenn Hoddle coached the team to victory in the 1993 play-off final to finally secure a place in the top-flight for the first time in the club's history. However they were relegated out of the Premier League at the end of the 1993\u201394 season and dropped into the third tier with a second consecutive relegation. Promoted again as champions to avoid an FA expulsion and a hat-trick of relegations in 1995\u201396, they remained in the second tier for four seasons until relegation in the 1999\u20132000 season. They dropped into the fourth tier League Two in the 2005\u201306 for the first time since 1986. Since then, Swindon have spent their time between the third and fourth tiers; earning promotion from League Two on three occasions.\nTheir home colours are red and white and their current away colours are sky blue and white. Since 1896 the club has played home matches at the County Ground, currently known as the Nigel Eady County Ground, which now has a capacity of 15,547. Hall of Fame inductee John Trollope played 770 league games for the club between 1960 and 1980, a professional record in English football until it was broken in 2023 by Dean Lewington.\nHistory.\nEarly history.\nSwindon Town Football Club was founded by Reverend William Pitt of Liddington in 1879. The team turned professional in 1894 and joined the Southern League which was founded in the same year. During this period Septimus Atterbury played for the club.\nSwindon reached the FA Cup semi-finals for the first time in the 1909\u201310 season, losing to eventual winners Newcastle United. Barnsley and Swindon were invited to compete for the Dubonnet Cup in 1910 at the Parc des Princes Stadium in Paris. The result was a 2\u20131 victory for Swindon with Harold Fleming scoring both of the club's goals.\nThe following season, 1910\u201311, Swindon Town won the Southern League championship, earning them a Charity Shield match with the Football League champions Manchester United. This, the highest-scoring Charity Shield game to date, was played on 25 September 1911 at Stamford Bridge with Manchester United winning 8\u20134. Some of the proceeds of this game were later donated to the survivors of the \"Titanic\". In 1912 Swindon Town reached the semi-finals of the FA Cup for a second time in 3 years, losing to Barnsley after a replay 1\u20130.\nSwindon's exploits at this time owed a lot to the skilful forward H.J. Fleming who was capped by England 11 times between 1909 and 1914 despite playing outside the Football League. Fleming remained with Swindon throughout a playing career spanning 1907 and 1924 and went on to live in the town for his entire life.\nSwindon entered the Football League in 1920 as a founding member of Division Three and defeated Luton Town 9\u20131 in their first game of the season. This result stands as a record for the club in League matches.\nAfter the outbreak of World War II, the War Department took over the County Ground in 1940, where for a while POWs (Prisoners of War) were housed in huts placed on the pitch; for this the club received compensation of \u00a34,570 in 1945. World War II affected Swindon Town more than most other football clubs and the club was almost disbanded; the club needed a large amount of time to recover and for this reason it failed to make any real impression in the league and would not climb into the second division until 1963 when they finished runners up to Northampton Town. The club was relegated back into Division Three in 1965, but it was about to create a sensation.\n1969\u20132000.\nIn 1969, Swindon beat Arsenal 3\u20131 to win the League Cup for the only time in the club's history. As winners of the League Cup, Swindon were assured of a place in their first European competition: the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup. However, the Football Association had previously agreed to inclusion criteria with the organizers which mandated that only League Cup winners from Division One would be able to take part. As the team were not eligible, the short-lived Anglo-Italian competitions were created to give teams from lower divisions experience in Europe. The first of these, the 1969 Anglo-Italian League Cup, was contested over two legs against Coppa Italia winners AS Roma. Swindon won 5\u20132, with the scorer of two goals in the League Cup final \u2013 Don Rogers \u2013 scoring once and new acquisition Arthur Horsfield acquiring his first hat-trick for the club. The team then went on to win the 1970 Anglo-Italian Cup competition in a tournament beset by hooliganism. The final against SSC Napoli was abandoned after 79 minutes following pitch invasions and a missile barrage, with teargas being employed to allow the teams to return to the dressing room.\nFollowing management changes, Swindon had a long unsuccessful period culminating in them being relegated in 1982 to the Fourth Division, the lowest professional Football League at the time. They were eventually promoted as champions in 1986 with the club achieving a Football League record of 102 points, the second club to score over 100 points in a season, York City having totalled 101 two years earlier. A year later they won the Third Division play-offs to achieve a second successive promotion. Promotion campaign Manager Lou Macari left in 1989 to take charge of West Ham United with veteran midfielder, and former Argentine international, Osvaldo Ardiles replacing him. In his first season, Swindon were Second Division play-off winners, but the club later admitted 36 charges of breaching league rules, 35 due to illegal payments made to players, and were relegated to the Third Division\u00a0\u2014 giving Sunderland promotion to the First Division and Tranmere Rovers to the Second Division. The scandal saw then-chairman Brian Hillier being given a six-month prison sentence and chief accountant Vince Farrar being put on probation. A later appeal saw Swindon Town being allowed to stay in the Second Division.\nArdiles remained in charge until March 1991, when he departed for Newcastle United and was succeeded by new player-manager Glenn Hoddle. Swindon progressed well during the 1991\u201392 season, Hoddle's first full season as manager, and just missed out on the Second Division play-offs, having briefly led the table in the autumn. A year later they beat Leicester City 4\u20133 in the new Division One play-off final to achieve promotion to the Premier League\u00a0\u2014 bringing top-division football to the club for the first time.\nHoddle moved to Chelsea before the 1993\u201394 FA Premier League season began, and was replaced by assistant John Gorman, but Swindon never adjusted to the pace of Premier League football. They were relegated after recording only five wins and conceding 100 goals\u00a0\u2014 the latter record stood until Sheffield United broke it in 2024\u00a0\u2014 and have never returned to the top flight. One of the few successes of the season was a 2\u20132 draw against champions Manchester United in the league.\nThe following year, Swindon were relegated for the second consecutive time and slipped into Division Two. Gorman had been sacked as manager in November 1994, and although his successor, player-manager Steve McMahon, was unable to avoid relegation, he did take Swindon to the semi-finals of the League Cup. McMahon then succeeded in getting Swindon back into Division One on his first attempt, winning the Division Two championship in 1995\u201396. McMahon remained as manager until September 1998, when he left by mutual consent after Swindon lost five of their nine opening games of the 1998\u201399 season.\n2000\u20132020.\nThe club then went through five managers in five years (Andy King was appointed twice), during which time they were again relegated into Division Two. The highlight of the next few seasons was a fifth-place finish in 2003\u201304 as financial troubles persisted. A first-round playoff loss to Brighton &amp; Hove Albion on penalties meant Swindon extended their stay in the third tier, now renamed League One.\nThe club has been beset by financial difficulties throughout its recent history, having been placed into administration twice and also twice fought off winding-up orders from Her Majesty's Customs and Excise over unpaid tax. The board was paying \u00a3100,000 to creditors annually (2% of the annual turnover), and only managed to begin the 2006\u201307 season after sourcing \u00a3500,000 to pay for players' wages.\nIn 2006, caretaker manager (and former player) Iffy Onuora was unable to save Swindon from relegation to League Two meaning they became the first ever former Premier League team to be relegated to the lowest Football League division.\nDennis Wise agreed to become the new Swindon manager in May 2006 following the relegation, with Gus Poyet joining the coaching staff. After a good start to the season, the pair moved to Leeds United in October. Veteran defender Ady Williams and Barry Hunter took temporary charge until Paul Sturrock was appointed on 7 November. Sturrock guided Swindon to promotion back to EFL League One in his first season with the club, earning the third automatic promotion place in a 1\u20131 draw with Walsall in the last game of the 2006\u201307 season.\nIn 2008, Swindon Town was taken over by a consortium, fronted by local businessman Andrew Fitton, with plans to clear all club debts by the end of the 2007\u201308 season.\nPaul Sturrock having departed for Plymouth Argyle, the consortium appointed Sturrock-recommended Maurice Malpas manager, and Swindon finished their first season back in League One in 13th, helped by 15-goal signing Simon Cox. However, the 2008\u201309 campaign started badly and Malpas was sacked on 14 November 2008, with David Byrne taking over temporarily. Danny Wilson was unveiled as the new manager on 26 December 2008. Wilson helped maintain Swindon's League One status and finished in 15th position, though only four points from the relegation zone, in his first season in charge.\nThe 2009\u201310 season would prove a vast improvement, despite the sale of League One top-scorer Simon Cox. The club maintained a play-off position going into the new year, and were at one point in second place with automatic promotion in their own hands. However, a slight slip in form towards the end of the season saw Swindon finish fifth, entering the play-offs against Charlton Athletic. Swindon won the tie on penalties and went on to play in the EFL League One play-offs final against Millwall at Wembley Stadium for a place in the EFL Championship. However, they lost 1\u20130 in what was their first defeat in four appearances at Wembley.\nAfter losing the final Swindon lost their top scorer Billy Paynter who joined Leeds United on a free transfer, and sold club captain Gordon Greer. Still, many bookmakers had Swindon as one of the favourites for promotion to the Championship going into the 2010\u201311 season. Inconsistent form left Swindon in mid-table for much of the season; however, a 4\u20132 win at Charlton Athletic in January left fans hoping for a late-season surge. Instead, top-scorer Charlie Austin was sold to Burnley and the team did not win again for 19 matches. When Danny Wilson resigned on 2 March, Paul Hart was brought in but failed to save the Robins, and on 25 April 2011 Swindon were relegated to League Two yet again after losing 3\u20131 to Sheffield Wednesday. Paul Hart was replaced for the last two games of the season by former player and current reserve and youth team coach Paul Bodin.\nSoon after the season ended, the board revealed that high-profile former player Paolo Di Canio would take his first management position at the club. After losing seven of his first 13 games in charge, Swindon went on a 15-match unbeaten run which put them into promotion contention by the midpoint of the 2011\u201312 season. After a defeat on Boxing Day 2011 to Torquay United, Swindon broke a club record by winning 10 consecutive league games, and by March they were well clear of the chasing pack at the top of League Two. They also enjoyed success in both the FA Cup, beating Premiership side Wigan Athletic in the third round before losing to Championship side Leicester City in the fourth round, and the Football League Trophy, reaching the final at Wembley, where they were runners-up to League One side Chesterfield. On 28 April 2012, Swindon, already promoted, guaranteed their championship of League Two on 28 April after a 5\u20130 drubbing of Port Vale at the County Ground.\nOn 18 February 2013, with Swindon riding high in League One and in contention for a second consecutive promotion, Di Canio announced his resignation, alleging mistreatment by the board of directors, including the sale of Matt Ritchie behind his back, and the financial instability of the club at the time. In his place came Kevin MacDonald who had previously held caretaker roles at Leicester City and Aston Villa. MacDonald guided Swindon to the League One play-offs; however, they were knocked out after a penalty shoot-out defeat to Brentford. On 13 July 2013, MacDonald left Swindon Town by mutual consent, only three weeks before the start of the 2013\u201314 season and only five months after taking the Swindon job.\nIn the 2014\u201315 season, Swindon reached the League One Play-off final again where they lost 4\u20130 to Preston after a season in which they were competing for automatic promotion. They went top of the league after a 3\u20130 win away to Coventry; however, a 2\u20130 defeat to Sheffield United was the first of a series of results that saw Swindon's form dip, and a 1\u20130 defeat to bottom club Yeovil Town meant that Swindon were consigned to finish in the play-offs. They reached Wembley after a record-breaking 5\u20135 draw (winning 7\u20136 on aggregate) against Sheffield United, the highest-scoring EFL play-off match in history.\nIn the 2016\u201317 season, Swindon were relegated to League Two for a third time; they finished third from bottom on 22 April 2017 after losing 2\u20131 to Scunthorpe United with only one more fixture on the road in hand. Following this relegation, manager Luke Williams was sacked after Swindon lost 3\u20130 at Charlton Athletic.\n2020\u2013present.\nOn 9 June 2020, Swindon were crowned League Two champions on the basis of average points per game, matches in the 2019\u201320 season having been suspended from March due to the COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom. However, in the following season, the pandemic created financial difficulties for the club, with the chairman, Lee Power, warning in February 2021 of potential bankruptcy, and then, in April 2021, being charged with breaching FA regulations concerning the club's ownership and/or funding. On 18 April, manager John Sheridan resigned after winning just eight of 33 matches, with the club seven points from safety with four matches to play. The club's relegation to League Two was confirmed following a 5\u20130 defeat by MK Dons on 24 April 2021.\nOn 26 May 2021, John McGreal was appointed Swindon manager but, on 25 June 2021, after less than a month in the job, he left Swindon by mutual consent, citing ownership uncertainty which was preventing him signing new players. Chief executive Steve Anderson also left the club on the same day, followed by director of football Paul Jewell. Swindon supporter groups urged fans to boycott games until the ownership problems were resolved, with High Court hearings due to start on 6 September 2021. On 30 June 2021, the Official Supporters Club was told that a deal to transfer ownership to Australian businessman Clem Morfuni's Axis group would be completed \"in the next couple of weeks\", though the club later complained that the Axis group was delaying payment.\nIn early July 2021, it emerged that players and staff had not received their June wages, and that the County Ground's owner, Swindon Borough Council, was taking legal action after receiving no rent since April 2020. The EFL described the ownership wrangle as \"concerning\" and imposed a transfer embargo on the club. In pre-season friendlies at Melksham Town and Hungerford Town, Swindon fielded sides featuring just a few experienced first-team players, with the rest of the squads being composed of youngsters and trialists. The club then cancelled its planned pre-season friendly with Swansea City at the County Ground on 17 July 2021, citing \"ongoing logistical and operational issues\". On 15 July 2021, it was reported that the club had paid 60% of the outstanding wages due in June. On 21 July 2021, it was reported that Power had transferred ownership of his shares in the club, and that the EFL had granted Morfuni consent to acquire additional shares, having passed its owners' and directors' test. Morfuni appointed Ben Garner as head coach and Ben Chorley as director of football plus Rob Angus (a former Nationwide director) appointed as CEO and, on 26 July 2021, the new management announced their first signing, with midfielder Ben Gladwin returning for a fourth spell at Swindon. On 16 September 2021, Swindon Town was given a suspended three-point deduction by the EFL, relating to the non-payment of player wages in June.\nGarner led Swindon to a sixth-place finish in the 2021\u201322 season with the club beaten on penalties by Port Vale in the play-off semi-finals. The manager then left Swindon to join Charlton Athletic in June 2022, being replaced by his former assistant Scott Lindsey, who spent half a season in the role before moving to Crawley Town. On 31 January 2023, Jody Morris was appointed manager; he was sacked on 1 May 2023 after just four wins from 18 games. The side finished the season in 10th place.\nOn 8 May 2023, Michael Flynn was appointed team manager on a two-year contract, officially taking charge following the last match of the season that same day. Rob Angus stood down as CEO in September 2023. In January 2024, a 2\u20131 defeat at Crewe meant Swindon had lost ten of their last 15 matches, \nand Flynn was sacked as manager after just over eight months in charge. Appointed caretaker manager to the end of the season, Gavin Gunning questioned his players' \"heart\" after they won only two from ten games and dropped to 18th place in mid-March. Ultimately, the club finished the 2023\u20132024 season in 19th place and Swindon supporters called for a change in the club's ownership. Morfuni did not \"fully agree\" with the fans but acknowledged the last season had not been \"up to our club's standards\".\nKit and badge.\nCrest.\nSwindon Town have used at least five different kit badges since their inception. The original badge depicted a robin inside a shield with the letters STFC in the four corners, this changed to the \"steam train\" badge which was a coat of arms for the club based heavily on the coat of arms used by the local council. The \"steam train\" badge was in the form of a traditional shield, bisected with the club's name, a GWR steam locomotive (as Swindon is a railway town), a football and with a robin sitting on top. Beneath the shield was a motto on a scroll \u2013 \"Salubritas et Industria\" \u2013 meaning \"health and industry\". This motto is also that of the town of Swindon itself.\nDuring the 1970s the club changed the badge to one referred to as the \"ST arrow\" or \"traffic sign\" badge. This was circular and had the letters \"S\" and \"T\" interlocked, which both ends of the letter \"S\" being made into an arrow. Also shown was a simple football and the club name.\nFollowing the 1985\u201386 season, the \"steam train\" badge was re-introduced onto the kits. The crest was re-styled and the text \"Division Four Champions 1985/1986\" replaced the motto.\nA diamond shaped crest for Swindon Town was introduced at the beginning of the 1991\u201392 season following a series of financial problems for the club. The idea behind the new crest was to give the club a new fresh image.\n\"The 'travelling' football represents the club that is looking to the future with successful progress. The diamond shape clearly has the letter \"S\" (for Swindon) running through it, while a green section was also introduced to match a new 'green trim' on the team's home (red and white) shirts.\"\nOn 5 April 2007, the club unveiled plans to change the badge, claiming the diamond badge was correct for the time, but did not represent or show any of the club's heritage or history. Swindon offered fans the chance to vote on-line for the three new choices, which were all similar to the original steam train design, and a fourth option of keeping the 1991 design.\nOn 23 April 2007, it was announced that option three of the logo vote was the winner of the poll (it can be seen on the far right of the picture). Winning the vote with 68% in favour, the new badge includes the club name, a robin, a GWR steam locomotive \u2013 the rail industry being an important part of the Town's heritage \u2013 a football, and re-introduces the town's motto \u2013 'Salubritas et Industria'. It has been in use since the beginning of the 2007\u201308 season.\n Original home kit from 1879/80\u20131893/94\n 1894/95\u20131896/97 home kit\n \n 1897/98\u20131900/01 home kit\n 1901/02 home kit\n 1902/03 home kit\nHome kit.\nOriginally playing in black and white with the addition of blue sash for away games, the club changed to black and red quarters on entry to the Southern League in 1894. The club changed again in 1897 with the \"Swindon Advertiser\" reporting:\n\"The new colours of the Swindon Town F.C. are to be green shirts, with white sleeves. Good-bye to the old well known red and black.\"\nWith problems obtaining green dyes, the kit was short-lived and Swindon Town changed their shirts to the more familiar red in 1901. Initially a dark maroon, a lighter shade was chosen for the start of the 1902\u201303 season and also resulted in the club's nickname \"the Robins\" appearing in print for the first time in programme notes for the first game. The nickname is a reference to the former name of the European robin \u2013 \"redbreast\".\nSwindon Town have played their home games in variations on the red and white theme since then, wearing a red shirt with white collars and white or red shorts for much of their history which has led to the team being known as the \"Red and White Army\". For example; the kit worn during the 1985\u201386 Division Four Champions season consisted of a red shirt with white pinstripes, white shorts and red socks and chants of \"Lou Macari's Red and White Army\" were heard from the supporters at the final stages of the season.\nFollowing the rebranding of the club in 1991, green elements were re-introduced onto the home strip and badge to represent the team's short-lived kit from the turn of the century. These were removed in 2007.\nAway kit.\nThe club's away kits have only begun to change since the 1990s and the advent of the lucrative replica kit market. Swindon's first away kit (that was entirely separate to the home kit) consisted of an all-blue strip; this was not used for the club's 1969 League Cup Final victory where they elected to wear an all-white strip.\nFor a period in the 1980s the club changed their away kit to white shirts and black shorts and introduced a new third kit of yellow shirts and blue shorts. The club alternated between these two schemes as its away kit for the 1980s.\nWhen the club re-branded in the 1991 close season, it introduced a new away strip: the white and green \"potato print\" shirt with dark blue shorts. This remained in use until its replacement in 1993 with another yellow and blue strip, integrating the new colour scheme by adding a green collar.\nA special third kit was added for the 1996\u201397 season and was coloured \"petrol green\" in honour of sponsors Castrol.\nSwindon wore black and gold striped away shirts for the 2003\u201304 season with an all-white third kit, following this with variants on the blue theme until returning to all-white in 2007.\nIn 2008\u201309 they returned to the dark blue away kit that was used previously for the 2006\u201307 season but this time they had white shorts instead of a whole dark blue strip. In 2009\u201310 they returned once again to the all-white kit, but unlike the home kit, which showed \"FourFourTwo\" on the front, this showed \"FIFA10\" on the front as a part of sponsorship with EA. They also this year had an all-blue third kit which was featured for the FA Cup and also the play-off away game to Charlton.\nIn 2010\u201311 they had an all-black third kit. The all-black kit became the club's away kit for the 2011\u201312 season with an all-white kit as a third kit used for the FA Cup run. This kit caused controversy among some fans, because it had the sponsors \"The People\" printed on the shirts.\nFor 2012\u201313 they had a blue and yellow away kit, again controversial as these are the colours of Swindon's close rivals Oxford United.\nFor the 2021\u201322 season, they released a checkered gold and green kit. The colours of the Australia national team, paying homage to the new Australian owner Clem Morfuni. Later in the season they also released a special all black third kit. This included a darkened club badge, intended to signify the club coming \"out of the darkness\" following the take over of the new owner.\nShirt sponsors.\nThe current manufacturer is Adidas, restarting in 2024. From 2015 - 2024 Swindon's kit had been manufactured by Puma. Previous manufacturers include Umbro, Admiral, Adidas, Coffer Sports, Spall, Diamond Leisure, Loki, Mizuno, Lotto, Xara, DGI, Strikeforce, and Lonsdale. The club's shirt sponsors have included ISIS, Lowndes Lambert Group, GWR FM, Burmah, Castrol, Nationwide, Kingswood Group, FourFourTwo, Samsung, EA Sports FIFA, C&amp;D, Imagine Cruising, Bartercard, First City Nursing &amp; Care and MiPermit.\nStadium.\nSwindon Town's original pitch was located south of Bath Road, in the region of Bradford Road, adjacent to the Okus Quarry. After a young spectator fell into the quarry the team decided to move first to Lansdown Road and then to a pitch near The Croft where they were to remain for the next 11 years.\nSwindon Town have been playing at the County Ground since 1896. They played their games on the site of the adjacent cricket pitch also called the County Ground from 1893 until the ground opened.\nThomas Arkell of Arkell's Brewery donated \u00a3300 to finance the construction of a stand on what was then known as the 'Wiltshire County Ground', this investment was enough to begin development of a purpose-built football ground. Since its original construction, the ground has been periodically updated with new features or fittings. A cover on the Shrivenham Road side was erected in 1932, followed by the current roof at the Town End. This cost \u00a34,300, which was raised by the Supporters' Club, and was opened on 27 August 1938 by local MP, W.W. Wakefield.\nThe War Department took over the ground in 1940, where for a while POWs were housed in huts placed on the pitch. For this the club received compensation of \u00a34,570 in 1945.\nThe addition of floodlights in 1951 at a cost of \u00a3350, gave Swindon the honour of being the first League club to do so. These were first tried out \"v.\" Bristol City on 2 April 1951 beating Arsenal by six months.\nThese original set of lights were supplemented by lights on both side stand roofs, which were sufficient for the County Ground to stage its first floodlit league match on 29 February 1956 \"v.\" Millwall. (seven days after Fratton Park became the first ground to stage a floodlit league fixture). The present pylons date from 1960.\nThe ground currently contains elements constructed between 1950 and 1995, with the latest addition being the large sponsored stand on the south side. The County Ground is also the only football stadium in the world with a Rolex watch acting as its timekeeper, the clock on the Stratton Bank stand featuring its name was erected to celebrate promotion in 1963.\nThe ground itself was on land owned by Swindon Borough Council to which the club pays rent. Swindon had in the past considered a move to a club owned stadium to generate more revenue, but did not have the financial backing to do so. In 2006 a redevelopment campaign for the County Ground began, with the club and TrustSTFC (the supporters' trust) raising a petition to 'Save Our Home' urging the Borough Council to \"facilitate the redevelopment of the stadium and do everything they can to keep the club within the Borough\" including the proposed upgrading of the adjacent Cricket Club to County standard and Athletic Club to Olympic standard.\nOn 24 March 2023, Swindon Town bought the County Ground for \u00a32.3 million, as part of a joint venture with TrustSTFC, giving fans the opportunity to own a percentage of the Ground.\nSupporters.\nAs an expanding railway town, the club had attendances of up to 32,000 on match days until the early 1970s. Due to Swindon's low unemployment rate (one of the lowest in the United Kingdom), more people work in the town than live there and so are unlikely to support the team. In addition; poor team performances, the financial instability in the club and the change to an all-seated stadium following the Taylor Report have led to attendances at the County Ground dropping.\nWith an all-seated capacity of 15,728 at the County Ground, Swindon averaged a home attendance of 5,839 for the 2004\u201305 season. Only 37% of the grounds seats were occupied at a game on average.\nThis rose to 5,950 (37.8%) in 2005\u201306 and was reported as 7,109 (45.2%) for the 2006\u201307 season.\nA core group of fans has inhabited the Town End of the stadium since the 1980s, producing past fanzines such as \"The 69'er\", \"Bring the Noise\", \"Randy Robin\" and \"The Magic Roundabout\" amongst others. Supporters call the team The Town, The Reds, STFC and also the Red and White Army, the latter being a term the supporters use to identify themselves as well. The Junior Robins is the children's supporters club which operates to provide lower ticket prices, away game activities and transport to young fans. Membership of the club also allows them to be nominated as game mascot and gives them the opportunity to train in one of the many Football Schools run by the club.\nThe supporters' trust, TrustSTFC, was established in 2000. This organisation is a democratically elected group of fans who raise funds for the club and aim to give supporters access and input into decisions made by the club's board. The group run a number of schemes including the Loan Note Scheme, the aim of which is to buy shares in the club and assist with investment. Another scheme is the Red Army Fund; the money raised by this fund is given to the club to contribute towards the purchase and wages of new players. TrustSTFC also take part in the Fans' Consortium, which aims to place a supporter with a large stake-holding in the club onto the board of directors. The trust is also currently campaigning with the club for the re-development of the County Ground.\nThe \"Football Fever Report\" published by statisticians of the Littlewoods Football Pools was released in January 2007. It researched those teams that were the most stressful to support. Swindon Town was placed fifth out of all 92 League clubs, with the report stating \u2013\n\"It's only just over a decade ago that Swindon were a Premier League side, but the past 10 years have been tough going for fans at the County Ground. Relegation from the top flight in 1994 was followed by a second successive drop, and although promotion from Division Two was secured a year later, the team struggled in Division One in the next three seasons, finishing 19th, 18th and 17th. In 2000 came relegation, and a year later Swindon avoided another 'double relegation' by just one point. A glimmer of hope came when the play-offs were reached in 2004 \u2013 ending in a semi-final loss to Brighton \u2013 but last term Town became the first club to drop into the bottom tier of the Football League having once been in the Premier League. We bet Robins' fans can hardly believe it.\"\nWith the dwindling support during matches in the 2004\u201305 season, another fans' group, Red Army Loud and Proud was formed. It is a small group of fans attempting to bring back the atmosphere and fun to match days. With the stated aim of being \"the 12th man on the pitch\", the group sponsors players and also provides large colourful flags to the matches.\nHowever, in more recent years 2010\u201311 Swindon has rapidly increasing attendances with an 8,400 average attendance for the 2010\u201311 season despite relegation.\nHooliganism.\nSwindon Town has had problems with hooliganism since the 1970s, with the first known group being called the Swindon Town Aggro Boys (STAB). In a home game against Wrexham in March 1978, STAB were responsible for pelting the opposing goalkeeper with darts, stones and a golf ball. Club chairman Cecil Green later said: \"We intend to stamp out this thuggery. The incidents were diabolical.\" A new hooligan gang emerged in the 1980s, the Swindon Southside Firm (SSF), who were named after the area of terracing they occupied. In a match at Northampton Town, then manager Lou Macari walked straight into a group of more than 100 SSF members chasing Northampton fans up the street. Macari said the incident was \"worse than a Celtic\u2013Rangers game\".\nIn the 1990s, the Swindon Active Service (SAS) came to prominence and it is believed they were at the centre of several hostilities with fans of local rivals Oxford United and Reading . In September 1998, 19 SAS members were arrested at the home match with Oxford. A fracas at an away game versus AFC Bournemouth on 18 December 2004 resulted in the arrest of seventeen and the imposition of banning orders on those found to be guilty. The fighting, involving more than forty supporters, occurred in a busy shopping centre before the game. \"District Judge Roger House said it had been a 'frightening and terrifying' experience for scores of Christmas shoppers who witnessed the scenes.\"\nThe \"Swindon Advertiser\" reported that \"The area was packed with Christmas shoppers, who watched in horror as pub windows were smashed and fans traded insults.\"\nOn 16 December 2006, Swindon recorded one of their highest attendances of the season: 10,010 at a home win against rivals Bristol Rovers. The game was marred by supporter trouble which resulted in 11 arrests and saw an area of seating in the Arkell's Stand damaged, with the \"Western Daily Press\" reporting that \"the incident [...] ended with damage to 60 seats after they were used as missiles between opposing fans\". On the day of the return game in Bristol, 20 Rovers fans attacked a number of Swindon supporters with baseball bats at a local pub.\nNick Lowles, author of \"Hooligans 2: The M\u2013Z of Britain's Football Hooligan Gangs\", said: \"If you look at Swindon, the police have been very proactive in the last five years in terms of stopping hooliganism\".\nSwindon Town has imposed banning orders on those supporters who cause disruption, criminal damage or are violent when attending games. There were 29 banning orders in place in 2006, which was an increase from a total of 11 in 2005. The increase in banning orders has resulted in a reduction of arrests at games, with only 22 people being arrested attending games in 2005\u201306 compared to 39 arrests in 2004\u201305. Of the 22 arrests in 2005\u201306; 11 were for Public Disorder, five for violent disorder and the rest were made up of offences relating to missile throwing, racist chanting, pitch invasion, alcohol-related offences and one incident of being in possession of an offensive weapon. 33 Swindon fans were also banned from travelling to the 2006 FIFA World Cup. In 2013, 10 Swindon fans were charged with violent disorder following an incident outside the Royal Oak pub in Brentford before the club's League 1 play-off semi-final defeat.\nOn 23 November 2013 a Swindon fan was arrested after running onto the pitch and punching Leyton Orient's goalkeeper, Jamie Jones.\nOn 10 October 2023, Swindon Town met rivals Reading in an EFL Trophy game for their first competitive fixture in over 21 years. After the game, fighting broke out between the two sets of fans, leading to four arrests by the Thames Valley Police.\nRivalries.\nMany clubs share either minor or more major rivalries with Swindon. In 2013 a poll of supporters of all Football League clubs to find out which teams they see as their main rivals was conducted by the Football Fans Census, the results of which put Swindon in joint 4th place on the list of teams with the most rivals. This result was calculated by ranking clubs on how many supporters of other clubs viewed others as first, second, and third rivals.\nSwindon Town's fiercest rivals are Oxford United, with whom they contest the A420 derby. This bitterly contested fixture has been marred with controversial and violent events both on and off the pitch over the years and the hatred has also been known to extend to other sports including speedway, with both riders and fans getting into regular scuffles over the years. As of 2025 the sides have met 62 times in all competitions, with Swindon winning 25, Oxford winning 17, and 20 games ending in a draw.\nSwindon Town fans are referred to by their rivals as \"moonrakers\", though in Wiltshire this isn't seen as an insult.\nReading are also seen by many Swindon fans as a major rival, however this rivalry has become less intense over the years with both teams being in different divisions and not playing each other for a period of over 21 years. The rivalries between Swindon, Reading, and Oxford were labelled as the \"Didcot Triangle\" (owing to the train station which lies at the centre of the 3 locations) when the sides shared the same division in 2001, however the rivalry between Swindon Town and Oxford United is generally regarded as being by far the most intense, with both teams fans viewing each other as main rivals in the most recent polls. This is because Swindon and Oxford have spent most of their history in higher divisions than Reading, and recently in lower divisions than Reading, and Reading's traditional biggest rivalry is with Aldershot.\nAdditionally, Swindon share historical rivalries with Bristol City and Bristol Rovers. The rivalry with Bristol City was most recently relevant in the 2014/15 season where both clubs were fighting for promotion to the Championship, with former Swindon defender Aden Flint causing outrage via an interview conducted after Bristol City's decisive 3-0 win over Swindon at Ashton Gate in the closing part of the season. Swindon last shared a division with Bristol Rovers in the 2021/22 season, with Swindon playing under Bristol Rovers' former manager Ben Garner. The rivalries with the Bristol clubs tend to be felt more strongly by people in areas of West Wiltshire, where the catchment for the club's fanbases overlaps.\nOther more minor rivalries exist with multiple clubs, the most notable of which being with Gillingham. This rivalry stems from an ill tempered match in the 1978/79 season where both teams were vying for promotion from the old Third Division, during which the referee was assaulted by a fan, multiple players ended up in court after a fight in the tunnel, and fan violence erupted on the terraces. Newport County have also emerged as a minor rivalry during Swindon's recent stay in League 2, with occasional trouble occurring whenever the two teams meet. Gloucestershire teams Cheltenham Town and Forest Green Rovers also consider Swindon a local rival, however this is not very often reciprocated as strongly by Swindon fans, due to the clubs not historically playing competitively at the same level. Other West Country clubs including Plymouth Argyle and Exeter City have also been labelled as derbies by fans and the media.\nSwindon Town Women F.C..\nSwindon Town Ladies FC were established on 28 September 1993, after breaking away from the established Swindon Spitfires Women's and Girls' Football Club, while they rebranded to Swindon Town Women in July 2019. The current Swindon Town Women Football Club (STWFC) first team play in the FA Women's National League South West Division 1. Swindon Town Women currently play their home games at Foundation Park and the County Ground. In April 2023 the club officially came under the main Club umbrella with their first actions to replace the management team of the First and Development sides, while folding their U18s.\n \"As of 31 October 2025\".\nPlayers.\nFirst team squad.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Football squad player/styles.css\" /&gt;\n\"For recent transfers, see 2025\u201326 Swindon Town F.C. season.\"\nOut on loan.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Football squad player/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReserves and Academy.\n\"For further information: Swindon Town F.C.

Danny Williams and Andy King are the only men to have been given the job on a permanent basis twice.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nPlayer awards and recognition.\nSwindon Town Hall of Fame (as of 2023[ [update]]).\nOn 15 December 2011, local newspaper the \"Swindon Advertiser\" announced that the club were to launch the Swindon Town Hall of Fame. Former players Don Rogers, John Trollope and Paul Bodin were the first three confirmed inductees with the others announced during a BBC Wiltshire radio broadcast on 30 December 2011.\nEnglish Football Hall of Fame.\n\"The following have either played for or managed Swindon Town and have been inducted into the English Football Hall of Fame\"\nStatistics and records.\nJohn Trollope holds the record for Swindon Town appearances, having played 889 first-team matches between 1960 and 1980. Trollope also holds the English Football League Record of most appearances by a player at one club, having played in 770 League games. Central defender Maurice Owen comes second, having played 601 times. The record for a goalkeeper is held by Sam Burton, who is third with 509 appearances.\nHarry Morris holds all of Swindon's goal records, having scored 229 goals for the club between 1926 and 1933. Harold Fleming is second with 203, with Don Rogers third with 178. Morris scored the most goals in a season with 48 during 1926\u201327, 47 of which were in League games which is another club record. The most goals scored by an individual is also held by Morris and Keith East, who have both scored 5 against League opposition (Morris having achieved this in 1926 and 1930).\nThe highest attendance at the County Ground of 32,000 was recorded on 15 January 1972 in a FA Cup third round match against Arsenal. The capacity of the ground is now 15,728 so it is unlikely that this record will be broken in the foreseeable future.\nSwindon Town have also set records in English football, being the second team (after York City in 1983\u201384) to score over 100 points in the League when they became Fourth Division champions in 1985\u201386. The total of 102 that the club scored has since been beaten. They also hold the Premier League record for most goals conceded in a season, 100 in 1993\u201394, though several teams have finished with a lower points tally.\nOn 20 February 2007 the club played in a landmark League game away to Barnet, a 1\u20130 loss. The completion of this match meant that Swindon had, during their history, played a League game at home and away against every team who, in the 2006\u201307 season, 2011\u201312 season and 2019\u201320 season, were in the Premier League, Championship, League One and League Two but not the National League.\nHonours.\nLeague\nCup\nReferences.\nGeneral\nSpecific\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The film stars Julia Roberts and Brad Pitt, with James Gandolfini, Bob Balaban, J. K. Simmons, and Gene Hackman in supporting roles.\nIt tells the story of a small-time criminal (Pitt) who is sent on a mission to retrieve an antique pistol in Mexico, while his girlfriend (Roberts), frustrated with their troubled relationship, finds herself entangled in a series of unexpected events.\n\"The Mexican\" was released in the United States on March 2, 2001, to mixed reviews from critics, and grossed $147.8 million.\nPlot.\nIn Los Angeles, a traffic light changes to red, and off-screen sounds of an automobile collision are heard.\nFive years later, Jerry Welbach has been working off a debt to imprisoned mob boss Arnold Margolese. After Jerry fouls up what was supposed to be his final errand, Margolese's second-in-command, Bernie Nayman, sends Jerry on a new, final errand: retrieving an antique pistol in Mexico for Margolese from a man named Beck. This additional job proves to be the last straw for Jerry's girlfriend, Sam, who leaves him to move to Las Vegas.\nIn Mexico, Jerry finds the pistol with Beck, who explains the history of the legendary gun, known as \"the Mexican\". When Beck is killed by a stray bullet from celebratory gunfire, Jerry calls his colleague Ted and learns that Beck was Margolese's grandson. Just then, Jerry's car is stolen, with Beck's body and the pistol inside. Jerry recovers the car and the gun, shooting one of the thieves in the foot and burying the body.\nWhile Sam is traveling to Las Vegas, a well-dressed hitman attempts to abduct her but is shot by another hitman who captures her instead. The second hitman introduces himself as Leroy and explains that he was hired to hold Sam hostage to ensure Jerry delivers the pistol.\nSam explains to Leroy that Jerry became indebted to Margolese five years earlier after crashing into Margolese's car while running a red light. At the accident site, the police discovered someone tied up in Margolese's trunk whom he intended to kill. Margolese was sent to prison for five years, and Jerry was forced to run errands for Margolese during that time. Bonding with Leroy, Sam correctly deduces that he is gay and encourages him to pick up Frank, a traveling postal worker. The three of them reach Las Vegas, and Leroy and Frank spend the night together.\nIn Mexico, Jerry is briefly arrested after a police officer notices Beck's blood in his car. Confiscating the pistol, the officer elaborates on its cursed history and takes it to a pawn shop. Ted arrives and reveals that the infamous Leroy has been sent after Sam. Jerry overhears a call with Nayman ordering Ted to kill him. They recover the pistol from the pawn shop, but Jerry confronts Ted and leaves with the gun. Realizing he grabbed Ted's passport instead of his own, he returns to find Ted has already fled.\nIn Las Vegas, the well-dressed hitman murders the innocent Frank and returns for Sam but is killed by a vengeful Leroy. Sam and Leroy fly to Mexico to meet Jerry, who crashes the car in an argument with Sam. Leroy finds the pistol and prepares to kill Jerry, but Jerry kills him first. He explains to a distraught Sam that Leroy was an imposter\u2014his driver's license reveals he is actually Winston Baldry\u2014and that Jerry once met the real Leroy, the well-dressed black hitman. Jerry realizes that Margolese hired the real Leroy, but Nayman sent Baldry to intercept Sam and the pistol, allowing him to sell it himself and frame Jerry.\nSam and Jerry prepare to go their separate ways, but Sam remembers Baldry's advice to never give up when you truly love someone and reconciles with Jerry. Soon afterward, Jerry is kidnapped by the thieves who stole his car. He is brought to Margolese, newly released from prison, who explains the true story of the pistol: it was crafted by a gunsmith for his daughter's marriage to a nobleman's cruel son, but the daughter and the gunsmith's assistant were truly in love. When the gun refused to fire for the nobleman's son, he killed the assistant, leading the daughter to take her own life with the pistol.\nIt is revealed that Margolese's cellmate was the gunsmith's great-grandson; he was killed protecting Margolese, who swore to return the pistol to his cellmate's father. Jerry agrees to give him the pistol, but Nayman kidnaps Sam. A Mexican standoff ensues until Sam kills Nayman with the pistol. The shot dislodges a ring from the gun barrel, which Jerry uses to propose to Sam. The Mexican pistol is restored to the gunsmith's family, as Jerry and Sam drive off together.\nCast.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nProduction.\nPre-production.\nThe script was originally meant for an independent film without major movie stars. However, Julia Roberts and Brad Pitt had for some time been looking for a project to do together, and after Roberts introduced the script to Pitt, they both agreed to star in it. Roberts also suggested casting James Gandolfini, in what went on to be regarded as one of his greatest roles.\nKevin Reynolds and David Fincher were both considered to direct the film. However, Reynolds turned it down because the cast was not confirmed, while Fincher was unavailable due to his prior commitments with the release of \"Fight Club\" (1999). Additionally, Ben Stiller and Meg Ryan had also expressed interest in playing the lead roles in the film.\nFilming.\n\"The Mexican\" was filmed in Real de Catorce, San Luis Potos\u00ed, and Toluca International Airport in Toluca, State of Mexico, as well as various locations in Las Vegas, Nevada, and Los Angeles, California.\nReception.\nBox office.\n\"The Mexican\" debuted at #1 at the North American box office ahead of \"Hannibal\" and \"See Spot Run\", earning $20.1 million in its opening weekend. Despite a 39% decline in the following week, the film retained the top spot for a second consecutive week. By the end of its theatrical run, \"The Mexican\" had grossed $147.8 million worldwide.\nCritical reception.\n\"The Mexican\" holds a 54% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 133 reviews, with an average rating of 5.6/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \"Though \"The Mexican\" makes a good attempt at originality, its ponderous length makes it wear out its welcome. Also, those looking forward to seeing Roberts and Pitt paired up may end up disappointed, as they are kept apart for most of the movie.\" On Metacritic, the film has a score of 43 out of 100, based on 35 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews.\" Additionally, audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"C\" on an A+ to F scale.\nThe \"Cedar Rapids Gazette\" praised the film, stating, \"The scenes between Roberts and Gandolfini make the film special. ... Their dialogue scenes are the best reason to see the film.\"\nThe \"Doylestown Intelligencer\" remarked, \"Pitt and Roberts are good too \u2013 maybe better like this than if they were together. ... If it had been a Pitt/Roberts two-hander, there wouldn't have been room for Gandolfini's wonderful character, and that would have been a shame.\"\nThe \"Titusville Herald\" commented, \"\"The Mexican\" is sporadically entertaining. It works when Gandolfini is on screen; when he leaves, he takes the movie with him. ... From here, director Gore Verbinski intercuts between two road movies, one of which (the one with Pitt) is downright boring.\"\nThe \"Edmonton Journal\" observed, \"Moviegoers who have seen \"The Mexican\" aren't coming out of cinemas talking about the romantic chemistry between Julia Roberts and Brad Pitt. They're talking about the presence of tough guy James Gandolfini in the unlikely role of a gay hitman named Leroy.\"\nThe \"Walla Walla Union-Bulletin\" stated, \"Roberts and Pitt are generally terrific. In \"The Mexican\" they are horrid. ... Gandolfini is a star on the rise. His work in \"The Mexican\" is solid. Frankly, he's the only bright spot in this dark and pointless movie.\"\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "74296", "revid": "50675421", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=74296", "title": "The Last Temptation of Christ (novel)", "text": "1955 historical novel by Nikos Kazantzakis\nThe Last Temptation of Christ or The Last Temptation (Greek: , \"O Teleft\u00e9os Pirasm\u00f3s\") is a historical novel written by Nikos Kazantzakis, first published in its original Greek in 1955 before being translated into English in 1960. The novel depicts the life of Jesus and his struggles with various forms of temptation, including fear, doubt, depression, reluctance, and lust.\nUpon its publication, the book was condemned by the Catholic Church and the Greek Orthodox Church; it has since been challenged by numerous Christian groups and conservative organizations. The 1988 film adaptation directed by Martin Scorsese was similarly controversial.\nPlot.\nThe novel opens with Jesus in the desert, wrestling with his divine calling and the knowledge of his imminent death. Throughout the book, Jesus grapples with his human desires and the temptation to lead a normal life, away from the suffering and sacrifice that he knows awaits him. Despite his reservations, Jesus decides to follow through with his mission, ultimately leading to his arrest, trial, and crucifixion.\nHowever, the climax of the novel takes a different turn as Jesus is shown dying on the cross, only to awaken in a vision of a world where he did not die and instead lived a long, normal life with Mary Magdalene as his wife after choosing to abandon his calling. In this world, Jesus experiences love, pain, and suffering just as any other human being would.\nAs he lives out his life in this alternate world, Jesus begins to question whether or not his divine mission was worth all of the suffering that he went through. Eventually, he realizes that though he would have been content with living as a normal man, his death is rendered meaningless, and his teachings forgotten. Accepting that his destiny is to sacrifice himself for the sake of humanity, Jesus willingly returns to his fate as the son of God.\nThe novel concludes with Jesus ascending to heaven, leaving behind a legacy of love, sacrifice, and redemption.\nThemes.\nKazantzakis argues in the novel's preface that by facing and conquering all of man's weaknesses, Jesus struggled to do God's will without ever giving in to the temptations of the flesh. The novel advances the argument that, had Jesus succumbed to any such temptation, especially the opportunity to save himself from the cross, his life would have held no more significance than that of any other philosopher.\nThe critic I. A. Richards has stated that Kazantzakis' novel tries to reclaim the values of early Christianity, such as love, brotherhood, humility, and self-renunciation. According to the book's English translator, Peter A. Bien, the psychology in \"The Last Temptation\" is based on the idea that every person, Jesus included, is evil by nature as well as good, violent and hateful as well as loving. A psychologically sound individual does not ignore or bury the evil within him. Instead, he channels it into the service of good.\nMartin Scorsese, director of the 1988 film adaptation, formulated that Kazantzakis didn't doubt the divine nature of Jesus, noting, \"The beauty of Kazantzakis' concept is that Jesus has to put up with everything we go through, all the doubts and fears and anger. He made me feel like he's sinning\u2014but he's not sinning, he\u2019s just human. As well as divine. And he has to deal with all this double, triple guilt on the cross.\"\nControversy.\nIn February 1955, the Holy Synod of the Greek Orthodox Church in Athens attempted to have all of Kazantzakis' books banned in Greece, arguing that \"The Last Temptation of Christ\" \"contains evil slanders against the Godlike person of Jesus Christ. \u2026 derived from the inspiration of the theories of Freud and historical materialism, [this book] perverts and hurts the Gospel discernment and the God-man figure of our Lord Jesus Christ in a way coarse, vulgar, and blasphemous.\" A campaign was also started in the Greek Orthodox Church to excommunicate Kazantzakis, which ultimately failed, but he was denied normal funeral rites upon his death.\nIn 1963, a Roman Catholic priest in Ashland, Wisconsin, forbade one of his parishioners from returning a library copy of \"The Last Temptation of Christ\", arguing \"that it would be a mortal sin to make it available to others.\" In 1964, a conservative group called the Citizens Group for Clean Books demanded that the novel be removed from public libraries in Arcadia, California, on the basis that it was \"blasphemous, obscene and defamatory\"; as a result, the book was made \"available on a limited basis to persons over the age of 18.\"\nThe book was banned in Singapore in 1988.\nAdaptations.\nFilm version.\nThe director Sidney Lumet acquired the film rights to Kazantzakis' novel, describing it as the story \"of how a man pushes himself to extremes he never knew he was capable of,\" with Judas emerging \"as a strong man, a sort of hero\". Lumet commissioned a screenplay written by Lazarre Seymour Simckes and announced his plans to shoot the film in the fall of 1971, though the project did not come to fruition. After many delays, a film version directed by Martin Scorsese was released in 1988, starring Willem Dafoe as Jesus, Barbara Hershey as Mary Magdalene, and Harvey Keitel as Judas Iscariot.\nPlay version.\nA drama based on \"The Last Temptation of Christ\", named \"Christuvinte Aaram Thirumurivu\" ('The Sixth Holy Wound of Christ'), written by P. M. Antony and depicting Jesus as a mere good-hearted man instead of the Son of God, was staged in India's state of Kerala. On 10 August 1986, the play debuted in Alappuzha. It was performed about 42 times, but the Church had taken offence, and at every performance, demonstrations including premeditated violence against the play and the playwright were instigated. The police even confiscated the script; the state went on to ban the play, and courts did not overturn the ban. Antony went on to publish the play in print in the Malayalam language; eventually he was arrested and punished on unrelated charges.\nIn popular culture.\nThe American singer-songwriter Judee Sill referred to Kazantzakis as her favorite writer; her 1971 song \"Jesus Was a Cross Maker\" was inspired by the depiction of Jesus in \"The Last Temptation of Christ\".\nIn a 1988 private concert filmed at a Holiday Inn in Houston, American country singer-songwriter Townes Van Zandt cited \"The Last Temptation of Christ\" as the inspiration behind his 1970 song \"Nothin\"; Van Zandt claimed to have written the lyrics the same night he finished reading the book, acknowledging \"the big controversy goin' on\" surrounding Kazantzakis' work at the time.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

AD)\nThe Xiongnu (, ) were a tribal confederation of nomadic peoples who, according to ancient Chinese sources, inhabited the eastern Eurasian Steppe from the 3rd century BC to the late 1st century AD. Modu Chanyu, the supreme leader after 209\u00a0BC, founded the Xiongnu Empire.\nAfter overthrowing their previous overlords, the Yuezhi, the Xiongnu became the dominant power on the steppes of East Asia, centred on the Mongolian Plateau. The Xiongnu were also active in areas now part of Siberia, Inner Mongolia, Gansu and Xinjiang. Their relations with the Chinese dynasties to the south-east were complex\u2014alternating between various periods of peace, war, and subjugation. Ultimately, the Xiongnu were defeated by the Han dynasty in a centuries-long conflict, which led to the confederation splitting in two, and forcible resettlement of large numbers of Xiongnu within Han borders. During the Sixteen Kingdoms era, listed as one of the \"Five Barbarians\", their descendants founded the dynastic states of Han-Zhao, Northern Liang and Helian Xia and during the Northern and Southern dynasties founded Northern Zhou (founded by members of the Yuwen tribe of Xiongnu origin) in northern China.\nAttempts to associate the Xiongnu with the nearby Sakas and Sarmatians were once controversial. However, archaeogenetics has confirmed their interaction with the Xiongnu, and also possibly their relation to the Huns. The identity of the ethnic core of Xiongnu has been a subject of varied hypotheses, because only a few words, mainly titles and personal names, were preserved in the Chinese sources. The name \"Xiongnu\" may be cognate with that of the Huns or the Huna, although this is disputed. Other linguistic links\u2014all of them also controversial\u2014proposed by scholars include Turkic, Iranian, Mongolic, Uralic, Yeniseian, or multi-ethnic.\nName.\nThe word \"Xi\u014dngn\u00fa\" means \"fierce slave\". They were identified by the Han Chinese as invaders from the north who rode on horseback. The pronunciation of as Xi\u014dngn\u00fa is the modern Mandarin Chinese pronunciation, from the Mandarin dialect spoken now in Beijing, which came into existence only in the second millennium CE. The Old Chinese pronunciation has been reconstructed as *\"xiuo\u014b-na\" or as *\"qho\u014bna\" according to Wang Li and Zhengzhang Shangfang respectively, the two most widely recognized Old Chinese reconstructions in China. Sinologist Axel Schuessler (2014) reconstructs the pronunciations of as *\"ho\u014b-n\u00e2\" in Late Old Chinese (c.\u2009318 BC) and as *\"h\u0268o\u014b-n\u0251\" in Eastern Han Chinese; citing other Chinese transcriptions wherein the velar nasal medial \"-\u014b-\", after a short vowel, seemingly played the role of a general nasal \u2013 sometimes equivalent to \"n\" or \"m\" \u2013, Schuessler proposes that Xiongnu &lt; *\"h\u0268o\u014b-n\u0251\" &lt; *\"ho\u014b-n\u00e2\" might be a Chinese rendition, Han or even pre-Han, of foreign *\"H\u014fna\" or *\"H\u016dna\", which Schuessler compares to Huns and Sanskrit \"H\u016b\u1e47\u0101\". However, the same medial \"-\u014b-\" prompts Christopher P. Atwood (2015) to reconstruct *\"Xo\u014bai\", which he derives from the Ongi River () in Mongolia and suggests that it was originally a dynastic name rather than an ethnic name.\nHistory.\nPredecessors.\nEarly Indo-European migrations from the Pontic steppes and across Central Asia, and encounter with Ancient Northeast Asian populations.\nThe territories associated with the Xiongnu in central/east Mongolia were previously inhabited by the Slab Grave Culture (Ancient Northeast Asian origin), which persisted until the 3rd century BC. Genetic research indicates that the Slab Grave people were the primary ancestors of the Xiongnu, and that the Xiongnu formed through substantial and complex mixture with West Eurasians.\nDuring the Western Zhou (1045\u2013771 BC), there were numerous conflicts with nomadic tribes from the north and the northwest, variously known as the Xianyun, Guifang, or various \"Rong\" tribes, such as the Xirong, Shanrong or Quanrong. These tribes are recorded as harassing Zhou territory, but at the time the Zhou were expanding northwards, encroaching on their traditional lands, especially into the Wei River valley. Archaeologically, the Zhou expanded to the north and the northwest at the expense of the Siwa culture. The Quanrong put an end to the Western Zhou in 771 BC, sacking the Zhou capital of Haojing and killing the last Western Zhou king You. Thereafter the task of dealing with the northern tribes was left to their vassal, the Qin state.\nTo the west, the Pazyryk culture (6th\u20133rd century BC) immediately preceded the formation of the Xiongnus. A Scythian culture, it was identified by excavated artifacts and mummified humans, such as the Siberian Ice Maiden, found in the Siberian permafrost, in the Altai Mountains, Kazakhstan and nearby Mongolia. To the south, the Ordos culture had developed in the Ordos Loop (modern Inner Mongolia, China) during the Bronze and early Iron Age from the 6th to 2nd centuries BC. Of unknown ethno-linguistic origin, it is thought to represent the easternmost extension of Indo-European-speakers. The Yuezhi were displaced by the Xiongnu expansion in the 2nd century BC, and had to migrate to Central and Southern Asia.\nEarly history.\nWestern Han historian Sima Qian composed an early yet detailed exposition on the Xiongnu in one \"liezhuan\" (arrayed account) of his \"Records of the Grand Historian\" (c.\u2009100 BC), wherein the Xiongnu were alleged to be descendants of a certain Chunwei, who in turn descended from the \"lineage of Lord Xia\", a.k.a. Yu the Great. Even so, Sima Qian also drew a distinct line between the settled Huaxia people (Han) to the pastoral nomads (Xiongnu), characterizing them as two polar groups in the sense of a civilization versus an uncivilized society: the Hua\u2013Yi distinction. Sima Qian also mentioned Xiongnu's early appearance north of Wild Goose Gate and Dai commanderies before 265 BC, just before the Zhao-Xiongnu War; however, sinologist Edwin Pulleyblank (1994) contends that pre-241-BC references to the Xiongnu are anachronistic substitutions for the Hu people instead. Sometimes the Xiongnu were distinguished from other nomadic peoples; namely, the Hu people; yet on other occasions, Chinese sources often just classified the Xiongnu as a \"Hu\" people, which was a blanket term for nomadic people. Even Sima Qian was inconsistent: in the chapter \"Hereditary House of Zhao\", he considered the Donghu to be the Hu proper, yet elsewhere he considered Xiongnu to be also Hu.\nAncient China often came in contact with the Xianyun and the Xirong nomadic peoples. In later Chinese historiography, some groups of these peoples were believed to be the possible progenitors of the Xiongnu people. These nomadic people often had repeated military confrontations with the Shang and especially the Zhou, who often conquered and enslaved the nomads in an expansion drift. During the Warring States period, the armies from the Qin, Zhao and Yan states were encroaching and conquering various nomadic territories that were inhabited by the Xiongnu and other Hu peoples.\nPulleyblank argued that the Xiongnu were part of a Xirong group called Yiqu, who had lived in Shaanbei and had been influenced by China for centuries, before they were driven out by the Qin dynasty. Qin's campaign against the Xiongnu expanded Qin's territory at the expense of the Xiongnu. After the unification of Qin dynasty, Xiongnu was a threat to the northern border of Qin. They were likely to attack the Qin dynasty when they suffered natural disasters.\nState formation.\nThe first known Xiongnu leader was Touman, who reigned between 220 and 209 BC. In 215 BC, Chinese Emperor Qin Shi Huang sent General Meng Tian on a military campaign against the Xiongnu. Meng Tian defeated the Xiongnu and expelled them from the Ordos Loop, forcing Touman and the Xiongnu to flee north into the Mongolian Plateau. In 210 BC, Meng Tian died, and in 209 BC, Touman's son Modu became the Xiongnu \"chanyu\".\nIn order to protect the Xiongnu from the threat of the Qin dynasty, Modu Chanyu united the Xiongnu into a powerful confederation. This transformed the Xiongnu into a more formidable polity, able to form larger armies and exercise improved strategic coordination. The Qin dynasty fell in 207 BC, and was replaced by the Western Han dynasty in 202 BC after a period of internal conflict. This period of Chinese instability was a time of prosperity for the Xiongnu, who adopted many Han agriculture techniques such as slaves for heavy labor and lived in Han-style homes.\nAfter forging internal unity, Modu Chanyu expanded the Xiongnu empire in all directions. To the north he conquered a number of nomadic peoples, including the Dingling of southern Siberia. He crushed the power of the Donghu people of eastern Mongolia and Manchuria as well as the Yuezhi in the Hexi Corridor of Gansu, where his son, Jizhu, made a skull cup out of the Yuezhi king. Modu also retook the original homeland of Xiongnu on the Yellow River, which had previously been taken by the Qin general Meng Tian. Under Modu's leadership, the Xiongnu became powerful enough to threaten the Han dynasty.\nIn 200 BC, Modu besieged the first Han dynasty emperor Gaozu (Gao-Di) with his 320,000-strong army at Peteng Fortress in Baideng (present-day Datong, Shanxi). After Gaozu (Gao-Di) agreed to all Modu's terms, such as ceding the northern provinces to the Xiongnu and paying annual taxes, he was allowed to leave the siege. Although Gaozu was able to return to his capital Chang'an (present-day Xi'an), Modu occasionally threatened the Han's northern frontier and finally in 198 BC, a peace treaty was settled.\nXiongnu in their expansion drove their western neighbour Yuezhi from the Hexi Corridor in year 176 BC, killing the Yuezhi king and asserting their presence in the Western Regions.\nBy the time of Modu's death in 174 BC, the Xiongnu were recognized as the most prominent of the nomads bordering the Han empire According to the \"Book of Han\", later quoted in Duan Chengshi's ninth-century \"Miscellaneous Morsels from Youyang\":\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Also, according to the \"Han shu\", Wang Wu (\u738b\u70cf) and others were sent as envoys to pay a visit to the Xiongnu. According to the customs of the Xiongnu, if the Han envoys did not remove their tallies of authority, and if they did not allow their faces to be tattooed, they could not gain entrance into the yurts. Wang Wu and his company removed their tallies, submitted to tattoo, and thus gained entry. The Shanyu looked upon them very highly.\nXiongnu hierarchy.\nThe ruler of the Xiongnu was called the \"chanyu\". Under him were the tuqi kings. The Tuqi King of the Left was normally the heir presumptive. Below him in the hierarchy were more officials in pairs of left and right: the \"guli\", the army commanders, the great governors, the \"danghu\" and the \"gudu\". Beneath them were the commanders of detachments of one thousand, of one hundred, and of ten men. This nation of nomads, was organized like an army.\nAfter Modu, later leaders formed a dualistic system of political organisation with the left and right branches of the Xiongnu divided on a regional basis. The \"chanyu\" or \"shanyu\", a ruler equivalent to the Emperor of China, exercised direct authority over the central territory. Longcheng (around the Khangai Mountains, Otuken) (Chinese: \u9f8d\u57ce; Mongolian: Luut; lit. \"Dragon City\") became the annual meeting place and served as the Xiongnu capital. The ruins of Longcheng were found south of Ulziit District, Arkhangai Province in 2017.\nNorth of Shanxi with the Tuqi King of the Left was holding the area north of Beijing and the Tuqi King of the Right was holding the Ordos Loop area as far as Gansu.\nMarriage diplomacy with Han dynasty.\nIn the winter of 200 BC, following a Xiongnu siege of Taiyuan, Emperor Gaozu of Han personally led a military campaign against Modu Chanyu. At the Battle of Baideng, he was ambushed, reputedly by Xiongnu cavalry. The emperor was cut off from supplies and reinforcements for seven days, only narrowly escaping capture.\nThe Han dynasty sent commoner women falsely labeled as \"princesses\" and members of the Han imperial family to the Xiongnu multiple times when they were practicing Heqin () marriage alliances with the Xiongnu in order to avoid sending the emperor's daughters. The Han sent these \"princesses\" to marry Xiongnu leaders in their efforts to stop the border raids. Along with arranged marriages, the Han sent gifts to bribe the Xiongnu to stop attacking. After the defeat at Pingcheng in 200 BC, the Han emperor abandoned a military solution to the Xiongnu threat. Instead, in 198 BC, the courtier Liu Jing was dispatched for negotiations. The peace settlement eventually reached between the parties included a Han princess given in marriage to the \"chanyu\"; periodic gifts to the Xiongnu of silk, distilled beverages and rice; equal status between the states; and a boundary wall as a mutual border.\nThis first treaty set the pattern for relations between the Han and the Xiongnu for sixty years. Up to 135\u00a0BC, the treaty was renewed nine times, each time with an increase in the \"gifts\" to the Xiongnu Empire. In 192\u00a0BC, Modun even asked for the hand of Emperor Gaozu of Han widow Empress L\u00fc Zhi. His son and successor, the energetic Jiyu, known as Laoshang Chanyu, continued his father's expansionist policies. Laoshang succeeded in negotiating terms with Emperor Wen for the maintenance of a large scale government sponsored market system.\nWhile the Xiongnu benefited handsomely, from the Chinese perspective marriage treaties were costly, very humiliating and ineffective. Laoshang Chanyu showed that he did not take the peace treaty seriously. On one occasion his scouts penetrated to a point near Chang'an. In 166 BC he personally led 140,000 cavalry to invade Anding, reaching as far as the imperial retreat at Yong. In 158 BC, his successor sent 30,000 cavalry to attack Shangdang and another 30,000 to Yunzhong.\nThe Xiongnu also practiced marriage alliances with Han dynasty officers and officials who defected to their side by marrying off sisters and daughters of the \"chanyu\" to Han Chinese who joined the Xiongnu and Xiongnu in Han service. The daughter of Laoshang Chanyu (and older sister of Junchen Chanyu and Yizhixie Chanyu) was married to the Xiongnu General Zhao Xin, the Marquis of Xi who was serving the Han dynasty. The daughter of Qiedihou Chanyu was married to the Han Chinese General Li Ling after he surrendered and defected. Another Han Chinese General who defected to the Xiongnu was Li Guangli, a general in the War of the Heavenly Horses, who also married a daughter of the Hulugu Chanyu. The Han Chinese diplomat Su Wu married a Xiongnu woman given by Li Ling when he was arrested and taken captive. Han Chinese explorer Zhang Qian married a Xiongnu woman and had a child with her when he was taken captive by the Xiongnu.\nThe khagans of the Yenisei Kyrgyz Khaganate claimed descent from the Chinese general Li Ling, grandson of the Han dynasty general Li Guang. Li Ling was captured by the Xiongnu and defected in the first century BC. And since the Tang royal Li family also claimed descent from Li Guang, the Kirghiz Khagan was therefore recognized as a member of the Tang Imperial family. This relationship soothed the relationship when Kyrgyz khagan Are (\u963f\u71b1) invaded Uyghur Khaganate and executed Qasar Qaghan. The news brought to Chang'an by Kyrgyz ambassador Zhuwu Hesu (\u8a3b\u543e\u5408\u7d20).\nHan\u2013Xiongnu war.\nThe Han dynasty made preparations for war when the Han Emperor Wu dispatched the Han Chinese explorer Zhang Qian to explore the mysterious kingdoms to the west and to form an alliance with the Yuezhi people in order to combat the Xiongnu. During this time Zhang married a Xiongnu wife, who bore him a son, and gained the trust of the Xiongnu leader. While Zhang Qian did not succeed in this mission, his reports of the west provided even greater incentive to counter the Xiongnu hold on westward routes out of the Han Empire, and the Han prepared to mount a large scale attack using the Northern Silk Road to move men and material.\nWhile the Han dynasty had been making preparations for a military confrontation since the reign of Emperor Wen, the break did not come until 133 BC, following an abortive trap to ambush the \"Chanyu\" at Mayi. By that point the empire was consolidated politically, militarily and economically, and was led by an adventurous pro-war faction at court. In that year, Emperor Wu reversed the decision he had made the year before to renew the peace treaty.\nFull-scale war broke out in late 129 BC, when 40,000 Han cavalry made a surprise attack on the Xiongnu at the border markets. In 127 BC, the Han general Wei Qing retook the Ordos. In 121 BC, the Xiongnu suffered another setback when Huo Qubing led a force of light cavalry westward out of Longxi and within six days fought his way through five Xiongnu kingdoms. The Xiongnu Hunye king was forced to surrender with 40,000 men. In 119 BC both Huo and Wei, each leading 50,000 cavalrymen and 100,000 footsoldiers (in order to keep up with the mobility of the Xiongnu, many of the non-cavalry Han soldiers were mobile infantrymen who traveled on horseback but fought on foot), and advancing along different routes, forced the \"Chanyu\" and his Xiongnu court to flee north of the Gobi Desert.\nMajor logistical difficulties limited the duration and long-term continuation of these campaigns. According to the analysis of Yan You (\u56b4\u5c24), the difficulties were twofold. Firstly there was the problem of supplying food across long distances. Secondly, the weather in the northern Xiongnu lands was difficult for Han soldiers, who could never carry enough fuel. According to official reports, the Xiongnu lost 80,000 to 90,000 men, and out of the 140,000 horses the Han forces had brought into the desert, fewer than 30,000 returned to the Han Empire.\nIn 104 and 102 BC, the Han fought and won the War of the Heavenly Horses against the Kingdom of Dayuan. As a result, the Han gained many Ferghana horses which further aided them in their battle against the Xiongnu. As a result of these battles, the Han Empire controlled the strategic region from the Ordos and Gansu corridor to Lop Nor. They succeeded in separating the Xiongnu from the Qiang peoples to the south, and also gained direct access to the Western Regions. Because of strong Han control over the Xiongnu, the Xiongnu became unstable and were no longer a threat to the Han Empire.\nXiongnu Civil War (60\u201353 BC).\nWhen a chanyu died, power could pass to his younger brother if his son was not of age. This system normally kept an adult male on the throne, but could cause trouble in later generations when there were several lineages that might claim the throne. When Xul\u00fcquanqu Chanyu died in 60 BC, power was taken by Woyanqudi, a grandson of Xul\u00fcquanqu's cousin. Being something of a usurper, he tried to put his own men in power, which only increased his number of his enemies. Xul\u00fcquanqu's son fled east and, in 58 BC, revolted. Few would support Woyanqudi and he was driven to suicide, leaving the rebel son, Huhanye, as the chanyu. The Woyanqudi faction then set up his brother, Tuqi, as chanyu in 58 BC. In 57 BC three more men declared themselves \"chanyu\". Two dropped their claims in favor of the third who was defeated by Tuqi in that year and surrendered to Huhanye the following year. In 56 BC Tuqi was defeated by Huhanye and committed suicide, but two more claimants appeared: Runzhen and Huhanye's elder brother Zhizhi Chanyu. Runzhen was killed by Zhizhi in 54 BC, leaving only Zhizhi and Huhanye. Zhizhi grew in power, and, in 53 BC, Huhanye moved south and submitted to the Chinese. Huhanye used Chinese support to weaken Zhizhi, who gradually moved west. In 49 BC, a brother to Tuqi set himself up as \"chanyu\" and was killed by Zhizhi. In 36 BC, Zhizhi was killed by a Chinese army while trying to establish a new kingdom in the far west near Lake Balkhash.\nTributary relations with the Han.\nIn 53 BC Huhanye decided to enter into tributary relations with Han China. The original terms insisted on by the Han court were that, first, the \"Chanyu\" or his representatives should come to the capital to pay homage; secondly, the \"Chanyu\" should send a hostage prince; and thirdly, the \"Chanyu\" should present tribute to the Han emperor. The political status of the Xiongnu in the Chinese world order was reduced from that of a \"brotherly state\" to that of an \"outer vassal\" (\u5916\u81e3).\nHuhanye sent his son, the \"wise king of the right\" Shuloujutang, to the Han court as hostage. In 51 BC he personally visited Chang'an to pay homage to the emperor on the Lunar New Year. In the same year, another envoy Qijushan was received at the Ganquan Palace in the north-west of modern Shanxi. On the financial side, Huhanye was amply rewarded in large quantities of gold, cash, clothes, silk, horses and grain for his participation. Huhanye made two further homage trips, in 49 BC and 33 BC; with each one the imperial gifts were increased. On the last trip, Huhanye took the opportunity to ask to be allowed to become an imperial son-in-law. As a sign of the decline in the political status of the Xiongnu, Emperor Yuan refused, giving him instead five ladies-in-waiting. One of them was Wang Zhaojun, famed in Chinese folklore as one of the Four Beauties.\nWhen Zhizhi learned of his brother's submission, he also sent a son to the Han court as hostage in 53\u00a0BC. Then twice \u2013in 51 BC and 50 BC\u2013 he sent envoys to the Han court with tribute. But having failed to pay homage personally, he was never admitted to the tributary system. In 36 BC, a junior officer named Chen Tang, with the help of Gan Yanshou, protector-general of the Western Regions, assembled an expeditionary force that defeated him at the Battle of Zhizhi and sent his head as a trophy to Chang'an.\nTributary relations were discontinued during the reign of Huduershi (18\u201348 AD), corresponding to the political upheavals of the Xin dynasty. The Xiongnu took the opportunity to regain control of the western regions, as well as neighboring peoples such as the Wuhuan. In 24 AD, Hudershi even talked about reversing the tributary system.\nSouthern Xiongnu and Northern Xiongnu.\nThe Xiongnu's new power was met with a policy of appeasement by Emperor Guangwu. At the height of his power, Huduershi even compared himself to his illustrious ancestor, Modu. Due to growing regionalism among the Xiongnu, however, Huduershi was never able to establish unquestioned authority. In contravention of a principle of fraternal succession established by Huhanye, Huduershi designated his son Punu as heir-apparent. However, as the eldest son of the preceding chanyu, Bi (Pi)\u2014the Rizhu King of the Right\u2014had a more legitimate claim. Consequently, Bi refused to attend the annual meeting at the chanyu's court. Nevertheless, in 46 AD, Punu ascended the throne.\nIn 48 AD, a confederation of eight Xiongnu tribes in Bi's power base in the south, with a military force totalling 40,000 to 50,000 men, seceded from Punu's kingdom and acclaimed Bi as chanyu. This kingdom became known as the Southern Xiongnu.\nNorthern Xiongnu.\nThe rump kingdom under Punu, around the Orkhon (modern north central Mongolia) became known as the Northern Xiongnu, with Punu, becoming known as the Northern Chanyu. In 49 AD, the Northern Xiongnu was dealt a heavy defeat to the Southern Xiongnu. That same year, Zhai Tong, a Han governor of Liaodong also enticed the Wuhuan and Xianbei into attacking the Northern Xiongnu. Soon, Punu began sending envoys on several separate occasions to negotiate peace with the Han dynasty, but made little to no progress.\nIn the 60s, the Northern Xiongnu resumed hostilities as they attempted to expand their influence into the Western Regions and launched raids on the Han borders. In 73, the Han responded by sending Dou Gu and Geng Chong to lead a great expedition against the Northern Xiongnu in the Tarim Basin. The expedition, which saw the exploits of the famed general, Ban Chao, was initially successful, but the Han had to temporarily withdraw in 75 due to matters back home. Ban Chao remained behind and maintained Chinese influence over the Western Regions before his death in 102.\"\"\nFor the next decade, the Northern Xiongnu had to endure famines largely due to locust plagues. In 87, they suffered a major defeat to the Xianbei, who killed their chanyu Youliu and took his skin as a trophy. With the Northern Xiongnu in disarray, the Han general, Dou Xian launched an expedition and crushed them at the Battle of the Altai Mountains in 89. After another Han attack in 91, the Northern \"Chanyu\" fled with his followers to the northwest, and was not seen again, while those that remained behind surrendered to the Han.\"\"\nIn 94, dissatisfied with the newly appointed \"chanyu\", the surrendered Northern Xiongnu rebelled and acclaimed Fenghou as their chanyu, who led them to flee outside the border. However, the separatist regime continued to face famines and the growing threat of the Xianbei, prompting 10,000 of them to return to Han in 96. Fenghou later sent envoys to Han intending to submit as a vassal but was rejected. The Northern Xiongnu were scattered, with most of them being absorbed by the Xianbei. In 118, a defeated Fenghou brought around 100 followers to surrender to Han.\"\"\nRemnants of the Northern Xiongnu held out in the Tarim Basin as they allied themselves with the Nearer Jushi Kingdom and captured Yiwu in 119. By 126, they were subjugated by the Han general, Ban Yong, while a branch led by a \"Huyan King\" continued to resist. The Huyan King was last mentioned in 151 when he launched an attack on Yiwu but was driven away by Han forces. According to the fifth-century \"Book of Wei\", the remnants of Northern \"Chanyu\"'s tribe settled as Yueban, near Kucha and subjugated the Wusun; while the rest fled across the Altai Mountains towards Kangju in Transoxania. It states that this group later became the Hephthalites.\nSouthern Xiongnu.\nCoincidentally, the Southern Xiongnu were plagued by natural disasters and misfortunes\u2014in addition to the threat posed by Punu. Consequently, in 50 AD, the Southern Xiongnu submitted to tributary relations with Han China. The system of tribute was considerably tightened by the Han, to keep the Southern Xiongnu under control. The \"Chanyu\" was ordered to establish his court in the Meiji district of Xihe Commandery and the Southern Xiongnu were resettled in eight frontier commanderies. At the same time, large numbers of Chinese were also resettled in these commanderies, in mixed Han-Xiongnu settlements. Economically, the Southern Xiongnu became reliant on trade with the Han and annual subsidies from the Chinese court.\nThe Southern Xiongnu served as Han auxiliaries to defend the northern borders from nomadic forces and even played a role in defeating the Northern Xiongnu. However, with the fall of their northern counterpart, the Southern Xiongnu continued to suffer the brunt of raids, this time by the Xianbei people of the steppe. In addition to the poor climate and living conditions of the frontiers, the Chinese court would also interfere in the Southern Xiongnu's politics and install \"chanyus\" loyal to the Han. As a result, the Southern Xiongnu often rebelled, at times joining forces with the Wuhuan and receiving support from the Xianbei.\nDuring the late 2nd century AD, the \"Chanyu\" began sending his people to deal with the Han's internal matters; first against the Yellow Turban Rebellion and then another rebellion in Hebei in 188. Many of the Xiongnu feared that it would set a precedent for unending military service to the Han court. At the time, another Han vassal, the Xiuchuge people had revolted in Bingzhou and killed the provincial inspector. Subsequently, a rebellious faction among the Southern Xiongnu allied with the Xiuchuge and killed the \"Chanyu\" as well. The Han court appointed his son, Yufuluo, entitled Chizhi Shizhu (), to succeed him, but he was expelled from his territory by the rebels.\nYufuluo travelled to Luoyang to seek aid from the Han court, but the court was in disorder from the clash between Grand General He Jin and the eunuchs, and the intervention of the warlord Dong Zhuo. The \"Chanyu\" subsequently settled down with his followers around Pingyang, east of the Fen River in Shanxi. In 195, he died and was succeeded as \"chanyu\" by his brother Huchuquan. Meanwhile, the rebels initially elected their own \"chanyu\", but after he died just a year into his reign, they left the position vacant and had an elderly nominal king put in his place. With the Southern Xiongnu in disarray, many of the tribes opted to distance themselves from the ongoing Han civil war. Yufuluo's group and the Xiuchuge were drawn into the conflict from time to time before they were all subdued by the warlord Cao Cao.\"\"\nThe Southern Xiongnu upheaval caused several frontier commanderies such as Shuofang and Yunzhong to be lost to hostile tribes, prompting Cao Cao to abolish and abandon them. In 216, he detained Huchuquan in the city of Ye and reorganized the last vestiges of the Southern Xiongnu into the Five Divisions (Left, Right, South, North and Centre) around Taiyuan Commandery in modern-day Shanxi, bringing them closer to the Chinese court's influence. The office of \"chanyu\" remained with Huchuquan at Ye until his death, after which it became vacant, while the Five Divisions were placed under the supervision of his uncle, Qubei. Each division was led by a local chief, who in turn was under the surveillance of a Chinese resident. This was aimed at preventing the tribes in Shanxi from engaging in rebellion, and also allowed Cao Cao to use them as auxiliaries in his cavalry.\nDescendants and later states in northern China.\nFang Xuanling's \"Book of Jin\" lists nineteen Xiongnu tribes that resettled within the Great Wall: Chuge (\u5c60\u5404), Xianzhi (\u9bae\u652f), Koutou (\u5bc7\u982d), Wutan (\u70cf\u8b5a), Chile (\u8d64\u52d2), Hanzhi (\u634d\u86ed), Heilang (\u9ed1\u72fc), Chisha (\u8d64\u6c99), Yugang (\u9b31\u979e), Weisuo (\u840e\u838e), Tutong (\u79bf\u7ae5), Bomie (\u52c3\u8511), Qiangqu (\u7f8c\u6e20), Helai (\u8cc0\u8cf4), Zhongqin (\u9418\u8dc2), Dalou (\u5927\u6a13), Yongqu (\u96cd\u5c48), Zhenshu (\u771f\u6a39) and Lijie (\u529b\u7faf). Among the nineteen tribes, the Chuge, also known as the Xiuchuge, were the most honored and prestigious.\nWith the fall of the Southern Xiongnu state, the Xiongnu name gradually lost its unifying influence among its descendants, only ever invoked for political and symbolic purposes or as a generic label for tribes that did not belong to one of the major ethnic groups at the time. In Bingzhou, the Chuge identity held more weight than that of the Xiongnu among the Five Divisions, while those excluded from the group mingled with tribes from various ethnicities and were referred to as \"hu\" or other vague terms for the non-Chinese. Many of them began adopting Chinese family names such as Liu, which was prevalent among the Five Divisions.\"\"\nNonetheless, the Xiongnu are classified as one of the \"Five Barbarians\" of the Sixteen Kingdoms period. The Han-Zhao and Helian Xia dynasties were both founded by rulers on the basis of their Xiongnu ancestry. The Northern Liang, established by the Lushuihu, is sometimes categorized as a Xiongnu state in recent historiographies. Shi Le, the founder of the Later Zhao dynasty, was a descendant of the Xiongnu Qiangqu tribe, although by his time, he and his people had become a separate ethnic group known as the Jie.\nHan-Zhao dynasty (304\u2013329).\nHan (304\u2013319).\nEventually, the Five Divisions grew weary of subservience and attempted to assert their own power. The Commander of the Left Division, Liu Bao briefly unified them during the mid-3rd century before the Cao Wei and the Western Jin courts intervened and forced them back into five. To further ensure their loyalty, nobles of the Five Divisions had to send their children to the Chinese capital as hostages, where they became accustomed to Chinese Confucian teachings and culture. They were even allowed to hold government offices under the Jin, but their status remained low compared to their Chinese peers. Amidst the War of the Eight Princes in 304, as Jin authority was collapsing in northern China, the Five Divisions took the opportunity to rebel.\nLiu Yuan, the son of Liu Bao and a general serving under one of the Jin princes, was offered by the Five Divisions to lead their rebellion. After deceiving his prince, Liu Yuan returned to Bingzhou and was acclaimed as the Grand \"Chanyu\". Later that year, he declared himself the King of Han. Liu Yuan and his family members were Chuge people, but he also claimed to be a direct descendant of the Southern Xiongnu \"chanyus\" and depicted his state as a continuation of the Han dynasty, citing that his alleged ancestors were married to Han princesses through \"heqin. \"He adopted the Chinese ruling system and allowed the Han Chinese and non-Chinese tribes to serve under him. In 308, he elevated his title to Emperor of Han, and in 309, he settled his capital at Pingyang.\nThe Western Jin, devastated by war and natural disasters, was unable to stop the growing threat of the Han. A few months after Liu Cong took the Han throne, the Jin imperial army was annihilated by his forces in 311. Soon, the Han descended upon the Jin capital Luoyang, sacking the city and capturing Emperor Huai of Jin in an event known as the Disaster of Yongjia. In 316, the Jin restoration in Chang'an, headed by Emperor Min, was also crushed by the Han. After the fall of Chang'an, the remnants of the Jin south of the Yangtze river at Jiankang re-established themselves as the Eastern Jin dynasty in 318.\nDespite military success, the Han's imperial authority was limited. They suffered from internal strife under Liu Cong, who was described as a cruel and dissolute ruler. Faced with stern opposition from his own ministers, he greatly empowered his consort kins and eunuchs to counter them, throwing the Han court into a power struggle which ended in a brutal purge. Liu Cong also failed to constrain Shi Le, a general of Jie ethnicity who effectively held the eastern parts of the empire. After Liu Cong's death in 318, the consort kin, Jin Zhun massacred the imperial family in Pingyang before he was defeated by a combined force led by Liu Cong's cousin, Liu Yao, and Shi Le.\nFormer Zhao (319\u2013329).\nDuring Jin Zhun's rebellion, the Han loyalists that escaped the massacre acclaimed Liu Yao as the new emperor. In 319, he moved the capital from Pingyang to his base in Chang'an and renamed the dynasty as Zhao. Unlike his predecessors, Liu Yao appealed more to his Xiongnu ancestry by honouring Modu Chanyu and distancing himself from the state's initial positioning of Han restoration. However, this was not a break from Liu Yuan, as he continued to honor Liu Yuan and Liu Cong posthumously; it is hence known to historians collectively as Han-Zhao. That same year, Shi Le proclaimed independence and formed his own state of Zhao, challenging Liu Yao for hegemony over northern China. For this reason, Han-Zhao is also known to historians as the Former Zhao to distinguish it from Shi Le's Later Zhao.\nLiu Yao retained control over the Guanzhong region and expanded his domain westward by campaigning against remnants of the Jin, Former Liang and Chouchi. Eventually, Liu Yao led his army to fight Later Zhao for control over Luoyang but was captured by Shi Le's forces in battle and executed in 329. Chang'an soon fell to Later Zhao and the last of Former Zhao's forces were destroyed. Thus ended the Han-Zhao dynasty; northern China would be dominated by the Later Zhao for the next 20 years. The Chuge people would remain a prominent ethnic group in northern China for the next two centuries.\nTiefu tribe and Helian Xia dynasty (309\u2013431).\nThe chieftains of the Tiefu tribe were descendants of Qubei and were related to another tribe, the Dugu. Based on their name, which meant a person whose father was a Xiongnu and mother was a Xianbei, the Tiefu had mingled with the Xianbei, and records refer to them as \"Wuhuan\", which by the 4th-century had become a generic term for miscellaneous \"hu\" tribes with Donghu elements. In 309, their chieftain, Liu Hu rebelled against the Western Jin in Shanxi but was driven out to Shuofang Commandery in the Ordos Loop. The Tiefu resided there for most of their existence, often as a vassal to their stronger neighbours before their power was destroyed by the Northern Wei dynasty in 392.\nLiu Bobo, a surviving member of the Tiefu, went into exile and eventually offered his services to the Qiang-led Later Qin. He was assigned to guard Shuofang, but in 407, angered by Qin holding peace talks with the Northern Wei, he rebelled and founded a state known as the Helian Xia dynasty. Bobo strongly affirmed his Xiongnu lineage; his state name of \"Xia\" was based on the claim that the Xiongnu were descendants of the Xia dynasty, and he later changed his family name from \"Liu\" (\u5289) to the more Xiongnu-like \"Helian\" (\u8d6b\u9023), believing it inappropriate to follow his matrilineal line from the Han. Helian Bobo placed the Later Qin in a perpetual state of warfare and greatly contributed to its decline. In 418, he conquered the Guanzhong region from the Eastern Jin dynasty after the Jin destroyed Qin the previous year.\nAfter Helian Bobo's death in 425, the Xia quickly declined due to pressure from the Northern Wei. In 428, the emperor, Helian Chang and capital were both captured by Wei forces. His brother, Helian Ding succeeded him and conquered the Western Qin in 431, but that same year, he was ambushed and imprisoned by the Tuyuhun while attempting a campaign against Northern Liang. The Xia was at its end, and the following year, Helian Ding was sent to Wei where he was executed.\nTongwancheng (meaning \"Unite All Nations\"), was one of the capitals of the Xia that was built during the reign of Helian Bobo. The ruined city was discovered in 1996 and the State Council designated it as a cultural relic under top state protection. The repair of the Yong'an Platform, where Helian Bobo reviewed parading troops, was completed and restoration on the tall turret follows.\nJuqu clan and Northern Liang dynasty (401\u2013460).\nThe Juqu clan were a Lushuihu family that founded the Northern Liang dynasty in modern-day Gansu in 397. Recent historiographies often classify the Northern Liang as a \"Xiongnu\" state, but there is still ongoing debate on the exact origin of the Lushuihu. A leading theory is that the Lushuihu were descendants of the Lesser Yuezhi that had intermingled with the Qiang people, but based on the fact that the Juqu's ancestors once served the Xiongnu empire, the Lushuihu could still be considered a branch of the Xiongnu. Regardless, contemporaneous records treat the Lushuihu as a distinct ethnic group. The Northern Liang was known for its propagation of Buddhism in Gansu through their construction of Buddhist sites such as the Tiantishan and Mogao caves, and for being the last of the so-called Sixteen Kingdoms after it was conquered by the Northern Wei dynasty in 439. There was also the Northern Liang of Gaochang, which existed between 442 and 460.\nSignificance.\nThe Xiongnu confederation was unusually long-lived for a steppe empire. The purpose of raiding the Central Plain was not simply for goods, but to force the Central Plain polity to pay regular tribute. The power of the Xiongnu ruler was based on his control of Han tribute which he used to reward his supporters. The Han and Xiongnu empires rose at the same time because the Xiongnu state depended on Han tribute. A major Xiongnu weakness was the custom of lateral succession. If a dead ruler's son was not old enough to take command, power passed to the late ruler's brother. This worked in the first generation but could lead to civil war in the second generation. The first time this happened, in 60 BC, the weaker party adopted what Barfield calls the 'inner frontier strategy.' They moved south and submitted to the dominant Central Plain regime and then used the resources obtained from their overlord to defeat the Northern Xiongnu and re-establish the empire. The second time this happened, around 47 AD, the strategy failed. The southern ruler was unable to defeat the northern ruler and the Xiongnu remained divided.\nEthnolinguistic origins.\nHistorians disagree on whether the Xiongnu were of Turkic or Mongolian origin. However, some fragments from Chinese chronicles may indicate that the Xiongnu were of Turkic rather than Mongolian origin. Fragments relating to the Six Kingdoms period state that the Xiongnu spoke a language different from that of the Xianbei, who were of Mongolian or Paramongolian origin. However, the origin of the Xiongnu remains a subject of speculation.\nThe Xiongnu empire is widely thought to have been multiethnic. There are several theories on the ethnolinguistic identity of the Xiongnu, though there is no consensus among scholars as to what language was spoken by the Xiongnu elite.\nProposed link to the Huns.\nThe Xiongnu-Hun hypothesis was originally proposed by the 18th-century French historian Joseph de Guignes, who noticed that ancient Chinese scholars had referred to members of tribes which were associated with the Xiongnu by names which were similar to the name \"Hun\", albeit with varying Chinese characters. \u00c9tienne de la Vaissi\u00e8re has shown that, in the Sogdian script used in the so-called \"Sogdian Ancient Letters\", both the Xiongnu and the Huns were referred to as the \u03b3wn (\"xwn\"), which indicates that the two names were synonymous. Although the theory that the Xiongnu were the precursors of the Huns as they were later known in Europe is now accepted by many scholars, it has yet to become a consensus view. The identification with the Huns may either be incorrect or it may be an oversimplification (as would appear to be the case with a proto-Mongol people, the Rouran, who have sometimes been linked to the Avars of Central Europe).\nIranian theories.\nMost scholars agree that the Xiongnu elite may have been initially of Sogdian origin, while later switching to a Turkic language. Harold Walter Bailey proposed an Iranian origin of the Xiongnu, recognizing all of the earliest Xiongnu names of the 2nd century BC as being of the Iranian type. Central Asian scholar Christopher I. Beckwith notes that the Xiongnu name could be a cognate of Scythian, Saka and Sogdia, corresponding to a name for Eastern Iranian Scythians. According to Beckwith the Xiongnu could have contained a leading Iranian component when they started out, but more likely they had earlier been subjects of an Iranian people and learned the Iranian nomadic model from them.\nIn the 1994 UNESCO-published \"History of Civilizations of Central Asia\", its editor J\u00e1nos Harmatta claims that the royal tribes and kings of the Xiongnu bore Iranian names, that all Xiongnu words noted by the Chinese can be explained from a Scythian language, and that it is therefore clear that the majority of Xiongnu tribes spoke an Eastern Iranian language.\nAccording to a study by Alexander Savelyev and Choongwon Jeong, published in 2020 in the journal Evolutionary Human Sciences, \"The predominant part of the Xiongnu population is likely to have spoken Turkic\". However, important cultural, technological and political elements may have been transmitted by Eastern Iranian-speaking Steppe nomads: \"Arguably, these Iranian-speaking groups were assimilated over time by the predominant Turkic-speaking part of the Xiongnu population\".\nYeniseian theories.\nLajos Ligeti was the first to suggest that the Xiongnu spoke a Yeniseian language. In the early 1960s Edwin Pulleyblank was the first to expand upon this idea with credible evidence. The Yeniseian theory proposes that the Jie, a western Xiongnu people, spoke a Yeniseian language. Hyun Jin Kim notes that the 7th century AD Chinese conpendium, \"Jin Shu\", contains a transliterated song of Jie origin, which appears to be Yeniseian. This song has led researchers Pulleyblank and Vovin to argue for a Yeniseian Jie dominant minority, that ruled over the other Xiongnu ethnicities, such as Iranian and Turkic people. Kim has stated that the dominant Xiongnu language was likely Turkic or Yeniseian, but has cautioned that the Xiongnu were definitely a multi-ethnic society.\nPulleybank and D. N. Keightley asserted that the Xiongnu titles \"were originally Siberian words but were later borrowed by the Turkic and Mongolic peoples\". Titles such as tarqan, tegin and kaghan were also inherited from the Xiongnu language and are possibly of Yeniseian origin. For example, the Xiongnu word for \"heaven\" is theorized to come from Proto-Yeniseian *\"t\u0268\u014bVr\".\nVocabulary from Xiongnu inscriptions sometimes appears to have Yeniseian cognates which were used by Vovin to support his theory that the Xiongnu has a large Yeniseian component, examples of proposed cognates include words such as Xiongnu k\u02b7ala 'son' and Ket qalek 'younger son', Xiongnu sakdak 'boot' and Ket sagdi 'boot', Xiongnu g\u02b7awa \"prince\" and Ket gij \"prince\", Xiongnu \"attij\" 'wife' and proto-Yeniseian \"alrit\", Ket \"alit\" and Xiongnu dar \"north\" compared to Yugh t\u0268r \"north\". Pulleyblank also argued that because Xiongnu words appear to have clusters with r and l, in the beginning of the word it is unlikely to be of Turkic origin, and instead believed that most vocabulary we have mostly resemble Yeniseian languages.\nAlexander Vovin also wrote, that some names of horses in the Xiongnu language appear to be Turkic words with Yeniseian prefixes.\nAn analysis by Savelyev and Jeong (2020) has cast doubt on the Yeniseian theory. If assuming that the ancient Yeniseians were represented by modern Ket people, who are more genetically similar to Samoyedic speakers, the Xiongnu do not display a genetic affinity for Yeniseian peoples. A review by Wilson (2023) argues that the presence of Yeniseian-speakers among the multi-ethnic Xiongnu should not be rejected, and that \"Yeniseian-speaking peoples must have played a more prominent (than heretofore recognized) role in the history of Eurasia during the first millennium of the Common Era\".\nBonmann and Fries (2025) argued that the Xiongnu and succeeding Huns were of multi-ethnic origin, but had, at least a partial, Paleo-Siberian, specifically Yeniseian ethnic core, corresponding to the early Arin language.\nTurkic theories.\nAccording to a study by Alexander Savelyev and Choongwon Jeong, published in 2020 in the journal Evolutionary Human Sciences, \"The predominant part of the Xiongnu population is likely to have spoken Turkic\". However, genetic studies found a mixture of haplogroups from western and eastern Eurasian origins that suggested large genetic diversity, and possibly multiple origins of Xiongnu elites. The Turkic-related component may be brought by eastern Eurasian genetic substratum.\nOther proponents of a Turkic language theory include E.H. Parker, Jean-Pierre Abel-R\u00e9musat, Julius Klaproth, Gustaf John Ramstedt, Annemarie von Gabain, and Charles Hucker. Andr\u00e9 Wink states that the Xiongnu probably spoke an early form of Turkic; even if Xiongnu were not \"Turks\" nor Turkic-speaking, they were in close contact with Turkic-speakers very early on. Craig Benjamin sees the Xiongnu as either proto-Turks or proto-Mongols who possibly spoke a language related to the Dingling.\nChinese sources link several Turkic peoples to the Xiongnu: \nHowever, Chinese sources also ascribe Xiongnu origins to the Para-Mongolic-speaking Kumo Xi and Khitans.\nMongolic theories.\nMongolian and other scholars have suggested that the Xiongnu spoke a language related to the Mongolic languages. Mongolian archaeologists proposed that the Slab Grave Culture people were the ancestors of the Xiongnu, and some scholars have suggested that the Xiongnu may have been the ancestors of the Mongols. Nikita Bichurin considered Xiongnu and Xianbei to be two subgroups (or dynasties) of but one same ethnicity.\nAccording to the \"Book of Song\", the Rourans, which the \"Book of Wei\" identified as offspring of Proto-Mongolic Donghu people, possessed the alternative name(s) \u5927\u6a80 \"D\u00e0t\u00e1n\" \"Tatar\" and/or \u6a80\u6a80 \"T\u00e1nt\u00e1n\" \"Tartar\" and according to the \"Book of Liang\", \"they also constituted a separate branch of the Xiongnu\". The \"Old Book of Tang\" mentioned twenty Shiwei tribes, which other Chinese sources (the \"Book of Sui\" and the \"New Book of Tang\") associated with the Khitans, another people who in turn descended from the Xianbei and were also associated with the Xiongnu. While the Xianbei, Khitans, and Shiwei are generally believed to be predominantly Mongolic- and Para-Mongolic-speaking, yet Xianbei were stated to descend from the Donghu, whom Sima Qian distinguished from the Xiongnu (notwithstanding Sima Qian's inconsistency). Additionally, Chinese chroniclers routinely ascribed Xiongnu origins to various nomadic groups: for examples, Xiongnu ancestry was ascribed to Para-Mongolic-speaking Kumo Xi, as well as the Turkic-speaking G\u00f6kt\u00fcrks and Tiele;\nGenghis Khan refers to the time of Modu Chanyu as \"the remote times of our \"chanyu\"\" in his letter to Daoist Qiu Chuji. Moreover, the sun and moon symbol of Xiongnu discovered by archaeologists is similar to Mongolian Soyombo symbol.\nMultiple ethnicities.\nSince the early 19th century, a number of Western scholars have proposed a connection between various language families or subfamilies and the language or languages of the Xiongnu. Albert Terrien de Lacouperie considered them to be multi-component groups. Many scholars believe the Xiongnu confederation was a mixture of different ethno-linguistic groups, and that their main language (as represented in the Chinese sources) and its relationships have not yet been satisfactorily determined. Kim rejects \"old racial theories or even ethnic affiliations\" in favour of the \"historical reality of these extensive, multiethnic, polyglot steppe empires\".\nChinese sources link the Tiele people and Ashina to the Xiongnu, not all Turkic peoples. According to the \"Book of Zhou\" and the \"History of the Northern Dynasties\", the Ashina clan was a component of the Xiongnu confederation, but this connection is disputed, and according to the \"Book of Sui\" and the \"Tongdian\", they were \"mixed nomads\" () from Pingliang. The Ashina and Tiele may have been separate ethnic groups who mixed with the Xiongnu. Indeed, Chinese sources link many nomadic peoples (\"hu\"; see \"Wu Hu\") on their northern borders to the Xiongnu, just as Greco-Roman historiographers called Avars and Huns \"Scythians\". The Greek cognate of \"Tourkia\" () was used by the Byzantine emperor and scholar Constantine VII in his book \"De Administrando Imperio\", though in his use, \"Turks\" always referred to Magyars. Such archaizing was a common literary \"topos\", and implied similar geographic origins and nomadic lifestyle but not direct filiation.\nSome Uyghurs claimed descent from the Xiongnu (according to Chinese history Weishu, the founder of the Uyghur Khaganate was descended from a Xiongnu ruler), but many contemporary scholars do not consider the modern Uyghurs to be of direct linear descent from the old Uyghur Khaganate because modern Uyghur language and Old Uyghur languages are different. Rather, they consider them to be descendants of a number of people, one of them the ancient Uyghurs.\nIn various kinds of ancient inscriptions on monuments of Munmu of Silla, it is recorded that King Munmu had Xiongnu ancestry. According to several historians, it is possible that there were tribes of Koreanic origin. There are also some Korean researchers that point out that the grave goods of Silla and of the eastern Xiongnu are alike.\nLanguage isolate theories.\nTurkologist Gerhard Doerfer has denied any possibility of a relationship between the Xiongnu language and any other known language, even any connection with Turkic or Mongolian.\nGeographic origins.\nThe original geographic location of the Xiongnu is disputed among steppe archaeologists. Since the 1960s, the geographic origin of the Xiongnu has attempted to be traced through an analysis of Early Iron Age burial constructions. No region has been proven to have mortuary practices that clearly match those of the Xiongnu.\nArchaeology.\nIn the 1920s, Pyotr Kozlov oversaw the excavation of royal tombs at the Noin-Ula burial site in northern Mongolia, dated to around the first century AD. Other Xiongnu sites have been unearthed in Inner Mongolia, such as the Ordos culture. Sinologist Otto Maenchen-Helfen has said that depictions of the Xiongnu of Transbaikalia and the Ordos commonly show individuals with West Eurasian features. Iaroslav Lebedynsky said that West Eurasian depictions in the Ordos region should be attributed to a \"Scythian affinity\".\nPortraits found in the Noin-Ula excavations demonstrate other cultural evidence and influences, showing that Chinese and Xiongnu art influenced each other mutually. Some of these embroidered portraits in the Noin-Ula kurgans also depict the Xiongnu with long braided hair with wide ribbons, which is seen to be identical with the Ashina clan hair-style. Well-preserved bodies in Xiongnu and pre-Xiongnu tombs in Mongolia and southern Siberia show both East Asian and West Eurasian features.\nAnalysis of cranial remains from some sites attributed to the Xiongnu have revealed that they had dolichocephalic skulls with East Asian craniometrical features, setting them apart from neighboring populations in present-day Mongolia. Russian and Chinese anthropological and craniofacial studies show that the Xiongnu were physically very heterogenous, with six different population clusters showing different degrees of West Eurasian and East Asian physical traits.\nPresently, there exist four fully excavated and well documented cemeteries: Ivolga, Dyrestui, Burkhan Tolgoi, and Daodunzi. Additionally thousands of tombs have been recorded in Transbaikalia and Mongolia.\nThe archaeologists at a Xiongnu cemetery in Arkhangai Province said the following: \"There is no clear indication of the ethnicity of this tomb occupant, but in a similar brick-chambered tomb of the late Eastern Han period at the same cemetery, archaeologists discovered a bronze seal with the official title that the Han government bestowed upon the leader of the Xiongnu. The excavators suggested that these brick chamber tombs all belong to the Xiongnu (Qinghai 1993).\"Classifications of these burial sites make distinction between two prevailing type of burials: \"(1) monumental ramped terrace tombs which are often flanked by smaller \"satellite\" burials and (2) 'circular' or 'ring' burials.\" Some scholars consider this a division between \"elite\" graves and \"commoner\" graves. Other scholars, find this division too simplistic and not evocative of a true distinction because it shows \"ignorance of the nature of the mortuary investments and typically luxuriant burial assemblages [and does not account for] the discovery of other lesser interments that do not qualify as either of these types.\"\nGenetics.\nMaternal lineages.\nA 2003 study found that 89% of Xiongnu maternal lineages are of East Asian origin, while 11% were of West Eurasian origin. However, a 2016 study found that 37.5% of Xiongnu maternal lineages were West Eurasian, in a central Mongolian sample.\nAccording to Rogers &amp; Kaestle (2022), these studies make clear that the Xiongnu population is extremely similar to the preceding Slab Grave population, which had a similar frequency of Eastern and Western maternal haplogroups, supporting a hypothesis of continuity from the Slab Grave period to the Xiongnu. They wrote that the bulk of the genetics research indicates that roughly 27% of Xiongnu maternal haplogroups were of West Eurasian origin, while the rest were East Asian.\nSome examples of maternal haplogroups observed in Xiongnu specimens include D4b2b4, N9a2a, G3a3, D4a6 and D4b2b2b. and U2e1.\nPaternal lineages.\nAccording to Rogers &amp; Kaestle (2022), roughly 47% of Xiongnu period remains belonged to paternal haplogroups associated with modern West Eurasians, while the rest (53%) belonged to East Asian haplogroups. They observed that this contrasts strongly with the preceding Slab Grave period, which was dominated by East Asian patrilineages. They suggest that this may reflect an aggressive expansion of people with West Eurasian paternal haplogroups, or perhaps the practice of marriage alliances or cultural networks favoring people with Western patrilines.\nSome examples of paternal haplogroups in Xiongnu specimens include C2, Q1b, R1, R1b, O3a and O3a3b2, , J2a, J1a and E1b1b1a.\nAccording to Lee &amp; Kuang, the main paternal lineages of Xiongnu Elite remains in the Egiin Gol valley belonged to the paternal haplogroups N1c1, Q-M242, and C-M217. Xiongnu remains from Barkol belonged exclusively to haplogroup Q. They argue that the haplogroups C2, Q and N likely formed the major paternal haplogroups of the Xiongnu tribes, while R1a was the most common paternal haplogroup (44.5%) among neighbouring nomads from the Altai mountain, who were probably incorporated into the Xiongnu confederation and may be associated with the Jie people. Elite Xiongnu samples from Duurlig Nars belonged to R1a1 and to C-M217, while elite Xiongnu remains from Tamir Ulaan Khoshuu beloged to R1a-Z95, R1a-Z2125, Q1a-M120, J1 and N1a1. According to Juhyeon Lee sample DA39, a likely \"chanyu\" of the Xiongnu empire from Gol Mod 2 site in central-north Mongolia was assigned to haplogroup R1 and nobility from Shombuuzyn Belchir, samples SBB009, SBB010 and SBB001 belonged to haplogroup C-F1756. H\u00f6gstr\u00f6m et al. (2024) later reassigned DA39 to haplogroup R-Y56311.\nAutosomal ancestry.\nA study published in the \"American Journal of Physical Anthropology\" in October 2006 detected significant genetic continuity between the examined individuals at Egyin Gol and modern Mongolians.\nA genetic study published in \"Nature\" in May 2018 examined the remains of five Xiongnu. The study concluded that Xiongnu confederation was genetically heterogeneous, and Xiongnu individuals belonging to two distinct groups, one being of primarily East Asian origin (associated with the earlier Slab-grave culture) and the other presenting considerable admixture levels with West Eurasian (possibly from Central Saka) sources. The evidence suggested that the Huns probably emerged through minor male-driven geneflow into the Saka through westward migrations of the Xiongnu.\nA study published in November 2020 examined 60 early and late Xiongnu individuals from across Mongolia. The study found that the Xiongnu resulted from the admixture of three different clusters from the Mongolian region. The two early genetic clusters are \"early Xiongnu_west\" from the Altai Mountains (formed at 92% by the hybrid Eurasian Chandman ancestry, and 8% BMAC ancestry), and \"early Xiongnu_rest\" from the Mongolian Plateau (individuals with primarily Ulaanzuukh-Slab Grave ancestry, or mixed with \"early Xiongnu_west\"). The later third cluster named \"late Xiongnu\" has even higher heterogenity, with the continued combination of Chandman and Ulaanzuukh-Slab Grave ancestry, and additional geneflow from Sarmatian and Han Chinese sources. Their uniparental haplogroup assignments also showed heterogenetic influence on their ethnogenesis as well as their connection with Huns. In contrast, the later Mongols had a much higher eastern Eurasian ancestry as a whole, similar to that of modern-day Mongolic-speaking populations.\nA Xiongnu remain (GD1-4) analysed in a 2024 study was found to be entirely derived from Ancient Northeast Asians without any West Eurasian-associated ancestry. The sample clustered closely with a G\u00f6kt\u00fcrk remain (GD1-1) from the later Turkic period.\nRelationship between ethnicity and status among the Xiongnu.\nAlthough the Xiongnu were ethnically heterogeneous as a whole, it appears that variability was highly related to social status. Genetic heterogeneity was highest among retainers of low status, as identified by their smaller and peripheral tombs. These retainers mainly displayed ancestry related to the Chandman/Uyuk culture (characterized by a hybrid Eurasian gene pool combining the genetic profile of the Sintashta culture and Baikal hunter-gatherers (Baikal EBA)), or various combinations of Chandman/Uyuk and Ancient Northeast Asian Ulaanzuukh/Slab Grave profiles.\nOn the contrary, high status Xiongnu individuals tended to have less genetic diversity, and their ancestry was essentially derived from the Eastern Eurasian Ulaanzuukh/Slab Grave culture, or alternatively from the Xianbei, suggesting multiple sources for their Eastern ancestry. High Eastern ancestry was more common among high status female samples, while low status male samples tended to be more diverse and having higher Western ancestry. DA39, a likely \"chanyu\" identified by his prestigious tomb, was shown to have had similar ancestry as a high status female in the \"western frontiers\", deriving about 39.3% Slab Grave (or Ancient Northeast Asian) genetic ancestry, 51.9% Han (or Yellow River farmers) ancestry, with the rest (8.8%) being Saka (Chandman) ancestry. \nCulture.\nArt.\nWithin the Xiongnu culture more variety is visible from site to site than from \"era\" to \"era,\" in terms of Chinese chronology, yet all form a whole that is distinct from that of the Han and other peoples of the non-Chinese north. In some instances, the iconography cannot be used as the main cultural identifier, because art depicting animal predation is common among the steppe peoples. An example of animal predation associated with Xiongnu culture is that of a tiger carrying dead prey. A similar motif appears in work from Maoqinggou, a site which is presumed to have been under Xiongnu political control but is still clearly non-Xiongnu. In the Maoqinggou example, the prey is replaced with an extension of the tiger's foot. The work also depicts a cruder level of execution; Maoqinggou work was executed in a rounder, less detailed style. In its broadest sense, Xiongnu iconography of animal predation includes examples such as the gold headdress from Aluchaideng and gold earrings with a turquoise and jade inlay discovered in Xigoupan, Inner Mongolia.\nXiongnu art is harder to distinguish from Saka or Scythian art. There is a similarity present in stylistic execution, but Xiongnu art and Saka art often differ in terms of iconography. Saka art does not appear to have included predation scenes, especially with dead prey, or same-animal combat. Additionally, Saka art included elements not common to Xiongnu iconography, such as winged, horned horses. The two cultures also used two different kinds of bird heads. Xiongnu depictions of birds tend to have a medium-sized eye and beak, and they are also depicted with ears, while Saka birds have a pronounced eye and beak, and no ears. Some scholars claim these differences are indicative of cultural differences. Scholar Sophia-Karin Psarras suggests that Xiongnu images of animal predation, specifically tiger-and-prey, are a spiritual representation of death and rebirth, and that same-animal combat is representative of the acquisition or maintenance of power.\nRock art and writing.\nThe rock art of the Yin and Helan Mountains is dated from the 9th millennium BC to the 19th century AD. It consists mainly of engraved signs (petroglyphs) and only minimally of painted images.\nChinese sources indicate that the Xiongnu did not have an ideographic form of writing like Chinese, but in the 2nd century BC, a renegade Chinese dignitary Yue \"taught the Shanyu to write official letters to the Chinese court on a wooden tablet long, and to use a seal and large-sized folder.\" The same sources tell that when the Xiongnu noted down something or transmitted a message, they made cuts on a piece of wood ('ke-mu'), and they also mention a \"Hu script\" (vol. ). At Noin-Ula and other Xiongnu burial sites in Mongolia and the region north of Lake Baikal, among the objects discovered during excavations conducted in 1924 and 1925 were over 20 carved characters. Most of these characters are either identical or very similar to letters of the Old Turkic alphabet of the Early Middle Ages found on the Eurasian steppes. From this, some specialists conclude that the Xiongnu used a script similar to the ancient Eurasian runiform, and that this alphabet was a basis for later Turkic writing.\nReligion and diet.\nAccording to the \"Book of Han\", the Xiongnu called Heaven (\u5929) 'Ch\u0113ngl\u00ed,' (\u6490\u7281) a Chinese transcription of Tengri. The Xiongnu were a nomadic people. From their lifestyle of herding flocks and their horse-trade with China, it can be concluded that their diet consisted mainly of mutton, horse meat and wild geese that were shot down.\nHistorical evidence gives reason to believe that, from the 2nd century BC, proto-Mongol peoples (the Xiongnu, Xianbei, and Khitans) were familiar with Buddhism. Remains of Buddhist prayer beads were found in a Xiongnu grave in Ivolginsky District.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\nPrimary sources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nOther sources consulted.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is north-east of Oundle and around west of Peterborough. It is most noted for being the site of Fotheringhay (or Fotheringay) Castle which was razed in 1627. There is nothing left of the castle to be seen today other than the motte on which it was built that provides excellent views of the River Nene. The Nene Way long distance footpath runs through the village.\nAs the home of the great Yorkist line, the village was, for a considerable part of the 15th and 16th centuries, of national standing. The death of Richard III at Bosworth Field altered its history irrevocably. As the historian John Nicholls stated, \"Fotheringhay has been distinguished beyond any other place in Britain, except the Capital, by the aggravated misfortunes of Royalty.\"\nAt the time of the 2001 census, the parish's population was 123 people, reducing to 119 at the 2011 census.\nHistory.\nThe first written mention of a settlement here was in 1060, and the Domesday Book of 1086 lists the site as 'Fodringeia'. John Leland wrote this as 'Foderingeye' or \"Fodering inclosure\", referring to the section of the forest that is segregated for the purpose of producing hay. During the medieval period the village was variously mentioned as Foderingey, Foderinghay, Forderinghay, and Fotheringhaye.\nAccess to the village was formerly via a ford of the Nene adjacent to the former castle site. The first bridge built was ordered by Elizabeth I in 1573. The present bridge was built by George Portwood of Stamford in 1722 under the orders of the Earl of Nottingham, then proprietor of the estate.\nIn medieval times, it hosted a weekly market, held between at least the start of the fourteenth century and around the mid-fifteenth century, and was also the site of an annual fair beginning on the eve of the feast of St Michael (later moving to the Sunday after Relic Sunday in July and still celebrated in the nineteenth century).\nSixteenth-century Fotheringhay, as observed by Leland, consisted a single street of around 40 houses and a population of around 300. In the 17th century the population dropped sharply when the castle was destroyed. By 1811 it had risen to a peak of around 310 but has fallen steadily since. The present population is 125 (2006 est.).\nThe village was formerly home to a renowned grammar school, believed to have been formed as the continuation of the collegiate church and probably founded by Edward VI.\nNotable former residents include Walter de Foderingey, the first principal of Balliol College, Oxford in 1282.\nThe lordship of the town and the castle passed through many hands through the years. From the Earl of Newport, the lordship passed to George Savile, 1st Marquess of Halifax, and thence to his son, William Savile, the second Marquis, who died without issue. The manor and castle were then sold by his father-in-law, Daniel Finch, 2nd Earl of Nottingham, to Hewer Edgeley Hewer (heir to William Hewer, Samuel Pepys' onetime servant and later prot\u00e9g\u00e9 in the Admiralty). Hewer himself died without issue on 6 November 1728, when it passed to Hewer's heirs, the Blackborne family. In 1797 Samuel Pepys's great-great-nephew Samuel Pepys Cockerell sold the estate of Rev. Abraham Blackborne in Fotheringhay.\nEventually the lordship of the manor and castle came to the Belsey family.\nFotheringhay Castle.\nAfter the manor came into the possession of Edward III he passed it to his son Edmund of Langley, 1st Duke of York, founder of the Yorkist line. The castle then became the home of the Dukes of York. Richard III was born there in 1452, and his father, Richard Plantagenet, 3rd Duke of York was re-buried at the nearby church in 1476. Duke Richard's wife, Cecily Neville, Duchess of York, was later interred in the same tomb. The tomb opposite contains the body of Edward, the 2nd Duke of York, who was killed at the Battle of Agincourt.\nFotheringhay is also where Mary, Queen of Scots, was tried and beheaded in 1587, and her body lay there for some months before its burial at Peterborough Cathedral and then its final burial in Westminster Abbey. Although it is often said that James I destroyed the castle because his mother was killed there, the facts are rather more prosaic; it fell into such disrepair that it had to be pulled down, and the stones were all taken to be used in other buildings. Local legend has it that the staircase from the castle is now in the Talbot Hotel in Oundle.\nChurch of St Mary and All Saints.\nThe work on the present church was begun by Edward III who also built a college as a cloister on the church's southern side. After completion in around 1430, a parish church of similar style was added to the western end of the collegiate church with work beginning in 1434. It is the parish church which still remains.\nThe large present church is named in honour of St Mary and All Saints, and has a distinctive tall tower dominating the local skyline. The church is Perpendicular in style and although only the nave, aisles and octagonal tower remain of the original building it is still in the best style of its period.\nThe church contains a notable 15th-century painted pulpit donated by Edward IV.\nEdward of Norwich, 2nd Duke of York, who was killed at the Battle of Agincourt in 1415, Richard Plantagenet, 3rd Duke of York, and his wife, Cecily Neville as well as his son Edmund, Earl of Rutland, who with Richard himself, fell at the Battle of Wakefield in 1460, are buried in the church. After the choir of the church was destroyed in the 16th century, Elizabeth I ordered the removal of the smashed York tombs and created the present monuments to the third Duke and his wife around the altar.\nThe birthday of Richard III is commemorated annually by the Richard III Society by the placing of white roses in the church.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "74323", "revid": "50059249", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=74323", "title": "Adjective phrase", "text": "Type of phrase\nAn adjective phrase (or adjectival phrase) is a phrase whose head is an adjective. Almost any grammar or syntax textbook or dictionary of linguistics terminology defines the adjective phrase in a similar way, e.g. Kesner Bland (1996:499), Crystal (1996:9), Greenbaum (1996:288ff.), Haegeman and Gu\u00e9ron (1999:70f.), Brinton (2000:172f.), Jurafsky and Martin (2000:362). The adjective can initiate the phrase (e.g. \"fond of steak\"), conclude the phrase (e.g. \"very happy\"), or appear in a medial position (e.g. \"quite upset about it\"). The dependents of the head adjective\u2014i.e. the other words and phrases inside the adjective phrase\u2014are typically adverb or prepositional phrases, but they can also be clauses (e.g. \"louder than you are\"). Adjectives and adjective phrases function in two basic ways, attributively or predicatively. An attributive adjective (phrase) precedes the noun of a noun phrase (e.g. \"a very happy\" man). A predicative adjective (phrase) follows a linking verb and serves to describe the preceding subject, e.g. \"The man is very happy\".\nAttributive vs. predicative.\nThe adjective phrases are underlined in the following example sentences. The head adjective in each of these phrases is in bold, and how the adjective phrase is functioning\u2014attributively or predicatively\u2014is stated to the right of each example:\nThe distinguishing characteristic of an attributive adjective phrase is that it appears inside the noun phrase that it modifies. An interesting trait of these phrases in English is that an attributive adjective alone generally precedes the noun, e.g. \"a proud man\", whereas a head-initial or head-medial adjective phrase follows its noun, e.g. \"a man proud of his children\". A predicative adjective (phrase), in contrast, appears outside of the noun phrase that it describes, usually after a linking verb, e.g. \"The man is proud of his children\".\nAdjective vs. adjectival.\nThere is a tendency to call a phrase an \"adjectival phrase\" when that phrase is functioning like an adjective phrase, but is not actually headed by an adjective. For example, in \"Mr Clinton is a man of wealth\", the prepositional phrase \"of wealth\" modifies \"a man\" in a manner similar to how an adjective phrase would, and it can be reworded with an adjective, e.g. \"Mr Clinton is a wealthy man\". A more accurate term for such cases is \"phrasal attributive\" or \"attributive phrase\".\nConstituency tests.\nConstituency tests can also be used to identify adjectives and adjective phrases. Here are the three constituency tests, according to X-bar theory, that prove the adjective phrase is both a constituent, and an AP.\nIn the following tests, consider the sentence: Sam ordered a very spicy pizza.\nSemantic ambiguity.\nAlthough constituency tests can prove the existence of an AP in a sentence, the meanings of these AP may be ambiguous. This ambiguity must be considered when considering the semantic versus pragmatic meaning. The following examples prove two things: \n\"Note: This section can be added into the adjectives page, but ambiguity can also apply to adjective phrases. Additionally, comma placements and intonations may have a role in figuring out ambiguity, but English has a written form of communication that is more ambiguous than spoken communication.\"\nThe following examples show the different interpretive properties of pre- and post-nominal adjectives which are inside adjective phrases.\nIntersective versus non-intersective interpretation of AP.\nThis example showed then entire adjective phrase moving, creating the same ambiguity as example 1. Therefore, the placement of the adjective relative to the subject is important for creating unambiguous statements.\nRestrictive versus non-restrictive interpretation of AP.\nThe adjective blessed is ambiguous in pre-nominal position because it creates a restrictive and a nonrestrictive interpretation (a), while in post-nominal position it only displays a restrictive interpretation (b). Plus, when the main adjective of the adjective phrase is moved to post-nominal position, only one interpretation is possible.\nThere is cross-linguistic validity, according to the multiple articles referenced in Cinque's article, which studied this adjective placement in Italian as well. Cinque discovered that exactly the same pattern was seen in Italian, because ambiguous interpretations only appeared when the adjective phrase was placed in pre-nominal position. Next, other research articles also confirm that this word order phenomenon exists in Mandarin Chinese, creating ambiguous interpretations. For example, an adjective phrase with the head adjective \"private\" in pre-object position, creates two interpretations. On the other hand, an adjective phrase with the head adjective \"private\" placed in post-object position only creates one interpretation.\nTree diagram representations.\nThe structure of adjective phrases (and of all other phrase types) can be represented using tree structures. There are two modern conventions for doing this, constituency-based trees of phrase structure grammars and dependency-based trees of dependency grammars. Both types of trees are produced here. The important aspect of these tree structures\u2014regardless of whether one uses constituency or dependency to show the structure of phrases\u2014is that they are identified as adjective phrases by the label on the top node of each tree.\nHead-final adjective phrases.\nThe following trees illustrate head-final adjective phrases, i.e. adjective phrases that have their head adjective on the right side of the phrase:\nThe labels on the nodes in the trees are acronyms: A = adjective, Adv = adverb, AP = adjective phrase, N = noun/pronoun, P = preposition, PP = prepositional phrase. The constituency trees identify these phrases as adjective phrases by labeling the top node with AP, and the dependency trees accomplish the same thing by positioning the A node at the top of the tree.\nHead-initial adjective phrases.\nThe following trees illustrate the structure of head-initial adjective phrases, i.e. adjective phrases that have their head on the left side of the phrase:\nHead-medial adjective phrases.\nThe following trees illustrate the structure of head-medial adjective phrases:\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;"}
{"id": "74325", "revid": "50735918", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=74325", "title": "The Magic Roundabout", "text": "English television series, 1965\u20131977\nThe Magic Roundabout is an English-language children's programme that ran on BBC Television from 1965 to 1977.\nIt used the footage of the French stop motion animation show \"Le Man\u00e8ge enchant\u00e9\" but with completely different scripts and characters. The French series, created by Serge Danot with the help of Ivor Wood and Wood's French wife, Josiane, was broadcast from 1964 to 1974 on ORTF (Office de Radiodiffusion T\u00e9l\u00e9vision Fran\u00e7aise). The scripts are simple fantasy stories aimed at pre-school children, with no relation to the real world. The BBC originally rejected translating the series because it was \"charming... but difficult to dub into English\", but later produced a version of the series using the French footage with new English-language scripts unrelated to the original storylines. This version, written and told by Eric Thompson, was broadcast in 441 five-minute episodes between 18 October 1965 and 25 January 1977. It proved a great success and attained cult status, and when in October 1966 it was moved from the slot just before the evening news to an earlier children's viewing time, adult viewers complained to the BBC.\nCharacters.\nAlthough the characters are common to the French and English versions, they were given different names and personalities in each language.\nThe main character is Dougal (also known as Doogal; Pollux in the original French-language version), who was a drop-eared variety of the Skye Terrier.\nOther characters include Zebedee (Z\u00e9bulon), a talking jack-in-the-box with magical powers; Brian (Ambroise), a snail; Ermintrude (Azal\u00e9e), a cow; and Dylan (named after Bob Dylan) (Flappy), a hippy rabbit. There are two notable human characters: Florence (Margote), a young girl; and Mr Rusty (le P\u00e8re Pivoine), the elderly moustached operator of the roundabout.\nOther characters included Mr McHenry (Bonhomme Jouvence), the elderly gardener who rode a tricycle, and a talking locomotive with a 4-2-2 wheel arrangement and a two-wheel tender. Three other children, Paul, Basil and Rosalie, appeared in the original black-and-white serial and in the credit sequence of the colour episodes, but very rarely in subsequent episodes. The characters all reside in a place called The Magic Garden (Beautywood in the US version). \nThe show has a distinctive visual style. The set is a brightly coloured and stylised park containing the eponymous roundabout (a fairground carousel). The programmes were created using stop-motion animation, which meant that Dougal was made without legs to make him easier to animate. Zebedee was created from a giant pea which was available in the animation studio and was re-painted. The look of these characters was the responsibility of British animator Ivor Wood, who was working at Danot's studio at the time (and who subsequently animated \"The Herbs\", \"Paddington Bear\", \"Postman Pat\", \"Gran\" and \"Bertha\").\nEnglish-language version.\nNarration in the British BBC version was entirely new and bears very little to no resemblance to the French version. It was created by Eric Thompson from just the visuals, without any translation of the French scripts by Serge Danot. Thompson provided all the voices, whereas in the French version each character was voiced by a different actor.\nThe first British broadcasts were shown every weekday on BBC1 at 17:50, just before the early-evening news at 17:55. Although the exact time of the early evening news varied over the years, \"The Magic Roundabout\" kept its slot before the bulletins for the duration of its original broadcasting, except for 16:55 time slots during October to November 1966, and earlier times during parts of 1972 and 1973. This was the first time an entertainment programme had been transmitted in this way in the UK. The original series, which was a serial, was made in black-and-white. From the second series onwards it was made in colour, but the series was still broadcast in black-and-white by the BBC; the first colour episode of the show (\"Chocolate Soldiers\") was transmitted on 5 October 1970.\n(At the time of broadcast, the main BBC1 channel was still broadcast on the VHF band which was limited to 405 lines and did not support colour, while the newer BBC2 channel was in colour in the higher UHF band using PAL transmission for 625 lines.) \n52 additional episodes, claimed to have been not previously broadcast, were shown in the United Kingdom from January to March 1992 on Channel 4's \"The Channel Four Daily\". Thompson had died by this time, and the job of narrating them in a pastiche of Thompson's style went to actor Nigel Planer. These episodes actually had been previously narrated by Thompson (particularly from the 1970\u20131971 series), being redubbed editions of the original French colour episodes by AB Productions (with different music) broadcast in 1990. An additional 43 episodes were narrated by Planer from April to September 1993, this time, with most of the episodes coming from a batch of new French episodes broadcast during that same year up until 1995.\nThe English version of Dougal was generally disparaging and had similarities with the television character of Tony Hancock, an actor and comedian. Ermintrude was rather matronly and fond of singing. Dylan was a hippy-like, guitar-playing rabbit, and rather dopey. Florence was portrayed as courteous and level-headed. Brian was unsophisticated but well-meaning.\nPart of the show's attraction was that it appealed to adults, who enjoyed the world-weary Hancock-style comments made by Dougal, as well as to children. The audience measured eight million at its peak. There are speculations about possible interpretations of the show. One is that the characters represented French politicians of the time, and that Dougal represented Charles de Gaulle. In fact, when Serge Danot was interviewed by Joan Bakewell on \"Late Night Line-Up\" in 1968, his associate (perhaps Jean Biard) said that in France it was thought at first that the UK version of Pollux had been renamed \"De Gaulle\", mishearing the name Dougal (as seen in the Channel 4 documentary \"The Return of the Magic Roundabout\" (broadcast 08:50 on 25 December 1991 and 18:00 on 5 January 1992), and in the 2003 BBC4 documentary \"The Magic Roundabout Story\").\nSometimes, the series broke the fourth wall. At the end of one episode, \"A Peaceful Day\", when Zebedee called his catchphrase of \"Time for bed\", Florence asked \"Already?\", and Zebedee replied that \"It's nearly time for the news, and you've had enough magic for one day\". The news was broadcast just after \"The Magic Roundabout\". This story was later republished in print from Bloomsbury's 1998 book \"The Adventures of Brian\".\nIn 1971 Brockhampton Press, under their paperback imprint Knight Books, published two books written by Eric Thompson, \"The Adventures of Dougal\" and \"Dougal's Scottish Holiday\". These were original stories written by Thompson using the characters, and not versions of scripts from the series.\nIn 1998, Thompson's stories were published by Bloomsbury Publishing Plc as a series of four paperbacks, \"The Adventures of Dougal\", \"The Adventures of Brian\", \"The Adventures of Dylan\" and \"The Adventures of Ermintrude\" with forewords by his daughter Emma Thompson. While \"The Adventures of Dougal\" featured republications of three exclusive book stories, the latter three featured scripts from the TV series. She explains that her father had felt that he was most like Brian of all the characters and that Ermintrude was in some respects based upon his wife, Phyllida Law.\nFor years, the series had reruns on Cartoon Network and was later moved to its sister channel, Boomerang. These airings mainly used episodes from the 1974 series, which have been renarrated by Jimmy Hibbert (who unlike the previous British dubs, actually translated the French scripts, though not entirely verbatim), though some episodes from the Nigel Planer dub aired as well.\nA new version is being made by the French studio Method Animation, initially targeted for 2024, that will try to \"find a balance between the French and English contexts\".\nTheme tunes.\nThe show's theme by Alain Legrand, was a cheerful organ tune. In the early black-and-white episodes, it was played more slowly with a degree of sadness. There were also two different additional theme songs for reruns of the original French version; the first, \"C'est moi, Pollux\" (1983), was a moderately popular single in France, while the theme from 1990 was an upbeat Hammond organ pop tune with children's vocals.\nFilm versions.\nUnlike the series, both films featured a villain in the Magic Roundabout canon.\n\"Dougal and the Blue Cat\".\nDanot made a longer film, \"Pollux et le chat bleu\", in 1970 which was also adapted by Thompson and shown in Britain as \"Dougal and the Blue Cat\". The story centers around Dougal, who becomes suspicious when a blue cat arrives at the Magic Garden. It turned out the cat, named Buxton, was working for an unseen voice (named the Blue Voice) of an abandoned factory, who wanted to take over the garden and turn everything into the colour blue. Upon this takeover, the residents of the garden also ended up being imprisoned, except for Dougal, who made a plan to rescue his friends. Among the film's many highlights, Buxton made a disguised Dougal face his ultimate weakness by locking him in a room full of sugar. The Blue Voice was voiced by Fenella Fielding and was the only time that Eric Thompson called in another person to voice a character.\n2005 CGI film.\nIn 2005, a film adaptation (also called \"The Magic Roundabout\") was released. The movie was about Dougal, Ermintrude, Brian and Dylan going on a quest to stop Zebedee's evil twin Zeebad, who intends on creating an eternal winter. It was made using modern computer animation, and adopted the approach of the original creator, Serge Danot, of giving each character its own voice rather than using a narrator. The voices included Tom Baker, Joanna Lumley, Ian McKellen, Jim Broadbent, Kylie Minogue, Robbie Williams, Ray Winstone, Bill Nighy and Lee Evans. The film received mixed reviews, with a 50% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, while \"Total Film\" ranked it as the 45th worst children's movie ever made. The two-disc special edition of the UK DVD of the film features five of the original \"Magic Roundabout\" episodes (including the English version of \"Mr. Rusty Meets Zebedee\", the very first episode from 1965) on the second disc. They are all presented in the original black-and-white with the option of viewing them in English or in the original French.\nIn 2006, the film was released in the US as \"Doogal\". The majority of original British voices were replaced by celebrities more familiar to the American public, such as Whoopi Goldberg and Chevy Chase. Only two original voices remained: those of Kylie Minogue and Ian McKellen. The final North American version was panned. As of September 2020, it had an 8% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes. It received a score of 23 out of 100 (\"generally unfavorable\") on Metacritic, and an F rating from \"Entertainment Weekly\" magazine. It was also a financial failure, grossing a total of 7.2 million dollars in the United States, which is considered low by CGI animated film standards.\n2007 continuation as a TV series.\nIn 2007, a new TV version of \"The Magic Roundabout\" was created, with 52 x 11-minute episodes. The series was produced by Action Synthese, Films Action, Ellipsanime and Play Production with the participation of M6, Nickelodeon UK and Disney Television France. The scripts and voices were produced in the UK. The show was directed by Graham Ralph of Silver Fox Films and produced by Theresa Plummer Andrews.\nUsing the CGI designed versions of the original characters from the 2005 film also produced by Action Synthese, the only new characters taken from the film are Mr. Grimsdale the baker and Soldier Sam. The series takes place after the events of the 2005 film of the same name. The new series also created a few original characters of its own such as Fly and Dougal's Auntie Primrose.\nEvery episode would begin with Zebedee giving a brief summary to the audience of what will happen, before the plot begins. The episodes would also end with Zebedee throwing a party after the problems have been solved, with Dylan droopily remarking, \"I wish it was time for bed, man...\" (in reference to the original series' quote \"Time for bed\") before drifting off to sleep.\nThe series was first broadcast in the UK from 22 October 2007 at 8.00 am on satellite channel Nick Jr. It was also broadcast on the children's channel of China Central Television (CCTV-14) in Chinese during 2017 and was briefly available on Netflix in the US.\nIn October 2008, a Double DVD Bumper Pack Boxset of the 2007 reboot was released from Abbey Home Media, called \"Dougal's Darling and The Wishing Tree\". It featured 12 Season 1 episodes, all of which are in order except for the two titular episodes.\nIn 2010, a second season of 52 11-minute episodes was created. This season included ZDF as an additional participator.\nRecords.\nIn 1971, BBC Records released \"The Magic Roundabout\" (RBT 8), an LP containing 10 stories taken from the soundtracks of the TV series as told by Eric Thompson.

She is a five-time Olympic gold medalist, all in individual events. In 1976, at age 14, Com\u0103neci was the first gymnast to be awarded a perfect score of 10.0 at the Olympic Games. At the same Games (1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal), she earned six more perfect 10s for events en route to winning three gold medals. At the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow, Com\u0103neci won two more gold medals and achieved two more perfect 10s. During her career, Com\u0103neci won nine Olympic medals and four World Artistic Gymnastics Championship medals.\nOne of the world's best-known gymnasts, Com\u0103neci was praised for her artistry and grace, which brought unprecedented global popularity to the sport in the mid-1970s. Called \"the most iconic gymnast of the 20th century\" by \"El Pa\u00eds\", Com\u0103neci was named one of the Athletes of the 20th century by the Laureus World Sports Academy. In August 2024, the International Sports Press Association (AIPS) voted her as the best female gymnast of the past 100 years and the second best athlete of all sports after Serena Williams. \nCom\u0103neci has lived in the United States since 1989, when she defected from then-Communist Romania, before its revolution in December that year. Com\u0103neci later worked with and married American Olympic gold-medal gymnast Bart Conner \u2014 a wedding which was held in Bucharest after the fall of the Communist regime and televised live in Romania.\nEarly life.\nNadia Elena Com\u0103neci was born on November 12, 1961, in One\u0219ti, a small town in the Carpathian Mountains, in Bac\u0103u County, Romania, in the historical region of Western Moldavia. She was born to Gheorghe (1936\u20132012) and \u0218tefania Com\u0103neci, and has a younger brother named Adrian. Her parents separated in the 1970s and her father later moved to Bucharest, the capital. Com\u0103neci and Adrian were raised in the Romanian Orthodox Church. In a 2011 interview, her mother said that she enrolled Com\u0103neci into gymnastics classes because she was so full of energy and active as a child that she was difficult to manage. After years of top-level athletic competition, Com\u0103neci graduated from Politehnica University of Bucharest with a degree in sports education, which qualified her to coach gymnastics.\nGymnastics career.\nEarly gymnastics career.\nNadia began gymnastics in kindergarten with a local team called \"Flac\u0103r\u0103\" (\"The Flame\"), with coaches Duncan and Munteanu. At age six, she was chosen to attend B\u00e9la K\u00e1rolyi's experimental gymnastics school, after K\u00e1rolyi spotted her and a friend turning cartwheels in a schoolyard. K\u00e1rolyi was looking for gymnasts that he could train from a young age. When recess ended, the girls quickly went inside and K\u00e1rolyi went around the classrooms trying to find them; he eventually spotted Com\u0103neci. The other girl, Viorica Dumitru, developed in a different direction and became one of Romania's top ballerinas.\nBy 1968, when she was seven, Com\u0103neci started training with K\u00e1rolyi. She was one of the first students at the gymnastics school established in One\u0219ti by K\u00e1rolyi and his wife, M\u00e1rta. As a resident of the town, Com\u0103neci was able to live at home for many years; most of the other students boarded at the school.\nIn 1970, Com\u0103neci began competing as a member of her home town team, and at age nine, became the youngest gymnast ever to win the Romanian Nationals. The following year, she participated in her first international competition, a dual junior meet between Romania and Yugoslavia, winning her first all-around title and contributing to the team gold. For the next few years, Com\u0103neci competed as a junior in numerous national contests in Romania and dual meets with countries such as Hungary, Italy, and Poland. At age 11 in 1973, she won the all-around gold, as well as the vault and uneven bars titles, at the Junior Friendship Tournament (Druzhba), an important international meet for junior gymnasts.\nCom\u0103neci's first major international success came at age 13, when she nearly swept the board at the 1975 European Women's Artistic Gymnastics Championships in Skien, Norway. Com\u0103neci won the all-around and gold medals in every event but the floor exercise, finishing in second place. She continued to enjoy success that year, winning the all-around at the 'Champions All' competition and coming first in the all-around, vault, beam, and bars at the Romanian National Championships. In the pre-Olympic test event in Montreal, Com\u0103neci won the all-around and the balance beam golds as well as silvers in the vault, floor and bars. Accomplished Soviet gymnast Nellie Kim won the golds in those events and was one of Com\u0103neci's greatest rivals for the next five years.\n1976.\nAmerican Cup.\nIn March 1976, Com\u0103neci competed in the inaugural edition of the American Cup at Madison Square Garden in Manhattan. She received rare scores of 10, which signified a perfect routine without any deductions, for her vault in the preliminary stage and for her floor exercise routine in the final of the all-around competition, which she won. During this competition, Com\u0103neci met American gymnast Bart Conner for the first time. While he remembered this meeting, Com\u0103neci noted in her memoirs that she had to be reminded of it later in life. She was 14 and Conner was celebrating his 18th birthday. They both won a silver cup and were photographed together. A few months later, they participated in the 1976 Summer Olympics that Com\u0103neci dominated, while Conner was a marginal figure. Conner later said, \"Nobody knew me, and [Com\u0103neci] certainly didn't pay attention to me.\"\n1976 Summer Olympics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;At Montreal [Com\u0103neci] received four of her seven 10s on the uneven bars. The apparatus demands such a spectacular burst of energy in such a short time\u2014only 23 seconds\u2014that it attracts the most fanfare. But it is on the beam that her work seems more representative of her considerable skill. She scored three of her seven 10s on the beam. Her hands speak there as much as her body. Her pace magnifies her balance. Her command and distance hush the crowd.\u2014\u200a\nOn July 18, 1976, Com\u0103neci made history at the Montreal Olympics. During the team compulsory portion of the competition, she was awarded the first perfect 10 in Olympic gymnastics for her routine on the uneven bars. Omega SA, the official Olympics scoreboard manufacturer, had been led to believe that competitors could not receive a perfect 10, and had not programmed the scoreboard to display this score. Com\u0103neci's perfect 10 thus appeared as \"1.00\", the only means by which the judges could indicate that she had received a 10.\nDuring the remainder of the Montreal Games, Com\u0103neci earned six additional \"10s\". She won gold medals for the individual all-around, the balance beam and uneven bars. Com\u0103neci also won a bronze for the floor exercise and a silver as part of the team all-around. Soviet gymnast Nellie Kim was her main rival during the Montreal Olympics; Kim became the second gymnast to receive a perfect 10, in her case for her performance on the vault. Com\u0103neci took over the media spotlight from gymnast Olga Korbut, who had been the darling of the 1972 Munich Games.\nCom\u0103neci was the first Romanian gymnast to win the Olympic all-around title. She also holds the record as the youngest ever Olympic gymnastics all-around champion at age 14. The sport has since raised its age-eligibility requirements so that gymnasts must be at least 16 in the same calendar year of the Olympics in order to compete. When Com\u0103neci competed in 1976, gymnasts had only to be 14 by the first day of the competition. Unless the age of eligibility is lowered, her record cannot be broken.\nCom\u0103neci was ranked as the BBC Overseas Sports Personality of the Year for 1976 and the Associated Press' 1976 \"Female Athlete of the Year\". Back home in Romania, she was awarded the Sickle and Hammer Gold Medal for her success, and Com\u0103neci was named a Hero of Socialist Labor. She was the youngest Romanian to receive such recognition during the administration of Nicolae Ceau\u0219escu.\n\"Nadia's Theme\".\n\"Nadia's Theme\" refers to an instrumental piece that became linked to Com\u0103neci shortly after the 1976 Olympics. It was part of the musical score of the 1971 film \"Bless the Beasts and Children\" and originally titled \"Cotton's Dream\". It was also used as the title theme music for the American soap opera \"The Young and the Restless\".\nRobert Riger used it in association with slow-motion montages of Com\u0103neci on the television program \"ABC's Wide World Of Sports\". The song became a top-10 single in the fall of 1976, and composers Barry De Vorzon and Perry Botkin Jr. renamed it as \"Nadia's Theme\" in Com\u0103neci's honor. Com\u0103neci never performed to \"Nadia's Theme\", however. Her floor exercise music was a medley of the songs \"Yes Sir, That's My Baby\" and \"Jump in the Line\", arranged for piano.\n1977\u20131979.\nCom\u0103neci successfully defended her European all-around title at the championship competition in 1977. When questions were raised at the competition about the scoring, Ceau\u0219escu ordered the Romanian gymnasts to return home. The team followed orders amid controversy and walked out of the competition during the event finals.\nFollowing the 1977 Europeans, the Romanian Gymnastics Federation removed Com\u0103neci from her longtime coaches, the K\u00e1rolyis, and sent her to Bucharest on August 23 to train at the sports complex. Com\u0103neci did not find this change positive and was struggling with bodily changes as she grew older. Her gymnastics skills suffered, and Com\u0103neci was unhappy to the point of losing the desire to live. Com\u0103neci competed in the 1978 World Championships in Strasbourg four inches taller and according to Washington Post 22 pounds heavier than she was in the 1976 Olympics. A fall from the uneven bars resulted in a fourth-place finish in the all-around behind Soviets Elena Mukhina, Nellie Kim, and Natalia Shaposhnikova. Com\u0103neci did win the world title on beam, and a silver on vault.\nAfter the 1978 \"Worlds\", Com\u0103neci was permitted to return to Deva and the K\u00e1rolyis' school. In 1979, Com\u0103neci won her third consecutive European all-around title, becoming the first gymnast, male or female, to achieve this feat. At the World Championships in Fort Worth that December, Com\u0103neci led the field after the compulsory competition. She was hospitalized before the optional portion of the team competition for blood poisoning, which had resulted from a cut in her wrist from her metal grip buckle. Against doctors' orders, she left the hospital and competed on the beam, where she scored a 9.95. Her performance helped give the Romanians their first team gold medal. After her performance, Com\u0103neci spent several days recovering in All Saints Hospital. She had to undergo a minor surgical procedure for the infected hand, which had developed an abscess.\n1980\u20131984.\n1980 Summer Olympics.\nCom\u0103neci was chosen to participate in the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow. As a result of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, President Jimmy Carter declared that the United States would boycott the Olympics (several other countries also participated in the boycott, though their reasons varied). According to Com\u0103neci, the Romanian government \"touted the 1980 Olympic games as the first all-Communist Games.\" However, she also noted in her memoir, \"in Moscow, we walked into the mouth of a lion's den; it was the Russians' home turf.\" She had a fall to the mat during the uneven bars event of the team competition and was judged with only 9.50, but later, she was twice awarded a perfect 10, first on the balance beam seconded by another one on uneven bars. She won two gold medals, one for the balance beam and one for the floor exercise (in which she tied with Soviet gymnast Nellie Kim, against whom she had also competed in the 1976 Montreal Olympics and other events). She also won two silver medals, one for the team all-around and one for individual all-around. Controversies arose concerning the scoring in the all-around and floor exercise competitions. As of the 2020 Summer Games, she is the only gymnast to defend her Olympic gold medal in the balance beam apparatus.\nHer coach, Bela K\u00e1rolyi, protested that she was scored unfairly. His protests were captured on television. According to Com\u0103neci's memoir, the Romanian government was upset about K\u00e1rolyi's public behavior, feeling that he had humiliated them. Life became very difficult for K\u00e1rolyi from that point on.\n\"Nadia '81\".\nIn 1981, the Gymnastics Federation contacted Com\u0103neci and informed her that she would be part of an official tour of the United States named \"Nadia '81\" and her coaches B\u00e9la and M\u00e1rta K\u00e1rolyi would lead the group. During this tour, Com\u0103neci's team shared a bus trip with American gymnasts; it was the third time she had encountered Bart Conner. They had earlier met in 1976. She later remembered thinking, \"Conner was cute. He bounced around the bus talking to everyone\u2014he was incredibly friendly and fun.\"\nThe K\u00e1rolyis defected on the last day of the tour, along with the Romanian team choreographer G\u00e9za Pozs\u00e1r. Prior to defecting, K\u00e1rolyi hinted a few times to Com\u0103neci that he might attempt to do so and indirectly asked if she wanted to join him. At that time, she had no interest in defecting, and said she wanted to go home to Romania. After the defection of the K\u00e1rolyis, life changed drastically for Com\u0103neci in Romania, as she could not have predicted. Officials feared that she would also defect. Feeling she was a national asset, they strictly monitored her actions, refusing to allow her to travel outside the country.\n1984 Summer Olympics.\nThe government did allow Com\u0103neci to participate in the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles as part of the Romanian delegation. Although a number of Communist nations boycotted the 1984 Summer Olympics in a tit-for-tat against the U.S.-led boycott of the Olympics in Moscow four years before, Romania chose to participate. Com\u0103neci later wrote in her memoir that many believed Romania went to the Olympics because an agreement had been made with the United States not to accept defectors. But Com\u0103neci did not participate in the Games as a member of the Romanian team; she served as an observer. She was able to see K\u00e1rolyi's new prot\u00e9g\u00e9, American gymnast Mary Lou Retton, who won five medals, including one gold. The Romanian delegation did not allow her to talk with K\u00e1rolyi and closely watched her the entire time.\nRetirement.\nThe Romanian government continued to restrict Com\u0103neci from leaving Romania, aside from a few select trips to Moscow and Cuba. Throughout her career, she had been subjected to round-the-clock surveillance at the hands of the Securitate secret police. She had started thinking about retiring a few years earlier, but her official retirement ceremony took place in Bucharest in 1984. It was attended by the chairman of the International Olympic Committee.\nCom\u0103neci later wrote in her memoir:\nLife took on a new bleakness. I was cut off from making the small amount of extra money that had really made a difference in my family's life. It was also insulting that a normal person in Romania had the chance to travel, whereas I could not ... when my gymnastics career was over, there was no longer any need to keep me happy. I was to do as I was instructed, just as I'd done my entire life\u2026. If B\u00e9la hadn't defected, I would still have been watched, but his defection brought a spotlight on my life, and it was blinding. I started to feel like a prisoner.\nPersonal life.\nOn the night of November 27, 1989, a few weeks before the Romanian revolution, Com\u0103neci defected with a group of other Romanians, crossing the Hungary\u2013Romania border around Cenad. They were guided by Constantin Panait, a Romanian who later became an American citizen after defecting. Their journey was mostly on foot and at night. They traveled through Hungary and Austria and finally were able to take a plane to the United States. She was settled briefly in South Florida, then in Los Angeles and later lived in Montreal, Canada for nearly two years.\nCom\u0103neci moved to Oklahoma in 1991 to help her friend Bart Conner, another Olympic gold medalist, with his gymnastics school. She lived with the family of Paul Ziert and eventually hired him as her manager. Com\u0103neci and Conner were together for four years before they became engaged, marrying in 1996. She returned to Romania for their wedding, which was held in Bucharest. This was after the fall of the Communist regime and the establishment of a democratic Romania; the government welcomed her as a national hero. The wedding was televised live in Romania, and the couple's reception was held in the former presidential palace. Com\u0103neci became a naturalized US citizen in 2001 while retaining her Romanian citizenship. In 2006, the couple's son Dylan was born.\nOn May 18, 1997, Com\u0103neci and Conner guest-starred on the season 3 finale of \"Touched by an Angel\", titled \"A Delicate Balance\", where they performed a brief floor exercise within a montage scene.\nSince 1994, the Nadia Com\u0103neci International Invitational has welcomed gymnasts ranging from USAG level 4 to level 10. The competition also hosted international elite competition in the mid-2010s, with Rebeca Andrade being a notable attendee in 2013 among others.\nShe was the featured speaker at the 50th annual Independence Day Naturalization Ceremony on July 4, 2012, at Monticello, the first athlete invited to speak in the history of the ceremony.\nLeadership roles.\nCom\u0103neci is a famous figure in the world of gymnastics; she serves as the honorary president of the Romanian Gymnastics Federation, the honorary president of the Romanian Olympic Committee, the sports ambassador of Romania, and as a member of the International Gymnastics Federation Foundation. She and Conner own the Bart Conner Gymnastics Academy, the Perfect\u00a010 Production Company, and several sports equipment shops, and are the editors of \"International Gymnast Magazine\".\nShe is also still involved with the Olympic Games. During the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, one of her perfect-10 Montreal uneven bars routines was featured in a commercial for Adidas. In addition, both Com\u0103neci and her husband Bart Conner provided television commentary for the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing. A few years later, on July 21, 2012, Com\u0103neci, along with former basketball star John Amaechi, carried the Olympic torch to the roof of the O2\u00a0Arena as part of the torch relay for the 2012 Summer Olympics in London. Prior to the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Com\u0103neci appeared in a TIDE advertisement called \"The Evolution of Power\" with Simone Biles and three-time Olympic gymnast Dominique Dawes. She also offered daily analysis of the 2016 games (along with other Olympic champions such as Mark Spitz, Carl Lewis, and Conner), for the late-night show \"\u00c9 Campe\u00e3o,\" broadcast on Brazil's SporTV. On July 26, 2024, she participated in the opening ceremony of the 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris, alongside past Olympians Carl Lewis, Serena Williams, and Rafael Nadal, carrying the Olympic flame in the final stages of the torch relay up the river Seine to the Louvre museum on its way to the lighting of the Olympic cauldron in the Tuileries Garden.\nIn addition, Com\u0103neci is highly involved in fundraising for a number of charities. She personally funded the construction and operation of the Nadia Com\u0103neci Children's Clinic in Bucharest that provides low-cost and free medical and social support to Romanian children. In 2003, the Romanian government appointed her as an honorary consul general of Romania to the United States to deal with bilateral relations between the two nations. In addition, both Com\u0103neci and Conner are involved with the Special Olympics.\nTo raise money for charity, Com\u0103neci participated in the celebrity version of Donald Trump's reality show \"The Apprentice\". Com\u0103neci was a member of \"The Empresario\" team (all women), which lost to \"The Hydra\" team (all men) in the second episode. Trump responded to this loss by firing Com\u0103neci, Com\u0103neci later commented on her participation in the show, saying she \"had great fun. I only did it because it was all for charity.\"\nSkills.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nWith her trademark verve, graceful delivery and unflickering precision, the 14-year-old from Romania set the bar to which future generations of gymnasts would aspire.\"\n\u2013\"Lost Art: Powerhouse Physiques Winning Out over Spellbinding Grace\", \"The Herald\", 2015\nCom\u0103neci was known for her clean technique, innovative and difficult original skills, and her stoic, cool demeanor in competition. On the balance beam, she was the first gymnast to successfully perform an aerial cartwheel-back handspring series. She is also credited as being the first gymnast to perform a double-twist dismount. Her skills on the floor exercise included a tucked double back salto and a double twist.\nCom\u0103neci has two eponymous uneven bars skills listed in the Code of Points, the Com\u0103neci salto and the Com\u0103neci dismount.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCited sources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\nVideo clips:"}
{"id": "74327", "revid": "48970003", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=74327", "title": "Principle of relativity", "text": "Physics principle\nIn physics, the principle of relativity is the requirement that the equations describing the laws of physics have the same form in all admissible frames of reference.\nFor example, in the framework of special relativity, the Maxwell equations have the same form in all inertial frames of reference. In the framework of general relativity, the Maxwell equations or the Einstein field equations have the same form in arbitrary frames of reference.\nSeveral principles of relativity have been successfully applied throughout science, whether implicitly (as in Newtonian mechanics) or explicitly (as in Albert Einstein's special relativity and general relativity).\nBasic concepts.\nCertain principles of relativity have been widely assumed in most scientific disciplines. One of the most widespread is the belief that any law of nature should be the same at all times; and scientific investigations generally assume that laws of nature are the same regardless of the person measuring them. These sorts of principles have been incorporated into scientific inquiry at the most fundamental of levels.\nAny principle of relativity prescribes a symmetry in natural law: that is, the laws must look the same to one observer as they do to another. According to a theoretical result called Noether's theorem, any such symmetry will also imply a conservation law alongside. For example, if two observers at different times see the same laws, then a quantity called energy will be conserved. In this light, relativity principles make testable predictions about how nature behaves.\nSpecial principle of relativity.\nAccording to the first postulate of the special theory of relativity:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"Special principle of relativity\": If a system of coordinates K is chosen so that, in relation to it, physical laws hold good in their simplest form, the \"same\" laws hold good in relation to any other system of coordinates K' moving in uniform translation relatively to K.\u2014\u200a\nThis postulate defines an inertial frame of reference.\nThe special principle of relativity states that physical laws should be the same in every inertial frame of reference, but that they may vary across non-inertial ones. This principle is used in both Newtonian mechanics and the theory of special relativity. Its influence in the latter is so strong that Max Planck named the theory after the principle.\nThe principle requires physical laws to be the same for any body moving at constant velocity as they are for a body at rest. A consequence is that an observer in an inertial reference frame cannot determine an absolute speed or direction of travel in space, and may only speak of speed or direction relative to some other object.\nThe principle does not extend to non-inertial reference frames because those frames do not, in general experience, seem to abide by the same laws of physics. In classical physics, fictitious forces are used to describe acceleration in non-inertial reference frames.\nIn Newtonian mechanics.\nThe special principle of relativity was first explicitly enunciated by Galileo Galilei in 1632 in his \"Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems\", using the metaphor of Galileo's ship.\nNewtonian mechanics added to the special principle several other concepts, including laws of motion, gravitation, and an assertion of an absolute time. When formulated in the context of these laws, the special principle of relativity states that the laws of mechanics are \"invariant\" under a Galilean transformation.\nIn special relativity.\nJoseph Larmor and Hendrik Lorentz discovered that Maxwell's equations, used in the theory of electromagnetism, were invariant only by a certain change of time and length units. This left some confusion among physicists, many of whom thought that a luminiferous aether was incompatible with the relativity principle, in the way it was defined by Henri Poincar\u00e9:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The principle of relativity, according to which the laws of physical phenomena should be the same, whether for an observer fixed, or for an observer carried along in a uniform movement of translation; so that we have not and could not have any means of discerning whether or not we are carried along in such a motion.\u2014\u200a\nIn their 1905 papers on electrodynamics, Henri Poincar\u00e9 and Albert Einstein explained that with the Lorentz transformations the relativity principle holds perfectly. Einstein elevated the (special) principle of relativity to a postulate of the theory and derived the Lorentz transformations from this principle combined with the principle of the independence of the speed of light (in vacuum) from the motion of the source. These two principles were reconciled with each other by a re-examination of the fundamental meanings of space and time intervals.\nThe strength of special relativity lies in its use of simple, basic principles, including the invariance of the laws of physics under a shift of inertial reference frames and the invariance of the speed of light in vacuum. (See also: Lorentz covariance.)\nIt is possible to derive the form of the Lorentz transformations from the principle of relativity alone. Using only the isotropy of space and the symmetry implied by the principle of special relativity, one can show that the space-time transformations between inertial frames are either Galilean or Lorentzian. Whether the transformation is actually Galilean or Lorentzian must be determined with physical experiments. It is not possible to conclude that the speed of light \"c\" is invariant by mathematical logic alone. In the Lorentzian case, one can then obtain relativistic interval conservation and the constancy of the speed of light.\nGeneral principle of relativity.\nThe general principle of relativity states:&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;All systems of reference are equivalent with respect to the formulation of the fundamental laws of physics.\u2014\u200a\nThat is, physical laws are the same in all reference frames\u2014inertial or non-inertial. An accelerated charged particle might emit synchrotron radiation, though a particle at rest does not. If we consider now the same accelerated charged particle in its non-inertial rest frame, it emits radiation at rest.\nPhysics in non-inertial reference frames was historically treated by a coordinate transformation, first, to an inertial reference frame, performing the necessary calculations therein, and using another to return to the non-inertial reference frame. In most such situations, the same laws of physics can be used if certain predictable fictitious forces are added into consideration; an example is a uniformly rotating reference frame, which can be treated as an inertial reference frame if one adds a fictitious centrifugal force and Coriolis force into consideration.\nThe problems involved are not always so trivial. Special relativity predicts that an observer in an inertial reference frame does not see objects he would describe as moving faster than the speed of light. However, in the non-inertial reference frame of Earth, treating a spot on the Earth as a fixed point, the stars are observed to move in the sky, circling once about the Earth per day. Since the stars are light years away, this observation means that, in the non-inertial reference frame of the Earth, anybody who looks at the stars is seeing objects which appear, to them, to be moving faster than the speed of light.\nSince non-inertial reference frames do not abide by the special principle of relativity, such situations are not self-contradictory.\nGeneral relativity.\nGeneral relativity was developed by Einstein in the years 1907\u20131915. General relativity postulates that the global Lorentz covariance of special relativity becomes a local Lorentz covariance in the presence of matter. The presence of matter \"curves\" spacetime, and this curvature affects the path of free particles (and even the path of light). General relativity uses the mathematics of differential geometry and tensors in order to describe gravitation as an effect of the geometry of spacetime. Einstein based this new theory on the general principle of relativity and named the theory after the underlying principle.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes and references.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\nSee the special relativity references and the general relativity references."}

It consists mostly of sand dunes and is the third major island of the West Frisians. It neighbours islands Terschelling to the west and Schiermonnikoog to the east. This includes the small Engelsmanplaat and Rif sandbanks to the east.\nAmeland is, counted from the west, the fourth inhabited Dutch Wadden island and belongs to the Friesland (\"Frysl\u00e2n\") province. The whole island falls under one municipality, which carries the same name. The Wadden islands form the border between the North Sea and the Wadden Sea, which lies on the south side of the island file. The municipality of Ameland had a population of in . The inhabitants are called Amelanders.\nPlaces.\nThe island has four villages, and one small part-village.\nThere were two other villages: Oerd and Sier, but these were flooded and now lie in the sea. The name of these villages live on in MS \"Oerd\" and MS \"Sier\", which are the names of the ferries to the island. From west to east:\nPopulation.\nThe population of each village of the island as of 2017[ [update]]:\nHistory.\nFirst mentioned as Ambla in the 8th century, it paid tribute to the county of Holland until in 1424 its lord, Ritske Jelmera, declared it a \"free lordship\" (\"vrijheerschap\"): the Lordship of Ameland.\nAlthough Holland, Friesland and the Holy Roman Emperor contested this quasi-independent status, it remained a free lordship until the ruling family, Cammingha, died out in 1708. After that, the Frisian stadtholder John William Friso, Prince of Orange, became lord of Ameland and after him, his son the stadtholder of all the Netherlands, William IV, Prince of Orange, and his grandson, William V, Prince of Orange.\nOnly in the constitution of 1813 was the island finally integrated into the Netherlands into the province of Friesland. The monarchy of the Netherlands still maintain the title \"Vrijheer van Ameland\" today.\nIn 1871\u201372, a dike was built between Ameland and the mainland by a society for the reclamation of Frisian land from the sea. The dike ran from Holwert to Buren and was long. The province and the Dutch realm each paid 200,000 guilders. In the end, it was unsuccessful; the dike did not prove to be durable and in 1882, after heavy storms in the winter, repairs and maintenance of the dam were stopped. The dike can still be partially seen at low tide. The dam at Holwert is the beginning of this dike.\nIn 1940, German troops were ferried to the island and within hours Ameland was under the control of the German Army. Due to its limited military value, the Allies never invaded Ameland. The German forces on the island did not surrender until 2 June 1945, almost a full month after the defeat of Nazi Germany.\n2023 MV \"Fremantle Highway\" fire.\nIn July 2023, a fire on the Panamanian flagged cargo ship MV \"Fremantle Highway\" carrying over 3,700 cars off the coast of Ameland left one sailor dead and 22 others injured.\nNature.\nLike all West and East Frisian Islands, Ameland is a unique piece of nature. The profusion of different plants on the island is caused by the immense variety of landscapes. One of the scenic areas is the Oerd, a large complex of dunes which is still expanding by the year. Because of the differing landscapes and types of flora, over 60 different species of birds are sitting there every year. At the eastern part of the Oerd lies a beach plain called the Hon.\nBesides dunes and beaches, Ameland has some woods, like the \"Nesser bos\" (\"Wood of Nes\").\nTransport.\nMost travelers reach the island by ferry from Holwert on the mainland of Friesland, but there is also an airport near Ballum (Ameland Airport). A bus service connects the ferries from Hollum/Ballum (route 130) and Buren/Nes (route 132). When the sea between Friesland and Ameland is at low tide, one can walk across (see mudflat hiking).\nNotable people.\nThe following people were born on Ameland:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "74331", "revid": "12472594", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=74331", "title": "Andromeda Galaxy", "text": "Barred spiral galaxy in the Local Group\nThe Andromeda Galaxy is a barred spiral galaxy and is the nearest major galaxy to the Milky Way. It was originally named the Andromeda Nebula and is cataloged as Messier 31, M31, and NGC 224. Andromeda has a D25 isophotal diameter of about and is approximately from Earth. The galaxy's name stems from the area of Earth's sky in which it appears, the constellation of Andromeda, which itself is named after the princess who was the wife of Perseus in Greek mythology.\nThe virial mass of the Andromeda Galaxy is of the same order of magnitude as that of the Milky Way, at . The mass of either galaxy is difficult to estimate with any accuracy, but it was long thought that the Andromeda Galaxy was more massive than the Milky Way by a margin of some 25% to 50%. However, this has been called into question by early-21st-century studies indicating a possibly lower mass for the Andromeda Galaxy and a higher mass for the Milky Way. The Andromeda Galaxy has a diameter of about , making it the largest member of the Local Group of galaxies in terms of extension.\nThe Milky Way and Andromeda galaxies have about a 50% chance of colliding with each other in the next 10\u00a0billion years, merging to potentially form a giant elliptical galaxy or a large lenticular galaxy.\nWith an apparent magnitude of 3.4, the Andromeda Galaxy is among the brightest of the Messier objects, and is visible to the naked eye from Earth on moonless nights, even when viewed from areas with moderate light pollution.\nObservation history.\nThe Andromeda Galaxy is visible to the naked eye in dark skies. It has been speculated that the Babylonian constellation of the Rainbow, Mul Dingir Tir-an-na, may have referred to M31. Around the year 964 CE, the Persian astronomer Abd al-Rahman al-Sufi described the Andromeda Galaxy in his \"Book of Fixed Stars\" as a \"nebulous smear\" or \"small cloud\". This was the first historical reference to the Andromeda Galaxy and the earliest known reference to a galaxy other than the Milky Way. Star charts of that period labeled it as the \"Little Cloud\". In 1612, the German astronomer Simon Marius gave an early description of the Andromeda Galaxy based on telescopic observations. John Flamsteed cataloged it as 33 Andromedae. Pierre Louis Maupertuis conjectured in 1745 that the blurry spot was an island universe. Charles Messier cataloged Andromeda as object M31 in 1764 and incorrectly credited Marius as the discoverer despite it being visible to the naked eye. In 1785, the astronomer William Herschel noted a faint reddish hue in the core region of Andromeda. He believed Andromeda to be the nearest of all the \"great nebulae,\" and based on the color and magnitude of the nebula, he incorrectly guessed that it was no more than 2,000 times the distance of Sirius, or roughly .\nIn 1850, William Parsons, 3rd Earl of Rosse, made a drawing of Andromeda's spiral structure.\nIn 1864, William Huggins noted that the spectrum of Andromeda differed from that of a gaseous nebula. The spectrum of Andromeda displays a continuum of frequencies, superimposed with dark absorption lines that help identify the chemical composition of an object. Andromeda's spectrum is very similar to the spectra of individual stars, and from this, it was deduced that Andromeda has a stellar nature. In 1885, a supernova (known as S Andromedae) was seen in Andromeda, the only one ever observed in that galaxy. At the time, it was called \"Nova 1885\"\u2014the difference between \"novae\" in the modern sense and supernovae was not yet known. Andromeda was considered to be a nearby object, and it was not realized that the \"nova\" was much brighter than ordinary novae.\nIn 1888, Isaac Roberts took one of the first photographs of Andromeda, which was still commonly thought to be a nebula within the Milky Way galaxy. Roberts mistook Andromeda and similar \"spiral nebulae\" as star systems being formed.\nIn 1912, Vesto Slipher used spectroscopy to measure the radial velocity of Andromeda with respect to the Solar System\u2014the largest velocity yet measured, at .\n\"Island universes\" hypothesis.\nAs early as 1755, the German philosopher Immanuel Kant proposed the hypothesis that the Milky Way is only one of many galaxies in his book \"Universal Natural History and Theory of the Heavens\". Arguing that a structure like the Milky Way would look like a circular nebula viewed from above and like an ellipsoid if viewed from an angle, he concluded that the observed elliptical nebulae like Andromeda, which could not be explained otherwise at the time, were indeed galaxies similar to the Milky Way, not nebulae, as Andromeda was commonly believed to be.\nIn 1917, Heber Curtis observed a nova within Andromeda. After searching the photographic record, 11 more novae were discovered. Curtis noticed that these novae were, on average, 10 magnitudes fainter than those that occurred elsewhere in the sky. As a result, he was able to come up with a distance estimate of . Although this estimate is about fivefold lower than the best estimates now available, it was the first known estimate of the distance to Andromeda that was correct to within an order of magnitude (i.e., to within a factor of ten of the current estimates, which place the distance around 2.5\u00a0million light-years). Curtis became a proponent of the so-called \"island universes\" hypothesis: that spiral nebulae were actually independent galaxies.\nIn 1920, the Great Debate between Harlow Shapley and Curtis took place concerning the nature of the Milky Way, spiral nebulae, and the dimensions of the universe. To support his claim that the Great Andromeda Nebula is, in fact, an external galaxy, Curtis also noted the appearance of dark lanes within Andromeda that resembled the dust clouds in the Milky Way galaxy, as well as historical observations of the Andromeda Galaxy's significant Doppler shift. In 1922, Ernst \u00d6pik presented a method to estimate the distance of Andromeda using the measured velocities of its stars. His result placed the Andromeda Nebula far outside the Milky Way at a distance of about . Edwin Hubble settled the debate in 1925 when he identified extragalactic Cepheid variable stars for the first time on astronomical photos of Andromeda. These were made using the Hooker telescope, and they enabled the distance of the Great Andromeda Nebula to be determined. His measurement demonstrated conclusively that this feature was not a cluster of stars and gas within the Milky Way galaxy, but an entirely separate galaxy located a significant distance from the Milky Way.\nIn 1943, Walter Baade was the first person to resolve stars in the central region of the Andromeda Galaxy. Baade identified two distinct populations of stars based on their metallicity, naming the young, high-velocity stars in the disk Type I and the older, red stars in the bulge Type II. This nomenclature was subsequently adopted for stars within the Milky Way and elsewhere. (The existence of two distinct populations had been noted earlier by Jan Oort.) Baade also discovered that there were two types of Cepheid variable stars, which resulted in doubling the distance estimate to Andromeda, as well as the remainder of the universe.\nIn 1950, radio emissions from the Andromeda Galaxy were detected by Robert Hanbury Brown and Cyril Hazard at the Jodrell Bank Observatory. The first radio maps of the galaxy were made in the 1950s by John Baldwin and collaborators at the Cambridge Radio Astronomy Group. The core of the Andromeda Galaxy is called 2C 56 in the 2C radio astronomy catalog.\nIn 1959 rapid rotation of the semi-stellar nucleus of M31 was discovered by Andre Lallemand, M. Duschene and Merle Walker at the Lick Observatory, using the 120-inch telescope, coud\u00e9 Spectrograph, and Lallemand electronographic camera. They estimated the mass of the nucleus to be about 1.3 x 107 solar masses. The second example of this phenomenon was found in 1961 in the nucleus of M32 by M.F Walker at the Lick Observatory, using the same equipment as used for the discovery of the nucleus of M31. He estimated the nuclear mass to be between 0.8 and 1 x 107 solar masses. Such rotation is now considered to be evidence of the existence of supermassive black holes in the nuclei of these galaxies.\n21st century.\nIn 2009, an occurrence of microlensing\u2014a phenomenon caused by the deflection of light by a massive object\u2014may have led to the first discovery of a planet in the Andromeda Galaxy.\nIn 2020, observations of linearly polarized radio emission with the Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope, the Effelsberg 100-m Radio Telescope, and the Very Large Array revealed ordered magnetic fields aligned along the \"10-kpc ring\" of gas and star formation.\nIn 2023, amateur astronomers Marcel Drechsler, Xavier Strottner and Yann Sainty announced the discovery of a huge, oxygen-rich emission nebula just south of M31, near the bright star 35 And. This nebula, now classified as SDSO-1, is exceedingly faint, requiring dozens of hours of exposure time minimum to detect, and appears to only emit in oxygen-III. Deep studies of the surrounding regions showed no signs of similarly bright oxygen nebulae near M31, nor any sign of connecting hydrogen filaments to SDSO-1, suggesting a high oxygen-hydrogen ratio. Current research suggests SDSO-1 is extragalactic in nature, specifically caused by interaction between the Milky Way's and M31's circumgalactic halos, although more research is needed to fully understand this object. A later study using spectroscopy found the nebula to be in the Milky Way. One study found the nebula to be a bow shock of a ghost planetary nebula around the binary EG Andromedae.\nIn 2025, NASA published a huge mosaic made by the Hubble Space Telescope, assembled from approximately 600 separate overlapping fields of view taken over 10 years of Hubble observation. Hubble resolves an estimated 200 million stars that are hotter than the Sun, but still a fraction of the galaxy's total estimated stellar population.\nGeneral.\nThe estimated distance of the Andromeda Galaxy from our own was doubled in 1953 when it was discovered that there is a second, dimmer type of Cepheid variable star. In the 1990s, measurements of both standard red giants as well as red clump stars from the \"Hipparcos\" satellite measurements were used to calibrate the Cepheid distances.\nFormation and history.\nA major merger occurred 2 to 3\u00a0billion years ago at the Andromeda location, involving two galaxies with a mass ratio of approximately 4.\nThe discovery of a recent merger in the Andromeda galaxy was first based on interpreting its anomalous age-velocity dispersion relation, as well as the fact that 2\u00a0billion years ago, star formation throughout Andromeda's disk was much more active than today.\nModeling of this violent collision shows that it has formed most of the galaxy's (metal-rich) galactic halo, including the Giant Stream, and also the extended thick disk, the young age thin disk, and the static 10 kpc ring. During this epoch, its rate of star formation would have been very high, to the point of becoming a luminous infrared galaxy for roughly 100 million years. Modeling also recovers the bulge profile, the large bar, and the overall halo density profile.\nAndromeda and the Triangulum Galaxy (M33) might have had a very close passage 2\u20134\u00a0billion years ago, but it seems unlikely from the last measurements from the Hubble Space Telescope.\nDistance estimate.\nAt least four distinct techniques have been used to estimate distances from Earth to the Andromeda Galaxy. In 2003, using the infrared surface brightness fluctuations (I-SBF) and adjusting for the new period-luminosity value and a metallicity correction of \u22120.2 mag dex\u22121 in (O/H), an estimate of was derived. A 2004 Cepheid variable method estimated the distance to be 2.51 \u00b1 0.13\u00a0million light-years (770 \u00b1 40 kpc).\nIn 2005, an eclipsing binary star was discovered in the Andromeda Galaxy. The binary is made up of two hot blue stars of types O and B. By studying the eclipses of the stars, astronomers were able to measure their sizes. Knowing the sizes and temperatures of the stars, they were able to measure their absolute magnitude. When the visual and absolute magnitudes are known, the distance to the star can be calculated. The stars lie at a distance of and the whole Andromeda Galaxy at about . This new value is in excellent agreement with the previous, independent Cepheid-based distance value. The TRGB method was also used in 2005 giving a distance of . Averaged together, these distance estimates give a value of .\nMass estimates.\nUntil 2018, mass estimates for the Andromeda Galaxy's halo (including dark matter) gave a value of approximately M\u2609, compared to M\u2609 for the Milky Way. This contradicted even earlier measurements that seemed to indicate that the Andromeda Galaxy and Milky Way are almost equal in mass. In 2018, the earlier measurements for equality of mass were re-established by radio results as approximately M\u2609. In 2006, the Andromeda Galaxy's spheroid was determined to have a higher stellar density than that of the Milky Way, and its galactic stellar disk was estimated at twice the diameter of that of the Milky Way. The total mass of the Andromeda Galaxy is estimated to be between M\u2609 and M\u2609. The stellar mass of M31 is M\u2609, with 30% of that mass in the central bulge, 56% in the disk, and the remaining 14% in the stellar halo. The radio results (similar mass to the Milky Way Galaxy) should be taken as likeliest as of 2018, although clearly, this matter is still under active investigation by several research groups worldwide.\nAs of 2019, current calculations based on escape velocity and dynamical mass measurements put the Andromeda Galaxy at M\u2609, which is only half of the Milky Way's newer mass, calculated in 2019 at M\u2609.\nIn addition to stars, the Andromeda Galaxy's interstellar medium contains at least M\u2609 in the form of neutral hydrogen, at least M\u2609 as molecular hydrogen (within its innermost 10 kiloparsecs), and M\u2609 of dust.\nThe Andromeda Galaxy is surrounded by a massive halo of hot gas that is estimated to contain half the mass of the stars in the galaxy. The nearly invisible halo stretches about a million light-years from its host galaxy, halfway to our Milky Way Galaxy. Simulations of galaxies indicate the halo formed at the same time as the Andromeda Galaxy. The halo is enriched in elements heavier than hydrogen and helium, formed from supernovae, and its properties are those expected for a galaxy that lies in the \"green valley\" of the Galaxy color-magnitude diagram (see below). Supernovae erupt in the Andromeda Galaxy's star-filled disk and eject these heavier elements into space. Over the Andromeda Galaxy's lifetime, nearly half of the heavy elements made by its stars have been ejected far beyond the galaxy's 200,000-light-year-diameter stellar disk.\nLuminosity estimates.\nThe estimated luminosity of the Andromeda Galaxy, L\u2609, is about 25% higher than that of our own galaxy. However, the galaxy has a high inclination as seen from Earth, and its interstellar dust absorbs an unknown amount of light, so it is difficult to estimate its actual brightness and other authors have given other values for the luminosity of the Andromeda Galaxy (some authors even propose it is the second-brightest galaxy within a radius of 10 megaparsecs of the Milky Way, after the Sombrero Galaxy, with an absolute magnitude of around \u221222.21 or close).\nAn estimation done with the help of Spitzer Space Telescope published in 2010 suggests an absolute magnitude (in the blue) of \u221220.89 (that with a color index of +0.63 translates to an absolute visual magnitude of \u221221.52, compared to \u221220.9 for the Milky Way), and a total luminosity in that wavelength of L\u2609.\nThe rate of star formation in the Milky Way is much higher, with the Andromeda Galaxy producing only about one solar mass per year compared to 3\u20135 solar masses for the Milky Way. The rate of novae in the Milky Way is also double that of the Andromeda Galaxy. This suggests that the latter once experienced a great star formation phase, but is now in a relative state of quiescence, whereas the Milky Way is experiencing more active star formation. Should this continue, the luminosity of the Milky Way may eventually overtake that of the Andromeda Galaxy.\nAccording to recent studies, the Andromeda Galaxy lies in what is known in the galaxy color\u2013magnitude diagram as the \"green valley\", a region populated by galaxies like the Milky Way in transition from the \"blue cloud\" (galaxies actively forming new stars) to the \"red sequence\" (galaxies that lack star formation). Star formation activity in green valley galaxies is slowing as they run out of star-forming gas in the interstellar medium. In simulated galaxies with similar properties to the Andromeda Galaxy, star formation is expected to extinguish within about five billion years, even accounting for the expected, short-term increase in the rate of star formation due to the collision between the Andromeda Galaxy and the Milky Way.\nStructure.\nBased on its appearance in visible light, the Andromeda Galaxy is classified as an SA(s)b galaxy in the de Vaucouleurs\u2013Sandage extended classification system of spiral galaxies. However, infrared data from the 2MASS survey and the Spitzer Space Telescope showed that Andromeda is actually a barred spiral galaxy, like the Milky Way, with Andromeda's bar major axis oriented 55 degrees anti-clockwise from the disc major axis.\nThere are various methods used in astronomy in defining the size of a galaxy, and each method can yield different results concerning one another. The most commonly employed is the D25 standard, the isophote where the photometric brightness of a galaxy in the B-band (445\u00a0nm wavelength of light, in the blue part of the visible spectrum) reaches 25 mag/arcsec2. The Third Reference Catalogue of Bright Galaxies (RC3) used this standard for Andromeda in 1991, yielding an isophotal diameter of at a distance of 2.5\u00a0million light-years. An earlier estimate from 1981 gave a diameter for Andromeda at .\nA study in 2005 by the Keck telescopes shows the existence of a tenuous sprinkle of stars, or galactic halo, extending outward from the galaxy. The stars in this halo behave differently from the ones in Andromeda's main galactic disc, where they show rather disorganized orbital motions as opposed to the stars in the main disc having more orderly orbits and uniform velocities of 200\u00a0km/s. This diffuse halo extends outwards away from Andromeda's main disc with the diameter of .\nThe galaxy is inclined an estimated 77\u00b0 relative to Earth (where an angle of 90\u00b0 would be edge-on). Analysis of the cross-sectional shape of the galaxy appears to demonstrate a pronounced, S-shaped warp, rather than just a flat disk. A possible cause of such a warp could be gravitational interaction with the satellite galaxies near the Andromeda Galaxy. The Galaxy M33 could be responsible for some warp in Andromeda's arms, though more precise distances and radial velocities are required.\nSpectroscopic studies have provided detailed measurements of the rotational velocity of the Andromeda Galaxy as a function of radial distance from the core. The rotational velocity has a maximum value of at from the core, and it has its minimum possibly as low as at from the core. Further out, rotational velocity rises out to a radius of , where it reaches a peak of . The velocities slowly decline beyond that distance, dropping to around at . These velocity measurements imply a concentrated mass of about M\u2609 in the nucleus. The total mass of the galaxy increases linearly out to , then more slowly beyond that radius.\nThe spiral arms of the Andromeda Galaxy are outlined by a series of HII regions, first studied in great detail by Walter Baade and described by him as resembling \"beads on a string\". His studies show two spiral arms that appear to be tightly wound, although they are more widely spaced than in our galaxy. His descriptions of the spiral structure, as each arm crosses the major axis of the Andromeda Galaxy, are as follows\u00a7pp1062\u00a7pp92:\nSince the Andromeda Galaxy is seen close to edge-on, it is difficult to study its spiral structure. Rectified images of the galaxy seem to show a fairly normal spiral galaxy, exhibiting two continuous trailing arms that are separated from each other by a minimum of about and that can be followed outward from a distance of roughly from the core. Alternative spiral structures have been proposed such as a single spiral arm or a flocculent pattern of long, filamentary, and thick spiral arms.\nThe most likely cause of the distortions of the spiral pattern is thought to be interaction with galaxy satellites M32 and M110. This can be seen by the displacement of the neutral hydrogen clouds from the stars.\nIn 1998, images from the European Space Agency's Infrared Space Observatory demonstrated that the overall form of the Andromeda Galaxy may be transitioning into a ring galaxy. The gas and dust within the galaxy are generally formed into several overlapping rings, with a particularly prominent ring formed at a radius of from the core, nicknamed by some astronomers the \"ring of fire\". This ring is hidden from visible light images of the galaxy because it is composed primarily of cold dust, and most of the star formation that is taking place in the Andromeda Galaxy is concentrated there.\nLater studies with the help of the Spitzer Space Telescope showed how the Andromeda Galaxy's spiral structure in the infrared appears to be composed of two spiral arms that emerge from a central bar and continue beyond the large ring mentioned above. Those arms, however, are not continuous and have a segmented structure.\nClose examination of the inner region of the Andromeda Galaxy with the same telescope also showed a smaller dust ring that is believed to have been caused by the interaction with M32 more than 200 million years ago. Simulations show that the smaller galaxy passed through the disk of the Andromeda Galaxy along the latter's polar axis. This collision stripped more than half the mass from the smaller M32 and created the ring structures in Andromeda.\nIt is the co-existence of the long-known large ring-like feature in the gas of Messier 31, together with this newly discovered inner ring-like structure, offset from the barycenter, that suggested a nearly head-on collision with the satellite M32, a milder version of the Cartwheel encounter.\nStudies of the extended halo of the Andromeda Galaxy show that it is roughly comparable to that of the Milky Way, with stars in the halo being generally \"metal-poor\", and increasingly so with greater distance. This evidence indicates that the two galaxies have followed similar evolutionary paths. They are likely to have accreted and assimilated about 100\u2013200 low-mass galaxies during the past 12\u00a0billion years. The stars in the extended halos of the Andromeda Galaxy and the Milky Way may extend nearly one-third the distance separating the two galaxies.\nNucleus.\nThe Andromeda Galaxy is known to harbor a dense and compact star cluster at its very center, similar to the Milky Way galaxy. A large telescope creates a visual impression of a star embedded in the more diffuse surrounding bulge. In 1991, the Hubble Space Telescope was used to image the Andromeda Galaxy's inner nucleus. The nucleus consists of two concentrations separated by . The brighter concentration, designated as P1, is offset from the center of the galaxy. The dimmer concentration, P2, falls at the true center of the galaxy and contains an embedded star cluster, called P3, containing many UV-bright A-stars and the supermassive black hole, called M31*. The black hole is classified as a low-luminosity AGN (LLAGN) and it was detected only in radio wavelengths and in x-rays. It was quiescent in 2004\u20132005, but it was highly variable in 2006\u20132007. An additional x-ray flare occurred in 2013. The mass of M31* was measured at 3\u20135 \u00d7 107 M\u2609 in 1993, and at 1.1\u20132.3 \u00d7 108 M\u2609 in 2005. The velocity dispersion of material around it is measured to be \u2248 .\nIt has been proposed that the observed double nucleus could be explained if P1 is the projection of a disk of stars in an eccentric orbit around the central black hole. The eccentricity is such that stars linger at the orbital apocenter, creating a concentration of stars. It has been postulated that such an eccentric disk could have been formed from the result of a previous black hole merger, where the release of gravitational waves could have \"kicked\" the stars into their current eccentric distribution. P2 also contains a compact disk of hot, spectral-class A stars. The A stars are not evident in redder filters, but in blue and ultraviolet light they dominate the nucleus, causing P2 to appear more prominent than P1.\nWhile at the initial time of its discovery it was hypothesized that the brighter portion of the double nucleus is the remnant of a small galaxy \"cannibalized\" by the Andromeda Galaxy, this is no longer considered a viable explanation, largely because such a nucleus would have an exceedingly short lifetime due to tidal disruption by the central black hole. While this could be partially resolved if P1 had its own black hole to stabilize it, the distribution of stars in P1 does not suggest that there is a black hole at its center.\nDiscrete sources.\nApparently, by late 1968, no X-rays had been detected from the Andromeda Galaxy. A balloon flight on 20 October 1970 set an upper limit for detectable hard X-rays from the Andromeda Galaxy. The Swift BAT all-sky survey successfully detected hard X-rays coming from a region centered 6 arcseconds away from the galaxy center. The emission above 25 keV was later found to be originating from a single source named 3XMM J004232.1+411314, and identified as a binary system where a compact object (a neutron star or a black hole) accretes matter from a star.\nMultiple X-ray sources have since been detected in the Andromeda Galaxy, using observations from the European Space Agency's (ESA) XMM-Newton orbiting observatory. Robin Barnard \"et al.\" hypothesized that these are candidate black holes or neutron stars, which are heating the incoming gas to millions of kelvins and emitting X-rays. Neutron stars and black holes can be distinguished mainly by measuring their masses. An observation campaign of NuSTAR space mission identified 40 objects of this kind in the galaxy.\nIn 2012, a microquasar, a radio burst emanating from a smaller black hole was detected in the Andromeda Galaxy. The progenitor black hole is located near the galactic center and has about 10 M\u2609. It was discovered through data collected by the European Space Agency's XMM-Newton probe and was subsequently observed by NASA's Swift Gamma-Ray Burst Mission and Chandra X-Ray Observatory, the Very Large Array, and the Very Long Baseline Array. The microquasar was the first observed within the Andromeda Galaxy and the first outside of the Milky Way Galaxy.\nGlobular clusters.\nThere are approximately 460 globular clusters associated with the Andromeda Galaxy. The most massive of these clusters, identified as Mayall II, nicknamed Globular One, has a greater luminosity than any other known globular cluster in the Local Group of galaxies. It contains several million stars and is about twice as luminous as Omega Centauri, the brightest known globular cluster in the Milky Way. Mayall II (also known as Globular One or G1) has several stellar populations and a structure too massive for an ordinary globular. As a result, some consider Mayall II to be the remnant core of a dwarf galaxy that was consumed by Andromeda in the distant past. The cluster with the greatest apparent brightness is G76 which is located in the southwest arm's eastern half.\nAnother massive globular cluster, named 037-B327 (also known as Bol 37) and discovered in 2006 as is heavily reddened by the Andromeda Galaxy's interstellar dust, was thought to be more massive than Mayall II and the largest cluster of the Local Group; however, other studies have shown it is actually similar in properties to Mayall II.\nUnlike the globular clusters of the Milky Way, which show a relatively low age dispersion, Andromeda Galaxy's globular clusters have a much larger range of ages: from systems as old as the galaxy itself to much younger systems, with ages between a few hundred million years to five billion years.\nIn 2005, astronomers discovered a completely new type of star cluster in the Andromeda Galaxy. The new-found clusters contain hundreds of thousands of stars, a similar number of stars that can be found in globular clusters. What distinguishes them from the globular clusters is that they are much larger\u2014several hundred light-years across\u2014and hundreds of times less dense. The distances between the stars are, therefore, much greater within the newly discovered extended clusters.\nThe most massive globular cluster in the Andromeda Galaxy, B023-G078, likely has a central intermediate black hole of almost 100,000 solar masses.\nPA-99-N2 event and possible exoplanet in galaxy.\nPA-99-N2 was a microlensing event detected in the Andromeda Galaxy in 1999. One of the explanations for this is the gravitational lensing of a red giant by a star with a mass between 0.02 and 3.6 times that of the Sun, which suggested that the star is likely orbited by a planet. This possible exoplanet would have a mass 6.34 times that of Jupiter. If finally confirmed, it would be the first ever found extragalactic planet. However, anomalies in the event were later found.\nNearby and satellite galaxies.\nLike the Milky Way, the Andromeda Galaxy has smaller satellite galaxies, consisting of over 20 known dwarf galaxies. The Andromeda Galaxy's dwarf galaxy population is very similar to the Milky Way's, but the galaxies are much more numerous. The best-known and most readily observed satellite galaxies are M32 and M110. Based on current evidence, it appears that M32 underwent a close encounter with the Andromeda Galaxy in the past. M32 may once have been a larger galaxy that had its stellar disk removed by M31 and underwent a sharp increase of star formation in the core region, which lasted until the relatively recent past.\nM110 also appears to be interacting with the Andromeda Galaxy, and astronomers have found in the halo of the latter a stream of metal-rich stars that appear to have been stripped from these satellite galaxies. M110 does contain a dusty lane, which may indicate recent or ongoing star formation. M32 has a young stellar population as well.\nThe Triangulum Galaxy is a non-dwarf galaxy that lies 750,000 light-years from Andromeda. It is currently unknown whether it is a satellite of Andromeda.\nIn 2006, it was discovered that nine of the satellite galaxies lie in a plane that intersects the core of the Andromeda Galaxy; they are not randomly arranged as would be expected from independent interactions. This may indicate a common tidal origin for the satellites.\nCollision with the Milky Way.\nThe Andromeda Galaxy is approaching the Milky Way at about per second. It has been measured approaching relative to the Sun at around as the Sun orbits around the center of the galaxy at a speed of approximately . This makes the Andromeda Galaxy one of about 100 observable blueshifted galaxies. Andromeda Galaxy's tangential or sideways velocity concerning the Milky Way is uncertain, but estimated to be smaller than the approaching velocity. After the sideways velocity was first measured, Andromeda was predicted to collide directly with the Milky Way in about 4\u00a0billion years. However, later calculations, including a higher sideways velocity measurement from the Gaia (spacecraft) and the effect of other Local Group galaxies found a much lower probability of a merger.\nA likely outcome of the collision would be that the galaxies will merge to form a giant elliptical galaxy or possibly large disc galaxy. Such events are frequent among the galaxies in galaxy groups. The fate of Earth and the Solar System in the event of a collision is currently unknown. Before the galaxies merge, there is a small chance that the Solar System could be ejected from the Milky Way or join the Andromeda Galaxy.\nAmateur observation.\nUnder most viewing conditions, the Andromeda Galaxy is one of the most distant objects that can be seen with the naked eye, due to its sheer size. (M33 and, for observers with exceptionally good vision, M81 can be seen under very dark skies.)\nThe constellation of Andromeda, in which the galaxy is located, is usually found with the aid of the constellations Cassiopeia or Pegasus, which are usually easier to recognize at first glance.\nAndromeda is best seen during autumn nights in the Northern Hemisphere when it passes high overhead, reaching its highest point around midnight in October, and two hours earlier each successive month. In the early evening, it rises in the east in September and sets in the west in February.\nFrom the Southern Hemisphere the Andromeda Galaxy is visible between October and December, best viewed from as far north as possible. Binoculars can reveal some larger structures of the galaxy and its two brightest satellite galaxies, M32 and M110. An amateur telescope can reveal Andromeda's disk, some of its brightest globular clusters, dark dust lanes, and the large star cloud NGC 206.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is closely associated with the Real World Records record label, Real World Publishing, and the WOMAD Festival, whose offices are also based at the complex.\nHistory.\nIn 1986, following the success of his album \"So\", Peter Gabriel decided to pursue a permanent recording facility. Knowing that he wanted to remain in the same area as the Ashcombe House that he had been renting, and that he wanted the new location to be close to running water, Gabriel looked at several sites, mostly old mills, near Bath. A 13-acre site in the village of Box featured the By Brook and several existing buildings, including Box Mill, a 200-year-old water mill that had been converted to offices in the 1950s. Gabriel purchased the site and its buildings from Spafax in 1987.\nGabriel's vision for the new studio was a unified space where everyone could work together, where musicians aren't separated from the engineer or producer. Additionally, he wanted these creative spaces to have elements of light, air, and water. Working with architectural design firm FCBStudios, the existing buildings were converted and a new building ('The Big Room') was added. The new complex provided both recording studio facilities and residential accommodations.\nFacility.\nThe largest recording space, appropriately referred to as the Big Room, is a 2,000 square foot combination live room and control room with a custom wraparound 72-channel SSL 9000 XL K Series mixing console at its centre, with large windows offering expansive views of the adjacent millpond and gardens. Although the Big Room has a separate machine room and two isolation booths, it is designed as one large collaborative recording space with no dividing walls. Alternately, the Big Room also functions as a Dolby Surround 7.1-certified film mixing room.\nAdjoining the Big Room and within the former mill building is the Wood Room. This room utilizes a 24-channel SSL AWS 924 console, and features a more lively acoustic character, mezzanine floor and movable acoustic screens, as well as its own isolation booth. The Big Room and The Wood Room can be booked together for a larger recording space, or individually for smaller or lower-budget projects. Also available is the Rehearsal Room\u2014a 49 foot by 16 foot space for rehearsals or pre-production.\nThe Red Room is a dedicated mixing and production room well-suited for post-production, ADR recording, and mixing for television and film. A Foley stage is also present in the room.\nThe studio also has the Writing Room and the Workroom, which are Gabriel's own private workspaces. The Workroom, which is equipped with a talkback system, multitrack recording capabilities, and MIDI/video connection to other rooms in the facility, has also been made available for other clients to rent in the past; one of Gabriel's managers said in a 1992 interview with \"EQ\" magazine that \"when we get a booking we just kick him out\". \nClients.\nNotable clients of Real World Studios include A-ha, Alicia Keys, Amy Winehouse, Beyonc\u00e9, Bj\u00f6rk, Black Grape, Blue October, Bonnie Raitt, Chris de Burgh, Coldplay, Daniel Lanois, Deep Purple, Foals, Goldfrapp, Harry Styles, Idles, Indigo Girls, James, James Morrison, Jay-Z, Joseph Arthur, Kanye West, Kasabian, Katie Melua, King Crimson, Kylie Minogue, Laura Marling, Loreena McKennitt, Maggie Rogers, Marillion, Melanie C, Mumford &amp; Sons, Natalie Duncan, New Order, Paloma Faith, Paolo Nutini, Papa Wemba, Paul Simon, Periphery, Pixies, Placebo, The Pretenders, Rag'n'Bone Man, Reef, Robert Plant, Roger Waters, Sade, Seal, Sia, Squid, Stereophonics, Suzi Quatro, Take That, Therapy?, Tom Jones, Toto, Ultravox, Van Morrison, The Vamps, Wet Wet Wet, and The 1975.\nReal World Studios has been host to film and TV projects including \"Quantum of Solace\", \"The Golden Compass\", \"Green Zone\" and \"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency.\"\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
