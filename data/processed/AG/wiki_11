Young, and Arthur Zegart. It premiered at the giant-screen IMAX theater of the National Air and Space Museum, which opened to celebrate the United States Bicentennial. The film chronicles the history of aviation in the US, with a narration written by Thomas McGrath. Thematically, it explores the search for national identity through the country's westward expansion as well as humanity's relationship with aviation.\nThe idea of the film was proposed in 1970 and revisited two years later following the museum's interest in an IMAX theater for the planned building. MacGillivray and Freeman expanded a treatment written by the Smithsonian Institution and Thompson, adding various scenes in the storyboard intended to jolt IMAX audiences. Due to the large dimensions of the screens, the filmmakers aimed for immersion and clarity via novel cinematographic techniques. This was further enhanced by the surround sound design. The ending space sequence, featuring the first IMAX rocket launch scene, was made with various experimental special effects. The film was edited by MacGillivray and Freeman, and features a score composed by Bernardo Segall. It was finished on schedule in two years, with a low US$590,000 fund from Conoco.\n\"To Fly!\" was released on July 1, 1976, distributed by Lawrence Associates and Conoco. It was initially scheduled to screen only for the Bicentennial, but due to public demand was kept indefinitely. In response to these demands, a 20th-anniversary special edition was released in 1996. The film led to an increase in the number of IMAX theaters worldwide and helped popularizing the nascent format, with various intense reactions observed among audiences, and was thus included in the National Film Registry and IMAX Hall of Fame. It also set MacGillivray as a major IMAX filmmaker. With increasing popularity, \"To Fly!\" remained among the highest-grossing giant-screen documentaries. Critics praised the film in its audiovisual and narrative aspects\u2014though some were negative on the latter\u2014and it received several accolades.\nSummary.\n\"To Fly!\" begins in Vermont on July 4, 1831. After reciting a zestful quatrain declaring himself a pioneer, a fictional hot air balloonist named Ezekiel ascends on a voyage around New England. Spectators below look at the balloon in awe and surprise. Ezekiel sees a canoeist heading to whitewater at Horseshoe Falls and warns him to shore to avoid the rapid.\nThe film then chronicles the history of aviation, beginning with hot air balloons. Its advent is described by the narrator as \"like the opening of a new eye\", allowing humans to reach untouched places and extend their limits, furthering their perspectives about the world. Despite this, the majority of Americans still used horses; for speedier travel, trains were invented, then cars and powered aircraft. The Roaring Twenties saw the rise of barnstorming, expanding access to aviation among Americans. As part of diversifying aviation, military jets were created, thereupon forming aerobatic teams like the Blue Angels. The use of jetliners made travel faster, and the American territory expanded beyond the mainland. Then, ultralight aviation was invented.\nAfter describing the human imagination as limitless due to a philosophical awakening from the aerial view of the world, \"To Fly!\" lastly depicts the Saturn IB rocket launch for the Apollo\u2013Soyuz mission at the Kennedy Space Center on July 15, 1975. Dubbing spaceflight a globally historical feat, the film suggests it can be used in finding extraterrestrial intelligence. The film ends with the narration:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;We have come a long way from the time when people gazed enviously upon the birds in-flight. Today, we look upon our planet from afar, and feel a new tenderness for the tiny and fragile Earth. For we know now, that even as we walk upon the ground, we are ever in-flight through the universe. And so, we begin to realize that human destiny has ever been, and always must be, to fly!\nProduction.\nBackground.\nThe Smithsonian Institution made efforts starting in 1911 to modernize its museums with multimedia content, though this only accelerated since the 1960s. The idea of a giant-screen theater at the National Air and Space Museum (NASM) was mooted in 1970 in a 153-page report by the National Museum of Natural History's (NMNH) curator team, which argued the museum needed a \"contemporary medium of communications\" that will resonate intellectually and psychologically. It suggested an experiential film that would showcase the American landscape and the country's introduction to technology, ending with predictions of the country's future. Among these giant-screen film formats was IMAX, characterized by its tall screen which fills the audiences' peripheral vision, triggering immersive telepresence which creates the illusion of being present within the film's setting. The NMNH proposed a panoramic, curved IMAX screen that envelops its rotunda, but this was discarded.\nIn 1972, the deputy director of the Smithsonian, Melvin B. Zisfein, wrote a memo praising IMAX over other giant-screen formats like Cinerama and Circle-Vision 360\u00b0, and suggested making an IMAX film for the NASM. Several film treatments were written, the first titled \"The Beautiful Mysteries of Flight\", though all were rejected. A year later, IMAX's co-founder Graeme Ferguson expressed interest in an IMAX film for the US Bicentennial, also considering the possibility of it being feature-length. In 1974, after hearing about plans for a new building of the NASM at the National Mall in Washington, D.C. as part of the Bicentennial, he proposed this to the museum director Michael Collins. While Ferguson believed this would enhance the museum, Collins had not seen an IMAX film and initially rejected the proposal. However, at Expo '74, an IMAX representative convinced him to go to the IMAX theater and see Ferguson's film \"Man Belongs to the Earth\"; he became convinced that an IMAX theater would provide a sense of realism to visitors and accepted the idea.\nPre-production.\nOn July 1, 1974, giant-screen filmmaker Francis Thompson joined in proposing a film about the history of flight for the Bicentennial at the NASM theater. With a US$590,000 fund from the Continental Oil Company (Conoco), with an additional $160,000 for film rights, they set the production deadline to 1976. After writing a third treatment with Thompson, the Smithsonian commissioned filmmaker duo Greg MacGillivray and James \"Jim\" Freeman, who had previously made surf and giant-screen films with experimental editing; they had also shot aerials for \"Jonathan Livingston Seagull\" (1973) and \"The Towering Inferno\" (1974). Collins told them that he did not want the film to be too history-oriented and instead be more fun. With Collins giving them full creative freedom, pre-production meetings took place in New York City for several months.\nCollins and Zisfein gave around 30 suggestions, about 20 of which were incorporated into the film. MacGillivray and Freeman thought the treatment was imperfect and expanded it into a narrative docudrama with several moments of comedy. They analyzed the existing IMAX films for inspiration, including \"Man Belongs to the Earth\", whose opening aerial shot of the Grand Canyon enthused them. Per Collins, they included scenes with comic relief in \"To Fly!\" in order to not make the film feel like a dry historical drama. Thompson agreed, saying there were enough fact-based Bicentennial films being made and that people needed more entertainment. MacGillivray said IMAX is perfect for the film because it \"allows me [...] to impact the audience in a greater way\". He and Freeman storyboarded it with John Divers at their Laguna Beach, California, office, creating \"IMAX moments\" to thrill audiences and to rely on visuals more than narration. Seven months were spent on research, with aviators Walter J. Boyne and Donald S. Lopez Sr. as technical advisors.\nActor and real-life balloonist Peter Walker was chosen to portray Ezekiel due to his comic charm. The character was based upon a balloonist who in 1790 apparently made flights over New England while reciting self-written poems, purportedly to impress young women. Walker listed \"To Fly!\" among his favorite films to star in. Through filmmaker Randal Kleiser, whom he knew from his friend Basil Poledouris, MacGillivray partook in courses with actress Nina Foch to master in directing his cast. Extras were not mandated to speak because they comprise locals, some of whom the filmmakers felt were amateur. Freeman's girlfriend Cindy Huston, MacGillivray's girlfriend Barbara Smith, and production manager-costumer Jeff Blyth made cameo appearances as different characters. Huston was also focus puller, and Smith was production assistant, craft service specialist, and unit still photographer. Other writers were Thompson, Robert M. Young, and Arthur Zegart; Thomas McGrath wrote the narration. Additionally, Byron McKinney was executive producer. Documentarian and historian Jon Wilkman was briefly involved, alongside NASA, the Office of Naval Research, and the California Institute of Technology.\nFilming.\nPrincipal photography occurred for five months in 1975. Filming paused two and a half months later during June for MacGillivray and Freeman to film the action scenes of \"Sky Riders\" (1976), then resumed for two and a half months. They directed and cinematographed the film, frequently switching roles and working seven days a week with a 5a.m. to 9p.m. shooting schedule. They often filmed together in a multiple-camera setup, like in one of the barnstorming shots. According to MacGillivray, \"To Fly!\" was the most fun film that he and Freeman worked on throughout their 11 years of partnership.\nAt the time, IMAX cameras weighed and felt \"crude\" to the filmmakers, dismaying them as they wanted to experiment with the cinematography. Furthermore, they were worried about damaging the only camera available to them, and wanted to minimize the need for retakes. Ferguson and fellow IMAX co-founders, Bill Shaw and Robert Kerr, ideated creating three new cameras with better specifications, with one of them to be used for Thompson in his other Bicentennial film, \"American Years\". Ferguson granted the proposal. When filming an aerial scene in \"American Years\", the camera's parachute failed to deploy, destroying it. The pre-existing camera was also modified to be on par with the new ones.\nTo make the film bright, colorful, and naturalistic, the crew used the Eastman Color Negative 5254 tungsten 65\u00a0mm film stock, with the opening scene in 35\u00a0mm. The costly stock caused the short duration of 27 minutes. To give a dramatic look, they emphasized the characters with cross-backlighting or crosslighting. Because of IMAX's large screens and where the perceived center would be, many novel techniques were implemented. Extreme long shots were treated as wide-angle shots, while the latter were treated as normal shots, and close-ups were treated as medium close-ups. The latter has a wider headroom for visual comfort. Movement was condensed to ease the switching between an extreme long shot to medium close-up, and a wide-angle lens was used to further expand the film's view. Camera lenses were also carefully chosen, ranging from the fisheye 30\u00a0mm to the telephoto 600\u00a0mm. Pentax and Hasselblad lenses were used; the latter had their focal lengths changed, shutters removed, and mounts modified. It took three months to test them and the camera magazines. However, they had no zoom lenses which MacGillivray said would have eased filming.\nMany shots in the film were time-consuming to make: a 35-second shot of the Blue Angels flying over the Colorado River and Yuma Desert took over four months to choreograph. Camera mounts were designed by the United States Navy for a McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II piloted by Kevin O'Mara used to film the shot. Nelson Tyler spent two months developing two mounts for the camera helicopters to film front and side shots, providing smoothness as the smallest vibrations would be noticeable on IMAX. The helicopters were piloted by George Nolan, Chuck Phillips, and Adrian Brooks. Mounts were also made by Boeing for the Boeing\u00a0747; they used its first prototype. Art Scholl's \"Super Chipmunk\" aircraft was used to film front shots. The Navy donated helium for the hot air balloon, thanks to the Blue Angels' presence in the film. The balloon, in shots where it actually flies, was piloted by Kurt Stehling, with whom MacGillivray has collaborated in \"Above San Francisco\" (1973).\nAerial work platforms were used to support the balloon basket and camera; two platforms supported the basket as it moved in opposing directions to heighten the illusion of flight. The balloon was decorated with 13 American flags, the number of states in the US in 1831, sewn by a vexillography shop. To create a shot in which a Sierra No. 3 train seemingly hits the camera, inspired by the allegedly jolting effects of \"L'Arriv\u00e9e d'un train en gare de La Ciotat\" (1895), the crew placed a mirror in a diagonal position at the rail facing towards the camera, which imaged the mirror for a symmetrical view of the rail as the train approached and shattered it. The illusion of pilots flying was made by filming close-ups of the aircraft backdropped by the sky while the camera dawdles within a rigid camera dolly. Bob Wills flew a hang glider above the N\u0101 Pali coastline.\nVarious kinds of transportation were used. In one scene, a stagecoach races with the train; previously there is a Conestoga wagon. Frank Tallman flew a Curtiss Model D for the mechanical flight scene. A Ford Model T was used in the scene talking about the invention of cars; the succeeding scene was filmed above Coastal California. The Blue Angels flew Douglas A-4 Skyhawks. Aerials of the 747 were filmed from a provided 737. With the theme of westward expansion, the iconic 630-foot-tall (192 m) Gateway Arch is flown through in St. Louis. Other filming locations included Lake Powell, Monument Valley, Zion Canyon, Yosemite Falls, the Appalachian Mountains, and the Sierra Nevada. The barnstorming scene was filmed in California, and the opening sequence's forests in Parsons, West Virginia. Filming also occurred in Alaska and Craftsbury, Vermont. A barn raising scene from the opening was cut from the final release. Overall, of film stock were used.\nSpace sequence.\n\"To Fly!\"'s space sequence depicts the launch of the Saturn IB, before showing a fictional spaceship voyaging around the Solar System. Five nebulae are then depicted before ending with a view of Earth.\nThe filmmakers were given permission to film the launch, marking the first time such was filmed in IMAX. They took this part more seriously because it could not be repeated. After filming away from the launch pad, they left their camera outside for a day, forming condensation inside and exacerbated by seasonal thunderstorms. It was found wet and jammed, and the crew spent three hours cleaning it to recover the recording. Meanwhile, a shot of the Saturn V's interstage ring jettisonning back to Earth was filmed in 16 mm film from the actual rocket's second stage, during Apollo 4 in 1967.\nWith a low budget, they initially conceived the space sequence as merely a compilation of astronomical images but realized they needed some kind of movement for an IMAX film, and thus saved money on the live-action filming in order to achieve a better space sequence. They expected \"To Fly!\" to be compared with the film \"\" (1968), and tried to make the sequence as reminiscent of that film as possible. They learned that small objects like stars on an IMAX screen are much smaller on a traditional presentation, and typical small stars would be oversized in IMAX; after some difficulty, they were able to create perfect-sized stars on an Kodalith negative sheet film. Because of the nature of IMAX, filming some scenes at six and twelve frames per second (fps) was preferred over stop motion. George Casey and Lester Novros of special effects company Graphic Films provided planetary models and a studio, and also assisted the crew.\nThe spaceship seen was a transparent portion of a larger model built by MacGillivray and Freeman, backlit on a glass frame. As special effects supervisor, Blyth designed it to have the same color palette as the 747, and inspired by concepts of advanced ion thrusters and magnetically confined fusions like deuterium and helium-3. It took 150 hours to create, with Collins as technical advisor. For a shot in which the spaceship passes Jupiter and Io, the crew filmed each object one by one; the film would be rewound back to layer in the next object. The camera was placed on a motorized dolly. Some shots, including the one of Saturn, were filmed at an animation stand. Others used a faux version of the slit-scan photography kit used for \"2001: A Space Odyssey\": the sheet film was projected onto a white board, which the fisheye-lensed camera was put close to. Models were attached to a peg bar, near where their glass frame was suspended on. To film extreme slow shots with distinct movement, a geared head and a zoom-motored gear were used, creating a slight pan. They filmed all these on 16\u00a0mm first to see if it could be done on IMAX.\nBellows and close-up lenses by Hasselblad were used for the penultimate nebulae shots; the camera was facing a tray filled with water and a mixture of black ink and white enamel paint lit by color gels. The materials' temperature, thickness, size, and type had to be precise to achieve the reaction. Unable to film at the desired 96 fps, mineral oil and paint thinner were poured into the tray to slow down movement; the thinner was favored because it created more interesting 3D-like movements. Often, a short wire was shaped and dipped in to create specific patterns. Special effects designers Jim Palmer and Barney Kaelin created laser patterns, the first in any IMAX film. Overall, the space sequence took four and a half months to prepare, test, and film.\nPost-production.\n\"To Fly!\" was edited by MacGillivray and Freeman, with Alexander Hammid supervising, using a Moviola. Knowing they would experiment with the editing, the film's shots were directed beforehand to allow them to do so. The pacing of the shots was designed so that audiences can explore the entire IMAX screen. The 35\u00a0mm opening where Ezekiel is still at ground is windowboxed to 1\u20446th of the screen; as he ascends, the scene smash-dissolves and the whole screen is filled, intendedly to intensify the scene's mood and as a reference to aviation, which the narration calls \"like the opening of a new eye\". This was inspired by the opening scenes of \"This Is Cinerama\" (1952) and the first ever IMAX film \"North of Superior\" (1971).\nThe placing of multiple images on the same screen were occasionally used; these were inspired by the multi-image films \"In the Labyrinth\" (1967) and \"Tiger Child\" (1970), made by IMAX's precursor Multiscreen. In one scene of the Blue Angels, the screen divides into 36 duplicates of the same shot. With IMAX screens having a different focus center, thus making an evenly-divided multi-image scene confusing for audiences, Jim Liles of the Optical Department at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and filmmaker Dennis Earl Moore designed new mattes in which the bottom row is 15% larger than the top. Smith supervised the curation of archival and original footage to be incorporated into these scenes. After four months of editing, two Norelco AAII 70/35\u00a0mm projectors were installed to preview in the highest quality possible.\nMacGillivray chose the film's score to be composed and conducted by Bernardo Segall. It was performed by a 49-piece symphony orchestra at the Burbank Studios which he considered \"the most professional and experienced\" in California that he could find. Segall's works were described by MacGillivray as having \"an air of sophistication and elegance, which would maintain the steady rhythm and pulse of the film\". The score was the first in history to use a keyed bugle, which is also depicted in the film's opening scene: at the gathering for Ezekiel's ascent, a small fanfare band plays a fife, drum, clarinet, and B\u266d keyed bugle. The score was then edited by Richard R. McCurdy and mixed by Dan Wallin. It was recorded in 16 channels and then downmixed to three of the six channels on a 35\u00a0mm sound follower, which would play in sync with the picture in theaters.\nSound design was done at Todd-AO's Hollywood, Los Angeles, studio. Sam Shaw edited the sound effects while Ray West and Jack Woltz mixed them. Some scenes in the film were made solely to exploit IMAX's sound technology. For example, a multi-image scene in which two jets cross each other uses the surround nature of the sound system; MacGillivray expected audiences to \"shiver\" due to the dramatic shift of attention. In the train screen-hitting shot, the horn and engine noise gradually surround the audience. Joseph Ellison also helped with the sound design, which completed on June 18, 1976. After post-production, which\u2014combined with the space sequence production\u2014took six months, Conoco applauded the film's rough cut. The company's investors and the Smithsonian gave input for the final cut, which spanned more than of film stock.\nThemes and style.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;;\n\"To Fly\" is [...] about the uncontaminated America that we all long to see and have so much trouble finding. [It] edit[ed] out the deteriorations of which we are daily more conscious at ground level. [...] The weather is always perfect. We never get to see a rundown city, a huge and outmoded industrial complex or a countryside [...] ruined forever. [It] is what the historians call \"nature's nation\".\n \u2014John Russell\n, \"The New York Times\" (1980)\n\"To Fly!\" is described as a hegemonic film on how the imagination of the American people pioneered aviation, illustrated with scenes of aircraft flying over various American landscapes. Film critic Daniel Eagan said most of the views depicted in its opening sequence are \"stately, processional, celebrating the American landscape while remaining distant from it\". From there, the film explores the US, triggering \"some patriotic empathy.\" It was also viewed as a nationalist film, linking the American quest for national identity to the development of aviation through metanarratives like the linear, westward journey of Americans. Like other early IMAX films, its omniscient visual rhetoric is most distinct in the space sequence. The film generally shies away from the Industrial Revolution's effects on the US in favor of displaying untouched nature. The Smithsonian said that \"To Fly!\"'s theme is: \"Flight, in all its forms, is part of the Human condition, part of our Destiny\". This refers to manifest destiny, a mythic cultural belief that propelled the westward expansion.\nCollins said \"To Fly!\"'s style makes it \"a break from the learning going on in the rest of the museum\", and NASM board members said it is an amplification of visitors' fascination of flying after seeing the museum's exhibits. Film author Alison Griffiths agreed, saying that as an add-on to a museum admission, whereas the exhibits give visitors information and interest, the film gives them a sense of wonder for aviation in an effect akin to synesthesia. This is achieved through its immersive cinematography, which provides viewers with vicarious participation. Steve McKerrow of \"The Baltimore Sun\" opined certain scenes reference classic films: the train screen-hitting scene is similar to the one from \"The Great Train Robbery\" (1903); the hot air balloon scenes are reminiscent of \"Around the World in 80 Days\" (1956); and the barnstorming scene is seemingly set in the same field as the \"North by Northwest\" (1959) crop duster chase scene. As a travelogue film of the US, \"To Fly!\" was also compared to the closing sequence of \"This Is Cinerama\". The aerial shots of various lands also signify aviation's usage in cartography, reconnaissance, resource exploration, land-use planning, and navigation.\nRelease.\nNASM.\nThe first press announcements of \"To Fly!\" were issued on May 16, 1976, and the film was previewed to members of the US Congress on June 24 at the NASM's IMAX theater (later renamed Samuel Pierpoint Langley, then Lockheed Martin). Two days prior to the preview, Freeman died in a helicopter crash while finding locations for a commercial at the Sierra Nevada. Grief-stricken, MacGillivray initially doubted he could continue filmmaking but decided to retain, keeping the company's name, MacGillivray Freeman Films (MFF), as a tribute.\n\"To Fly!\" premiered on July 1, 1976, labeled as sponsored by Conoco. The New York City-based Lawrence Associates handled theatrical distribution. With underwriting concerns, the Smithsonian prohibited Conoco from using the Smithsonian's name for commercial uses, but granted \"limited right\" to use Conoco's name for it. It was later relabeled as sponsored by parent company DuPont. MacGillivray assisted the inexperienced projectionists and frequently visited the booth to ensure that the film roll was in consistently mint condition. A Pachelbel's Canon rendition was played as an overture; it was praised as being memorable and evocative. \"The Washington Post\" credited the film alongside \"Ordinary People\" (1980) for the music's popularity. The NASM also released pin-back buttons depicting a hot air balloon, manufactured by Horn Co.\nThe film was initially scheduled for a one-year run, as were other Bicentennial films, but was retained due to high demand. At times, there were 14 shows daily. In the 1990s, attempts were made again to remove \"To Fly!\", but due to public grievances it was decided that a special edition be made in conjunction with the theater's digital sound system upgrade, released for its 20th anniversary in 1996. The audio was digitally remastered with new sound effects, a new narrator, and alterations of the score such as trimming, editing, and adding choral sounds. The Lake Powell-Monument Valley scene and space sequence have their music changed, and two existential narrations from the space sequence were cut. Celebrating its silver jubilee in 2001, a screening was made free. During its 35th anniversary in 2011, screenings were charged at 50 cents for adults and 25 cents for children, the same price up to the 1980s; in 1976, it was charged at $1 for adults and 50 cents for children, but fearing they were making too much profit, it was halved six months later. The Airbus IMAX Theater of the NASM's annex, the Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center, has also been screening \"To Fly!\".\nOther venues.\n\"To Fly!\" spurred the mass construction of IMAX theaters in various countries. The Smithsonian later also built an IMAX theater at the NMNH. Due to the film's intrigue, especially the transformative opening sequence, various museums established IMAX theaters. Other screening formats include the dome-shaped Omnimax and the digital IMAX with Laser. For the first 15 months since its opening in April 1983, \"To Fly!\" was the only film shown at the IMAX theater at the National Museum of Photography, Film &amp; Television (NMPFT) in Bradford, England, and its reception made them retain the theater. It was rescreened in 2013 for the museum's 30th anniversary. Michael Kernan of \"The Washington Post\" credited word of mouth to the popularity because advertising was mainly via brochures, newspapers, and television. MacGillivray noted a 1981 \"Today\" interview of him and Thompson by Tom Brokaw as among the things that led to the film's continued popularity, though said he did not expect such popularity.\nSeveral theaters played the film in a double feature, like the NASM and American Museum of Natural History's Naturemax Theater (February 11, 1982), who bundled it with \"Living Planet\" (1979) and \"Man Belongs to the Earth\". The NASM later replaced \"Living Planet\" with MFF's \"Speed\" (1984). \"To Fly!\" was put with \"Blue Planet\" (1990) at the Montreal and Maryland Science Center as they similarly showcase spaceflight. It was also the premiere film for IMAX theaters of theme parks like Six Flags Great America's Pictorium (1979), Dreamworld in Gold Coast, Australia (1981), and Speelland Beekse Bergen at Hilvarenbeek, Netherlands (June 19, 1981). Dreamworld founder John Longhurst was inspired to build the theater after seeing \"To Fly!\".\nOverall, the film has screened in over 24 countries, including Germany, Japan, Mexico, and Indonesia (Keong Emas IMAX Theater, Jakarta). It has been translated to 10 languages and screened at around 150 theaters worldwide. It was also shown in festivals like the 1976 Toronto International Film Festival, who took it from the Edinburgh International Film Festival, and the 2019 IMAX Victoria Film Festival who made a double feature with \"North of Superior\" titled \"The Dawn of IMAX Filmmaking\". Conoco also distributed \"To Fly!\" to schools, organizations, and non-IMAX theaters after September 6, 1976 (Labor Day), but the lack of non-IMAX screenings made it unpopular among filmgoers. They also sent 16\u00a0mm copies of the film to all 600 existing independent television stations in the US to be aired for free, as a marketing strategy. On May 28, 2023, the non-IMAX theater Cleveland Cinematheque put it together with MFF's \"Great Barrier Reef\" (2018) and \"Great Bear Rainforest\" (2019), in a series of MFF double features.\nHome media.\nIn 1985, \"To Fly!\" was released on videocassette formats Betamax and VHS, while its LaserDisc was in 1991 by Lumivision, catalog number LVD9113. The latter, as well as a VHS of the anniversary edition by IMAX subsidiary DKP 70MM Inc., features Dolby Surround-encoded audio. On March 20, 2011, the first VHS was preserved at the Hagley Museum and Library and is freely available at their finding aid website. For the VHS, the windowboxed opening scene was zoomed to fill the entire screen, and a large portion of the opening drum roll was cut. Together with the LaserDisc and second VHS, the film is cropped to the television aspect ratio, in lieu of the slightly wider IMAX 1.44:1. On October 7, 2021, MFF launched a streaming service called Movies For Families and included \"To Fly!\"'s anniversary edition, cropped to the widescreen ratio of . The multi-image scenes were re-adjusted, like the 36-duplicate shot which became 30.\nReception.\nBox office.\n\"To Fly!\" is regarded as the first blockbuster IMAX film. Over one million people watched it during its first year at the NASM, with approximately 80% of its 485 seats occupied. Initially, Collins had projected three and a half NASM visitors to view it. By 1980, it amassed more than 6.3 million viewers, with an average seat occupation of 77%, growing to 6.5 million by 1983. Over 15 million people have watched it at the museum; 4 million of which were in its three years, then 4.5 million the following year. By 1982, around 100 million audiences were recorded across the US. By 1991, over 100 million people have viewed \"To Fly!\" at schools and on television. In 1996, \"CBS This Morning\" dubbed \"To Fly!\" \"the longest-running ticketed film in one location in history\" and reported that it accumulated over 300 million views worldwide. From 2000 to 2012, there was an audience addition of 1.5 million at the NASM. Overall, the film is the longest-exhibited documentary and sponsored film in the world.\nMuseums like the NASM and NMPFT used early earnings of the film to underwrite expenses, maintain theaters, and/or fund IMAX films. It grew from $20\u00a0million in 1993\u2014thus being the 14th highest-grossing independently distributed film in the US and Canada (excluding erotic films)\u2014 to $100\u00a0million in 1999. Up to 2000, it earned $50 million in the NASM alone. \"To Fly!\" was the third highest-grossing IMAX documentary as of 2002, earning $113\u00a0million, behind \"The Dream is Alive\" (1985, $150\u00a0million) and MFF's \"Everest\" (1998, $114\u00a0million). It gained a net addition of $2.7\u00a0million up to early 2003, then a gross $900,000 throughout the year, and another $11.3\u00a0million up to 2011. In between that, \"The Numbers\" reported over $86.6\u00a0million within the US and Canada and $34.1\u00a0million elsewhere, totaling at $120.7\u00a0million. This meant the film became the second-highest-grossing 1976 film behind \"Rocky\", which earned $117.2\u00a0million, and above \"A Star is Born\", which earned $63.1\u00a0million. MFF reported an overall $135\u00a0million gross as of December 2019,3 thus being the company's second highest-grossing documentary film after \"Everest\".\nCritical response.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;;\nCan you really call yourself a Washingtonian if you haven't seen \"To Fly\"?\n\u2014John Kelly, \"The Washington Post\" (2016)\n\"To Fly!\" was well-received by many film critics; John Alderson of the \"Chicago Sun-Times\" summarized that \"the subject charms its imagination, while the IMAX format goes right to the brink of sensory overload\". Contemporary critics called it underrated and electric, with David Handler of the Newspaper Enterprise Association dubbing it \"the ultimate film trip\". \"The Washington Post\" called it an icon of the city and a must-watch to all Washingtonians. The film was cited by scholars and authors as examplifying the role of screen size in amplifying a film's kinesthetic thrills. Some called \"To Fly!\" one of the best IMAX films, with guides like the \"Michelin Green Guide\" and one by \"BioScience\" calling it a must-watch for those planning to visit the NASM.\nThe cinematography was praised for its innovativeness and vertiginous aesthetics, equated to theme park rides and epic films, which was further amplified by Segall's score. \"The Tampa Tribune\" rated the film three out of four stars, deeming the Horseshoe Falls and barnstorming scenes the best. The opening scene was praised for being banal which effectively shocks audiences during the giant-screen transition. Donna Whitehead of \"Norwalk News\" called it intimate and stellar, and the ending uplifting. John Russell, an art critic for \"The New York Times\", credited the cinematography to the audiences' immersion in the story, which progressively improves throughout the film. Critics called it poetic and paean-like, citing its expressive depictions of nature and aviation. The film's vintage-contemporary duality was credited by \"The Gaffney Ledger\" for its nostalgic weight. Nathan Southern of AllMovie gave the film four and a half stars out of five, deeming it a visually vivid historical insight and \"one of the greatest unsung landmarks of American documentary\". As the filmmakers intended, Alderson likened the space sequence to that of \"2001: A Space Odyssey\".\nThe narration was praised as personal and meditative, though others found it cursory and superfluous. Some critics panned Ezekiel's character as banal and mawkish, and the omissions of real-life aviation pioneers were noted, alongside how in some shots the balloon appears to be immobile. Filmmaker Mark R. Hasan thought the Betamax audio lacks quality in the dialogue, though he noted the film is highly degraded on videocassette from the original, and said \"To Fly!\" excels starting from the barnstorming scene. While some praised its effectiveness for inspiring audiences even in smaller formats, others found its panoramas to be boring, similar to other IMAX films that are said to overexploit immersion as a gimmick. With familiarity to the later catalog of \"more intrepid\" IMAX films, the \"St. Petersburg Times\" found \"To Fly!\"'s impressiveness debatable for many modern first-time viewers. Because of this, the newspaper graded it C in a 1998 review. Meanwhile, documentarian Ross Anthony graded it B+, or two and a half stars out of four, noting that he would have graded it A in the 1970s, and deemed \"To Fly!\" \"amusing and informative (on a basic level)\".\nAudience response.\nThe Smithsonian reported a diverse demographic of audiences, who were reportedly \"astonished\" by \"To Fly!\"'s IMAX vertiginous shots. Shouts and gasps were heard in screenings, especially during the opening sequence\u2014where people exclaimed in awe\u2014as well as at the Blue Angels and hang-gliding scenes. Others, however, screamed in fright and \"hastily\" left the theater during its vertiginous scenes; journalist Douglas Preston attributed this to nausea. For some, uncontrollable dizziness lingered long after the film had finished, equated by \"Time\" magazine with airsickness. Vomit bags were unavailable, making the film inaccessible for people with vertigo. Later, the NASM added pre-entry warnings about potential dizziness and motion sickness. On the contrary, some people noted they were able to watch \"To Fly!\" without getting scared due to it being illusionary.\nMany who watched the film returned with their children to rewatch it, akin to a generational tradition. Similar remarks were made by Carl Sagan, who remained astonished after seeing it more than five times at the NASM. Several pilots credited the film for propelling their interest in aviation, including astronaut Terry W. Virts to whom \"To Fly!\" is his first, and among his most memorable, childhood IMAX films. Dan Moran of the \"Chicago Tribune\" said it is among the few films that kept Pictorium audiences awake instead of asleep. The 2011 Virginia earthquake coincided with \"To Fly!\"'s Horseshoe Falls scene at Lockheed Martin; projectionist Keith Madden and audiences assumed the shaking they felt came from the theater's subwoofers rather than an earthquake. Modern expert hang-gliders were surprised at the hang-gliding stunt by Wills, described as dynamic yet on an \"impossibly simple craft\".\nResponding to the film's popularity, Bill McCabe of the DuPont Aerospace Enterprise said that because humans have a supposedly innate interest in flying, the film has a universal appeal. Several educators categorized it as educational entertainment, though with less interest among field trip groups than other IMAX documentaries. The audience response prompted the Smithsonian to write a tagline on their website: \"\"Feel\" the Earth Drop Away Beneath You\". \"Feel\" was later changed to \"Watch\". In 2013 to commemorate its 37th anniversary, a new poster artwork was created with the tagline \"Go where dreams have wings\", and in 2016, a 40th-anniversary one-minute trailer was released. MacGillivray opined that the film's \"unpretentiousness and lightheartedness\" makes it a form of escapism and its unconventional ending makes it \"more profound and in a way, more lasting\".\nAccolades.\nBy 1992, \"To Fly!\" had received 11 awards.\nLegacy.\n\"To Fly!\" is regarded as an influential IMAX film, with filmmaker and author Lenny Lipton calling it the giant-screen film industry's \"signature film\". Jon Wilkman, writing for \"Literary Hub\", listed the film in 2020 as one of the \"21 Documentaries That Redefined the Genre\". In 1980, Kernan listed the film as one of the top reasons people visited Washington, D.C., alongside the Washington Monument and J. Edgar Hoover Building. It also has a significant history with political figures, viewed by heads of state from Egypt, Greece, Indonesia, Spain, and the United Kingdom. During his first inauguration in 1981, US President Ronald Reagan handed a copy of it to Soviet General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev, and later showed it to him while in Moscow. When George H. W. Bush met Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir in 1989, they went to the NASM and watched \"To Fly!.\"\nContrary to popular belief, the film is not the first in IMAX, though was instrumental in introducing more people to the format. This was acknowledged by IMAX filmmakers like Kieth Merrill of \"\" (1984), and Ron Fricke who decided to film \"Chronos\" (1985) in IMAX after seeing \"To Fly!\", regretting not shooting his more-popular film \"Koyaanisqatsi\" (1982) with it. Brian J. Terwilliger theatrically premiered his IMAX film \"Living in the Age of Airplanes\" (2015) at Lockheed Martin as a tribute to \"To Fly!\" which he watched as a teenager. Christopher Nolan watched the film at the age of 14 and noticed the audience tilting their heads during the aerial scenes; MacGillivray also consulted him on the IMAX cameras for \"The Dark Knight\" (2008), the first major feature-length film to be shot on IMAX and whose aerial scenes were inspired by \"To Fly!\". After watching the film, scientist Anatoly Sagalevich ideated the underwater IMAX film \"Titanica\" (1992) to filmmaker Stephen Low.\nThe film was also cited as a great influence on the legitimization of IMAX and multi-image scenes in IMAX films, which has been common practice ever since. A reviewer urged major film companies to \"watch out\", predicting \"To Fly!\" would set IMAX as a leading film format over Cinerama and 3D. In 1995, the Library of Congress deemed \"To Fly!\" a pioneer of the format, thus culturally, historically, and aesthetically significant for the National Film Registry, an American film preservation effort, which archived its reduction prints. Voters at the Giant Screen Theater Association included it in the IMAX Hall of Fame on September 24, 2001, a decision praised by IMAX's then-co-chief executive officers Richard Gelfond and Bradley J. Wechsler, stating the film deserves such recognition.\nIn 1980, the NASM requested another IMAX film, prompting Moore to collaborate with MacGillivray on \"Flyers\" (1982), which Conoco funded and became a box-office success too. MFF continued making IMAX documentaries, two of which were nominated for the Academy Award for Best Documentary Short Subject: \"The Living Sea\" (1995), also inducted into the IMAX Hall of Fame; and \"Dolphins\", which was the highest-grossing documentary of 2000. Still active, the company is regarded one of the most influential IMAX figures with over $1\u00a0billion of box-office earnings. In 1996, MacGillivray released \"The Magic of Flight\", a film about the Blue Angels which serves as the spiritual sequel of \"To Fly!\"'s scene featuring the squadron.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is the national language of Vanuatu, and one of the three official languages of the country, the other ones being English and French. Bislama is the first language of many of the \"Urban ni-Vanuatu\" (citizens who live in Port Vila and Luganville) and the second language of much of the rest of the country's residents. The lyrics of \"Yumi, Yumi, Yumi\", the country's national anthem, are composed in Bislama.\nMore than 95% of Bislama words are of English origin, whilst the remainder comprises a few dozen words from French as well as some specific vocabulary inherited from various languages of Vanuatu\u2014although these are essentially limited to flora and fauna terminology. While the influence of these vernacular languages is low on the vocabulary side, it is very high in the morphosyntax. As such, Bislama can be described simply as a language with an English vocabulary and an Oceanic grammar and phonology. \nScholars highlight the role of Bislama in undermining the vitality of Vanuatu's indigenous languages.\nHistory.\nDuring the period of \"blackbirding\" in the 1870s and 1880s, hundreds of thousands of Pacific islanders (many of them from the New Hebrides \u2013 now the Vanuatu archipelago) were taken as indentured labourers, often kidnapped, and forced to work on plantations, mainly in Queensland, Australia, and Fiji. With several languages being spoken in these plantations a localised pidgin was formed, combining English vocabulary with grammatical structures typical of languages in the region. This early plantation pidgin is the origin not only of Bislama, but also of Tok Pisin in Papua New Guinea, and Pijin of the Solomon Islands; though not of Torres Strait Creole in the north of Australia.\nThis creole started spreading throughout the Vanuatu archipelago at the turn of the 20th century, as former blackbirds and their descendants began to return to their native islands. Knowledge of this creole would facilitate communication not only with European traders and settlers, but also between native populations, and because Vanuatu is the most language-dense country in the world (one count puts it at 113 languages for a population of 225,000), Bislama usefully serves as a lingua franca for communication between ni-Vanuatu, as well as with and between foreigners. Although it has been primarily a spoken-only language for most of its history, the first dictionary of Bislama was published in 1977. A new dictionary was published in 1995. This, along with its second edition in 2004, has helped to create a standardised and uniform spelling of written Bislama.\nBesides Bislama, most ni-Vanuatu also know their local language, the local language of their father and/or mother, as well as their spouse, oftentimes. The country's official languages of tuition in schools and educational institutions are English and French.\nName.\nThe name of Bislama (also referred to, especially in French, as \"Bichelamar\") comes via the early 19th century word \"Beach-la-Mar\" from pseudo-French \"biche de mer\" or \"b\u00eache de mer\", sea cucumber, which itself comes from an alteration of the Portuguese \"sea animal\". In the early 1840s, sea cucumbers were also harvested and dried at the same time that sandalwood was gathered. The names \"biche-la-mar\" and \"Sandalwood English\" came to be associated with the kind of pidgin that came to be used by the local laborers between themselves, as well as their English-speaking overseers.\nRobert Louis Stevenson wrote in an account of his travels through the Pacific in 1888 and 1889, \"the natives themselves have often scraped up a little English\u00a0... or an efficient pidgin, what is called to the westward \"Beach-la-Mar\".\" In Jack London's story \"Yah! Yah! Yah!\", one of his \"South Sea Tales\", there is repeated a reference to \"a bastard lingo called \"bech-de-mer\"\", and much of the story's dialogue is conducted in it.\nToday, the word \"bislama\" itself is seldom used by younger speakers of Bislama to refer to sea cucumbers, as a new re-borrowing from pseudo-French \"b\u00eache de mer\", which has taken the form \"besdemea\", has become more popular.\nDialectal variations.\nDialects exist, based mainly on different pronunciations in different areas which stem from the different sounds of the native languages. The future tense marker can be heard to be said as: Bambae, Mbae, Nambae, or Bae. There are also preferences for using Bislama or native words that vary from place to place, and most people insert English, French, or local language words to fill out Bislama. So in the capital city it is common to hear 'computer'; in other places one might hear 'ordinateur'.\nOrthography.\nThe Bislama Latin alphabet uses the letters \"A, B, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, R, S, T, U, V, W, Y\" and the digraphs \"AE\", \"AO\" and \"NG\".\nAn older Latin orthography, used before 1995, had \"\u00c9\" (now written \"E\"), \"AI\" and \"AU\" (now \"AE\" and \"AO\"). For those vowels in hiatus, \"A\u00cf\" and \"A\u00dc\" were used (now written \"AI\" and \"AU\"). Labialized consonants (used in loanwords), now written with a tilde (\"M\u0303\" and \"P\u0303\") or a following \"W\" (\"MW\" and \"PW\"), were then spelled with a macron, following the conventions used for some vernacular Vanuatu languages: \"M\u0304\" was used for and \"P\u0304\" for .\nOn the island of Pentecost, the avoiuli script is sometimes used for Bislama. The shapes of the letters derive from sand-drawing. It has distinct letters for \"NG\" and \"NGG\", but otherwise corresponds closely to the Latin alphabet above, though capitals are seldom used, punctuation differs, there are digits for higher numbers and logograms for commonly traded commodities such as pig tusks.\nGrammar.\nTwo frequent words in Bislama are \"long\" and \"blong\", which take the place of many prepositions in English or French.\n\"Long\".\n\"Long\" holds many other related meanings, and is sometimes used in improvisation.\n\"Blong\".\nOriginally from the English word \"belong\", \"blong\" takes the place of 'of' or the genitive case in other languages. Just like \"of\" in English, it is one of the most widely used and versatile words in the language, and can indicate possession, country of origin, defining characteristics, intention, and others.\nVerbs.\nVerbs in Bislama usually consist of a stem word (borrowed from English, French or indigenous languages); most transitive verbs add to this a transitive suffix.\nThe form of that suffix is /-em/, /-im/, or /-um/, depending on vowel harmony. If the last vowel of the verb's stem is either -u- or -i-, then that vowel will normally be copied into the transitive suffix \u2013 however, there are rare exceptions. For all other stem vowels, the transitive suffix has its default form /-em/:\nExceptions exist, such as \"lukim\" (\"look\").\nExamples of transitive verbs which exceptionally \"don't\" take this suffix include: \"kakae\" 'eat, bite'; \"trink\" 'drink'; \"save\" 'know'; \"se\" 'say'.\nVerbs do not conjugate. The tense, aspect and mood of a sentence are indicated with markers such as \"stap\", \"bin\" and \"bae\" that are placed in the sentence.\nNouns.\nThe plural is formed by putting \"ol\" before the word. For example, \"bia\" 'beer'; \"ol bia\" = \"beers\". \"Ol\" comes from the English \"all\". When used with numbers, the singular form is used. 2 bia, 3 bia, etc.\nPronouns.\nThe personal pronouns of Bislama closely resemble those of Tok Pisin. They feature four grammatical numbers (singular, dual, trial and plural) and also encode the clusivity distinction: 1st person non-singular pronouns (equivalent of English \"we\") are described as \"inclusive\" if they include the addressee (i.e. {you + I}, {you + I + others}), but \"exclusive\" otherwise (i.e. {I + other people}). Bislama pronouns do not decline.\nThe third person singular \"hem\", also written \"em\" lacks gender distinction, so it can mean either he, she or it. The predicate marker i \u2013 a particle which is placed before the verbal phrase of a sentence \u2013 is sometimes merged with the third person pronoun, giving the words hemi and emi, respectively, in singular, and oli in plural.\n;hemi stap kukum kumala: he/she is cooking sweet potatoes\nTense/aspect/mood markers.\nSome of these markers also have lexical meanings. For example, \"save\" can mean \"be able to\" but it is also a verb \"know\".\nSample texts and media.\nThe Bible.\nThe longest written work in Bislama is the Bible completed in 1998.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "76393", "revid": "24565488", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=76393", "title": "Participatory economics", "text": "Type of economic system\nParticipatory economics, often abbreviated parecon, is an economic system based on participatory decision making as the primary economic mechanism for allocation in society. In the system, the say in decision-making is proportional to the impact on a person or group of people. Participatory economics is a form of a socialist decentralized planned economy involving the collective ownership of the means of production. It is a proposed alternative to contemporary capitalism and centralized planning. This economic model is primarily associated with political theorist Michael Albert and economist Robin Hahnel, who describes participatory economics as an anarchist economic vision.\nThe underlying values that parecon seeks to implement are: equity, solidarity, diversity, workers' self-management, efficiency (defined as accomplishing goals without wasting valued assets), and sustainability. The institutions of parecon include workers' and consumers' councils utilising self-managerial methods for decision-making, balanced job complexes, remuneration based on individual effort, and wide decentralized planning. In parecon, self-management constitutes a replacement for the mainstream conception of economic freedom, which Albert and Hahnel argue by its very vagueness has allowed it to be abused by capitalist ideologues.\nAlbert and Hahnel claim that participatory economics has been practiced to varying degrees during the Russian Revolution of 1917, Spanish Revolution of 1936, and occasionally in South America.\nWork and distribution.\nBalanced job complexes.\nA balanced job complex is a collection of tasks within a given workplace that is balanced for its equity and empowerment implications against all other job complexes in that workplace.\nCompensation for effort and sacrifice (principle for distribution).\nAlbert and Hahnel argue that it is inequitable and ineffective to compensate people on the basis of luck (e.g. skills or talents that owe to their birth or heredity), or by virtue of workers' productivity (as measured by the \"value\" of the goods they produce). Therefore, the primary principle of participatory economics is to reward workers for their effort and sacrifice. Additionally, participatory economics would provide exemptions from the compensation for effort principle.\nThe starting point for the income of all workers in a participatory economy is an equal share of the social product. From this point, incomes for personal expenditures and consumption rights for public goods can be expected to diverge by small degrees, reflecting the choices that individuals make in between work and leisure time, and the level of danger and difficulty of a job as judged by their immediate workplace peers.\nAllocation of resource.\nAlbert and Hahnel argue that decentralized planning can achieve Pareto optimum, and does so under less restrictive assumptions than free market models (see: the first fundamental theorem of welfare economics). Their model incorporates both public goods and externalities, whereas markets do not achieve Pareto optimality when including these conditions.\nFacilitation boards.\nIn a proposed participatory economy, key information relevant to converging on an economic plan would be made available by Iteration Facilitation Boards (IFBs), which, based on proposals from worker/consumer councils and economic data, present indicative prices and economic projections at each round of the planning process.\nThe IFB has no decision-making authority. In theory, the IFB's activity can consist mainly of computers performing the (agreed upon) algorithms for adjusting prices and forecasts, with little human involvement.\nMotivations (opposition to central planning and capitalism).\nRobin Hahnel has argued that \"participatory planning is not central planning\", stating \"The procedures are completely different and the incentives are completely different. And one of the important ways in which it is different from central planning is that it is incentive compatible, that is, actors have an incentive to report truthfully rather than an incentive to misrepresent their capabilities or preferences.\" Unlike historical examples of central planning, the parecon proposal advocates the use and adjustment of price information reflecting marginal social opportunity costs and benefits as integral elements of the planning process. Hahnel has argued emphatically against Milton Friedman's a priori tendency to deny the possibility of alternatives:\nFriedman assumes away the best solution for coordinating economic activities. He simply asserts \"there are only two ways of coordinating the economic activities of millions\u2014central direction involving the use of coercion\u2014and voluntary cooperation, the technique of the marketplace.\" [...] a participatory economy can permit all to partake in economic decision making in proportion to the degree they are affected by outcomes. Since a participatory system uses a system of participatory planning instead of markets to coordinate economic activities, Friedman would have us believe that participatory planning must fall into the category of \"central direction involving the use of coercion.\"\nAlbert and Hahnel have voiced detailed critiques of centrally-planned economies in theory and practice, but are also highly-critical of capitalism. Hahnel claims \"the truth is capitalism aggravates prejudice, is the most inequitable economy ever devised, is grossly inefficient\u2014even if highly energetic\u2014and is incompatible with both economic and political democracy. In the present era of free-market triumphalism it is useful to organize a sober evaluation of capitalism responding to Friedman's claims one by one.\"\nCritique of markets.\nMainstream economists largely acknowledge the problem of externalities but believe they can be addressed either through Coasian bargaining or the use of Pigovian taxes\u2014corrective taxes on goods that produce negative externalities. \nWhile Hahnel (and Albert) favour the use of Pigovian taxes as solutions to environmental problems within market economies (over alternatives such as the issuance of marketable permits), he is critical about the regressive incidence of such taxes. Firms in a market economy will seek to shift the costs of taxation onto their consumers. While this might be considered a positive development in terms of incentives\u2014since it penalizes consumers for \"dirty\" consumption\u2014it fails to achieve the polluter pays principle and would instead aggravate \"economic injustice.\" Hahnel, therefore, recommends that pollution taxes be linked to cuts in regressive taxes such as social security taxes.\nHahnel is also critical of the mainstream assumption that externalities are anomalous and, on the whole, insignificant to market efficiency; he asserts instead that externalities are prevalent\u2014the rule rather than the exception\u2014and substantial.\nUltimately, Hahnel argues that Pigovian taxes, along with associated corrective measures advanced by market economists, fall far short of adequately or fairly addressing externalities. He argues such methods are incapable of attaining accurate assessments of social costs:\nMarkets corrected by pollution taxes only lead to the efficient amount of pollution and satisfy the polluter pays principle if the taxes are set equal to the magnitude of the damage victims suffer. But because markets are not incentive compatible for polluters and pollution victims, markets provide no reliable way to estimate the magnitudes of efficient taxes for pollutants. Ambiguity over who has the property right, polluters or pollution victims, free rider problems among multiple victims, and the transaction costs of forming and maintaining an effective coalition of pollution victims, each of whom is affected to a small but unequal degree, all combine to render market systems incapable of eliciting accurate information from pollution victims about the damages they suffer, or acting upon that information even if it were known.\nClass and hierarchy.\nAlthough parecon falls under left-wing political tradition, it is designed to avoid the creation of powerful intellectual elites or the rule of a bureaucracy, which is perceived as the major problem of the economies of the communist states of the 20th century. In their book \"Looking Forward\" Albert and Hanhel termed this situation 'coordinatorism'. Parecon advocates recognize that monopolization of empowering labor, in addition to private ownership, can be a source of class division. Thus, a three-class view of the economy (capitalists, coordinators, and workers) is stressed, in contrast to the traditional two-class view of Marxism. The coordinator class, emphasized in parecon, refers to those who have a monopoly on empowering skills and knowledge, and corresponds to the doctors, lawyers, managers, engineers, and other professionals in present economies. Parecon advocates argue that, historically, Marxism ignored the ability of coordinators to become a new ruling class in a post-capitalist society.\nInnovation.\nHahnel has also written a detailed discussion of parecon's desirability compared to capitalism with respect to incentives to innovate. In capitalism, patent laws, intellectual property rights and barriers to market entry are institutional features that reward individual innovators while limiting the use of new technologies. Hahnel notes that, in contrast, \"in a participatory economy all innovations will immediately be made available to all enterprises, so there will never be any loss of static efficiency.\".\nCriticism.\nThe market socialist David Schweickart suggests participatory economics would be undesirable even if it was possible:\nIt is a system obsessed with comparison (Is your job complex more empowering than mine?), with monitoring (You are not working at average intensity, mate\u2014get with the program), with the details of consumption (How many rolls of toilet paper will I need next year? Why are some of my neighbors still using the kind not made of recycled paper?)\nOther criticism raised by Schweickart include:\nTheodore Burczak argues that it would be difficult for others to measure sacrifice in another's labor, which is largely unobservable.\nPlanning.\nParticipatory economics would create a large amount of administrative work for individual workers, who would have to plan their consumption in advance, and a new bureaucratic class. Proponents of parecon argue that capitalist economies are hardly free of bureaucracy or meetings, and a parecon would eliminate banks, advertising, stock market, tax returns and long-term financial planning. Albert and Hahnel claim that it is probable that a similar number of workers will be involved in a parecon bureaucracy as in a capitalist bureaucracy, with much of the voting achieved by computer rather than meeting, and those who are not interested in the collective consumption proposals not required to attend.\nCritics suggest that proposals require consideration of an unfeasibly large set of policy choices, and that lessons from planned societies show that peoples' daily needs cannot be established well in advance simply by asking people what they want. Albert and Hahnel note that markets themselves hardly adjust prices instantaneously, and suggest that in a participatory economy facilitation boards could modify prices on a regular basis. According to Hahnel these act according to democratically decided guidelines, can be composed of members from other regions and are impossible to bribe due to parecon's non-transferable currency. However, Takis Fotopoulos argues that \"no kind of economic organisation based on planning alone, however democratic and decentralized it is, can secure real self-management and freedom of choice.\"\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "76394", "revid": "50686988", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=76394", "title": "Tootsie", "text": "1982 film directed by Sydney Pollack\nTootsie is a 1982 American satirical romantic comedy film directed by Sydney Pollack from a screenplay by Larry Gelbart and Murray Schisgal and a story by Gelbart and Don McGuire. It stars Dustin Hoffman, Jessica Lange, Teri Garr, Dabney Coleman, and Charles Durning. In the film, Michael Dorsey (Hoffman), a talented actor with a reputation for being professionally difficult, runs into romantic trouble after adopting a female persona to land a job.\n\"Tootsie\" was partly inspired from a play written by McGuire in the early 1970s, and was first made into screenplay by Dick Richards, Bob Kaufman, and Robert Evans, in 1979. Richards, who was selected as director, introduced the project to Hoffman, who obtained complete creative control after signing on: revisions to the screenplay and from Richards and his successor, Hal Ashby, being replaced by Pollack caused delays to production, which eventually began in November 1981. Principal photography took place across New York and in New Jersey, with filming locations including Manhattan, Hurley, and Fort Lee. The film's theme song, \"It Might Be You\", performed by Stephen Bishop, peaked at No. 25 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100.\n\"Tootsie\" was theatrically released in the United States on December 17, 1982, by Columbia Pictures. The film grossed $241 million worldwide, becoming the third-highest grossing film of 1982, and received critical acclaim for its humor, Hoffman and Lange's performances, dialogue, and social commentary. It was nominated for ten awards at the 55th Academy Awards, including Best Picture, and won Best Supporting Actress for Lange. In 1998, the film was selected for preservation in the U.S. National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".\nPlot.\nMichael Dorsey is a respected actor, but nobody in New York City wants to hire him because he is a perfectionist and difficult to work with. He makes ends meet by working as a server in a restaurant and teaching acting classes.\nAfter many months without an acting job, Michael hears of an opening on the popular daytime soap opera \"Southwest General\" from his friend and acting student Sandy Lester, who unsuccessfully auditions for the role of hospital administrator Emily Kimberly. In desperation, and following an argument with his agent, Michael disguises himself as a woman named \"Dorothy Michaels\" and auditions for \"Southwest General\" himself, and he is cast as Emily Kimberly. Michael takes the job as a way to raise $8,000 to produce a play by his roommate Jeff Slater, which will star himself and Sandy.\nAs \"Dorothy\", Michael plays Emily Kimberly as a plausible feminist, which surprises the other actors and the crew, who expected \"Dorothy\" to give a mild-mannered performance, in contrast to the empowered \"Gloria Steinem type\" suggested in the script. His character quickly becomes a national sensation.\nWhen Sandy catches Michael in her bedroom half undressed because he wants to try on her clothes for ideas for Dorothy's wardrobe, he covers up by claiming he wants to have sex with her. Sandy is receptive and they sleep together. Exacerbating matters further, Michael is attracted to one of his co-stars, Julie Nichols, a single mother with a daughter from a previous relationship and in an unhealthy relationship with the show's amoral, sexist director, Ron Carlisle.\nAt a party, when Michael (as himself) approaches Julie with a pick-up line to which she had previously told \"Dorothy\" she would be receptive, she throws a drink in his face. Later, as Dorothy, when he makes tentative advances, Julie (having just ended her relationship with Ron per Dorothy's advice) makes it known that she is not a lesbian.\nMeanwhile, Dorothy has her own admirers to contend with: older cast member John Van Horn and Julie's widowed father, Les. Les proposes marriage, insisting that Dorothy think about it before answering. When Michael returns home, he finds John, who almost forces himself on Dorothy until Jeff walks in on them. A few minutes later, Sandy arrives, asking why he has not answered her calls. Michael admits he is in love with another woman, and Sandy screams and breaks up with him.\nThe tipping point comes when, due to Dorothy's popularity, the show's producers want to extend her contract for another year. Michael extricates himself when a technical problem forces the cast to perform live, by improvising a revelation about Emily: that she is actually Edward, Emily's twin brother who took her place to avenge her. This allows everybody a way out, but Julie is so outraged at Michael's deception that she punches him in the stomach once the cameras have stopped rolling and storms off.\nSome weeks later, Michael is moving forward with producing Jeff's play. He returns Les's engagement ring, and Les says, \"The only reason you're still living is because I never kissed you.\" Despite his anger, Les admits that Michael was good company as Dorothy, and Michael buys him a beer.\nMichael later waits for Julie outside the studio. She is reluctant to talk to him, but he tells her that he and her father played pool and had a good time. She finally admits she misses Dorothy. Michael tells her Dorothy is within him and he misses her too. He remarks, \"I was a better man with you as a woman than I ever was with a woman as a man.\" Julie forgives him and they walk away together, engaged in conversation.\nCast.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;* Dustin Hoffman as Michael Dorsey, an out-of-work actor who disguises himself as a woman, \"Dorothy Michaels\"\nProduction.\nIn the 1970s, fashion company executive Charles Evans began filmmaking, following in the path of his brother Robert Evans, a successful actor, producer and studio executive, \"because I enjoy movies very much. I have the time to do it. And I believe if done wisely, it can be a profitable business.\" In the early 1970s, Don McGuire's \"Would I Lie to You?\", a play about an unemployed male actor who cross-dresses in order to find jobs, was shopped around Hollywood for several years until it came to the attention of comedian and actor Buddy Hackett in 1978. Interested in playing the role of the talent agent, Hackett showed Evans the script, and Evans purchased an option on the play. Delays in the film's production forced Evans to renew the option, but in 1979, he cowrote a screenplay based on the play with director Dick Richards and screenwriter Bob Kaufman. A few months into the process, Richards shared the screenplay with Dustin Hoffman, his partner in a company that bought and developed film-development properties. Hoffman wanted complete creative control and Evans agreed to remove himself from screenwriting tasks, instead becoming a producer of the film, which was retitled \"Tootsie.\" Before Hoffman officially became involved, his role had been offered to Peter Sellers and Michael Caine.\nThe film remained in development for another year as producers waited for a revised script. As preproduction began, the project experienced additional delays when Richards left as director over \"creative differences\". He instead became one of the film's producers, and Hal Ashby became the director. Columbia then forced Ashby to quit because of the threat of legal action that would ensue if his postproduction commitments on \"Lookin' to Get Out\" were not fulfilled. Hoffman, in an attempt to get the interest of Sydney Pollack to direct, asked Elaine May to work on the script. She provided a few weeks of work, including adding the roommate character played by Murray, and fleshing out the character played by Garr, as well as being the one to suggest her for the role. May was arguably the most significant of a number of writers who reworked the script (such as Barry Levinson), yet remained uncredited.\n In November 1981, Sydney Pollack agreed to direct and produce the film at Columbia's suggestion.\nHoffman suggested that Pollack play Michael's agent George Fields, a role written for Dabney Coleman. Pollack resisted the idea, but Hoffman eventually convinced him; it was Pollack's first acting work in years. Pollack cast Coleman as the sexist, arrogant soap opera director Ron Carlisle.\nTo prepare for his role, Hoffman watched the 1978 film \"La Cage aux Folles\" several times. He also visited the set of \"General Hospital\" for research and conducted extensive makeup tests. Hoffman has stated that he was shocked to learn that although makeup could be used to allow him to credibly appear as a woman, he would never be a beautiful one. His epiphany occurred when he realized that although he found Dorothy interesting, he would not have spoken to her at a party because she was not beautiful, and because of this, he had missed the opportunity for many conversations with interesting women. He concluded that he had never regarded \"Tootsie\" as a comedy.\nDr. Lillian Glass, voice, speech, and body language expert, taught Dustin Hoffman how to speak like a woman and have the body language movements of a woman. \nScenes set at New York's Russian Tea Room were filmed in the actual restaurant, with additional scenes shot in Central Park and in front of Bloomingdale's. Scenes were also filmed in Hurley, New York and at the National Video Studios in New York. Additional filming took place in Fort Lee, New Jersey.\nReception.\nBox office.\n\"Tootsie\" opened in 943 theaters in the United States and Canada and grossed $5,540,470 during its opening weekend. After 115 days, it surpassed \"Close Encounters of the Third Kind\" as Columbia's greatest domestic hit of all time. Its final international gross in the United States and Canada was $177,200,000, making it the second-highest-grossing movie of 1982 after \"E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial\". Box Office Mojo estimates that the film sold more than 56.9 million tickets in the U.S.\nThe film grossed $63.8 million internationally and was the highest-grossing film in Germany, with a gross of $19 million. Worldwide, it grossed 241 million dollars.\nCritical response.\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, of 53 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 7.8/10. The website's consensus reads: \"\"Tootsie\" doesn't squander its high-concept comedy premise, with fine dialogue and sympathetic treatment of the characters\" Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the a score of 88 out of 100, based on 21 critics, indicating .\nRoger Ebert praised the film, awarding it four out of four stars and observing: \"\"Tootsie\" is the kind of Movie with a capital M that they used to make in the 1940s, when they weren't afraid to mix up absurdity with seriousness, social comment with farce, and a little heartfelt tenderness right in there with the laughs. This movie gets you coming and going...The movie also manages to make some lighthearted but well-aimed observations about sexism. It also pokes satirical fun at soap operas, New York show business agents and the Manhattan social pecking order.\"\nAccolades.\nIn 2011, ABC aired a primetime special, \"Best in Film: The Greatest Movies of Our Time\", that counted down the best movies chosen by fans based on results of a poll conducted by both ABC and \"People Weekly Magazine\". \"Tootsie\" was selected as the No. 5 Best Comedy.\nNational Film Registry \u2014 Inducted in 1998.\nThe film is recognized by American Film Institute in these lists:\nHome media.\nThe film was first released on CED Videodisc in 1983, on VHS and Betamax videocassettes by RCA/Columbia Pictures Home Video in 1985 and on DVD in 2001. These releases were distributed by Columbia TriStar Home Video. The film was also released by the Criterion Collection in a LaserDisc edition in 1992. A special 25th-anniversary edition DVD was released by Sony Pictures in 2008. The film was released on Blu-ray disc in 2013, but only for selected international territories such as Germany and Japan. The film was released on Blu-ray and DVD by the Criterion Collection on December 16, 2014.\nMusical adaptation.\nA stage musical of the film premiered at the Cadillac Palace Theatre in Chicago from September 11 to October 14, 2018, before opening on Broadway in the spring of 2019. The musical has music and lyrics by David Yazbek. Robert Horn wrote the book, Denis Jones choreographed and Scott Ellis directed. Santino Fontana starred as Michael Dorsey.

Tatsuno went through a unique and challenging filming process in order to produce his movie due to lack of freedom within the internment camps that hindered his ability to film his experiences.\nThe film was deemed \"culturally significant\" by the United States Library of Congress in 1996, and was the second amateur film ever selected for the National Film Registry (after the \"Zapruder\" film of the JFK assassination).\nProduction.\nBetween 1943 and 1945, Dave Tatsuno was incarcerated in a Japanese internment camp called Topaz War Relocation Center located in Millard County, Utah. During this time, he filmed his documentary with an 8mm home movie camera that he acquired in 1936. During WWII, cameras were considered contraband for Japanese Americans and were to be surrendered to the government. To avoid this confiscation, Tatsuno gave his camera to his friend claiming \"you can't turn in something you don't have\".\nDuring his time at the camp, Tatsuno began to manage a dry goods co-op. Tatsuno always credited his store supervisor, Walter Honderick, for helping him get the movie camera into the camp. They arranged for the camera to be mailed to the supervisor to avoid inspection, and the supervisor gave Tatsuno the camera warning him, \"I wouldn't get too closed to the [barbed wire] fence.\" Because of his role and previous experience in retail, Tatsuno was selected to do various merchandise runs, which allowed for him to travel outside of the camp and across the country. He estimates that he traveled 20,000 miles during his time doing these runs. It was during this supply trips that Tatsuno was able to purchase 8 mm color film for his camera, which he used to film his experience in the camp. In order to develop the film, he would send it out to Salt Lake City, and from there he would have it sent to his brother, who was attending the University of Utah.\nFilming process.\nDuring his time at the camp, Tatsuno filmed things like his new-born daughter, friends chatting after a church service, his father and son walking through the snow, girls attempting to escape a dust storm, and a teenager skating on a makeshift ice rink. These moments he captured represented the persistence of community through rough conditions. Because of Honderick's warning, the images and shots do not include that of watch towers, guards, and anywhere close to the barbed wire fence surrounding the complex.\nIn 1990, Tatsuno discussed part of his process for making the film by writing, \"When viewing these home-movies, there are several things to keep in mind: 1) These films were taken secretly. Since I was afraid to take many shots in fear of being discovered, you will not see scenes of the guards and sentry at the gate, the barbed wire fences, sentry watchtowers, etc. 2) These films are in color. They tend to make the scene more colorful than the bleak, dusty and arid wasteland it actually was. 3) These are homemovies. As I was merely a hobbyist who enjoyed taking home-movies, these films were taken without the intent of being documentaries. As a result, I focused on family and friends. \u2026The camera shots, thus, do not fathom the emotions hidden within the evacuees - the fear, the loneliness, the despair and the bitterness that we felt.\" While images appear to show the internees happy and enjoying their lives, Tatsuno said that they were \"hamming it up\" for the camera, hiding their sorrow.\nLegacy.\nIn 1996, \"Topaz\" was elected into the National Film Registry that contains films that are to be maintained and preserved in the Library of Congress. There is a version of \"Topaz\" that runs forty-eight minutes long, is in color, and may not feature any of Tatsuno's commentary. There is another version that is open to the public, is in black and white, includes Tatsuno's commentary, and runs for about eighty minutes that can be viewed https://.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

His research on American Sign Language (ASL) revolutionized the understanding of ASL in the United States and sign languages throughout the world. Stokoe's work led to a widespread recognition that sign languages are true languages, exhibiting syntax and morphology, and are not only systems of gesture.\nEarly life and education.\nWilliam C. Stokoe Jr. was born July 21, 1919, in Lancaster, New Hampshire. Stokoe graduated from Cornell University in 1941, from which he earned his Ph.D. in English in 1946, specializing in medieval literature. From there, he became an instructor of English at Wells College.\nCareer.\nFrom 1955 to 1970, he served as a professor and chairman of the English department at Gallaudet University, after being recruited to the position by his friend and former classmate Dean George Detmold. He published \"Sign Language Structure\" (1960) and co-authored along with Dorothy C. Casterline and Carl G. Croneberg, \"A Dictionary of American Sign Language on Linguistic Principles\" (1965). The former was the first place the term \"American sign language\" was ever formally used. (The fully capitalized version: \"American Sign Language,\" first appeared in the \"Buff and Blue\" in October 1963.) He also started the academic journal \"Sign Language Studies\" in 1972, which he edited until 1996. He established Linstok Press, an academic publishing company, to facilitate the journal's publication. Stokoe's final book, \"Language in Hand\", was published in 2001, after his death.\nThough the relationship between Stokoe and Gallaudet was not always one of complete support (Gallaudet closed his Linguistics Research Laboratory, wherein he carried out the studies that would lead him to declare ASL a fully formed and legitimate language, in 1984, after he retired), the university awarded him an honorary doctorate in 1988.\nSign language research.\nStokoe researched American Sign Language (ASL) extensively while he worked at Gallaudet University. He coined the term cherology, the equivalent of phonology for sign language. However, sign language linguists, of which he was the first, now generally use the term \"phonology\" for signed languages.\nNotation system.\nStokoe invented a written notation for sign language (now called Stokoe notation) as ASL had no written form at the time. Unlike SignWriting, which was developed later, it is not pictographic, but drew heavily on the Latin alphabet.\nThus the written form of the sign for 'mother' looks like \n\u00a0\u035c\u00a05x\u00a0\u00a0\nThe '\u00a0\u035c\u00a0' indicates that it is signed at the chin, the '5' that it uses a spread hand (the '5' of ASL), and the 'x' that the thumb \"touches\" the chin. Stokoe coined the terms \"tab\", \"dez\", and \"sig\", meaning sign location, handshape and motion, to indicate different categories of phonemes in ASL. The Stokoe notation system has been used for other sign languages, but is mostly restricted to linguists and academics (as yet, no notation system for a sign language has gained significant use).\nLegacy.\nThrough the publication of his work, he was instrumental in changing the perception of ASL from that of a broken or simplified version of English to that of a complex and thriving natural language in its own right with an independent syntax and grammar as functional and powerful as any found in the oral languages of the world. Gil Eastman, a Deaf actor and playwright, recommended that Stokoe be called the \"Father of Sign Language linguistics.\"\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "76397", "revid": "53396", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=76397", "title": "Little Turtle", "text": "Miami chief (c.1747\u20131812)\nLittle Turtle () (c.1747 \u2014 July 14, 1812) was a Sagamore (chief) of the Miami people, who became one of the most famous Native American military leaders. Historian Wiley Sword calls him \"perhaps the most capable Indian leader then in the Northwest Territory,\" although he later signed several treaties ceding land, which caused him to lose his leader status during the battles which became a prelude to the War of 1812. In the 1790s, Mih\u0161ihkinaahkwa led a confederation of native warriors to several major victories against U.S. forces in the Northwest Indian Wars, sometimes called \"Little Turtle's War\", particularly St. Clair's defeat in 1791, wherein the confederation defeated General Arthur St. Clair, who lost 900 men in the most decisive loss by the U.S. Army against Native American forces.\nName.\nLittle Turtle is an English translation of \"mih\u0161ihkinaahkwa\" , the phonetic spelling of his name in the Miami-Illinois language. His native name in historic records includes many variations, including Michikinikwa, Meshekunnoghquoh, Michikinakoua, Michikiniqua, Me-She-Kin-No-Quah, Meshecunnaquan, and Mischecanocquah. The word names a species of terrapin, probably the Midland painted turtle. There is no diminutive on this name in the original Miami-Illinois language.\nEarly life and physical description.\nThere is little documentary evidence for most of Little Turtle's life. The exact year and place of his birth are uncertain. Still, sources generally indicate that he was born in 1747 or 1752, the years before or following the period that his parents lived in the Miami village of Pickawillany. Some historians give 1752 as his probable date of birth; others prefer 1747.\nThe exact names of Little Turtle's parents have been long debated. Historian Andrew Cayton named Mishikinakwa (The Turtle) as his father and an unnamed Mohican refugee as his mother; however, Little Turtle biographer Harvey Carter indicated that Little Turtle's father was Cinquenackqua.\nLittle Turtle was born in what became present-day Whitley County, Indiana, at either a small Miami village along Devil's Lake or a larger nearby village known as Turtletown (present-day Churubusco, Indiana). Little Turtle lived at Turtletown, along the Eel River, until 1780.\nLittle Turtle has been described as nearly six feet tall. He disdained drunkenness and presented himself as a serious man. Little Turtle was fond of wearing silver on his ears and clothing.\nCareer.\nEarly years.\nLittle Turtle was selected as the war chief of the \"Atchatchakangouen\" division of the Myaamiaki (Miami people) through his demonstration of military prowess in battle. Although he was the war chief of the leading division of the tribe, Little Turtle was never the head chief of the Miami, which was a hereditary position.\nLa Balme's Defeat.\nLittle Turtle earned this designation during the American Revolutionary War in action against a French force allied with the American patriots, led by French military adventurer Augustin de La Balme. After raising a force of forty-to-fifty men at Vincennes, Indiana and a similar number along the Kaskaskia\u2013Cahokia Trail, in October 1780 La Balme plundered Miamitown at Kekionga (present-day Fort Wayne), as part of his campaign to attack the British in Detroit. When La Balme stopped to camp along the Eel River just three miles south of Little Turtle's village, Little Turtle received permission to lead an attack. On November 5, 1780, Little Turtle attacked La Balme, killing La Balme and forty of his men and taking the rest prisoner. The battle was a complete rout, and Little Turtle's army suffered almost no casualties. Many French soldiers were heard begging to surrender while they were scalped alive. Several French officers were taken alive, three of whom were burnt at the stake, one of whom had his hands and feet cut off before being killed by having his face struck with a tomahawk, and four of whom were let go as a warning to the rest of the French. When French forces allied to the Americans attempted to scout out the location a few days later, they saw that the heads of several French soldiers blocked the path impaled on pikes. After seeing this, they turned back. These events occurred in and around what is today Columbia City, Indiana in Whitley County, Indiana. The victory ended the campaign and established Little Turtle's reputation as a war leader. Through the 1780s, Little Turtle continued to lead raids against colonial American settlements in Kentucky, fighting on the side of the British. However, the Miami bands did not uniformly support the British. The Piankashaw Miami supported the rebel Americans, while the Wea Miami vacillated between the British and Americans.\nLittle Turtle's War.\nUnder the terms of the Treaty of Paris (1783), which ended the American Revolutionary War, the British abandoned their native allies and ceded the land between the Appalachian Mountains and the Mississippi River to the U.S. government. (The United States considered this region to be theirs by right of conquest.) Through the Land Ordinance of 1784 and the Northwest Ordinance of 1787, the U.S. government established Northwest Territory in 1787.\nNative Americans living in the territory resisted the encroaching American settlements, and violence escalated in the area. Native tribes formed the Northwestern Confederacy to keep the Ohio River as a boundary between Indian lands and the United States. Little Turtle emerged as one of the war leaders of the Confederacy, which also included the Shawnee under Blue Jacket and the Delaware under Buckongahelas. The war with the United States that followed became known as the Northwest Indian War, also called \"Little Turtle's War\".\nLittle Turtle helped to lead Native Americans against federal forces led by General Josiah Harmar in late 1790. To end the border war with native tribes in the area, the U.S. government sent an expedition of American troops under the command of General Harmar, but his forces lacked sufficient training and were poorly supplied. (Because the United States had mostly disbanded its military after the American Revolution, it had few professional soldiers to send into battle, a weakness that Little Turtle and other native leaders fully exploited.) In October 1790, Little Turtle and Blue Jacket won two victories against Harmar's men. These successes encouraged further resistance. In addition, previously reluctant leaders among the Ottawa and Wyandot joined the confederacy.\nIn August 1791, Little Turtle's daughter was among the women and children who were captured in a raid of a Miami village along the Eel River led by James Wilkinson. By September 1791, a force of 1,400 to nearly 2,000 American soldiers under the command of Arthur St. Clair was moving north from Fort Washington (present-day Cincinnati, Ohio), headed toward the Maumee-Wabash portage.\nSt. Clair's defeat.\nLittle Turtle is generally credited with leading a coalition force of about 1,000 warriors that routed the U.S. forces near the headwaters of the Wabash River on November 4, 1791. The battle remains the U.S. Army's worst defeat by American Indians, with 623 federal soldiers killed and another 258 wounded. The Indian confederacy lost an estimated 100 men. Both Little Turtle and Blue Jacket claimed overall command of the combined native forces in the victory, causing tension within the Confederacy.\nIn November 1792, following the decision of a grand council of tribal leaders at the mouth of the Auglaize River, Little Turtle led a force of 200 Miami and Shawnee past the U.S. outposts of Fort Jefferson and Fort St. Clair, reaching Fort Hamilton on November 3. The warriors intended to attack the U.S. settlements on the anniversary of St. Clair's Defeat. The warriors captured two prisoners and learned that a large convoy of packhorses had left for Fort Jefferson and was due back in the area within days. Little Turtle moved north and found the convoy of nearly 100 horses and 100 Kentucky militia under the command of Major John Adair encamped outside Fort St. Clair. Little Turtle and his warriors attacked at dawn on November 4, just as Adair recalled his sentries. The militia fled into the fort, suffering six killed and four missing, while another five were wounded. Little Turtle's force lost two warriors but captured Adair's camp and its provisions. All the horses were killed, wounded, or driven off; only 23 were later recovered. Adair considered the battle to be a \"triumph\" for Little Turtle; James Wilkinson, at that time a lieutenant colonel in command of the U.S. Army at Fort Washington, believed that the loss of the horses made these advanced forts indefensible.\nBetween 1792 and 1794, General Anthony Wayne commanded the Legion of the United States in a third expedition in the Northwest Territory against the Indian Confederacy. To avoid another defeat, Wayne rigorously trained 3,500 U.S. troops and carefully planned his campaign. The American forces successfully repulsed an exploratory attack on Fort Recovery with an estimated 1,000 warriors in June 1794. Afterwards, Little Turtle counseled his tribesmen to pursue negotiations and peace rather than suffering a defeat in battle, remarking that Wayne was \" the chief that never sleeps.\"\nWhen Little Turtle was unable to persuade the leaders of the tribal Confederacy to negotiate peace, he stepped down as the intertribal war chief. Little Turtle is said to have ceded command to Blue Jacket, although he retained leadership of his group of Miami tribesmen. Little Turtle's son-in-law, William Wells, a white man who was born in Kentucky and lived among the Miami for eight years after his capture in 1784, also sensed the defeat of the Indian alliance and switched his alliance to the Americans. Wells served as a scout for General Wayne's troops and later as an Indian Agent for the U.S. government.\nBattle of Fallen Timbers.\nThe Indian Confederacy, numbering around 1,000 warriors, was defeated at the Battle of Fallen Timbers in August 1794 near the Maumee River. After the battle, the Miamis abandoned Kekionga and relocated to other villages along the Eel, Mississinewa, and Wabash Rivers.\nFollowing the Indian Confederacy's defeat at Fallen Timbers, their leaders signed the Treaty of Greenville (1795), a turning point in their resistance to American expansion. Little Turtle traveled with his wife to Greenville and gave a speech before signing the treaty. He encouraged his people \"to adopt American ways\" and hoped the treaty would improve relations between the Americans and Native Americans. His wife died in camp the next day. Her funeral and burial included American soldiers as pallbearers, American music, and a three-gun salute.\nAlthough Indian resistance to the Americans diminished after the Treaty of Greenville was signed, Indian raids continued to threaten settlements along the frontier until 1815. For the remainder of his life, Little Turtle was a committed peacekeeper, causing some to consider him an \"accommodationist\" who believed that his people would have to adapt to the Americans' way of life if they hoped to endure.\nLater years.\nAfter the defeat of the Western Confederacy at the Battle of Fallen Timbers in 1794 and signing the Treaty of Greenville in 1795, Little Turtle refused an alliance with the Shawnee chief Tecumseh. Little Turtle continued to advocate for peace and accommodation instead of conflicts. He also began to adapt to United States cultural habits, including the acquisition of his land but remained adamant in his opposition to alcohol consumption. Little Turtle made multiple trips east to meet with three U.S. presidents, although he refused to travel with Blue Jacket. He accepted annuity payments, other rewards, and enslaved African Americans in exchange for his cooperation.\nThe United States more highly regarded Little Turtle than Blue Jacket. He was recommended to President George Washington by General James Wilkinson, and in November 1796, Little Turtle met with President George Washington, who presented him with a ceremonial sword. On this trip he also met Comte de Volney. One account of the trip states that on his way to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, to meet the president, Little Turtle met General Tadeusz Ko\u015bciuszko, who presented him with a matching pair of pistols along with instructions to use them on \"the first man who ever comes to subjugate you.\" In 1797\u201398, during a second trip east, Little Turtle met with President John Adams.\nPresident Thomas Jefferson also corresponded with Little Turtle to encourage the introduction of American agriculture to Miami society, although it was Moravian missionaries who demonstrate farming methods to native tribes in the White River area and an East Coast Quaker society from Baltimore, Maryland, who sent Philip Dennis to work with tribes in Fort Wayne to establish a model farm. Little Turtle also made two trips to Washington, D.C., in 1801\u201302 and 1809\u201309 to meet with President Jefferson. At Little Turtle's and other chiefs' request, Jefferson provided agricultural equipment and livestock to the Miamis and Potawatomis to encourage the tribes to adopt farming. Despite these efforts, among others, most of the attempts at assimilation failed, a contributing factor to the federal government seeking further land cession treaties and the eventual removal of the territory's Native American inhabitants from the Northwest Territory.\nA lifelong teetotaler, Little Turtle made a personal plea to President Jefferson to prohibit the sale and consumption of alcohol in Native American communities. On 14 January 1802 he delivered a speech to President Thomas Jefferson and members of the US Senate:\nFather, nothing can be done to advantage unless the Great Council of the Sixteen Fires, now assembled, will prohibit any person from selling spirituous liquors among their red brothers. The introduction of this poison has been prohibited in our camps but not in our towns, where many of our hunters, for this poison, dispose of, not only their furs, etc., but also their blankets and guns, and return to their families destitute...Owing to the introduction of this fatal poison, we have become less numerous and happy.\nJefferson and members of Congress were impressed with Little Turtle's arguments, and on 30 March 1802, Congress passed the revised Indian Nonintercourse Act. This and other federal laws restricting the sale of alcohol to Native Americans remained in effect until 1953.\nIn 1809, Little Turtle suffered a break with other Miami leaders when William Henry Harrison, governor of the Indiana Territory, came to Fort Wayne to renegotiate treaty terms. Working with Little Turtle and his son-in-law, William Wells, Harrison succeeded in obtaining the Treaty of Fort Wayne (1809), which secured of land for the federal government from the Potawatomi representatives and other tribes who cooperated. Other tribal leaders who opposed Little Turtle, including Pacanne, Jean Baptiste Richardville (Pacanne's nephew), Owl, and Metocina, refused to relinquish any more land to the U.S. government. Harrison was forced to recognize the Mississinewa chiefs as the true representatives of the Miamis, not Little Turtle, and to declare that Little Turtle was not a Miami. Although Little Turtle was among the signers of the Treaty of Fort Wayne, afterward, he was \"forcibly retired from Miami affairs.\" Shawnee war chief Tecumseh and his brother, Tenskwatawa (The Prophet), condemned the treaty and began talks with the British about allying. That alliance was attacked by the United States at the 1811 Battle of Tippecanoe, in which William Well's brother fought for the United States while another of Little Turtle's sons-in-law, White Loon, fought for Tecumseh's Confederacy.\nLittle Turtle retired to a Miami village twenty miles northeast of Fort Wayne, Indiana. Following the Siege of Fort Wayne during the War of 1812, General Harrison ordered the destruction of all Miami villages within a two-day march of Fort Wayne, an order that may have been in retaliation for the negotiations in 1809. Harrison's forces also destroyed the village where Little Turtle resided, but spared Little Turtle's home, which the U.S. government had built for his use. The United States defeated the British and their Native American allies at the Battle of the Thames in 1813, destroying the power of the Native American Confederacy. As a result, many Native Americans moved farther west.\nDeath and legacy.\nLittle Turtle died on July 14, 1812, at the home of his son-in-law William Wells, not far from Kekionga. Little Turtle had been suffering from gout and rheumatism for some time. He was honored with a military-style funeral with full military honors at Fort Wayne. Little Turtle was buried in his ancestral burial ground near Spy Run. Wells was killed one month later at the Battle of Fort Dearborn.\nIn 1912, Little Turtle's grave was accidentally disturbed. His remains were disinterred when workers discovered the burial site during a cellar excavation for a home on Lawton Place in Fort Wayne. Although the plans for the house were altered and Little Turtle's remains were reinterred the objects initially placed in his grave- including the sword from President Washington, the pistols from Kosciusko, and other artifacts- were distributed to collectors and later gathered for public display. The objects were placed in the collection of the Allen County-Fort Wayne Historical Society, and were eventually displayed at the Fort Wayne Old City Hall Building.\nLittle Turtle's legacy was one of initial resistance and cooperation to preserve the lives and future of his people.\nHonors and tributes.\nBurial site.\nIn 1959, Fort Wayne residents Mary Catherine Smeltzly and her sister, Eleanor Smeltzly, purchased Little Turtle's burial site to honor his peacemaking efforts by donating the property to the city as a public park. A bronze plaque attached to a granite boulder erected on the site was dedicated in 1960. In 1994, the memorial was improved with additional markers, and a trust was established for its maintenance.\nA small memorial stone placed at Little Turtle's gravesite reads:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;CHIEF LITTLE TURTLE\n1752\u20131812\nME-SHE-KI-NO-QUAH\nCHIEF OF THE MIAMI INDIANS\nTEACHER OF HIS PEOPLE\nFRIEND OF THE UNITED STATES\nHIS ENDEAVORS TOWARD PEACE \nSHOULD SERVE AS AN INSPIRATION \nFOR FUTURE GENERATIONS.\nTHIS PLOT OF GROUND, THE LAST \nRESTING PLACE OF CHIEF LITTLE TURTLE, \nIS DEDICATED TO THE CHILDREN OF AMERICA AND MADE \nA PUBLIC PARK IN 1959\nTHROUGH THE GENEROSITY OF\nELEANOR SMELTZLY AND\nMARY CATHERINE SMELTZLY\nUNDER THE AUSPICES OF THE\nALLEN COUNTY\u2013FORT WAYNE\nHISTORICAL SOCIETY\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It shows female dancers with sharp \"kris\" daggers dancing in trance, eventually stabbing themselves without injury. The film was not released until 1951. It has attracted praise from later anthropologists for its pioneering achievement, and criticism for its focus on the performance, omitting relevant details such as the conversation of the dancers.\nHistory.\nThe anthropologists Margaret Mead and Gregory Bateson visited Bali for two years of research in the 1930s, shooting some 22,000 feet of 16-millimetre film and 25,000 photographs, and completing seven films, of which \"Trance and Dance in Bali\" is one. They were married in 1936. Their output of visual materials has been described as unrivalled in anthropology. This was driven by their method of participant observation, which was intended to be recorded in copious systematic field notes so as to grasp the subject's point of view. They paid careful attention to photographic technique, using both still and motion-picture cameras. During their stay, Bateson sent home for additional bulk film, a larger developing tank, and a rapid winder to allow photographs to be taken \"in very rapid succession\".\nThe dance for \"Trance and Dance in Bali\" was specially arranged during daylight hours, as no lighting equipment was available; the dance was, according to Mead, \"ordinarily performed only late at night\". Mead later noted that \"The man who made the arrangements decided to substitute young beautiful women for the withered old women who performed at night, and we could record how women who had never before been in trance flawlessly replicated the customary behavior they had watched all their lives\". In this way, Mead justified the changes as part of their anthropological inquiry.\nThe film, like Bateson and Mead's other works, initially received a puzzled welcome. The films became classics, launched the field of visual anthropology, and have \"landmark status\" with little to compare them to. Most of the footage of \"Trance and Dance in Bali\" was shot on 16 December 1937 in a performance that they commissioned (on Mead's birthday). They referenced their payment for the performance to Balinese cultural patronage. The trance ritual that they filmed was, according to the anthropologist Ira Jacknis, \"not an ancient form, but had been created during the period of their fieldwork\", as a Balinese group had in 1936 \"combined the Rangda or Witch play (Tjalonarang) with the Barong and kris-dance play, which was then popularized with tourists through the efforts of [the painter] Walter Spies and his friends.\"\nSynopsis.\nThe film describes and illustrates a single performance of the Kris Dance, a ritual dance on the Indonesian island of Bali. The dance portrays the struggle of good, in the shape of dragons, against evil, in the shape of masked \"Tjalonarang\" witches. The dancers are young women. They hold \"kris\" daggers. They are seen to enter trance, one at a time, and are revived from it. While in trance, they dance ecstatically and stab themselves with their daggers, remaining unharmed. \nThe film opens and closes with displayed blocks of text, summarizing the dance's story.\nNo sounds were recorded at the time of filming. The film's soundtrack consists of narration by Mead, and Balinese music recorded elsewhere, possibly by Bateson and Mead's collaborators, the Canadian musicologist Colin McPhee, and the scholar of Balinese dance Katherane Mershon.\nPublication.\n\"Trance and Dance in Bali\" was filmed in the 1930s, most of it in 1937, and released in 1951. It is written and narrated by Mead, with cinematography by Bateson, and co-directed by Bateson and Mead. The short film is now available for free download.\nHistorical significance.\nIn 1999 the film was deemed \"culturally significant\" by the United States Library of Congress and selected for preservation in the National Film Registry.\nThe film was \"very influential for its time\", according to the anthropologist Jordan Katherine Weynand. She states that it records Balinese people \"dancing while going through violent trances, stabbing themselves with daggers without injury. They are then restored to consciousness with holy water and incense.\"\nThe Indonesian American anthropologist Fatimah Tobing Rony argues that the \"photogenic\" violence and trance are untranslatable: anthropology can look at trance but never really penetrates its mystery. In her view, \"the naughty voices of the girls and the vain chuckles of the old women, transcribed by the secretary, are never heard in the voiceover or soundtrack: the women become undifferentiated exotic trancers. And the spiritual depths of the older women are not considered.\" As for objectivity, Rony remarks that \"The photogenic \"Trance and Dance in Bali\" is representative of a kind of anthropological imperialist blindness, ironic considering that these scientists believed [in] and promoted the idea of their own superior vision\".\nThe anthropologist Hildred Geertz calls the film pioneering, writing that Bateson and Mead are more than pathbreakers: their films \"remain in certain crucial respects exemplary achievements.\" In her view, their films are sophisticated \"even by today's standards in that they use film not as ethnographic illustration but as a powerful tool in systematic cultural research.\" Geertz argues that \"Trance and Dance in Bali\" sets out a hypothesis about the interconnectedness of cultural experiences of childhood, ritual, and folk drama. The film is a \"minute\" sample of Mead's \"incredibly large corpus of visual materials\", now all archived and annotated. Geertz notes, too, that the film is \"a highly dramatic and moving presentation of Balinese culture\" that words alone could not achieve, even if the Witch-and-Dragon ritual dance had to be shot in daylight \"rather than catching it in all its terrifying mystery\" at night.\nThe visual anthropologist Beverly Seckinger notes that the film created a visual record of one performance of the Kris Dance, with the minimum of written and voiced-over narration. She comments that the film was pioneering in focusing on one ritual, rather than attempting to show a whole \"culture\" (her quotation marks) in one film; and in limiting the amount of narration. She quotes Geertz's conclusion that \"the\nfilm remains an evocative and striking presentation of the way in which multiple\nmeanings are condensed within a centrally significant cultural form\". Seckinger remarks that all the same the film is \"a product of its time\", with not attempt to have the participants speak for themselves; she notes that without audio equipment, this would have been difficult. Further, the film treats the dancers as typical of Balinese culture, not as individuals, and there is no Balinese voice or quoted Balinese text. Instead, Mead's narration \"inevitably takes on the character of 'scientific' authority\".\nThe hypnotherapists Jay Haley and Madeleine Richeport-Haley describe the film as \"a masterpiece of historical importance\". They visited Bali around 50 years after Bateson and Mead, met some of the same people, and created a film with the title \"Dance and Trance of Balinese Children\", combining new footage with clips from \"Trance and Dance in Bali\".\nThe scholar of film Trevor Ponech writes that by altering the customary conditions of performance, Bateson and Mead's objectivity is open to question, perhaps influenced by their \"ethically questionable, lifeworld-distorting desires\".\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Based on the 1931 play \"The Honest Finder\" (\"A Becs\u00fcletes Megtal\u00e1l\u00f3\") by Hungarian playwright Alad\u00e1r L\u00e1szl\u00f3, the lead characters are a gentleman thief and a lady pickpocket who join forces to con a beautiful woman who is the owner of a perfume company. In 1991, \"Trouble in Paradise\" was selected for preservation by the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".\nPlot.\nIn Venice, Gaston Monescu, a notorious thief masquerading as a baron, meets Lily, a pickpocket posing as a countess. The two fall in love and decide to team up. They leave Venice for Paris, where Gaston steals a diamond-encrusted purse worth 125,000 francs from widow Madame Mariette Colet, owner of the famous perfume manufacturer Colet and Co. When Mariette offers a large reward for its return, Gaston claims it under the alias Monsieur LaValle.\nWhile claiming the reward, Gaston charms Mariette, and admits to being broke. Mariette hires him as her private secretary. He arranges for Lily to be employed in Mariette's office, and stands up to Mariette's board of directors, led by Monsieur Adolph J. Giron, the chairman, who is openly suspicious of him. Having observed Mariette open her private safe (and memorized the combination), Gaston persuades her that she should keep a large sum there, including half of her next dividend installment. Mariette begins to flirt with Gaston, and he develops feelings for her.\nUnfortunately for the thieves, Mariette has two suitors: the Major and aristocrat Fran\u00e7ois Filiba, who was robbed in Venice by Gaston (posing as a doctor). Fran\u00e7ois spots Gaston at a garden party and, sure they have met him before, asks him if he has ever been in Venice, which Gaston denies. Fearing imminent discovery, Gaston and Lily decide to flee that night with what is in the safe, and not wait for the dividend installment. Mariette is invited to a dinner party thrown by the Major. She cannot decide whether to go or to spend the night in bed with Gaston. She eventually goes, but not before Lily realizes that Gaston has fallen for her rival, and wants to back out of the plan.\nAt the party, the Major tells Fran\u00e7ois that he once mistook Gaston for a doctor, prompting Fran\u00e7ois to recall the Venice incident. Fran\u00e7ois tells Mariette that Gaston is the thief Monescu, but she refuses to believe it is true. Lily robs the safe after confronting her partner. Mariette returns home and suggestively probes Gaston, who tells her that Monsieur Giron has embezzled millions from the company over the years. He then admits to being Monescu and to cleaning out the safe.\nLily confronts Mariette and Gaston, admitting that it was she who stole the money from the safe. She hands over the money but then retrieves it, saying it is the price Mariette must pay for Gaston, and leaves. Gaston goes after Lily, then returns to say goodbye to Mariette. He tells her that as marvelous as their affair would be, it would end with a policeman coming to arrest them both. As he leaves, Gaston reveals that he took Mariette's pearl necklace, describing it as her gift to Lily, and she allows him to take it. In the taxi, facing a chilly Lily, Gaston reaches for his present, only to realize she has lifted it from his pocket. Lily is at first triumphant, then realizes Gaston has lifted the money from her. This echoes their original meeting, when they first became partners in crime, and she embraces him in delight as the cab rolls away.\nCast.\nLuis Alberni, Marion Byron, Louise Carter, Gino Corrado, Leonid Kinskey, Fred Malatesta, Hector Sarno, Rolfe Sedan, and Nella Walker also appear in various uncredited roles.\nProduction.\nWorking titles for \"Trouble in Paradise\" included \"The Honest Finder\", \"Thieves and Lovers\", and \"The Golden Widow\"; the latter was publicly announced to be the intended release title. As with all the Lubitsch-Raphaelson collaborations, Lubitsch contributed to the writing and Raphaelson contributed ideas to the directing. Lubitsch did not receive screen credit for his writing, and Grover Jones, who was credited with the adaptation, did not contribute significantly: although he was in the room, his credit was based on a contractual obligation, and he did little more than tell stories. Further, although supposedly based on L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Alad\u00e1r's 1931 play \"The Honest Finder\", Lubitsch suggested that Raphaelson not read the play, and instead the main character, Herbert Marshall's master thief, was based on the exploits of a real person, George Manolescu, a Romanian con man whose memoir was published in 1905, and became the basis for two silent films.\nMade before effective enforcement of the Production Code, the film is an example of pre-Code cinema containing adult themes and sexual innuendo that was not permitted under the Code. In 1935, when the Production Code was being enforced, the film was not approved for reissue, and it was not seen again until 1968. Paramount was again rejected in 1943, when the studio wanted to make a musical version of the film.\nThe Art Deco sets for \"Trouble in Paradise\" were designed by the head of Paramount's art department, Hans Dreier, and the gowns were designed by Travis Banton.\nReception.\nCritical response.\n\"Trouble in Paradise\" was the film that first had people talking about \"the Lubitsch touch\", and it was, in fact, one of the director's favorites. Critic Dwight Macdonald said of the film that it was \"as close to perfection as anything I have ever seen in the movies.\" \"The New York Times\" named the film as one of the ten best films of 1932. In 1998, Roger Ebert added it to his \"Great Movies\" collection. Wes Anderson and Ralph Fiennes both said the film was an inspiration for \"The Grand Budapest Hotel\" (2014).\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 89% based on 28 reviews, with an average rating of 9.1/10.\nAccolades.\n\"Trouble in Paradise\" was named by the National Board of Review as one of the of 1932.\nPreservation.\nIn 2017, \"Trouble in Paradise\" was preserved and restored by the UCLA Film &amp; Television Archive and The Film Foundation from the 35\u00a0mm nitrate studio print and a 35\u00a0mm acetate dupe negative.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "76400", "revid": "40039522", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=76400", "title": "Hutterites", "text": "Communal ethnoreligious branch of Anabaptists\nHutterites (; ), also called Hutterian Brethren (German: ), are a communal ethnoreligious branch of Anabaptists, who, like the Amish and Mennonites, trace their roots to the Radical Reformation of the early 16th century and have formed intentional communities.\nThe founder of the Hutterites, Jakob Hutter, \"established the Hutterite colonies on the basis of the Schleitheim Confession, a classic Anabaptist statement of faith\" of 1527. He formed the first communes in 1528 in Tyrol (present-day Italy). Since the death of Hutter in 1536, the beliefs of the Hutterites, especially those espousing a community of goods and nonresistance, have resulted in hundreds of years of diaspora in many countries. The Hutterites embarked on a series of migrations through central and eastern Europe. Nearly extinct by the 18th century, they migrated to Russia in 1770 and about a hundred years later to North America. Over the course of 140 years, their population living in communities of goods recovered from about 400 to around 50,000 at present. Today, almost all Hutterites live in Western Canada and the upper Great Plains of the United States and central Washington and northern Oregon states.\nHistory.\nBeginnings.\nThe Anabaptist movement, from which the Hutterites emerged, started in groups that formed after the early Reformation in Switzerland led by Huldrych Zwingli (1484\u20131531). These new groups were part of the Radical Reformation, which departed from the teachings of Zwingli and the Swiss Reformed Church. In Z\u00fcrich on January 21, 1525, Conrad Grebel (c. 1498\u20131526) and J\u00f6rg Blaurock (c. 1491\u20131529) practiced adult baptism to each other and then to others. From Switzerland Anabaptism quickly spread northward and eastward in the timespan of one year. Balthasar Hubmaier (c. 1480\u20131528), a Bavarian from Friedberg, became an Anabaptist in Z\u00fcrich in 1525 but fled to Nikolsburg in Moravia in May 1526. Other early Anabaptists who became important for the emerging Hutterites were Hans Denck (c. 1500\u20131527), Hans Hut (1490\u20131527), Hans Schlaffer (\u2020 1528), Leonhard Schiemer (c. 1500\u20131528), Ambrosius Spittelmayr (1497\u20131528) and Jakob Widemann (\u2020 1536). Most of these early Anabaptists soon became martyrs of their faith.\nTyrol.\nAnabaptism appears to have come to Tyrol through the labors of J\u00f6rg Blaurock. The Gaismair uprising set the stage by producing a hope for social justice in a way that was similar to the German Peasants' War. Michael Gaismair had tried to bring religious, political, and economical reform through a violent peasant uprising, but the movement was squashed. Although little hard evidence exists of a direct connection between Gaismair's uprising and Tyrolian Anabaptism, at least a few of the peasants involved in the uprising later became Anabaptists. While a connection between a violent social revolution and non-resistant Anabaptism may be hard to imagine, the common link was the desire for a radical change in the prevailing social injustices. Disappointed with the failure of armed revolt, Anabaptist ideals of an alternative peaceful, just society probably resonated on the ears of the disappointed peasants.\nBefore Anabaptism proper was introduced to South Tyrol, Protestant ideas had been propagated in the region by men such as Hans Vischer, a former Dominican. Some of those who participated in conventicles where Protestant ideas were presented later became Anabaptists. As well, the population in general seemed to have a favorable attitude towards reform, be it Protestant or Anabaptist. J\u00f6rg Blaurock appears to have preached itinerantly in the Puster Valley region in 1527, which most likely was the first introduction of Anabaptist ideas in the area. Another visit through the area in 1529 reinforced these ideas, but he was captured and burned at the stake in Klausen on September 6, 1529.\nJakob Hutter was one of the early converts in South Tyrol and later became a leader among the Hutterites, who received their name from him. Hutter made several trips between Moravia and Tyrol\u2014most of the Anabaptists in South Tyrol ended up emigrating to Moravia because of the fierce persecution unleashed by Ferdinand I. In November 1535, Hutter was captured near Klausen and taken to Innsbruck, where he was burned at the stake on February 25, 1536. By 1540 Anabaptism in South Tyrol was beginning to die out, largely because of the emigration to Moravia of the converts to escape incessant persecution.\nMoravia and Hungary.\nIn the 16th century, there was a considerable degree of religious tolerance in Moravia because in the 15th century there had been several proto-Protestant movements and upheavals (Czech Brethren, Utraquists, Picards, Minor Unity) in Bohemia and Moravia due to the teachings of Jan Hus (c.\u20091369\u20131415).\nTherefore, Moravia, where Hubmaier had also found refuge, was the land where the persecuted Anabaptist forerunners of the Hutterites fled to, originating mostly from different locations in what is today Southern Germany, Austria and South Tyrol. Under the leadership of Jakob Hutter in the years 1530 to 1535, they developed the communal form of living that distinguishes them from other Anabaptists, such as the Mennonites and the Amish. Hutterite communal living is based on the New Testament books of the Acts of the Apostles (chapters 2 (especially verse 44), 4, and 5) and 2 Corinthians.\nA basic tenet of Hutterite groups has always been nonresistance, i.e., forbidding its members from taking part in military activities, taking orders from military persons, wearing a formal uniform (such as a soldier's or a police officer's) or paying taxes to be spent on war. This has led to expulsion from or persecution in the several lands in which they have lived.\nIn Moravia, the Hutterites flourished for several decades; the period between 1554 and 1565 was called \"good\" and the period between 1565 and 1592 was called \"golden\". During that time the Hutterites expanded to Upper Hungary, present-day Slovakia. In the time until 1622 some 100 settlements, called , developed in Moravia and Kingdom of Hungary, and the number of Hutterites reached twenty to thirty thousand.\nIn 1593 the Long Turkish War, which affected the Hutterites severely, broke out. During this war, in 1605, some 240 Hutterites were abducted by the Ottoman Turkish army and their Tatar allies and sold into Ottoman slavery. It lasted until 1606; however, before the Hutterites could rebuild their resources, the Thirty Years' War (1618\u20131648) broke out. It soon developed into a war about religion when in 1620 the mostly Protestant Bohemia and Moravia were invaded by the Habsburg Emperor Ferdinand II, a Catholic, who annihilated and plundered several Hutterite settlements. In 1621 the Bubonic plague followed the war and killed one third of the remaining Hutterites.\nRenewed persecution followed the Habsburg takeover of the Czech lands in 1620 and in the end annihilated them there as an Anabaptist group. In 1622 the Hutterites were expelled from Moravia and fled to the Hutterite settlements in Hungary, where overcrowding caused severe hardship. Some Moravian Hutterites converted to Catholicism and retained a separate ethnic identity as the Habans (German: ) until the 19th century (by the end of World War II, the Haban group had become essentially extinct).\nTransylvania.\nIn 1621 Gabriel Bethlen, prince of Transylvania and a Calvinist, \"invited\" Hutterites to come to his country. In fact he forced a group of 186 Hutterites to come to Alvinc (today Vin\u021bu de Jos, Romania) in 1622, because he needed craftsmen and agricultural workers to develop his land. In the next two years more Hutterites migrated to Transylvania, in total 690 or 1,089 persons, depending on the sources.\nIn the second half of the 17th century, the Hutterite community was in decline. It had suffered from Ottoman incursions during which the at Alvinc was burned down in 1661. Towards the end of the century, community of goods was abandoned, when exactly is not known. Johannes Waldner assumes in \"Das Klein-Geschichtsbuch der Hutterischen Br\u00fcder\" that this happened in 1693 or 1694.\nIn 1756, a group of Crypto-Protestants from Carinthia who in 1755 were deported to Transylvania by the Habsburg monarchy, met the Hutterian Brethren at Alvinc. These Carinthian Protestants read the \"account of the belief of the Hutterian Brethren\" written by Peter Riedemann, which was given to them by the Brothers, and then decided to join the Hutterites. This latter group revived the Hutterite religion, became dominant among the Hutterites and replaced the Tyrolean dialect of the old Hutterites by their Carinthian one, both being Southern Bavarian dialects. In 1762 community of goods was reestablished in Alvinc.\nWallachia.\nIn 1767 the Hutterites fled from Transylvania first to Kr\u00e4bach, that is Ciorog\u00e2rla in Wallachia, which was at that time some from Bucharest. When the Hutterites left Transylvania, their number was down to 67 people.\nIn Wallachia they encountered much hardship because of lawlessness and the war between Russia and Turkey (1768\u20131774). The Russians took Bucharest on November 17, 1769. The Hutterites then sought the advice of Russian army commander \"S\u00e4metin\" (\u0413\u0435\u043d\u0435\u0440\u0430\u043b-\u043c\u0430\u0439\u043e\u0440 \u0410\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0441\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0440 \u0413\u0430\u0432\u0440\u0438\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447 \u0417\u0430\u043c\u044f\u0442\u0438\u043d, General-Mayor Aleksandr Gavrilovitch Zamyatin) in Bucharest, who proposed that they emigrate to Russia where Count Pyotr Rumyantsev would provide them with land all they need for a new beginning.\nUkraine.\nOn August 1, 1770, after more than three months of traveling, the group of about 60 persons reached their new home, the lands of Count Rumyantsev at Vishenka in Ukraine, which at this time was part of the Russian Empire. In their new home, the Hutterites were joined by a few more Hutterites who could flee from Habsburg lands, as well as a few Mennonites, altogether 55 persons.\nWhen Count Pyotr Rumyantsev died in 1796, his two sons tried to reduce the status of the Hutterites from free peasants () to that of serfs (). The Hutterites appealed to Tsar Paul I, who allowed them to settle on crown land in Radichev, some 12\u00a0km (7 miles) from Vishenka, where they would have the same privileged status as the German Mennonite colonists from Prussia.\nAround the year 1820 there was significant inner tension: a large faction of the brothers wanted to end the community of goods. The community then divided into two groups that lived as separate communities. The faction with individual ownership moved to the Mennonite colony Chortitza for some time, but soon returned. After a fire destroyed most of the buildings at Radichev, the Hutterites gave up their community of goods.\nBecause the lands of the Hutterites at Radichev were not very productive, they petitioned to move to better lands. In 1842 they were allowed to relocate to Molotschna, a Mennonite colony, where they founded the village Hutterthal. When they moved, the total Hutterite population was 384 with 185 males and 199 females.\nIn 1852 a second village was founded, called Johannesruh and, by 1868, three more villages were founded: Hutterdorf (1856), Neu-Huttertal (1856), and Scheromet (1868). In Ukraine, the Hutterites enjoyed relative prosperity. When they lived among German-speaking Mennonites in Molotschna, they adopted the very efficient form of Mennonite agriculture that Johann Cornies had introduced.\nIn 1845, a small group of Hutterites made plans to renew the community of goods, but was told to wait until the government had approved their plans to buy separate land. A group led by the preacher George Waldner made another attempt but this soon failed. In 1859 Michael Waldner was able to reinstate community of goods at one end of Hutterdorf, thus becoming the founder of the Schmiedeleut.\nIn 1860, Darius Walter founded another group with community of goods at the other end of Hutterdorf, thus creating the Dariusleut. Trials to establish a communal living in Johannisruh after 1864 did not succeed. It took until 1877, after the Hutterites had already relocated to South Dakota, before a few families from Johannisruh, led by preacher Jacob Wipf, established a third group with communal living, the Lehrerleut.\nIn 1864, the Primary Schools' Bill made Russian the language of instruction in schools; then in 1871 a law introduced compulsory military service. These led the Mennonites and Hutterites to make plans for emigration.\nUnited States.\nAfter sending scouts to North America in 1873 along with a Mennonite delegation, almost all Hutterites, totaling 1,265 individuals, migrated to the United States between 1874 and 1879 in response to the new Russian military service law. Of these, some 800 identified as (literally, \"owners\") and acquired individual farms according to the Homestead Act of 1862, whereas some 400 identified as (literally, \"community people\") and started three communities with community of goods.\nMost Hutterites are descended from these latter 400. Named for the leader of each group (the Schmiedeleut, Dariusleut and Lehrerleut, being based on the German word for \"people\"), they settled initially in the Dakota Territory. Here, each group reestablished the traditional Hutterite communal lifestyle.\nOver the next decades, the Hutterites who settled on individual farms, the so-called Pr\u00e4rieleut, slowly assimilated first into Mennonite groups and later into the general American population. Until about 1910 there was intermarriage between the Pr\u00e4rieleut and the communally living Hutterites.\nSeveral state laws were enacted seeking to deny Hutterites religious legal status to their communal farms (colonies). Some colonies were disbanded before these decisions were overturned in the Supreme Court. By this time, many Hutterites had already established new colonies in Alberta and Saskatchewan.\nDuring World War I, the pacifist Hutterites suffered persecution in the United States. In the most severe case, four Hutterite men, who were subjected to military draft but refused to comply, were imprisoned and physically abused. Ultimately, two of the four men, the brothers Joseph and Michael Hofer, died at Leavenworth Military Prison after the Armistice had been signed, bringing an end to the war. The Hutterite community said the men died from mistreatment; the U.S. government said the men died of pneumonia.\nCanada.\nThe Hutterites responded to this mistreatment of their conscientious objectors by leaving the United States and moving to the Canadian provinces of Alberta, Manitoba and Saskatchewan. All 18 existing American colonies were abandoned, except the oldest one, Bon Homme, where Hutterites continued to live. Other colonies moved to Canada but did not sell their vacant colonies.\nThe Second World War reduced the public's acceptance of Hutterites. In 1942, the Province of Alberta passed the \"Communal Properties Act\", severely restricting the expansion of the Dariusleut and Lehrerleut colonies. Although disallowed by the federal government in 1943\u00a0\u2013 the last time provincial legislation was so disallowed in Canadian history\u00a0\u2013 and eventually repealed in 1973, the act caused new colonies that were founded to be located in British Columbia and Saskatchewan.\nThe Hutterian Brethren Church was recognized by Parliament in 1951.\nAs of March 2018, approximately 34,000 Hutterites were living in 350 colonies in Canada. This was 75 percent of the Brethren living in North America. About half of them lived in Alberta colonies, with a lesser number in BC and Saskatchewan. During summer 2020, many colonies struggled with outbreaks during the COVID-19 pandemic in Canada because \"Hutterite colony members eat, work, and worship together in community settings and share possessions\", according to one report. The groups were taking steps to minimize the spread of the virus.\nOne news report defined the business operations of colonies as \"industrial grade farms that produce grains, eggs, meat and vegetables, which are sold to large distributors and at local farmer's markets\".\nSection 143 of the \"Income Tax Act\" of Canada, introduced in 2007 and modified in 2014 with section 108(5), contains special rules to accommodate Hutterite colonies. According to a 2018 Senate report, colonies do not file income tax returns as corporations, but as individual members:\nBased on a memorandum of understanding between the Hutterites and the Minister of National Revenue, section 143 creates a fictional trust to which all the property of the Hutterite colony and any associated income belongs. The trust's income may then be allocated to the individual Hutterite members, according to a formula set out in section 143, who can then claim the income on their personal tax returns.\nIn 2018, the Senate of Canada asked the House of Commons to review the legislation, because Hutterites were not being allowed to claim the Working Income Tax Benefit refundable tax credit (WITB), which was available to other farmers in Canada.\nPartial return to the U.S..\nDuring the Great Depression when there was economic pressure on farms, some Schmiedeleut moved back to South Dakota, resettling abandoned property and buying abandoned colonies from the Darius- and the Lehrerleut. After World War II some Darius- and Lehrerleut also went back to the U.S., mainly to Montana.\nTheology.\nContrary to other traditional Anabaptist groups, like the Amish, the Old Order Mennonites and the Old Colony Mennonites, who have almost no written books about Anabaptist theology, the Hutterites possess an account of their beliefs, \"Account of Our Religion, Doctrine and Faith, of the brethren who are called Hutterites\" (original German title ), written by Peter Riedemann in 1540\u20131541. There are also extant theological tracts and letters by Hans Schlaffer, Leonhard Schiemer, and Ambrosius Spittelmaier.\nThe founder of the Hutterite tradition, Jakob Hutter, \"established the Hutterite colonies on the basis of the Schleitheim Confession, a classic Anabaptist statement of faith\". In accordance with this confession of faith, Hutterite theology emphasizes credobaptism, a belief in the Church invisible, Christian pacifism, and the rejection of oaths. The Hutterite Churches also believe in \"a set of community rules for Christian living and the principle of worldly separation\". Former members are shunned and are not to be spoken to.\nSociety.\nHutterite communes, called \"colonies\", are all rural; many depend largely on farming or ranching, depending on their locale, for their income. Colonies in the modern era have been shifting to manufacturing as making a living on farming alone gets more difficult. The colony is virtually self-sufficient as far as labor, constructing its own buildings, doing its own maintenance and repair on equipment, making its own clothes, etc., is concerned. This has changed in recent years, and colonies have started to depend a little more on outside sources for food, clothing and other goods.\nHutterite agriculture today is specialized and more or less industrialized. Hutterite children therefore have no close contact with farm animals any longer and are not protected from asthma through close contact with farm animals, as Amish children are, but are now similar to the general North American population.\nGovernance and leadership.\nHutterite colonies are mostly patriarchal with women participating in roles such as cooking, medical decisions, and selection and purchase of fabric for clothing. Each colony has three high-level leaders. The two top-level leaders are the Minister and the Secretary. A third leader is the Assistant Minister. The Minister also holds the position as president in matters related to the incorporation of the legal business entity associated with each colony. The Secretary is widely referred to as the colony \"Manager\", \"Boss\" or \"Business Boss\" and is responsible for the business operations of the colony, such as bookkeeping, cheque-writing and budget organization. The Assistant Minister helps with church leadership (preaching) responsibilities, but will often also be the \"German Teacher\" for the school-aged children.\nThe Secretary's wife sometimes holds the title of \"Schneider\" (from German \"tailor\") and thus she is in charge of clothes' making and purchasing the colony's fabric requirements for the making of all clothing. The term \"boss\" is used widely in colony language. Aside from the Secretary, who functions as the business boss, there are a number of other significant \"boss\" positions in most colonies. The most significant in the average colony is the \"Farm Boss\". This person is responsible for all aspects of overseeing grain farming operations. This includes crop management, agronomy, crop insurance planning and assigning staff to various farming operations.\nBeyond these top-level leadership positions there will also be the \"Hog Boss\", \"Dairy Boss\", and so on, depending on what agricultural operations exist at the specific colony. In each case these individuals are fully responsible for their own areas of responsibility, and will have other colony residents working in those respective areas.\nThe Minister, Secretary, and all \"boss\" positions are elected positions and many decisions are put to a vote before they are implemented.\nThe voting and decision-making process at most colonies is based upon a two-tiered structure including a council \u2014 usually seven senior males \u2014 and the voting membership, which includes all the married men of the colony. For each \"significant\" decision the council will first vote and, if passed, the decision will be carried to the voting membership. Officials not following the selected decisions can be removed by a similar vote of a colony.\nThere is a wide range of leadership cultures and styles between the three main colony varieties. In some cases very dominant ministers or secretaries may hold greater sway over some colonies than others.\nWomen and children hold no formal voting power over decision-making in a colony, but they often hold influence on decision-making through the informal processes of a colony's social framework.\nOverarching all internal governance processes within a single colony is the broader \"Bishop\" structure of leaders from across a \"branch\" (Lehrer-, Darius- or Schmiedeleut) such that all colonies within each branch are subject to the broader decision-making of that branch's \"Bishop\" council. A minister of a colony who does not ensure his colony follows broader \"Bishop\" council decisions can be removed from his position.\nCommunity ownership.\nHutterites practice a near-total community of goods: all property is owned by the colony, and provisions for individual members and their families come from the common resources. This practice is based largely on Hutterite interpretation of passages in chapters 2, 4, and 5 of Acts, which speak of the believers' \"having all things in common.\" Thus the colony owns and operates its buildings and equipment like a corporation, with all profits reinvested in the community. Housing units are built and assigned to individual families but belong to the colony, and there is very little personal property. There are no paychecks on Hutterite colonies, as members are expected to work for the good of the community. Allowances are given, with the monetary amount varying heavily between colonies. Lunch and dinner meals are taken by the entire colony in a dining or fellowship room. Men and women sit in a segregated fashion. Special occasions sometimes allow entire families to enjoy meals together, but individual housing units do have kitchens which are used for breakfast meals.\nDaughter colonies.\nEach colony may consist of about 10 to 20 families (may not always apply), with a population of around 60 to 250. When the colony's population grows near the upper limit and its leadership determines that branching off is economically and spiritually necessary, they locate, purchase land for and build a \"daughter\" colony.\nThe process by which a colony splits to create a new daughter colony varies across the branches of colonies. In Lehrerleut, this process is quite structured, while in Darius and Schmiedeleut the process can be somewhat less so. In a Lehrerleut colony, the land will be purchased and buildings actually constructed before anyone in the colony knows who will be relocating to the daughter colony location. The final decision as to who leaves and who stays will not be made until everything is ready at the new location.\nDuring the construction process, the colony leadership splits up the colony as evenly as possible, creating two separate groups of families. The two groups are made as equal as possible in size, taking into account the practical limits of family unit sizes in each group. Additionally, the leadership must split the business operations as evenly as possible. This means deciding which colony may take on, for example, either hog farming or dairy. Colony members are given a chance to voice concerns about which group a family is assigned to, but at some point, a final decision is made. This process can be very difficult and stressful for a colony, as many political and family dynamics become topics of discussion, and not everyone will be happy about the process or its results.\nOnce all decisions have been made, the two groups may be identified as \"Group A\" and \"Group B\". The last evening before a new group of people is to leave the \"mother\" colony for the \"daughter\" colony, two pieces of paper, labeled \"Group A\" and \"Group B\", are placed into a hat. The minister will pray, asking for God's choice of the paper drawn from the hat, and will draw one piece of paper. The name drawn will indicate which group is leaving for the daughter colony. Within hours, the daughter colony begins the process of settling at a brand new site.\nThis very structured procedure differs dramatically from the one that may be used at some Darius and Schmiedeleut colonies, where the split can sometimes be staggered over time, with only small groups of people moving to the new location at a time.\nAgriculture and manufacturing.\nHutterite colonies often own large tracts of land and, since they function as a collective unit, they can make or afford higher-quality equipment than if they were working alone. Some also run industrial hog, dairy, turkey, chicken and egg production operations. An increasing number of Hutterite colonies are again venturing into the manufacturing sector, a change that is reminiscent of an early period of Hutterite life in Europe. Before the Hutterites emigrated to North America, they relied on manufacturing to sustain their communities. It was only in Russia that the Hutterites learned to farm from the Mennonites. Because of the increasing automation of farming (large equipment, GPS-controlled seeding, spraying, etc.), farming operations have become much more efficient. Many colonies that have gone into manufacturing believe they need to provide their members with a higher level of education.\nA major driving force for Hutterite leadership nowadays is the recognition that land prices have risen dramatically in Alberta and Saskatchewan because of the oil and gas industry, thus creating the need for a greater amount of cash to buy land when the time comes for a colony to split. The splitting process requires the purchase of land and the construction of buildings. This can require funds in the range of C$20 million in 2008 terms: upwards of $10M for land and another $10M for buildings and construction. This massive cash requirement has forced leadership to reevaluate how a colony can produce the necessary funds. New projects have included plastics' manufacturing, metal fabrication, cabinetry and stone or granite forming, to name a few. One unique project came together in South Dakota. A group of 44 colonies joined to create a turkey processing center where their poultry can be processed. The plant hired non-Hutterite staff to process the poultry for market. This plant helped to secure demand for the colonies' poultry.\nUse of technology.\nHutterites do not shun modern technology, but may limit some uses of it. Many attempt to remove themselves from the outside world (television sets \u2013 and in some cases the internet \u2013 are banned), and up until recently, many of the Lehrerleut and Dariusleut (Alberta) colonies still had only one central telephone. The Schmiedeleut, however, made this transition earlier, where each household had a phone along with a central telephone for the colony business operation. In many colonies, telephones are tied into the sort of commercial private branch exchange (PBX) systems more commonly used by businesses, with which toll restriction features could easily be programmed.\nToday, Hutterites widely use telephones for both business and social purposes. Cell phones are also very common among all three groups today. Text messaging has made cell phones particularly useful for Hutterian young people wishing to keep in touch with their peers. Some Hutterite homes have computers and radios; and some (mostly liberal Schmiedeleut colonies) have Internet access. Farming equipment technology generally matches or exceeds that of non-Hutterite farmers. Lehrerleut colonies have recently struggled with the proliferation of computers and have clamped down, so that computers are no longer allowed in households and their use is limited to only business and farming operations, including animal, feed and crop management. As the world evolves more, however, and technology is used more and more for work and communication, many Hutterite young people use computers, photos, and the internet for keeping in contact with their friends and relatives and meeting new people outside the colony.\nEducation.\nHutterite children get their education in a schoolhouse at the colony, according to an educational agreement with the province or state. The school is typically run by a hired \"outside\" teacher who teaches the basics, including English. In some Schmiedeleut schools, teachers are chosen from the colony. The \"German\" education of colony children is the responsibility of the \"Assistant Minister\" at some colonies, but most colonies elect a \"German Teacher\", who in most cases also takes care of the colony garden. His job entails training in German language studies, Bible teaching, and scripture memorization. The German Teacher co-operates with the outside teacher with regard to scheduling and planning. Some Hutterite colonies are allowed to send their children to public school as the parents see fit, but in some cases it is customary to remove them from school entirely in 8th grade or at the age of 15; however, many colonies offer them a full grade 12 diploma and in some cases a university degree. Public school in these instances is seen as a luxury and children are sometimes made to miss days of school in favor of duties at the colony. In a few rare cases, allowing a child to continue attending school past this limit can result in punishment of the parents, including shunning and removal from the church.\nMajor branches.\nThree different branches of Hutterites live in the prairies of North America: the Schmiedeleut, the Dariusleut and the Lehrerleut. Though all three \"leut\" are Hutterites, there are some distinctive differences, including style of dress and organizational structure. However, the original doctrine of all three groups is identical. The differences are mostly traditional and geographic.\nThere are two other related groups. The Arnoldleut\u2014also referred to as the Bruderhof Communities or currently, Church Communities International\u2014is a group of more recent origin which, prior to 1990, were accepted by the Dariusleut and Lehrerleut groups as a part of the Hutterite community. The Schmiedeleut were divided over the issue; one group(Group 1) is called the 'oilers', because of an issue over an oil well and the other group(Group 2) is called the 'Gibbs'. The other is the Prairieleut \u2013 Hutterites that lived in separate households rather than in colonies after settling on the American prairies. At the time of immigration the Prairieleut amounted to around 2/3 of the Hutterite immigrants. Most of the Prairieleut eventually united with the Mennonites.\nSince 1992, the Schmiedeleut, until that point the largest of the three \"leut,\" have been divided into \"Group One\" and \"Group Two\" factions over controversies including the Arnoldleut/Bruderhof issue and the leadership of the Schmiedeleut elder. This highly acrimonious division has cut across family lines and remains a serious matter almost three decades later. Group One colonies generally have relatively more liberal positions on issues including higher education, ecumenical and missions work, musical instruments, media, and technology.\nPhotography.\nAlberta Hutterites initially won the right not to have their photographs taken for their driver's licenses. In May 2007, the Alberta Court of Appeal ruled that the photograph requirement violates their religious rights and that driving was essential to their way of life. The Wilson Colony based its position on the belief that images are prohibited by the Second Commandment. About eighty of the photo-less licenses were in use at the time of the decision. Besides the Alberta Hutterite groups (Darius and Lehrerleut), a handful of colonies in Manitoba (Schmiedeleut) do not wish their members to be photographed for licenses or other identity documents.\nHowever, in July 2009, the Supreme Court of Canada ruled 4\u20133 (in \"Alberta v. Hutterian Brethren of Wilson Colony\") that a Hutterite community must abide by provincial rules that make a digital photo mandatory for all new driver's licenses as a way to prevent identity theft.\nFrom 1972 to 1980, Chicago photographer Mary Koga traveled to rural Alberta to photograph members of the community for her series \"The Hutterites\".\nA 2018 report published by the \"Huffington Post\" contained a series of photographs made by Jill Brody over several years at three colonies in Montana.\nClothing.\nIn contrast to the uniformly plain look of the Amish and Old Order Mennonites, Hutterite clothing can be vividly colored, especially on children, although many Hutterites do wear plain dress. Most of the clothing is homemade within the colony. Shoes were homemade in the past but are now mostly store-bought.\nMen's jackets and pants are usually black. Generally, the men wear buttoned-up shirts with long sleeves and collars, and they may wear undershirts. Men's pants are not held in place by belts, but rather by black suspenders. These pants are also distinctive by their lack of back pockets.\nWomen and girls each wear a dress with a blouse underneath. Most Lehrerleut and Dariusleut also wear a kerchief-style Christian headcovering which is usually black with white polka dots. The Schmiedleut also wear a kerchief-style head cover, but without the dots. The pattern of kerchief thus indicates to which branch the women belong: large dots indicate Lehrerleut, small dots Dariusleut and no dots Schmiedeleut. In some cases Dariusleut kerchiefs also have no dots. Female members of the Bruderhof wear solid colored kerchiefs in black, blue or white and sometimes no kerchief at all.\nYoung girls each wear a bright, colorful cap that fastens under the chin.\nChurch garb is generally dark for both men and women. The clothing worn for church consists of a plain jacket for both genders and a black apron for women. Men's church hats are always dark and usually black.\nDialect.\nJust as the Amish and Old Order Mennonites often use Pennsylvania Dutch, the Hutterites have preserved and use among themselves a distinct dialect of German known as Hutterite German, or Hutterisch, sometimes regarded as being a language in its own right. Originally mainly based on a Tyrolean dialect from the south-central German-speaking Europe from which many of them sprang in the 16th century, Hutterisch has taken on a Carinthian base because of their history: In the years 1760\u20131763, a small group of surviving Hutterites in Transylvania were joined by a larger group of Lutheran forced migrants from Carinthia, the so-called Transylvanian Landler. Eventually, this led to the replacement of the Hutterites' Tyrolean dialect by the Carinthian dialect. The Amish and Hutterite German dialects are not generally mutually intelligible because the dialects originate from regions that are several hundred kilometres (miles) apart. In their religious exercises, Hutterites use a classic Lutheran German.\nIn the courts.\nAs part of their Anabaptist teachings of nonresistance, Hutterites historically have avoided getting involved in litigation within the secular justice system. One of the early founders of the Hutterites, Peter Riedemann, wrote about the Hutterites' stand on going to court in \"Peter Riedemann's Hutterite Confession of Faith\": \"Christ shows that Christians may not go to court when he says, 'If anyone will sue you and take away your coat, let him have your cloak also.' In effect Jesus is saying, 'It is better to let people take everything than to quarrel with them and find yourself in a strange court.' Christ wants us to show that we seek what is heavenly and belongs to us, and not what is temporal or alien to us. Thus, it is evident that a Christian can neither go to court nor be a judge.\"\nConsistent with their beliefs, records do not indicate any litigation initiated by the Hutterites up to the twentieth century. However, in their more recent history in North America some Hutterite conflicts have emerged in court litigations. Several cases involved the Hutterite Colony defending their religious lifestyle against the government. This includes the recent conflict over photographs on driver's licenses in \"Alberta v Hutterian Brethren of Wilson Colony\". Another recent case in the United States, \"Big Sky Colony Inc. v. Montana Department of Labor and Industry\", forced the Hutterites to participate in the workers' compensation system despite the Hutterites' religious objections.\nThe willingness of the colonies to take matters to secular courts has also resulted in internal religious disputes being brought before the court. Two of these cases have come to appeal before the Supreme Court of Canada: \"Hofer v. Hofer\" (1970) and \"Lakeside Colony of Hutterian Brethren v. Hofer\" (1992). \"Hofer v. Hofer\" involved several expelled members of the Interlake Colony in Manitoba who sought a share of the communal property. The Supreme Court of Canada ruled that according to the religious tenets of the Hutterites, the Hutterites have no individual property and therefore the former members cannot be entitled to a share of the Hutterite colony's goods. In the case of \"Lakeside Colony of Hutterian Brethren v. Hofer\", Daniel Hofer Sr. of Lakeside Colony challenged the right of the Hutterian Brethren Church to expel him and other members. The igniting issue focused on who owned the rights to a patented hog feeder. The Board of Managers of the Colony had ruled that Hofer did not own the patent of the hog feeder in question and should stop producing the item. Hofer refused to submit to what he considered was an injustice and also refused to obey the colony's order of expulsion. In response Jacob Kleinsasser of Crystal Spring Colony, elder of the Schmiedleut group of Hutterites, tried to use the state to enforce the expulsion order. Daniel Hofer Sr. initially lost the case. Hofer also lost his first appeal but finally won on an appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada, who overturned the expulsion. The outcome of these two cases has strongly influenced the outcome of similar cases in Canada. When some members of The Nine sued their former colony in Manitoba in 2008 over lost wages and injuries the case was never even heard in court.\nIn the United States judges have repeatedly dismissed cases that were brought against the colony by colony members or former members. Such cases include \"Wollma, et al. v. Poinsett Hutterian Brethren, Inc.\" (1994) in South Dakota, and \"Eli Wollman Sr. et al. v. Ayers Ranch Colony\" (2001) in Montana. More recently in North Dakota, a case was brought by some of The Nine against Forest River Colony and was again dismissed by a judge in March 2010, ruling that the courts did not have subject matter jurisdiction over the case.\nSubgroups.\nIn the last 150 years several subgroups of Hutterites emerged. When the Hutterites migrated to the United States in 1874 and during the following years, there was a division between those who settled in colonies and lived with community of goods, and those who settled on private farms according to the conditions of the Homestead Act of 1862. The homesteaders were called Pr\u00e4rieleut, while the ones who settled on the three communal colonies developed into three branches: Schmiedeleut, Dariusleut and Lehrerleut; in the 1990s the Schmiedeleut split into two subgroups.\nDuring the 20th century three groups joined the Hutterites, two of them only temporarily:\nStarting in 1999, three Hutterite colonies separated from their original \"Leut\" affiliation and became independent. For these three colonies spiritual renewal became a major concern. One of them, Elmendorf, branched out two times, so that there are now five colonies of that kind, which co-operate closely, thus forming a new affiliation of Hutterite Christian Communities.\nPopulation and distribution.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Module:Historical populations/styles.css\"/&gt;\nIn 1995, the total North American Hutterite population was about 30,000.\nApproximately 75% of all Hutterites reside in Canada, with the remaining 25% living in the United States.\nIn 1995 there were a total of 285 Hutterite colonies in Canada (138 in Alberta, 93 colonies in Manitoba and 54 in Saskatchewan). By 2011, there were 345 across the Prairies \u2013 a 21 percent increase. The 2016 census recorded 370 Hutterite colonies in Canada, of these: 175 were in Alberta, 110 in Manitoba and 70 in Saskatchewan.\nThe same 2016 census which recorded 370 colonies, counted a total Hutterite population of 35,010 people (up from 32,500 in 2011).\nAs of March 2018, there were 120 colonies in the United States, of which: 54 colonies in South Dakota, 50 in Montana, nine in Minnesota and seven in North Dakota. A Montana government report in 2010 published a specific list of colonies and schools in that state. Hutterite colonies have existed in the rural farming areas of eastern Washington state since the mid-20th century.\nThe approximate U.S. population of Brethren was 11,000 in 2018.\nIn 2020, the U.S. Religion Census counted 15,531 Hutterites (in 145 congregations), of which: 9,041 of Schmiedeleut group (77 congregations), 4,754 of Lehrerleut (43 congregations), 1,409 of Dariusleut (22 congregations) and 327 in other groups (3 congr.).\nBelow is the list of US counties by Hutterite percentage and population. Data according to \"Association of Religion Data Archives\" (ARDA) in its laterst report.\nColonies.\nThe mid-2004 location and number of the world's 483 Hutterite colonies:\nAs of 2021, there are 572 Hutterite colonies in existence.\nGrowth.\nThe very high birth rate among the Hutterites has decreased dramatically since 1950, as they have dropped from around ten children per family in 1954 to around five in 2010. Hutterite fertility rates remain relatively high compared to the general North American population, but relatively low compared to other traditional Anabaptist groups like the Amish or the Old Order Mennonites. While Hutterite women traditionally married around the ages of 20 or 21, marriages in the 21st century very often are delayed until the late 20s. Whereas Hutterite women traditionally had children until their mid 40s, today most Hutterite women have their last child around the age of 35.\nDepiction in media.\n\"49th Parallel\" (1941) has a segment that takes place at a Hutterite community in Manitoba, Canada.\n\"The Hutterites\" is a documentary filmed by Colin Law in 1964 with the following synopsis: \"The followers of religious leader Jakob Hutter live in farm communities, devoutly holding to the rules their founder laid down four centuries ago. Through the kindness of a Hutterite colony in Alberta, this film, in black and white, was made inside the community and shows all aspects of the Hutterites' daily life.\"\nIn the \"Kung Fu\" episode \"The Hoots\" (December 13, 1973), the sheepherder members of a Hutterite religious sect offer no resistance to persecution by bigoted cattlemen until they learn from Kwai Chang Caine that, like the chameleon, they can change and yet remain the same in the American Southwest.\nIn Season 1, Episode 9 of the TV series \"Movin' On\", \"Hoots\" (November 21, 1974), gypsy truckers Sonny Pruitt (Claude Akins) and Will Chandler (Frank Converse) make a delivery to a Hutterite colony and soon find themselves embroiled in a violent conflict between the pacifists and rival farmers who are angry about the colony outcompeting them.\nIn the 1994 Leonard Nimoy film \"Holy Matrimony\", Havana (Patricia Arquette) is on the run from the law and hides in a Hutterite community in Alberta, Canada, led by Wilhelm (Armin Mueller-Stahl).\nOn May 29, 2012, the first episode of \"American Colony: Meet the Hutterites\" aired on the National Geographic Channel. Filmed primarily at King Ranch Colony near Lewistown, Montana, with Jeff Collins as executive producer, the colony was paid $100,000 for permission to produce a documentary of Hutterite life. Immediately after the first airing, many Hutterites began to complain that the show did not represent a true picture of typical colony life and ended up being a reality show or \"soap opera\" rather than a documentary. Some of the Hutterite cast later said that some of the scenes were scripted and that they were not aware of how the final version would portray the Hutterites. Jeff Collins stated that he believes King Colony members were coerced to write retractions, under threat of excommunication from Hutterite leaders. Colony leaders from King Ranch Colony wrote a letter to the National Geographic Society asking for an apology and that the show be discontinued, citing a false portrayal of Hutterites and a \"breach of contract and defamation of our life and our character\" as the reason.\nIn 2013, \"How to Get to Heaven with the Hutterites\" was broadcast on BBC2 and looked at the lives of the people within the community.\nAnother film about the Hutterites is \"The Valley of All Utopias\" (2012), a documentary about a Hutterite colony in Saskatchewan directed by Thomas Risch.\nHutterites were featured in the CBC TV series \"Heartland\" in Season 8, Episode 7, \"Walk a Mile\" (2014).\n\"Queer Hutterite\" (2016) is a self-produced documentary by a young gay man who left his home in a Manitoba colony to come out of the closet in Calgary.\nHutterites are also often depicted on the satire website The Daily Bonnet, alongside Mennonites, Amish, and other Anabaptist groups.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

His defeatist attitude spreads through the group's senior leadership, including his Air Exec, Lieutenant Colonel Ben Gately. Ordered to fly another mission the next day at a dangerously low altitude, Davenport protests to his friend, Brigadier General Frank Savage, the Assistant Chief of Staff for Operations at VIII Bomber Command. Savage reluctantly shares with Major General Pritchard, the commanding general of VIII Bomber Command, his belief that Davenport has become too emotionally close to his men and may no longer be fit to command. That night, Pritchard and Savage visit the group headquarters to investigate the cause of the mission's heavy losses. When Davenport refuses to discipline failed navigator Lieutenant Zimmerman, Pritchard realizes Savage is right, relieves Davenport of command, and places Savage in command.\nSavage takes a harsh approach to restoring the group's discipline and morale. He reprimands Gately, demotes him to aircraft commander, and insists he fly every mission. Savage assigns Gately the least competent crewmen and orders him to paint the name \"Leper Colony\" on his airplane. Rough-and-ready Major Cobb impresses Savage with his independent spirit and replaces Gately as Air Exec. Savage conducts a series of training missions and waits for an opportunity to restore the group's pride in its abilities. Upset by the contrast of Savage's stern leadership with Davenport's easygoing ways, all of the group's pilots apply for transfer. Savage asks the Group Adjutant, Major Stovall, to delay processing their applications to buy him some time. \nWhen several groups are ordered to abort a combat mission due to heavy weather, Savage ignores the recall order and the 918th is the only group to successfully bomb the target. Savage claims he didn't hear the recall due to a radio malfunction and persuades a furious Pritchard to recommend the group for a Distinguished Unit Citation. Savage also convinces Lieutenant Jesse Bishop, a Medal of Honor recipient, to be Savage's eyes and ears among the combat aircrews.\nWhen the Inspector General arrives to investigate the transfer requests, Savage packs his belongings, expecting to be relieved or court-martialed. But, led by Bishop, the pilots withdraw their requests. Savage softens his attitude towards the men as he becomes more closely involved with them. Gately goes on to win Savage's respect by demonstrating extraordinary leadership and courage in combat.\nWith enemy resistance intensifying as the air war advances deeper into Germany, missions become longer and riskier and many of Savage's best men are shot down or killed. Pritchard tries to get Savage to return to a staff job at VIII Bomber Command, but Savage feels that the 918th is not yet ready to do without him. Reluctantly, Pritchard leaves him in command. Ordered to return to the same target after a particularly brutal raid on a ball bearing factory, Savage finds himself physically unable to haul himself up into his B-17. Gately takes his place as lead pilot and strike commander for the mission. While waiting for the group's return, Savage becomes catatonic. Only as they return to Archbury does he regain his composure and fall asleep.\nThe story then returns to 1949, as Stovall pedals away from Archbury.\nCast.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nHistorical counterparts of characters.\nThe character Brigadier General Frank Savage was a composite of several group commanders, but the primary inspiration was Colonel Frank A. Armstrong, who commanded the 306th Bomb Group on which the 918th was modeled. The name \"Savage\" was inspired by Armstrong's Cherokee heritage. While his work with the 306th, which lasted only six weeks, consisted primarily of rebuilding the chain of command within the group, Armstrong had earlier performed a similar task with the 97th Bomb Group. Many of the training and disciplinary scenes in \"Twelve O'Clock High\" derive from that experience.\nTowards the end of the film, the near-catatonic battle fatigue that General Savage suffered and the harrowing missions that led up to it were inspired by the experiences of Brigadier General Newton Longfellow. The symptoms of the breakdown were not based on any real-life event, but instead were intended to portray the effects of intense stress experienced by many airmen.\nMajor General Pritchard was modeled on the VIII Bomber Command's first commander, Major General Ira C. Eaker.\nColonel Keith Davenport was based on the first commander of the 306th Bomb Group, Colonel Charles B. Overacker, nicknamed \"Chip\". Of all the personalities portrayed in \"Twelve O'Clock High\", that of Colonel Davenport most closely parallels his true-life counterpart. The early scene in which Davenport confronts Savage about a mission order was a close recreation of an actual event, as was his relief.\nMajor (later Lieutenant Colonel) Harvey Stovall, who is a former World War I U.S. Army Air Service pilot who has returned to active duty as a nonflying adjutant, was modeled on William Howard Stovall, a World War I flying ace who returned to active duty as a major in the USAAF the week following Pearl Harbor, and served as the nonflying deputy chief of staff for personnel for the 8th Air Force in England for his World War I comrades, Brigadier General Frank O'Driscoll Hunter and General Carl Spaatz.\nSecond Lieutenant Jesse Bishop (played by Robert Patten), who belly-lands in the B-17 next to the runway at the beginning of the film and was nominated for the Medal of Honor, had his true-life counterpart in Second Lieutenant John C. Morgan. The description of Bishop's fight to control the bomber after his pilot was hit in the head by fragments of a 20\u00a0mm cannon shell is taken almost verbatim from Morgan's Medal of Honor citation. Details may be found in \"The 12 O'Clock High Logbook\". Patten had been a USAAF navigator in World War II, the only member of the cast with aircrew experience.\nSergeant McIllhenny was drawn from a member of the 306th Bomb Group, Sgt Donald Bevan, a qualified gunner who was assigned ground jobs, including part-time driver for the commander of his squadron. Bevan had received publicity as a stowaway gunner (similar to McIllhenny in the film), though in reality, he had been invited to fly missions. Like McIllhenny, he proved to be a \"born gunner\".\nThe \"tough guy\" character Major Joe Cobb was inspired by Colonel Paul Tibbets, who had flown B-17s with Colonel Armstrong. Tibbets was initially approved as the film's technical advisor in February 1949, but was replaced shortly after by Colonel John H. de Russy, a former operations officer for the 305th Bomb Group.\nProduction.\nAccording to their files, 20th Century Fox paid $100,000 outright for the rights to the unfinished book, plus up to $100,000 more in escalator and book-club clauses. Darryl Zanuck was apparently convinced to pay this high price when he heard that William Wyler was interested in purchasing it for Paramount. Even then, Zanuck only went through with the deal in October 1947 when he was certain that the United States Air Force would support the production. The film made use of actual combat footage during the battle scenes, including some shot by the Luftwaffe. A good deal of the production was filmed on Eglin Air Force Base and its associated auxiliary fields near Fort Walton, Florida.\nSource material.\nScreenwriters Bartlett and Lay drew on their own wartime experiences with Eighth Air Force bomber units. At the Eighth Air Force headquarters, Bartlett had worked closely with Colonel Armstrong, who was the primary model for the character General Savage. The film's 918th Bomber Group was modeled primarily on the 306th because that group remained a significant part of the Eighth Air Force throughout the war in Europe.\nCasting.\nClark Gable was interested in the lead role of General Frank Savage. Gable, who had served in the USAAF during World War II, played a similar role in the 1948 film \"Command Decision\". John Wayne was offered the leading role, as well, but turned it down. Burt Lancaster, James Cagney, Dana Andrews, Van Heflin, Edmond O'Brien, Ralph Bellamy, Robert Preston, Robert Young, and Robert Montgomery were also considered for the role. Eventually, the role went to Gregory Peck, who initially turned it down because the script was similar to \"Command Decision\". Peck changed his mind because he was impressed with director Henry King, finding his empathy with the material and the cast and crew appealing. The two made more films together: \"The Gunfighter\" (1950), \"David and Bathsheba\" (1952), \"The Bravados\" (1958), and \"Beloved Infidel\" (1959).\nFilming.\nVeterans of the heavy bomber campaign frequently cite \"Twelve O'Clock High\" as the only Hollywood film that accurately captured their combat experiences. Along with the 1948 film \"Command Decision\", it marked a turning away from the optimistic, morale-boosting style of wartime films and toward a grittier realism that deals more directly with the human costs of war. Both films deal with the realities of daylight precision bombing without fighter escort, the basic USAAF doctrine at the start of World War II (prior to the arrival of long-range Allied fighter aircraft such as the P-51 Mustang). As producers, writers Lay and Bartlett reused major plot elements of \"Twelve O'Clock High\" in later films featuring the U.S. Air Force, the 1950s-era \"Toward the Unknown\" and the early 1960s Cold War-era \"A Gathering of Eagles\".\nPaul Mantz, Hollywood's leading stunt pilot, was paid the then-unprecedented sum of $4,500 in 1948 ($58,000 in 2024) to crash-land a B-17 bomber for one early scene in the film. Frank Tallman, Mantz' partner in Tallmantz Aviation, wrote in his autobiography that while many B-17s had been landed by one pilot, as far as he knew, this flight was the first time that a B-17 ever took off with only one pilot and no other crew; nobody was sure that it could be done. \" The footage was used again in the 1962 film \"The War Lover\".\nLocations for creating the bomber airfield at the fictional RAF Archbury were scouted by director Henry King, flying his own Beech Bonanza some 16,000 miles in February and March 1949. King visited Eglin AFB on March 8, 1949, and found an ideal location for principal photography several miles north of the main base at its Eglin AFB Auxiliary Field No. 3, better known as Duke Field, where the mock installation with 15 buildings (including a World War II control tower) were constructed to simulate RAF Archbury. The film's technical advisor, Colonel John de Russy, was stationed at Maxwell Air Force Base, Alabama, at the time, and suggested Ozark Army Air Field near Daleville, Alabama (now known as Cairns Army Airfield, adjacent to Fort Rucker). King chose Cairns as the location for filming B-17 takeoffs and landings, including the B-17 belly landing sequence, since the light-colored runways at Eglin did not match wartime runways in England, which had been black to make them less visible to enemy aircraft. When the crew arrived at Cairns, it was also considered as \"ideal for shots of Harvey Stovall reminiscing about his World War II service\", since the field was somewhat overgrown. The opening and closing scenes of the derelict RAF Archbury, referencing themes in the film, have a very similar approach to the opening scenes of the derelict fictional RAF Halfpenny Field in the earlier 1945 film \"The Way to the Stars\".\nAdditional background photography was shot at RAF Barford St John, a satellite station of RAF Croughton in Oxfordshire, England. Officially, the airfield is still under Ministry of Defence ownership following its closure in the late 1990s as a communications station linked to the since-closed RAF Upper Heyford. Other locations around Eglin AFB and Fort Walton also served as secondary locations for filming. The crew used 12 B-17s for filming, which were pulled from QB-17 drones used at Eglin and other B-17s from depot locations in Alabama and New Mexico. Since some of the aircraft had been used in the 1946 Bikini atomic experiments and absorbed high levels of radioactivity, they could only be used for shooting for limited periods.\n\"Twelve O'Clock High\" was in production from late April to early July 1949. Although originally planned to be shot in Technicolor, it was instead shot in black and white, allowing the inclusion of actual combat footage by Allied and Luftwaffe cameras.\nReception.\n\"Twelve O'Clock High\" premiered in Los Angeles on December 21, 1949, and opened in New York City on January 26, 1950. It went into general release in February 1950. An influential review by Bosley Crowther of \"The New York Times\" was indicative of many contemporary reviews. He noted that the film focused more on the human element than the aircraft or machinery of war. The \"Times\" picked \"Twelve O'Clock High\" as one of the 10 Best Films of 1949 and, in later years, it rated the film as one of the \"Best 1000\" of all time.\nAfter attending the premiere, the commander of the Strategic Air Command, General Curtis LeMay, told the authors that he \"couldn't find anything wrong with it.\" It was required viewing at all the U.S. service academies, college/university Air Force Reserve Officer Training Corps detachments, Air Force Officer Training Schools, the U.S. Navy's former Aviation Officer Candidate School, and the Coast Guard Officer Candidate School, where it was used as a teaching example for the situational leadership theory, although not currently used by the USAF. The film is also widely used in both the military and civilian worlds to teach the principles of leadership.\nMichael Gebert declares it the best film of 1949. and Christopher Tookey writes, it is \"probably the best picture about the pressures which war imposes on those at the top.\"\nIn its initial release, the film took in $3,225,000 in rentals in the U.S. alone.\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, of 26 critics' reviews are positive. The website's consensus reads: \"\"Twelve O'Clock High\" is a high-stakes, high-tension war drama powered by great, well-written characters.\"\nAwards and honors.\n\"Twelve O'Clock High\" won Academy Awards for Best Actor in a Supporting Role for Dean Jagger and Best Sound Recording. It was nominated for Best Actor in a Leading Role for Gregory Peck and Best Picture. In addition, Peck received the New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Actor, and the film was nominated for Best Picture by the National Board of Review.\nIn 1998, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".\nMeaning of the title.\nThe term \"twelve o'clock high\" refers to the practice of calling out the positions of attacking enemy aircraft by reference to an imaginary clock face, with the bomber at the center. The terms \"high\" (above the bomber), \"level\" (at the same altitude as the bomber) and \"low\" (below the bomber) further refine the location of the enemy. Thus \"twelve o'clock high\" meant the attacker was approaching from directly ahead and above. This location was preferred by German fighter pilots because, until the introduction of the Bendix chin turret in the B-17G model, the nose of the B-17 was the most lightly armed and vulnerable part of the bomber. Enemy fighter aircraft diving from above were also more difficult targets for the B-17 gunners due to their high closing speeds.\nBartlett's wife, actress Ellen Drew, named the story after hearing Bartlett and Lay discuss German fighter tactics, which usually involved head-on attacks from \"twelve o'clock high\".\nRadio and television.\nGregory Peck repeated his role as General Savage on a \"Screen Guild Players\" radio broadcast on September 7, 1950.\n\"Twelve O'Clock High\" later became a television series of the same name that premiered on the ABC network in 1964 and ran for three seasons. Robert Lansing played General Savage. At the end of the first season, Lansing was replaced by Paul Burke, who played Colonel Joseph Anson \"Joe\" Gallagher, a character loosely based on Ben Gately from the novel. Much of the combat footage seen in the film was reused in the television series.\nMany of the television show's ground scenes were filmed at the Chino, California, airport, which had been used for training Army pilots during the war, and where a replica of a control tower, typical of the type seen at an 8th Air Force airfield in England, was built. The airfield itself was used in the immediate postwar period as a dump for soon-to-be-scrapped fighters and bombers, and was used for the penultimate scene in \"The Best Years of Our Lives\" when Dana Andrews relives his wartime experiences and goes on to rebuild his life.\nReferences.\nInformational notes\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "76408", "revid": "31737083", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=76408", "title": "Transverse wave", "text": "Moving wave that has oscillations perpendicular to the direction of the wave\nIn physics, a transverse wave is a wave that oscillates perpendicularly to the direction of the wave's advance. In contrast, a longitudinal wave travels in the direction of its oscillations. All waves move energy from place to place without transporting the matter in the transmission medium if there is one. Electromagnetic waves are transverse without requiring a medium. The designation \u201ctransverse\u201d indicates the direction of the wave is perpendicular to the displacement of the particles of the medium through which it passes, or in the case of EM waves, the oscillation is perpendicular to the direction of the wave.\nA simple example is given by the waves that can be created on a horizontal length of string by anchoring one end and moving the other end up and down. Another example is the waves that are created on the membrane of a drum. The waves propagate in directions that are parallel to the membrane plane, but each point in the membrane itself gets displaced up and down, perpendicular to that plane. Light is another example of a transverse wave, where the oscillations are the electric and magnetic fields, which point at right angles to the ideal light rays that describe the direction of propagation.\nTransverse waves commonly occur in elastic solids due to the shear stress generated; the oscillations in this case are the displacement of the solid particles away from their relaxed position, in directions perpendicular to the propagation of the wave. These displacements correspond to a local shear deformation of the material. Hence a transverse wave of this nature is called a shear wave. Since fluids cannot resist shear forces while at rest, propagation of transverse waves inside the bulk of fluids is not possible. In seismology, shear waves are also called secondary waves or S-waves.\nTransverse waves are contrasted with longitudinal waves, where the oscillations occur in the direction of the wave. The standard example of a longitudinal wave is a sound wave or \"pressure wave\" in gases, liquids, or solids, whose oscillations cause compression and expansion of the material through which the wave is propagating. Pressure waves are called \"primary waves\", or \"P-waves\" in geophysics.\nWater waves involve both longitudinal and transverse motions.\nMathematical formulation.\nMathematically, the simplest kind of transverse wave is a plane linearly polarized sinusoidal one. \"Plane\" here means that the direction of propagation is unchanging and the same over the whole medium; \"linearly polarized\" means that the direction of displacement too is unchanging and the same over the whole medium; and the magnitude of the displacement is a sinusoidal function only of time and of position along the direction of propagation.\nThe motion of such a wave can be expressed mathematically as follows. Let formula_1 be the direction of propagation (a vector with unit length), and formula_2 any reference point in the medium. Let formula_3 be the direction of the oscillations (another unit-length vector perpendicular to \"d\"). The displacement of a particle at any point formula_4 of the medium and any time \"t\" (seconds) will be\nformula_5\nwhere \"A\" is the wave's amplitude or strength, \"T\" is its period, \"v\" is the speed of propagation, and formula_6 is its phase at t = 0 seconds at formula_2. All these parameters are real numbers. The symbol \"\u2022\" denotes the inner product of two vectors.\nBy this equation, the wave travels in the direction formula_1 and the oscillations occur back and forth along the direction formula_3. The wave is said to be linearly polarized in the direction formula_3.\nAn observer that looks at a fixed point formula_4 will see the particle there move in a simple harmonic (sinusoidal) motion with period \"T\" seconds, with maximum particle displacement \"A\" in each sense; that is, with a frequency of \"f\" = 1/\"T\" full oscillation cycles every second. A snapshot of all particles at a fixed time \"t\" will show the same displacement for all particles on each plane perpendicular to formula_1, with the displacements in successive planes forming a sinusoidal pattern, with each full cycle extending along formula_1 by the wavelength \"\u03bb\" = \"v\" \"T\" = \"v\"/\"f\". The whole pattern moves in the direction formula_1with speed \"V\".\nThe same equation describes a plane linearly polarized sinusoidal light wave, except that the \"displacement\" \"S\"(formula_4, \"t\") is the electric field at point formula_4 and time \"t\". (The magnetic field will be described by the same equation, but with a \"displacement\" direction that is perpendicular to both formula_1 and formula_3, and a different amplitude.)\nSuperposition principle.\nIn a homogeneous linear medium, complex oscillations (vibrations in a material or light flows) can be described as the superposition of many simple sinusoidal waves, either transverse or longitudinal.\nThe vibrations of a violin string create standing waves, for example, which can be analyzed as the sum of many transverse waves of different frequencies moving in opposite directions to each other, that displace the string either up or down or left to right. The antinodes of the waves align in a superposition .\nCircular polarization.\nIf the medium is linear and allows multiple independent displacement directions for the same travel direction formula_1, we can choose two mutually perpendicular directions of polarization, and express any wave linearly polarized in any other direction as a linear combination (mixing) of those two waves.\nBy combining two waves with same frequency, velocity, and direction of travel, but with different phases and independent displacement directions, one obtains a circularly or elliptically polarized wave. In such a wave the particles describe circular or elliptical trajectories, instead of moving back and forth.\nIt may help understanding to revisit the thought experiment with a taut string mentioned above. Notice that you can also launch waves on the string by moving your hand to the right and left instead of up and down. This is an important point. There are two independent (orthogonal) directions that the waves can move. (This is true for any two directions at right angles, up and down and right and left are chosen for clarity.) Any waves launched by moving your hand in a straight line are linearly polarized waves.\nBut now imagine moving your hand in a circle. Your motion will launch a spiral wave on the string. You are moving your hand simultaneously both up and down and side to side. The maxima of the side to side motion occur a quarter wavelength (or a quarter of a way around the circle, that is 90 degrees or \u03c0/2 radians) from the maxima of the up and down motion. At any point along the string, the displacement of the string will describe the same circle as your hand, but delayed by the propagation speed of the wave. Notice also that you can choose to move your hand in a clockwise circle or a counter-clockwise circle. These alternate circular motions produce right and left circularly polarized waves.\nTo the extent your circle is imperfect, a regular motion will describe an ellipse, and produce elliptically polarized waves. At the extreme of eccentricity your ellipse will become a straight line, producing linear polarization along the major axis of the ellipse. An elliptical motion can always be decomposed into two orthogonal linear motions of unequal amplitude and 90 degrees out of phase, with circular polarization being the special case where the two linear motions have the same amplitude.\nPower in a transverse wave in string.\nThe kinetic energy of a mass element in a transverse wave is given by:\nformula_20\nIn one wavelength, kinetic energy\nformula_21\nUsing Hooke's law the potential energy in mass element\nformula_22\nAnd the potential energy for one wavelength\nformula_23\nSo, total energy in one wavelength formula_24\nTherefore average power is formula_25\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "76411", "revid": "39627332", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=76411", "title": "Silvio Gesell", "text": "German-Argentine economist (1862\u20131930)\nJohann Silvio Gesell (; 17 March 1862 \u2013 11 March 1930) was a German-Argentine economist, entrepreneur, and social reformer. He was the founder of (German for \"free economy\"), an economic model for market socialism. In 1900, he founded the magazine \"Money and Land Reform\" (), but it soon closed for financial reasons. During his time in Oranienburg, Gesell started the magazine \"Der Physiokrat\" together with George Heinrich Blumenthal. In 1914, it closed due to censorship. In 1916, he published his most famous work, \"The Natural Economic Order\".\nGesell is mainly known for his monetary theory. In particular, he noted the asymmetry between the durability and hoardability of money and the finite shelf life of goods and services which depreciate due to entropy and the passage of time. He believed that people who are able to save or hoard money have an unfair economic advantage over people who are dependent on producing and selling decayable goods and services for their livelihoods. Gesell theorized that the unfair premium enjoyed by hoarders expressed itself in interest rates and spawned recessions, an argument that later influenced John Maynard Keynes's theory of liquidity preference. To resolve this problem, Gesell proposed a new form of money that depreciates over time ().\nGesell also supported free land () and free trade (). However, he disagreed with Henry George's contention that land value taxes could solve the problem of land rent, as Gesell believed that such taxes could be passed onto the tenants. Instead, Gesell proposed nationalizing all land from current landowners, with the purchases financed by land bonds that would be paid over 20 years from revenues raised by leasing the purchased land through competitive bidding. This would achieve many of the intended effects of Georgism, but with compensation for previous landowners, and with no need to repeatedly reappraise land values. Gesell also criticized Henry George for believing that Georgism would eliminate interest, economic crises, and unemployment.\nAt the suggestion of Erich M\u00fcchsam and Gustav Landauer, Gesell served as the finance minister of the Bavarian Soviet Republic for eight days in 1919. After the republic's violent end, Gesell was detained for several months on a charge of treason but was acquitted by a Munich court after he gave a speech in his own defense.\nIn the mid-to-late 1900s, Gesell's ideas were published and discussed only in the limited circle of his supporters. Since the beginning of the 2000s, Gesell has received increasing attention among the general public. The reasons for this include discussions about local currencies and cryptocurrencies, the zero interest-rate policy of some central banks, and the desire of some economists for negative interest rates.\nLife.\nSilvio Jean Gesell was the seventh of nine children of Ernst and Mathilde Gesell. His mother, a Walloon, was a daughter of Nicolas and Jeanette Joseph Talbots. His father, Ernst Gesell, a German, originally from Aachen, was a secretary in Malmedy, now part of Belgium but then ruled by Prussia. Silvio Gesell's birthplace at Rathausstra\u00dfe 81 in St. Vith is decorated with a commemorative plaque. His grandmother Jeanette Talbots, in whose honor Gesell received his middle name, was daughter of the well-known St. Vith builder Josef Lentz. Before her marriage, she worked in Verviers and Andenne as a teacher for Don Carlos, prince of Capua and brother of Francis II of the Two Sicilies.\nAfter attending public school in Sankt Vith, he moved to the Gymnasium in Malmedy. He had to pay for his living expenses from an early age and could not afford higher education, so he decided against attending a university and worked for the German \"Reichspost\", the postal system of the German Empire. However, he was dissatisfied with the job, so he began an apprenticeship to his merchant brothers in Berlin. He then lived in M\u00e1laga, Spain for two years, working as a correspondent. He then returned to Berlin to complete his compulsory military service. Subsequently, he worked as a merchant in Braunschweig and Hamburg.\nIn 1887, Gesell relocated to Buenos Aires, Argentina, where he became self-employed and opened a franchise of his brother's business in Berlin. The 1890 depression in Argentina hurt his business considerably, so he transferred ownership of his Argentinian franchise to his brother in 1890. The ongoing economic crisis caused him to think about the structural problems caused by the monetary system. In 1891, Gesell released his first theoretical writing on currency: https:// (). He also wrote and published \"The Nerve of Things\" (, 1891) and \"The nationalization of money\" (). He returned to Europe in 1892.\nAfter a short stay in Germany, Gesell settled in Les Hauts-Geneveys in the Canton of Neuch\u00e2tel in Switzerland, where he acquired a farm. In addition to working in agriculture, he dedicated himself to studying economics and writing.\nHe completed his self-taught education by reading the works of the most important economists, trying to contrast their monetary theories. Judging by the quotations, he read David Hume, Adam Smith, David Ricardo, Karl Marx, Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, Henry George, Knut Wicksell, Eugen von B\u00f6hm-Bawerk, Carl Menger, Georg Friedrich Knapp, John Law.\nHe also started publishing a magazine, \"The Money and Land Reform\" () in 1900, but it was not a great success. He discontinued it in 1903 for financial reasons.\nFrom 1907 to 1911, Gesell lived in Argentina again. He then returned to Germany where he chose to live in the vegetarian-oriented fruit-growing cooperative called Eden in Oranienburg. There, he founded his magazine \"Der Physiokrat\" together with George Heinrich Blumenthal. In March 1916, further publication was prohibited due to wartime censorship during the World War I.\nGesell left Germany and returned back to his farm in Switzerland. Through his business, he acquired certain assets, with which he was able to dispatch so that crises did not damage him to a large extent. He also received support from his friends, especially from Paul Klemm in Transylvania, Romania, a wealthy wood manufacturer who occasionally paid the printing costs for Gesell's most sold publications.\nIn April 1919, Gesell received a call from Ernst Niekisch from the revolutionary government of Bavarian Soviet Republic to come to Munich. This offered him a seat in the so-called https:// and he was appointed shortly, on suggestion of Erich M\u00fcchsam and Gustav Landauer, as the \"People's Representative for Finance\" () situated in Munich. Gesell worked with law Professor Karl Polenske from the University of Greifswald and the Swiss physician and mathematician Theophil Friedrich Christen. He wrote a law for the creation of Freigeld (Free Money), a currency system he had developed. However, his term lasted for only seven days.\nAfter the violent end of Soviet Republic, Gesell was arrested. There he shared a cell with the poet Gustav Gr\u00e4ser, whose writing on revolution he funded. After several months in prison, he was acquitted on July 1919 in a high treason trial for his self-defense speech in front of a Munich court martial. He claimed that he didn't have anything to do with the political decisions of the Republic and was just trying to offer a plan to restructure the economy. The legal costs of the process were paid by the state treasury. However, he, Gr\u00e4ser, and others was deported from Bavaria. Immediately after his discharge, Gesell and his supporters resumed their activism for his revolutionary ideas.\nGesell spent the last decade of his life promoting his theories.\nDue to of his participation with the Munich Soviet Republic, the Swiss authorities refused to let him return to his farm, as an \"undesirable foreigner\". Gesell subsequently retired to Bergholz-Rehbr\u00fccke, Potsdam-Mittelmark, then back to Oranienburg-Eden once again. In 1924, another stay in Argentina followed. In 1927, he lived in Eden again until he died from pneumonia on 11 March 1930. He was buried in a cemetery in Oranienburg. Bertha Heimberg delivered his funeral speech. Silvio Gesell was married to Anna (born B\u00f6ttger), with whom he had four children. From his relationship with Jenny Bumenthal (born F\u00fchrer), his son Hans-Joachim F\u00fchrer was born in 1915. Gesell had further relationships and children with Wanda Tomys and Grete Siermann.\nEconomic philosophy.\nIn his book \"The Natural Economic Order through Free Land and Free Money\" (), which was self-published, Gesell stated his theories.\nGesell based his economical ideas on the self-interest of people, as a healthy and natural inducement which allows them to provide for their necessities and become economically active.\nHe called for free, fair business competition, with equal chances for all.\nThis included the removal of all legal and inherited privileges.\nGesell believed that an economic system must do justice to individual proclivities.\nSuch circumstances should establish an economical order for itself, otherwise it is set up for failure.\nFor that reason, Gesell referred to his economical model as \"natural\".\nWith such a statement, he consciously held himself in contradiction to Karl Marx, who demanded a change in social relations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"Once again is the marxistic goal to be achieved by force, on the road of law. The nature of people is directed against this goal, arguing it.\"\u2014\u200a\nUnder Freiwirtschaft, the most talented people would have the greatest income, without distortion by risk-free interest and rent-seeking.\nThe economic status of the less-talented would improve because they would not be forced to pay interest and land rent charges.\nAccording to Gesell, this would reduce inequality between the poor and the rich.\nFurthermore, greater per capita incomes would mean that the poor would have a greater chance of escaping poverty, in part because poor people would have greater disposable income and spending power.\nSilvio Gesell advocated a world order and considered himself a world citizen.\nAccording to his belief system, inspired by Henry George, the Earth should belong to all people equally, with no difference in race, sex, status, assets, religion, age, or ability to provide.\nHowever, his land reform proposal was different from Georgism.\nHe believed that land value taxes could not solve the problem of land rent, as he believed that such taxes could be passed onto the tenants.\nHe believed that the private ownership of land should be abolished and replaced by free-land reform, a sort of public lease of land.\nHe proposed nationalizing all land from current landowners, with the purchases financed by land bonds that would be paid over 20 years from revenues raised by leasing the purchased land through competitive bidding.\nThis would achieve many of the intended effects of Georgism, but with compensation for previous landowners, and with no need to repeatedly reappraise land values.\nLandowners would no longer own their land, but they would be compensated through the bond payments and could obtain private possession of their land if they pay the leases.\nGesell also criticized Henry George for supporting the fructification theory of interest and believing that Georgism would be sufficient to eliminate interest, economic crises, and unemployment.\nAccording to Silvio Gesell, establishing welfare states without abolishing private ownership of land would be ineffective, because the proceeds of the worker's labor would be determined by the proceeds of labor that they obtain on the lands of the landowners, rather than free-land.\nPrivate ownership of land converts all the advantages of using one's land into cash and thus belongs to the landowner.\nIn order to not cancel the effects of welfare policies, Silvio Gesell believed that Free-Land reform was necessary.\nSome regard Gesell's idea of Freigeld as a negative interest rate policy, but they have different effects.\nUnder the Freigeld reforms of Gesell, hoarding money becomes impossible because the face-value of money depreciates regularly.\nThis forces the circulation of money.\nBy contrast, it is possible to hoard money on negative interests, since the face-value of money is constant and people can use their money as a means of saving.\nFor example, Japan's negative interest rates drove up the sales of safes and strongboxes.\nGesell denied value theory in economics.\nHe thought that value theory is useless and prevents economics from becoming science, and that a currency administration guided by value theory was doomed to sterility and inactivity.\nReception.\nEarly free-economy organizations.\nIn 1909, George Blumenthal established with the Association for Physiocratic Politics () the first platform for the expansion of Silvio Gesell's teachings. In the following future, a publishing house and a magazine were established in 1913. Inside the movement, one placed in Gang by Bumenthal, contradictory opinions immediately appeared, that led to founding of new organisations. In this respect, there is the Free-Land - Free-Money - Contract (), founded by Paulus Kl\u00fcpfel, and Contract for Free-economy (), founded by Helmut Haacke.\nAccording to G\u00fcnter Bartsch, in the early stages of free-economic organizations, there were \"Two Political Techings\" battling one another, the Anarcho-liberalism and State-socialism. Swiss life reformer Werner Zimmermann found, more successful or not, a synthesis, which he called Free socialism.\nFrom the Soviet Republic in 1919 until Gesell's death.\nErich M\u00fcchsam and Gustav Landauer.\nAmong other things, the fact that Gesell got appointed as the finance minister of the Munich Soviet Republic was based on a joint proposal by Gustav Landauer and Erich M\u00fcchsam.\n\"The practice of his free-money theory accompanied with nationalization of banks\" appeared to them as a particularly effective means of \"making exploitation and usury impossible fast\".\nIn M\u00fcchsam's Personal Account Report on the Revolutionary Events in Munich (), he wrote that Silvio Gesell had the most \"comprehensive knowledge in the field of money\", and his \"recognizable anarchist attitude\" were known to them.\nShortly after Gesell's death, M\u00fcchsam stated in his funeral oration: \"The time of revolutionary realization will have much to give to the dead. The road of mankind toward proper unity will be stamped with the kind of ground as from Silvio Gesell's garden.\"\nLandauer was also impressed very early on by Gesell's free-money theory.\nHe saw in him a disciple of Pierre-Joseph Proudhon.\nIn his \"Call to Socialism\" () published in 1911, he wrote: \"In a free-transactional economy, money must become equal to all other commodities from which it differs in essence today, and yet become a general means of exchange. Very valuable are the proposals that Silvio Gesell has made. [...] He is one of the very few, who have learned from Proudhon, recognized his greatness and, following him, have come to continue thinking independently.\"\nSilvio Gesell and Gottfried Feder.\nThe historian Udo Kissenkoetter made references in the 1920s to the activities of the antisemitic German Socialist Party (DSP), where Gottfried Feder was included as much as Silvio Gesell was, as the main speakers and competitors.\nSupporters of Gesell and Feder inside the DSP ranked with many seats of local government for an economic program, and were in the second congress in August 1920 in Leipzig.\nIn this course, in the \"early-fascistic circles\", Gesell's plans for governing of the conjuncture, and Feder's model of national money creation were seen as a mental common good.\nIn August 1921, a multinational NSDAP-congress in Linz finally decided that Gottfired Feder's economical views would be adopted against Silvio Gesell's teachings.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Some of the basic economic ideas of Freiwirtschaft were also independently published in 1890 by the Hungarian-Austrian economist Theodor Hertzka in his novel \"Freiland \u2013 ein soziales Zukunftsbild\" (\"Freeland \u2013 A Social Anticipation\").\nStructure.\nFreiwirtschaft consists of three central aspects, usually summed up as the Three Fs:\nFreigeld.\nFreigeld is particularly unique to Silvio Gesell's economic proposals.\nFreigeld has several special properties:\nIn theory, since Freigeld would automatically lose its value after some time, there would be no incentive to store or hoard it.\nAs a result, Freigeld would encourage bankers to lend money without charging interest rates, thus leading to an interest-free economy.\nMonetary theory.\nAccording to Gesell, all human-produced goods are subject to expensive storage, whereas money is not: grain loses its weight, metal products rust, housing deteriorates. Therefore, money has a supreme advantage over all other goods. John Maynard Keynes renamed the concept of \"basic interest\" articulated in Gesell's book \"The Natural Economic Order\" with the more familiar term liquidity preference. Being \"liquid\" \u2013 having money \u2013 is a great advantage to anybody, much more so than having comparable amounts (past utility) of any product. The result is that people will not even provide zero-risk, inflation-corrected credits unless a certain interest rate is offered. \"Freigeld\" simply reduces this \"primordial\" interest rate, which is estimated to be somewhere around 3% to 5%, by an absolute, in order to lower the average interest rate to a value around 0.\nFreiwirtschaft claims that current monetary systems are flawed. In mainstream economics, prices convey information. For example, dropping prices on a product mean that there is less demand or more supply of that product. This leads to a buyer's buying more, or a seller's/producer's starting to sell/produce something else, thereby reducing the supply of that product. As a reaction, assuming constant desirability, the price of the product rises again. So, the price, together with the market participants, builds up a feedback loop around a stable, \"ideal\" price. At this stable price, the market is ideal, no one pays too much or earns too little, and there are no tendencies from either party to change that price. The \"wobbling\" around that ideal price is called \"self-stabilizing\".\nThe key error of the current system, according to Gesell, is the ill-transported information in the price. Money is nothing but a claim for goods and services, usable in the economies that accept money in exchange for the former. In a weak economy, money is worth less in goods. But instead of an inflation, the result is a deflation as described above, and less money can now buy the same goods. This feedback loop is \"self-destabilizing\", according to the Freiwirtschaft theory.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "76416", "revid": "1317847517", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=76416", "title": "Maximum power transfer theorem", "text": "Theorem in electrical engineering\nIn electrical engineering, the maximum power transfer theorem states that, to obtain \"maximum\" external power from a power source with internal resistance, the resistance of the load must equal the resistance of the source as viewed from its output terminals. Moritz von Jacobi published the maximum power (transfer) theorem around 1840; it is also referred to as \"Jacobi's law\".\nThe theorem results in maximum \"power\" transfer from the power source to the load, but not maximum \"efficiency\" of useful power out of total power consumed. If the load resistance is made larger than the source resistance, then efficiency increases (since a higher percentage of the source power is transferred to the load), but the \"magnitude\" of the load power decreases (since the total circuit resistance increases). If the load resistance is made smaller than the source resistance, then efficiency decreases (since most of the power ends up being dissipated in the source). Although the total power dissipated increases (due to a lower total resistance), the amount dissipated in the load decreases.\nThe theorem states how to choose (so as to maximize power transfer) the load resistance, once the source resistance is given. It is a common misconception to apply the theorem in the opposite scenario. It does \"not\" say how to choose the source resistance for a given load resistance. In fact, the source resistance that maximizes power transfer from a voltage source is always zero (the hypothetical ideal voltage source), regardless of the value of the load resistance.\nThe theorem can be extended to alternating current circuits that include reactance, and states that maximum power transfer occurs when the load impedance is equal to the complex conjugate of the source impedance.\nThe mathematics of the theorem also applies to other physical interactions, such as:\nMaximizing power transfer versus power efficiency.\nThe theorem was originally misunderstood (notably by Joule) to imply that a system consisting of an electric motor driven by a battery could not be more than 50% efficient, since the power dissipated as heat in the battery would always be equal to the power delivered to the motor when the impedances were matched. \nIn 1880 this assumption was shown to be false by either Edison or his colleague Francis Robbins Upton, who realized that maximum efficiency was not the same as maximum power transfer. \nTo achieve maximum efficiency, the resistance of the source (whether a battery or a dynamo) could be (or should be) made as close to zero as possible. Using this new understanding, they obtained an efficiency of about 90%, and proved that the electric motor was a practical alternative to the heat engine.\nThe efficiency \"\u03b7\" is the ratio of the power dissipated by the load resistance \"R\"L to the total power dissipated by the circuit, which includes the voltage source's resistance of \"R\"S as well as \"R\"L:\nformula_1\nConsider three particular cases (note that voltage sources must have some resistance):\nImpedance matching.\nA related concept is reflectionless impedance matching. \nIn radio frequency transmission lines, and other electronics, there is often a requirement to match the source impedance (at the transmitter) to the load impedance (such as an antenna) to avoid reflections in the transmission line.\nCalculus-based proof for purely resistive circuits.\nIn the simplified model of powering a load with resistance \"R\"L by a source with voltage \"V\" and source resistance \"R\"S, then by Ohm's law the resulting current \"I\" is simply the source voltage divided by the total circuit resistance:\nformula_9\nThe power \"P\"L dissipated in the load is the square of the current multiplied by the resistance:\nformula_10\nThe value of \"R\"L for which this expression is a maximum could be calculated by differentiating it, but it is easier to calculate the value of \"R\"L for which the denominator:\nformula_11\nis a minimum. The result will be the same in either case. Differentiating the denominator with respect to \"R\"L:\nformula_12\nFor a maximum or minimum, the first derivative is zero, so\nformula_13\nor\nformula_14\nIn practical resistive circuits, \"R\"S and \"R\"L are both positive, so the positive sign in the above is the correct solution. \nTo find out whether this solution is a minimum or a maximum, the denominator expression is differentiated again:\nformula_15\nThis is always positive for positive values of formula_16 and formula_17, showing that the denominator is a minimum, and the power is therefore a maximum, when:\nformula_18\nThe above proof assumes fixed source resistance formula_16. When the source resistance can be varied, power transferred to the load can be increased by reducing formula_20. For example, a 100 Volt source with an formula_20 of formula_22 will deliver 250 watts of power to a formula_22 load; reducing formula_20 to formula_25 increases the power delivered to 1000 watts.\nNote that this shows that maximum power transfer can also be interpreted as the load voltage being equal to one-half of the Thevenin voltage equivalent of the source.\nIn reactive circuits.\nThe power transfer theorem also applies when the source and/or load are not purely resistive. \nA refinement of the maximum power theorem says that any reactive components of source and load should be of equal magnitude but opposite sign. (\"See below for a derivation.\") \nPhysically realizable sources and loads are not usually purely resistive, having some inductive or capacitive components, and so practical applications of this theorem, under the name of complex conjugate impedance matching, do, in fact, exist.\nIf the source is totally inductive (capacitive), then a totally capacitive (inductive) load, in the absence of resistive losses, would receive 100% of the energy from the source but send it back after a quarter cycle.\nThe resultant circuit is nothing other than a resonant LC circuit in which the energy continues to oscillate to and from. This oscillation is called reactive power. \nPower factor correction (where an inductive reactance is used to \"balance out\" a capacitive one), is essentially the same idea as complex conjugate impedance matching although it is done for entirely different reasons.\nFor a fixed reactive \"source\", the maximum power theorem maximizes the real power (P) delivered to the load by complex conjugate matching the load to the source.\nFor a fixed reactive \"load\", power factor correction minimizes the apparent power (S) (and unnecessary current) conducted by the transmission lines, while maintaining the same amount of real power transfer. \nThis is done by adding a reactance to the load to balance out the load's own reactance, changing the reactive load impedance into a resistive load impedance.\nProof.\nIn this diagram, AC power is being transferred from the source, with phasor magnitude of voltage formula_26 (positive peak voltage) and fixed source impedance formula_27 (S for source), to a load with impedance formula_28 (L for load), resulting in a (positive) magnitude formula_29 of the current phasor formula_30. This magnitude formula_29 results from dividing the magnitude of the source voltage by the magnitude of the total circuit impedance:\nformula_32\nThe average power formula_33 dissipated in the load is the square of the current multiplied by the resistive portion (the real part) formula_34 of the load impedance formula_28:\nformula_36\nwhere formula_37 and formula_34 denote the resistances, that is the real parts, and formula_39 and formula_40 denote the reactances, that is the imaginary parts, of respectively the source and load impedances formula_27 and formula_28.\nTo determine, for a given source, the voltage formula_43 and the impedance formula_44 the value of the load impedance formula_45 for which this expression for the power yields a maximum, one first finds, for each fixed positive value of formula_34, the value of the reactive term formula_40 for which the denominator:\nformula_48\nis a minimum. Since reactances can be negative, this is achieved by adapting the load reactance to:\nformula_49\nThis reduces the above equation to:\nformula_50\nand it remains to find the value of formula_34 which maximizes this expression. This problem has the same form as in the purely resistive case, and the maximizing condition therefore is formula_52\nThe two maximizing conditions:\ndescribe the complex conjugate of the source impedance, denoted by formula_55 and thus can be concisely combined to:\nformula_56"}

{"id": "76425", "revid": "50480727", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=76425", "title": "Kater's pendulum", "text": "Reversible free swinging pendulum\nA Kater's pendulum is a reversible free swinging pendulum invented by British physicist and army captain Henry Kater in 1817 (made public on 29 January 1818), for use as a gravimeter instrument to measure the local acceleration of gravity. Its advantage is that, unlike previous pendulum gravimeters, the pendulum's centre of gravity and center of oscillation do not have to be determined, allowing a greater accuracy. For about a century, until the 1930s, Kater's pendulum and its various refinements remained the standard method for measuring the strength of the Earth's gravity during geodetic surveys. It is now used only for demonstrating pendulum principles.\nDescription.\nA pendulum can be used to measure the acceleration of gravity \"g\" because for narrow swings (when the small angle approximation is valid) its period of swing \"T\" depends only on \"g\" and its length \"L\":\nformula_1\nSo by measuring the length \"L\" and period \"T\" of a pendulum, \"g\" can be calculated.\nThe Kater's pendulum consists of a rigid metal bar with two pivot points, one near each end of the bar. It can be suspended from either pivot and swung. It also has either an adjustable weight that can be moved up and down the bar, or one adjustable pivot, to adjust the periods of swing. In use, it is swung from one pivot, and the period timed, and then turned upside down and swung from the other pivot, and the period timed. The movable weight (or pivot) is adjusted until the two periods are equal. At this point the period \"T\" is equal to the period of an 'ideal' simple pendulum of length equal to the distance between the pivots. From the period and the measured distance \"L\" between the pivots, the acceleration of gravity can be calculated with great precision from the equation (1) above.\nThe acceleration due to gravity by Kater's pendulum is given by:\nformula_2\nwhere \"T\"1 and \"T\"2 are the time periods of oscillations when it is suspended from \"K\"1 and \"K\"2 respectively and \"\u2113\"1 and \"\u2113\"2 are the distances of knife edges \"K\"1 and \"K\"2 from the center of gravity respectively.\nHistory.\nGravity measurement with pendulums.\nThe first person to discover that gravity varied over the Earth's surface was French scientist Jean Richer, who in 1671 was sent on an expedition to Cayenne, French Guiana, by the French Acad\u00e9mie des Sciences, assigned the task of making measurements with a pendulum clock. Through the observations he made in the following year, Richer determined that the clock was &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;2+1\u20442 minutes per day slower than at Paris, or equivalently the length of a pendulum with a swing of one second there was &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;1+1\u20444 Paris \"lines\", or 2.6\u00a0mm, shorter than at Paris. It was realized by the scientists of the day, and proven by Isaac Newton in 1687, that this was due to the fact that the Earth was not a perfect sphere but slightly oblate; it was thicker at the equator because of the Earth's rotation. Since the surface was farther from the Earth's center at Cayenne than at Paris, gravity was weaker there. After that discovery was made, freeswinging pendulums started to be used as precision gravimeters, taken on voyages to different parts of the world to measure the local gravitational acceleration. The accumulation of geographical gravity data resulted in more and more accurate models of the overall shape of the Earth.\nPendulums were so universally used to measure gravity that, in Kater's time, the local strength of gravity was usually expressed not by the value of the acceleration \"g\" now used, but by the length at that location of the \"seconds pendulum\", a pendulum with a period of two seconds, so each swing takes one second. It can be seen from equation (1) that for a seconds pendulum, the length is simply proportional to \"g\":\nformula_3\nInaccuracy of gravimeter pendulums.\nIn Kater's time, the period \"T\" of pendulums could be measured very precisely by timing them with precision clocks set by the passage of stars overhead. Prior to Kater's discovery, the accuracy of \"g\" measurements was limited by the difficulty of measuring the other factor \"L\", the length of the pendulum, accurately. \"L\" in equation (1) above was the length of an ideal mathematical 'simple pendulum' consisting of a point mass swinging on the end of a massless cord. However the 'length' of a real pendulum, a swinging rigid body, known in mechanics as a compound pendulum, is more difficult to define. In 1673 Dutch scientist Christiaan Huygens in his mathematical analysis of pendulums, \"Horologium Oscillatorium\", showed that a real pendulum had the same period as a simple pendulum with a length equal to the distance between the pivot point and a point called the \"center of oscillation\", which is located under the pendulum's center of gravity and depends on the mass distribution along the length of the pendulum. The problem was there was no way to find the location of the center of oscillation in a real pendulum accurately. It could theoretically be calculated from the shape of the pendulum if the metal parts had uniform density, but the metallurgical quality and mathematical abilities of the time didn't allow the calculation to be made accurately.\nTo get around this problem, most early gravity researchers, such as Jean Picard (1669), Charles Marie de la Condamine (1735), and Jean-Charles de Borda (1792) approximated a simple pendulum by using a metal sphere suspended by a light wire. If the wire had negligible mass, the center of oscillation was close to the center of gravity of the sphere. But even finding the center of gravity of the sphere accurately was difficult. In addition, this type of pendulum inherently wasn't very accurate. The sphere and wire didn't swing back and forth as a rigid unit, because the sphere acquired a slight angular momentum during each swing. Also the wire stretched elastically during the pendulum's swing, changing \"L\" slightly during the cycle.\nKater's solution.\nHowever, in \"Horologium Oscillatorium\", Huygens had also proved that the pivot point and the center of oscillation were interchangeable. That is, if any pendulum is suspended upside down from its center of oscillation, it has the same period of swing, and the new center of oscillation is the old pivot point. The distance between these two conjugate points was equal to the length of a simple pendulum with the same period.\nAs part of a committee appointed by the Royal Society in 1816 to reform British measures, Kater had been contracted by the House of Commons to determine accurately the length of the seconds pendulum in London. He realized Huygens' principle could be used to find the center of oscillation, and so the length \"L\", of a rigid (compound) pendulum. If a pendulum were hung upside down from a second pivot point that could be adjusted up and down on the pendulum's rod, and the second pivot were adjusted until the pendulum had the same period as it did when swinging right side up from the first pivot, the second pivot would be at the center of oscillation, and the distance between the two pivot points would be \"L\".\nKater was not the first to have this idea. French mathematician Gaspard de Prony first proposed a reversible pendulum in 1800, but his work was not published until 1889. In 1811 Friedrich Bohnenberger again discovered it, but Kater independently invented it and was first to put it in practice.\nThe pendulum.\nKater built a pendulum consisting of a brass rod about 2 meters long, &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;1+1\u20442 inches wide and one-eighth inch thick, with a weight \"(d)\" on one end. For a low friction pivot he used a pair of short triangular 'knife' blades attached to the rod. In use the pendulum was hung from a bracket on the wall, supported by the edges of the knife blades resting on flat agate plates. The pendulum had two of these knife blade pivots \"(a)\", facing one another, about a meter (40\u00a0in) apart, so that a swing of the pendulum took approximately one second when hung from each pivot.\nKater found that making one of the pivots adjustable caused inaccuracies, making it hard to keep the axis of both pivots precisely parallel. Instead he permanently attached the knife blades to the rod, and adjusted the periods of the pendulum by a small movable weight \"(b,c)\" on the pendulum shaft. Since gravity only varies by a maximum of 0.5% over the Earth, and in most locations much less than that, the weight had to be adjusted only slightly. Moving the weight toward one of the pivots decreased the period when hung from that pivot, and increased the period when hung from the other pivot. This also had the advantage that the precision measurement of the separation between the pivots had to be made only once.\nExperimental procedure.\nTo use, the pendulum was hung from a bracket on a wall, with the knife blade pivots supported on two small horizontal agate plates, in front of a precision pendulum clock to time the period. It was swung first from one pivot, and the oscillations timed, then turned upside down and swung from the other pivot, and the oscillations timed again. The small weight \"(b)\" was adjusted with the adjusting screw, and the process repeated until the pendulum had the same period when swung from each pivot. By putting the measured period \"T\", and the measured distance between the pivot blades \"L\", into the period equation (1), \"g\" could be calculated very accurately.\nKater performed 12 trials. He measured the period of his pendulum very accurately using the clock pendulum by the \"method of coincidences\"; timing the interval between the \"coincidences\" when the two pendulums were swinging in synchronism. He measured the distance between the pivot blades with a microscope comparator, to an accuracy of 10\u22124 in. (2.5 \u03bcm). As with other pendulum gravity measurements, he had to apply small corrections to the result for a number of variable factors:\nHe gave his result as the length of the seconds pendulum. After corrections, he found that the mean length of the solar seconds pendulum at London, at sea level, at , swinging in vacuum, was 39.1386\u00a0inches. This is equivalent to a gravitational acceleration of 9.81158\u00a0m/s2. The largest variation of his results from the mean was . This represented a precision of gravity measurement of 0.7\u00d710\u22125 (7 milligals).\nIn 1824, the British Parliament made Kater's measurement of the seconds pendulum the official backup standard of length for defining the yard if the yard prototype was destroyed.\nUse.\nThe large increase in gravity measurement accuracy made possible by Kater's pendulum established gravimetry as a regular part of geodesy. To be useful, it was necessary to find the exact location (latitude and longitude) of the 'station' where a gravity measurement was taken, so pendulum measurements became part of surveying. Kater's pendulums were taken on the great historic geodetic surveys of much of the world that were being done during the 19th century. In particular, Kater's pendulums were used in the Great Trigonometric Survey of India.\nReversible pendulums remained the standard method used for absolute gravity measurements until they were superseded by free-fall gravimeters in the 1950s.\nRepsold\u2013Bessel pendulum.\nRepeatedly timing each period of a Kater pendulum, and adjusting the weights until they were equal, was time-consuming and error-prone. Friedrich Bessel showed in 1826 that this was unnecessary. As long as the periods measured from each pivot, \"T\"1 and \"T\"2, are close in value, the period \"T\" of the equivalent simple pendulum can be calculated from them:\nformula_4\nHere formula_5 and formula_6 are the distances of the two pivots from the pendulum's center of gravity. The distance between the pivots, formula_7, can be measured with great accuracy. formula_5 and formula_6, and thus their difference formula_10, cannot be measured with comparable accuracy. They are found by balancing the pendulum on a knife edge to find its center of gravity, and measuring the distances of each of the pivots from the center of gravity. However, because formula_11 is so much smaller than formula_12, the second term on the right in the above equation is small compared to the first, so formula_10 doesn't have to be determined with high accuracy, and the balancing procedure described above is sufficient to give accurate results.\nTherefore, the pendulum doesn't have to be adjustable at all, it can simply be a rod with two pivots. As long as each pivot is close to the center of oscillation of the other, so the two periods are close, the period \"T\" of the equivalent simple pendulum can be calculated with equation (2), and the gravity can be calculated from \"T\" and \"L\" with (1).\nIn addition, Bessel showed that if the pendulum was made with a symmetrical shape, but internally weighted on one end, the error caused by effects of air resistance would cancel out. Also, another error caused by the non-zero radius of the pivot knife edges could be made to cancel out by interchanging the knife edges.\nBessel didn't construct such a pendulum, but in 1864 Adolf Repsold, under contract to the Swiss Geodetic Commission, developed a symmetric pendulum 56\u00a0cm long with interchangeable pivot blades, with a period of about &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;3\u20444 second. The Repsold pendulum was used extensively by the Swiss and Russian Geodetic agencies, and in the Survey of India. Other widely used pendulums of this design were made by Charles Peirce and C. Defforges.\nInternational Association of Geodesy.\nThe 1875 Conference of the European Arc Measurement dealt with the best instrument to be used for the determination of gravity. The association decided in favor of the reversion pendulum and it was resolved to redo in Berlin, in the station where Friedrich Wilhelm Bessel made his famous measurements, the determination of gravity by means of devices of various kinds employed in different countries, in order to compare them and thus to have the equation of their scales, after an in-depth discussion in which an American scholar, Charles Sanders Peirce, took part. Indeed, as the figure of the Earth could be inferred from variations of the seconds pendulum length, the United States Coast Survey's direction instructed Charles Sanders Peirce in the spring of 1875 to proceed to Europe for the purpose of making pendulum experiments to chief initial stations for operations of this sort, in order to bring the determinations of the forces of gravity in America into communication with those of other parts of the world; and also for the purpose of making a careful study of the methods of pursuing these researches in the different countries of Europe.\nThe determination of gravity by the reversible pendulum was subject to two types of error. On the one hand the resistance of the air and on the other hand the movements that the oscillations of the pendulum imparted to its plane of suspension. These movements were particularly important with the apparatus designed by the Repsold brothers on the indications of Bessel, because the pendulum had a large mass in order to counteract the effect of the viscosity of the air. While Emile Plantamour was carrying out a series of experiments with this device, Adolph Hirsch found a way to demonstrate the movements of the pendulum's suspension plane by an ingenious process of optical amplification. Isaac-Charles \u00c9lis\u00e9e Cell\u00e9rier, a mathematician from Geneva and Charles Sanders Peirce would independently develop a correction formula that allowed the use of the observations made with this type of gravimeter.\nPresident of the Permanent Commission of the European Arc Measurement from 1874 to 1886, Carlos Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez de Ibero became the first president of the International Geodetic Association (1887\u20131891) after the death of Johann Jacob Baeyer. Under Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez's presidency, the International Geodetic Association acquired a global dimension with the accession of the United States, Mexico, Chile, Argentina and Japan. As a result of the work of the International Geodetic Association, in 1901, Friedrich Robert Helmert found, mainly by gravimetry, parameters of the ellipsoid remarkably close to reality.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The Treaty of Nice reformed the institutional structure of the European Union to withstand eastward expansion, a task which was originally intended to have been done by the Amsterdam Treaty, but failed to be addressed at the time.\nThe entry into force of the treaty was in doubt for a time, after its initial rejection by Irish voters in a referendum in June 2001. This referendum result was reversed in a subsequent referendum held a little over a year later.\nProvisions of the treaty.\nThe Nice Treaty was attacked by many people as a flawed compromise. Germany had demanded that its greater population be reflected in a higher vote weighting in the Council; this was opposed by France, who insisted that the symbolic parity between France and Germany be maintained. The Commission had proposed to replace the old weighted voting system with a double majority system which would require those voting in favour to represent a majority of both member states and population for a proposal to be approved. This was also rejected by France for similar reasons. A compromise was reached, which provided for a double majority of Member States and votes cast, and in which a Member State could optionally request verification that the countries voting in favour represented a sufficient proportion of the EU's population.\nThe Treaty provided for an increase after enlargement of the number of seats in the European Parliament to 732, which exceeded the cap established by the Treaty of Amsterdam.\nThe question of a reduction in the size of the European Commission after enlargement was resolved to a degree \u2014 the Treaty providing that once the number of Member States reached 27, the number of Commissioners appointed in the subsequent Commission would be reduced by the Council to below 27, but without actually specifying the target of that reduction. As a transitional measure it specified that after 1 January 2005, Germany, France, the United Kingdom, Italy and Spain would each give up their second Commissioner.\nThe Treaty provided for the creation of subsidiary courts below the European Court of Justice and the Court of First Instance (now the General Court) to deal with special areas of law such as patents.\nThe Treaty of Nice provides for new rules on closer co-operation, the rules introduced in the Treaty of Amsterdam being viewed as unworkable, and hence these rules have not yet been used.\nIn response to the failed sanctions against Austria following a coalition including J\u00f6rg Haider's party having come to power, and fears about possible future threats to the stability of the new member states to be admitted in enlargement, the Treaty of Nice added a preventive mechanism to sanctions against a Member State that was created by the Amsterdam Treaty.\nThe Treaty also contained provisions to deal with the financial consequences of the expiry of the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) treaty (Treaty of Paris (1951)).\nThe Irish referendums.\nUnder the current rules for the amendment of the Treaties, the Treaties can only be amended by a new Treaty, which must be ratified by each of the Member States to enter into force.\nIn all the EU member states the Treaty of Nice was ratified by parliamentary procedure, except in Ireland where, following the decision of the Irish supreme court in \"Crotty v An Taoiseach\", any amendments that result in a transfer of sovereignty to the European Union require a constitutional amendment. Ireland's Constitution can only be amended by a referendum.\nFirst referendum.\nTo the surprise of the Irish government and the other EU member states, Irish voters rejected the Treaty of Nice in June 2001. The turnout itself was low (34%), partly a result of the failure of the major Irish political parties to mount a strong campaign on the issue, presuming that the Irish electorate would pass the Treaty as all previous such Treaties had been passed by big majorities.\nHowever, many Irish voters were critical of the Treaty contents, believing that it marginalised smaller states. Others questioned the impact of the Treaty on Irish neutrality. Other sections viewed the leadership of the Union as out of touch and arrogant, with the Treaty offering a perceived chance to 'shock' the European leadership into a greater willingness to listen to its critics. (A similar argument was made when Denmark initially voted down the Treaty of Maastricht.)\nSecond referendum.\nThe Irish government, having obtained the Seville Declaration on Ireland's policy of military neutrality from the European Council, decided to have another referendum on the Treaty of Nice on Saturday, 19 October 2002. Two significant qualifications were included in the second proposed amendment, one requiring the consent of the D\u00e1il for enhanced cooperation under the treaty, and another preventing Ireland from joining any EU common defence policy. A 'Yes' vote was urged by a massive campaign by the main parties and by civil society and the social partners, including campaigning through canvassing and all forms of media by respected pro-European figures like then EP president Pat Cox, former Czech president V\u00e1clav Havel, former President of Ireland Patrick Hillery and former Taoiseach (prime minister) Dr. Garret FitzGerald. Prominent civil society campaigns on the Yes side included Fianna F\u00e1il, Fine Gael, the Labour Party, the Progressive Democrats, the Irish Alliance for Europe led by Professor Brigid Laffan and Adrian Langan, and Ireland for Europe led by Ciar\u00e1n Toland. On the No Side, the principal campaigns were those of the Green Party, Sinn F\u00e9in, Anthony Coughlan's National Platform, Justin Barrett's No to Nice campaign, and Roger Cole's Peace and Neutrality Alliance. The result was a 60% \"Yes\" vote on a near-50% turn-out.\nBy then, all other EU member states had ratified the Treaty. Ratification by all parties was required by the end of the year, or else the Treaty would have expired.\nViews of the treaty.\nProponents of the Treaty claimed it was a utilitarian adjustment to cumbersome EU governing mechanisms and a required streamlining of the decision-making process, necessary to facilitate enlargement of the EU into Central and Eastern Europe. They claim that, consequently, the treaty was vitally important for the integration and future progress of these former Eastern Bloc countries. Many people who were in favour of greater scope and power of the EU project felt that it did not go far enough and that it would in any case be superseded by future treaties. Proponents differed in the extent to which enlargement may have proceeded without the Treaty: some claimed that the very future of the Union's growth\u2014if not existence\u2014was at stake, while others said that enlargement could have legally proceeded\u2014albeit at a slower pace\u2014without it.\nOpponents of the Treaty claimed that it was a \"technocratic\" rather than \"democratic\" treaty, which would further diminish the sovereignty of national and regional parliaments, and would further concentrate power into a centralised and unaccountable bureaucracy. They also claimed that five applicant countries could have joined the EU without changing the EU's rules, and that others could have negotiated on an individual basis, something opponents to the treaty argued would have been to the applicants' advantage. They also claimed that the Treaty of Nice would create a two-tier EU, which might marginalise Ireland. Opponents pointed out that leading pro-treaty politicians had admitted that if referendums had been held in countries other than Ireland, it would probably have been defeated there as well.\nCriticism.\nThe Commission and the European Parliament were disappointed that the Nice Intergovernmental Conference (IGC) did not adopt many of their proposals for reform of the institutional structure or introduction of new Community powers, such as the appointment of a European Public Prosecutor. The European Parliament threatened to pass a resolution against the Treaty; the Italian Parliament threatened it would not ratify it without the former's support. However, in the end this did not come to pass and the European Parliament approved the Treaty.\nMany argue that the pillar structure, which was maintained by the Treaty, is overcomplicated; that the separate Treaties should be merged into one Treaty; that the three (now two) separate legal personalities of the Communities should be merged; and that the European Community and the European Union should be merged, with the European Union being endowed with legal personality. The German regions were also demanding a clearer separation of the powers of the Union from the Member States.\nNor did the Treaty of Nice deal with the question of the incorporation of the Charter of Fundamental Rights into the Treaty; that was also left for the 2004 IGC after the opposition of the United Kingdom.\nSignatures.\nWithdrawal.\nAt the end of January 2020 (GMT), the UK left the EU and so withdrew from this Treaty.\nEU evolution timeline.\nSince the end of World War II, most sovereign European countries have entered into treaties and thereby co-operated and harmonised policies (or \"pooled sovereignty\") in an increasing number of areas, in the European integration project or the \"construction of Europe\" (). The following timeline outlines the legal inception of the European Union (EU)\u2014the principal framework for this unification. The EU inherited many of its present organizations, institutions, and responsibilities from the European Communities (EC), which were founded in the 1950s in the spirit of the Schuman Declaration.\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The sacrament is more commonly known in Western Christianity as confirmation, although some languages such as Italian, Maltese and Portuguese normally use the terms \"cresima\", \"gri\u017cma (tal-isqof)\" and \"crisma\" (\"chrismation\") rather than \"confermazione\", \"konferma\" or \"confirma\u00e7\u00e3o\", respectively (\"confirmation\").\nThe term \"chrismation\" comes about because it involves anointing the recipient of the sacrament with chrism (holy oil), which according to eastern Christian belief, the Apostles sanctified and introduced for all priests to use as a replacement for the laying on of hands by the Apostles.\nChrism consists of a \"mixture of 40 sweet-smelling substances and pure olive oil\" sanctified by a bishop with some older chrism added in, in the belief that some trace of the initial chrism sanctified by the Apostles remains therein.\nLiturgical form.\nEastern Orthodox Church.\nCommon part of the rite.\nThe priest anoints the recipient with chrism, making the sign of the cross on the forehead, eyes, nostrils, mouth, ears, breast, hands, and feet using the following words each time: \"The seal of the gift of the Holy Ghost\" (in Greek: ; in ).\nThe chrism is washed off by a priest seven days later, according to the written rubrics, the newly baptized wearing their white chitons and not washing their anointed parts for that period. However, in the case of infant baptism (and often also with adult chrismation contemporary practice), the ablution is performed immediately after the rite of chrismation.\nAs part of the baptismal rite.\nTypically, one becomes a member of the Church by baptism and chrismation performed by a priest as a single service, or subsequent to baptism performed by a layman. While chrismation is often performed without baptism, baptism is never performed without chrismation; hence the term \"baptism\" is construed as referring to the administration of both sacraments (or mysteries), one after the other.\nAt the reconciliation of apostates.\nIn the Eastern Orthodox Church the mystery may be conferred more than once as it is customary to receive apostates by repeating chrismation; according to the \"Book of Needs\", the priest \"taking the Holy Chrism, he anoints him (her) according to the order of those who are baptized ...\" towards the end of the \"Prayers of Purification for One Returning to the True Faith from Apostasy\".\nThis practice is thus attested to in the ninth century by Saint Methodius of Constantinople in \"The Rule of Methodius, Patriarch of Constantinople, Concerning the Return from Apostasy of Various Persons to the True Orthodox Faith\":\nIf a child ... is in apostasy ... let him be washed. Upon leaving the bath, girded with a linen cloth, let him be anointed with Chrism, as one who is baptized. And let him put on a new robe in the manner of those who have been baptized.\nIf ... one who is of age has renounced his impending torment ... then let him be washed and anointed with Chrism according to the accepted Rite. And when the Liturgy is celebrated, let him be counted worthy of the Holy Things, occupying himself in Church and the Liturgy, as them that are baptized ...\nAt the reception of certain converts.\nAlthough normally administered in conjunction with baptism, in some cases chrismation alone may be used to receive converts to Orthodoxy through the exercise of \"economia\". Although practice in this regard varies, in general, if a convert comes to Orthodoxy from another Christian confession and has previously undergone a rite of baptism in the Trinitarian Formula (\"in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost\"), he or she may be received into the Orthodox Church through the sacrament of chrismation, after which he or she would receive the Holy Eucharist. On the other hand, if a convert comes from a group which practices an invalid, non-Trinitarian baptism (such as Mormons, Jehovah's Witnesses, or Oneness Pentecostals) or from one that does not practice baptism at all (such as Quakers or The Salvation Army), baptism is a prerequisite for chrismation\u2014an initiate must always be validly baptized in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost before any further sacraments can be administered. The use of \"economia\" is at the discretion of, and subject to the guidelines imposed by, the local bishop. Converts from non-Christian religions also need to be baptized before chrismation.\nThe sacrament of chrismation is an extension of the day of Pentecost, when the Holy Ghost was poured out on the Apostles. It is by chrismation that a person becomes a layperson \u2014 a member of the \"laos\" (laity), the people of God. Metropolitan Kallistos (Timothy Ware) explains:\nThrough Chrismation every member of the Church becomes a prophet, and receives a share in the royal priesthood of Christ; all Christians alike, because they are chrismated, are called to act as conscious witnesses to the Truth. \"You have an anointing (\"chrisma\") from the Holy One, and know all things\" ().\nOriental Orthodox churches.\nChrismation in Oriental Orthodoxy is similar to that of Eastern Orthodoxy but is performed according to their sacramental theology, and may vary according to the particular church.\nSacramental theology.\nEastern Churches.\nWhereas in Western Christian theology, confirmation is seen as completing or sealing of the baptismal covenant, the conferral of full membership, the perfecting one's bond with the Church, and/or the strengthening of gifts of the Holy Ghost to enable the recipient to live the Christian life, in the Eastern Orthodox tradition chrismation is understood more fundamentally as the bestowal of the Holy Ghost\u2014that is, as the transmission to that person of the experience of the Day of Pentecost (cf. Acts of the Apostles 2:1-4ff), along with the attendant gifts of the Spirit that are given to all the faithful, and any unique or special gifts that God deems appropriate for that person, to enable him or her to realize his or her intended potentiality as a child of God and as a unique member of Christ's Body, the Church. Hence the significance of the sacrament or mystery of chrismation is understood quite distinctly from that of baptism, much as Pentecost is distinct from the Passion and Resurrection.\nWhereas in the western churches (e.g. Roman Catholic and Anglican) confirmation is typically reserved to those of \"the age of reason\", chrismation in the Eastern churches (including Eastern Rite Catholic Churches) is ordinarily administered immediately after baptism, most commonly infant baptism. After receiving this sacrament, the recipient is eligible to receive the Eucharist; one who has not been chrismated is viewed as not qualified to receive the Eucharist, since they have not yet received the Holy Ghost. Baptism is followed immediately (or at least soon afterwards) by the person's first reception of Holy Communion.\nThe sacramental rite of chrismation may be performed by a presbyter (priest). In the Eastern tradition, chrismation shows the unity of the church through the bishop in the continuation of the Apostolic faith, because the chrism used is prepared and consecrated by a bishop (normally the leading bishop of an autocephalous Church, or \u2013 for some autocephalous churches \u2013 by the Patriarch of Constantinople) and is presented to the priest by the bishop and (together with the antimension) and is the symbol of the priest's permission from the bishop to perform the sacraments (see faculty). Although priests in the Eastern churches are universally granted this faculty, it is thus ultimately considered a sacrament granted by a bishop and associated with that Apostolic office. Furthermore, because some of the previously sanctified chrism is mixed with the newly sanctified chrism, there is a belief that the chrism contains a remnant of, or at least a connection to, the same chrism which was sanctified by the Apostles in the first century, and thus is a symbol of apostolic succession.\nOriental Orthodox.\nThe Coptic Orthodox Church follows a tradition that states while the Apostles used to give Confirmation by the laying on of the hands, they found they were not able to travel to lay hands as the number of converts grew. Thus they ordered the collection of the spices which were used to anoint Christ's body, and they were mixed with oil, forming, according to Coptic tradition, the first chrism, or \"myron\", which, according to tradition, was brought to Egypt by St Mark. The Coptic communion believes that, since that time, the \"myron\" has been remade 41 times.\nAssyrian Church of the East.\nSome similar views to the Orthodox Churches regarding sacramental theology of chrismation are held by the Assyrian Church of the East, which recognizes only two ecumenical councils, the First Council of Nicaea and the First Council of Constantinople.\nReferences.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is adjacent to the United States Bullion Depository (also known as Fort Knox), which is used to house a large portion of the United States' official gold reserves, and with which it is often conflated.\nThe base covers parts of Bullitt, Hardin and Meade counties. It currently holds the Army Human Resources Center of Excellence, including the Army Human Resources Command. It is named in honor of Henry Knox, Chief of Artillery in the American Revolutionary War and the first United States Secretary of War.\nFor 60 years, Fort Knox was the home of the U.S. Army Armor Center and School, and was used by both the Army and the Marine Corps to train crews on the American tanks of the day; the last was the M1 Abrams main battle tank. The history of the U.S. Army's Cavalry and Armored forces, and of General George S. Patton's career, is shown at the General George Patton Museum on the grounds of Fort Knox.\nIn 2011, the U.S. Army Armor School moved to Fort Benning, Georgia, where the Infantry School is also based. In 2014, the U.S. Army Cadet Command relocated to Fort Knox and all summer training for ROTC cadets now takes place there.\nOn 16 October 2020, V Corps was reactivated at Fort Knox, just over seven years after the colors were last cased in Wiesbaden, Germany, in July 2013.\nBullion depository.\nThe United States Bullion Depository, often known as Fort Knox, is a fortified vault building adjacent to the Fort Knox Army Post. It is operated by the United States Department of the Treasury, and stores over half the country's gold reserves. It is protected by the United States Mint Police, and is well known for its physical security.\nThe depository was built by the Treasury in 1936 on land transferred to it from Fort Knox. Early shipments of gold totaling almost 13,000 metric tons were escorted by combat cars of the 1st U.S. Cavalry Regiment to the depository. It has in the past safeguarded other precious items, such as the original copies of both the Constitution of the United States and the United States Declaration of Independence.\nCensus-designated place.\nParts of the base in Hardin and Meade counties form a census-designated place (CDP), which had a population of 12,377 at the 2000 census, 10,124 at the 2010 census, and 7,742 at the 2020 census.\nCommemorations.\nThe General George Patton Museum of Leadership at Fort Knox includes an exhibit \"highlighting leadership issues\" that arose from the attacks of 11 September 2001; the exhibit includes two firetrucks, one of which, designated \"Foam 161\", was partially charred and melted in the attack upon the Pentagon.\nFort Knox is also the location of the United States Army's Human Resources Command's Timothy Maude Center of Excellence, named in honor of Lieutenant General Timothy Maude, the highest-ranking member of the U.S. military to die in the attacks of 11 September 2001.\nHistory.\nFortification.\nFortifications were constructed near the site in 1861, during the Civil War when Fort Duffield was constructed. Fort Duffield was located on what was known as Muldraugh Hill on a strategic point overlooking the confluence of the Salt and Ohio Rivers and the Louisville and Nashville Turnpike. The area was contested by both Union and Confederate forces. Bands of organized guerrillas frequently raided the area during the war. John Hunt Morgan and the 2nd Kentucky Cavalry Regiment of the Confederate Army raided the area before staging his infamous raid across Indiana and Ohio.\nPost Civil War.\nAfter the Civil War, the area now occupied by the Army was home to various small communities. In October 1903, military maneuvers for the Regular Army and the National Guards of several states were held at West Point, Kentucky, and the surrounding area. In April 1918, field artillery units from Camp Zachary Taylor arrived at West Point for training. near the village of Stithton were leased to the government and construction for a permanent training center was started in July 1918.\nNew camp.\nThe new camp was named after Henry Knox, the Continental Army's chief of artillery during the Revolutionary War and the country's first Secretary of War. The camp was extended by the purchase of a further in June 1918 and construction properly began in July 1918. The building program was reduced following the end of the war and reduced further following cuts to the army in 1921 after the National Defense Act of 1920. The camp was greatly reduced and became a semi-permanent training center for the 5th Corps Area for Reserve Officer training, the National Guard, and Citizen's Military Training Camps (CMTC). For a short while, from 1925 to 1928, the area was designated as \"Camp Henry Knox National Forest.\"\nAir Corps use.\nThe post contains Godman Army Airfield, which was used by the United States Army Air Corps and its successor, the United States Army Air Forces, as a training base during World War II. It was used by the Kentucky Air National Guard for several years after the war until they relocated to Standiford Field in Louisville. The airfield is still used by the United States Army Aviation Branch.\nProtection of America's founding documents.\nFor protection after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941, the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution of the United States and the Gettysburg Address were moved for safekeeping to the United States Bullion Depository until Major W. C. Hatfield ordered their release after the D-Day Landings on 19 September 1944.\nMechanized military unit occupation.\nIn 1931 a small force of the mechanized cavalry was assigned to Camp Knox to use it as a training site. The camp was turned into a permanent garrison in January 1932 and renamed Fort Knox. The 1st Cavalry Regiment arrived later in the month to become the 1st Cavalry Regiment (Mechanized).\nIn 1936 the 1st was joined by the 13th to become the 7th Cavalry Brigade (Mechanized). The site quickly became the center for mechanization tactics and doctrine. The success of the German mechanized units at the start of World War II was a major impetus to operations at the fort. A new Armored Force was established in July 1940 with its headquarters at Fort Knox with the 7th Cavalry Brigade becoming the 1st Armored Division.\nThe Armored Force School and the Armored Force Replacement Center were also sited at Fort Knox in October 1940, and their successors remained there until 2011, when the Armor School moved to Fort Benning, Georgia. The site was expanded to cope with its new role. By 1943, there were 3,820 buildings on . A third of the post has been torn down within the last ten years, with another third slated by 2010.\n1947 Universal Military Training Experimental Unit.\nIn 1947, Fort Knox hosted the Universal Military Training Experimental Unit, a six-month project that aimed to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of providing new 18\u201320 year-old Army recruits with basic military training that emphasized physical, mental, and spiritual well-being. This project was undertaken with the aim of persuading the public to support President Harry S. Truman's proposal to require all eligible American men to undergo universal military training.\n\"Stripes\" (1981) was filmed using the exterior of Fort Knox but did not show the inside of the facility for security reasons.\n1993 shooting.\nOn 18 October 1993, Arthur Hill went on a shooting rampage, killing three and wounding two more before attempting to take his own life, Hill shot and severely wounded himself. The shooting occurred at Fort Knox's Training Support Center. Prior to the incident, Hill's coworkers claimed they were afraid of being around a mentally unstable person who was at work. Hill died on 21 October of complications from his attempted suicide.\n2013 shooting.\nOn 3 April 2013, a civilian employee was shot and killed in a parking lot on post. The victim was an employee of the United States Army Human Resources Command and was transported to the Ireland Army Community Hospital, where he was pronounced dead. This shooting caused a temporary lockdown that was lifted around 7 p.m. the same day. U.S. Army Sgt. Marquinta E. Jacobs, a soldier stationed at Fort Knox, was charged on 4 April with the shooting. Jacobs pleaded guilty to charges of premeditated murder and aggravated assault, and was sentenced to 30 years in prison on 10 January 2014.\nHuman Resources Command.\nThe Army Human Resources Command Center relocated to Fort Knox from the Washington D.C./Virginia area beginning in 2009. New facilities are under construction throughout Fort Knox, such as the new Army Human Resource Center, the largest construction project in Fort Knox's history. It is a $185 million, three-story, complex of six interconnected buildings, occupying .\nIn May 2010, The Human Resource Center of Excellence, the largest office building in the state, opened at Fort Knox. It employs nearly 4,300 soldiers and civilians.\nEducation.\nThe Department of Defense Education Activity (DoDEA) operates on-post public schools for all sections of the property.

While the audience can see through this \"wall\", the convention assumes that the actors behave as if they cannot. From the 16th century onward, the rise of illusionism in staging practices\u2014culminating in the realism and naturalism of the theatre of the 19th\u2013century\u2014led to the development of the fourth wall concept.\nThe metaphor relates to the mise-en-sc\u00e8ne behind a proscenium arch. When a scene is set indoors and three of the room's walls are depicted onstage\u2014forming what is known as a box set\u2014the \"fourth\" wall lies along the line (technically called the proscenium) dividing the stage from the auditorium, effectively where the audience sits. However, the \"fourth wall\" is a theatrical convention, not a feature of set design. Actors ignore the audience, focus entirely on the fictional world of the play, and maintain immersion in a state that theatre practitioner Konstantin Stanislavski called \"public solitude\" \u2014the ability to behave privately while being observed, or to be \"alone in public.\" This convention applies regardless of the physical set, theatre building, or actors' proximity to the audience. In practice, actors often respond subtly to audience reactions, adjusting timing\u2014particularly for comedic moments\u2014to ensure lines are heard clearly despite laughter.\nBreaking the fourth wall refers to any point in time whence this convention is violated. This may include actors speaking directly to the audience, acknowledging the fiction of the play, or referencing themselves as characters. Such moments draw attention to the otherwise invisible wall, making them a form of metatheatre. A similar metareference occurs when actors in television or film make eye contact with the camera, momentarily suspending the usual convention of ignoring it. The phrase \"breaking the fourth wall\" is now used broadly in reference to similar moments across various media, including video games and books.\nHistory.\nThe acceptance of the fourth wall's transparency is part of the suspension of disbelief that allows audiences to experience fictional events as real. The concept is often attributed to philosopher, critic and dramatist Denis Diderot, who wrote in 1758 that actors and writers should \"imagine a huge wall across the front of the stage, separating you from the audience, and behave exactly as if the curtain had never risen\". In 1987, critic Vincent Canby described the fourth wall as \"that invisible scrim that forever separates the audience from the stage.\"\nDiderot's \"un grand mur\" became \"the fourth wall\" to Leigh Hunt when in 1807 referring to Mr. Bannister, wrote: \nIn the late 19th century, the concept was also referred to as \"fourth wall theory\" possibly arising from an article by Henry Irving in February 1879 explaining a stage device used in a production of Hamlet:\nThe first known use of \"fourth wall theory\" follows later that month in a comment on that article in the Glasgow Evening Post.\nTheatre.\nThe fourth wall was not a recognized concept in much of early dramatic history. Classical plays from ancient Greece through the Renaissance frequently included direct addresses to the audience, such as asides and soliloquies.\nThe fourth wall became an established convention with the rise of modern realistic theatre, which has led some artists to draw direct attention to it for dramatic or comic effect when a boundary is \"broken\" when an actor or character addresses the audience directly. Breaking the fourth wall is especially common in pantomime and children's theatre where\u2014for example, a character might ask the children for help, as when Peter Pan appeals to the audience to applaud in an effort to revive the fading Tinker Bell (\"If you believe in fairies, clap your hands!\").\nCinema.\nOne of the earliest recorded breakings of the fourth wall in serious cinema was in Mary MacLane's 1918 silent film \"Men Who Have Made Love to Me\", in which the enigmatic author \u2013 who portrays herself \u2013 interrupts the vignettes onscreen to address the audience directly.\nOliver Hardy often broke the fourth wall in his films with Stan Laurel, when he would stare directly at the camera to seek sympathy from viewers. Groucho Marx spoke directly to the audience in \"Animal Crackers\" (1930), and \"Horse Feathers\" (1932), in the latter film advising them to \"go out to the lobby\" during Chico Marx's piano interlude. Comedy films by Mel Brooks, Monty Python, and Zucker, Abrahams and Zucker frequently broke the fourth wall, such that with these films \"the fourth wall is so flimsy and so frequently shattered that it might as well not exist\", according to \"The A.V. Club\".\nWoody Allen broke the fourth wall repeatedly in his movie \"Annie Hall\" (1977), as he explained, \"because I felt many of the people in the audience had the same feelings and the same problems. I wanted to talk to them directly and confront them.\" His 1985 film \"The Purple Rose of Cairo\" features the breaking of the fourth wall as a central plot point.\nJerry Lewis wrote in his 1971 book \"The Total Filmmaker\", \"Some film-makers believe you should never have an actor look directly into the camera. They maintain it makes the audience uneasy, and interrupts the screen story. I think that is nonsense, and usually I have my actors, in a single, look direct into the camera at least once in a film, if a point is to be served.\" Martin and Lewis look directly at the audience in \"You're Never Too Young\" (1955), and Lewis and co-star Stella Stevens each look directly into the camera several times in \"The Nutty Professor\" (1963), and Lewis' character holds a pantomime conversation with the audience in \"The Disorderly Orderly\" (1964). The final scene of \"The Patsy\" (1964) is famous for revealing to the audience the movie as a movie, and Lewis as actor/director.\nOne of the most surprising dramatic examples occurs at the very end of the 1971 John Schlesinger film, \"Sunday Bloody Sunday\", when the main character, played by Peter Finch, directly addresses the audience, there being nothing in the characterisation or narrative up to that point to indicate that this may be a featured device.\nThe 2022 film \"Persuasion\" was criticized for its modernization take on the classic 1817 Jane Austen novel by having the main protagonist Anne Elliot (played by Dakota Johnson) constantly breaking the fourth wall by interacting with the audience.\nSelect theatrical screenings of Francis Ford Coppola's 2024 science fiction epic \"Megalopolis\", including its private industry screenings and world premiere at the 2024 Cannes Film Festival, had a person walk on stage in front of the projection screen and address the protagonist, Cesar, who seemingly breaks the fourth wall by replying in real time.\nTelevision.\nOn television, the fourth wall has broken throughout the history of the medium.\nFourth wall breakage is common in comedy, and is used frequently by Bugs Bunny and other characters in \"Looney Tunes\" and other later animated shows, as well as the live-action 1960s sketch comedy of \"Monty Python's Flying Circus\", which the troupe also brought to their feature films. With animated characters, this typically involves pretending that the characters are played by real actors, rather than acknowledging their true nature as animated drawings. George Burns regularly broke the fourth wall on \"The George Burns and Gracie Allen Show\" (1950).\nAnother convention of breaking the fourth wall is often seen on mockumentary sitcoms, including \"The Office\". Mockumentary shows that break the fourth wall poke fun at the documentary genre with the intention of increasing the satiric tone of the show. Characters in \"The Office\" directly speak to the audience during interview sequences. Characters are removed from the rest of the group to speak and reflect on their experiences. The person behind the camera, the interviewer, is also referenced when the characters gaze and speak straight to the camera. The interviewer, however, is only indirectly spoken to and remains hidden. This technique, when used in shows with complex genres, serves to heighten the comic tone of the show while also proving that the camera itself is far from a passive onlooker.\nAnother approach to breaking the fourth wall is through a central narrator character who is part of the show's events, but at times speaks directly to the audience. For example, Francis Urquhart in the British TV drama series \"House of Cards\", \"To Play the King\" and \"The Final Cut\" addresses the audience several times during each episode, giving the viewer comments on his own actions on the show. The same technique is also used, though less frequently, in the American adaptation of \"House of Cards\" by main character Frank Underwood.\nThe Netflix series \"A Series of Unfortunate Events\", based on Daniel Handler's book series of the same name, incorporates some of the narrative elements from the books by having Lemony Snicket as a narrator character (played by Patrick Warburton) speaking directly to the television viewer that frequently breaks the fourth wall to explain various literary wordplay in a manner similar to the book's narration. The protagonist of \"Fleabag\" also frequently uses the technique to provide exposition, internal monologues, and a running commentary to the audience.\nEvery episode of the sitcom \"Saved by the Bell\" breaks the fourth wall during the introduction by the character Zack Morris. Most episodes have several other fourth wall breaks. This is similar to how \"The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air\", \"Clarissa Explains It All\" and \"Malcolm in the Middle\" use fourth wall breaks to set up stories or have characters comment on situations. Showtime's \"Shameless\" has a main character breaking the fourth wall at every episode's beginning to deliberately criticize and threaten the viewers to emphasize the morally deficient plots and characters likely in an deliberate attempt to turn away any na\u00efve viewers to maintain the exclusiveness of the series, only to add to its popularity.\nFurthermore, breaking the fourth wall can also be used in meta-referencing in order to draw attention to or invite reflection about a specific in-universe issue. An example of this is in the first episode of the final season of the show \"Attack on Titan\", where a newly introduced character, Falco Grice, starts to hallucinate about events that took place in the last 3 seasons. This literary device utilises self-referencing to trigger media-awareness in the recipient, used to signpost the drastic shift in perspective from the Eldian to the Marleyan side, and can be employed in all sorts of media.\nThe use of breaking the fourth wall in television has sometimes been unintentional. In the \"Doctor Who\" episode \"The Caves of Androzani\", the character of Morgus looks directly at the camera when thinking aloud. This was due to actor John Normington misunderstanding a stage direction, but the episode's director, Graeme Harper, felt that this helped increase dramatic tension, and decided not to reshoot the scenes.\nInteractive children's show characters also commonly break the fourth wall to \"help\" the audience with the episodes of the shows.\nVideo games.\nGiven their interactive nature, nearly all video games break the fourth wall by asking for the player's participation and having user interface elements on the screen (such as explanations of the game's controls) that address the player rather than their character. Methods of fourth wall breaking within the narrative include having the character face the direction of the player/screen, having a self-aware character that recognizes that they are in a video game, or having secret or bonus content set outside the game's narrative that can either extend the game world (such as with the use of false documents) or provide \"behind the scenes\" type content. Such cases typically create a video game that includes a metafiction narrative, commonly presently characters in the game incorporating knowledge they are in a video game.\nFor example, in \"Doki Doki Literature Club!\", one of the characters named Monika is aware that she is a part of a video game, and at the end, communicates with the player. To progress further in the story, the player must remove the monika.chr file (an action they take outside of the game, i.e. through the computer's file system). The plot of the game \"OneShot\" revolves around the fictional universe of the game being a simulation running on the player's computer, with certain characters being aware of this fact and sometimes communicating directly with the player. In other cases of metafictional video games, the game alters the player's expectation of how the game should behave, which may make the player question if their own game system is at fault, helping to increase the immersion of the game.\nBut since video games are inherently much more interactive than traditional films and literature, defining what truly breaks the fourth wall in the video game medium becomes difficult. Steven Conway, writing for \"Gamasutra\", suggests that in video games, many purported examples of breaking the fourth wall are actually better understood as \"relocations\" of the fourth wall or expansions of the \"magic circle\" (the fictional game world) to encompass the player. This is in contrast to traditional fourth wall breaks, which break the audience's illusion or suspension of disbelief, by acknowledging them directly. Conway argues that this expansion of the magic circle in video games actually serves to more fully immerse a player into the fictional world rather than take the viewer out of the fictional world, as is more common in traditional fourth wall breaks. An example of this expansion of the magic circle can be found in the game \"\", in which the player receives an in-game email at their real-life email address and must visit out-of-game websites to solve some of the puzzles in the game. Other games may expand the magic circle to include the game's hardware. For example, \"X-Men\" for the Mega Drive/Genesis requires players to reset their game console at a certain point to reset the X-Men's in-game Hazard Room, while \"Metal Gear Solid\" asks the player to put the DualShock controller on their neck to simulate a back massage being given in-game.\nOther examples include the idle animation of Sonic the Hedgehog in his games where the on-screen character would look to the player and tap his foot impatiently if left alone for a while, a character in Super Paper Mario referring to the player as \u2018the great being\u2019 and one level of \"Max Payne\" has the eponymous character come to the realization he and other characters are in a video game and narrates what the player sees as part of the UI. \"Eternal Darkness\", which included a sanity meter, would simulate various common computer glitches to the player as the sanity meter drained, including the Blue Screen of Death. \"The Stanley Parable\" is also a well-known example of this, as the narrator from the game constantly tries to reason with the player, even going so far as to beg the player to switch off the game at one point.\nLiterature.\nThe method of breaking the fourth wall in literature is a metalepsis (the transgression of narrative levels), which is a technique often used in metafiction. The metafiction genre occurs when a character within a literary work acknowledges the reality that they are in fact a fictitious being. The use of the fourth wall in literature can be traced back as far as \"The Canterbury Tales\" and \"Don Quixote\". \"Northanger Abbey\" is a late modern era example.\nIt was popularized in the early 20th century during the Post-Modern literary movement. Artists like Virginia Woolf in \"To the Lighthouse\" and Kurt Vonnegut in \"Breakfast of Champions\" used the genre to question the accepted knowledge and sources of the culture. The use of metafiction or breaking the fourth wall in literature varies from that on stage in that the experience is not communal but personal to the reader and develops a self-consciousness within the character/reader relationship that works to build trust and expand thought. This does not involve an acknowledgment of a character's fictive nature. Breaking the fourth wall in literature is not always metafiction.\nModern examples of breaking the fourth wall include Ada Palmer's \"Terra Ignota\", and William Goldman's \"The Princess Bride\".\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He began his studies at the University of Copenhagen at the age of 18. He wanted to make a career in medicine, but under the influence of chemist Sophus Mads J\u00f8rgensen decided to change to chemistry.\nWhile studying for his doctorate he worked as assistant in chemistry at the laboratory of the Technical University of Denmark, assisted in a geological survey of Denmark, and also worked as a consultant for the Royal Navy Dockyard.\nS\u00f8rensen was married twice. His second wife was Margrethe H\u00f8yrup S\u00f8rensen, who collaborated with him in his studies.\nWork.\nFrom 1901 to 1938, S\u00f8rensen was head of the prestigious Carlsberg Laboratory, Copenhagen. While working at the Carlsberg Laboratory he studied the effect of ion concentration on proteins and, because the concentration of hydrogen ions was particularly important, he introduced the pH-scale as a simple way of expressing it in 1909. The article in which he introduced the scale (using the notation formula_1) was published in French and Danish as well as in German described two methods for measuring acidity which S\u00f8rensen and his students had refined. The first method was based on electrodes, whereas the second involved comparing the colours of samples and a preselected set of indicators. (S\u00f8rensen, 1909).\nFrom p. 134: \"Die Gr\u00f6\u00dfe der Wasserstoffionenkonzentration ... und die Bezeichnung formula_1 f\u00fcr den numerischen Wert des Exponent dieser Potenz ben\u00fctze.\" (The magnitude of the hydrogen ion concentration is accordingly expressed by the normality factor of the solution concerned, based on the hydrogen ions, and this factor is written in the form of a negative power of 10.

By the hydrogen ion exponent (formula_1) of a solution is thus understood the Briggsian logarithm of the reciprocal value of the normality factor of the solution, based on the hydrogen ions, and this factor is written in the form of a negative power of 10). \nStarting on p. 139, \"4.

He rejected all of them except two.\nFrom p. 144: \"Es gibt noch zwei Verfahrungsweisen, ... bzw. die colorimetrische Methode genannt.\" (There are still two procedures by which the hydrogen or hydroxyl ion concentration of a solution can be determined; namely, gas chain measurement and determination by means of indicators, also called the electrometric or colorimetric method.)

From the 17th century until the French Revolution (1789\u20131799), it was part of the combined Province of Guyenne and Gascony. The region is vaguely defined, and the distinction between Guyenne and Gascony is unclear; by some they are seen to overlap, while others consider Gascony a part of Guyenne. Most definitions put Gascony east and south of Bordeaux.\nIt is currently divided between the region of Nouvelle-Aquitaine (departments of Landes, Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Atlantiques, southwestern Gironde, and southern Lot-et-Garonne) and the region of Occitanie (departments of Gers, Hautes-Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es, southwestern Tarn-et-Garonne, and western Haute-Garonne).\nGascony was historically inhabited by Basque-related people who appear to have spoken a language similar to Basque. The name Gascony comes from the same root as the word Basque (see Wasconia below). From the Middle Ages until today, the Gascon language has been spoken, usually classified as a regional variety of the Occitan language.\nGascony is the land of d'Artagnan, who inspired Alexandre Dumas's character d'Artagnan in \"The Three Musketeers\", as well as the land of Cyrano de Bergerac, the eponymous character of the play by Edmond Rostand and the home of Emily St. Aubert, the central character of The Mysteries of Udolpho by Ann Radcliffe. It is also home to Henry III of Navarre, who later became king of France as Henry IV.\nHistory.\nAquitania.\nIn pre-Roman times, the inhabitants of Gascony were the Aquitanians (), who spoke a non-Indo-European language related to modern Basque.\nThe Aquitanians inhabited a territory limited to the north and east by the river Garonne, to the south by the Pyrenees mountain range, and to the west by the Atlantic Ocean. The Romans called this territory Aquitania, either from the Latin word (meaning \"water\"), in reference to the many rivers flowing from the Pyrenees through the area, or from the name of the Aquitanian Ausci tribe, in which case Aquitania would mean \"land of the Ausci\".\nIn the 50s BC, Aquitania was conquered by lieutenants of Julius Caesar and became part of the Roman Empire.\nLater, in 27 BC, during the reign of Emperor Augustus, the province of Gallia Aquitania was created. Gallia Aquitania was far larger than the original Aquitania, as it extended north of the Garonne, in fact all the way north to the river Loire, thus including the Celtic Gauls that inhabited the regions between the rivers Garonne and Loire.\nNovempopulana.\nIn 297, as Emperor Diocletian reformed the administrative structures of the Roman Empire, Aquitania was split into three provinces. The territory south of the Garonne River, corresponding to the original Aquitania, was made a province called Novempopulania (that is, \"land of the nine tribes\"), while the part of Gallia Aquitania north of the Garonne became the province of Aquitanica I and the province of Aquitanica II. The territory of Novempopulania corresponded mostly to that of modern Gascony.\nThe Aquitania Novempopulana or Novempopulania suffered like the rest of the Western Roman Empire from the invasions of Germanic tribes, most notably the Vandals in 407\u2013409. In 416\u2013418, Novempopulania was delivered to the Visigoths as their federate settlement lands and became part of the Visigoth kingdom of Toulouse, while other than the region of the Garonne river their actual grip on the area may have been rather loose.\nThe Visigoths were defeated by the Franks in 507, and fled into Spain and Septimania. Novempopulania then became part of the Frankish Kingdom like the rest of southern France. However, Novempopulania was far away from the home base of the Franks in northern France, and was only very loosely controlled by the Franks. During all the troubled and historically obscure period, starting from early 5th-century accounts, the bagaudae are often cited, social uprisings against tax exaction and feudalization, largely associated to Vasconic unrest.\nDuchy of Gascony.\nOld historical literature sometimes claims the Basques took control of the whole of Novempopulania in the Early Middle Ages, founding its claims on the testimony of Gregory of Tours, on the etymological link between the words \"Basque\" and \"Gascon\" \u2013 both derived from \"Vascones\" or \"Wasconia\", the latter being used to name the whole of Novempopulania.\nModern historians reject this hypothesis, which is sustained by no archeological evidence. For Juan Jos\u00e9 Larrea, and Pierre Bonnassie, \"a Vascon expansionism in Aquitany is not proved and is not necessary to understand the historical evolution of this region\". This Basque-related culture and race is, whatever the origin, attested in (mainly Carolingian) Medieval documents, while their exact boundaries remain unclear (\"Wascones, qui trans Garonnam et circa Pirineum montem habitant\" -- \"Wascones, who live across the Garonne and around the Pyrenees mountains\", as stated in the Royal Frankish Annals, for one).\nThe word \"Vasconia\" evolved into \"Wasconia\", and then into \"Gasconia\" (\"w\" often evolved into \"g\" under the influence of Romance languages; cf. \"warranty\" and \"guarantee\", \"warden\" and \"guardian\", \"wile\" and \"guile\", \"William\" and \"Guillaume\"). The gradual abandonment of the Basque-related Aquitanian language in favor of a local Vulgar Latin was not reversed. The replacing local Vulgar Latin evolved into Gascon. (for example, Latin \"f\" became \"h\"; cf. Latin , French , Spanish , Occitan , but Gascon ). \nMeanwhile, Viking raiders conquered several Gascon towns, among them Bayonne in 842\u2013844. Their attacks in Gascony may have helped the political disintegration of the duchy until their defeat by William II S\u00e1nchez of Gascony in 982. In turn, the weakened ethnic polity known as Duchy of Wasconia/Wascones, unable to get around the general spread of feudalization, gave way to a myriad of counties founded by Gascon lords.\nAngevin Empire.\nThe 1152 marriage of Henry II and Eleanor of Aquitaine allowed the former to gain control of his new wife's possessions of Aquitaine and Gascony. This addition to his already plentiful holdings made Henry the most powerful vassal in France.\nIn 1248, Simon de Montfort was appointed Governor in the unsettled Duchy of Gascony. Bitter complaints were excited by de Montfort's rigour in suppressing the excesses of both the seigneurs of the nobility and the contending factions in the great communes. Henry III yielded to the outcry and instituted a formal inquiry into Simon's administration. Simon was formally acquitted of the charges, but in August 1252 he was nevertheless dismissed. Henry then himself went to Gascony, pursuing a policy of conciliation; he arranged the marriage between Edward, his 14-year-old son, and Eleanor of Castile, daughter of Alfonso X. Alfonso renounced all claims to Gascony and assisted the Plantagenets against rebels such as Gaston de Bearn, who had taken control of the Pyrenees.\nIn December 1259, Louis IX of France ceded to Henry land north and east of Gascony. In return, Henry renounced his claim to many of the territories that had been lost by King John.\nIn May 1286, King Edward I paid homage before the new king, Philip IV of France, for the lands in Gascony. However, in May 1294, Philip confiscated the lands, initiating the Gascon War. Between 1294 and 1298, Edward sent three expeditionary forces to recover Gascony, but Philip was able to retain most of the territory until the Treaty of Paris in 1303.\nIn 1324, when Edward II of England in his capacity as Duke of Aquitaine failed to pay homage to the French king after a dispute, Charles IV declared the duchy forfeit at the end of June 1324, and military action by the French followed. Edward sent his wife Isabella, who was sister to the French king, to negotiate a settlement. The Queen departed for France on 9 March 1325, and in September was joined by her son, the heir to the throne, Prince Edward the later Edward III of England. Isabella's negotiations were successful, and it was agreed that the young Prince Edward would perform homage in the king's place, which he did on 24 September and so the duchy was returned to the English crown.\nWhen France's Charles IV died in 1328 leaving only daughters, his nearest male relative was Edward III of England, the son of Isabella, the sister of the dead king; but the question arose whether she could legally transmit the inheritance of the throne of France to her son even though she herself, as a woman, could not inherit the throne. The assemblies of the French barons and prelates and the University of Paris decided that males who derive their right to inheritance through their mother should be excluded. Thus the nearest heir through male ancestry was Charles IV's first cousin, Philip, Count of Valois, and it was decided that he should be crowned Philip VI of France. Philip believed that Edward III was in breach of his obligations as vassal, so in May 1337 he met with his Great Council in Paris. It was agreed that Gascony should be taken back into Philip's hands, thus precipitating the Hundred Years War between England and France. At the end of the Hundred Years' War, after Gascony had changed hands several times, the English were finally defeated at the Battle of Castillon on 17 July 1453; Gascony remained French from then on.\nProvince of Guyenne and Gascony.\nFrom the 17th century onwards, the government of Gascony was united with Guyenne. The government of Guyenne and Gascony (\"\"), with its capital at Bordeaux, lasted until the end of the \"Ancien R\u00e9gime\" in 1792.\nGeography.\nGascony is limited by the Atlantic Ocean (western limit) and the Pyrenees mountains (southern limit); as the area of Gascon language, it extends to the Garonne (North), and close to the Ari\u00e8ge (river) (East) from the Pyrenees to the confluence of the Garonne with the Ari\u00e8ge. The other most important river is Adour, along with its tributaries Gave de Pau and Gave d'Oloron.\nThe most important towns are:\nBayonne, Dax and Tarbes are crossed by the Adour. Pau and Lourdes are crossed by the Gave de Pau. Mont-de-Marsan also belongs to the drainage basin of the Adour. The Gers (river), a tributary of the Garonne, flows through Auch.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "76464", "revid": "2413055", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=76464", "title": "Batasuna", "text": "2001\u20132013 Basque political party in Spain\nBatasuna (; ) was a Basque nationalist political party. Based mainly in Spain, it was banned in 2003, after a court ruling declared proven that the party was financing ETA with public money.\nThe party is included in the \"European Union list of terrorist persons and organizations\" as a component of ETA. Right after having been banned, Batasuna still managed to organize or support some rallies, public actions and several workplace strikes. The Spanish ruling was appealed before and, later on, confirmed by the European Court of Human Rights.\nAs an association and not as a political party, Batasuna had a minor presence in the French Basque Country, where it remained legal as \"Batasuna\" until its self-dissolution in January 2013.\nBatasuna's ranks and support base have been represented under different names since it was first declared legal in the late 1970s with the Spanish Transition to democracy. Thus, Batasuna's predecessors were the original Herri Batasuna and, then, Euskal Herritarrok. After having been outlawed in 2003, Batasuna's core support revamped yet again by co-opting the thus far marginal parties EHAK and Acci\u00f3n Nacionalista Vasca (ANV).\nBatasuna was a part of the \"Basque National Liberation Movement\" which includes social organizations, trade unions, youth (Jarrai and Gazteriak, now merged in Haika and Segi), and women's groups (Egizan). Jarrai-Haika-Segi, Gestoras pro-Amnistia, Askatasuna and other groups closely related to Batasuna were also declared illegal by different court rulings on the same charges of having collaborated with or being part of ETA.\nHistory and outline.\nThe party was founded in April 1978 as Herri Batasuna, a coalition of leftist nationalist political groups mostly originating from Euskadiko Ezkerra initially brought together to advocate for \"no\" in the referendum to be held that year on the Spanish constitution.\nIts constituent parties had been called together by senior Basque nationalist Telesforo de Monz\u00f3n in a 1978 meeting called \"the table of Alsasua.\" Herri Batasuna's founding convention was held in Lekeitio, home of Santiago Brouard who was then the leader of HASI (Herriko Alderdi Sozialista Iraultzailea or Revolutionary Socialist People's Party). The party won 150,000 votes in the Basque Country (15%) and 22,000 additional votes in Navarre (9%) in its first Spanish general election in March 1979. Thus, they won three seats in the Spanish Parliament, which they did not occupy. Same happened in 1980 in the first elections to the Basque Parliament, in which HB stood as second political force, with 151,636 votes (16.55%) winning 11 seats. Its absence allowed a BNP-only Basque Government led by Carlos Garaikoetxea. On 20 November 1984 Brouard was assassinated by two members of the GAL. The killing is perhaps the only one performed by the GAL death squad within Spain itself.\nAnother well-known Herri Batasuna leader and newly elected Spanish MP, Josu Muguruza, was assassinated by right-wing extremists in November 1989 in Madrid. GAL claimed responsibility for Muguruza's assassination. Suspicions also centered on Spanish neo-Nazi group Bases Aut\u00f3nomas.\nRecent times.\nAmid the first talk of the Spanish government investigating the ties of Herri Batasuna with ETA, in 1998 Herri Batasuna was the driving force of the newly formed Euskal Herritarrok (\"We Basque Citizens\") coalition, an acronym which got the best results to date for Basque left separatism in the Basque community, with 224,000 votes out of a total of 1,250,000 in the Basque election held that year.\nThe most recent public party spokesmen was Arnaldo Otegi. Otegi, like a number of other top-ranks in Herri Batasuna, had been a member of ETA and served several years in prison for bank assault. He is currently serving time in prison for ties with ETA. \nAnother important member of Batasuna was Jos\u00e9 Antonio Urrutikoetxea Bengoetxea, alias Josu Ternera, the main leader of ETA between 1987 and 1989 and accused of a number of assassinations like the 1987 Hipercor bombing which killed 21 people at Hipercor - a shopping center in Barcelona. He was imprisoned in France after 1989, released after finishing his sentence and was transferred to Spanish prisons, where he stayed for two more years until his release by the Constitutional Court, which stipulated that he had served his prison term in France. He was included in the Batasuna electoral ticket and elected to the Basque parliament between 1999 and 2001, where he was appointed as his party's representative in the Human Rights commission at the Basque Parliament, which, given his criminal background caused a stir in the rest of parties. He disappeared when the Spanish courts reopened cold charges and presented new ones about his current membership in ETA. Presently he lives in hiding and is considered one of the leaders of ETA that are pushing for negotiations.\nAmid a period of separatist kale borroka street attacks on the offices of the Basque Nationalist Party and other establishment targets, Batasuna together with the union Langile Abertzaleen Batzordeak convoked a day of protest and general strike on 9 March 2006. On the morning of the strike, ETA detonated several bombs near highways, with no injuries. Employers reported scant overall participation in the strike, approximately 0.5% of private sector workers, 1% of government workers and 3\u20134% of workers in education. A few thousands of Batasuna militants joined protests, while others blocked rail lines and roads and occupied municipal halls Batasuna leader Arnaldo Otegi was ordered to appear in court to answer for the bomb attacks and disruption, but delayed his appearance repeatedly on the grounds of illness.\nIn September 2008, in what has been the closest to a disengagement of ETA so far, members of the party, while not condemning ETA's tactics whatsoever, did say the \"political-military strategy\" of the latter is an \"obstacle\" to aspirations for Basque independence. They called for a \"unifying project for the pro-independence left\" which would be aimed at creating an electoral list for regional elections to be held in Spring 2009.\nElectoral results.\nBatasuna's support in the elections to the parliament of the Basque Autonomous Community (under the three brands it has used, i.e., Herri Batasuna, Euskal Herritarrok and EHAK) oscillates around 15% of the total votes, its best result being the 18.33% achieved in 1990 and the lowest the 10.12% of the total votes obtained in 2001.\nIn Navarre its results in the elections to the Navarrese Foral parliament have been historically slightly less than 15% of the total votes, reaching their highest result in 1999 (15.95% of the total votes) and their lowest in 1995 (9.22% of the total votes). In this territory other Basque pro-independence left wing parties which reject violence and so remain legal - namely Batzarre and specifically, Aralar- eroded Batasuna's support in a more significant way than in the Basque Autonomous Community.\nBatasuna had representatives in the European Parliament and in the parliaments of Navarre and the provinces of the Basque Autonomous Community. It also ruled some 62 local councils, and had members in many more. While it was fairly represented in all Basque and Navarrese Spanish territories, Batasuna counted as its stronghold the province of Gipuzkoa. After being banned, Batasuna lost all its representatives in the Spanish Parliament, since regaining (under different names) some their seats in elections held after its banning.\nWhile the party has been barred from formally taking part in elections since 2003 (see below), it has coordinated a variety of forms of participation (or \"quantifiable non-participation\") in recent elections. After the May 2003 provincial and local elections, followers of the local lists protested claiming the council seats corresponding to the invalid votes (127,000, 10% of the total vote in the Basque Country).\nFor the Basque elections of 2005, Batasuna presented lists of candidates but they were dismissed as illegal. After the new election was held for the Basque regional parliament, Batasuna lost all their remaining elected representatives.\nLike those parties, representatives of EHAK refused to explicitly condemn the ETA attacks but, given the fact that elections were to be held in a matter of days, the courts did not have the time to assess EHAK's compliance with the Ley de Partidos. The People's Party requested that the Spanish government conducts investigations to ban EHAK-PCTV too, though the State Legal Service (\"Abogac\u00eda General del Estado\") and the Attorney General's Office (\"Fiscal\u00eda General del Estado\") found no evidence to support legal actions against the party. Batasuna asked their supporters to vote for EHAK.\nIn the Basque elections of 17 April 2005, EHAK obtained 150,188 votes (12.5%), entering the Basque Parliament with nine seats (all but one being women).\nSpanish Parliament.\nBatasuna stood in a number of elections for the Spanish Parliament. They first stood in 1979 obtaining their best results in the Basque autonomous community where they polled 15% and won three seats. In Navarre they polled almost 9% but failed to win a seat.\nThey lost a seat in the 1982 election. Their high point came in the 1986 election where they won 5 seats, including one seat in Navarre, the only occasion in which they have won a seat there. They lost their Navarre seat in the 1989 election and lost a further two seats in the 1996 election, which overall proved to be the party's worst performance in terms of vote share. At provincial level, their best results came in Guip\u00fazcoa where the party topped the poll in the 1989 general election.\nOutlawed in Spain.\nThe party denied any links to ETA. However, proponents of the party's illegalization pointed to a coincidence of Batasuna and ETA's strategies. A significant number of Batasuna leaders have been imprisoned because of their activities in ETA. The party has never condemned any attack by ETA and its leaders have referred sometimes to the ETA members as 'Basque soldiers', and justified their actions: \"ETA does not use the armed struggle as a mean to defend this or that political project but to give [the Basque Country] democratic channels that enable the popular will to be expressed in full freedom.\" It is also common to refer to ETA militants as \"Gudariak\", soldiers in Basque language.\nSince the 1980s, there had been talk of attempts to ban the party, which resulted in Batasuna frequently changing its name as part of the effort to avoid this, from the original \"Herri Batasuna\", then becoming part of the \"Euskal Herritarrok\" coalition in the 1990s and, finally, Batasuna. Members of the Basque left consider the Spanish government's efforts against Batasuna and its successors to be part of an organized campaign targeting the social support for the independence movement. They point to government crackdowns against the newspaper \"Egin\", the radio station Herri Irratia and the network of pubs that were gathering places for the independentist left.\nIn 2002, started the first serious attempt by the Spanish government to ban the party. In June, the parliament passed legislation that outlawed parties under certain conditions, on the grounds of their support for terrorism. In July Batasuna was fined \u20ac24 million for vandalism and street violence in 2001. Following an ETA car bomb attack on 4 August the Spanish parliament was recalled. The party was suspended for three years by Judge Baltasar Garz\u00f3n on 27 August to allow him to investigate the party links to ETA. Garz\u00f3n and the government presented 23 arguments for the ban, focusing on the party's refusal to condemn ETA attacks, its reference to detainees as political prisoners, collaboration with other banned abertzale forces, and ETA's support in communiqu\u00e9s for Batasuna's political strategy.\nIn 2003, Batasuna was declared illegal in Spain by a court ruling of the Spanish Supreme Court, then confirmed by the Constitutional Court of Spain. The decision automatically cut them off from the state funding received by all legal political parties with Parliament representation. In spite of legal text forbidding its reorganization under another name, its members tried to use, ever since the outlawing, a plethora of local lists. Most of these lists were considered to be a front for Batasuna by the Spanish Supreme Court. This decision was confirmed by the Spanish Constitutional Court. The ban prohibits their representatives from contesting elections, holding public demonstrations or rallies and freezes their assets. On the 26th the Spanish parliament voted for an indefinite ban, 295 to 10. The party's main offices in Pamplona were closed by the police and further offices in San Sebasti\u00e1n, Bilbao and Vitoria-Gasteiz were targeted.\nStill, party activity did not cease completely, as proved by the fact that on 4 October 2007 twenty-three top members of Batasuna were arrested as they left a secret meeting in Segura (Guip\u00fazcoa), accused of holding an illegal political meeting.\nSchism.\nPrior to the outlaw effort, a dissenting minority had left the party to form Aralar. While sharing separatist aims with Batasuna, Aralar rejected political violence and ETA's assassinations and therefore remains a legal party.\nAttempts to reorganize.\nIn spite of the prohibition of reorganizing under different names in order to circumvent the legal ruling, Batasuna's ranks have tried a series of attempts to reorganize under new names, which include, among others, Autodeterminaziorako Bilgunea, Aukera Guztiak, Askatasuna or D3M. All have been legally banned for alleged ties to Batasuna and, in turn, to ETA.\nIn May 2004, a list named \"Herritarren Zerrenda\" (\"Citizens' List\") was presented in Spain and France to the 2004 European Parliament election. Spanish tribunals rejected it, as a successor of Batasuna. However, the HZ list in France remained legal.\nHZ candidates in Spain then campaigned for using the French HZ ballot in Spain, which was to be counted as a null vote.\nThere were more than 98,000 null votes in the Basque Autonomous Country and more than 15,000 in Navarre. HZ leaders interpreted the high rate of null votes, which was 12% of the total, to mean that most of the nulls were for HZ, since in the previous European elections the null vote was less than 1%.\nA more successful strategy for Batasuna proved to be the one of co-opting existing marginal parties giving the shortest possible notice before an election, so that there was no time for the Spanish Supreme Court to legally assess the lawfulness of this move before the election was held. Thus, for the regional 2005 Basque parliamentary election the so-far marginal EHAK party announced that they were ready to bring the programs of Batasuna to the Basque regional parliament.\n(EHAK had been legally registered in 2002 but had no known activity until 2005). The party could participate in those elections, but then was declared illegal by a court ruling because of ties with Batasuna, which prevented it from contesting the 2007 Spanish regional elections.\nThen, the same strategy was tried by co-opting Acci\u00f3n Nacionalista Vasca a historical, yet basically inactive Basque party. This time, the Spanish Supreme Court could make a quick assessment of ANV's municipal candidates, which resulted in roughly half of them being banned (because the candidates included people who had previously run for the illegal Herri Batasuna or Batasuna) while the other half was ruled lawful and could participate in the elections to be held shortly after the ruling.\nThen, in September 2008 the full legal inquiry on the party was finalized, ruling that ANV as a whole was illegal, due to ties with Batasuna-ETA. The Basque regional government, then led by a Basque nationalist coalition of the PNV and EA objected to these legal rulings.\nAs a result of this pressure, for the first time since Herri Batasuna was formed, neither Batasuna nor its proxies could participate in the Basque regional parliament at the time of the 2009 Basque parliamentary election.\nIn February 2011, Sortu, a party described as \"the new Batasuna\", was launched. Unlike predecessor parties, Sortu claimed that it explicitly rejected politically motivated violence, including that of ETA; however it did not condemn the record of ETA nor ask for the disbandment of the armed organization. Sortu was banned in March 2011 from registering as a political party by the Supreme Court of Spain.\nSome members went on to form another party called Bildu, which was first banned but then allowed to register. Currently, it is Bildu which represents at the Parliament the electoral base of Batasuna.\nReaction.\nIn October 2008, demonstrations were held in Bilbao to protest a Supreme Court decision the month before to ban ANV and EHAK, because of their ties to Batasuna. The protesters had a banner that read \"Freedom for Euskal Herria.\" The protests was organised by left-wing Basque nationalists. ANV president, Kepa Bereziartua, and the former spokesman for Batasuna, Arnaldo Otegi, were present in the march.\nRulings of the European Court of Human Rights.\nAt the time of its outlawing in Spain, Batasuna lawyers took the case to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR). After a long legal inquiry, in July 2009 the ECHR backed the Spanish rulings banning Batasuna and its proxies.\nThe ECHR said that disbanding the parties was a response \"to a pressing social need\" given their ties to ETA. \"Given the situation in Spain for several years regarding terrorist attacks, these ties can be considered objectively as a threat to democracy,\" the court said, also adding that these parties \"contradicted the concept of a 'democratic society' and presented a major danger to Spain's democracy\".\nSimilarly, when the outlawed Batasuna tried to use Acci\u00f3n Nacionalista Vasca as a proxy to re-organize its ranks, in a different case the ECHR also upheld in 2011 the previous Spanish court rulings which had outlawed ANV, noting that this party had not run by itself in elections since 1977 and that it basically conformed a \"fraud\" to circumvent the outlawing of Batasuna.\nStatus in France.\nBatasuna has a minor presence in the Basque French country, where it runs elections as a civic organization, not like a political party. In France it used to get a few hundred votes\nand did not reach any kind of representation at either local or regional level so far.\nIn September 2008, 14 people were detained by the French police, 10 of whom were from the French-wing of the party (including their spokesman Xabi Larralde), and charged with links to ETA. They were released four days later; it remained unclear whether the ongoing investigation would lead to an illegalization process similar to that in Spain.\nIn January 2013, Batasuna in France announced its self-dissolution, citing a process of \"political reflection\".\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The \"Indies\" broadly referred to various lands in the East or the Eastern Hemisphere, particularly the islands and mainlands found in and around the Indian Ocean by Portuguese explorers, soon after the Cape Route was discovered. In a narrow sense, the term was used to refer to the Malay Archipelago, which today comprises the Philippine Archipelago, Indonesian Archipelago, Borneo, and New Guinea. Historically, the term was used in the Age of Discovery to refer to the coasts of the landmasses comprising the Indian subcontinent and the Indochinese Peninsula along with the Malay Archipelago.\nOverview.\nDuring the era of European colonization, territories of the Spanish Empire in Asia were known as the Spanish East Indies for 333 years before the American conquest and later the independence of the Philippines. Dutch occupied colonies in the area were known for about 300 years as the Dutch East Indies until Indonesian independence. The East Indies may also include the former French Indochina, former British territories Brunei, Hong Kong and Singapore and former Portuguese Macau and Timor. It does not, however, include the former Dutch New Guinea, which is geographically considered to be part of Melanesia.\nThe inhabitants of the East Indies are never called \"East Indians\", as they are not linguistically related to South Asia, most specifically the Indo-Aryan languages. It distinguishes them both from inhabitants of the Caribbean (which is also called the West Indies) and from the indigenous peoples of the Americas who are often called \"American Indians\". However, in colonial times, the non-Indian Southeast Asians were also called \"Indians\".\nPeoples of the East Indies comprise a wide variety of cultural diversity, and the inhabitants do not consider themselves as belonging to a single ethnic group. The region is mostly populated by the Austronesians, who first expanded from the island of Taiwan, and later on during the early modern period, when East Asians such as the Han Chinese started to migrate south and became known as the Peranakans or Straits Chinese.\nBuddhism, Christianity, Islam and Hinduism are the most popular religions throughout the region, while Sikhism, Jainism, Chinese folk religion and various other traditional beliefs and practices are also prominent in some areas. The major languages in this area draw from a wide variety of language families such as the Austronesian and Sino-Tibetan languages, and should not be confused with the term Indo-Aryan, a group of languages spoken in the Indian subcontinent. Speakers of Austroasiatic, Tai\u2013Kadai, and Hmong\u2013Mien languages also live in the region.\nRegions of the East Indies are sometimes known by the colonial empire they once belonged to, hence, \"Spanish East Indies\" means the Philippines, \"Dutch East Indies\" means Indonesia, and \"British East Indies\" refers to Malaysia.\nHistorically, the king of Abyssinia (modern Ethiopia) was identified with \"Prester John of the Indies\", since that part of the world was imagined to be one of \"Three Indias\".\nHistory.\nExploration of the \"East Indies\" by European powers began in the last three years of the 15th century and continued into the 16th century, led by the Portuguese explorers. The Portuguese described the entire region they discovered as the \"Indies\". Eventually, the region would be broken up into a series of \"Indies\": The East Indies, which was also called \"Old Indies\" or \"Great Indies\", consisting of India, and the West Indies, also called \"New Indies\" or \"Little Indies\", consisting of the Americas.\nThese regions were important sources of trading goods, particularly cotton, indigo and spices after the establishment of European trading companies: the British East India Company and Dutch East India Company, among others, in the 17th century.\nThe New World was initially thought to be the easternmost part of the \"Indies\" by explorer Christopher Columbus, who had grossly underestimated the westerly distance from Europe to Asia. Later, to avoid confusion, the New World came to be called the \"West Indies\", while the original Indies came to be called the \"East Indies\".\nThe designation \"East Indian\" was once primarily used to describe people of all of the East Indies, in order to avoid the potential confusion from the term American Indian who were once simply referred to as \"Indians\" (see the Native American name controversy for more information).\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "76492", "revid": "1320101801", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=76492", "title": "IBM 704", "text": "Vacuum-tube computer system (1954)\nThe IBM 704 is the model name of a large digital mainframe computer introduced by IBM in 1954. Designed by John Backus and Gene Amdahl, it was the first mass-produced computer with hardware for floating-point arithmetic. The IBM 704 \"Manual of operation\" states: \nThe IBM 704 Electronic Data-Processing Machine is a large-scale, high-speed electronic calculator controlled by an internally stored program of the single address type.\nThe 704 at that time was thus regarded as \"pretty much the only computer that could handle complex math\". The 704 was a significant improvement over the earlier IBM\u00a0701 in terms of architecture and implementation. Like the 701, the 704 used vacuum-tube logic circuitry, but increased the instruction size from 18 bits to 36 bits, the same as the memory's word size. Changes from the 701 include the use of magnetic-core memory instead of Williams tubes, floating-point arithmetic instructions, 15-bit addressing and the addition of three index registers. To support these new features, the instructions were expanded to use the full 36-bit word. The new instruction set, which is not compatible with the 701, became the base for the \"scientific architecture\" subclass of the IBM 700/7000 series computers.\nThe 704 could execute up to 12,000 floating-point additions per second. IBM produced 123 type 704 systems between 1955 and 1960.\nLandmarks.\nThe programming languages FORTRAN and LISP were first developed for the 704, as was the SAP assembler\u2014\"Symbolic Assembly Program\", later distributed by SHARE as \"SHARE Assembly Program\".\nMUSIC, the first computer music program, was developed on the IBM\u00a0704 by Max Mathews.\nIn 1962, physicist John Larry Kelly, Jr. created one of the most famous moments in the history of Bell Labs by using an IBM\u00a0704 computer to synthesize speech. Kelly's voice recorder synthesizer \"vocoder\" recreated the song \"Daisy Bell\", with musical accompaniment from Max Mathews. Arthur C.\u00a0Clarke was coincidentally visiting friend and colleague John Pierce at the Bell Labs Murray Hill facility at the time of this speech synthesis demonstration, and Clarke was so impressed that six years later he used it in the climactic scene of his novel and screenplay for \"\", where the \"HAL\u00a09000\" computer sings the same song. (Bell Laboratories later released a recording, on ten-inch 78-RPM records, of speech and music created this way. It was apparently made with an IBM 7090, the solid-state successor to the 704.)\nEdward O. Thorp, a math instructor at MIT, used the IBM\u00a0704 as a research tool to investigate the probabilities of winning while developing his blackjack gaming theory. He used FORTRAN to formulate the equations of his research model.\nThe IBM 704 at the MIT Computation Center was used as the official tracker for the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory Operation Moonwatch in the fall of 1957. IBM provided four staff scientists to aid Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory scientists and mathematicians in the calculation of satellite orbits: Dr.\u00a0 Giampiero Rossoni, Dr.\u00a0John Greenstadt, Thomas Apple and Richard Hatch. The machine was also an important tool for Frank Rosenblatt; in 1957 he invented the first artificial neural network, the Perceptron, and implemented it on the IBM 704 computer at Cornell Aeronautical Laboratory.\nThe IBM 704 was used for flight dynamics analyses of the NRL's Vanguard rockets. \nThe Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory (LASL) developed an early monitor named \"SLAM\" to enable batch processing.\nRegisters.\nThe IBM 704 had a 38-bit accumulator, a 36-bit multiplier/quotient register, and three 15-bit index registers. The contents of the index registers are subtracted from the base address, so the index registers are also called \"decrement registers\". All three index registers can participate in an instruction: the 3-bit \"tag\" field in the instruction is a bit map specifying which of the registers participate in the operation. However, when more than one index register is selected, then their contents are bit-wise ORed \u2013 not added \u2013 together before the decrement takes place. This behavior persisted in later scientific-architecture machines (such as the IBM\u00a0709 and IBM\u00a07090) until the IBM\u00a07094. The IBM\u00a07094, introduced in 1962, increased the number of index registers to seven and only selected one at a time; the \"or\" behavior remained available in a compatibility mode of the IBM\u00a07094.\nInstruction and data formats.\nThere are two instruction formats, referred to as \"Type\u00a0A\" and \"Type\u00a0B\". Most instructions were of type\u00a0B.\nType A instructions have, in sequence, a 3-bit \"prefix\" (instruction code), a 15-bit \"decrement\" field, a 3-bit \"tag\" field, and a 15-bit \"address\" field. There are conditional jump operations based on the values in the index registers specified in the \"tag\" field. Some instructions also subtract the \"decrement\" field from the contents of the index registers. The implementation requires that the second two bits of the instruction code be non-zero, giving a total of six possible type\u00a0A instructions. One (STR, instruction code binary 101) was not implemented until the IBM\u00a0709.\nType B instructions have, in sequence, a 12-bit instruction code (with bits 2 and 3 set to 0 to distinguish them from type\u00a0A instructions), a 2-bit \"flag\" field, four unused bits, a 3-bit \"tag\" field, and a 15-bit \"address\" field.\nThe instruction set implicitly subdivides the data format into the same fields as type\u00a0A instructions: prefix, decrement, tag and address. Instructions exist to modify each of these fields in a data word without changing the remainder of the word, though the \"Store Tag\" instruction was not implemented on the IBM\u00a0704.\nThe original implementation of Lisp uses the \"address\" and \"decrement\" fields to store the head and tail of a linked list respectively. The primitive functions \"car\" (\"contents of the address part of register\") and \"cdr\" (\"contents of the decrement part of register\") were named after these fields.\nMemory and peripherals.\nControls are included in the 704 for: one 711 Punched Card Reader, one 716 Alphabetic Printer, one 721 Punched Card Recorder, five 727 Magnetic Tape Units and one 753 Tape Control Unit, one 733 Magnetic Drum Reader and Recorder, and one 737 Magnetic Core Storage Unit. Total weight was about .\nThe 704 itself came with a control console having 36 assorted control switches or buttons and 36 data-input switches, one for each bit in a register. The control console essentially allows only setting the binary values of the registers with switches and seeing the binary state of the registers displayed in the pattern of many small neon lamps, appearing much like modern LEDs. For human interaction with the computer, programs would be entered on punched cards initially rather than at the console, and human-readable output would be directed to the printer. \nThe IBM 740 Cathode Ray Tube Output Recorder was also available, which is a 21-inch vector display with a very long phosphor persistence time of 20\u00a0seconds for human viewing, together with a 7-inch display receiving the same signal as the larger display but with a fast-decaying phosphor designed to be photographed with an attached camera. \nThe 737 Magnetic Core Storage Unit serves as RAM and provides 4,096 36-bit words, the equivalent of 18,432\u00a0bytes. The 727 Magnetic Tape Units store over 5\u00a0million 6-bit characters per reel.\nReliability.\nThe IBM\u00a0704 was much more reliable than its predecessor, the IBM\u00a0701, which had a mean time between failure of around 30 minutes. Being a vacuum-tube machine, however, the IBM\u00a0704 had very poor reliability by today's standards. On average, the machine failed around every 8\u00a0hours, comparable to the Manchester Mark 1 in 1949. This limited the program size that the first Fortran compilers could successfully translate because the machine would fail before a successful compilation of a large program.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He had a 70-year career in European and American cinema, television, and theatre, appearing in more than 150 films and several television series in multiple languages. Capable in roles ranging from stolid, contemplative protagonists to sardonic artists and menacing, often gleeful villains, von Sydow received numerous accolades including honors from the Cannes Film Festival and the Venice Film Festival. He was nominated for two\u00a0Academy Awards: for\u00a0Best Actor\u00a0for \"Pelle the Conqueror\" (1987) and for Best Supporting Actor for \"Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close\" (2011).\nVon Sydow was first noticed internationally for playing the 14th-century knight Antonius Block in Ingmar Bergman's \"The Seventh Seal\" (1957), which features iconic scenes of his character challenging Death to a game of chess. He appeared in eleven films directed by Bergman, including \"Wild Strawberries\" (1957), \"The Virgin Spring\" (1960), \"Through a Glass Darkly\" (1961), \"Winter Light\" (1963), \"Shame\" (1968), and \"The Touch\" (1971).\nVon Sydow made his American film debut as Jesus Christ in the Biblical epic film \"The Greatest Story Ever Told\" (1965) and went on to star in films such as \"Hawaii\" (1966), \"The Exorcist\" (1973), \"Three Days of the Condor\" (1975), \"Flash Gordon\" (1980), \"Conan the Barbarian\" (1982) and the James Bond adaptation \"Never Say Never Again\" (1983). He also appeared in supporting roles in \"Dune\" (1984), \"Hannah and Her Sisters\" (1986), \"Awakenings\" (1990), \"Minority Report\" (2002), \"The Diving Bell and the Butterfly\" (2007), \"Shutter Island\" (2010), \"Robin Hood\" (2010), and \"\" (2015). He portrayed the main antagonist Leland Gaunt (The Devil) in the film adaptation of Stephen King's \"Needful Things\" (1993). In 2016, he portrayed the Three-eyed Raven in the HBO fantasy series \"Game of Thrones\", for which he was nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Drama Series.\nVon Sydow received the Royal Foundation of Sweden's Cultural Award in 1954, was made a Commandeur des Arts et des Lettres in 2005, and was named a Chevalier de la L\u00e9gion d'honneur on 17 October 2012.\nEarly life.\nCarl Adolf von Sydow was born on 10 April 1929 in Lund, Sweden. His father, Carl Wilhelm von Sydow, was an ethnologist and professor of folkloristics at Lund University. His mother, Baroness Maria Margareta Rappe, was a schoolteacher. Sydow was of part-German ancestry. A paternal ancestor, David Sydow (\"von\" or \"Von\" was added later to the family name), emigrated from Pomerania to the Kalmar region in 1724. His mother was also of part-Pomeranian descent. Sydow was raised as a Lutheran, but became an agnostic in the 1970s.\nSydow attended Lund Cathedral School, where he learned English at an early age. Originally expected to pursue a career in law, he became interested in acting after seeing a production of \"A Midsummer Night's Dream\" during a class trip to Malm\u00f6, which prompted him to establish an amateur theatrical group along with his friends back at school.\nSydow served for two years in the Swedish Army with the Army Quartermaster Corps, where he adopted the name \"Max\" from the star performer of a flea circus he saw. After completing his service, Sydow studied at the Royal Dramatic Theatre in Stockholm where he trained between 1948 and 1951. During his time at the Royal Dramatic Theatre, he helped start a theatre group, of which actress Ingrid Thulin was a member. He made his stage debut in a small part in the Goethe play \"Egmont\", which he considered \"almost a disaster,\" but received good reviews for his performance.\nCareer.\nEarly career.\nWhile at the Royal Dramatic Theatre, Sydow made his screen debuts in Alf Sj\u00f6berg's films \"Only a Mother\" (', 1949) and \"Miss Julie\" (', 1951). In 1951, Sydow joined the Norrk\u00f6ping-Link\u00f6ping Municipal Theatre, appearing in nine plays including \"Peer Gynt\". In 1953, he moved on to the City Theatre in H\u00e4lsingborg (Helsingborg), playing eleven parts in a two-year stint, including Prospero in \"The Tempest\" and the title role of the Pirandello play \"Henry IV\". Sydow's theatrical work won him critical recognition, and in 1954 he received the Royal Foundation of Sweden's Cultural Award, a grant to young, promising actors.\n1955\u20131960s.\nIn 1955, Sydow moved to Malm\u00f6 and joined the Malm\u00f6 City Theatre, whose chief director at the time was Ingmar Bergman. Sydow had previously sought to play a small part in Bergman's \"Prison\" (', 1949), but the director rejected the proposition. Bergman and Sydow's first film was \"The Seventh Seal\" (', 1957), in which Sydow portrayed Antonius Block, a disillusioned 14th-century knight returning from the Crusades to a plague-stricken Sweden. The scene of his character playing a game of chess with Death has come to be regarded as an iconic moment in cinema. Sydow went on to appear in a total of 11 Bergman films. In \"The Magician\" (', 1958), Sydow starred as Vogler, a 19th-century traveling illusionist who remains silent for most of the film. In \"The Virgin Spring\" (', 1960), he played a medieval landowner who takes vengeance on the men who raped and murdered his daughter. In \"Through a Glass Darkly\" (', 1961), he portrayed the husband of a schizophrenic woman, played by Harriet Andersson. During this period, he also had roles in films including \"Wild Strawberries\" (', 1957), \"Brink of Life\" (', 1958) and \"Winter Light\" (', 1963). Films starring Sydow were submitted by Sweden for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film in five out of six years between 1957 and 1962. Under Bergman, Sydow also continued his stage career, playing Brick in \"Cat on a Hot Tin Roof\", Peer in \"Peer Gynt\", Alceste in \"The Misanthrope\" and Faust in \"Urfaust\". In his company were Gunnar Bj\u00f6rnstrand, Ingrid Thulin, Bibi Andersson and Gunnel Lindblom, all frequent collaborators of Bergman on screen.\nDespite his rising profile, Sydow limited his work exclusively to Sweden early in his career, constantly refusing offers to work outside the country. He was first approached at the 1959 Cannes Film Festival to act in U.S. films, but refused the proposition, saying that he was \"content in Sweden\" and \"had no intention of starting an international career\". He also refused the opportunity to play the title role for \"Dr. No\" (1962) and Captain von Trapp in \"The Sound of Music\" (1965). In 1965, Sydow finally accepted George Stevens's offer and made his international debut, playing Christ in the epic \"The Greatest Story Ever Told\". He accepted the part against the advice of Bergman, spent six months at the University of California, Los Angeles, preparing for the role, and adopted a Mid-Atlantic accent. The film introduced Sydow to a wider audience, but ultimately performed below expectations at the box office. He went on to play a crop-dusting pilot in \"The Reward\" (1965) and a fanatic missionary in \"Hawaii\" (1966). For his performance in \"Hawaii\", Sydow received his first Golden Globe nomination. To his own frustration, however, Sydow would become frequently cast in villainous roles, such as a neo-Nazi aristocrat in \"The Quiller Memorandum\" (1966), a Russian colonel in \"The Kremlin Letter\" (1970), a meticulous and elegant international assassin in \"Three Days of the Condor\" (1975), Emperor Ming the Merciless in \"Flash Gordon\" (1980) and James Bond's nemesis Ernst Stavro Blofeld in \"Never Say Never Again\" (1983).\nIn the late 1960s and early 1970s, Sydow was often paired with Liv Ullmann in Bergman films. In 1968's \"Hour of the Wolf\" ('), Sydow played an artist living on an isolated island with his pregnant wife, played by Ullmann. In the same year, the two appeared in the drama \"Shame\" ('), about a couple (both former musicians) living on a farm on an island during a war. Sydow and Ullmann returned for the 1969 Bergman film \"The Passion of Anna\" ('). In 1971 and 1972, Sydow again starred alongside Ullmann in the Jan Troell epic duology, \"The Emigrants\" (') \"The New Land\" (\"\"), the story of a Swedish peasant family that emigrates to America in the mid-19th century.\n1970s\u20131980s.\nIn 1971, Sydow starred in \"The Touch\", Bergman's first English-language film, playing a doctor whose wife is having an affair. In 1973, Sydow appeared in one of his most commercially successful films, William Friedkin's \"The Exorcist\" (1973). He played Father Lankester Merrin, the film's titular Jesuit priest, which earned him his second Golden Globe nomination. He reprised the role in the film's sequel, \"\" (1977). In 1977, Sydow made his Broadway debut alongside Eileen Atkins and Bibi Andersson in Per Olov Enquist's \"The Night of the Tribades\", a play about the writer August Strindberg. In 1981, he starred with Anne Bancroft in the Tom Kempinski play \"Duet for One\" about the cellist Jacqueline du Pr\u00e9. Sydow made his British stage debut at The Old Vic in 1988 as Prospero in \"The Tempest\", a role he had first played in Sweden three decades before.\nIn the 1980s, in addition to \"Flash Gordon\" and \"Never Say Never Again\", Sydow appeared in John Milius's \"Conan the Barbarian\" (1982), Jan Troell's \"Flight of the Eagle\" (1982), Rick Moranis's &amp; Dave Thomas's \"Strange Brew\" (1983), David Lynch's \"Dune\" (1984) and Woody Allen's \"Hannah and Her Sisters\" (1986). In 1985, Sydow was a member of the jury at the 35th Berlin International Film Festival. In the 1987 Bille August film \"Pelle the Conqueror\", Sydow portrayed an impoverished Swedish labourer who brought his son to Denmark to try to build a better life for themselves. The role won him international acclaim and is often considered one of the best roles in his career. For his performance, Sydow received a Best Actor nomination at the 61st Academy Awards; the film won Best Foreign Language Film as Denmark's official Oscar entry. \nIn 1988, Sydow made his only directorial foray with \"Katinka\", a film based on the Herman Bang novel, \"Ved Vejen\". The film won the Guldbagge Awards for Best Film and Best Director but was not widely seen outside Sweden. In 1989, Sydow appeared in the television film \"Red King, White Knight\", for which he received his first Primetime Emmy Award nomination. He also supplied the voice for Vigo the Carpathian in the 1989 film, \"Ghostbusters II\".\n1990s\u20132000s.\nSydow and Bergman did not work together for an extended period. A part in Bergman's \"Fanny and Alexander\" (1982) was specifically written for Sydow, but his agent demanded too large a salary. Sydow came to regret missing out on the role. The two did eventually reunite in 1991 with \"The Best Intentions\", directed by Bille August with a script from Bergman. In 1996, Sydow made his final appearance in a Bergman film, \"Private Confessions\", directed by Liv Ullmann and written by Bergman. In 1997, Sydow played Nobel Prize-winning Norwegian novelist and Nazi sympathizer Knut Hamsun in the biopic \"Hamsun\". Throughout the rest of the 1990s, Sydow also appeared in films such as \"Father\" (1990), \"Awakenings\" (1990), \"Until the End of the World\" (1991), \"Needful Things\" (1993), \"Judge Dredd\" (1995) and \"Snow Falling on Cedars\" (1999). For his performance in \"Father\", Sydow won the Australian Film Institute Best Actor Award.\nIn 2002, Sydow acted in one of his biggest commercial successes, playing the PreCrime director opposite Tom Cruise in Steven Spielberg's science fiction thriller \"Minority Report\". In 2004, Sydow appeared in a television adaptation of the \"Ring of the Nibelung\" saga. The show set ratings records and was later released in the United States as \"\". In 2007, he starred in the box-office hit \"Rush Hour 3\" as one of the antagonists opposite Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker, and played the father of the protagonist in \"The Diving Bell and the Butterfly\", Julian Schnabel's adaptation of the memoir by Jean-Dominique Bauby. In 2009, Sydow appeared in the drama series \"The Tudors\".\n2010s.\nIn 2010, Sydow played a sinister German doctor in Martin Scorsese's \"Shutter Island\", and Robin Hood's blind stepfather Sir Walter Loxley in Ridley Scott's \"Robin Hood\". He received his second Academy Award nomination for his performance as a mute elderly renter in Stephen Daldry's \"Extremely Loud &amp; Incredibly Close\" (2011), based on the novel by Jonathan Safran Foer.\nIn April 2013, Sydow was honored at the Turner Classic Movie (TCM) Festival in Hollywood, with screenings of two of his classic films, \"Three Days of the Condor\" and \"The Seventh Seal\".\nIn March 2014, Sydow provided the voice of an art forger named in \"The War of Art\" episode of \"The Simpsons\".\nIn 2015, he played the explorer Lor San Tekka in \"\". In 2016, he joined the HBO series \"Game of Thrones\" as the Three-eyed Raven. For his performance, Sydow received his second Primetime Emmy Award nomination.\nIn addition to his film and television work, Sydow also made forays into video games. He voiced Esbern, a mentor of the protagonist in ' (2011), and narrated the game's debut trailer. He also lent his voice to the 2009 game ' and reprised his role as Lor San Tekka in \"\" (2016).\nIn 2018, Sydow appeared in Thomas Vinterberg's film \"Kursk\", also known as \"The Command\", based on the true story of the Kursk submarine disaster.\nHis final role was in Nicholas Dimitropoulos's war drama \"Echoes of the Past\" (2021). He portrayed Nicolas Andreou, one of the last living survivors of the Kalavryta massacre of 1943 committed by Nazi troops during the Axis occupation of Greece.\nPersonal life.\nMax von Sydow married actress Christina Inga Britta Olin in 1951. They had two sons. The couple divorced in 1979. Von Sydow married French documentarian Catherine Brelet in 1997 and adopted Brelet's two adult sons from her previous marriage.\nSydow relocated to Paris following his marriage to Brelet. In 2002, he became a citizen of France, at which time he had to relinquish his Swedish citizenship.\nSydow was reported to be either an agnostic or an atheist. In 2012, he told Charlie Rose in an interview that Ingmar Bergman had told him he would contact him after death to show him that there was a life after death. When Rose asked Sydow if he had heard from Bergman, he replied that he had but chose not to elaborate further on the exact meaning of this statement. In the same interview, he described himself as a doubter in his youth but stated this doubt was gone and indicated he came to agree with Bergman's belief in the afterlife.\nDeath.\nMax von Sydow died on 8 March 2020 at his home in Provence, France, at age 90.\nAwards and nominations.\nHe was nominated for two Academy Awards, for his performances in Bille August's \"Pelle the Conqueror\" (1987) and Stephen Daldry's \"Extremely Loud &amp; Incredibly Close\" (2011). At the age of 82, von Sydow was one of the oldest Oscar acting nominees. He also received two Golden Globe Awards nominations as well as two Primetime Emmy Awards nominations. In 1982 he received the Best Actor prize at the Venice International Film Festival for his performance in \"Flight of the Eagle\". He was also the winner of 3 Guldbagge Awards and received a festival trophy from the Cannes Film Festival in 2004.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\n "}

She is probably best known for her murder mysteries, both historical and modern, and especially for her medieval detective series The Cadfael Chronicles.\nPersonal.\nPargeter was born in the village of Horsehay (Shropshire, England), daughter of Edmund Valentine Pargeter (known as Ted) and his wife Edith \"nee\" Hordley. Her father was a clerk at the local Horsehay Company ironworks. She later moved with her parents to Dawley where she was educated at Dawley Church of England School and the old Coalbrookdale High School for Girls. She had Welsh ancestry, and many of her short stories and books (both fiction and non-fiction) are set in Wales and its borderlands, or have Welsh protagonists.\nAfter leaving school she worked as a temporary labour exchange clerk, then as an assistant at a chemist's shop in Dawley, during which time her first novel, \"Hortensius, Friend of Nero\", was published in 1936. During World War II, she enlisted in the Women's Royal Naval Service (the \"Wrens\") in 1940. She worked in an administrative role as a teleprinter operator at Devonport, and then at the Western Approaches Headquarters at Derby House, Liverpool. She reached the rank of petty officer by 1 January 1944 when she was awarded the British Empire Medal (BEM) in the New Year Honours.\nIn 1947 Pargeter visited Czechoslovakia in a Workers' Educational Association party and became fascinated by the Czech language and culture. She wrote two books about then-Czechoslovakia: \"The Fair Young Phoenix\" and \"The Coast of Bohemia\". She became fluent in Czech and published award-winning translations of Czech poetry and prose into English. She translated books by Jan Neruda, Bo\u017eena N\u011bmcov\u00e1, and Karel Hynek M\u00e1cha, as well as books by 20th-century writers such as Bohumil Hrabal, Ivan Kl\u00edma, Ladislav Van\u010dura, and Nobel Prize Laureate in Literature, the poet Jaroslav Seifert.\nShe was an active Labour Party supporter until, with her brother Ellis Pargeter (a local councillor in Dawley), she left the party in 1949 because they believed that it had deserted socialist principles.\nWriting career.\nShe devoted the rest of her life to writing, both nonfiction and well-researched fiction. She never attended university but became a self-taught scholar in areas that interested her, especially Shropshire and Wales. Birmingham University gave her an honorary master's degree. She never married, but did fall in love with a Czech man. She remained friends with him after he married another woman. She was pleased that she could support herself with her writing from the time after the Second World War until her death.\nPargeter wrote under a number of pseudonyms; it was under the name Ellis Peters that she wrote her later crime stories, especially the highly popular series of Brother Cadfael medieval mysteries, featuring a Benedictine monk at the Abbey in Shrewsbury. That pseudonym was drawn from the name of her brother, Ellis, and a version of the name of the daughter of friends, Petra. Many of the novels were made into films for television. Although she won her first award for a novel written in 1963, her greatest fame and sales came with the \"Cadfael Chronicles\", which began in 1977. At the time that the 19th novel was published, sales of the series exceeded 6.5 million. The \"Cadfael Chronicles\" drew international attention to Shrewsbury and its history, and greatly increased tourism to the town. In an interview in 1993, she mentioned her own work before the Second World War as a chemist's assistant, where they prepared many of the compounds they sold. \"We used to make bottled medicine that we compounded specially, with ingredients like gentian, rosemary, horehound. You never see that nowadays; those tinctures are never prescribed. They often had bitters of some sort in them, a taste I rather liked. Some of Cadfael's prescriptions come out of those years.\"\nHer Cadfael novels show great appreciation for the ideals of medieval Catholic Christianity, but also a recognition of its weaknesses, such as quarrels over the finer points of theology (\"The Heretic's Apprentice\"), and the desire of the church to own more and more land and wealth (\"Monk's Hood\", \"Saint Peter's Fair\", \"The Rose Rent\").\nLater life.\nIn 1992 her mobility began to decline after a fall during a service being televised for \"Songs of Praise\" at Shrewsbury Abbey. She had a further fall in 1994 at home that led to the amputation of a leg at Princess Royal Hospital, Telford.\nShe died at her last home in Glendinning Way, Madeley, Shropshire, in October 1995 at the age of 82, having recently returned home from hospital following a stroke. On 14 September 1997, a new stained glass window depicting St Benedict was installed in Shrewsbury Abbey and was dedicated to the memory of Edith Pargeter, with funds raised by donations from admirers of the author.\nShe is remembered in her home town with a residential road named after her. Ellis Peters Drive sits off Southall Road between Aqueduct and Brookside in Telford.\nRecognition.\nThe Mystery Writers of America gave Pargeter their Edgar Award in 1963 for \"Death and the Joyful Woman\". In 1980, the British Crime Writers' Association awarded her the Silver Dagger for \"Monk's Hood\". In 1993 she won the Cartier Diamond Dagger, an annual award given by the CWA to authors who have made an outstanding lifetime contribution to the field of crime and mystery writing. Pargeter was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) \"for services to Literature\" in the 1994 New Year Honours. To commemorate Pargeter's life and work, in 1999 the CWA established their Ellis Peters Historical Dagger award (later called the Ellis Peters Historical Award) for the best historical crime novel of the year.\nPargeter's \"Cadfael Chronicles\" are often credited for popularizing what would later become known as the historical mystery.\nBibliography.\nAs Edith Pargeter.\nThe Brothers of Gwynedd Quartet.\n4 novels about Llewelyn the Last:\nExplanatory notes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The firth (a Scottish term for an inlet of the sea) divides Cumbria (including the Solway Plain) from Dumfries and Galloway. The Isle of Man is also very near to the firth. The firth comprises part of the Irish Sea.\nThe firth's coastline is characterised by lowland hills and small mountains. It is a mainly rural area, with mostly small villages and settlements (such as Powfoot). Fishing, hill farming, and some arable farming play a large part in the local economy, although tourism is increasing.\nThe northern part of the English coast of the Solway Firth was designated as an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, known as the Solway Coast, in 1964. Construction of the Robin Rigg Wind Farm in the firth began in 2007.\nWithin the firth, there are some salt marshes and mud flats that can be dangerous, due to their frequently shifting patches of quicksand.\nWildlife.\nThere are over of Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSIs) in the area of the firth (one of which is Salta Moss), as well as national nature reserves \u2014 at Caerlaverock and in Cumbria. On the Cumbrian side, much of the coastline has been designated an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB). The Solway Coast\u2019s AONB has two separate sections: the first runs westward from just north of Carlisle to Skinburness; the second runs south from the hamlet of Beckfoot, past Mawbray and Allonby, to Crosscanonby.\nIn 2013, the honeycomb worm and blue mussel were designated as targets of conservation efforts, and Allonby Bay (an inlet of the Solway Firth) was put forward as a candidate for a Marine Conservation Zone.\nLong-distance walking route.\nA long-distance walking route, the Annandale Way, runs through Annandale, from the source of the River Annan, in the Moffat Hills, to the Solway Firth; it was opened in September 2009.\nIslands in the Solway.\nUnlike other parts of the west coast of Scotland, the Solway Firth has only a few islands. They are:\nRivers.\nThe Solway Firth is the estuary of the River Eden and the River Esk.\nBelow are links to lists of the other rivers that flow into the firth:\nHistory.\nThe name \"Solway\" (recorded as \"Sulewad\" in 1218) is of Scandinavian origin, and was originally the name of a ford across the mud flats at Eskmouth. The first element of the name is probably from the Old Norse word 'pillar', referring to the Lochmaben Stane, though it may instead be from , meaning 'solan goose'. and both have long vowels, but the early spellings of Solway indicate a short vowel in the first element. This may be due to the shortening of an originally long vowel in the Middle English period but may also represent an original short vowel. If this is the case, the first element may be , an unrecorded word cognate with Old English 'muddy, pool', or a derivative of , meaning 'to swill'.\nThe second element of the name is from the Old Norse , meaning 'ford' (which is cognate with the modern English word \"wade\").\nThe area had three fords: the Annan or Bowness Wath, the Dornock Wath (once called the Sandywathe), and the main one \u2014the Solewath (also called the Solewath or the Sulewad).\nA wooden lighthouse was built in 1841 at Barnkirk Point (grid reference ). It was destroyed by fire in 1960.\nOn 9 March 1876, a 79-ton French lugger \"St. Pierre\", was stranded - and finally declared lost - on Blackshaw Bank, an ill-defined feature which extends for a considerable distance on both sides of the channel of the River Nith.\nBetween 1869 and 1921, the estuary was crossed by the Solway Junction Railway on a 1780\u00a0m (5850\u00a0ft) iron viaduct. The line was built to carry iron ore from the Whitehaven area to Lanarkshire and was financed and operated by the Caledonian Railway of Scotland. After the railway, which was not a financial success, ceased operating in 1921, the railway bridge became a popular footpath, enabling residents of Scotland to easily cross into England, where alcoholic drink was legally available seven days a week. (Scotland was dry on Sundays at the time.) The viaduct was demolished between 1931 and 1933.\nMargaret Wilson was a Scottish Covenanter who was executed by drowning in the Solway Firth in 1685. She was tied to a stake in the water and left to drown with the incoming tide. Margaret Wilson lived during a time of great turmoil in Scotland, with the Covenanter movement opposing the episcopalian governance of the Church of Scotland. The Covenanters sought to maintain their Presbyterian faith and resist the authority of the monarch. \nJohn Everett Millais created an illustration, a wood engraving, depicting the Scottish martyr Margaret Wilson, tied to a stake in the surf at Solway, because, as a Covenanter, refusing to acknowledge James II as head of the church. It was engraved by the workshop of Joseph Swain and published in \"Once a Week\" in 1862. Of further interest is John Everett Millais' painting, ;\"The Knight Errant\" (1870) original section was later sewn into another canvas and exhibited in 1872 as \"The Martyr of The Solway\" (Walker Art Gallery, Liverpool; plate), which is similar to the woodcut noted here.\nThe Ministry of Defence had by 1999 fired more than 6,350 depleted uranium rounds into the Solway Firth from its testing range at Dundrennan Range.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSlipknot 2019 song. \"Solway Firth\" from the Album \"We Are Not Your Kind\""}

It had a population of 245,862 (2004). Matadi is situated on the left bank of the Congo River, from the mouth and below the last navigable point before the rapids that make the river impassable for a long stretch upriver.\nHistory.\nMatadi was near the site of the state of Vungu, which was first mentioned in 1535 and was said to be destroyed in 1624.\nMatadi itself was founded by Sir Henry Morton Stanley in 1879. It was strategically important because it was the last navigable port going upstream on the Congo River; it became the furthest inland port in the Congo Free State. The construction of the Matadi\u2013Kinshasa Railway (built between 1890 and 1898) made it possible to transport goods from deeper within Congo's interior to the port of Matadi, stimulating the city to become an important trading center. Portuguese and French West-African commercial interests influenced the city's architecture and urban design, which borrowed from the neighboring colonies in Angola and the Congo-Brazzaville.\nCulture.\nThe word \"Matadi\" means stone in the local Kikongo language. The town is built on steep hills. A local saying is that to live in Matadi, you must know the verbs \"to go up\", \"to go down\", and \"to sweat\". Upstream is a series of caves known as the \"rock of Diogo C\u00e3o\", after graffiti carved by the Portuguese explorer in 1485 marking the limit of his travels up the Congo River.\nYelala Rapids lies near the city.\nClimate.\nMatadi has a relatively dry tropical savanna climate (K\u00f6ppen \"Aw\") with a lengthy dry season from June to September due to the northerly extension of the cold, foggy Benguela Current.\nInfrastructure.\nThe port of Matadi serves as a major import and export point for the whole nation. Chief exports are coffee and timber. The state fishing company \"Pemarza\" uses the port to supply fish to Kinshasa. Tshimpi Airport is nearby. \nMatadi Bridge, a suspension bridge 722 m- long with a main span of 520 m, built in 1983, crosses the river just south of Matadi, carrying the main road linking Kinshasa to the coast. It is the only bridge over the main stem of the Congo River. After passing through Matadi and over the bridge, it continues to Boma, Muanda and Banana. Although built as a mixed rail and road bridge, no rail line is now operating over the bridge. Matadi is the port railhead for the 366\u00a0km long Matadi-Kinshasa Railway, constructed to bypass the rapids on the river upstream. A monument to the builders of the railway stands on a nearby hill.\nA power station on the M'pozo River supplies power to Matadi.\nPort.\nThe maximum draft of the port is 8.2m. The Navy of the Democratic Republic of the Congo maintains one operational command at the port.\nCurrently, larger ships are required to transfer cargo to smaller vessels in the Republic of Congo's Pointe-Noire port. For this reason, the development of a deep-sea port at Port Banana was begun in 2022.\nMedia.\n\"La Cit\u00e9 africaine de Matadi\" is a newspaper published in French in Matadi.\nIn Belgium, a small garden city in the Heverlee suburb of Leuven was named after Matadi in the 1920s.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Founded in 1910, about 130 million Americans have participated in its programs, which are served by 465,000 adult volunteers. The organization became a founding member of the World Organization of the Scout Movement in 1922. In 2025 the organization changed its name to Scouting America.\nThe stated mission of Scouting America is to \"prepare young people to make ethical and moral choices over their lifetimes by instilling in them the values of the Scout Oath and Law.\" Youth are trained in responsible citizenship, character development, and self-reliance through participation in a wide range of outdoor activities, educational programs, and, at older age levels, career-oriented programs in partnership with community organizations. For younger members, the Scout method is part of the program to instill typical Scouting values such as trustworthiness, good citizenship, and outdoors skills, through a variety of activities such as camping, aquatics, and hiking. To further these outdoor activities, Scouting America owns four high-adventure bases: Northern Tier (Minnesota, Manitoba, and Ontario), Philmont Scout Ranch (New Mexico), Sea Base (Florida Keys, U.S. Virgin Islands, and Bahamas), and Summit Bechtel Reserve (West Virginia), as well as nearly 100 camps and reservations dedicated to scouts.\nThe main Scouting programs are Cub Scouts for ages 5 to 11 years, Scouts BSA for ages 10 to 18, Venturing for ages 14 through 21, and Sea Scouts for ages 14 through 21. Scouting America units are operated by chartering local organizations, such as churches, clubs, civic associations, or educational organizations, to implement the Scouting program for youth within their communities. Units are led by volunteers appointed by the chartering organization (most prominently by the \"Key 3\", made up of the Unit Leader, Committee Chair, and Chartered Organization representative), who are supported by local councils using both paid professional Scouters and volunteers. Additionally, Learning for Life is an affiliate that provides in-school and career education.\nIn 2019, the Boy Scouts of America renamed its flagship program, Boy Scouts, to Scouts BSA to reflect its policy change allowing girls to join separate all-girl troops. On February 8, 2025, its 115th anniversary, the BSA changed its name to Scouting America. The Scout Oath, Law and program remain unchanged.\nOrigins.\nThe progressive movement in the United States was at its height during the early 20th century. With the migration of families from farms to cities, there were concerns among some people that young men were no longer learning patriotism, self-reliance, and individualism. Several groups attempted to fill this void. The YMCA was an early promoter of reforms for young men with a focus on social welfare and programs of mental, physical, social and religious development.72\u201382 Others, included the Woodcraft Indians started by Ernest Thompson Seton in 1902 in Cos Cob, Connecticut, and the Sons of Daniel Boone founded by Daniel Carter Beard in 1905 in Cincinnati, Ohio, two notable independent scouting predecessors of Scouting America within the United States.\nIn 1907, Robert Baden-Powell founded the Scouting movement in England using elements of Seton's works among other influences. In 1909, Chicago publisher W. D. Boyce was visiting London, where he encountered a boy who came to be known as the Unknown Scout. Boyce was lost on a foggy street when an unknown Scout came to his aid, guiding him to his destination. The boy then refused Boyce's tip, explaining that he was a Boy Scout and was merely doing his daily good turn. Interested in the Boy Scouts, Boyce met with staff at the Boy Scouts Headquarters and, by some accounts, Baden-Powell. Upon his return to the US, Boyce was inspired by his experience and incorporated the \"Boy Scouts of America\" on February 8, 1910. Edgar M. Robinson and Lee F. Hanmer became interested in the nascent BSA and convinced Boyce to turn the program over to the YMCA for development in April 1910. Robinson enlisted Seton, Beard, Charles Eastman, and other prominent leaders in the early youth movements. Former president Theodore Roosevelt, who had long complained of the decline in American manhood, became an ardent supporter. In January 1911, Robinson turned the movement over to James E. West who became the first Chief Scout Executive and Scouting began to expand in the US148 Among other programs in the US, the Woodcraft Indians and Sons of Daniel Boone, eventually merged with the BSA.52\nScouting America's stated purpose at its incorporation in 1910 was \"to teach [boys] patriotism, courage, self-reliance, and kindred values.\"7 Later, in 1937, Deputy Chief Scout Executive George J. Fisher expressed the BSA's mission: \"Each generation as it comes to maturity has no more important duty than that of teaching high ideals and proper behavior to the generation which follows.\" The current mission statement of Scouting America is \"to prepare young people to make ethical and moral choices over their lifetimes by instilling in them the values of the Scout Oath and Law.\"\nAt its peak, Scouting America had an active membership of over 4 million youth in 1973. Today, popularity in outdoor events has waned and membership has dropped. However, Scouting America remains the largest scouting organization and one of the largest youth organizations in the United States, with about 1 million youth participants and over 400,000 adult volunteers as of 2024[ [update]].\nFederally chartered corporation.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n The purposes of the corporation are to promote, through organization, and cooperation with other agencies, the ability of boys to do things for themselves and others, to train them in scoutcraft, and to teach them patriotism, courage, self-reliance, and kindred virtues, using the methods that were in common use by boy scouts on June 15, 1916.\n\u00a0https://\nScouting America holds one of the comparatively rare congressional charters under Title 36 of the United States Code. On behalf of Boy Scouts of America, Paul Sleman, Colin H. Livingstone, Ernest S. Martin, and James E. West successfully lobbied Congress for a federal charter, which President Woodrow Wilson signed on June 15, 1916. One of the principal reasons for seeking a congressional charter was to deal with competition from other Scout organizations including the United States Boy Scouts and the Lone Scouts of America. The 1916 statute of incorporation established this institution among a small number of similarly chartered patriotic and national organizations, such as the Girl Scouts, Civil Air Patrol, the American Legion, the Red Cross, Little League Baseball, and the National Academy of Sciences. The federal incorporation was originally construed primarily as an honor; however, it does grant the chartered organization some special privileges and rights, including freedom from antitrust and monopoly regulation and complete control over the organization's symbols and insignia, though it neither implies nor accords Congress any special control over Scouting America, which remains free to function independently.\nMembership.\nMain programs.\nScouting America uses four primary programs to achieve its aims in Scouting:\nThere are about 100,000 physically or mentally disabled Scouts throughout the United States. Anyone certified as disabled \"may enroll in Scouting and remain in its program beyond the regulation age limits. This provision allows all members to advance in Scouting as far as they wish.\"\nOther programs.\nScouting America offers several other programs and subprograms beyond regular membership:\nMembership controversies.\nUnlike Learning for Life, membership in the regular Scouting America programs had been more restricted and controversial. Until the late 2010s, Cub Scouting or the program then-named Boy Scouting was open to boys only, but girls were permitted to join the Venturing, Sea Scouting, and Explorers programs in 1970. Women could also serve as adult volunteers in all programs in approximately the same time frame. On October 11, 2017, Scouting America announced that girls would be allowed to become Cub Scouts, starting in 2018, and be in the Scouts BSA program, starting on February 1, 2019.\nScouting America's religious requirements of its members have been controversial and inconsistent. Many volunteers within the organization have welcomed atheist and agnostic scouts. However, in 2018, the Boy Scouts of America National Executive Board \"reaffirm[ed] its unequivocal commitment to the Declaration of Religious Principle as a fundamental component of the mission of the Boy Scouts of America\". At the same meeting, it also stated that \"[t]he recognition of God as the ruling and leading power in the universe and the grateful acknowledgement of His favors and blessings are necessary to the best type of citizenship and are wholesome precepts in the education of the growing members\". This position is inconsistent with the fact that the BSA has had Buddhist troops since 1920, although Buddhism is a nontheistic religion which does not assert belief in a creator God. The BSA also signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the Unitarian Universalist Association in 2016 which specifically gives ultimate authority over a participant's spiritual welfare to the individual Unitarian Universalist congregation. The MOU also specifically includes within Unitarian Universalist chartered troops humanism as an acceptable form of spirituality as well as Earth-centered religions.\nIn 2000, the Supreme Court ruled in \"Boy Scouts of America v. Dale\" that Boy Scouts and all similar, private voluntary organizations have the constitutionally protected right under the First Amendment of freedom of association to set membership standards. In 2004, the BSA adopted a new policy statement, including a \"Youth Leadership\" policy that disallowed members to continue in leadership positions if they held themselves as \"open and avowed homosexuals\".\nAt the Scouts annual meeting in April 2012, a leader from the Northeast presented a resolution that \"would allow individual units to accept gays as adult leaders\". However, in July 2012, at the culmination of a review started in 2010, an 11-person committee convened by the BSA reached a \"unanimous consensus\" recommending retaining the gay-exclusion policy. Intel, UPS, and Merck cut financial ties with Scouting America over this decision. Within the BSA National Executive Board, members James Turley, CEO of Ernst &amp; Young, and Randall Stephenson, CEO of AT&amp;T and who was then \"on track to become president of the Scout's national board in 2014\", and later did become president, publicly opposed the policy and stated their intention \"to work from within the BSA Board to actively encourage dialogue and sustainable progress\" in changing the policy. On January 28, 2013, the BSA announced it was considering rescinding the ban on homosexuals, allowing chartered organizations to determine local policy.\nOn May 23, 2013, over 60% of the 1,400-member BSA National Council voted to remove the restriction denying membership to youth on the basis of sexual orientation while emphasizing that any sexual conduct, whether heterosexual or homosexual, is not allowed. The resolution went into effect on January 1, 2014, but Scout leaders who were \"open and avowed homosexuals\" were still prohibited. The policy specifically states that BSA does not inquire into a person's sexuality. Gay rights groups hailed the decision, but vowed to press on until all gay members were accepted. Some churches and conservative members threatened to quit the Boy Scouts in response. On June 12, 2013, the Southern Baptist Convention passed non-binding resolutions urging the BSA not to change their policy. In September 2013, a new scouting group called Trail Life USA was created, in support of what founders call \"traditional, Christian\" scouting. Subsequently, some Christian denomination congregations replaced their Boy Scouts of America troops with those of Trail Life USA.\nIn May 2015, Boy Scouts of America President Robert Gates said it was time to end the ban on gay leaders. Gates said it \"cannot be sustained\" any longer. On July 10, 2015, the Boy Scouts of America Executive Committee agreed, and referred the matter to the National Executive Board. On July 27, 2015, the Boy Scouts of America National Executive Board voted to lift the organization's blanket ban on openly gay leaders and employees. Local chartering organizations are still permitted to set their own standards based on religious principle for selecting the adult volunteers for their unit.\nOn January 30, 2017, the Boy Scouts of America announced that transgender children who identify as boys would be allowed to enroll in boys-only programs, effective immediately. Previously, the sex listed on an applicant's birth certificate determined eligibility for these programs; going forward, the decision would be based on the gender listed on the application. Joe Maldonado became the first openly transgender child identifying as a boy to join the Scouts on February 7, 2017. He had been rejected from the Boy Scouts in 2016 for being transgender, but the policy was changed after his story became nationally known.\nOn October 11, 2017, the Boy Scouts of America announced that girls would be welcomed into Cub Scouts beginning in late 2018, with an early adopter program beginning on January 15, 2018, in councils that wished to participate early. The announcement included the statement that girls in Cub Scouting will simply be called \"Cub Scouts\". The flagship program of Boy Scouts of America, previously known as \"Boy Scouting\", became known as Scouts BSA on February 1, 2019, when the program opened to girls. Members of Scouts BSA are known as \"Scouts\". On November 6, 2018, the Girl Scouts organization filed a federal trademark lawsuit seeking to block the BSA from rebranding itself simply as \"Scouts\"; the two organizations had previously litigated the use of the term \"scout\".\nOn May 7, 2024, the BSA announced that it would change its name to Scouting America. The name change officially went into effect on February 8, 2025, the 115th anniversary of the organization. The Scout Oath, Law and program remain unchanged. The uniforms also remain the same but are embroidered with the new name. The change does not affect the name of their flagship \"program\", \"Scouts BSA\" which was renamed from \"Boy Scouts\" in 2019.\nProgram.\nAims, methods, and ideals.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n\"On my honor, I will do my best, to do my duty, to God and my country, and to obey the Scout Law, to help other people at all times, to keep myself physically strong, mentally awake, and morally straight.\" -Scout Oath\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n\"A Scout is trustworthy, loyal, helpful, friendly, courteous, kind, obedient, cheerful, thrifty, brave, clean, and reverent.\" -Scout Law\nThe objectives of Scouting America are referred to as the Aims and Methods of Scouting: Character, Citizenship, Personal Fitness, Leadership. Scouting America pursues these aims through an informal education system called the Scout method, with variations that are designed to be appropriate for the age and maturity of each membership division.\nCub Scouts wear a uniform that gives each Scout a level of identity within the den, the pack and the community. The Scouts learn teamwork by meeting and working together in a den of four to ten boys or girls under adult leadership. They learn and apply the ideals codified in the Scout Oath and the Scout Law through an advancement system using age-based ranks earned by completing required and elective adventures. Some advancement is done in the home and is intended to involve the entire family and many Cub Scout activities include family members.\nIn the Scouts BSA program, Scouts learn to use the ideals spelled out in the Scout Oath, the Scout Law, the Outdoor Code, the Scout motto (\"Be prepared\"), and the Scout slogan (\"Do a good turn daily\"). They wear a uniform and work together in patrols of four to ten Scouts with an elected patrol leader, who then appoints an assistant patrol leader. Scouts share responsibilities, apply skills learned at meetings and live together in the outdoors. The advancement system provides opportunities for personal growth and self-reliance. Scouts interact with adult leaders who act as role models and mentors, but they are expected to plan their own activities within the troop and to participate in community service.\nVenturers are expected to know and live by the Scout Oath and Law. Before May 2014, members of the Venturing program followed the now discontinued Venturing Oath and Venturing Code. Venturers associate and work directly with adult advisors, but the crew is led by elected youth officers who are given opportunities to learn and apply leadership skills. Venturers plan and participate in interdependent group experiences dependent on cooperation. An emphasis on high adventure provides opportunities for team-building and practical leadership applications. A series of awards provide opportunities for recognition and personal growth. Each award requires the Venturer to teach what they have learned to others, thereby returning the skill and knowledge back to the community and enabling the Venturer to master those skills.\nIn October 2012, the National Council announced that, as a result of the findings and recommendations of a select committee made up of volunteer Scouters, the Cub Scout and Venturing programs would transition to use of the Scout Oath and Law, and in the case of the Venturers, the Boy Scout three-finger salute and sign as well. The Venturing change occurred in May 2014; and the Cub Scout change in mid-2015.\nRanks.\nThere are seven ranks that a Scout in the Scouts BSA program may attain (note that Eagle Palms are not considered ranks). To obtain a rank, a Scout must complete the requirements for that rank, as well as have a Scoutmaster Conference and a Board of Review (with the exception of Scout Rank). To obtain a rank you must first acquire the rank previous to it, with the exception of Scout rank in which a Scout can earn at anytime once they have completed the requirements for it. The ranks are in the following order: Scout, Tenderfoot, Second Class, First Class, Star Scout, Life Scout, and Eagle Scout. An increasing number of merit badges, as well as being in troop leadership positions, is required for the latter 3 ranks, plus other requirements. Certain ranks require specific merit badges and leadership positions.\nEagle Scout.\nEagle Scout is the highest rank one can receive in Scouts BSA. Since its introduction in 1911, the Eagle Scout rank has been earned by more than two million youth. Requirements include earning at least 21 merit badges and demonstrating Scout Spirit through the Scout Oath and Law, service, and leadership, all before or by age 18. This includes an extensive service project that the Scout plans, organizes, leads, and manages. Eagle Scouts are presented with a medal and a badge that visibly recognizes the accomplishments of the Scout. Additional recognition can be earned through Eagle Palms, awarded for completing additional tenure, leadership, and merit badge requirements.\nNational Scout jamboree.\nThe National Scout Jamboree is a gathering of Scouts and Venturers from across the US. It is usually held every four years, with some adjustment for special years such as the 2010 National Scout Jamboree that celebrated Scouting America centennial. The first jamboree was held in 1937 at the Washington Monument in Washington, D.C. There were 27,232 Scouts and Leaders present at the first National Jamboree. In 1950, the Boy Scouts of America hosted their second National Jamboree at Valley Forge, Pennsylvania. The event was to commemorate the organization's 40th anniversary. Since then, jamborees have been held in varying locations. From 1981 until 2010, the jamboree was held at Fort A.P. Hill, Virginia. A permanent location owned by Scouting America was sought in 2008 for future jamborees, high adventure programs and training. The Summit Bechtel Family National Scout Reserve near Beckley, West Virginia, became the permanent site beginning with the 2013 National Scout Jamboree.\nHigh adventure.\nScouting America operates several high-adventure bases at the national level. Each offers a wide range of programs and training; a typical core program may include sailing, wilderness canoeing or wilderness backpacking and camping trips. These bases are administered by the High Adventure Division of the National Council.\nThe high-adventure bases of Scouting America are Philmont Scout Ranch, Northern Tier National High Adventure Bases, Sea Base, and The Summit Bechtel Family National Scout Reserve.\nTraining.\nScouting America offers a wide variety of mandatory and optional training programs in youth protection, outdoor skills and leadership.\nAdult leader training.\nEvery adult leader must complete Youth Protection Training. Position-specific training is also required for all direct-contact leaders. Upon completion of basic training, a leader may wear the Trained emblem on his/her Scouting America uniform.\nSupplemental skill-specific training is also available to Scouting America volunteers to gain knowledge in outdoors skills including camping, hiking, first aid, Leave No Trace, swim safety, climbing safety, hazardous weather, and other skills.\nThe highest level of Scouting America training is Wood Badge, focused on helping participants develop leadership skills while participating in an outdoor program over five days. Some councils offer high-adventure training for adults using the Powder Horn program. Leaders can also take the Seabadge advanced leadership and management course.\nYouth leadership training.\nScout youth leaders may attend the unit-level Introduction to Leadership Skills for Troops. Local councils offer the advanced National Youth Leadership Training and the National Council offers the National Advanced Youth Leadership Experience conducted at Philmont Training Center. Scouting America also offers the NYLT Leadership Academy which trains youth staff members from across the country for council-level NYLT courses.\nVenturers and Sea Scouts may attend the unit-level Introduction to Leadership Skills for Crews or Introduction to Leadership Skills for Ships. Crew officers can attend Crew Officer Orientation, and then a council-provided Kodiak leadership training program.\nOrder of the Arrow members may attend the National Leadership Seminar, run multiple times each year by each region.\nNational Camping School.\nScouting America operates a National Camping School program which trains people how to run various departments or areas at resident camps. Some online training is offered, but most areas require an in-person week-long training program at one of the National Camping Schools. After successfully completing a week-long program, a person is entitled to wear the National Camping School patch. The regular-size patch may be worn on the right breast shirt pocket, in the temporary patch spot. National Camping School certification is valid for five years.\nCOPE.\nCOPE, which stands for Challenging Outdoor Personal Experience, is a program that consists of a series of tests of strength, agility, coordination, and problem-solving, individually and within groups.\nOutdoor program.\nScouts see nature as an adventurous place, and it is expected that when they get older the experience from their youth will make them nature lovers. Scouts envisage nature as a heritage. \n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"On breaking up camp leave two things behind you: 1. Nothing. 2. Your thanks.\" \u2014 Lord Baden-Powell in 1919.\nOrganization.\nNational Council.\nThe National Council is the corporate membership of Scouting America and consists of volunteer Scouters who meet annually. The day-to-day operations of the National Council are administered by the Chief Scout Executive and other national professional staff. National Council members include volunteers who are elected national officers and executive board members, regional presidents, the local council representatives, members at large, and honorary members. The national headquarters has been in Irving, Texas since 1979.\nSince the founding of Scouting America in 1910, the President of the United States has served as the organization's honorary chair during his term in office, former presidents serve as honorary vice chairs for their lifetimes.\nGovernance and the National Executive Board.\nThe Scouting America National Executive Board governs the organization. The 2015 National Executive Board consisted of 79 members.\nThe board is led by the national president, a volunteer elected by the National Council. Board members included regular elected members, regional presidents, and up to five appointed youth members. The Chief Scout Executive is the board secretary and non-voting member. The National Executive Board has a number of standing committees that correspond to the professional staff organization of the National Council.\nPresent and past members of the National Executive Board include Utah Senator Mitt Romney, Ernst &amp; Young CEO Jim Turley and AT&amp;T CEO Randall Stephenson. Other members included Latter-day Saint Church President Thomas S. Monson.\nNational Service Territories.\nFor administrative purposes, Scouting America is divided into sixteen National Service Territories (NSTs) including international areas for scouts with parents serving outside the US. Each NST encompasses multiple states or portions of states/counties.\nUntil 2021, Scouting America was divided into four regions for administrative purposes\u2014Central, Southern, Western, Northeast.\nLocal councils.\nThe Scouting America program is administered through local councils, each covering a geopolitical area that may vary from a single city to an entire state. Councils receive an annual charter from the National Council and are usually incorporated as a charitable organization.\nThe council level organization is similar to that of the National Council. The council executive board is headed by the council president and is made up of annually elected local community leaders. The board establishes the council program and carries out the resolutions, policies, and activities of the council. Board members serve without pay and some are volunteer Scouters working at the unit level. Youth members may be elected to the council executive board according to the council by-laws.\nThe Scout executive manages council operations\u2014including finance, property management, advancement and awards, registrations, and Scout Shop sales\u2014with a staff of other professionals and para-professionals. Volunteer commissioners lead the unit service functions of the council, help maintain the standards of Scouting America, and assure a healthy unit program.\nScouting America also charters two councils operating overseas, largely serving military base and diplomatic community families in Europe and Asia. The Transatlantic Council, headquartered in Italy, serves Scouting America units in Europe and Africa; the Far East Council, headquartered in Japan, serves units across Asia, including Troop 60 in New Delhi, India. The Aloha Council in Hawaii also serves Scouting America units in the American territories of American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands and in the sovereign countries of the Federated States of Micronesia, the Marshall Islands, and Palau.\nThe Greater New York Councils are unique in that they are divided into five boroughs with each led by a borough Scout executive and each borough then divided into districts.\nCouncils are divided into districts with leadership provided by the district executive, district chairman, and the district commissioner. Districts are directly responsible for the operation of Scouting units and, except for the district executive, are mostly staffed with volunteers. The voting members of each district consist of volunteer representatives from each chartered organization having at least one Scouting America unit, plus annually elected members-at-large who in turn elect the district chairman. Boroughs and districts are subdivisions of the local council and do not have a separate corporate status.\nChartered organizations and units.\nScouting America partners with community organizations, such as religious congregations, fraternal groups, service clubs, and other community associations, to provide the Scouting program for the particular neighborhood or community in which the particular organization wishes to reach out to youth and families. The connection with religious congregations stems back to at least 1910, when a Catholic parish church in Saint Paul, Minnesota chartered the first troop in the city.\nOrganizations hold charters issued by Scouting America and are known then as chartered organizations. Each chartered organization provides the meeting place for Scouting America youth, oversees the volunteer leaders, and agrees to follow the basic Scouting America safety policies and values-based program, and the organization is considered the \"owner\" of its local program, much like a franchise.\nWithin each chartered organization, there may be one or more \"units\". A unit is a group of youth and adults who are collectively designated as a Cub Scout pack, Scouts BSA troop, Venturing crew, or Sea Scout ship. Each chartered organization may charter as many units as it wishes, but usually only 3 or 4 (one unit for each program level). Scouting America councils provide the leader training, inter-unit activities, camping programs, volunteer and professional support, and insurance coverage. Units also create their own activities (such as monthly camping trips, outings, or service projects), and most meet weekly at the place of the chartered organization for youth to learn basic skill development and practice leadership in small groups known as dens and patrols.\nThe Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints was the first partner to sponsor Scouting in the United States. It adopted the program in 1913 as part of its Mutual Improvement Association program for young men, and it was the largest single sponsor of Scouting until it ceased sponsoring Scouting units at the end of 2019.\nLeadership.\nIn all Scouting units above the Cub Scout pack (i.e. units serving adolescent Scouts), leadership of the unit comprises both adult leaders (Scouters) and youth leaders (Scouts). In fact, this is a critical component of the program. In order to learn leadership, the youth must actually serve in leadership roles. Adult leaders may be either men or women in all positions.\nA properly run Scouts BSA troop is run by the Senior Patrol Leader, who is elected by the troop, and their assistant, who may either be elected or appointed. These and the other youth leaders are advised and supported by the adult leaders. \"Scouts are youth-led.\"\nFinance.\nThe National Council is incorporated as a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization and is funded from private donations, membership dues, corporate sponsors, and special events with total revenues of $237\u00a0million.\nIn addition to donations from individuals, Scouting America receives extensive donations from major corporations. In 2010, their top corporate donors were, in order, Intel, Emerson, Verizon, 3M, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, Pfizer, Valero, UPS, U.S. Bank, Eli Lilly, GE, and Monsanto.\nImpact on American life.\nScouting and Boy Scouts are well known throughout American culture and approximately 130\u00a0million Americans have participated in Scouting America programs at some time in their lives. The term \"Boy Scout\" is used to generally describe someone who is earnest and honest, or who helps others cheerfully; it can also be used as a pejorative term for someone deemed to be overly idealistic.\nProminent Americans in diverse walks of life, from filmmaker Steven Spielberg (who helped launch a merit badge in cinematography) to adventurer Steve Fossett to U.S. presidents, were Scouting America members as youths. Over two-thirds of all astronauts have had some type of involvement in Scouting, and eleven of the twelve men to walk on the Moon were Scouts, including Eagle Scouts Neil Armstrong and Charlie Duke. The pinewood derby\u2014a wood car racing event for Cub Scouts\u2014has been declared \"a celebrated rite of spring\" and was named part of \"America's 100 Best\" by \"Reader's Digest\".\nPresident Gerald Ford said, \"I can say without hesitation, because of Scouting principles, I know I was a better athlete, I was a better naval officer, I was a better congressman, and I was a better prepared President.\"\nFamed American illustrator Norman Rockwell's works were closely associated with the Boy Scouts of America for much of the 20th century.43 Beginning in 1913, Rockwell began illustrating covers of \"Boys' Life\", the magazine for BSA youth. He also drew the organization's annual calendar illustrations between 1925 and 1976.89\nIn 1969, as a tribute to Rockwell's 75th birthday, officials of Brown &amp; Bigelow and the Boy Scouts of America asked Rockwell to pose in \"Beyond the Easel\" for a calendar illustration. As part of the US Bicentennial celebrations in 1976, Rockwell's Scouting paintings toured the nation and were viewed by 280,000 people.155 In 2008, a twelve-city US tour of Rockwell's works was scheduled.\nAlvin Townley wrote in \"Legacy of Honor\" about the large positive impact of Eagle Scouts in America. Townley cited such examples as how Scouts, especially Eagle Scouts, were disproportionately represented among Hurricane Katrina's volunteer relief workers; just as they are disproportionately represented among members of the United States Senate.152 Former Governor Rick Perry of Texas is an Eagle Scout who defended BSA policies and restrictions against ACLU criticisms in his book, \"On My Honor: Why the American Values of the Boy Scouts Are Worth Fighting For\".\nMark Mays, CEO of Clear Channel Communications, told a magazine interviewer in May 2008 that, \"Particularly in the very impactful ages of youth 11\u00a0to\u00a014 years old, when they can really go astray and you're taking the time to spend with them and focus on cultural core values like reverent, trustworthy, loyal, and helpful\u2014all of those different things\u00a0...\u00a0Scouting has a huge positive impact on boys and their lives, and that in turn positively impacts our communities and society as a whole.\"\nMayor of New York City and business tycoon Michael Bloomberg, said that Scouting America's Scout Law required of all Scouts\u2014a Scout is trustworthy, loyal, helpful, friendly, courteous, kind, obedient, cheerful, thrifty, brave, clean, and reverent\u2014are \"all the American values\u00a0...\u00a0Americans have quaintly simplistic ways and direct ways of phrasing things\u00a0...\u00a0I think it's one of the great strengths of this country.\"116\nPeter Applebome, an editor of \"The New York Times\", wrote in 2003 of his experience as an adult participating with his son in Scouting activities, \"I feel lucky to have had this unexpected vehicle to share my son's youth, to shape it, and to be shaped by it as well.\" He concluded that, although Scouting is viewed by some as old-fashioned, \"Scouting's core values\u00a0...\u00a0are wonderful building blocks for a movement and a life. Scouting's genuinely egalitarian goals and instincts are more important now than they've ever been. It's one of the only things that kids do that's genuinely cooperative, not competitive.\"319\u2013320\nAt the turn of the 20th century, Halloween had turned into a night of vandalism, with destruction of property and cruelty to animals and people. Around 1912, the BSA, Boys Clubs and other neighborhood organizations came together to encourage a safe celebration that would end the destruction that had become so common on this night.\nScouting America is quite particular about how and when the Scout uniforms and insignia may be used in film and other portrayals; and for that reason, most films and television productions made in the US utilize \"ersatz\" Scouting organizations. Examples of this include the \"Order of the Straight Arrow\", portrayed in the \"King of the Hill\" cartoon series, and the \"Indian Guides\" depicted in the 1995 Chevy Chase film, \"Man of the House\". Exceptions include Disney's \"Follow Me, Boys!\" (1966; re-released 1976) and the closing shot of \"The Sopranos\", which shows Cub Scouts in full uniform.\nGood Turns.\nFrom the inception of the Scouting movement, Scouts have been urged to \"Do a Good Turn Daily\", the slogan for Scouting America. The first national Good Turn was the promotion of a safe and sane Fourth of July in 1912. During World War I, \"Every Scout to Save a Soldier\" was a slogan used to motivate children involved in Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts to help sell War savings stamps. Scouting for Food is an ongoing annual program begun in 1986 that collects food for local food banks.\nIn 1997, the BSA developed Service to America with a commitment to provide 200\u00a0million hours of service by youth members by the end of the year 2000. As part of Service to America, the BSA provided service projects in conjunction with the National Park Service. In October 2003, the Department of the Interior expanded the program with the creation of Take Pride in America, opening service to all Americans. Service to America became Good Turn for America in 2004 and expanded to address the problems of hunger, homelessness, and inadequate housing and poor health in conjunction with the Salvation Army, the American Red Cross, Habitat for Humanity, and other organizations.\nIncidents and concerns.\nOn February 1, 2019, the Boy Scouts of America renamed its flagship program, Boy Scouts, to Scouts BSA to reflect its policy change, allowing girls to join separate, all-girl troops.\nOn February 18, 2020, the National BSA filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. On November 16, 2020, the National BSA disclosed in their bankruptcy filings that more than 92,000 former Scouts had reported sexual abuse by members of the organization. In December 2021, the insurer for the Boy Scouts of America agreed to pay $800 million into the fund for survivors. In 2022, the Boy Scouts of America agreed to pay an additional $2.4 billion into the fund as part of a bankruptcy settlement with payments beginning in September 2023.\nSexual abuse cases.\nScouting sexual abuse cases are situations where youth involved in Scouting programs have been sexually abused by someone who is also involved in the Scouting program. J.L. Tarr, a US Chief Scout Executive in the 1980s, was quoted in an article regarding sexual assault cases against Scout leaders across all 50 states: \"That's been an issue since the Boy Scouts began.\" Several reports have surfaced over the years regarding incidents of sexual abuse within the Boy Scouts of America, including incidents of repeat offenders. There have also been several high-profile court cases that resulted in convictions and settlements involving such incidents. On October 19, 2012, the Boy Scouts of America were forced by court order to release more than 20,000 pages of documentation about 1,200 alleged child sexual abuse cases within the organization from between 1965 and 1985. Legal claims against Scouting America for such matters continue to the present day. After its bankruptcy in February 2020, more than 92,000 sexual abuse claims were filed with the bankruptcy court before the November 16, 2020, deadline to receive claims.\nIn the 1980s, Scouting America developed its Youth Protection program to educate youth, leaders, and parents about the problem and to introduce barriers to sexual abuse of children using the Scout program to reach victims. \"Two deep\" leadership dictates that no adult member can be alone with any youth member (other than their child). Shortly after joining, youth must discuss with their parents a pamphlet on sexual abuse. Before joining, adults must take a youth protection training course, which must be renewed every two years. Since 2003, new adult members must pass a criminal background check (adults who were already members had to pass a background check by 2008). The Youth Protection Plan from the organization is linked to in a CDC report on such programs.\nFinancial problems.\nIn recent decades, membership in Scouting America and income have declined.\nIn addition, the organization spent millions of dollars to contest and settle lawsuits arising from sexual misconduct by BSA volunteers and employees dating back to the 1960s. From 2015 to 2017, it paid nearly $12\u00a0million to the law firm Ogletree Deakins for litigation counsel. In its 2018 annual report, BSA officials said that the organization's future financial situation would depend on the outcome of various litigation and its costs. The annual report said that the BSA may have \"to pay damages out of its own funds to the extent the claims are not covered by insurance or if the insurance carriers are unable or unwilling to honor the claims.\"\nAccordingly, the BSA hired a law firm in December 2018 to investigate filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Such a bankruptcy could stop litigation of at least 140 lawsuits and prevent further lawsuits. In October 2019, the BSA raised membership rates to cover its increased operational expenses, particularly insurance costs.\nOn February 18, 2020, the organization filed for bankruptcy in the Bankruptcy court of the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware, listing liabilities of between $100 million and $500 million and assets of $1 billion to $10 billion. The bankruptcy filing came as the organization faced hundreds of sexual abuse lawsuits. As a result of the filing, all civil litigation against the organization was suspended. Local Councils and units remained largely unaffected as they are standalone units. BSA contends that it alone should be financially responsible for any settlements in the sex abuse case lawsuits. Plaintiffs have complained that BSA is hiding its assets through its affiliates. Critics of the filing derisively described the organization and its move as \"bankrupt, but not because it's broke.\"\nAnti-bullying movement.\nAfter reports surfaced in the 1970s and 1980s about bullying in the Boy Scouts, Boy Scouts of America tried to develop a no-tolerance bullying policy. In the 1990s, organization leaders acknowledged it had a problem with bullying, due in part to a pre-1970s \"boys will be boys\" attitude by adult leaders who believed that older boys who \"picked on\" younger or weaker Scouts \"toughened someone up\" and that boys who reported bullying were \"snitches\" and \"tattletales\".\nIn July 1987, a Boy Scout at the Goshen Scout Reservation was severely beaten in his sleep by several other Scouts. The Goshen staff responded by changing the layout of its campsites to prevent having sites in isolated areas, assigning camp staff members to each visiting troop as \"advisors\", and to watch for fights or other trouble resulting from conflicts at the various campsites.\nIn the 21st century, the Boy Scouts have adopted a \"Bullying Awareness Program\" which trains adults to recognize the signs of bullying, especially in isolated environments such as extended campouts in the wilderness or at summer camp. Parents are also advised on what to do and whom to contact should a Scout state other Scouts are bullying them. Dealing with the bullies themselves is also addressed, in particular, those bullies who \"game the system\", pretending to be compassionate and apologetic for bullying victims when adults confront them, only to return to such behaviors when the adults are no longer present.\nLDS departure.\nIn 2018, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints\u2014the largest charter organization supporting BSA\u2014cut ties with the BSA, substantially contributing to a net loss of nearly a million scouts and leaders. The decision was made partly in response to BSA membership policy changes, such as allowing girls, openly gay, and transgender people to participate in the organization. However, a joint statement released by the First Presidency of the LDS Church on May 8, 2018, reflects the LDS Church's official stance on the departure and states, in the last paragraph \"While the Church will no longer be a chartered partner of BSA or sponsor Scouting units after December 31, 2019, it continues to support the goals and values reflected in the Scout Oath and Scout Law and expresses its profound desire for Scouting's continuing and growing success in the years ahead.\"\nCommemorations.\n115th anniversary.\nDuring the weekend of February 8, 2025, the organization's 115th anniversary, sites across the U.S. were illuminated in red, white and blue, including Niagara Falls, the Empire State Building, and the Pennsylvania State Capitol."}

She was later converted into an attack submarine and redesignated SSN-599.\nHistory.\nCommissioned.\n\"Patrick Henry\"'s keel was laid down by the Electric Boat Division of General Dynamics Corporation, in Groton, Connecticut, on 26 May 1958. She was launched on 22 September 1959, sponsored by Mrs. Betty Arends (n\u00e9e Tychon), wife of Congressman Leslie C. Arends and was commissioned on 9 April 1960, with Commander Harold E. Shear in command of the Blue crew and Commander Robert L. J. Long commanding the Gold crew.\nCrewed alternately by a Blue and Gold crew, like all US Navy ballistic missile submarines, to maximize her submerged operations, \"Patrick Henry\" underwent shakedown with the Blue crew until 16 September 1960, when the Gold crew took over. The second fleet ballistic missile (FBM) submarine, she commenced her first deterrent patrol in December 1960 with her Blue Crew on board. When she surfaced off Holy Loch, Scotland, on 8 March 1961, she had set a record for her type, cruising submerged 66 days and 22\u00a0hours. \"Patrick Henry\" was the first ballistic missile submarine to enter Holy Loch, and the first to go alongside the submarine tender for replenishment and routine repair.\n\"Patrick Henry\" conducted 17 deterrent patrols from Holy Loch until December 1964 when she returned to Electric Boat. For 18 months she received complete and extensive overhaul and repair operations, including refueling of the S5W reactor plant and modifications to permit the handling of the Polaris A-3 missiles. After shakedown in mid-1966 off Puerto Rico and Cape Canaveral, Florida, \"Patrick Henry\" departed Charleston, South Carolina, in December for her eighteenth patrol, equipped with A-3 Polaris missiles and assigned to Submarine Squadron 14. On 1 March 1968, \"Patrick Henry\" completed her 22nd patrol at Holy Loch.\nDuring the early 1970s, \"Patrick Henry\"'s home port was Pearl Harbor, Hawaii.\nIn 1976, \"Patrick Henry\" moved to Mare Island Naval Shipyard at Vallejo, California, for refueling.\nDemonstration and shakedown operations, 1978.\nIn the spring of 1978, the \"Patrick Henry\" underwent Demonstration and Shakedown Operations (DASO). The purpose of the DASO was to ensure that the submarine's crew could safely meet the stringent requirements for handling, maintaining and operating her strategic weapons system. It also confirmed that the submarine's crew was able to target and launch her submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBM) correctly and certified that the crew and submarine were ready for operational patrol. Additionally, system performance data was collected about the weapons system and submarine while in an operational environment, which evaluates the readiness and performance of the weapon system.\nAfter transiting the Panama Canal, the Blue Crew successfully fired an A-3 Polaris missile off the coast of Cape Kennedy in July 1978, and the Gold Crew completed a successful missile firing several weeks later. The Gold Crew brought the \"Patrick Henry\" back through the Panama Canal and transited to Pearl Harbor. She remained with the Pacific Fleet into the 1980s.\nConversion to attack submarine, 1982.\nIn 1982 \"Patrick Henry\" and many of her sister ships had their ballistic missile tubes disabled and were reclassified as attack submarines (SSNs). \"Patrick Henry\" was redesignated SSN-599.\nDecommissioning and disposal.\n\"Patrick Henry\" was decommissioned and struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 25 May 1984, and as of 21 August 1997, she was disposed of through the Ship-Submarine recycling program at the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n\u00a0\"This article incorporates text from the public domain \"Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships\".

Constructed in 1796\u201397, it was designed to hold prisoners of war from France and its allies during the French Revolutionary Wars and Napoleonic Wars. By 1816, it had been largely demolished.\nThe hamlet of Norman Cross, now in Cambridgeshire, lies south of Peterborough, between the villages of Folksworth, Stilton, and Yaxley. The junction of the A1 and A15 roads is here. Traditionally in Huntingdonshire, Norman Cross gave its name to one of the hundreds of Huntingdonshire and, from 1894 to 1974, to Norman Cross Rural District.\nDesign and construction of prison camp.\nThe Royal Navy Transport Board was responsible for the care of prisoners of war. When Sir Ralph Abercromby communicated in 1796 that he was transferring 4,000 prisoners from the West Indies, the Board began the search for a site for a new prison. The site was chosen because it was on the Great North Road only north of London and was deemed far enough from the coast that escaped prisoners could not easily flee back to France. The site had a good water supply and close to sufficient local sources of food to sustain many thousands of prisoners and the guards. Work commenced in December 1796 with much of the timber building prefabricated in London and assembled on site. 500 carpenters and labourers worked on the site for three months. The cost of construction was \u00a334,581 11s 3d.\nThe design of the prison was based on that of a contemporary artillery fort. A ditch wide and about 5 feet deep (to prevent prisoners tunnelling out) was placed inside the wall (originally a wooden stockade fence, replaced with a brick wall in 1805) and guarded by 'silent sentries' who could not be seen by the prisoners. In 1797, \"The prisoners constantly sawed the inner palings [of the stockade] close to the ground, so they could be removed and replaced at night without fear of detection. In this manner they often got through the inner palings, but in crossing to the outer were always recaptured.\" The barracks for the garrison were placed outside and a large guard house (known as the Block House) containing troops and six cannon was placed right at the centre. The interior of the prison was divided into four quadrangles, each with four double-storey wooden accommodation blocks for 500 prisoners and four ablution blocks. One accommodation block was reserved for officers. Half of each quadrangle was a large exercise yard. The north-east quadrangle contained the prison hospital. There was also a windowless block known as the Black Hole in which prisoners were kept shackled on half rations as punishment, mainly for violence towards the guards although two prisoners were sent to the Black Hole for \"infamous vices\". 30 wells were sunk to draw drinking water for the prisoners and garrison.\nOperation.\nThe average prison population was about 5,500 men. The lowest number of prisoners recorded in any official document was 3,300 in October 1804 and the highest was 6,272 on 10 April 1810.\nNorman Cross was intended to be a model depot providing the most humane treatment of prisoners of war. Sir Rupert George was responsible for the \"care and custody\" of the French prisoners.\nMost of the men held in the prison were low-ranking soldiers and sailors, including midshipmen and junior officers, with a small number of privateers. About 100 senior officers and some civilians \"of good social standing\", mainly passengers on captured ships and the wives of some officers, were given \"parole d'honneur\" outside the prison, mainly in Peterborough, although some as far away as Northampton, Plymouth, Melrose, and Abergavenny. They were afforded the courtesy of their rank within English society. Some \"with good private means\" hired servants and often dined out while wearing full uniform. Three French officers died of natural causes while on parole and were buried with full military honours. Four French officers and five Dutch officers married English women while on parole. The most senior officer on parole from the prison was General Charles Lefebvre-Desnouettes who resided with his wife in Cheltenham from 1809 until they escaped back to France in 1811. General Ren\u00e9-Martin Pillet (1762\u20131816), Adjutant Commandant was confined here for breaking parole; he was allowed further parole and after again attempting to escape was sent to Chatham.\nAmong the prisoners in 1797 were Germans who had been conscripted into the French army. These were encouraged to enlist in the 60th Foot, which was raising a rifle-armed 5th Battalion in imitation of German \"j\u00e4gers\".\nClothing.\nThe French prisoners, whose main pastime was gambling, were accused by the British government of selling their clothes and few personal possessions to raise money for further gambling. In 1801, the British government issued statements blaming the French Consul for not supplying sufficient clothing (the British government had paid the French for all English prisoners held in France and French colonies to be clothed). In July 1801 Jeremiah Askew, a tradesman at Yaxley, was convicted of being in possession of palliasses and other articles bearing the government mark of the 'broad arrow'. He was sentenced to stand in the pillory at Norman Cross and two years of hard labour.\nSamuel Johnson and a Mr Serle, who visited the barracks, compiled a report on behalf of the British government, stating that the proportion of food allowance was fully sufficient to maintain both life and health, but added: \"provided it is not shamefully lost by gambling\". The Lords of the Admiralty, along with Johnson, instructed that naked prisoners should be clothed at once, without waiting for the French supply or payment for clothing.\nThe British government provided each naked prisoner with a yellow suit, a grey or yellow cap, a yellow jacket, a red waistcoat, yellow trousers, a neckerchief, two shirts, two pairs of stockings, and one pair of shoes. The bright colours were chosen to aid the recognition of escaped prisoners. In Foulley's model of the prison (at the Mus\u00e9e de l'Arm\u00e9e, Paris; pictured above) more than half the prisoners are represented wearing these clothes.\nFood.\nFood was prepared by cooks drawn from the prison ranks. The cooks, one for every 12 prisoners, were paid a small allowance by the British government. The initial daily food ration for each prisoner was 1\u00a0lb of beef, 1\u00a0lb of bread, 1\u00a0lb of potatoes, and 1\u00a0lb of cabbage or pease. As the majority of prisoners were Roman Catholic, herrings or cod was substituted for beef on Fridays. Each prisoner was also allowed 2\u00a0oz of soap per week. In November 1797, the British and French governments agreed that each should feed their own citizens in their enemy's prisons. The French provided a daily ration of one pint of beer, 8\u00a0oz of beef or fish, 26\u00a0oz of bread, 2\u00a0oz of cheese and 1\u00a0lb of potato or fresh vegetables. They were also allowed 1\u00a0lb of soap and 1\u00a0lb of tobacco per month. Patients in the prison hospital were given a daily ration of one pint of tea morning and evening, 16\u00a0oz of bread, 16\u00a0oz of beef, mutton or fish, one pint of broth, 16\u00a0oz of green vegetables or potato, and two pints of beer.\nThe British government went to great lengths to provide food of a quality at least equal to that available to locals. The senior officer from each quadrangle was permitted to inspect the food as it was delivered to the prison to ensure it was of sufficient quality.\nDespite the generous supply and quality of food, some prisoners died of starvation after gambling away their rations.\nEducation.\nMost prisoners were illiterate and were offered the opportunity to learn to read and write in their native language and English. Prisoners who could read were given access to books. News on the progress of the war, including successes and defeats on both sides, was reported to prisoners.\nIn April 1799, French prisoners at Liverpool were reported to have performed plays by Voltaire in a neat prison theatre they had constructed. In July 1799, Dutch prisoners at Norman Cross sought permission to use one building as a theatre. The Sea Lords refused. However, Foulley's model, depicting the prison as it was in about 1809, shows a theatre in the south-west quadrangle.\nReligion.\nThere was no prison chapel but a Catholic priest resided in the garrison barracks. From 1808, the former Bishop of Moulins \u00c9tienne-Jean-Baptiste-Louis des Gallois de La Tour, who lived in exile at Stilton, was permitted by the Admiralty to minister and provide charity to the prisoners at his own expense. He later became Archbishop of Bourges.\nHealth.\nSick prisoners were initially treated in the prison hospital by two French Navy surgeons and 24 orderlies.\nAs the number of prisoners increased, disease spread throughout the camp and 1,020 prisoners died in a typhus outbreak in 1800\u20131801. A special 'typhus cemetery' was dug near the camp.\nLeonard Gillespie, Surgeon to the Fleet, wrote in 1804 that pneumonia was common with some cases becoming fatal carditis. There were also many cases of consumption. A brick house for a resident British surgeon was built adjacent to the prison hospital in 1805.\nA peculiar outbreak of nyctalopia or night-blindness affected many of the prisoners in 1806. They became severely dyspeptic and completely blind from sunset until dawn, to the extent that their fitter companions had to lead them around the camp. Various treatments were tried and failed; finally they were cured with black hellebore, given as snuff, which relieved the dyspepsia and restored their night vision within a few days.\nA total of 1,770 prisoner deaths were recorded, the majority from disease, during the time the prison was in operation, although the records are incomplete.\nCraft and prison economy.\nAt the outbreak of the war, the Transport Board wrote that \"the prisoners in all the depots in the country are at full liberty to exercise their industry within the prisons, in manufacturing and selling any articles they may think proper excepting those which would affect the Revenue in opposition to the Laws, obscene toys and drawings, or articles made either from their clothing or the prison stores\".\nMany prisoners at Norman Cross made artefacts such as toys, model ships and dominoes sets from carved wood or animal bone, and straw marquetry. Examples of the prisoners' craftwork were sold to visitors and passersby. Some highly skilled prisoners were commissioned by wealthy individuals, some of the prisoners becoming very rich in the process. Archdeacon William Strong, a regular visitor to the prison, notes in his diary of 23 October 1801 that he provided a piece of mahogany and paid a prisoner \u00a31 15s 6d to build a model of the Block House and \u00a32 2s for a straw picture of Peterborough Cathedral.\nPrisoners were permitted to sell artefacts twice a week at the local market, or daily at the prison gate. Prices were regulated so the prisoners did not undersell local industries. In return, prisoners were permitted to buy additional food, tobacco, wine, clothes or materials for further work. In 1813 ten inmates on behalf of the prisoners were allowed to attend the sale of articles, a long tent was erected in the barrack-yard, where these were exhibited to the visitors, who had purchased articles through the summer, to the amount of \u00a350 to \u00a360 a week.\nAt the end of the war, the Transport Board noted that some prisoners had earned as much as 100 guineas. An advertisement in 1814 demonstrated that some items were made collectively and others by a solo craftsman.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The Exhibition of the Thuilleries, the Luxembourg, and the Palace of Charles IV which are now open, No. 42, Old Bond-street, are most uncommon proofs of human ingenuity; whether we take into consideration the many figures moving in all directions, and exercising their different trades on the material with which they are constructed, namely, the bone of beef, they are equally the objects of our admiration. The Thuilleries and the Luxembourg took two years and four months in arranging the architecture only; and the Palace of Charles IV was seven years in completing, being the labour of an individual. These celebrated productions were the work of the French prisoners, during their confinement at Norman Cross.\nThousands of Norman Cross artefacts survive today in local museums, including 800 in Peterborough Museum, and private collections. A collection of model ships made at Norman Cross is on display at Arlington Court in Devon.\nDuring December 1804, prisoners Nicholas Deschamps and Jean Roubillard were discovered forging \u00a31 bank notes. Engraved plates of a very high standard and printing implements were found. The former was convicted of forgery and the latter of uttering at the Huntingdon Assizes in 1805. Francois Raize gave evidence for the crown. Forging banknotes was a capital offence at the time. They were sentenced to death but this was commuted. They remained in Huntingdon Gaol until they received a free pardon from the Prince Regent and were moved to Norman Cross and repatriated with the prisoners of war to France in 1814.\nPrisoners at the Norman Cross site were not permitted to manufacture straw hats or bonnets (presumably so as not to impinge upon the local industry). The authorities appear to have enforced this stipulation: at Huntingdon Assizes in May 1811 John Lun, snr (twelve months) and three sons (six months) were sentenced to prison for a conspiracy, in endeavouring to persuade the NCOs and privates of the garrison to permit a quantity of straw to be conveyed into the site for the purpose of making straw hats. In September 1812 the North York Militia held a regimental court-martial lasting three days that reduced four sergeants to the ranks and reprimanded two others for conniving at the guards smuggling raw straw into the prison and the plaited product out.\nInsubordination and escapes.\nInsubordination was rife among prisoners. A force of Shropshire Militia, a battalion of army reserve, and a volunteer force from Peterborough were required to restrain the prisoners from breaking out during a particular period of defiance. As a boy, the author George Borrow lived at the camp from July 1811 to April 1813 with his father Lieutenant Thomas Borrow of the West Norfolk Militia; he described the place in \"Lavengro\".\nSix prisoners escaped in April 1801. Three of them were caught at Boston, Lincolnshire, and the remaining three were caught in a fishing boat off the Norfolk coast. In the hat of one was found a complete map of the Lincolnshire coast. Each year the number of attempts to escape increased, as did the numbers in each escape. Three groups of 16 men each escaped in late 1801. Incomplete tunnels were discovered in 1802.\nIn October 1804 the press reported the prisoners created a disturbance with the intention of breaking the perimeter fencing. Assistance was sent for from Peterborough. A troop of Yeomanry galloped to support, later followed by two more troops and an infantry unit. The prisoners had cut down a part of the wood enclosure during the night, nine of them effected their escape through the aperture. At daybreak, it was discovered in another part of the prison that prisoners had undermined a distance of 34 feet towards the great South road under the fosse which surrounded the prison, although the fosse was four feet deep, and no tools were discovered with them. Five escapees were taken.\nDuring the night, several prisoners escaped in February 1807.\nThree escapees were retaken near Ryde heading for Southampton in April 1807.\nThe agent at the depot (camp commander), Captain Pressland RN, was inviting tenders for the building of a wall, in August 1807. This may have become known to the prisoners as a major escape attempt was made.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;About a fortnight ago a formidable attempt was made by the prisoners of war at Norman Cross to effect their escape from confinement. Between ten and eleven o'clock at night a force of 500 of them rushed all at once violently against the interior paling of the prison, and in an instant levelled one angle of it with the ground. They were proceeding to make a like experiment upon the next inclosure (constructed, like the former, of wood), when they were charged by the military of the barracks, and more than 40 were severely wounded with the bayonet before they were driven back to their confines. None escaped: but in consequence of this attempt a vast inclosure of brick-work is now building about the prison; is to be 14 feet high, and nearly a mile in circumference.\nAfter the second of these two major escape attempts in 1804 and 1807, the wooden stockade fence was soon replaced with a brick wall.\nOne prisoner, Charles Francois Marie Bourchier, stabbed a civilian, Alexander Halliday, while attempting to escape on 9 September 1808. He was convicted at the Huntingdon Assizes and sentenced to death by hanging. He was taken from Huntingdon Gaol on Friday 16th and executed at Norman Cross in front of the prisoners and the whole garrison. This was the only civil execution at Norman Cross. After the stabbing, the guards, having seen two or three other knives, searched the entire prison and 700 daggers were found.\nOn 24 September 1808, an English sloop of 44 tons called the \"Margaret Anne\" (William Tempel, master, of Barton) arrived at Calais, laden with 18 tons of coals. She was seized in the night of the 20th, in the Humber, by three French prisoners who had escaped from Norman Cross.\nIn November 1809, two French Navy officers escaped by secreting themselves in the soil carts of the prison, in which they were drawn out of the confines of the depot.\nIn December 1809 an inquest took place on Jean Barthelemy Toohe, a French prisoner of war who, as he was endeavouring to make his escape over the pailing of the prison, was fired at by the sentinel on duty; the ball entered his back, and he died shortly afterwards.\nDuelling continued amongst prisoners. On 15 May 1811 at Norman Cross, two fought with scissors attached to sticks. One duellist wounded the survivor twice, before the latter made the thrust that proved fatal. It was reported that \"On Saturday the 19th an inquisition was taken at Norman Cross Barracks, on view of the body of Julien Cheral, a French prisoner of war, who met his death by a fellow prisoner of the name of Jean Francois Pons stabbing. Verdict \u2014 Self Defence.\"\nIn January 1812, a French prisoner was shot whilst escaping after he had overpowered a guard and stolen a bayonet. The guard was committed to Huntingdon Gaol for the next assizes on a charge of manslaughter.\nIn August 1812 Prosper Louis, 7th Duke of Arenberg, was sent to Norman Cross after refusing to conform to the new reporting rules of his parole at Bridgnorth, where he was staying with his wife, St\u00e9phanie Tascher de La Pagerie (a niece of Empress Jos\u00e9phine). After a period, he agreed to follow the reporting requirement and was paroled again.\nDuring August 1813, escaped prisoners from Norman Cross were discovered as far away as Hampshire.\nMilitary units.\nIn July 1810 the Northumberland Militia were inspected at the barracks by Hugh Percy, 2nd Duke of Northumberland. After he had reviewed them, the duke presented the commanding officer with \u00a3150 for the regiment to regale themselves with.\nOn 22 April 1812 the Edinburgh Militia relieved the 2nd West York at Yaxley barracks, and the latter regiment marched to Colchester. However, the Edinburgh's Militia were soon sent north to deal with Luddite machine-breaking and with a very large group of French prisoners arriving from the Peninsula the guards had to be reinforced quickly. The Bedfordshire Militia were sent from Littlehampton in wagons changed at each town, the officers in post chaises, the journey of taking just six days (29 April to 4 May).\nMen from the following units were stationed at the prison:\nArrival and repatriation.\nMany of the prisoners arrived via Portsmouth or Plymouth and were marched hundreds of miles to Norman Cross.\nIn April 1797 six transports having on board near 1,000 French prisoners disembarked at King's Lynn from Falmouth. The prisoners, under an escort of the Lincoln Militia marched from there to Norman Cross. Most prisoners arrived on foot from Portsmouth, Plymouth, Hull, Great Yarmouth, and other ports.\nIn October 1797, 300 prisoners embarked from Peterborough quay to be exchanged. The sea trip to the continent was by cartel ship. When the first peace was proclaimed, prisoners were taken to Wisbech in lighters to join others in Wisbech Gaol to depart from the Port of Wisbech for France.\nNot all prisoners waited for repatriation after the end of the war. A number of the Dutch prisoners expressed their readiness to enlist into the service of Britain. In January 1807 upwards of 60 of them, whose services had been accepted, were marched under an escort of the Pembrokeshire Militia, to Portsmouth, to be distributed on board ships of war.\nPeace was finally proclaimed with France in 1814, following Napoleon's defeat and consequent abdication. The prisoners, the garrison guards and local people joined together in celebrations. The first division of 500 prisoners left on 5 April. The Star reported \"We are sorry to add that on their way to the sea coast for embarkation, a few indulged in drinking to such excess, that two of them perished in a fit of intoxication, and nearly thirty were left on the road unable to proceed to their native land. They carry home with them about six thousand pounds in English money, being the profits on the sale of the toys, &amp;c. which they manufactured at the depot\".\nThe remaining prisoners left the garrison by June 1814. A few decided to remain in England and settled near Yaxley and Stilton.\nDemolition and survivals.\nIn April 1815, \"1,000 Yards of capital Board Fencing, now standing round the burial ground appropriated to the late French prisoners, near Norman Cross Inn\" were advertised for sale. The wooden buildings were dismantled in June 1816 and the parts sold at auction. Some of the buildings were relocated to nearby towns although much of the timber structures were sold as firewood.\nThe site is considered of national importance and has been classified as a scheduled monument. The commander of the depot was the agent and his house survives, as the Old Governor's House. The restored stables are now a privately owned art gallery. Norman House, the barrack master's house, also survives. Both the Old Governor's House and Norman House are Grade II listed buildings.\nMemorial.\nThe memorial to the 1,770 prisoners who died at Norman Cross was erected in 1914 by the Entente Cordiale Society beside the Great North Road. The bronze Imperial Eagle was stolen in 1990, but replaced with a new one in 2005 following a fundraising appeal.\nWhen a section of the A1 was upgraded to motorway standard in 1998 the memorial required relocating. On 2 April 2005, the Duke of Wellington, a patron of the appeal, unveiled the restored memorial on a new site beside the A15. A replacement bronze eagle, sculpted by John Doubleday, was placed on the re-sited column.\nStudy.\nAn archaeological dig was carried out on part of the site by Channel 4 series \"Time Team\" in 2009. Part of the wall, an accommodation block, ablution hut and burial ground were uncovered. The episode, \"Death and Dominoes: The First POW Camp\", of series 17 of \"Time Team\" was broadcast in October 2010. \nSite ownership and conservation.\nIn 2025 the site of the Norman Cross prison depot was bought by the Nene Park Trust, a purchase supported with grants from Historic England and the National Lottery Heritage Fund. The site is now open to the public.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

In the late 1980s, The Sentencing Project became engaged in research and public education on a broad range of criminal justice policy issues. \nAdvocacy.\nThe Sentencing Project works with other organisations and public officials to influence criminal justice policies at the federal, state, and local level. The Sentencing Project was part of a national coalition supporting the bipartisan Sentencing Reform and Corrections Act in the 114th Congress. The organisation's executive director testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee in support of the legislation.\nIn 2010, The Sentencing Project contributed to the passage of the Fair Sentencing Act, which reduced the disparities in sentences associated with convictions for possessing or trafficking in crack cocaine compared to powder cocaine. Representatives of the organisation have often testified before Congress, the U.S. Sentencing Commission, the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, and other government and scholarly meetings.\nResearch.\nIn 2016, The Sentencing Project was active in the national debate about racial and ethnic disparities in arrests, sentencing and incarceration, and has monitored and reported on the denial of voting rights to individuals with felony convictions. It consistently criticises what it considers the ineffectiveness and excessive public expense associated with mass incarceration and extended prison terms.\nIn 2016, the organisation produced a state-by-state breakdown on the disenfranchisement of citizens convicted of felonies entitled \"Six Million Lost Voters\". It documented 6.1 million potential voters, including more than 4 million who had long since completed their sentences, unable to participate because of state laws disenfranchising them. Florida, a perennial swing state, led the country with 1.5 million people convicted of felonies who could not vote. \nIn recent years, The Sentencing Project has published reports and research on mandatory minimum sentences and their impact on judicial discretion; the increased reliance in the courts on life sentences, often without opportunities for parole; prison closures and repurposing; the impact of racial perceptions in criminal justice policy; the war on drugs and its collateral consequences; juvenile justice issues; women in prison; the children of prisoners and the long-term social impact of mass incarceration policies. \nLeadership.\nMarc Mauer has been the executive director of The Sentencing Project since 2005. He has authored a number of books, articles, and studies about the criminal justice system. University of Pittsburgh School of Law professor David Harris called Mauer \"the go-to guy for any major media organization or any legislative body that wants the truth on what's been happening with our prisons and our jails ... His testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee in October 2015 ... should be required reading for every public official in this country.\"\nThe Sentencing Project is governed by a 10-member board of lawyers, academics, and practitioners, chaired by American University law professor Cynthia E. Jones.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

His writings were published in the United Kingdom, Canada, the US, and the USSR; his notable books related to Scouting include \"The Birch Bark Roll\" and the \"Boy Scout Handbook\". He incorporated what he believed to be American Indian elements into the traditions of the BSA.\nEarly life.\nSeton was born in South Shields, County Durham, England to Scottish parents. His family emigrated to British North America in 1866. After settling in Lindsay, Canada West Seton spent most (after 1870) of his childhood in Toronto, and the family is known to have lived at 6 Aberdeen Avenue in Cabbagetown. As a youth, he retreated to the woods of the Don River to draw and study animals as a way of avoiding his abusive father. He attended the Ontario College of Art in 1879, studying with John Colin Forbes, then won a scholarship in art to the Royal Academy in London, England in 1880. He went out into the field, sometimes accompanied by William \"Willie\" Brodie jr., the son of the naturalist Dr. William Brodie. The death of Willie in a canoeing accident was a blow to Seton. In the 1890s, he studied at the Acad\u00e9mie Julian in Paris In 1893-4, he was elected an associate member of the Royal Canadian Academy of Arts.\nOn Seton's 21st birthday his father presented him with an invoice for all of the expenses connected with his childhood and youth, including the fee charged by the doctor who delivered him. According to one writer, he paid the bill, but never spoke to his father again. In his autobiography, \"Trail of An Artist-naturalist: The Autobiography of Ernest Thompson Seton\", he discusses the incident in detail, but, since he hadn't \"a cent of money,\" he could not pay his father. He went immediately to work and used the money he made to leave the household.\nIn 1882, he joined his brother on a homestead outside Carberry, Manitoba, where he began to write. In 1891, he published \"The Birds of Manitoba\" and was appointed Provincial Naturalist by the government of Manitoba. He continued to publish books about Manitoba for decades to come, including \"The Life Histories of Northern Animals: An Account of the Mammals of Manitoba\" and lived in Manitoba, before moving to New York and Connecticut. In 1930, when he moved to Santa Fe, New Mexico.\nHe changed his name to Ernest Thompson Seton (after initially changing it to Ernest Seton-Thompson), believing that Seton had been an important family name. He became successful as a writer, artist, and naturalist, and moved to New York City to further his career. Seton later lived at Wyndygoul, an estate that he built in Cos Cob, a section of Greenwich, Connecticut. After experiencing vandalism by the local youth, Seton invited them to his estate for a weekend where he told them what he claimed were stories of the American Indians and of nature. Seton was an early and influential member of the Camp-Fire Club of America, hosting several of the club's earliest official events at his Wyndygoul estate. \nHe formed the Woodcraft Indians in 1902 and invited the local youth to join. Despite the name, the group was made up of non-native boys and girls. The stories became a series of articles written for the \"Ladies Home Journal\", and were eventually collected in \"The Birch Bark Roll of the Woodcraft Indians\" in 1906. Shortly after, the Woodcraft Indians evolved into the Woodcraft Rangers, which was established as a non-profit organization for youth programming in 1922.\nSince 1922, Woodcraft Rangers has served Los Angeles youth with Seton's model of character building, which encompasses service, truth, fortitude, and beauty. Since then, Woodcraft Rangers youth have been received in a safe environment to encourage the discovery of their own talents. Today the Woodcraft Rangers organization serves over 15,000 youth in the Los Angeles county by helping them find pathways to purposeful lives. They offer expanded learning opportunities to youth from kindergarten to twelfth grade. Youth participants are encouraged to discover their natural talents and are embraced daily with the belief that all children are innately good.\nScouting.\nSeton met Scouting's founder, Lord Baden-Powell, in 1906. Baden-Powell had read Seton's book \"The Birch Bark Roll of the Woodcraft Indians\" and was greatly intrigued by it. The pair met and shared ideas. Baden-Powell went on to found the Scouting movement worldwide and Seton became the president of the committee that founded the Boy Scouts of America (BSA) and was its first (and only) Chief Scout. Seton's \"Woodcraft Indians\" (a youth organization) combined with the early attempts at Scouting from the YMCA and other organizations and with Daniel Carter Beard's Sons of Daniel Boone, to form the BSA. The work of Seton and Beard is in large part the basis of the Traditional Scouting movement.\nSeton served as Chief Scout of the BSA from 1910 to 1915 and incorporated what he believed to be American Indian elements into the traditions of the BSA. He had significant personality and philosophical clashes with Beard and James E. West.\nIn addition to disputes about the content of Seton's contributions to the Boy Scout Handbook, conflicts also arose about the suffragist activities of his wife, Grace Gallatin Seton Thompson, and his British citizenship. The citizenship issue arose partly because of his high position within the BSA and the federal charter West was attempting to obtain for the BSA requiring its board members to be United States citizens. Seton drafted his written resignation on January 29, 1915, but did not send it to the BSA until May. The position of Chief Scout was eliminated and the position \"Chief Scout Executive\" was taken on by James West. In 1931, Seton became a United States citizen.\nPersonal life.\nBritish by birth, Seton was not naturalized as Canadian (as status did not legally exist until 1947; he thus remained a British subject) and became an American in 1931. He was married twice. His first marriage was to Grace Gallatin in 1896. Their only daughter, Ann (1904\u20131990), later known as Anya Seton, became a best-selling author of historical and biographical novels. According to Ann's introduction to the novel \"Green Darkness\", Grace was a practicing Theosophist.\nErnest and Grace divorced in 1935, and Ernest soon married Julia Moss Buttree. Julia wrote works by herself and with Ernest. They did not have any biological children, but in the 1930s they sought to adopt Moss Buttree's niece, Leila Moss, who lived with them for years in New Mexico. In 1938, they adopted an infant daughter, Beulah (Dee) Seton (later Dee Seton Barber). Dee Seton Barber, a talented embroiderer of articles for synagogues such as Torah mantles, died in 2006.\nSeton called his father, Joseph Logan Thompson, \"the most selfish man I ever knew, or heard of, in history or in fiction.\" He cut off ties completely after being made to pay off an itemized list of all expenses he had cost his father, up to and including the doctor's fee for his delivery, a total of $537.50.\nSeton's parents lived out their lives in Toronto, as did brother John Enoch Thompson (abt. 1846\u20131932).\nTwo brothers, Joseph Logan Thompson (1849\u20131922) and Charles Seton Thompson (1851\u20131925), moved to British Columbia. Besides Seton, George Seton Thompson (1854\u20131944) moved to Illinois and died there.\nWriting and later life.\nSeton was an early pioneer of the modern school of animal fiction writing, his most popular work being \"Wild Animals I Have Known\" (1898), which contains the story of his killing of the wolf Lobo. Four stories from this collection would be republished as \"Lobo, Rag, and Vixen\" (1900). He later became involved in a literary debate known as the nature fakers controversy, after John Burroughs published an article in 1903 in the \"Atlantic Monthly\" attacking writers of sentimental animal stories. The controversy lasted for four years and included important American environmental and political figures of the day, including President Theodore Roosevelt.\nFor his work, \"Lives of Game Animals Volume 4\", Seton was awarded the Daniel Giraud Elliot Medal from the National Academy of Sciences in 1928. In 1931, he became a United States citizen. Seton was associated with the Santa Fe arts and literary community during the mid-1930s and early 1940s, which was a group of artists and authors, including author and artist Alfred Morang, sculptor and potter Clem Hull, painter Georgia O'Keeffe, painter Randall Davey, painter Raymond Jonson, leader of the Transcendental Painters Group and artist Eliseo Rodriguez. He was made a member of the Royal Canadian Academy of Arts.\nIn 1933, Seton purchased in Santa Fe County, New Mexico, United States. Seton ran training camps for youth leaders and had a small publisher named Seton Village Press that closed in 1943 due to World War II. The tract eventually grew to . Seton Village was established as an unincorporated community.\nSeton designed and built his castle as a 32-room, multi-level building with a flat-roof and rough hewn stone wall exterior. The interior had oak floors and plaster walls with the ceilings supported by log rafters. The castle was built on a hill at an elevation of . It is designated a National Historic Landmark and a New Mexico State Cultural Property. The castle burned down while being restored in 2005. The Academy for the Love of Learning, which owns the property, has decided to preserve the castle ruins as a \"contemplative garden\".\nDeath.\nHe died in Seton Village, New Mexico, at the age of 86. Seton was cremated in Albuquerque, New Mexico. In 1960, in honor of his 100th birthday and the 350th anniversary of Santa Fe, his daughter, Dee and his grandson, Seton Cottier (son of Anya), scattered the ashes over Seton Village from an airplane.\nLegacy.\nThe Philmont Scout Ranch houses the Seton Memorial Library and Museum. Seton Castle in Santa Fe, built by Seton as his last residence, housed many of his other items. Seton Castle burned down in 2005 during an attempt at restoration, but all the artwork, manuscripts, books, etc., had been removed to storage before renovation was to have begun.\nThe Academy for the Love of Learning, an educational organization in Santa Fe, acquired Seton Castle and its contents in 2003. The new Academy Center that opened in 2011 includes a gallery and archives featuring artwork and other materials as part of its Seton Legacy Project. The Seton Legacy Project organized a major exhibition on Seton opening at the New Mexico History Museum on May 23, 2010, the catalog published as \"Ernest Thompson Seton: The Life and Legacy of an Artist and Conservationist\" by David L. Witt.\nRoger Tory Peterson drew inspiration for his field guide from the simple diagram of ducks that Seton included in \"Two Little Savages\".\nSeton is honored by the Ernest Thompson Seton Scout Reservation in Greenwich, Connecticut, and with the E.T. Seton Park in Toronto, Ontario. Obtained in the early 1960's as the site of the future Metro Toronto Zoo, the land was later used to establish parkland and home to the Ontario Science Centre. A plaque is found on the front wall of 6 Aberdeen Avenue in Toronto, where Seton had lived as a child.\nIn pop culture.\nIn television.\n\"\" (, \"Seton Doubutsuki: Kuma no Ko Jacky\") was a 26-episode anime television series based on Seton's novel of the same name, and was first broadcast in 1977.\nIn 1979, a 26-episode anime series based on Seton's 1922 book \"Bannertail: The Story of a Gray Squirrel\" was produced in Japan by Nippon Animation, called (, \"Sh\u012bton D\u014dbutsuki Risu no Ban\u0101\").\nIn 1989\u20131990, Eiken released \"Seton D\u014dbutsuki\" (, '\"Seton Animal Chronicles\"'), a 45-episode anime TV series adapted from the manga \"Seton's Wild Animals\" (), depicting the different literary works of Seton, including his 1898 \"Wild Animals I Have Known\". \"Lobo, the King of Currumpaw\" (episodes 17 and 18) was a notable episode of the show which many viewers later learned of when the storyline was plotted into a popular 2009 TV documentary entitled \"The Wolf That Changed America\". The cartoon was dubbed in German and Arabic and saw an emerging popularity among Arabs in the early 1990s as \"Mokhles Sadik ul Hayawaan\" (, \"'Mokhles, Animals' Friend\"').\n\"Chink, the Development of a Pup\" was adapted into a cartoon in Russian in 1992.\nIn October 2015, the Comedy Central show \"Drunk History\" gave a short, drunk history lesson by Mike Still (season 3, episode 10, second act) in which Seton is portrayed by Colin Hanks. It mostly concentrates on the story of Lobo, but also mentions the roots of the Boy Scouts and helping out troubled teens.\nIn literature and manga.\nThe five-volume manga \"Seton's Wild Animals\" () by Sanpei Shirato, published between 1961 and 1965, portrayed the various literary works of Seton. Kenji Uchiyama translated Seton's work for the manga from English into Japanese.\nIn 1988, Yury Iosifovich Koval published a short novel called \"\u0428\u0430\u043c\u0430\u0439\u043a\u0430\" (\"Shamayka\"), a retelling of \"The Slum Cat\".\nIn a 1993 issue of the Japanese manga \"Diamond is Unbreakable\", the character Jotaro Kujo references Seton's quote \"there is no animal that cannot be tracked\".\nSeveral of Seton's works are written from the perspective of a predator and were an influence upon Robert T. Bakker's \"Raptor Red\" (1995).\nFrom 2004\u20132006, manga artist Jiro Taniguchi and scenarist Yoshiharu Imaizumi published \"Sh\u012bton\" (), a four-volume manga romanticizing the life of Seton. These manga were not translated into English, but appeared in French, Italian and Spanish. The French titles are:\nSeton's appearance inspired the design of the character Shiton Anehata, a scholar and zoophile who is one of the Abashiri convicts in the manga \"Golden Kamui\".\nSeton is also mentioned in Philip Roth's 2010 novel, \"Nemesis\", where he is credited for having introduced Indian lore to the American camping movement.\nArchives.\nThere is an Ernest Thompson Seton fonds at Library and Archives Canada. It is archival reference number R7616 and former archival reference number MG29-D108. The fonds consists of 6.2 metres of textual records, 1,220 photographs, 118 drawings, and other media.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He was known for his deadpan style, curmudgeonly persona, musical routines, and jokes about his mother-in-law and wife.\nEarly life.\nLes Dawson was born in Collyhurst, Manchester, on 2 February 1931, the only child of bricklayer Leslie Dawson (2 August 1905 \u2013 10 April 1970) and Julia Nolan (14 January 1908 \u2013 29 September 1957), who was of Irish descent. His first job was in the parcels department of the Manchester Co-op. He worked briefly as a journalist on the \"Bury Times\".\nCareer.\nEarly in life, Dawson wrote poetry and kept it secret. It was not expected that someone of his working class background would have literary ambitions. In a BBC Television documentary, he spoke of his love for canonical figures in English literature, in particular the 19th-century essayist Charles Lamb, whose florid style influenced Dawson's. As a young man he appeared with The Nelson Players in Nelson, Lancashire as Mr Justice Wainwright and Carter, chief clerk to Sir Wilfrid Robarts QC in Agatha Christie's play \"Witness for the Prosecution\" in December 1956.\nDawson wrote in his autobiography that he had a job as a pianist in a Parisian brothel. Making a living as a pianist evolved into comedy when he got laughs from deliberately bad piano-playing by playing \"all the wrong notes in exactly the right order\" and complaining to the audience. He first rose to public prominence on the talent show \"Opportunity Knocks\" in 1967 and worked as a comic on British television for the rest of his life.\nTelevision series in which he appeared included the panel game \"Jokers Wild\" (1969\u201373) hosted by Barry Cryer, \"Sez Les\" (1969\u201376) and \"Dawson's Weekly\" (1975), all for Yorkshire Television. After joining the BBC, his TV projects were \"The Dawson Watch\" (1979\u201380), written by Andy Hamilton and Terry Ravenscroft, \"The Les Dawson Show\" (1978\u201389), written by Terry Ravenscroft, and the quiz show \"Blankety Blank\", which he presented from 1984 until its cancellation in 1990. Dawson starred in \"Listen to Les\" on BBC Radio 2 in the 1970s and 1980s.\nHe made many appearances on BBC Television's variety show, \"The Good Old Days\", in the 1970s and 1980s. Dawson co-hosted Prince Edward's charity television special \"The Grand Knockout Tournament\" in 1987. When Richard Wilson turned down the part of Victor Meldrew in the BBC sitcom \"One Foot In The Grave\", writer David Renwick considered Dawson for the role, but Wilson changed his mind before it was offered.\nIn 1991, Dawson starred in the BBC television production of \"Nona\", an adaptation of the 1977 play \"La Nona\" (\"Grandma\") by Roberto Cossa for the \"Performance\" series. Performing in drag, he was cast as a 100-year old, compulsive eater in a Buenos Aires household.\nDawson was the subject of \"This Is Your Life\" on two occasions, in December 1971 when Eamonn Andrews surprised him on \"Opportunity Knocks\", and again 21 years later, in what would be one of his last television appearances, when he was surprised by Michael Aspel on stage at the Theatre Royal, Plymouth, at the curtain call of the pantomime \"Dick Whittington\" in December 1992. His final TV appearance was on the LWT series \"Surprise, Surprise\" hosted by Cilla Black, in which he sang a comic rendition of \"I Got You Babe\" with a woman from the audience who wanted to sing with him. The episode was aired shortly after his death.\nDawson was a heavy smoker and drinker. When not working he would often drink a bottle of whisky and smoke 50 cigarettes a day. Dawson was initiated into the famous show business fraternity, the Grand Order of Water Rats and served as that order's \"King Rat\" in 1985.\nDawson also wrote novels. He told his second wife, Tracy, \"Always remind them \u2013 I was a writer too.\"\nRoutines and image.\nDawson's style as a comic was world-weary, lugubrious and earthy. Some of his routines featured Roy Barraclough and himself as elderly Lancashire women, Cissie Braithwaite and Ada Shufflebotham. Barraclough's character Cissie had pretensions of refinement and corrected Ada's malapropisms or vulgar expressions. As authentic characters of their day, they spoke some words aloud but mouthed others, particularly those pertaining to bodily functions and sex. The characters were based on those Les Dawson knew in real life. He explained that this mouthing of words (or \"mee-mawing\") was a habit of Lancashire millworkers communicating over the loud noise of looms, then resorted to in daily life for indelicate subjects. To further portray the reality of northern, working-class women, Cissie and Ada would sit with folded arms, occasionally adjusting their bosoms by a hoist of the forearms. Many Cissie and Ada sketches were written by Terry Ravenscroft. This was also typical of pantomime dame style, an act copied from his hero, Norman Evans and his act \"Over the Garden Wall\". \nDawson was portly and often dressed in John Bull costume. In his later BBC television shows he introduced a troupe of fat dancing ladies called the Roly Polys. \nHe was a talented pianist but developed a gag in which he played a familiar piece such as Beethoven's \"Moonlight Sonata\" and then introduced hideously wrong notes (while keeping the tune recognisable) without appearing to realise, smiling unctuously and relishing the accuracy and soul of his own performance.\nHaving broken his jaw in a boxing match, he could pull grotesque faces by pulling his jaw over his upper lip. This is described in the first volume of Dawson's autobiography \"A Clown Too Many\".\nPersonal life and death.\nDawson was married to his first wife, Margaret, from 25 June 1960 until her death on 15 April 1986 from cancer. They had three children: Julie, Pamela and Stuart. Dawson nearly died in February 1985 from a failing prostate gland, complicated by blood poisoning. On 3 September 1988, he suffered a heart attack in Blackpool and spent nine days in hospital. He married his second wife, Tracy Roper, on 6 May 1989; she was 17 years younger. They had a daughter, Charlotte, who was born on 3 October 1992. He died suddenly, aged 62, on 10 June 1993 from a heart attack, during treatment for a heart complaint at St Joseph's Hospital in Longsight, Manchester.\nLegacy.\nOn 23 October 2008, 15 years after his death, a bronze statue by Graham Ibbeson was unveiled by his widow Tracy and daughter Charlotte in the ornamental gardens next to the pier in St Anne's-on-Sea, Lancashire, where Dawson lived for many years.\nIn the \"Comedians' Comedian\", a three-hour programme on UK's Channel 4 on 1 January 2005, Dawson was 37th in the top 50 comedians of all time, voted by fellow comedians and business insiders.\nThe BBC broadcast, on BBC Two, \"The Many Faces of Les Dawson\", a retrospective, on Christmas Eve 2011.\nOn 1 June 2013 ITV broadcast \"Les Dawson: An Audience with That Never Was\". The programme featured a Pepper's ghost projection of Dawson, presenting content for a 1993 edition of \"An Audience with...\" to be hosted by Dawson but unused due to his death two weeks before recording. The show served as a tribute and featured celebrities including Bruce Forsyth, Cilla Black, Terry Wogan and Ken Dodd. Also among the audience were Dawson's widow Tracy and daughter Charlotte.\nOn 10 February 2014, the BBC reported that Dawson's daughter Charlotte had found a 110-page \"unpublished story of love and mystery, titled \"An Echo of Shadows\", [that] was written under the name Maria Brett-Cooper...\".\nIn 2020, Les Dawson's early years in Paris were portrayed in Sky Arts' series \"Urban Myths\" in the episode \"Les Dawson's Parisienne Adventure\", with Mark Addy as the older Les and John Bradley as young Les.\nIn 2022, Jon Culshaw portrayed Dawson as part of The Edinburgh Assembly's Fringe programme.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

She is the Abby Rockefeller Mauz\u00e9 Professor of the Social Studies of Science and Technology at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. She obtained a BA in social studies and later a PhD in sociology and personality psychology at Harvard University. She now focuses her research on psychoanalysis and human-technology interaction. She has written several books focusing on the psychology of human relationships with technology, especially in the realm of how people relate to . Her memoir 'Empathy Diaries' received excellent critical reviews.\nWritings.\nIn \"The Second Self\", she writes about how computers are not tools as much as they are a part of our social and psychological lives, writing that technology \"catalyzes changes not only in what we do but in how we think.\" She goes on using Jean Piaget's psychology discourse to discuss how children learn about computers and how this affects their minds. \"The Second Self\" was received well by critics and was praised for being \"a very thorough and ambitious study.\"\nIn \"Life on the Screen\", Turkle discusses how emerging technology, specifically computers, affect the way we think and see ourselves as humans. She presents to us the different ways in which computers affect us, and how it has led us to the now prevalent use of \"cyberspace.\" Turkle suggests that assuming different personal identities in a MUD (i.e. computer fantasy game) may be therapeutic. She also considers the problems that arise when using MUDs. Turkle discusses what she calls women's \"non-linear\" approach to the technology, calling it \"soft mastery\" and \"bricolage\" (as opposed to the \"hard mastery\" of linear, abstract thinking and computer programming). She discusses problems that arise when children pose as adults online.\nTurkle also explores the psychological and societal impact of such \"relational artifacts\" as social robots, and how these and other technologies are changing attitudes about human life and living things generally. One result may be a devaluation of authentic experience in a relationship.\nTogether with Seymour Papert she wrote the influential paper \"Epistemological Pluralism and the Revaluation of the Concrete.\"\nTurkle has written numerous articles on psychoanalysis and culture and on the \"subjective side\" of people's relationships with technology, especially computers. She is engaged in active study of robots, digital pets, and simulated creatures, particularly those designed for children and the elderly as well as in a study of mobile cellular technologies. Profiles of Turkle have appeared in such publications as The New York Times, Scientific American, and Wired Magazine. She is a featured media commentator on the effects of technology for CNN, NBC, ABC, and NPR, including appearances on such programs as Nightline and 20/20.\nTurkle has begun to assess the adverse effects of rapidly advancing technology on human social behavior. \"Alone Together: Why We Expect More from Technology and Less from Each Other\" was published in 2011 and when discussing the topic she speaks about the need to limit the use of popular technological devices because of these adverse effects.\nEarly life and education.\nSherry Turkle was born in Brooklyn on June 18, 1948. After she graduated as a valedictorian from Abraham Lincoln High School in 1965, she began her studies at Radcliffe College, graduating in 1969 with a bachelor's degree in Social Studies. She then obtained a master's degree in sociology in 1973 and a doctorate in Sociology and Personality Psychology in 1976, both from Harvard University. Inspired by her time in France during her undergraduate years, she did her dissertation research in France, \"writing about the relationship between Freudian thought and the modern French revolutionary movements.\" This relationship was also the subject of her first book, \"Psychoanalytic Politics: Jacques Lacan and Freud's French Revolution\". Turkle has been married twice, first to MIT researcher Seymour Papert, and then to consultant Ralph Willard. Both marriages ended in divorce.\n\"The Second Self\".\nIn \"The Second Self\" (1984), Turkle defines the computer as more than just a tool, but part of our everyday personal and psychological lives. She looks at how computers affect the way we look at ourselves and our relationships with others, claiming that technology defines the way we think and act. Turkle's book allows us to view and reevaluate our own relationships with technology.\nIn her process of evaluating our relationships with computers, Turkle interviews children, college students, engineers, AI scientists, hackers and personal computer owners in order to further understand our relationships with computers and how we interact with them on a personal level. The interviews showed that computers are both a part of our selves as well as part of the external world. In this book, Turkle tries to figure out why we think of computers in such psychological terms, how this happens and what this means for all of us.\n\"Life on the Screen\".\nIn \"Life on the Screen\" (1995), Turkle presents a study of how people's use of the computer has evolved over time, and the profound effect that this machine has on its users. The computer, which connects millions of people across the world together, is changing the way we think and see ourselves. Although it was originally intended to serve as a tool to help us to write and communicate with others, it has more recently transformed into a means of providing us with virtual worlds which we can step into and interact with other people. The book discusses how our everyday interactions with computers affect our minds and the way we think about ourselves. In particular, interacting with these virtual worlds, especially through language, can shift a unitary sense of self into one with a multiplicity of identities.\nTurkle also discusses the way our human identity is changing due to the fading boundary between humans and computers, and how people now have trouble distinguishing between humans and machines. It used to be thought that humans were nothing like machines, because humans had feelings and machines did not. However, as technology has improved, computers have become more and more human-like, and these boundaries had to be redrawn. People now compare their own minds to machines, and talk to them freely without any shame or embarrassment. Turkle questions our ethics in defining and differentiating between real life and simulated life.\n\"Alone Together\".\nIn \"Alone Together\" (2011), Turkle explores how technology is changing the way we communicate. In particular, Turkle raises concerns about the way in which genuine, organic social interactions become degraded through constant exposure to illusory meaningful exchanges with artificial intelligence. Underlying Turkle's central argument is the fact that the technological developments which have most contributed to the rise of inter-connectivity have at the same time bolstered a sense of alienation between people. The alienation involves links between social networks favouring those of proper conversations.\nTurkle's main argument in the first part of the book is that our interactions with robots that simulate emotion pose serious threats to our ability to relate to one another properly. Turkle discusses robots that have been designed to interact with humans on an emotional level; she fears that they may then replace other humans and animals in these emotional roles. Turkle is concerned that we often attribute certain qualities to robots that the robots do not in fact possess, and that our emotional interactions with other humans become eroded as a direct result. Turkle's concern is that our appreciation for human interaction may become eroded.\nThe second part of the book examines the nature of online social interactions, and the way in which social media has changed how people, particularly younger people, connect with one another. Turkle argues that because people in interpersonal social situations, particularly young people, are often distracted by their phones, they will pay insufficient attention to one another, creating increasingly shallow relationships. Turkle argues that teenagers' reliance on friends' advice prevents self-reflection, leading to less personal independence.\nTurkle talks about the nature of privacy in the post 9/11 world, arguing that privacy was sacrificed in exchange for safety. Turkle argues that because they have grown up as part of a world in which privacy is regarded as increasingly tenuous, children do not always appreciate the full value of privacy, which in turn causes them to share even more personal details on the web. This further depreciates the value of privacy in a self-perpetuating cycle.\nUsing her 15 year of experience, Turkle uses \"Alone Together\" to explore the question of whether or not technology is bringing quality to our lives. Turkle argues people use technology to escape from reality and emotions, which weakens genuine relationships.\nIn 2011, Turkle was interviewed by Stephen Colbert on The Colbert Report, where she spoke briefly about \"Alone Together\", and the impact that technology has on communication skills.\nTurkle gave a TED talk on the subject of \"Alone Together\" in February 2012, under the title \"Connected, but alone?\"\n\"Reclaiming Conversation\".\n\"Reclaiming Conversation and The Power of Talk in A Digital Age\" (2015) is Turkle's examination of evolving interpersonal and intrapersonal communications. In the preamble, Turkle cites Henry David Thoreau's Walden as providing guidance for the structure of the book: \"I had three chairs in my house; one for solitude, two for friendship, three for society.\" This book is thus divided into three general parts: a single chair for intrapersonal communication, two chairs concerning the importance of conversations in friendships, families and romances, and three chairs for interpersonal communication such as in school, work, and politics. Turkle gathered data from schools, companies, families, and articulates the statistical and psychoanalytic barriers that have forced users to \"sacrifice conversation for mere connection\". This trade-off in interwoven intimacies and apps ultimately withholds the necessary \"face-to-face experiences that are needed for generating authentic connection\".\nThe capacity to interact on a personal or private basis is the cornerstone to empathy, and Turkle argues that loneliness is also essential to this. Paradoxically, Turkle presents the blossoming of technologies role in our reconciliation of lonely experiences and maintaining close social interactions. While access to mobile devices can empower connections with pre-existing relationships, it can also harm the general sense of solitude and ability to meet personal and social standards on a grander scale. The ability to connect through technology then becomes the compromise that chatting online is \"better than nothing\".\nTurkle gave a talk for Google about her book \"Reclaiming Conversation.\"\nAziz Ansari responded to \"Reclaiming Conversation\" by saying, \"In a time in which the ways we communicate and connect are constantly changing, and not always for the better, Sherry Turkle provides a much needed voice of caution and reason to help explain what the f*** is going on.\"\nAwards and honors.\nTurkle is a recipient of a Guggenheim Fellowship, a Rockefeller Humanities Fellowship, the Harvard Centennial Medal, and is a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.\nIn May 2015, Turkle received an https://\nIn June 2016, Turkle received an honorary doctorate degree from Concordia University.\nIn 2018 she was featured among \"America's Top 50 Women In Tech\" by Forbes.\nPersonal life.\nShe was married to Seymour Papert from 1977 to 1985 and Ralph Willard from 1987 to 1998.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "76528", "revid": "32814320", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=76528", "title": "Order of the Arrow", "text": "Honor society of Scouting America\nThe Order of the Arrow (OA) is the honor society of Scouting America, composed of Scouts and Scouters who best exemplify the Scout Oath and Law in their daily lives as elected by their peers. It was founded as a camp fraternity by E. Urner Goodman, with the assistance of Carroll A. Edson, in 1915. Although it began without national approval, it was eventually admitted as an \"Official Experiment\" of Scouting America. In 1948, following an extensive review, it became a program of the organization.\nInducted members, known as \"Arrowmen\" or \"Brothers\" (regardless of gender; as Scouting America and its programs are open to all genders), are organized into local youth-led lodges that harbor fellowship, promote camping, and render service to scout councils and their communities. Each lodge corresponds to a council in the area. Lodges are further broken down into chapters, which correspond to districts within a council. Members wear identifying insignia on their uniforms, most notably the pocket flap that represents their individual lodge and the sash worn at official OA functions. The national organization sponsors several events, awards, and training functions in addition to lodge programming.\nScouting America maintains that the Order of the Arrow is not a secret organization. It instead utilizes the \u201cattractiveness of the unknown\u201d in its ceremonies to create a perception of mystery among non-members. There are three membership levels, each with its own ceremony: Ordeal, Brotherhood, and Vigil Honor. These ceremonies are recognition of a scout's leadership qualities, camping skills, and other Scouting ideals as exemplified by their elected peers. Additionally, \"safeguarded\u201d (privy only to members and approved, legitimately interested adults) symbols and handshakes are used to impart a sense of community. Since the 1980s, concerned parents, Scout leaders, and religious leaders may review the ceremonies through a process set by the OA, and parents can refuse for their child to take part in the ceremony as membership is voluntary.\nThe Order of the Arrow has foundations influenced by Freemasonry and previously used imagery commonly associated with American Indian cultures for its self-invented ceremonies. Native Americans have criticized the OA's various symbols and \"rituals\" as cultural appropriation based on non-Native stereotypes of American Indians. Its Freemason ties have also been source of debate, in spite of its systematic removal of masonic terminology in the 1930s to avoid offending religious groups.\nOrigins.\nThe Order of the Arrow was started as a Camp Fraternity by E. Urner Goodman, newly assigned Director of Treasure Island Scout Reservation on the Delaware River and assistant Camp Director Carroll A. Edson under the name of \"Wimachtendienk Wingolauchsik Witahemui\". It was seen as a way to improve the summer camp experience and to encourage older Scouts to continue attending the summer camp. It was not part of Scouting America at the time. The name was based on the L\u00ebnape dialect.\nIn 1921, the \"known\" lodges organized themselves under a Grand Lodge as inspired by the Freemasons. A new constitution was written and the ceremonies used in the early years were rewritten in 1921. Concern about fraternities excluding some youth was brought up the next year during the Second Biennial Conference of Scout Executives. One attendee, Dr. Tinney of Little Rock, AR stated,\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nGoodman had defended camp fraternities at the same conference and opposed a possible blanket ban on them. At the conclusion of the conference, the Order of the Arrow was adopted as an \"Official Experiment\" of Scouting America.\nThroughout the 1930s, the Order of the Arrow went through a full review. The terminology used by the order was slowly replaced to sound less masonic and more Native American. This was a requirement from Scouting America who wished to not offend the religious groups that represented almost half of their charter organizations at the time and this needed to happen before the OA could be fully integrated into Scouting America.\nBy 1948, two-thirds of Scouting America's councils had OA lodges. That same year, it announced at the 1948 National Order of the Arrow Conference that the Order of the Arrow was integrated as an official part of Scouting America program.\nMembership.\nNearly 100,000 youth and adults are members of the Order of the Arrow as of 2023. Honorary membership was once bestowed in special circumstances, as with Franklin D. Roosevelt and Dwight D. Eisenhower, but this practice was officially discontinued in 1953.\nElections.\nRegistered members of Scouting America must meet a set of requirements before they are placed on the ballot for their unit's election. They must have camped for fifteen nights, be recommended by the unit leader and (for youth) hold the rank of First Class or higher.\nOnce the requirements are met, potential youth Arrowmen are placed on their unit's ballot. The election is then held, with all youth members of the troop voting in secret for scouts who they deem worthy of membership in the OA. Adults who meet the membership requirements must be nominated by the unit committee and approved by the lodge adult selection committee.\nElections to the Order of the Arrow have occasionally been compared to popularity contests. The organization's chairman acknowledged in 2011 that elections were a challenge, and that steps had been taken for adult leaders to make a greater effort to convey the serious nature of OA membership to members of the troop. OA troop representatives who organize an election are asked to read the following statement to the unit:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;An Order of the Arrow election is not a popularity contest. We ask you not to vote for a Scout just because they are your friend, or because they are a good athlete, or because they are older. We ask you to vote for those you believe are best at following the Scout Oath and Law.\nMembership levels.\nThere are three levels of membership in the Order of the Arrow:\nOnce a scout is elected, they are inducted into the order during the Ordeal ceremony. After six months, they become eligible to complete the Brotherhood ceremony, and following two years as a Brotherhood member, an Arrowman may be nominated for the Vigil Honor.\nOrganization.\nThe Order of the Arrow places great emphasis on being a youth-led organization. Only youth under the age 21 are voting members and are eligible to hold elected offices. Professional and volunteer adults are appointed to non-voting advisory positions at the chapter, lodge, and section levels.\nChapters and lodges.\nThe smallest level of organization in the Order of the Arrow is the chapter. The chapter is usually corresponding to a district in the local council. The chapter is led by the elected youth chapter chief, chapter vice chiefs, secretary, and a volunteer adult is appointed as the adviser, the district executive is the professional (staff) adviser. The chapters often hold monthly or weekly meetings together. The next largest unit of the OA is the lodge, which is chartered by a local Scouting America council. The lodge chief is the elected youth leader, the lodge adviser is a Scouting America adult volunteer appointed by the Scout Executive, and the lodge staff adviser is the council Scout executive or his designated council professional Scouter. The lodge youth officers, consisting of the lodge chief, one or more vice chiefs, a secretary, and a treasurer are responsible for organizing and leading the various programs and activities of the lodge. Many lodges have standing committees responsible for ceremonies, service projects, publications, unit elections, camp promotions, and dance teams composed of youth members.\nSections.\nLodges are grouped into sections that are then grouped into regions. The section chief is the elected youth leader, a volunteer adult is appointed as the section adviser, and the area director (or his designate) is the professional (staff) adviser. In addition to the section chief, the section has two additional elected officers. The vice chief and secretary are elected immediately following the election of the section chief at the section's annual business meeting. All sections gather annually at a section conclave held in the late spring or early fall. It is the main duty of the section officers to lead the planning of this weekend with the help of the lodge chiefs in the section.\nLike Scouting America's areas, the Order of the Arrow was formerly organized into four regions, Central, Southern, Northeast, and Western; the boundaries of each OA region correspond with the boundaries of Scouting America's areas. As of 2021, following Scouting America's restructuring of these areas, the OA changed their region boundaries, now having only two. Each region has an elected region chief, a volunteer adult who is appointed as the region chairman to oversee its region Committee, and an appointed professional (staff) adviser, forming a 'Key Three' much like the lodge and chapter system described above. Each region chief is elected by a caucus of the section chiefs from the region at the national planning meeting. Region chief elections are held the day after the election of the national chief and vice chief. The members of the region committee consist of the region chief, the region chair, all national committee members from the region, and other appointed adult volunteers. Each region annually has a gathering of all section officers and advisers. As a region, they are trained in topics relevant to their jobs. Each region also provides opportunities for Order of the Arrow members to go through a National Leadership Seminar, a weekend training course.\nNational leadership.\nThe national chief and the national vice chief are selected by a caucus of the section chiefs at the outset of the Order of the Arrow's national planning meeting. At the national level, the OA is headed by the National Order of the Arrow committee, of which the national chief and national vice chief are voting members. The national adult leadership includes the volunteer chairman and the director, a professional Scouter.\nCeremonies and symbols.\nVarious symbols are used to identify members of the Order of the Arrow. Members are issued a white sash embroidered with a red arrow upon completion of their Ordeal. Arrowmen who achieve Brotherhood and Vigil Honor receive slightly different sashes. Additionally, each lodge produces a pocket flap to be worn by its members. It is sewn permanently to the right-hand shirt pocket while the sash is only used in formal settings.\nThere are four ceremonies following the election of a scout to the Order of the Arrow:\nThe requirements to take part in the ceremonies are public but the content of the ceremonies is considered safeguarded and shared only with legitimately concerned adults.\nCeremonies also utilize the organization's song, commonly referred to by its first line of lyrics as \"Firm Bound in Brotherhood\", and titled \"Order of the Arrow Official Song\" and \"The Order of the Arrow Song\" in the printed music score of official OA publications. It was written in 1921 by OA founder E. Urner Goodman to the tune of the Russian hymn \"God Save the Tsar!\" composed by Alexei Lvov in 1833.\nAwards.\nAwards are separate and distinct from the membership levels of Ordeal and Brotherhood. Awards available through the Order of the Arrow include:\nEvents.\nThe national OA committee also sponsors various national service opportunities, the oldest of which is the National OA Service Corps at the national Scout jamborees, at which Arrowmen have helped with many functions including shows and the Outdoor Adventure Program exhibit.\nHigh Adventure.\nThe Order of the Arrow sponsors service groups to the four National High Adventure Bases that focus on conservation. Inspired by three gentlemen, Edward Pease, Eugene \"Gene\" Schnell and Marty Tschetter, who gathered at a leadership summit at Philmont Scout Ranch in 1979, the Order of the Arrow High Adventure program was established. It originally started with the Order of the Arrow Trail Crew at the Philmont Scout Ranch working to build new trails and repair old ones. This expanded to the Northern Tier National High Adventure Bases with the OA Wilderness Voyage, repairing the portage trails in the Boundary Waters Canoe Area, and then to Florida National High Adventure Sea Base in 2005 with Ocean Adventure, which works to remove invasive species on some of the Keys and promoting and carrying out of the Bleach watch program in the Florida Keys. After the addition of the third High Adventure Base, the Order of the Arrow implemented the OA Triple Crown Award in the summer of 2009, the OA began the OA Canadian Odyssey program which provided service similar to the OA Wilderness Voyage to the Quetico Provincial Park. In 2014, The Summit Bechtel Family National Scout Reserve began hosting the Order of the Arrow Summit Experience which gives service to the New River Gorge National River.\nNational Order of the Arrow Conference.\nThe National Order of the Arrow Conference (NOAC) is a multi-day event which usually takes place on a university campus, bringing together thousands of delegates from OA lodges around the nation for training and activities. NOACs are held every two years, with exceptions made to align the event with significant anniversaries. As a youth-led organization, these national conferences are organized and directed by the elected section and region youth officers, who serve on committees responsible for various conference aspects under the leadership of the conference vice-chief. Events include training programs, competitions in athletics, ceremonies, and cooking, exhibits on OA history, outdoor activities, and camping. There are also opportunities to talk with national leaders, perform service work and trade patches. Evening shows have different themes, including award presentations such as the Distinguished Service Award and other entertainment.\nTraining.\nIn addition to training courses available at a NOAC or section conclave, the OA offers specialized leadership training as weekend events for members: Lodge Leadership Development (LLD), National Leadership Seminars (NLS), and Developing Youth Leadership Conference (DYLC). LLD is a one-day or two-day event conducted by a lodge to train their officers and advisers. NLS's are conducted by regions for lodge officers and advisers. Many lodges send key officers to receive training. Typically, each region schedules three or four NLS weekends annually, at geographically dispersed locations within the region. DYLC is a training event for adults, usually held in conjunction with an NLS and conducted by regions, on the role of advisers in the OA.\nLargely considered the adult equivalent of the NLS program, NLATS's primary objective was to provide advanced training to adults in each lodge. NLATS and NLS usually happened concurrently on the same weekend. The events were planned and executed by a staff of adults. After successful pilots in 2016, the Developing Youth Leadership Conference curriculum began replacing NLATS in early 2017.\nUse of Native American cultures.\nEarly years.\nGoodman and Edson, the founders of the Order of the Arrow, opted to portray what they saw as Native American characteristics \"as a sign of scouting excellence\", and that the imagery, costuming, titles and imitation rituals \"evoked a primitivist exterior Indian Other, vanished from the modern world but still accessible through ritual and its accompanying objects.\" Goodman and Edson established the OA at Treasure Island Scout Reservation as a Scouting honor society \"based on a loose interpretation of\" \"Hiawatha\" and the novel \"The Last of the Mohicans\". Inductions of new OA members at Treasure Island involved OA members meeting around bonfires in \"ritual Indian costume\".\nCriticism.\nIn the later twentieth century and beyond, the Order of the Arrow has been protested and criticized for engaging in cultural appropriation and spreading stereotypes of, and racism against, Native Americans. Protester concerns include OA's imitation of Native American ceremonies, regalia, and artwork they consider to be offensive.\nThe Chief Seattle Council of Scouting America has written that modern ceremonies conducted by each OA lodge are \"influenced by\" the history and traditions of the Native American tribes indigenous to the areas the lodge serves, but use of Native American sacred objects by non-Native groups such as the Boy Scouts has been condemned by Native activists. Mother of former Scouts Ozheebeegay Ikwe writes, \"While native children in residential schools had their culture and language beaten from them, the Boy Scouts were using the language and their version of 'Indian culture' in their OA ceremony.\" She called the OA's use of headdresses, face paint, eagle feathers, and dancing with a pipe, \"downright offensive\". After researching the OA and watching their ceremonies she said, \"Use of these items by Boy Scouts indicates that there is very little understanding of the Native people they claim to admire and respect.\" American anthropologist John H. Moore, an expert on North American Indian ethnology, wrote in an essay published in 1998 that \"of all the institutions in American society, the Boy Scouts of America have probably done the most damage in miseducating the public about Native American cultures...[the] Order of the Arrow annually initiates thousands of boys into the martial, romantic version of Indian culture through ceremonies drawn from the writings of Longfellow and James Fenimoore Cooper\".\nDavid Prochaska, professor in the University of Illinois History Department states the Order of the Arrow is one element that \"exemplifies the much larger phenomenon of 'playing Indian'...Boy Scouts, Eagle Scouts, Order of the Arrow. Order of Red Men. Campfire Girls. Woodcraft. Boston Tea Party. 'White Indians' \u2013 white New Agers as Native American 'wannabes.' ... To pursue the argument a step further, what is 'playing Indian,' 'playing Native,' 'playing an Other,' all about? It is about play, for one thing, in the sense of dressing up, masquerade, the Bakhtinian carnivalesque...It is also about appropriation, in the sense of taking on, assuming an other's identity, taking another's identity. The implication here is replacing one with another, silencing another, speaking for another.\"\nSimon Mayo-Smith, a journalist and citizen of the Oglala Lakota Nation explains the concern of using Native American Headpieces:\n\u201cThe headdress is reserved for our revered elders who, through their selflessness and leadership, have earned the right to wear one. It\u2019s a spiritual garb, not just cultural; it\u2019s not merely an addition to one\u2019s attire. Wearing one, even an imitation headdress, belittles what our elders have spent a lifetime to earn.\u201d\nResponse.\nOn July 23, 2018, the National Order of the Arrow Committee announced that they had received \"many complaints surrounding these ceremonies from various American Indian tribes due to the manner in which they are conducted as well as the inconsistent nature in which they are performed.\" In 2019, the rules were changed: \"Scouts will no longer be allowed to dress up as 'Indians' and incorporate Native American motifs into two of the order's more important ceremonies\", according to the Voice of America, which noted also that \"in spite of complaints from tribes across the country, Scouts continue to dress in 'Redface,' a term some use to describe the wearing of feathers and warpaint by non-Native Americans.\" In 2023, amid a backlash against stereotypes of Native Americans, Scouting America held a survey among its members about whether to eliminate or alter the rituals, including those for the OA.\nOn December 23, 2023, the national Order of the Arrow leadership announced: \"American Indian Activities (dancing, drumming, and crafts) will not be a part of the program at the 2024 National OA Conference.\" And, \"There is not a single entity that speaks for the 574 federally recognized tribes/Indian nations across the United States and it is impossible for us to gain consensus amongst all the tribes/Indian nations. As a result, national-level American Indian programming is not appropriate.\"\nIn 2024, the organization announced that issuance of American Indian Vigil Honor names will stop. Native American-based competitions, training and other programs will be discontinued at the section and national level in 2025. The practice will remain open at the local level until January 1, 2026. At that time, \"only lodges that have a formal relationship established with a state or federally recognized tribe in their area may engage in American Indian programming.\" Additional guidance on this item was distributed in December 2024 and additional training will be issued throughout 2025.\nInfluence of Freemasonry.\nAs evident in the history of the Order of the Arrow, the organization started with a large influence of Freemasonry. In the 1930s, it underwent a replacement of the Masonic vocabulary to avoid offending religious groups, including the Catholic Church and some Protestant denominations who have long-standing concerns with Freemasonry. Since then, the OA has grown to be an important part of Scouting America throughout the 20th and 21st centuries. However, the debate about its relationship with Freemasonry is not over.\nThose who put forward this idea believe that the Order of the Arrow is still today a Masonic organization and has not shed its Masonic nature. Several articles have been published since the 1990s expending on this idea. They point to the history of the OA and the current similarities that persist between Freemasonry and the present-day Order of the Arrow in its organization, secret ceremonies, and other rituals:\nAcknowledgement of ties.\nThe Order of the Arrow has not addressed directly the question of its present ties to Freemasonry. But on its official website, the OA does not shy away from its past by using the old Masonic terminology similar in a historical context and acknowledging that this terminology may well have come from the Masonic fraternal system:\n\"In 1921 Wimachtendienk, W.W. (a common way at the time of referring to what we know as the Order of the Arrow) was ready to have a national structure. Patterned similar to the Freemasons, it was decided that each lodge would become a member of the Grand Lodge.\"\n\"The usage of the term \u201cGrand Lodge\u201d appears to have come from the Masonic fraternal system that also calls their national organization the Grand Lodge.\"\nIt also acknowledges that it was required to change this terminology in the 1930s:\n\"As part of the agreement made by the OA National Executive Committee with Scouting America to become an official part of the Boy Scout program the OA agreed to change certain terminology effective January 1, 1935 (although not disseminated to local lodges until April 23, 1935). Scouting America was concerned about heavy reliance on Masonic fraternal terms in the Order. So the term \u201clodge\u201d which is what Masons call their local groupings was replaced with the word \u201ctribe\u201d. Instead of Unami Lodge and Owasippe Lodge, they became Unami Tribe and Owasippe Tribe. Likewise the Masons use of the term \u201cGrand\u201d to describe their highest governing body was changed to \u201cNational\u201d. Thus the OA's Grand Lodge would become known as the National Tribe and the Grand Chieftain would become known as the National Chieftain. Similarly, the term \u201cDegree\u201d became \u201cHonor\u201d and the term \u201cPassword\u201d became \u201cAdmonition\u201d. The term \u201cManitou\u201d referring to a deity was eliminated from ceremonies, this being done to satisfy religious groups concerns.\"\nAddressing concerns from adults.\nThe OA also recognizes and respects the right of any parent, Scout leader and religious leader to have questions about the OA and its safeguarded ceremonies prior to a scout joining the organization. It provides a formal process to answer these questions with the lodge adviser or his designee. If questions remain after this meeting, the adults will be permitted to read the current ceremony text used in the Ordeal to make an informed decision. As scouts are minors, parents have the final say to allow or disallow their child to join the organization. Some exceptions can also be granted to allow parents to attend the ceremony itself under certain conditions.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Then, one or more clusters are chosen at random and everyone within the chosen cluster is sampled.\nUsing all the sample elements in all the selected clusters may be prohibitively expensive or unnecessary. Under these circumstances, multistage cluster sampling becomes useful. Instead of using all the elements contained in the selected clusters, the researcher randomly selects elements from each cluster. Constructing the clusters is the first stage. Deciding what elements within the cluster to use is the second stage. The technique is used frequently when a complete list of all members of the population does not exist and is inappropriate.\nIn some cases, several levels of cluster selection may be applied before the final sample elements are reached. For example, household surveys conducted by the Australian Bureau of Statistics begin by dividing metropolitan regions into 'collection districts' and selecting some of these collection districts (first stage). The selected collection districts are then divided into blocks, and blocks are chosen from within each selected collection district (second stage). Next, dwellings are listed within each selected block, and some of these dwellings are selected (third stage). This method makes it unnecessary to create a list of every dwelling in the region and necessary only for selected blocks. In remote areas, an additional stage of clustering is used, in order to reduce travel requirements.\nAlthough cluster sampling and stratified sampling bear some superficial similarities, they are substantially different. In stratified sampling, a random sample is drawn from all the strata, where in cluster sampling only the selected clusters are studied, either in single- or multi-stage.\nAdvantages \nDisadvantages\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He started at the Selig Polyscope Company and eventually moved to Keystone Studios, where he worked with Mabel Normand and Harold Lloyd as well as with his nephew, Al St. John. He also mentored Charlie Chaplin, Monty Banks and Bob Hope, and brought vaudeville star Buster Keaton into the movie business. Arbuckle was one of the most popular silent stars of the 1910s and one of the highest-paid actors in Hollywood, signing a contract in 1920 with Paramount Pictures for $1 million a year (equivalent to $\u00a0million in 2024).\nArbuckle was the defendant in three widely publicized trials between November 1921 and April 1922 for the rape and manslaughter of actress Virginia Rappe. Rappe had fallen ill at a party hosted by Arbuckle at San Francisco's St. Francis Hotel in September 1921, and died four days later. A friend of Rappe accused Arbuckle of raping and accidentally killing her. The first two trials resulted in hung juries, but the third trial acquitted Arbuckle. The third jury took the unusual step of giving Arbuckle a written statement of apology for his treatment by the justice system.\nDespite Arbuckle's acquittal, the scandal has mostly overshadowed his legacy as a pioneering comedian. At the behest of Adolph Zukor, president of Famous Players\u2013Lasky, his films were banned by motion picture industry censor Will H. Hays after the trial, and he was publicly ostracized. Zukor was faced with the moral outrage of various groups such as the Lord's Day Alliance, the powerful Federation of Women's Clubs and even the Federal Trade Commission to curb what they perceived as Hollywood debauchery run amok and its effect on the morals of the general public. While Arbuckle saw a resurgence in his popularity immediately after his acquittal, Zukor decided he had to be sacrificed to keep the movie industry out of the clutches of censors and moralists. Hays lifted the ban within a year, but Arbuckle only worked sparingly through the 1920s. In their deal, Keaton promised to give him 35% of the Buster Keaton Comedies Co. profits. He later worked as a film director under the pseudonym William Goodrich. He was finally able to return to acting, making short two-reel comedies in 1932\u201333 for Warner Bros.\nArbuckle died in his sleep of a heart attack in 1933 at age 46, reportedly on the day that he signed a contract with Warner Bros. to make a feature film.\nEarly life.\nRoscoe Arbuckle was born on March 24, 1887, in Smith Center, Kansas, one of nine children of Mary E. Gordon and William Goodrich Arbuckle. He weighed in excess of at birth and his father believed that he was illegitimate, as both parents had slim builds. Consequently, he named him after Senator Roscoe Conkling of New York, a notorious philanderer whom he despised. The birth was traumatic for Mary and resulted in chronic health problems that contributed to her death eleven years later.\nArbuckle was nearly two when his family moved to Santa Ana, California. He first performed on stage with Frank Bacon's company at age 8 during their performance in Santa Ana. Arbuckle enjoyed performing and continued on until his mother's death in 1898, when he was 11. Arbuckle's father had always treated him harshly and now refused to support him, so he got work doing odd jobs in a hotel. He was in the habit of singing while he worked, and a professional singer heard him and invited him to perform in an amateur talent show. The show consisted of the audience judging acts by clapping or jeering, with bad acts pulled off the stage by a shepherd's crook. Arbuckle sang, danced, and did some clowning around, but he did not impress the audience. He saw the crook emerging from the wings and somersaulted into the orchestra pit in obvious panic. The audience went wild, and he won the competition and began a career in vaudeville.\nCareer.\nIn 1904, Sid Grauman invited Arbuckle to sing in his new Unique Theater in San Francisco, beginning a long friendship between the two. He then joined the Pantages Theatre Group touring the West Coast and in 1906 played the Orpheum Theater in Portland, Oregon, in a vaudeville troupe organized by Leon Errol. Arbuckle became the main act and the group took their show on tour.\nOn August 6, 1908, Arbuckle married Minta Durfee (1889\u20131975), the daughter of Charles Warren Durfee and Flora Adkins. Durfee starred in many early comedy films, often with Arbuckle. As a couple, they appeared mismatched, as Minta was short and petite while Arbuckle tipped the scales at 300\u00a0lbs (136\u00a0kg). Arbuckle then joined the Morosco Burbank Stock vaudeville company and went on a tour of China and Japan, returning in early 1909.\nArbuckle began his film career with the Selig Polyscope Company in July 1909 when he appeared in \"Ben's Kid\". He appeared sporadically in Selig one-reelers until 1913, moved briefly to Universal Pictures, and became a star in producer-director Mack Sennett's \"Keystone Cops\" comedies. Although his large size was undoubtedly part of his comedic appeal, Arbuckle was self-conscious about his weight and refused to use it to get \"cheap\" laughs like getting stuck in a doorway or chair.\nArbuckle was a talented singer. After famed operatic tenor Enrico Caruso heard him sing, he urged the comedian to \"give up this nonsense you do for a living, with training you could become the second greatest singer in the world.\"\nScreen comedian.\nDespite his physical size, Arbuckle was remarkably agile and acrobatic. Mack Sennett, when recounting his first meeting with Arbuckle, noted that he \"skipped up the stairs as lightly as Fred Astaire\" and that he \"without warning went into a feather light step, clapped his hands and did a backward somersault as graceful as a girl tumbler\". His comedies are noted as rollicking and fast-paced, have many chase scenes, and feature sight gags. Arbuckle was fond of the \"pie in the face\", a comedy clich\u00e9 that has come to symbolize silent-film-era comedy itself. The earliest known pie thrown in film was in the June 1913 Keystone one-reeler \"A Noise from the Deep\", starring Arbuckle and frequent screen partner Mabel Normand.\nIn 1914, Paramount Pictures made the then unheard-of offer of US$1,000 a day plus twenty-five percent of all profits and complete artistic control to make movies with Arbuckle and Normand. The movies were so lucrative and popular that in 1918 they offered Arbuckle a three-year, $3\u00a0million contract (equivalent to $\u00a0million in 2024).\nBy 1916, Arbuckle was experiencing serious health problems. An infection that developed on his leg became a carbuncle so severe that doctors considered amputation. Although Arbuckle was able to keep his leg, he was prescribed morphine against the pain; he would later be accused of being addicted to it. Following his recovery, Arbuckle started his own film company, Comique, in partnership with Joseph Schenck. Although Comique produced some of the best short pictures of the silent era, Arbuckle transferred his controlling interest in the company to Buster Keaton in 1918 and accepted Paramount's $3\u00a0million offer to make up to 18 feature films over three years.\nArbuckle disliked his screen nickname. \"Fatty\" had also been Arbuckle's nickname since school; \"It was inevitable\", he said. Fans also called Roscoe \"The Prince of Whales\" and \"The Balloonatic\". However, the name \"Fatty\" identifies the character that Arbuckle portrayed on-screen (usually a naive hayseed), not Arbuckle himself. When Arbuckle portrayed a female, the character was named \"Miss Fatty\", as in the film \"Miss Fatty's Seaside Lovers\". Arbuckle discouraged anyone from addressing him as \"Fatty\" off-screen, and when they did so his usual response was, \"I've got a name, you know.\"\nScandal.\nOn Monday, September 5, 1921 (Labor Day), Arbuckle took a break from his hectic film schedule and, despite suffering second-degree burns to both buttocks from an on-set accident, drove to San Francisco with two friends, Lowell Sherman and Fred Fishback. The three checked into three rooms at the St. Francis Hotel: 1219 for Arbuckle and Fishback to share, 1221 for Sherman, and 1220 designated as a party room. Several women were invited to the suite. During the carousing, a 30-year-old aspiring actress named Virginia Rappe was found seriously ill in room 1219 and was examined by the hotel doctor, who concluded that her symptoms were mostly caused by intoxication and administered morphine to calm her. Rappe was not hospitalized until two days after the incident.\nAt the hospital, Rappe's companion at the party, Bambina Maude Delmont, told a doctor that Arbuckle had raped Rappe. The doctor examined Rappe but found no evidence of rape. She died Friday, September 9, 1921 from peritonitis caused by a ruptured bladder. Rappe suffered from chronic urinary tract infections, a condition that liquor can irritate dramatically.\nThe day after Rappe's death, Arbuckle was arrested and arraigned on charges of murder and held without bail. A grand jury also indicted him on manslaughter of the first degree on September 13, 1921.\nDelmont told police that Arbuckle had raped Rappe. The police concluded that the impact of Arbuckle's overweight body on top of Rappe caused her bladder to rupture. At a press conference, Rappe's manager, Al Semnacher, accused Arbuckle of using a piece of ice to simulate sex with Rappe that led to her injuries. By the time that the story was reported in newspapers, the object had evolved into a Coca-Cola or champagne bottle rather than a piece of ice. In fact, witnesses testified that Arbuckle rubbed the ice on Rappe's stomach to ease her abdominal pain. Arbuckle denied any wrongdoing. Delmont later admitted to plotting to extort money from him.\nArbuckle was regarded by those who knew him closely as a good-natured man who was shy around women, and he had been described as \"the most chaste man in pictures.\" However, studio executives, fearing negative publicity by association, warned Arbuckle's industry friends and fellow actors (many of whose careers they controlled) not to publicly defend him. Charlie Chaplin told reporters that he could not believe that Arbuckle was guilty, having known him since they both worked at Keystone in 1914. Chaplin \"knew Roscoe to be a genial, easy-going type who would not harm a fly.\" Buster Keaton issued a public statement in support of Arbuckle that resulted in a mild reprimand from Keaton's studio. Actor William S. Hart, who had never met or worked with Arbuckle, issued a number of damaging public statements presuming Arbuckle's guilt. Arbuckle later wrote a premise for a film parodying Hart as a thief, bully and wifebeater. Keaton purchased the premise, and the resulting film, \"The Frozen North\", was released in 1922, almost a year after the scandal first emerged. Keaton cowrote, directed and starred in the film, and Hart refused to speak to Keaton for many years afterward.\nThe prosecutor, San Francisco district attorney Matthew Brady, an intensely ambitious man who planned to run for governor, made public pronouncements of Arbuckle's guilt and pressured witnesses to make false statements. Brady at first featured Delmont as his star witness during the indictment hearing. The defense obtained a letter from Delmont admitting to a plan to extort payment from Arbuckle. Delmont's constantly changing testimony effectively ended any chance of the case proceeding to trial. Ultimately, the judge found no evidence of rape. After hearing testimony from party guest Zey Prevon that Rappe said \"Roscoe hurt me\" on her deathbed, the judge decided that Arbuckle could be charged with first-degree murder. Brady had originally planned to seek the death penalty, but the charge was later reduced to manslaughter.\nAfter nearly three weeks in jail he was released on bail of $5,000.\nTrials.\nArbuckle's trial was a major media event. The story was fueled by yellow journalism, with many newspapers portraying Arbuckle as a gross lecher who used his weight to overpower innocent girls. William Randolph Hearst's nationwide newspaper chain exploited the situation with exaggerated and sensationalized stories. Hearst was gratified by the profits that he accrued during the Arbuckle scandal, and he allegedly said that it had \"sold more newspapers [...] than when the \"Lusitania\" went down.\" Morality groups called for Arbuckle to be sentenced to death.\nFirst trial.\nThe trial began on November 14, 1921 in the San Francisco city courthouse. Arbuckle hired as his lead defense counsel Gavin McNab, a competent local attorney. The principal witness was Prevon. At the beginning of the trial, Arbuckle told his estranged wife Minta Durfee that he had not harmed Rappe. Durfee believed him and appeared regularly in the courtroom to support him. Public feeling was so negative that shots were fired at Durfee as she entered the courthouse.\nBrady's first witnesses during the trial included model Betty Campbell, who attended the party and testified that she saw Arbuckle with a smile on his face hours after the alleged rape occurred. Another witness, hospital nurse Grace Hultson, testified that it was very likely that Arbuckle raped Rappe and bruised her body in the process. Criminologist Dr. Edward Heinrich testified that fingerprints on the hallway door proved that Rappe had tried to flee, but that Arbuckle had stopped her by placing his hand over hers. Dr. Arthur Beardslee, the hotel doctor who had examined Rappe, testified that an external force seemed to have damaged the bladder. However, during cross-examination, Campbell revealed that Brady had threatened to charge her with perjury if she did not testify against Arbuckle. Dr. Heinrich's claim to have found fingerprints was cast into doubt after McNab produced a maid from the St. Francis Hotel who testified that she had thoroughly cleaned the room before the investigation took place. Dr. Beardslee admitted that Rappe had never mentioned being assaulted while he was treating her. McNab coaxed Hultson to admit that the rupture of Rappe's bladder could have been the result of cancer and that the bruises could have been caused by the heavy jewelry that Rappe was wearing that evening.\nOn November 28, Arbuckle testified as the defense's final witness and was reported to be simple, direct and unflustered under both direct and cross-examination. In his testimony, Arbuckle claimed that Rappe (whom he testified to have known for five or six years) entered the party room (1220) around noon that day, and that sometime afterward he retreated to his room (1219) to change clothes after Mae Taub, daughter-in-law of Billy Sunday, asked him for a ride into town. In his room, Arbuckle discovered Rappe in the bathroom vomiting into the toilet. He claimed that Rappe had told him that she felt ill and asked to lie down, and that he carried her into the bedroom and asked a few of the party guests to help treat her. When Arbuckle and a few of the guests entered the room again, they found Rappe on the floor near the bed tearing at her clothing and experiencing violent convulsions. To calm Rappe, they placed her in a bathtub of cool water. Arbuckle and Fischbach then took her to room 1227 and called the hotel manager and doctor. At this point all those present believed that Rappe was just very drunk, including the hotel doctors. Assuming that Rappe's condition would improve if she slept, Arbuckle drove Taub into town.\nThe prosecution presented medical descriptions of Rappe's bladder as evidence that she had suffered from an illness. In his testimony, Arbuckle denied that he had any knowledge of Rappe's illness. During cross-examination, assistant district attorney Leo Friedman aggressively grilled Arbuckle about Arbuckle's refusal to call a doctor when he found Rappe sick and argued that Arbuckle had refused because he knew of Rappe's illness and saw a perfect opportunity to rape and kill her. Arbuckle calmly maintained that he did not physically hurt or sexually assault Rappe during the party, and he also stated that he had never made any inappropriate sexual advances against any woman in his life. After more than two weeks of testimony with 60 prosecution and defense witnesses, including 18 doctors who testified about Rappe's illness, the defense rested. On December 4, 1921, the jury returned five days later deadlocked after nearly 44 hours of deliberation with a 10\u20132 not-guilty verdict, and a mistrial was declared.\nArbuckle's attorneys later concentrated on juror Helen Hubbard, who had told other jurors that she would vote guilty \"until hell freezes over.\" She had refused to examine the exhibits or read the trial transcripts, having already decided on Arbuckle's guilt in the courtroom. Hubbard's husband was a lawyer with connections to the district attorney's office, and he expressed surprise that she was not challenged during the \"voir dire\" process. Some of the jurors revealed that they believed Arbuckle to be guilty, but not beyond a reasonable doubt. During the deliberations, some jurors joined Hubbard in voting to convict, but all but one eventually changed their vote. Researcher Joan Myers suggests that Arbuckle's defense team targeted Hubbard as a villain because there had been a great deal of media attention on women serving in juries, a practice that had been legalized only four years earlier. Myers also records Hubbard's account of the jury foreman's attempts to pressure her to change her vote. While Hubbard offered explanations on her vote whenever challenged, Thomas Kilkenny, the other juror who voted guilty, remained silent and quickly faded from the media spotlight after the trial ended.\nSecond trial.\nThe second trial began on January 11, 1922 with a new jury but with the same legal defense, prosecution and presiding judge as those of the previous trial. The same evidence was presented, but this time, witness Zey Prevon testified that Brady had forced her to lie. Another witness who testified during the first trial, a former studio security guard named Jesse Norgard, testified that Arbuckle had once offered him a cash bribe in exchange for the key to Rappe's dressing room but that Norgard refused. Norgard claimed that Arbuckle stated that he wanted the key to play a joke on Rappe. During cross-examination, Norgard's testimony was impugned when he was revealed to be an ex-convict under indictment for sexually assaulting an eight-year-old girl, and was seeking a sentence reduction from Brady in exchange for his testimony. In contrast to the first trial, Rappe's history of promiscuity and heavy drinking was detailed. The second trial also discredited some major evidence such as the identification of Arbuckle's fingerprints on the hotel bedroom door. Heinrich disowned his testimony from the first trial and stated that the fingerprint evidence was likely faked. The defense was so confident that Arbuckle would be acquitted that they did not call him to testify, and McNab did not deliver a closing argument to the jury. However, some jurors interpreted the refusal to permit Arbuckle to testify as a sign of guilt. After five days and more than 40 hours of deliberation, the jury returned on February 3, deadlocked with a 10\u20132 majority in favor of conviction, resulting in another mistrial.\nThird trial.\nBy the time of Arbuckle's third trial, his films had been banned and newspapers had been filled for the past seven months with stories of Hollywood orgies, murder and sexual perversion. Delmont was touring the country performing one-woman shows based on her involvement with the case and lecturing on the evils of Hollywood.\nThe third trial began on March 13, 1922, and McNab took a forceful approach, attacking the prosecution's case with long and aggressive examination and cross-examination of each witness. McNab also introduced more evidence about Rappe's lurid past and medical history. The prosecution's case was weakened because Prevon, a key witness, was out of the country after fleeing police custody and unable to testify. As in the first trial, Arbuckle testified as the final witness and maintained his denial of any wrongdoing. During closing statements, McNab reviewed the flaws in the case and attacked Brady for believing Delmont's outlandish charges, a woman whom McNab described as \"the complaining witness who never witnessed.\" The jury began deliberations April 12 and took only six minutes to return with a unanimous not-guilty verdict. Five of those minutes were spent writing a formal statement of apology to Arbuckle for subjecting him to the ordeal, a dramatic and unusual gesture. The jury statement read:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Acquittal is not enough for Roscoe Arbuckle. We feel that a great injustice has been done him. We feel also that it was only our plain duty to give him this exoneration, under the evidence, for there was not the slightest proof adduced to connect him in any way with the commission of a crime. He was manly throughout the case and told a straightforward story on the witness stand, which we all believed. The happening at the hotel was an unfortunate affair for which Arbuckle, so the evidence shows, was in no way responsible. We wish him success and hope that the American people will take the judgment of fourteen men and woman who have sat listening for thirty-one days to evidence, that Roscoe Arbuckle is entirely innocent and free from all blame.\nSome experts later concluded that Rappe's bladder may have ruptured as a result of an abortion procedure that she may have undergone shortly before the party. However, by that time, her organs had been destroyed and it was no longer possible to test her for pregnancy. Because alcohol was consumed at the party, Arbuckle pled guilty to one count of violating the Volstead Act and was ordered to pay a $500 fine (). At the time of his acquittal, he owed more than $700,000 (equivalent to $\u00a0million in 2024) in legal fees to his attorneys for the three criminal trials, and he was forced to sell his house and all of his cars to pay some of the debt.\nAftermath.\nFollowing Arbuckle's arrest, hundreds of exhibitors withdrew his films from distribution.\nThe scandal and trials greatly damaged Arbuckle's popularity among the general public. In spite of the acquittal and the apology, his reputation was not restored and the effects of the scandal continued. Will H. Hays, who served as the head of the newly formed Motion Pictures Producers and Distributors of America censor board, cited Arbuckle as an example of Hollywood's poor morals. On April 18, 1922, six days after Arbuckle's acquittal, Hays issued a lifetime ban that would prohibit Arbuckle from film work. Hays also requested that all showings and bookings of Arbuckle's films be canceled, and exhibitors complied. In December of the same year, under public pressure, Hays rescinded the ban. However, Arbuckle remained unable to secure work as an actor.\nMost exhibitors still declined to show Arbuckle's films, several of which are now considered lost. Paramount withdrew his latest film \"Crazy to Marry\" after only a brief release, and shelved two features he had already completed: \"Leap Year\" and \"The Fast Freight\". The latter films were ultimately released only in Europe, far away from the scandalmongers in America, and recouped at least part of their production costs. In March 1922, with Arbuckle's films banned, Buster Keaton signed an agreement to award Arbuckle 35% of all future profits from his production company Buster Keaton Comedies, hoping to ease Arbuckle's financial situation.\nIn November 1923, Minta Durfee filed for divorce from Arbuckle, charging grounds of desertion. The divorce was granted the following January. They had been amicably separated since 1921. After a brief reconciliation, Durfee again filed for divorce in December 1924. Arbuckle married Doris Deane on May 16, 1925.\nArbuckle tried returning to filmmaking, but industry resistance to distributing his films continued to linger after his acquittal. He retreated into alcoholism. In the words of his first wife, \"Roscoe only seemed to find solace and comfort in a bottle\". Keaton attempted to help Arbuckle by employing him for his films. Arbuckle wrote the story for a Keaton short titled \"Day Dreams\" (1922) and allegedly directed scenes in Keaton's \"Sherlock Jr.\" (1924), but it is unclear how much of Arbuckle's footage remained in the film's final cut. In 1925, Carter DeHaven's short \"Character Studies\", filmed before the scandal, was released, featuring Arbuckle along with Keaton, Harold Lloyd, Rudolph Valentino, Douglas Fairbanks and Jackie Coogan. The same year in \"Photoplay\"'s August issue, James R. Quirk wrote: \"I would like to see Roscoe Arbuckle make a comeback to the screen. ... The American nation prides itself upon its spirit of fair play. We like the whole world to look upon America as the place where every man gets a square deal. Are you sure Roscoe Arbuckle is getting one today? I'm not.\"\nPseudonym.\nEventually, Arbuckle worked as a director under the pseudonym of William Goodrich, his father's first and middle name. Keaton, a frequent punster, later claimed that the name was derived from the satirical alias \"Will B. Good\".\nBetween 1924 and 1932, Arbuckle directed a number of comedy shorts under the pseudonym for Educational Pictures that featured lesser-known comics of the day. Louise Brooks, who played the ingenue in \"Windy Riley Goes Hollywood\" (1931), told of her experiences working with Arbuckle:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;He made no attempt to direct this picture. He just sat in his director's chair like a dead man. He had been very nice and sweetly dead ever since the scandal that ruined his career. But it was such an amazing thing for me to come in to make this broken-down picture, and to find my director was the great Roscoe Arbuckle. Oh, I thought he was magnificent in films. He was a wonderful dancer\u2014a wonderful ballroom dancer, in his heyday. It was like floating in the arms of a huge doughnut\u2014really delightful.\nAmong the more visible directorial projects under the Goodrich pseudonym was the Eddie Cantor feature \"Special Delivery\" (1927), which was released by Paramount and costarred William Powell and Jobyna Ralston. His highest-profile project was arguably \"The Red Mill\", also released in 1927, a Marion Davies vehicle. In 1930 he served as an uncredited gag writer for the Wheeler and Woolsey military comedy \"Half Shot at Sunrise\".\nRoscoe Arbuckle's Plantation Caf\u00e9.\nArbuckle and Dan Coombs, one of Culver City's first mayors, reopened the Plantation Club near the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer studios on Washington Boulevard as Roscoe Arbuckle's Plantation Caf\u00e9 on August 2, 1928. By 1930, Arbuckle sold his interest and it became known as George Olsen's Plantation Caf\u00e9, later the Plantation Trailer Court and then Foreman Phillips County Barn Dance.\nSecond divorce and third marriage.\nIn 1929, Doris Deane sued for divorce from Arbuckle in Los Angeles, charging desertion and cruelty. On June 21, 1932, Roscoe married Addie Oakley Dukes McPhail (later Addie Oakley Sheldon, 1905\u20132003) in Erie, Pennsylvania.\nBrief comeback and death.\nIn 1932, Arbuckle signed a contract with Warner Bros. to star under his own name in a series of six two-reel comedies to be filmed at the Vitaphone studios in Brooklyn, New York. These six short films constitute the only samples of Arbuckle's voice, which recorded in a pleasant second-tenor range. Silent-film comedian Al St. John (Arbuckle's nephew) and actors Lionel Stander and Shemp Howard appeared with Arbuckle. The film \"How've You Bean?\" features grocery-store gags reminiscent of Arbuckle's 1917 short \"The Butcher Boy\", with vaudeville comic Fritz Hubert as his assistant, dressed like Buster Keaton. The Vitaphone shorts were very successful in the US, although when Warner Bros. attempted to release the first one (\"Hey, Pop!\") in the United Kingdom, the British Board of Film Censors cited the ten-year-old scandal and refused to grant an exhibition certificate.\nOn June 28, 1933, Arbuckle had finished filming \"In the Dough\", the last of the Vitaphone two-reelers (four of which had already been released). The next day, he signed a contract with Warner Bros. to star in a feature-length film. That night, he met with friends to celebrate his first wedding anniversary and the new contract when he reportedly said: \"This is the best day of my life.\" He suffered a heart attack later that night and died in his sleep at the age of 46. His widow Addie requested that his body be cremated according to Arbuckle's wish.\nLegacy.\nMany of Arbuckle's films, including the feature \"The Life of the Party\" (1920), survive only as worn prints with foreign-language intertitles. As with most American films produced during the silent era, little or no effort was made to preserve original negatives and prints during Hollywood's first two decades, making most films that included him lost media or lost films. However, it is likely that due to the reputation Arbuckle received around the death of Virginia Rappe, that many studios wished to avoid any negative backlash and purposely destroyed any surviving films in which he had a starring role.\nBy the early 21st century, some of Arbuckle's short subjects (particularly those co-starring Chaplin or Keaton) had been restored, released on DVD, and even screened theatrically. His early influence on American slapstick comedy is widely recognized.\nFor his contributions to the film industry, in 1960, some 27 years after his death, Arbuckle was awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame located at 6701 Hollywood Boulevard.\nIn popular culture.\nNeil Sedaka refers to Arbuckle, along with Charlie Chaplin, Buster Keaton, Stan Laurel, and Oliver Hardy in his 1971 song \"Silent Movies\", as heard on his \"Emergence\" album.\nThe James Ivory film \"The Wild Party\" (1975) has been repeatedly but incorrectly cited as a film dramatization of the Arbuckle\u2013Rappe scandal. In fact it is loosely based on the 1926 poem by Joseph Moncure March. In this film, James Coco portrays a heavy-set silent film comedian named Jolly Grimm whose career is on the skids, but who is desperately planning a comeback. Raquel Welch portrays his mistress, who ultimately goads him into shooting her. This film was loosely based on the misconceptions surrounding the Arbuckle scandal, yet it bears almost no resemblance to the documented facts of the case.\nIn Ken Russell's 1977 biopic \"Valentino\", Rudolph Nureyev as a pre-movie star Rudolph Valentino dances in a nightclub before a grossly overweight, obnoxious, and hedonistic celebrity called \"Mr. Fatty\" (played by William Hootkins), a caricature of Arbuckle rooted in the public view of him created in popular press coverage of the Rappe rape trial. In the scene, Valentino picks up starlet Jean Acker (played by Carol Kane) off a table in which she is sitting in front of Fatty and dances with her, enraging the spoiled star, who becomes apoplectic.\nAustralian band The Fauves's 1993 debut album \"Drive Through Charisma\" ends with a song called \"Arbuckle at Glenrowan\", which imagines Arbuckle visiting the town of Glenrowan, Victoria where bushranger Ned Kelly was captured in the year 1880.\nBefore his death in 1997, comedian Chris Farley expressed interest in starring as Arbuckle in a biography film. According to the 2008 biography \"The Chris Farley Show: A Biography in Three Acts\", Farley and screenwriter David Mamet agreed to work together on what would have been Farley's first dramatic role. In 2007, director Kevin Connor planned a film, \"The Life of the Party\", based on Arbuckle's life. It was to star Chris Kattan and Preston Lacy. However, the project was shelved. Like Farley, comedians John Belushi and John Candy also considered playing Arbuckle, but each of them died before a biopic was made. Farley's film was signed with Vince Vaughn as his co-star.\nIn April and May 2006, the Museum of Modern Art in New York City mounted a 56-film, month-long retrospective of all of Arbuckle's known surviving work, running the entire series twice.\nArbuckle is the subject of a 2004 novel titled \"I, Fatty\" by author Jerry Stahl. \"The Day the Laughter Stopped\" by David Yallop and \"Frame-Up! The Untold Story of Roscoe \"Fatty\" Arbuckle\" by Andy Edmonds are other books on Arbuckle's life. The 1963 novel \"Scandal in Eden\" by Garet Rogers is a fictionalized version of the Arbuckle scandal.\nFatty Arbuckle's was an American-themed restaurant chain in the UK named after Arbuckle.\nThe 2009 novel \"Devil's Garden\" is based on the Arbuckle trials. The main character in the story is Dashiell Hammett, a Pinkerton detective in San Francisco at the time of the trials.\nNOFX's 2012 album \"Self Entitled\" has a song called \"I, Fatty\" about Arbuckle.\nThe 2021 French graphic novel \"Fatty : le premier roi d'Hollywood\", by Nadar and Julien Frey, portrays the period from Arbuckle's early days in Hollywood to his death.\nThe character Orville Pickwick is based on Arbuckle in Damien Chazelle's 2022 film \"Babylon\", played by Troy Metcalf.\nIn \"Curb Your Enthusiasm\"'s Season 12 Episode 8, \"The Colostomy Bag,\" Larry David in discussion with Conan O'Brien claims that Arbuckle attacked a stranger with a beer bottle after being spoken to in public.\nDuring the third season of \"Hacks\", a biopic about Arbuckle becomes a central part of the plot starting with episode 7, \"The Deborah Vance Christmas Spectacular.\" In the episode, Christopher Lloyd plays a fictional grandson of Arbuckle's (in real life Arbuckle had no children).\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Lingala has 20 million native speakers and about another 20 million second-language speakers, for an approximate total of 40 million speakers. A significant portion of both Congolese diasporas speaks Lingala in their countries of immigration like Belgium, France or the United States.\nHistory.\nBefore 1880, Bobangi was an important trade language on the western sections of the Congo River, between Stanley Pool (Kinshasa) and the confluence of the Congo and Ubangi rivers (Republic of Congo and Democratic Republic of Congo). When the first Europeans and their West- and East-African troops started founding state posts for the Belgian king along this river section in the early 1880s, they noticed the widespread use and prestige of Bobangi. They attempted to learn it, but only cared to acquire an imperfect knowledge of it, a process that gave rise to a new, strongly restructured variety, called \"the trade language\", \"the language of the river\", or \"Bobangi-pidgin\", among other names. In 1884, Europeans introduced this restructured variety of Bobangi in the state post Bangala Station to communicate with local Congolese, some of whom had second-language knowledge of original Bobangi, and with the Congolese from more remote areas whom missionaries and colonials had been relocating to the station by force. The \"language of the river\" was therefore soon renamed \"Bangala\", a label the Europeans had since 1876 also been using as a convenient, but erroneous and non-original ethnic name for all Congolese of that region.\nAround 1901\u20132, CICM missionaries started a project to \"purify\" the \"Bangala\" language by cleansing it from the \"impure\", pidginlike features it had acquired when it emerged out of Bobangi in the early 1880s.\nAround and shortly after 1901, a number of both Catholic and Protestant missionaries working in the western and northern Congo Free State, independently of one another but in strikingly parallel terms, judged that Bangala as it had developed out of Bobangi was too \"pidgin like\", \"too poor\" a language to function as a proper means of education and evangelization. Each of them set out on a program of massive corpus planning, aimed at actively \"correcting\" and \"enlarging\" Bangala from above [...]. One of them was the Catholic missionary Egide De Boeck of the Congregatio Immaculati Cordis Mariae (CICM, commonly known as \"the Missionaries of Scheut\" or \"Scheutists\"), who arrived in Bangala Station \u2013 Nouvelle Anvers in 1901. Another one was the Protestant missionary Walter H. Stapleton [...], and a third one the Catholic L\u00e9on Derikx of the Premonstratensian Fathers [...]. By 1915, De Boeck's endeavors had proven to be more influential than Stapleton's, whose language creative suggestions, as the Protestant missionaries' conference of 1911 admitted, had never been truly implemented [...]. Under the dominance of De Boeck's work, Derikx's discontinued his after less than 10 years.\nLingala's importance as a vernacular has since grown with the size and importance of its main centers of use, Kinshasa and Brazzaville; with its use as the lingua franca of the armed forces; and with the popularity of soukous music.\nName.\nAt first the language the European pioneers and their African troops had forged out of Bobangi was called \"the river language\", \"the trade language\", and other volatile names. Beginning in 1884, it was called \"Bangala\", due to its introduction in Bangala Station. After 1901, Catholic missionaries of CICM, also called the Congregation of Scheutists, proposed to rename the language \"Lingala\". It took some decades for this to be generally accepted both by colonials and the Congolese. The name \"Lingala\" first appears in writing in a 1901-2 publication by the CICM missionary \u00c9gide De Boeck. This name change was accepted in western and northwestern Congo, and in other countries where the language was spoken, but not in northeastern Congo, where the variety of the language spoken locally is still called \"Bangala\".\nBobangi-Lingala relationship.\nLinguistically, Lingala is a dialect or variant of Bobangi, a popular or commercial Bobangi, that is, a Bobangi lingua franca spoken by non-native speakers. Lingala has also been referred to by the following names: \"bad Bobangi\", \"Sabir of Bobangi\", \"deformed and mixed Bobangi\", \"Bobangi of treaties\", \"patois of Bobangi and Kilolo\", and \"the new language of the Bobangi\".\nCharacteristics and usage.\nLingala is a Bantu language of Central Africa with roots in the Bobangi language, which provided most of its lexicon and grammar. In its basic vocabulary, Lingala also borrows from other languages, such as Kikongo varieties, Ubangian languages, Swahili, French, Portuguese, English, and various African languages (note local and foreign interaction with Krumen).\nIn practice, the extent of borrowing varies widely with speakers of different regions (commonly among young people), and during different occasions.\nFrench \nSpanish\nPortuguese\nEnglish\nVariation.\nThe Lingala language can be divided into several regiolects and sociolects. The major regional varieties are northwestern Lingala, Kinshasa Lingala and Brazzaville Lingala.\nLiterary Lingala (\"lingala litt\u00e9raire\" or \"lingala classique\" in French) is a standardized form used mostly in education and news broadcasts on state-owned radio or television and in Roman Catholic religious services, It is taught as a subject at some educational levels. It is historically associated with the work of the Catholic Church, the Belgian CICM missionaries in particular. It has a seven-vowel system () with an obligatory tense-lax vowel harmony. It also has a full range of morphological noun prefixes with mandatory grammatical agreement system with subject\u2013verb, or noun\u2013modifier for each of class. It is largely used in formal functions and in some forms of writing. Most native speakers of Spoken Lingala and Kinshasa Lingala consider it incomprehensible.\nNorthwestern (or \"Equateur\") Lingala is the product of the (incomplete) internalization by Congolese of the prescriptive rules the CICM missionaries intended when designing Literary Lingala. The northwest is a zone where the CICM missionaries strongly supported the network of schools.\nSpoken Lingala (called \"lingala parl\u00e9\" in French) is the variety mostly used in Lingalaphones' day-to-day lives. It has a full morphological noun prefix system, but the agreement system in the noun phrase is laxer than the literary variety's. There is a five-vowel system and no vowel harmony. Spoken Lingala is largely used in informal functions, and the majority of Lingala songs use spoken Lingala. Modern spoken Lingala is influenced by French; French verbs, for example, may be \"lingalized\", adding Lingala inflection prefixes and suffixes: \"acomprenaki te\" or \"acomprendraki te\" (\"he did not understand\", using the French word \"comprendre\") instead of classic Lingala \"as\u00edmbaki nt\u00edna te\" (literally: \"s/he grasped/held the root/cause not\"). These French influences are more prevalent in Kinshasa and indicate an erosion of the language as education in French becomes accessible to more of the population. There are pronunciation differences between \"Catholic Lingala\" and \"Protestant Lingala\", for example nzala/njala (\"hunger\").\n\"Lingala ya Bayankee\" (sometimes called \"Yank\u00e9\") is a sociolect widely used in Kinshasa, e.g., by street youth, street vendors, criminal gangs and homeless children. \"Langila\" is a little-studied language game (or ludic practice) musicians initially created shortly after 2000 that is increasingly used in social media and sites of cultural production.\nPhonology.\nVowels.\nVowel harmony.\nLingala words show vowel harmony to some extent. The close-mid vowels and normally do not mix with the open-mid vowels and in words. For example, the words \"nd\u0254b\u0254\" 'fishhook' and \"ndobo\" 'mouse trap' are found, but not \"*nd\u0254bo\" or \"*ndob\u0254\".\nVowel shift.\nThe Lingala spoken in Kinshasa shows a vowel shift from to , leading to the absence of the phoneme in favor of . The same occurs with and , leading to just . So in Kinshasa, a native speaker will say \"mb\u00f3te\" as , compared to the more traditional pronunciation, .\nConsonants.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nPrenasalized consonants.\nThe prenasalized stops formed with a nasal followed by a voiceless plosive are allophonic to the voiceless plosives alone in some variations of Lingala.\nThe prenasalized voiced occlusives, , do not vary.\nTones.\nLingala is a tonal language. Tone is a distinguishing feature in minimal pairs, e.g.: \"mutu\" (human being) and \"mut\u00fa\" (head), or kokoma (to write) and kok\u00f3ma (to arrive). There are two main tones, low and high, and two less common ones: starting high, dipping low, and ending high, all within the same vowel sound, e.g., \"m\u01d0so\" (eyes); and starting low, rising high, and ending low, e.g.,\u00a0\"b\u00f4ng\u00f3\" (therefore).\nTonal morphology.\nTense morphemes carry tones.\nGrammar.\nNoun class system.\nAkin to all Bantu languages, Lingala has a noun class system in which nouns are classified according to the prefixes they bear and the prefixes they trigger in sentences. The table below shows Lingala's noun classes ordered according to the numbering system widely used in descriptions of Bantu languages.\nIndividual classes pair up to form singular/plural pairs, sometimes called genders. There are seven genders. The singular classes 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9 take their plural forms from classes 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, respectively. Additionally, many household items found in class 9 take a class 2 prefix (\"ba\") in the plural: \"l\u00fatu\" \u2192 \"bal\u00fatu\" 'spoon', \"m\u00e9sa\" \u2192 \"bam\u00e9sa\" 'table', \"s\u00e1ni\" \u2192 \"bas\u00e1ni\" 'plate'. Words in class 11 usually take a class 10 plural. Most words from class 14 (abstract nouns) do not have a plural counterpart.\nClass 9 and 10 have a nasal prefix, which assimilates to the following consonant. Thus, the prefix shows up as 'n' on words that start with \"t\" or \"d\", e.g. \"ntaba\" 'goat', but as 'm' on words that start with \"b\" or \"p\" (e.g. \"mb\u00edsi\" 'fish'). There is also a prefixless class 9a and 10a, exemplified by \"s\u00e1nz\u00e1\" \u2192 \"s\u00e1nz\u00e1\" 'moon(s) or month(s)'. Possible ambiguities are resolved by context.\nNoun class prefixes show up not only on the noun itself, but as markers throughout a sentence. In the sentences below, the class prefixes are underlined. (There is a special verbal form 'a' of the prefix for class 1 nouns.)\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Interlinear/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Interlinear/styles.css\" /&gt;\nTo a certain extent, noun class allocation is semantically governed. Classes 1/2, as in all Bantu languages, mainly contain words for human beings; similarly, classes 9/10 contain many words for animals. In other classes, semantical regularities are mostly absent or obscured by many exceptions.\nVerb inflections and morphology.\nVerbal extensions.\nFour morphemes modify verbs. They are added to a verb root in the following order:\nTense inflections.\nThe first tone segment affects the subject part of the verb; the second attaches to the semantic morpheme attached to its root.\nWriting system.\nLingala is more a spoken than a written language, and has several different writing systems, most of them ad hoc. As literacy in Lingala tends to be low, its popular orthography is very flexible and varies among the two republics. Some orthographies are heavily influenced by French; influences include a double S, \"ss\", to transcribe [s] (in the Republic of the Congo); \"ou\" for [u] (in the Republic of the Congo); i with trema, \"a\u00ef\", to transcribe or ; e with acute accent, \"\u00e9\", to transcribe [e]; \"e\" to transcribe , o with acute accent, \u00f3, to transcribe or sometimes [o] in opposition to o transcribing [o] or ; i or y can both transcribe [j]. The allophones are also found as alternating forms in the popular orthography; \"sango\" is an alternative to \"nsango\" (information or news); \"nyonso\", \"nyoso\", \"nionso\", \"nioso\" (every) are all transcriptions of \"ny\u0254\u0301ns\u0254\".\nIn 1976, the \"Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Za\u00efroise des Linguistes\" (Zairian Linguists Society) adopted a writing system for Lingala, using the open e and the open o to write the vowels and , and sporadic usage of accents to mark tone, though the limitation of input methods prevents Lingala writers from easily using the and and the accents. For example, it is almost impossible to type Lingala according to that convention with a common English or French keyboard. The convention of 1976 reduced the alternative orthography of characters but did not enforce tone marking. The lack of consistent accentuation is lessened by contextual disambiguation.\nThe popular orthographies are often more simplified and ambiguous than the academic-based ones. Many Lingala books, papers, the translation of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Internet forums, newsletters, and major websites such as Google's Lingala do not use the Lingala-specific characters \u025b and \u0254. Tone marking is found in most literary works.\nAlphabet.\nThe Lingala alphabet has 35 letters and digraphs. Each digraph has a specific place in the alphabet; for example, \"mza\" comes before \"mba\", because the digraph \"mb\" follows the letter \"m\". The letters \"r\" and \"h\" are rare but present in borrowed words. Accents indicate the tones as follows:\nSample.\nThe Lord's Prayer (Catholic version)\nTat\u00e1 wa b\u00eds\u00f3, ozala o likol\u00f3,\nbato bak\u00famisa Nk\u00f3mb\u00f3 ya ,\nbandima bokonzi bwa , mpo elingo ,\nbas\u00e1l\u00e1 yang\u00f3 o ns\u00e9,\nlok\u00f3la bakosalaka o likol\u00f3\nP\u00e9sa b\u00eds\u00f3 bil\u00e9i bya ,\nl\u00edmbisa mab\u00e9 ma b\u00eds\u00f3,\nlok\u00f3la b\u00eds\u00f3 tokolimbisaka ban\u00edng\u00e1.\nS\u00e1lisa b\u00eds\u00f3 tondima mas\u025b\u0301nginy\u00e1 t\u00ea,\nmpe b\u00edkisa b\u00eds\u00f3 o mab\u00e9.\nNa bokonzi,\nnguy\u00e1 na nkembo,\no bileko o binso s\u00e9k\u00f4.\nAmen.\nThe Lord's Prayer (Protestant version used in Ubangi-Mongala region)\nTat\u00e1 na b\u00eds\u00f3 na likol\u00f3,\nnk\u00f3mb\u00f3 na ezala mosanto,\nbokonzi na eya,\nmokano na esalama na ns\u00e9\nlokola na likol\u00f3.\nP\u00e9sa b\u00eds\u00f3 kwanga ekok\u00ed .\nL\u00edmbisa b\u00eds\u00f3 nyongo na b\u00eds\u00f3,\npelamoko elimbisi b\u00eds\u00f3 bango nyongo na bango.\nKamba b\u00eds\u00f3 kati na komekama t\u00ea,\nkasi b\u00edkisa b\u00eds\u00f3 na mab\u00e9.\nMpo ete na ezal\u00ed bokonzi,\nna nguy\u00e1, na nkembo,\nlobiko na lobiko.\nAmen.\n\"Bato nyonso na mbotama bazali nzomi pe bakokani na limemya pe makoki.

It premiered in New York City on 16 December 1893. It is one of the most popular of all symphonies. In older literature and recordings, this symphony was \u2013 as for its first publication \u2013 numbered as Symphony No. 5. \nThe symphony was completed in the building that now houses the Bily Clocks Museum in Spillville, Iowa.\nAstronaut Neil Armstrong took a tape recording including the \"New World Symphony\" along during the Apollo 11 mission, the first Moon landing, in 1969. \nInstrumentation.\nThis symphony is scored for the following orchestra:\nForm.\nA typical performance usually lasts around 40 minutes. The work is in four movements:\nI. Adagio \u2013 Allegro molto.\nThe movement is written in sonata form and begins with an introductory melody in Adagio. This melodic outline also appears in the third movement of Dvo\u0159\u00e1k's String Quintet No. 3 in E\u266d major and his Humoresque No. 1. The exposition is based on three thematic subjects. The first in E minor is notable for its announcing and responsive phrases. The second is in G minor and undergoes a transformation such that it resembles a Czech polka. The exposition's closing theme in G major is known for being similar to the African-American spiritual \"Swing Low, Sweet Chariot\". The development primarily focuses on the main and closing themes, and the recapitulation consists of a repetition of the main theme as well as a transposition of the second and closing themes up a semitone. The movement is concluded with a coda, with the main theme stated by the brass above an orchestral tutti.\nII. Largo.\nThe second movement, written in ternary form, is introduced by a harmonic progression of chords in the wind instruments. Beckerman interprets these chords as a musical rendition of the narrative formula \"Once upon a time\". Then a solo cor anglais (English horn) plays the famous main theme in D-flat major accompanied by muted strings. Dvo\u0159\u00e1k was said to have changed the theme from clarinet to cor anglais as it reminded him of the voice of Harry Burleigh. The movement's middle section contains a passage in C\u266f minor evoking a nostalgic and desolate mood which eventually leads into a funeral march above pizzicato steps in the basses. It is followed by a quasi-scherzo that incorporates this movement's theme as well as the first movement's main and closing themes. The Largo is concluded with the soft return of the main theme and introductory chords.\nIII. Molto vivace.\nThe movement is a scherzo written in ternary form, with influences from Henry Wadsworth Longfellow's \"The Song of Hiawatha\". The stirring rhythm of the first part is interrupted by a trio middle section. The first part is then repeated, followed by an echo in the coda of the first movement's main theme.\nIV. Allegro con fuoco.\nThe final movement is also written in sonata form. After a brief introduction, the horns and trumpets declare the movement's main theme against sharp chords played by the rest of the orchestra. The second theme is then presented by the clarinet above tremolos in the strings. The development not only works with these two themes but also recalls the main themes of the first and second movements and a fragment of the Scherzo. Following the recapitulation which begins in the unexpected key of G minor but later corrects itself back to the original key, the movement reaches its climax in the coda, in which materials from the first three movements are reviewed for a final time while the Picardy third is expanded after the orchestra triumphantly plays a \"modally altered\" plagal cadence. The main theme, especially its occurrence in bar 321, bears a close resemblance to the opening theme of the \"Hans Heiling Overture\" by Heinrich Marschner.\nInfluences.\nDvo\u0159\u00e1k was interested in Native American music and the African-American spirituals he heard in North America. While director of the National Conservatory he encountered an African-American student, Harry T. Burleigh, who sang traditional spirituals to him. Burleigh, later a composer himself, said that Dvo\u0159\u00e1k had absorbed their \"spirit\" before writing his own melodies. Dvo\u0159\u00e1k stated:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;I am convinced that the future music of this country must be founded on what are called Negro melodies. These can be the foundation of a serious and original school of composition, to be developed in the United States. These beautiful and varied themes are the product of the soil. They are the folk songs of America and your composers must turn to them.\nThe symphony was commissioned by the New York Philharmonic, and premiered on 16 December 1893, at Carnegie Hall conducted by Anton Seidl. A day earlier, in an article published in the \"New York Herald\" on 15 December 1893, Dvo\u0159\u00e1k further explained how Native American music influenced his symphony:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;I have not actually used any of the [Native American] melodies. I have simply written original themes embodying the peculiarities of the Indian music, and, using these themes as subjects, have developed them with all the resources of modern rhythms, counterpoint, and orchestral colour.\nIn the same article, Dvo\u0159\u00e1k stated that he regarded the symphony's second movement as a \"sketch or study for a later work, either a cantata or opera ... which will be based upon Longfellow's \"Hiawatha\"\" (Dvo\u0159\u00e1k never actually wrote such a piece). He also wrote that the third movement scherzo was \"suggested by the scene at the feast in \"Hiawatha\" where the Indians dance\".\nIn 1893, a newspaper interview quoted Dvo\u0159\u00e1k as saying \"I found that the music of the negroes and of the Indians was practically identical\", and that \"the music of the two races bore a remarkable similarity to the music of Scotland\". Most historians agree that Dvo\u0159\u00e1k is referring to the pentatonic scale, which is typical of each of these musical traditions.\nIn a 2008 article in \"The Chronicle of Higher Education\", prominent musicologist Joseph Horowitz states that African-American spirituals were a major influence on Dvo\u0159\u00e1k's music written in North America, quoting him from an 1893 interview in the \"New York Herald\" as saying, \"In the negro melodies of America I discover all that is needed for a great and noble school of music.\" Dvo\u0159\u00e1k did, it seems, borrow rhythms from the music of his native Bohemia, as notably in his Slavonic Dances, and the pentatonic scale in some of his music written in North America from African-American and/or Native American sources. Statements that he borrowed melodies are often made but seldom supported by specifics. One verified example is the song of the Scarlet Tanager in the Quartet. Michael Steinberg writes that a flute solo theme in the first movement of the symphony resembles the spiritual \"Swing Low, Sweet Chariot\". Leonard Bernstein averred that the symphony was truly multinational in its foundations.\nDvo\u0159\u00e1k was influenced not only by music he had heard but also by what he had seen in America. He wrote that he would not have composed his American pieces as he had if he had not seen America. It has been said that Dvo\u0159\u00e1k was inspired by the \"wide open spaces\" of America, such as prairies he may have seen on his trip to Iowa in the summer of 1893. Notices about several performances of the symphony include the phrase \"wide open spaces\" about what inspired the symphony and/or about the feelings it conveys to listeners.\nDvo\u0159\u00e1k was also influenced by the style and techniques used by earlier classical composers including Beethoven and Schubert. The falling fourths and timpani strokes in the \"New World Symphony\"'s Scherzo movement evoke the Scherzo of Beethoven's Choral Symphony (Symphony No. 9). The use of quotations of prior movements in the symphony's final movement is reminiscent of Beethoven quoting prior movements in the opening Presto of the Choral Symphony's final movement.\nReception.\nAt the premiere in Carnegie Hall, the end of every movement was met with thunderous clapping and Dvo\u0159\u00e1k felt obliged to stand up and bow. This was one of the greatest public triumphs of Dvo\u0159\u00e1k's career. When the symphony was published, several European orchestras soon performed it. Alexander Mackenzie conducted the London Philharmonic Society in the first London performance on 21 June 1894. Clapham says the symphony became \"one of the most popular of all time\" and at a time when the composer's main works were being welcomed in no more than ten countries, this symphony reached the rest of the musical world and has become a \"universal favorite\". As of 1978, it had been performed more often \"than any other symphony at the Royal Festival Hall, London\" and is in \"tremendous demand in Japan\".\nIn the UK, the largo became familiar to the general public after its use in a 1973 television advert directed by Ridley Scott for the Hovis bakery. \n\"Goin' Home\".\nThe theme from the Largo was adapted into the spiritual-like song \"Goin' Home\" (often mistakenly considered a folk song or traditional spiritual) by Dvo\u0159\u00e1k's pupil William Arms Fisher, who wrote the lyrics in 1922.\nFootnotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

His testimony led to passage of the Hepburn Act of 1906 which eased railroad fares for western shippers.\nPresident Teddy Roosevelt appointed him to the National Conservation Commission in 1908, and it was Mackenzie, then manager of the Brazil Land, Cattle and Packing Company, with whom Roosevelt stayed when he visited Brazil in 1913.\nBiography.\nMacKenzie was born near Tain, Ross-shire, Scotland, where he attended parish school and graduated from the Tain Royal Academy in 1869. He served in a law office and in the British Linen Bank, then as factor for Sir Charles Ross's estate at Balnagown Castle. He married Isabella Stronach MacBain in 1876 and fathered five children with her. Among these was his son, David G. (Dode) MacKenzie, who, in December 1909, was shot in LeBeau, South Dakota, while also working for Matador. \nHe sailed to the United States in 1885 to accept an offer to manage the Prairie Land and Cattle Company in Trinidad, Colorado.

He frequently employed rhythms and other aspects of the folk music of Moravia and his native Bohemia, following the Romantic era nationalist example of his predecessor Bed\u0159ich Smetana. Dvo\u0159\u00e1k's style has been described as \"the fullest recreation of a national idiom with that of the symphonic tradition, absorbing folk influences and finding effective ways of using them\", and Dvo\u0159\u00e1k has been described as \"arguably the most versatile... composer of his time\".\nDvo\u0159\u00e1k displayed his musical gifts at an early age, being a talented violin student. The first public performances of his works were in Prague in 1872 and, with special success, in 1873, when he was 31 years old. Seeking recognition beyond the Prague area, he submitted scores of works including symphonies to competitions in Germany and Austria. He did not win a prize until 1874, with Johannes Brahms on the jury of the Austrian State Competition. In 1877, after his third win, Brahms recommended Dvo\u0159\u00e1k to his publisher, Simrock, who commissioned what became the \"Slavonic Dances\", Op. 46. The sheet music's high sales and critical reception led to his international success. A London performance of Dvo\u0159\u00e1k's Stabat Mater in 1883 led to many other performances in the United Kingdom, the United States, and eventually Russia in March 1890. The Seventh Symphony was written for London in 1885.\nIn 1892, Dvo\u0159\u00e1k became the director of the National Conservatory of Music of America in New York City. While in the United States, Dvo\u0159\u00e1k wrote his two most successful orchestral works: the Symphony \"From the New World\", which spread his reputation worldwide, and his Cello Concerto, one of the most highly regarded of all cello concerti. On a summer holiday in Spillville, Iowa, in 1893, Dvo\u0159\u00e1k also wrote his most famous piece of chamber music, his twelfth String Quartet in F major, Op. 96, the \"American\". While he remained at the Conservatory for a few more years, pay cuts and an onset of homesickness led him to return to Bohemia in 1895.\nAll of Dvo\u0159\u00e1k's ten operas, except his first, have librettos in Czech and were intended to convey the Czech national spirit, as were some of his choral works. By far the most successful of the operas is \"Rusalka\", premiered in 1901. Among his smaller works, the seventh \"Humoresque\" and the song \"Songs My Mother Taught Me\" are also widely performed and recorded. The Dvo\u0159\u00e1k Prague International Music Festival is a major series of concerts held annually to celebrate Dvo\u0159\u00e1k's life and works.\nBiography.\nEarly life.\nDvo\u0159\u00e1k was born in Nelahozeves near Prague, in the Austrian Empire, and was the eldest son of Franti\u0161ek Dvo\u0159\u00e1k (1814\u20131894) and his wife, Anna, n\u00e9e Zde\u0148kov\u00e1 (1820\u20131882). Franti\u0161ek worked as an innkeeper, a professional player of the zither, and a butcher. Anna was the daughter of Josef Zden\u011bk, the bailiff of the Prince of Lobkowicz. Anna and Franti\u0161ek married on 17 November 1840. Dvo\u0159\u00e1k was the first of 14 children, eight of whom survived infancy. Dvo\u0159\u00e1k was baptized as a Roman Catholic in the village's church of St. Andrew. Dvo\u0159\u00e1k's years in Nelahozeves nurtured his strong Christian faith and the love for his Bohemian heritage that so strongly influenced his music. In 1847, Dvo\u0159\u00e1k entered primary school and was taught to play violin by his teacher Joseph Spitz. He showed early talent and skill, playing in a village band and in church. Franti\u0161ek was pleased with his son's gifts. At the age of 13, through the influence of his father, Dvo\u0159\u00e1k was sent to Zlonice to live with his uncle Anton\u00edn Zden\u0115k in order to learn the German language. His first composition, the \"Forget-Me-Not Polka in C (Polka pomn\u011bnka)\" was written possibly as early as 1855.\nDvo\u0159\u00e1k took organ, piano, and violin lessons from his German-language teacher Anton\u00edn Liehmann. Liehmann also taught the young boy music theory and introduced him to the composers of the time; Dvo\u0159\u00e1k had much regard for Liehmann despite his teacher's violent temper. Liehmann was the church organist in Zlonice and sometimes let Anton\u00edn play the organ at services. Dvo\u0159\u00e1k took further organ and music theory lessons at \u010cesk\u00e1 Kamenice with Franz Hanke, who encouraged his musical talents even further and was more sympathetic. At the age of 16, through the urging of Liehmann and Zden\u0115k, Franti\u0161ek allowed his son to become a musician, on the condition that the boy should work toward a career as an organist. After leaving for Prague in September 1857, Dvo\u0159\u00e1k entered the city's Organ School, studying singing with Josef Zvona\u0159, theory with , and organ with Joseph Foerster. The latter was not only a professor at the Prague Conservatory, but also a composer for the organ; his son Josef Bohuslav Foerster became a better known composer. Dvo\u0159\u00e1k also took an additional language course to improve his German and worked as an \"extra\" violist in numerous bands and orchestras, including the orchestra of the St. Cecilia Society. Dvo\u0159\u00e1k graduated from the Organ School in 1859, ranking second in his class. He applied unsuccessfully for a position as an organist at Prague St. Henry's Church, but remained undaunted in pursuing a musical career.\nIn 1858, he joined Karel Komz\u00e1k's orchestra, with whom he performed in Prague's restaurants and at balls. The high professional level of the ensemble attracted the attention of Jan Nepomuk Ma\u00fdr, who engaged the whole orchestra in the Bohemian Provisional Theatre Orchestra. Dvo\u0159\u00e1k played viola in the orchestra beginning in 1862. Dvo\u0159\u00e1k could hardly afford concert tickets, and playing in the orchestra gave him a chance to hear music, mainly operas. In July 1863, Dvo\u0159\u00e1k played in a program devoted to the German composer Richard Wagner, who conducted the orchestra. Dvo\u0159\u00e1k had had \"unbounded admiration\" for Wagner since 1857. In 1862, Dvo\u0159\u00e1k had begun composing his first string quartet. In 1864, Dvo\u0159\u00e1k agreed to share the rent of a flat located in Prague's \u017di\u017ekov district with five other people, who also included violinist Mo\u0159ic Anger and Karel \u010cech, who later became a singer. In 1866, Ma\u00fdr was replaced as chief conductor by Bed\u0159ich Smetana. Dvo\u0159\u00e1k was making about $7.50 a month. The constant need to supplement his income pushed him to give piano lessons.\nMarriage and children.\nIt was through these piano lessons that he met his future wife, Anna. He originally fell in love with Anna's sister Josef\u00edna \u010cerm\u00e1kov\u00e1, who was his pupil and colleague from the Provisional Theatre. It was apparently for Josef\u00edna that he composed the song-cycle \"Cypresses\". However, she never returned Dvo\u0159\u00e1k's affections and later married another man, Count Wenzel Robert von Kaunitz (1848-1913).\nIn 1873 Dvo\u0159\u00e1k married Josefina's younger sister, Anna \u010cerm\u00e1kov\u00e1. They had nine children, of whom several died in infancy. The children were: Otakar (1874\u20131877), Josefa (1875-1875), R\u016f\u017eena (1876\u20131877), Ot\u00fdlie (1878-1905), Anna (1880-1923), Magdalena (1881-1952), Anton\u00edn (1883-1956), Otakar (1885-1961) and Aloisie (1888-1967). In 1898 Ot\u00fdlie, a composer in her own right, married Dvorak's student, the composer Josef Suk, but died only seven years later. In 1960, shortly before his own death, the younger Otakar wrote a book about his father.\nComposer and organist.\nDvo\u0159\u00e1k called his String Quintet in A minor (1861) his Opus 1, and his First String Quartet (1862) his Opus 2, although the chronological Burghauser Catalogue numbers these as B.6 and B.7, showing five earlier compositions without opus numbers. In the early 1860s, Dvo\u0159\u00e1k also made his first symphonic attempts, some of which he self-critically burned. The manuscript of a symphony in C minor without opus number, B.9, composed in 1865, was preserved. This symphony has come to be numbered as Dvo\u0159\u00e1k's First (see under \"Works\"). His first composing attempts passed without critical reception or public performances. His compositions up through 1870, according to the Burghauser Catalogue either had no known premieres, or were premiered in 1888 or later. For example, the Third String Quartet, B.18, was written in about 1869 but first published posthumously in 1964 and premiered in 1969. In 1870, he composed his first opera, \"Alfred\", over the course of five months from May to October. Its overture was first publicly performed as late as 1905, and the full opera only in 1938.\nIn 1871, Dvo\u0159\u00e1k left the Provisional Theatre orchestra to have more time for composing. Up through 1871 Dvo\u0159\u00e1k only gave opus numbers up to 5 among his first 26 compositions. The first press mention of Anton\u00edn Dvo\u0159\u00e1k appeared in the \"Hudebn\u00ed listy\" journal in June 1871, and the first publicly performed composition was the song \"Vzpom\u00edn\u00e1n\u00ed\" (\"Reminiscence\", October 1871, musical evenings of Jan Ludev\u00edt Proch\u00e1zka. The opera \"The King and the Charcoal Burner\" was returned to Dvo\u0159\u00e1k from the Provisional Theatre and said to be unperformable. Its overture was premiered in 1872 in a Philharmonic concert conducted by Bed\u0159ich Smetana, but the full opera with the original score was performed once in 1929, and not heard again until a concert performance in September 2019 at the Dvo\u0159\u00e1k Prague International Music Festival. Clapham says Dvo\u0159\u00e1k realized he had gone to \"extremes in attempting to follow the example of Wagner\". In 1873\u201374, he reset \"the \"King and Charcoal Burner\" libretto entirely afresh, in a totally different manner\", without using \"anything from the ill-fated earlier version\". The alternate opera, called \"King and Charcoal Burner II\", B.42, was premiered in Prague in 1874.\nOn leaving the National Theater Orchestra after his marriage, Dvo\u0159\u00e1k secured the job of organist at St. Vojt\u011bch, also called St. Adalbert's, Church in Prague under Josef Foerster, his former teacher at the Organ School. The job paid \"a mere pittance\", but it was \"a welcome addition for the young couple\". Despite these circumstances, Dvo\u0159\u00e1k still managed to compose a substantial body of music around this time.\nIn November 1872, Dvo\u0159\u00e1k's Piano Quintet in A major, Op. 5, was performed in Prague, by a \"splendid team of players\" organized by Proch\u00e1zka. It was his first piece played in a concert. In March 1873, his Czech patriotic cantata \"The Heirs of the White Mountain\" was performed by the Prague Hlahol Choral Society of 300 singers (conducted by his friend and supporter Karel Bendl) to a warm response from both audience and critics, making it an \"unqualified success\". Dvo\u0159\u00e1k's compositions were first coming to be recognized in Prague.\nWhen Dvo\u0159\u00e1k turned 33 in 1874, he was still almost unknown as a composer outside Prague and the surrounding area. That year, he applied for and won the Austrian State Prize (\"Stipendium\") for composition, awarded in February 1875 by a jury consisting of the critic Eduard Hanslick, Johann Herbeck, director of the State Opera, and Johannes Brahms. It seems that Brahms had only recently joined the jury, as he was not on it during the calendar year of 1874, according to Hanslick. Hanslick had first-hand knowledge, as a continuing member of the jury\n(from at least 1874 to 1877). Nevertheless, Brahms had time and opportunity to appreciate Dvo\u0159\u00e1k's 1874 submission. Leon Botstein says that the jury's purpose was \"to award financial support to talented composers in need\" in the Austro-Hungarian Empire. The jury received a \"massive submission\" from Dvo\u0159\u00e1k: \"fifteen works including two symphonies, several overtures and a song cycle\". Brahms was \"visibly overcome\" by the \"mastery and talent\" of Dvo\u0159\u00e1k. The two symphonies were Dvo\u0159\u00e1k's third and fourth, both of which had been premiered in Prague in the spring of 1874.\nClapham gives the official report for the 1874 prize, saying Dvo\u0159\u00e1k was a relatively impoverished music teacher who \"has submitted 15 compositions, among them symphonies, which display an undoubted talent...The applicant... deserves a grant to ease his straitened circumstances and free him from anxiety in his creative work.\" It says he had not yet owned a piano. Before being married, he had lodged with five other men, one of whom owned a small \"spinet\" piano.\nIn 1875, the year his first son was born, Dvo\u0159\u00e1k composed his second string quintet, his 5th Symphony, Piano Trio No. 1, and Serenade for Strings in E. He again entered but this time did not win the Austrian State Prize. He did win it in 1876, and finally felt free to resign his position as an organist. In 1877, he wrote the \"Symphonic Variations\", and Ludev\u00edt Proch\u00e1zka conducted its premiere in Prague.\nInternational reputation.\nDvo\u0159\u00e1k entered the Austrian Prize competition again in 1877, submitting his Moravian Duets and other music \u2013 possibly his Piano Concerto. He did not learn the outcome until December. Then, he received a personal letter from the music critic Eduard Hanslick, who had also been on the juries awarding the prizes. The letter not only notified Dvo\u0159\u00e1k that he had again won the prize, but made known to him for the first time that Brahms and Hanslick had been on the jury. The letter conveyed an offer of friendly assistance of the two in making Dvo\u0159\u00e1k's music known outside his Czech motherland. Within the month December 1877, Dvo\u0159\u00e1k wrote his String Quartet No. 9 in D minor and dedicated it to Brahms. Both Brahms and Hanslick had been much impressed by the Moravian Duets, and Brahms recommended them to his publisher, Simrock, who published them with success. Having in mind Brahms's well-received Hungarian Dances, Simrock commissioned Dvo\u0159\u00e1k to write something of the same nature. Dvo\u0159\u00e1k submitted his Slavonic Dances, Op. 46 in 1878, at first for piano four hands, but when requested by Simrock, also in an orchestral version. These were an immediate and great success. On 15 December 1878, the leading music critic Louis Ehlert published a review of the Moravian Duets and Slavonic Dances in the Berlin \"Nationalzeitung\", saying that the \"Dances\" would make their way \"round the world\" and \"a heavenly naturalness flows through this music\". \"There was a run on the German music shops for the dances and duets of this hitherto... unknown composer.\" The dances were played in 1879 in concerts in France, England, and the United States. Later Simrock requested further Slavonic Dances, which Dvo\u0159\u00e1k supplied in his Op. 72, 1886.\nIn 1879 Dvo\u0159\u00e1k wrote his String Sextet. Simrock showed the score to the leading violinist Joseph Joachim, who with others premiered it in November of that year. Joachim became a \"chief champion\" of Dvo\u0159\u00e1k's chamber music. In that same year, Dvo\u0159\u00e1k also wrote his Violin Concerto. In December, he dedicated the piece to Joachim and sent him the score. The next spring the two discussed the score and Dvo\u0159\u00e1k revised it extensively, but Joachim was still not comfortable with it. The concerto was premiered in Prague in October 1883 by the violinist Franti\u0161ek Ond\u0159\u00ed\u010dek, who also played it in Vienna with conductor Hans Richter in December of that year. Twice later, Joachim was scheduled to play the concerto, but both times the arrangements fell through and he never did play it.\nHans Richter asked Dvo\u0159\u00e1k to compose his Symphony No. 6 for the Vienna Philharmonic, intending to premiere it in December 1880. However, Dvo\u0159\u00e1k later discovered that, despite this intention, members of the orchestra objected to performing works by the composer in two consecutive seasons, due to \"anti-Czech feeling\". Adolf \u010cech therefore conducted the premiere of the symphony at a concert of the \"Philharmonia\" society (in Czech: \"spolek Filharmonie\", predecessor of the Czech Philharmonic) on 25 March 1881, in Prague. Richter did eventually conduct the piece in London in 1882 and always retained an interest in Dvo\u0159\u00e1k's compositions.\nReception in Britain.\nDvo\u0159\u00e1k's first piece of a religious nature, his setting of Stabat Mater, was premiered in Prague in 1880. However, after it was performed and very well received at the Royal Albert Hall in London on 10 March 1883, conducted by Joseph Barnby, the success \"sparked off a whole series of performances in England and the United States\", a year ahead of appreciation in Germany and Austria. Dvo\u0159\u00e1k was invited to visit Britain, where he appeared to great acclaim in 1884. The London Philharmonic Society commissioned Dvo\u0159\u00e1k to conduct concerts in London, and his performances were well received there. In response to the commission, Dvo\u0159\u00e1k wrote his Symphony No. 7 and conducted its premiere at St James's Hall on 22 April 1885. On a visit later in 1885, Dvo\u0159\u00e1k presented his cantata \"The Spectre's Bride\" in a concert on 27 August. He had arrived a week early to conduct rehearsals of the chorus of 500 voices and orchestra of 150. The performance was \"a greater triumph than any\" Dvo\u0159\u00e1k \"had had in his life up to that time...following this phenomenal success, choral societies in the English-speaking countries hastened to prepare and present the new work.\" Dvo\u0159\u00e1k visited Britain at least eight times in total, conducting his own works there. In 1887, Richter conducted the \"Symphonic Variations\" in London and Vienna to great acclaim (they had been written ten years earlier and Dvo\u0159\u00e1k had allowed them to languish after initial lack of interest from his publishers). Richter wrote to Dvo\u0159\u00e1k of the London performance, \"at the hundreds of concerts I have conducted during my life, no new work has been as successful as yours\".\n1888\u20131891.\nDespite Dvo\u0159\u00e1k's newfound success, a February 1888 performance of Stabat Mater in Vienna fell victim to more anti-Czech feeling and what the composer called \"destructive criticism\". He heartily thanked Richter for his \"courage and devoted sympathy\". In 1890, influenced by Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky, Dvo\u0159\u00e1k also visited Russia, and conducted performances of his music in Moscow and St. Petersburg. In 1891, Dvo\u0159\u00e1k received an honorary degree from the University of Cambridge, and was offered a position at the Prague Conservatory as professor of composition and instrumentation. At first he refused the offer, but then later accepted; this change of mind was seemingly a result of a quarrel with his publisher Simrock over payment for his Eighth Symphony. Dvo\u0159\u00e1k's Requiem was premiered later that year in Birmingham at the Triennial Music Festival.\nIn 1891 the Bohemian String Quartet, later called the Czech Quartet, was founded, with Karel Hoffmann, first violin, Josef Suk, second violin, Oskar Nedbal, viola, and Otto Berger, cello. It is said that Nedbal and Suk had been two of Dvo\u0159\u00e1k's \"most promising\" students at the Conservatory and took the initiative in founding the Quartet. As of 1891 Dvo\u0159\u00e1k had written 11 string quartets, six of which had been premiered, and these were available as part of the repertory of the Quartet on tour, as were the two quartets of Smetana.\nUnited States.\nFrom 1892 to 1895, Dvo\u0159\u00e1k was the director of the National Conservatory of Music in New York City. The Conservatory's President, Jeannette Thurber, offered Dvo\u0159\u00e1k an annual salary of $15,000 \u2013 an incredibly lavish sum for the era (), twenty-five times what he was paid at the Prague Conservatory. Emanuel Rubin describes the Conservatory and Dvo\u0159\u00e1k's time there. Thurber, a wealthy and philanthropic woman, made it open to women and black students as well as white men, which was unusual for the times. Dvo\u0159\u00e1k's original contract provided for three hours a day of work, including teaching and conducting, six days a week, with four months of vacation each summer. The Panic of 1893, a severe economic depression, depleted the assets of the Thurber family and other patrons of the Conservatory. In 1894, Dvo\u0159\u00e1k's salary was cut to $8,000 per year and moreover was paid only irregularly. The Conservatory was located at 126\u2013128 East Seventeenth Street, but was demolished in 1911 and replaced by what is today a high school.\nDvo\u0159\u00e1k's main goal in America was to discover \"American Music\" and engage in it, much as he had used Czech folk idioms within his music. Shortly after his arrival in America in 1892, Dvo\u0159\u00e1k wrote a series of newspaper articles reflecting on the state of American music. He supported the concept that African-American and Native American music should be used as a foundation for the growth of American music. He felt that through the music of Native Americans and African-Americans, Americans would find their own national style of music. Here Dvo\u0159\u00e1k met Harry Burleigh, who later became one of the earliest African-American composers. Burleigh introduced Dvo\u0159\u00e1k to traditional African-American spirituals.\nIn the winter and spring of 1893, Dvo\u0159\u00e1k was commissioned by the New York Philharmonic to write Symphony No. 9, \"From the New World\", which was premiered under the baton of Anton Seidl, to tumultuous applause. Clapham writes that \"without question this was one of the greatest triumphs, and very possibly the greatest triumph of all that Dvo\u0159\u00e1k experienced\" in his life, and when the Symphony was published it was \"seized on by conductors and orchestras\" all over the world.\nTwo months before leaving for America, Dvo\u0159\u00e1k hired Josef Jan Kova\u0159\u00edk as his secretary, who had just finished violin studies at the Prague Conservatory and was about to return to his home in the United States. There he continued to serve as Dvo\u0159\u00e1k's secretary and lived with the Dvo\u0159\u00e1k family. He had come from the Czech-speaking community of Spillville, Iowa, where his father Jan Josef Kova\u0159\u00edk was a schoolmaster. Dvo\u0159\u00e1k decided to spend the summer of 1893 in Spillville, along with all his family; he referred to it as his \"summer Vysok\u00e1\". While there he composed the String Quartet in F (the \"American\") and the String Quintet in E\u266d major. Back in New York that autumn, he composed his Sonatina for violin and piano. He also conducted a performance of his Eighth Symphony at the Columbian Exposition in Chicago that same year.\nIn the winter of 1894\u201395, Dvo\u0159\u00e1k wrote his Cello Concerto in B minor, Op. 104, B. 191, completed in February 1895. However, due to homesickness, his partially unpaid salary, and increasing recognition in Europe \u2013 he had been made an honorary member of the Gesellschaft der Musikfreunde in Vienna \u2013 he decided to return to Bohemia. He informed Thurber that he was leaving. Dvo\u0159\u00e1k and his wife left New York before the end of the spring term, with no intention of returning.\nDvo\u0159\u00e1k's New York home was located at 327 East Seventeenth Street, near the intersection of what is today called Perlman Place.\nIt was in this house that both the B minor Cello Concerto and the New World Symphony were written within a few years. Despite protests, from Czech President V\u00e1clav Havel among others who wanted the house preserved as a historical site, it was demolished in 1991 to make room for a Beth Israel Medical Center residence for people with AIDS. In 2017, this residence was converted into a homeless shelter. To honor Dvo\u0159\u00e1k, a statue of him was erected in nearby Stuyvesant Square.\nBrahms continued to try to \"clear a path for\" Dvo\u0159\u00e1k, \"the only contemporary whom he considered really worthy\". While Dvo\u0159\u00e1k was in America, Simrock was still publishing his music in Germany, and Brahms corrected proofs for him. Dvo\u0159\u00e1k said it was hard to understand why Brahms would \"take on the very tedious job of proofreading. I don't believe there is another musician of his stature in the whole world who would do such a thing.\"\nReturn to Europe and last years.\nDvo\u0159\u00e1k returned from the United States on 27 April 1895 with his wife and Otakar Berger. After a performance of \"Dimitrij\" at the National Theater on 19 May, Dvo\u0159\u00e1k left the city for the family country cottage in Vysok\u00e1. Dvo\u0159\u00e1k's first love and later sister-in-law, Josefina Kaunitzov\u00e1, n\u00e9e \u010cerm\u00e1kov\u00e1, died in May 1895. He and she had maintained friendly relations over the years. After her death, he revised the coda of his Cello Concerto in her memory.\nDuring Dvo\u0159\u00e1k's final years, he concentrated on composing opera, chamber music and tone poems. In November 1895, he resumed his professorship at the Prague Conservatory. Between 1895 and 1897, he completed his string quartets in A\u266d major and G major, and also worked on the cycle of four symphonic poems inspired by the collection \"Kytice\" by Karel Jarom\u00edr Erben. As seen in Burghauser's 1960 Catalogue, Dvo\u0159\u00e1k wrote his five Symphonic Poems in 1896, but after that completed few works per year, mainly operas: \"Jakob\u00edn\" in 1896, nothing in 1897, only \"The Devil and Kate\" in 1898\u20131899, \"Rusalka\" in 1900, two songs and \"Recitatives\" in 1900\u20131901, and finally the opera \"Armida\" in 1902\u20131903. \"Rusalka\" became the most popular of all Dvo\u0159\u00e1k's ten operas and gained an international reputation (below under Works, Operas).\nIn 1896 he visited London for the last time to conduct the premiere of his Cello Concerto in B minor by the London Philharmonic. Also in 1896, Brahms tried to persuade Dvo\u0159\u00e1k, who had several children, to move to Vienna. Brahms said he had no dependents and \"If you need anything, my fortune is at your disposal\". Clapham writes \"Dvo\u0159\u00e1k was deeply moved and tears came to his wife's eyes, but it was quite impossible for him, a Czech, to contemplate leaving Bohemia.\" Brahms himself had little time left to live, as he died 3 April 1897. Also, Brahms hoped to gain an ally in Vienna to \"counterbalance the influence of\" Bruckner.\nIn 1897, Dvo\u0159\u00e1k visited Brahms on his deathbed and attended his funeral on 6 April 1897. In November Dvo\u0159\u00e1k was appointed a member of the jury for the Viennese Artists' Stipendium. In 1898 Dvo\u0159\u00e1k's daughter Otilie married his student, the composer Josef Suk. At about the same time (November 1898), he was informed that Emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria-Hungary would award him a gold medal for \"Litteris et Artibus\", the ceremony taking place before an audience in June 1899. On 4 April 1900 Dvo\u0159\u00e1k conducted his last concert with the Czech Philharmonic, performing Brahms' Tragic Overture, Schubert's \"Unfinished\" Symphony, Beethoven's 8th Symphony, and Dvo\u0159\u00e1k's own symphonic poem \"The Wild Dove\". In April 1901, The Emperor appointed him a member of the Austrian House of Lords, along with the leading Czech poet Jaroslav Vrchlick\u00fd. Dvo\u0159\u00e1k also succeeded Anton\u00edn Bennewitz as director of the Prague Conservatory from November 1901 until his death. Dvo\u0159\u00e1k's 60th birthday was celebrated as a national event. First, around the actual date, six of his operas and the oratorio Saint Ludmila were performed in Prague, but Dvo\u0159\u00e1k was away in Vienna; then in November 1901 came the \"postponed official birthday party... In many towns all over Bohemia and Moravia, the Czech people celebrated his birthday.\"\nOn 25 March 1904 Dvo\u0159\u00e1k had to leave a rehearsal of \"Armida\" because of illness. The first Czech Musical Festival, in April 1904, had \"a programme consisting almost entirely\" of Dvo\u0159\u00e1k's music (Leo\u0161 Jan\u00e1\u010dek was disappointed that none of his music was performed.) \"Seventy-six choral associations\" from all over Bohemia gathered in Prague, and \"sixteen thousand singers\" sang Dvo\u0159\u00e1k's oratorio \"Saint Ludmila\". \"Thousands of listeners celebrated\" the symphony \"From the New World\". Dvo\u0159\u00e1k himself was forced by illness to \"take to his bed\" and so was unable to attend.\nDvo\u0159\u00e1k had an \"attack of influenza\" on 18 April and died on 1 May 1904, of an undiagnosed cause following five weeks of illness, at the age of 62, leaving many unfinished works. His funeral service was held on 5 May, and his remains were buried in Vy\u0161ehrad Cemetery in Prague, beneath a bust by Czech sculptor Ladislav \u0160aloun.\nStyle.\nMany of Dvo\u0159\u00e1k's compositions, such as the \"Slavonic Dances\" and his large collection of songs, were directly inspired by Czech, Moravian, and other Slavic traditional music. As the basis for his works, Dvo\u0159\u00e1k frequently used Slavic folk dance forms including the sko\u010dn\u00e1; the Bohemian furiant, sousedsk\u00e1, and \u0161pacirka; the Slovak odzemek; the Polish mazurka and polonaise; the Yugoslav Kolo; and folk song forms of Slavic peoples, including the Ukrainian dumka. His 16 Slavonic Dances, Op. 46, which first brought him a wide reputation, and Op. 72, include at least one of each of these forms. He also wrote an orchestral \"Polonaise\" (1879). He named the third movement of his 6th Symphony as \"Scherzo (Furiant)\". His Dumky Trio is one of his best-known chamber works, and is named for the dumka, a traditional Ukrainian and Slavic genre. His major works reflect his heritage and love for his native land. Dvo\u0159\u00e1k followed in the footsteps of Bed\u0159ich Smetana, the creator of the modern Czech musical style.\nDvo\u0159\u00e1k had been an admirer of Wagner's music since 1857. Late in life, he said that Wagner \"was so great a genius that he was capable of doing things that were beyond the reach of other composers\". Wagner especially influenced Dvo\u0159\u00e1k's operas, but also some orchestral pieces. According to Clapham, the theme of the Andante Sostenuto from his fourth symphony \"could almost have come directly out of \"Tannh\u00e4user\"\".\nFrom 1873 on, Dvo\u0159\u00e1k's style was \"moving steadily in the direction of classical models\". To be more specific about \"classical models\", in 1894 Dvo\u0159\u00e1k wrote an article in which he said the composers of the past he admired most were Bach, Mozart, Beethoven and Schubert. As the article was specifically on Schubert, three years in advance of the centennial of his birth, it seems Dvo\u0159\u00e1k had a special predilection toward Schubert.\nWorks.\nDvo\u0159\u00e1k wrote in a variety of forms: his nine symphonies generally conform to classical models, but he also composed the new symphonic poems. Many of his works show the influence of Czech folk music rhythms and melodic shapes. Amongst them are the two sets of Slavonic Dances, the \"Symphonic Variations\", and the majority of his songs. The echoes of such influence are also found in his major choral works. Dvo\u0159\u00e1k wrote ten operas (of which the best known is \"Rusalka\"), serenades for string orchestra and wind ensemble, chamber music (including a number of string quartets and quintets), and piano music.\nNumbering.\nA large number of Dvo\u0159\u00e1k's works were given opus numbers, but not always in the order in which they were written or published. To improve sales, some publishers such as N. Simrock preferred to represent budding composers as being well established by giving early works much higher opus numbers than their chronological order would merit. In other cases, Dvo\u0159\u00e1k deliberately assigned lower opus numbers to new works to be able to sell them outside contract obligations to his publishers. An example is the \"Czech Suite\", which Dvo\u0159\u00e1k did not want to sell to Simrock, and had published with Schlesinger as Op. 39 instead of Op. 52. This led to the same opus number being given to more than one of Dvo\u0159\u00e1k's works; for example, the opus number 12 was assigned successively to the opera \"King and Charcoal Burner\" (1871), the Concert Overture in F (1871, derived from the opera), the String Quartet No. 6 in A minor (1873), the Furiant in G minor for piano (1879), and the Dumka in C minor for piano (1884). In other cases, a work was given as many as three different opus numbers by different publishers.\nTo add to this confusion, the numbering of Dvo\u0159\u00e1k's symphonies has varied:\nAll of Dvo\u0159\u00e1k's works were catalogued chronologically by Jarmil Burghauser. As an example, in the Burghauser catalogue, the \"New World Symphony\", Op. 95, is B.178. Scholars today often refer to Dvo\u0159\u00e1k's works by their B numbers (for Burghauser), partly because many early works do not have opus numbers. References to the traditional opus numbers are still common because of their historical continuity with earlier scores and printed programs. The opus numbers remain more likely to appear in printed performance programs.\nSymphonies.\nDuring Dvo\u0159\u00e1k's life, only five of his symphonies were widely known. The first one published was the sixth, dedicated to Hans Richter. After Dvo\u0159\u00e1k's death, research uncovered four unpublished symphonies. The manuscript of the first one had even been lost to the composer himself. This led to the situation in which the \"New World Symphony\" has successively been called the 5th, 8th and 9th. The modern chronological numbering system is used here.\nWith their lyrical style and accessibility to the listener, Dvo\u0159\u00e1k's symphonies seem to derive from the Schubertian tradition; but, as Taruskin suggests, the difference was Dvo\u0159\u00e1k's use of cyclic form, especially in his later symphonies and concertos, where he \"occasionally recycled themes... to a degree which lent his works a tinge of secret 'programmaticism'\".\nSymphony No. 1 in C minor, Op. 3, was written in 1865 when Dvo\u0159\u00e1k was 24 years old. It was later subtitled \"The Bells of Zlonice\", in reference to the time Dvo\u0159\u00e1k spent in the village of Zlonice, and in the church there, between the age of 13 and 16. Like the Symphony No. 2 in B\u266d major, Op. 4, also in 1865, despite touches of originality, it did not remain in the standard symphonic repertory.\nSymphony No. 3 in E\u266d major, Op. 10 (c. 1873), shows the impact of Dvo\u0159\u00e1k's acquaintance with the music of Richard Wagner. This influence is less evident in Symphony No. 4 in D minor, Op. 13, except for the start of the second movement.\nSymphony No. 5 in F major, Op. 76, and Symphony No. 6 in D major, Op. 60, are largely pastoral in nature. The Sixth, published in 1880, shows a resemblance to the Symphony No. 2 of Brahms, particularly in the outer movements, but not so much in the third-movement furiant, a vivid Czech dance. This was the symphony that made Dvo\u0159\u00e1k internationally known as a symphonic composer.\nSymphony No. 7 in D minor of 1885, Op. 70, is highly regarded by critics and musicologists; Sir Donald Tovey stated that \"along with the four Brahms symphonies and Schubert's Ninth, it is among the greatest and purest examples in this art-form since Beethoven\".\nSymphony No. 8 in G major, Op. 88, is characterized by a warmer and more optimistic tone. Karl Schumann (in booklet notes for a recording of all the symphonies by Rafael Kubel\u00edk) compares it to the works of Gustav Mahler.\nSymphony No. 9 in E minor, Op. 95, is also known by its subtitle \"From the New World\", or as the \"New World Symphony\". Dvo\u0159\u00e1k wrote it between January and May 1893, while he was in New York. At the time of its first performance, he claimed that he used elements from American music such as spirituals and Native American music in this work, but he later denied this. Neil Armstrong took a recording of the \"New World Symphony\" to the Moon during the Apollo 11 mission in 1969, and in 2009 it was voted the favourite symphony in a poll run by ABC Classic FM in Australia.\nMany conductors have recorded cycles of the symphonies, including Istv\u00e1n Kert\u00e9sz, Rafael Kubel\u00edk, Witold Rowicki, Neeme J\u00e4rvi, Zden\u011bk M\u00e1cal, V\u00e1clav Neumann, Libor Pe\u0161ek, Otmar Suitner, Ji\u0159\u00ed B\u011blohl\u00e1vek, and Jos\u00e9 Serebrier.\nAdolf \u010cech premiered more of Dvo\u0159\u00e1k's symphonies than anyone else. He conducted the first performances of Nos. 2, 5 and 6; the composer premiered Nos. 7 and 8; Bed\u0159ich Smetana led Nos. 3 and 4; Anton Seidl conducted No. 9; and Milan Sachs premiered No. 1.\nSymphonic poems.\nDvo\u0159\u00e1k wrote five symphonic poems, all in 1896\u20131897 with sequential opus numbers: \"The Water Goblin\", Op. 107; \"The Noon Witch\", Op. 108; \"The Golden Spinning Wheel\", Op. 109; \"The Wild Dove\", Op. 110; and \"A Hero's Song\", Op. 111. The first four of poems are based upon ballads from the collection \"Kytice\" by the Czech folklorist Karel Jarom\u00edr Erben. \"A Hero's Song\" is based on a program of Dvo\u0159\u00e1k's devising and is believed to be autobiographical.\nChoral works.\nTo Dvo\u0159\u00e1k's main choral works belong his setting of Stabat Mater (the longest extant setting of that text), his Requiem, his setting of the Te Deum and his Mass in D major.\nThe Stabat Mater, Op. 58, is an extensive (c. 90 minutes) vocal-instrumental sacred work for soli (soprano, alto, tenor and bass), choir and orchestra based on the text of an old church hymn with the same name. The inspiration for creating this piece was the death of the composer's daughter, Josefa.\nAnton\u00edn Dvo\u0159\u00e1k composed his Requiem in 1890, at the beginning of the peak period of his career. Dvo\u0159\u00e1k was deeply religious, and this work reflects his faith and spirituality. The premiere took place on 9 October 1891 in Birmingham, conducted by Dvo\u0159\u00e1k himself, and was \"very successful\". It had an outstanding success in Boston 30 November 1892: \"the composer was frequently applauded between numbers and given a most enthusiastic ovation at the end.\". In Vienna it was greeted, belatedly, in 1901: \"The Vienna performance in March 1901 was a triumph of Dvo\u0159\u00e1k's music, as if the Viennese public wished thereby to make up for their earlier, sometimes cool reception of his works.\"\nThe Te Deum, Op. 103, is a cantata for soprano and baritone solo, choir and orchestra to the Latin text of the famous hymn Te Deum (God, we laud You). It was composed in 1892 and dedicated to the 400th anniversary of the discovery of America. The composition had been completed before Dvo\u0159\u00e1k moved to America and was commissioned by Jeanette Thurber in 1891, when the composer accepted a position as director of her school. Te Deum is more intimate than the Stabat Mater and Requiem. It was premiered at Dvo\u0159\u00e1k's first concert in New York on 21 October 1892.\nThe Mass in D major (first numbered Op. 76, then Op. 86) was originally intended for organ, solo voices and small choir. The work was finalized in 1892 when, in response to a request from the Novello publishers of London, Dvo\u0159\u00e1k arranged his Mass for symphony orchestra.\nThe oratorio \"Saint Ludmila\" was a huge success in Bohemia and Moravia, sung at events in Dvo\u0159\u00e1k's honor in 1901 and 1904. The piece had considerable success in England in October 1886, with an audience on the 15th \"in raptures... the critics praised the music in the warmest terms\", and on the 29th, there was a \"large and equally enthusiastic audience, and once again the critics were full of praise\", but the libretto's translation from Czech into English was \"regarded on all sides as unsatisfactory\".\nThe cantata \"The Spectre's Bride\", Op. 69, B. 135, performed in 1885 at the Birmingham, England, Musical Festival, was the greatest success to that point in Dvo\u0159\u00e1k's career.\nConcerti.\nThe critic Harold C. Schonberg described \"an attractive Piano Concerto in G minor with a rather ineffective piano part, a beautiful Violin Concerto in A minor, and a supreme Cello Concerto in B minor\". All the concerti are in the classical three-movement form.\nThe Concerto for Piano and Orchestra in G minor, Op. 33 was the first of three concerti (for solo instrument and orchestra) that Dvo\u0159\u00e1k composed, but is the least known of the three.\nThe Concerto for Violin and Orchestra in A minor, Op. 53 was written in 1878 for Joseph Joachim, a prominent violinist whom Dvo\u0159\u00e1k had met and admired. It was finished in 1879, but Joachim was skeptical about the work. The concerto was premiered in 1883 in Prague by the violinist Franti\u0161ek Ond\u0159\u00ed\u010dek, who also gave its first performances in Vienna and London.\nIn 1865, early in his career, Dvo\u0159\u00e1k had composed a Cello concerto in A major with Piano accompaniment, B. 10. G\u00fcnter Raphael in 1925\u20131929 produced a revised and orchestrated version. Dvo\u0159\u00e1k's cataloguer Jarmil Burghauser made another orchestration and abridgement, published in 1975. The Concerto for Cello and Orchestra in B minor, Op. 104 was the final concerto to be composed. He wrote it in 1894\u20131895 for his friend Hanu\u0161 Wihan. Wihan and others had asked for a cello concerto for some time, but Dvo\u0159\u00e1k refused, stating that the cello was a fine orchestral instrument but completely insufficient for a solo concerto. Dvo\u0159\u00e1k composed the concerto in New York while serving as the Director of the National Conservatory. In 1894, Victor Herbert, who was also teaching at the Conservatory, had written his Second Cello Concerto, Op. 30 and presented it several times that year, including its successful premiere with the New York Philharmonic under Anton Seidl. Dvo\u0159\u00e1k attended at least two performances of Herbert's cello concerto and was inspired to fulfill Wihan's request for a cello concerto. Dvo\u0159\u00e1k's concerto premiered in London on 16 March 1896, with the English cellist Leo Stern. The reception was \"enthusiastic\". Brahms said of the work: \"Had I known that one could write a cello concerto like this, I would have written one long ago!\" Agreeing with Schonberg, the cellist and author Robert Battey wrote \"I believe it to be the greatest of all cello concertos...an opinion shared by most cellists\". A compiler of discographies of Dvo\u0159\u00e1k's music wrote that his is the \"king\" of cello concertos.\nChamber music.\nA viola player himself, Dvo\u0159\u00e1k had a natural affinity for string instruments. Over a period of thirty years, Dvo\u0159\u00e1k composed over forty chamber music works.\nString quintets.\nIn 1860, just after he completed his education at the Prague Organ School, Dvo\u0159\u00e1k composed his String Quintet No. 1 in A minor, Op. 1. Two more would follow, of which the String Quintet No. 2 in G major, Op. 77 from early 1875, is noteworthy for the use of a double bass. This quintet was written towards the end of the composer's transitional phase, incorporating a thematic density to his works. This quintet is characterized by delicate operetta style uncommon in his instrumental work. The extension of a variation to all section is reminiscent of his symphonic literature. It was written for a chamber music competition sponsored by the \"Um\u011bleck\u00e1 beseda\" (Artistic Circle), where it was unanimously awarded a prize of five ducats for the \"distinction of theme, the technical skill in polyphonic composition, the mastery of form and the knowledge of the instruments\" displayed. The String Quintet No. 3 in E\u266d major, Op. 97, with a second viola added, was written near the end of his American period in 1893, when he spent a summer holiday in Spillville, Iowa.\nString quartets.\nIn the 1880s Dvo\u0159\u00e1k made a list of his destroyed compositions, including string quartets in B-flat, D, and E minor of 1868\u201370. Dvo\u0159\u00e1k destroyed these compositions during his \"mad period\" only after copies had already been printed. The number of errors in the parts makes it unlikely that they were ever played. Dvo\u0159\u00e1k kept the manuscripts of these quartets but did not give them opus numbers. They are noted to have numbers B.17, B.18, and B.19 in the Burghauser catalog and show the strong influence of the music of Richard Wagner. The second, third, and fourth quartets illustrate Dvo\u0159\u00e1k's progress as a composer. He demonstrates understanding of highly developed musical language in his D major quartet, shaping the melody of the Slav freedom song \"Hej Slovane\" ('Hey, Slavs!') in a variation style. The quartet in E minor is a single movement, including a slow, 63 bars on an F# pedal point. The single movement from the E minor quartet was used five years later in his second string quintet Op. 77, as a second movement named \"Intermezzo: Nocturne\", making this initially a five-movement composition. He later withdrew the second movement and reworked it into the Nocturne for Strings in B major, Op. 40 (B. 47). These show a stronger sense of form and include three separate arrangements: for orchestra (B47), for violin and piano (B48A), and for piano four hands (B48B).\nDuring his time in America in 1893, Dvo\u0159\u00e1k composed two of his most popular quartets: the String Quartet No. 12 in F, Op. 96 (\"The American\") and the String Quintet in E-flat, Op. 97 (B180). Dvo\u0159\u00e1k composed this work in three days after he and his family reunited in Spillville, Iowa. He drew inspiration from the freedom he felt in the countryside of America. This piece is distinguishable from his other quartets due to the simplicity of it writing. Throughout the piece, Dvo\u0159\u00e1k uses skipping rhythms, high register of the first violin, and unified key relationships among all movements except for the Lento movement. There is less shaping in thematic material, heavy uses of repetition, and less attention was paid to the development. Shortly after the composition of Op. 96, Dvo\u0159\u00e1k composed his E-flat major String Quintet, Op. 97. This piece was distinguished from his prior chamber works due to the instrumentation of two viola parts. The influence that Native American folk music had on Dvo\u0159\u00e1k's work also was apparent in Op. 97. There is a common drum rhythm in Native American music that is presented throughout all of the movements except the Larghetto.\nOther chamber works.\nHe also composed two piano quintets, both in A major, of which the second, Op. 81, is the better known. He left a Terzetto for two violins and viola (Op. 74); two piano quartets (Op. 23 and Op. 87), a string sextet, Op. 48; and four piano trios, including the Piano Trio No. 4 (subtitled \"Dumky\"), Op. 90. He also wrote a set of \"Bagatelles\", Op. 47, for the unusual combination of two violins, cello, and harmonium. The \"Bagatelles\" are cyclical and similar to a suite, echoing Czech bagpipe melodies. Dvo\u0159\u00e1k wrote two waltzes for string quartet, and arranged set of 12 love songs for the string quartet entitled \"Echo of Songs\" (B152), taken from his set of 18 songs originally composed in 1865 entitled \"Cypresses\". His works for violin and piano include the \"Romantic Pieces\", the Violin Sonatina, and the Violin Sonata.\nOperas.\nIn a 1904 interview, Dvo\u0159\u00e1k claimed that opera was 'the most suitable form for the nation'. If this nationalist sentiment was at the heart of his opera compositions, he struggled to find a style straddling Czech traditional melody and the grand opera style of Giacomo Meyerbeer, which he experienced as lead viola player in the orchestra of Prague's Provisional Theatre between 1862 and 1871, and whose influence is evident in his works such as \"Vanda\" and \"Dimitrij\". His later interest in the music of Richard Wagner also influenced his operas, evident in his extensive rewrite of \"Dmitrij\" in 1894, following its failure at Vienna.\nOf all his operas, only \"Rusalka\", Op. 114, which contains the well-known aria \"M\u011bs\u00ed\u010dku na nebi hlubok\u00e9m\" (\"Song to the Moon\"), is played on contemporary opera stages with any frequency outside the Czech Republic. This is attributable to their uneven invention and libretti, and perhaps also their staging requirements \u2013 \"The Jacobin\", \"Armida\", \"Vanda\" and \"Dimitrij\" need stages large enough to portray invading armies.\nThere is speculation by Dvo\u0159\u00e1k scholars such as Michael Beckerman that the second movement of his Symphony No. 9 \"From the New World\", was adapted from studies for a never-written opera about Hiawatha.\nSongs.\nThe song cycle of 10 \"Biblical Songs\", Op. 99, B. 185, was written in March 1894. Around that time Dvo\u0159\u00e1k was informed of the death of the famous conductor, and his close personal friend, Hans von B\u00fclow. A month earlier, he had been grieved to hear that his father was near death, far away in Bohemia. Dvo\u0159\u00e1k consoled himself in the Psalms. The resulting work, considered the finest of his song cycles, is based on the text of the Czech Bible of Kralice. Dvo\u0159\u00e1k's father died 28 March 1894, two days after the completion of the work.\nAnother well known cycle is the seven \"Gypsy Songs\" (Czech \"Cik\u00e1nsk\u00e9 melodie\") B. 104, Op. 55 which includes \"Songs My Mother Taught Me\" (the fourth of the set).\nDvo\u0159\u00e1k created many other songs inspired by Czech national traditional music, such as the \"Love Songs\", \"Evening Songs\", etc.\nOther works.\nFrom other works that show the influence of Czech folk rhythms and melodic shapes, perhaps the best known examples are the two sets of Slavonic Dances. The first book, Op. 46 (1878), is predominantly Czech in form. It was created for piano duet (one piano, four hands), but Dvo\u0159\u00e1k then orchestrated the entire set, completing it the same year. The second book, Op. 72 (also composed originally for piano four hands), composed eight years later, includes forms native to other Slavic lands Serbia, Poland and Ukraine, although some \"merge characteristics of more than one dance\". Dvo\u0159\u00e1k did not use actual folk tunes, but created his own themes in the style of traditional folk music, using the rhythms of original folk dances.\nA work that does not fit in the other categories is the \"Symphonic Variations\" of 1877. Orchestral variations on an original theme, composed as a freestanding work, were a rather unusual genre. Originally unsuccessful and revived only after ten years, it has since established itself in the repertoire.\nLegacy.\nThe Anton\u00edn Dvo\u0159\u00e1k Museum in Prague contains many manuscripts and correspondence of the composer, along with a significant part of Dvo\u0159\u00e1k\u2019s score archive and library. \nThe 1980 film \"Concert at the End of Summer\" is based on Dvo\u0159\u00e1k's life. Dvo\u0159\u00e1k was played by Josef Vinkl\u00e1\u0159. The 2012 television film \"The American Letters\" focuses on Dvo\u0159\u00e1k's love life. Dvo\u0159\u00e1k is played by Hynek \u010cerm\u00e1k. Ian Krykorka has written a number of children's books based on some of Dvo\u0159\u00e1k's operas. Josef \u0160kvoreck\u00fd wrote \"Dvorak in Love\" about his life in America as Director of the National Conservatory for Music.\nAsteroid 2055 Dvo\u0159\u00e1k, discovered by Lubo\u0161 Kohoutek, is named in his honor. Dvorak (Anton) Park in Chicago's Pilsen Historic District is also named after the composer.\nNotes and references.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nDetails\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;"}

{"id": "76589", "revid": "1175300", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=76589", "title": "Al Taliaferro", "text": "American comics artist\nCharles Alfred \"Al\" Taliaferro ( ; August 29, 1905 \u2013 February 3, 1969), was an American Disney comics artist who produced Disney comic strips for King Features Syndicate. Taliaferro is best known for his work on the \"Donald Duck\" comic strip. Many of his strips were written by Bob Karp.\nFamily background.\nThe Taliaferros trace their origins to Northern Italy and were one of the early families who settled in the Colony of Virginia during the 17th century. The family name, originally , literally means 'Ironcutter' in the Italian language.\nEarly career.\nAfter his family moved to Glendale, California, Taliaferro studied at the Art Institute of Los Angeles, California. Following his graduation, Taliaferro was hired as a designer for light fixtures. In January 1931, Taliaferro was hired by Walt Disney Studios as an animator, but soon transferred to the comic strip department.\nAt the time, Disney comics were limited to the \"Mickey Mouse\" comic strip, with Floyd Gottfredson as its main artist. Taliaferro was hired as an inker for Gottfredson's drawings. Taliaferro also served as the inker for a model sheet for the Mickey Mouse character. The model sheet would later be featured in Disney merchandising.\nDisney soon launched a \"Silly Symphony\" comic strip (1932\u20131939), based on the \"Silly Symphony\" short film series. The strip debuted on January 10, 1932, as a Sunday comic strip. It would appear on a weekly schedule, in full color. The original writer and penciller for the comic strip was Earl Duvall, with Taliaferro serving as his inker. In 1933, Duvall quit the strip and the Disney studio, as he was hired by Leon Schlesinger Productions. Taliaferro replaced him as the comic strip's penciller. The new main writer of the comic strip was Ted Osborne, but the comic strip also featured a number of stories written by Merrill De Maris.\nThe comic strip had started by introducing a new character, not based on any previous Disney animated short. The character was Bucky Bug, an anthropomorphic insect whose creation is credited to Duvall and Taliaferro. Bucky Bug would continue to be the star of the comic strip until March 4, 1934. He was the second Disney character (after Mickey Mouse) to become the star of his own comic strip series. The Bucky Bug stories were typical for a talking animal series, though every character was \neither an insect or another type of invertebrate.\nThe initial storyline of Taliaferro's comic strip was a coming-of-age story. Bucky Bug is introduced as a boy, the only son of his family. He has 16 sisters. He departs the family home to see the world, eventually settles down in the city of insects called \"Junktown\", and marries a local girl, called June Bug. June is the daughter of the town's mayor. The city which Bucky inhabits was built on human garbage, every building or structure was once an item discarded by humans. Besides Bucky and June, the most prominent character of these stories was Bo Bug, Bucky's best friend and sidekick. Bo was depicted as a hobo and always wore a top hat.\nWhile Taliaferro did not draw more Bucky Bug stories after 1934, the Bucky Bug series would eventually be revived in comic book form by Western Publishing. Bucky and his supporting cast have since appeared in Disney magazines and newspapers in many countries.\nIn the 1930s, the \"Silly Symphony\" film series was at the height of its popularity, due to its innovations in storytelling and professionalism in production methods. Other animation studios launched imitations with similar names, such as \"Looney Tunes\", \"Merrie Melodies\", and \"Happy Harmonies\". Taliaferro and Ted Osborne started producing comic strip adaptations of specific short films, as a tie-in to whichever \"Silly Symphony\" the Disney studio was trying to promote. In 1936, the comic strip started featuring the main cast of the hit short \"Three Little Pigs\" (1933). Taliaferro was the first artist to adapt Big Bad Wolf and the Three Little Pigs into comics, as characters of serial fiction. While in animation the characters soon faded away, in comics they had staying power. The Big Bad Wolf series would be continued by other artists, long after Taliaferro stopped producing new stories for it.\n\"Donald Duck\".\nIn 1934, Taliaferro and Osborne adapted the short film \"The Wise Little Hen\" (1934) into comic strip form. Their adaptation was published in newspapers between 16 September and 16 December 1934. The most prominent character introduced in the film was Donald Duck, and Taliaferro was the first artist to depict him in comics. Taliaferro's depiction of Donald preceded Donald's appearances as a supporting character in the \"Mickey Mouse\" newspaper comic (under Floyd Gottfredson and Ted Osborne), the adaptation into a British comic strip by William A. Ward (in 1937), and the adaptation of Donald into a full-length Italian comic book by Federico Pedrocchi (in 1937).\nBetween August 30, 1936, and December 5, 1937, Taliaferro and Osborne depicted Donald in gag-a-week comic strips for the \"Silly Symphony\" series. The strips were in pantomime style. Taliaferro came up with the idea of a solo comic strip for Donald Duck, but had trouble convincing his bosses to support his idea. He initially pitched the idea to Roy O. Disney, who rejected it. Taliaferro then produced three weeks-worth of episodes for a Donald Duck comic strip, brought them to Roy Disney, and asked him to offer the strip to King Features Syndicate for publication. King Features had syndicated all Disney comic strips up to this point. Roy Disney was not particularly interested in the project, but his brother Walt Disney could see potential in the project. Taliaferro's original sample stories were rejected due to having \"weak gags\". Taliaferro co-operated with writer Merrill De Maris to create new sample stories, but these were also rejected. Taliaferro then co-operated with writer Homer Brightman, and this time the sample stories were approved. Taliaferro's idea was greenlighted and the new Donald Duck comic strip was about to begin.\nOn February 2, 1938, \"Donald Duck\" started appearing in daily newspapers. A Sunday version was added on December 10, 1939. Taliaferro's was the strip's main penciller, while Homer Brightman was its writer and came up with the gags. But Brightman was mostly a screenwriter, and soon quit the comic strip and returned to writing plots for animated short films. Brightman was replaced by Bob Karp, who would serve as Taliaferro's main creative partner for the rest of his career. The inkers for the comic strip included Karl Karp\u00e9, Dick Moores, George Waiss, and Bill Wright. Taliaferro also relied on a number of assistant artists, including Ellis Eringer, Frank Grundeen, Al Hubbard, and Kay Wright.\nWhile the \"Mickey Mouse\" comic strip was an adventure series, the \"Donald Duck\" comic strip continued to be a daily comedy series. Each episode featured Donald dealing with problems and humorous situations. Most of the strips featured stand-alone gags, although some ongoing plots were introduced. The strips often lacked dialogue.\nSupporting cast.\nTaliaferro and Karp started introducing supporting characters from the \"Donald Duck\" cartoons, where the duo became the first to portray a number of Donald Duck universe characters in the comics. These comic strip debuts often even preceded the new characters' first film appearances, as the production schedule for animated films was extended over a much longer period than for comic strips. On March 17, 1938, they introduced Bolivar, Donald's pet St. Bernard. The strip found humor in the fact that Bolivar rarely listens to his owner. Taliaferro's design was based on the St. Bernard in the 1936 Mickey Mouse film, \"Alpine Climbers\". On October 17, 1937, Taliaferro and Osborne introduced Huey, Dewey, and Louie, based on a film that was in production at the time, \"Donald's Nephews\". Taliaferro actually proposed the initial idea for the film, so that the studio would have duck counterparts to Morty and Ferdie Fieldmouse, the nephews of Mickey Mouse.\nGus Goose, the \"lazy and gluttonous\" cousin of Donald, was introduced on May 9, 1938, almost a year before Gus' film debut in \"Donald's Cousin Gus\", that was still in early stages of production. On November 4, 1940, Taliaferro and Karp introduced a comic strip version of Daisy Duck, as Donald's new neighbor and love interest, shortly after her film debut in \"Mr. Duck Steps Out\" (1940). This was Daisy's first appearance in comics, not counting her prototype, Donna Duck, who appeared earlier in the British comics and was later introduced by Taliaferro and Karp as Daisy's rival. Grandma Duck, Donald's grandmother, was introduced on September 27, 1943, and was created for the comic strip by Taliaferro and Karp. Taliaferro based the design of the character on his mother-in-law and her old-fashioned ways. Taliaferro's version of Grandma is a hard-working farmer, but out of touch with the technological progress of the world surrounding her. Although not created by him, Scrooge McDuck joined the cast of the comic strip on February 13, 1951, and Ludwig Von Drake on September 25, 1961. Donald's car, the '313', or '1934 Belchfire Roustabout', was designed by Taliaferro on July 1, 1938, from a car that Donald drove in his first titular film, \"Don Donald\" (1937). The car has been associated with the character in comics ever since.\nRetirement.\nTaliaferro retired from the daily comic strip on October 10, 1967. He kept working on the Sunday version of the strip until his death in February, 1969. Since 1967, Taliaferro's duties on the comic strip had mostly been handled by Frank Grundeen, who replaced Taliaferro as the main artist upon his retirement and death. Bob Karp remained the strip's main writer until his retirement in 1974. The \"Donald Duck\" comic strip continued with new writers and artists over the following decades: Greg Crosby (writer, 1974\u20131979), Frank Smith (artist, 1976\u20131986), Bob Foster (writer, 1980\u20131989), Jim Franzen (artist, 1986), Daan Jippes (artist, 1986\u20131987), Ulrich Schr\u00f6der (artist, 1986), Jorgen Klubien (artist, 1986), Tony Strobl (artist, 1986\u20131987), Bill Langley (artist, 1987), Pete Alvarado (artist, 1987\u20131989), Larry Mayer (artist, 1987\u20131989), and finally Larry Knighton (artist, 1990\u20131995). In 1995, King Features decided to end the production of new episodes of the comic strip, and to start publishing reprints of older episodes.\nReprints.\nWhile many of Taliaferro's strips were reprinted in Disney comic books, in only a few instances did he do original artwork for comic books. Among these was the Cheerios Premium Giveaway \"Donald Duck: Counter Spy\" (1947) and the cover of \"Walt Disney's Comics and Stories\" #107 (August 1949) plus two Bucky Bug stories in WDC&amp;S #39 (Dec. 1943) and #60 (Sept. 1945) and a one-page Donald and Goofy gag based on \"No Sail\" in the latter. Two children's books with Disney characters he illustrated are \"Donald and His Cat Troubles\" (1948) and \"Donald Duck and the Hidden Gold\" (1951).\nIn 2015, IDW Publishing began three series of hardcover reprints of Taliaferro's Disney comics under their imprint The Library of American Comics:\nLegacy.\nAnimation historian Jim Korkis noted that Taliaferro designed the mascot Litternaut in 1967 who adorned the public trash receptacles in Glendale into the 1970s and to this day is the official mascot of the \"Committee for a Clean &amp; Beautiful Glendale\".\nTaliaferro was posthumously honored with a Disney Legends award in 2003."}

Mermaids appear in the folklore of many cultures worldwide, including Europe, Latin America, Asia, and Africa.\nMermaids are sometimes associated with perilous events such as storms, shipwrecks, and drownings (cf. ). In other folk traditions (or sometimes within the same traditions), they can be benevolent or beneficent, bestowing boons or falling in love with humans.\nThe male equivalent of the mermaid is the merman, also a familiar figure in folklore and heraldry. Although traditions about and reported sightings of mermen are less common than those of mermaids, they are in folklore generally assumed to co-exist with their female counterparts. The male and the female collectively are sometimes referred to as merfolk or merpeople.\nThe Western concept of mermaids as beautiful, seductive singers may have been influenced by the sirens of Greek mythology, which were originally half-birdlike, but came to be pictured as half-fishlike in the Christian era. Historical accounts of mermaids, such as those reported by Christopher Columbus during his exploration of the Caribbean, may have been sightings of manatees or similar aquatic mammals. While there is no evidence that mermaids exist outside folklore, reports of mermaid sightings continue to the present day.\nMermaids have been a popular subject of art and literature in recent centuries, such as in Hans Christian Andersen's literary fairy tale \"The Little Mermaid\" (1837). They have subsequently been depicted in operas, paintings, books, comics, animation, and live-action films.\nEtymologies.\nThe English word \"mermaid\" has its earliest-known attestation in Middle English (Chaucer, \"Nun's Priest's Tale\", c. 1390). The compound word is formed from \"mere\" (sea), and \"maid\".\nMermin.\nAnother English word \"\u2020mermin\" (headword in the OED) for 'siren or mermaid' is older, though now obsolete. It derives from Old English , ad. 'sea' + 'female slave', earliest attestation , as a gloss for \"siren\", in \"Corpus Glossary\" (c. 725). \nA Middle English example in a bestiary (dated to 1275\u20131300) is indeed a 'mermaid', part maiden, part fish-like \nIts Old High German cognate is known from biblical glosses and Physiologus.\nThe Middle High German cognate ', (mod. German \"\"), \"mermaid\", is attested in epics, and the one in \"Rabenschlacht\" is a great-grandmother of Wittich; this same figure appears in an Old Swedish text a ', and in Old Norse a (\"si\u00f3kona\" [sic.]; \"sea-woman\").\nOld Norse , masculine noun, is also listed as cognate to \"\u2020mermin\", as well as ON , modern Icelandic , and modern Norwegian \"marm\u00e6le\".\nMerewif.\nOld English is another related term, and appears once in reference not so much to a mermaid but a certain sea hag, and not well-attested later.\nIts MHG cognate , also defined as \"\" in modern German with perhaps \"merwoman\" a valid English definition. The word is attested, among other medieval epics, in the \"Nibelungenlied\", and rendered \"merwoman\", \"mermaid\", \"water sprite\", or other terms; the two in the story are translated as ON (\"sea-women\").\nOrigins.\nThe siren of Ancient Greek mythology became conflated with mermaids during the medieval period. Some European Romance languages still use cognate terms for \"siren\" to denote the mermaid, e.g., French and Spanish and Italian \"\".\nSirens.\nIn the early Greek period, the sirens were conceived of as human-headed birds, but by the classical period, the Greeks sporadically depicted the siren as part fish in art.\nMedieval sirens as mermaids.\nThe siren's part-fish appearance became increasingly popular during the Middle Ages. The traits of the classical sirens, such as using their beautiful song as a lure as told by Homer, have often been transferred to mermaids.\nThis change of the medieval siren from bird to fish were thought by some to be the influence of Germanic myth, later expounded in literary legends of Lorelei and Undine; though a dissenting comment is that parallels are not limited to Teutonic culture.\nTextual attestations.\nThe earliest text describing the siren as fish-tailed occurs in the \"Liber Monstrorum de diversis generibus\" (seventh to mid-eighth century), which described sirens as \"sea girls\" () whose beauty in form and sweet song allure seafarers, but beneath the human head and torso, have the scaly tail-end of a fish with which they can navigate the sea.\n\"Sirens are mermaids\" (Old High German/Early ) may be suggested in the aforementioned Old German \"Physiologus\" (eleventh century).\nThe Middle English bestiary (mid-13th century) clearly means \"mermaid\" when it explains the siren to be a \"mereman\", stating that she has a body and breast like that of a maiden but joined, at the navel, by a body part which is definitely fish, with fins growing out of her.\nOld French verse bestiaries (e.g. Philipp de Thaun's version, written c. 1121\u20131139) also accommodated by stating that a part of the siren may be bird or fish.\nIconographic attestations.\nIn a ninth-century \"Physiologus\" manufactured in France (Fig., top left), the siren was illustrated as a \"woman-fish\", i.e., mermaid-like, despite being described as bird-like in the text.\nThe Bodleian bestiary dated 1220\u201312 also pictures a group of fish-tailed mermaid-like sirens (Fig. bottom), contradicting its text which likens it to a winged fowl () down to their feet.\nIn the interim, the siren as pure mermaid was becoming commonplace, particularly in the so-called \"Second Family\" Latin bestiaries, as represented in one of the early manuscripts classified into this group (Additional manuscript 11283, c. 1170\u20131180s. Fig., top right).\nMirror and comb.\nWhile the siren holding a fish was a commonplace theme, the siren in bestiaries were also sometimes depicted holding the comb, or the mirror.\nThe comb and mirror became a persistent symbol of the siren-mermaid.\nIn the Christian moralizing context (e.g the bestiaries), the mermaid's mirror and comb were held as the symbol of vanity.\nOther Greek mythical figures.\nThe sea-monsters Scylla and Charybdis, who lived near the sirens, were also female and had some fishlike attributes. Though Scylla's violence is contrasted with the sirens' seductive ways by certain classical writers, Scylla and Charybdis lived near the sirens' domain. In Etruscan art before the sixth century BC, Scylla was portrayed as a mermaid-like creature with two tails. This may be tied to images of two-tailed mermaids ranging from ancient times to modern depictions, and is sometimes attached to the later character of Melusine. A sporadic example of sirens as mermaids (tritonesses) in Early Greek art (third century BC), can be explained as the contamination of the siren myth with Scylla and Charybdis.\nThe female Oceanids, Nereids and Naiads are mythical water nymphs, although they were generally depicted without fish tails. \"Nereid\" and \"nymph\" have also been applied to actual mermaid-like marine creatures purported to exist, from Pliny (cf. \u00a7Roman Lusitania and Gaul) and onwards. Jane Ellen Harrison (1882) has speculated that the mermaids or tritonesses of Greek and Roman mythology may have been brought from the Middle East, possibly transmitted by Phoenician mariners.\nThe Greek god Triton had two fish tails instead of legs. The prophetic sea deity Glaucus was also depicted with a fish tail.\nAccording to Dorothy Dinnerstein, human-animal hybrids such as mermaids and minotaurs convey the emergent understanding of ancient peoples that humans were both one with and different from animals:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;[Human] nature is internally inconsistent, that our continuities with, and our differences from, the earth's other animals are mysterious and profound; and in these continuities, and these differences, lie both a sense of strangeness on earth and the possible key to a way of feeling at home here.\nAncient Middle Eastern mythology.\nKulull\u00fb.\nDepictions of entities with the upper bodies of humans and the tails of fish appear in Mesopotamian artwork from the Old Babylonian Period onwards, on cylinder seals. These figures are usually mermen (\"kulull\u00fb\"), but mermaids do occasionally appear. The name for the mermaid figure may have been \"*kuliltu\", meaning \"fish-woman\". Such figures were used in Neo-Assyrian art as protective figures and were shown in both monumental sculpture and in small, protective figurines.\nSyrian mermaid goddess.\nA mermaid-like goddess, identified by Greek and Roman writers as Derceto or Atargatis, was worshipped at Ashkelon. In a myth recounted by Diodorus Siculus in the first century BC, Derceto gave birth to a child from an affair. Ashamed, she abandoned the child in the desert and drowned herself in a lake, only to be transformed into a human-headed fish. The child, Semiramis, was fed by doves and survived to become a queen.\nIn the second century, Lucian described seeing a Phoenician statue of Derceto with the upper body of a woman and the tail of a fish. He noted the contrast with the grand statue located at her Holy City (Hierapolis Bambyce), which appeared entirely human.\nIn the myth, Semiramis's first husband is named Onnes. Some scholars have compared this to the earlier Mesopotamian myth of Oannes, one of the \"apkallu\" or seven sages described as fish-men in cuneiform texts. While Oannes was a servant of the water deity Ea, having gained wisdom from the god, English writer Arthur Waugh understood Oannes to be equivalent to Ea, and proposed that surely \"Oannes had a fish-tailed wife\" and descendants, with Atargatis being one deity thus descended, \"through the mists of time\".\nDiodorus's chronology of Queen Semiramis resembles the feats of Alexander the Great (campaigns to India, etc.), and Diodorus may have woven the Macedonian king's material via some unnamed source. There is a mermaid legend attached to Alexander the Great's sister, but this is of post-medieval vintage (see below).\nRational attempts at explanation.\nSometime before 546 BC, Milesian philosopher Anaximander postulated that mankind had sprung from an aquatic animal species, a theory that is sometimes called the Aquatic Ape Theory. He thought that humans, who begin life with prolonged infancy, could not have survived otherwise.\nNaturalistic theories on the origins of the mermaid postulate that they derive from sightings of manatees, dugongs or even seals. Another theory, tangentially related to the aforementioned Aquatic Ape Theory, is that the mermaids of folklore were actually human women who trained over time to be skilled divers for things like sponges, and spent a lot of time in the sea as a result. A proponent of this theory is the British author William Bond, who has written several books about it.\nMedieval literature.\nMerwomen in Germanic literature.\nNibelungenlied.\nTwo prophetic merwomen (MHG pl.: ), Sigelinde (MHG: Sigelint) and her maternal aunt Hadeburg (MHG: Hadeburc) are bathing in the Danube River when Hagen von Tronje encounters them (\"Nibelungenlied\", \u00c2ventiure 25).\nThey are called \"sj\u00f3konar\" (\"sea women\") in the Old Norse \"\u00dei\u0111reks saga\". There is a swan maiden tale motif involved here (Hagen robs their clothing), but Grimm argued they must have actually been swan maidens, since they are described as hovering above water.\nIn any case, this brief segment became the \"foundational\" groundwork of subsequent water-nix lore and literature that developed in the Germanic sphere.\nThey are a probable source of the three Rhine maidens in Richard Wagner's opera \"Das Rheingold\". Though conceived of as swan-maidens in Wagner's 1848 scenario, the number being a threesome was suggested by the woodcut by Julius Schnorr von Carolsfeld and Eugen Napoleon Neureuther in the Pfizer edition of 1843 (fig. on the left).\nRabenschlacht.\nMiddle High German \"mereminne\" 'mermaid' is mentioned, among other epics, in the \"Rabenschlacht\" (\"Battle of Ravenna\", 13th cent.) of the Dietrich cycle. The mermaid (or undine) is named W\u00e2chilt and is the ancestress of the traitorous Wittich who carries him off at the time of peril to her \"submarine home\". This material has been found translated as a medieval \"\u00dei\u00f0reks saga\" only in a late, reworked Swedish version, i.e., one of the closing chapters of \"\u00d0i\u00f0riks saga\" (fifteenth century, also known as the \"Swedish epilogue\"). The mermaid/undine is here translated as Old Swedish .\nThe Old Norse \"\u00dei\u00f0reks saga\" proper calls the same mermaid a ( [sic.]) or \"sea-woman\". The genealogy is given in the saga: the sea-woman and Villcinus (Vilkinus), king of Scandinavia together had a son, Va\u00f0i (Wade) of (Sj\u00f3land=Sj\u00e6lland, Zealand) who was a giant (); whose son was Velent (Wayland the Smith), whose son after that was Vi\u00f0ga Velentsson (Wittich or Witige), who became a companion/champion of King \u00dei\u00f0rekr (Dietrich von Bern).\nThus the saga is an early source which associates a famed clan of merfolk with a place in Denmark, Sj\u00e6lland. This was the divided portion of Villcina-land inherited by the bastard prince Va\u00f0i/Wade according to the saga. The Swedish epilogue transposed the locations concerning the battle (from Italy to Germany), and claimed the rescued Vi\u00f0ga/Witige was brought to Sj\u00e6lland. That is to say, the crucial battle had been in Ravenna, Northern Italy in the German epic \"Rabenschlacht\"), but the battle spot was changed to Gronsport, somewhere on the Moselle, in Northern Germany in the Swedish version.\nFolklore of Britain and Ireland.\nThe Norman chapel in Durham Castle, built around 1078, has what is probably the earliest surviving artistic depiction of a mermaid in England. It can be seen on a south-facing capital above one of the original Norman stone pillars.\nMermaids appear in British folklore as unlucky omens, both foretelling disaster and provoking it. Several variants of the ballad \"Sir Patrick Spens\" depict a mermaid speaking to the doomed ships. In some versions, she tells them they will never see land again; in others, she claims they are near shore, which they are wise enough to know means the same thing. Mermaids can also be a sign of approaching rough weather, and some have been described as monstrous in size, up to .\nIn another short ballad, \"Clerk Colvill\" (Child ballad No. 42), the mermaid seduces the title character and foretells his doom. It has been surmised that in the original complete version, the man was being penalized for spurning her, though the Scandinavian counterparts that tells the complete story feature an elf-woman or elf queen rather than mermaid. In \"The Mermaid\" (Child ballad 289), her sighting forebodes a vessel's deadly shipwreck.\nMermaids have been described as able to swim up rivers to freshwater lakes. In one story, the Laird of Lorntie went to aid a woman he thought was drowning in a lake near his house; his servant pulled him back, warning that it was a mermaid, and the mermaid screamed at them that she would have killed him if it were not for his servant. But mermaids could occasionally be more beneficent; e.g., teaching humans cures for certain diseases. Mermen have been described as wilder and uglier than mermaids, with little interest in humans.\nAccording to legend a mermaid came to the Cornish village of Zennor, where she used to listen to the singing of a chorister, Matthew Trewhella. The two fell in love, and Matthew went with the mermaid to her home at Pendour Cove. On summer nights, the lovers can be heard singing together. The legend, recorded by folklorist William Bottrell, stems from a fifteenth-century mermaid carving on a wooden bench at the Church of Saint Senara in Zennor. Some tales raised the question of whether mermaids had immortal souls, answering in the negative.\nIn Scottish mythology, a \"ceasg\" is a freshwater mermaid, though little beside the term has been preserved in folklore. Mermaids from the Isle of Man, known as \"ben-varrey\", are considered more favorable toward humans than those of other regions, with various accounts of assistance, gifts and rewards. One story tells of a fisherman who carried a stranded mermaid back into the sea and was rewarded with the location of treasure. Another recounts the tale of a baby mermaid who stole a doll from a human little girl, but was rebuked by her mother and sent back to the girl with a gift of a pearl necklace to atone for the theft. A third story tells of a fishing family that made regular gifts of apples to a mermaid and was rewarded with prosperity. In Irish lore, L\u00ed Ban was a human being transformed into a mermaid. After three centuries, when Christianity came to Ireland, she was baptised.\nScandinavian folklore.\nHaffrue.\nThe mermaid corresponds to Danish and Bokm\u00e5l Norwegian , whereas merman answers to Danish/Norwegian \"havmand\".\nAs a side-note, a supposed Old Norse \"haffr\u00fa\" is the etymological source of Norman French \"havette\" for a man-snatching water-sprite, according to one linguist.\nAn early description of the \"Havfrue\", and her mate \"Havmand\", was given by the Danish Bishop Pontoppidan (1753). They were considered the mating female and male of the creature, inhabiting the North Sea, and their offspring was called (var. ), as repeated by later commentators. Though he was aware of fabulous fables being told about them, he was convinced such creature existed. But as they were non-human, he argued the term \"Havmand\" (merman) should be avoided, in favor of some coined term such as sea-ape (). He also knowingly employed Old Norwegian/Old Norse \"maryge\" [sic.] and \"hafstrambe\" [sic.] as the Norwegian names of the mermaid and merman respectively.\nThe Icelandic cognate form is ' with several synonyms, though instead of these the commonly used term today is '.\nThe Faroese forms are \"\" (). The Swedish form is , with other synonyms such as , or ('sea-fairy', the maritime counterpart of the forest ).\nOther aliases.\nThe terms \"marg\u00fdgur\" or \"havg\u00fdgur\" as aliases for mermaid were apparently current among the populace in modern-age Iceland, according to J\u00f3n \u00c1rnason alongside the \"marbendill\" (modern Icelandic for ON \"marmennill\") Benjamin Thorpe (1851) writing on Norwegian folklore gave \"margygr\" for mermaid (and \"marmennill\" for merman) as Norwegian folk terms, but these are interpolations, which the source, Andreas Faye's \"Norske sagn\" (1833), only side-noted as occurrences of old terms in medieval literature.\nGeneral characteristics.\nThe beautiful \"havfrue\" of Scandinavia may be benevolent or malicious, and legends about her abducting maidens (cf. infra) is given as a case of point for her malice. \nIt is said the \"havfrue\" will avenge harm done to it, as in the Norwegian anecdote of one who was lured near the ship, and had her hand cruelly lopped off on the gunwale. She caused a storm that nearly drowned the wicked sailor.\nOmen, prophecy and wisdom.\nThe appearance/sighting alone betides an impending storm. Norwegians do not wish to see the havfrue, as she heralds storm or bad weather (Norway). The appearance of the \"sj\u00f6r\u00e5\" forebodes a storm or poor catch in Swedish tradition, much as the appearance of the skogsr\u00e5 (wood-nymph) presages poor catch for the hunter. According to the superstitions of Swedish fishermen, if one saw a \"sj\u00f6r\u00e5\" who was harbinger of tempest and bad catch, one should not tell his comrades but strike flint against steel to light a spark.\nIn other cases the Scandinavian mermaid is considered to be prophetic. The tale type \"The Mermaid's Message\" (, ML 4060) is recognized as a Migratory Legend, i.e., a group of tales found in Scandinavia with parallels found elsewhere, according to the scheme devised by Reidar Thoralf Christiansen. This may not necessarily involve the mermaid's spaeing, and in the following example of this ML type tale, she merely imparts wisdom: A fisherman who performs favors and earns the privilege to pose three questions to a mermaid. He inquires about the most suitable material for a flail, to which she answers calf's hide, of course, and tells him he should have asked about how to brew water (into beer), which would have benefited him more greatly.\nMerfolk as abductors.\nThe Swedish ballad \"Hafsfrun\" (\u2248\"Havsfruns t\u00e4rna\", SMB 23, TSB A 51) is an instance where a mermaid kidnaps a human girl at age fifteen, and when the girl's brother accomplishes the rescue, the mermaid declares she would have cracked her neck if she knew she would be thus betrayed. The Swedish merman Hafsman[nen] steals a human woman to become his bride according to folklore.\nMarmaele.\nAs aforementioned, the mermaid () takes the merman () for husband, and produce children called \"marm\u00e6ler\" (sing. , \"sea-talkers\"), which the fishermen sometimes bring home to gain insight into the future. Early sources say that Norwegian fishermen who capture the \"marm\u00e6te\" or \"marm\u00e6le\" may bring them home but do not dare keep it for more than 24 hours before turning them back into the sea whence they found it.\nMarg\u00fdgr.\nJ\u00f3n \u00c1rnason describes the \"marg\u00fdgur\" as yellow-haired woman who is fish from the waist down, who drags careless seamen to the depths of the sea. However, \"margygr\" literally means something like \"mer-troll\", and in medieval tradition, the \"margygr\" is more of a \"sea monster\" or \"sea-ogress\".\nAccording to a version of the \"Saga of St. Olaf\" (Olaf II of Norway) the king encountered a \"margygr\" whose singing lulled voyagers to sleep causing them to drown and whose high-pitched shrieks drove men insane. Her physical appearance is described thus: \"She has a head like a horse, with ears erect and distended nostrils, big green eyes and fearful jaws. She has shoulders like a horse and hands in front; but behind she resembles a serpent\". This \"margygr\" was also said to be furry like a seal, and gray-colored.\nWestern European folklore.\nMelusine is a mermaid-like character from European folklore, cursed to take the form of a serpent from the waist down. Later depictions sometimes changed this to a fish tail. At some point, possibly in the late nineteenth century, her name became attached to the two-tailed mermaid of heraldry.\nThe alchemist Paracelsus's treatise \"A Book on Nymphs, Sylphs, Pygmies, and Salamanders, and on the Other Spirits\" (1566) spawned the idea that the water elemental (or water sprite) could acquire an immortal soul through marriage with a human; this led to the writing of De la Motte Fouqu\u00e9's novella \"Undine\", and eventually to the famous literary mermaid tale, Hans Christian Andersen's \"The Little Mermaid\".\nDuring the Romanesque period, mermaids were often associated with lust.\nByzantine and Ottoman Greek folklore.\nThe conception of the \"siren\" as both a mermaid-like creature and part bird-like persisted in Byzantine Greece for some time. The \"Physiologus\" began switching the illustration of the siren as that a mermaid, as in a version dated to the ninth century. The tenth century Byzantine Greek dictionary \"Suda\" still favored the avian description.\nThere is a modern Greek legend that Alexander the Great's sister Thessalonike turned into a mermaid () after her death, living in the Aegean. She would ask the sailors on any ship she encountered only one question: \"Is King Alexander alive?\",() to which the correct answer was: \"He lives and reigns and conquers the world\" (Greek: \"\u0396\u03b5\u03b9 \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03b2\u03b1\u03c3\u03b9\u03bb\u03b5\u03cd\u03b5\u03b9 \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03c4\u03bf\u03bd \u03ba\u03cc\u03c3\u03bc\u03bf\u03bd \u03ba\u03c5\u03c1\u03b9\u03b5\u03cd\u03b5\u03b9\"). This answer would please her, and she would accordingly calm the waters and bid the ship farewell. Any other answer would enrage her, and she would stir up a terrible storm, dooming the ship and every sailor on board. This legend derives from an Alexander romance entitled the \"Phyll\u00e1da tou Megal\u00e9xandrou\" () dating to the Ottoman Greece period, first printed in 1680.\nEastern Europe.\nRusalkas are the Slavic counterpart of the Greek sirens and naiads, often seducing sailors to their doom. The nature of rusalkas varies among folk traditions, but according to ethnologist D.K. Zelenin they all share a common element: they are the restless spirits of the unclean dead. They are usually the ghosts of young women who died a violent or untimely death, either by murder or suicide, before their wedding, especially by drowning. Rusalkas are said to inhabit lakes and rivers. They appear as beautiful young women with long pale green hair and pale skin, suggesting a connection with floating weeds and days spent underwater in faint sunlight. They can be seen after dark, dancing together under the moon and calling out to young men by name, luring them to the water and drowning them. The characterization of rusalkas as both desirable and treacherous is prevalent in Russia, Ukraine and Belarus, and was emphasized by nineteenth-century Russian authors.\nIn \"Sadko\" (), a Russian oral epic poem (\"bylina\"), the title character\u2014an adventurer, merchant, and \"gusli\" musician from Novgorod\u2014lives for some time in the underwater court of the Sea Tsar and marries his daughter, Chernava, before finally returning home. The tale inspired such works as the poem \"Sadko\" by Alexei Tolstoy, the opera \"Sadko\" composed by Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov, and the painting \"Sadko\" by Ilya Repin.\nChinese folklore.\nA merfolk race called the Di people are described as populating its own nation in the \"Shanhaijing\" (\"Classic of Mountains and Seas\") compilation of Chinese geography and mythology, dating from the fourth century BC. The ancient work also included several types of human-headed fish, such as the \"chiru\" or \"red ru fish\"; as well as creature with some humanlike qualities like the \"renyu\" () or \"human-fish\".\nThere is an account of the \"hairenyu\"(; literally \"sea human fish\"), given in the \"Taiping guangji\" compilation, sourced from the work entitled \"Qiawenji\" (). The female of its kind had a head like beautiful woman's, with hair like a horse's tail, and white skin like jade without scales, covered with multicolored downy hair (or peach fuzz), and legless. The male and female had sexual organs like humans, so that widows and widowers would keep them in their ponds, and the creatures could perform sexual intercourse normally as a human would.\nAn anecdote considered relevant concerns a \"renyu\" (\"human fish\") allegedly seen by the ship carrying Zha Dao (), and emissary to Korea. She had an unkempt hairdo and scarlet mane extending to the back of her elbows. Zha ordered the crew to bring her aboard with poles, but she escaped. Zha explained that she was a \"renyu\", adept at copulating with humans, and was a type of human dwelling in the sea. The anecdote in the lost \"Cuyiji\" (\"Records of Bygone Extraordinary Things\") from the Northern Song period, survives in quotes, e.g., from \"leishu\" compilation \"Gujin tushu jicheng\" ( \"Comprehensive Compendium of Illustrations and Books, Ancient and Modern\").\nKorean folklore.\nKorea is bound on three sides by the sea. In some villages near the sea in Korea, there are mysterious stories about mermaids. Mermaids have features just like humans. Kim Dam Ryeong, a mayor of the town, saved four captured mermaids from a fisherman, as recorded in the \"Eou yadam\" (\"unofficial histories\"). In Dongabaek Island of Busan is a tale of Princess Hwang-ok from Naranda, a mythical undersea kingdom of mermaids; this tale is based on the historical Heo Hwang-ok from India. Another tale concerns a mermaid named Sinjike () who warned fishermen of impending storms by singing and throwing rocks into the sea from Geomun Island. The island's residents believed her to be a goddess of the sea and that she could predict the weather.\nJapanese folklore.\nThe Japanese equivalent is . According to one dictionary, \"ningyo\" oftentimes refers to a \"half-woman and half-fish fabulous creature\", i.e., mermaid, though not necessarily female, i.e., includes mermen. Despite the dictionary's stating it has the appearance of half-woman half-fish, the creature has been pictorialized rather as a being with a human female head sitting on a body which is entirely fish-like (see fig. right).\nA famous \"ningyo\" legend concerns the Yao bikuni who is said to have partaken of the flesh of a merfolk and attained miraculous longevity and lived for centuries. It is not discernible whether the flesh was a female; a pair of translators call it \"flesh of a mermaid\" in one book, but merely a \"strange fish with a human face\" in another.\nA \"ningyo\" might be counted as a \"y\u014dkai\" since it is included in Toriyama Sekien's \"Hyakki Yagy\u014d\" series. Gender is unclear, as it is only described as a being with \"a human face, a fish body\". However, Sekien's \"ningyo\" picture actually represents a \"human-fish\" that lives in Western China, also known as the Di people Diren, according to the inscription printed alongside. They are described in the \"Classic of Mountains and Seas\" and translated as the \"Low People\" or the \"Di People\".\nIndian, Southeast Asian, and Polynesian folklore.\nIn Hinduism, Suvannamaccha (literally \"golden mermaid\") is a daughter of Ravana who also appears in the Thai and other Southeast Asian versions of Ramayana. She is a mermaid princess who tries to spoil Hanuman's plans to build a bridge to Lanka but falls in love with him instead.\nIn Cambodia, she is referred as Sovanna Maccha, a favorite for Cambodian audiences.\nIndonesia.\nIn the Javanese culture of Indonesia, Nyai Roro Kidul is a sea goddess and the Queen of the Southern Seas; the mermaid queen is said to inhabit the southern beach in Java. She has many forms; in her mermaid form, she is called Nyai Blorong.\nPhilippines.\nIn the Tagalog language mermaids are known as \"sirena\" and \"siyokoy\" respectively. The general term for mermaid among all ethnic groups is Sirena.\nIn the Philippines, mermaid concepts differ per ethnic group. Among the Pangasinense, the Binalatongan mermaid is a Queen of the sea who married the mortal Maginoo Palasipas and ruled humanity for a time. Among the Ilocano, mermaids were said to have propagated and spread through the union of the first Serena and the first Litao, a water god. Among the Bicolano, mermaids were referred as Magindara, known for their beautiful voice and vicious nature.\nIn the folktale \"Mermaid\" (Cebuano language: ) localized in Cebu and Bohol Provinces, a couple named Juan and Juana is about to have a daughter, but the pregnant wife has a constant craving for milkfish (Cebuano: ). One day his fishing caught nothing, but met a talking milkfish wearing a crown, the \"King of the Fishes\" (Cebuano: ) who offered to give him plenty every day, in exchange for the taking the child later, at 7 years of age. She was eventually swept away by the waves, and presumed lost to the king. The parents, hoping to see her again on the beach did so finally, on a moonlit night, witnessed a black haired woman with the body of a milkfish, whom they knew was Maria.\nNew Zealand.\nMermaids are characters in the myth of \"Pania of the Reef\", a well-known tale of M\u0101ori mythology.\nAfrican folklore.\nMami Water (Lit. \"Mother of the Water\") are water spirits venerated in West, Central and southern Africa, and in the African diaspora in the Caribbean and parts of North, Central and South America. They are usually female, but are sometimes male. They are regarded as diabolical beings, and are often femme fatales, luring men to their deaths. The Persian word \"\u067e\u0631\u06cc \u062f\u0631\u06cc\u0627\u06cc\u06cc\" or \"maneli\" means \"mermaid\".\nAmong the Shona of Zimbabwe, njuzu are mermaid-like spirits. The jengu, also known as the \"Itongo\" (Sea Queen), of Cameroon is sometimes depicted as half woman and half fish.\nArabian folklore.\n\"One Thousand and One Nights\".\nThe \"One Thousand and One Nights\" collection includes several tales featuring \"sea people\", such as \"Jullan\u00e2r the Sea-born and Her Son King Badr B\u00e2sim of Persia\". Unlike depictions of mermaids in other mythologies, these are anatomically identical to land-bound humans, differing only in their ability to breathe and live underwater. They can (and do) interbreed with land humans, and the children of such unions have the ability to live underwater. In the tale \"Abdullah the Fisherman and Abdullah the Merman\", the protagonist Abdullah the Fisherman gains the ability to breathe underwater and discovers an underwater society that is portrayed as an inverted reflection of society on land. The underwater society follows a form of primitive communism where concepts like money and clothing do not exist. In \"The Adventures of Bulukiya\", the protagonist Bulukiya's quest for the herb of immortality leads him to explore the seas, where he encounters societies of mermaids.\nAmericas folklore.\nThe Neo-Ta\u00edno nations of the Caribbean identify a mermaid called \"Aycayia\" with attributes of the goddess Jagua and the hibiscus flower of the majagua tree \"Hibiscus tiliaceus\". In modern Caribbean culture, there are a number of mermaids that are derived from West African originals and transplanted by enslaved West Africans. These include Watramama in Suriname and Guyana, Mamadjo in Grenada, Yemanya or Yemaya in Brazil and Cuba, Erzulie in Haiti, and Lamant\u00e9 in Martinique. There is a mermaid recognized as a Haitian \"vodou\" loa called \"Lasir\u00e8n\" (from the French , \"the mermaid\"), representing wealth, beauty and romance, but also the possibility of death.\nIara and Ipupiara.\nIn Brazilian folklore, the iara, also known as \"m\u00e3e-d'agua\" (\"lady/mother of the water\") is a water-dwelling beauty whom fishermen are prone to fall prey to. According to eighteenth-century sources, she is a long-haired woman who enchant men by night, and those who succumb die, \"drowned by passion\". Folklore also blamed disappearances of men on the Iara who lured them singing in the indigenous language.\nThe ascribed hair and eye color differs depending on the tradition in various regions. According to the tale of the Manaus tribe, she has hair of the color of the pau d'arco tree's flowers (var. green hair) and pink skin, while she is black-haired according to some. Other commentators insist Iara is a \"beautiful white woman who lives in a river\", reputedly golden-haired, and blue-eyed though the blond, blue-eyed image was not attested until after the mid-nineteenth century, to the best knowledge of Camara Cascudo. Cascudo in his earlier writing contended that though the Iara was rooted in two indigenous beings, the water-devil Ipupiara (cf. below) and the Cobra-Grande, he also saw the combining of the Portuguese lore of the Enchanted Moura (moorish girl), who was dark-skinned. The Iara became increasingly regarded as a woman-fish, after the image of the European sirens/mermaids.\nIt is often argued that the legends of the Iara developed around the eighteenth century out of the indigenous myth of the Ipupiara among the Tupinamb\u00e1 people. The Ipupiara was originally conceived of as a male water-dweller that carried fishermen to the bottom, devouring their mouths, nose, fingertips and genitals. European writers during the age of exploration disseminated the myth, but the Gandavo (1576) included an illustration of \"Hipupi\u00e0ra\" with female breasts. Subsequently the Jesuit Cardim wrote that the \"Igpupi\u00e0ra\" also consisted of females that look like women with long hair. Though somewhat vague in the case of Gandavo, Cardim had injected Christian opinion of relegating the role of emasculating men to the female kind. Later with the introduction of African slaves, the Yoruba myth of Iemanj\u00e1 was admixed into the telling.\nAlamoa.\nThe Alamoa is a well known legend in the island of Fernando de Noronha, northeast of the Brazilian mainland. An alluring half-naked woman, she who would seduced men by night, and the charmed lovers who followed her end up falling off the island cliff, off Pico hill. Again, modern commentary paints her as a \"beautiful white woman ()\", which would be consistent with the name Alamoa being an older form of , which now means \"blonde, fair-skinned woman\" whereas older literature describes her as fulvous or tawny (), though dressed in white, as according to Francisco Augusto Pereira da Costa (d. 1923). According to one telling, on Friday nights, the rock of Pico splits and emits a light beam, followed by Alamoa's appearance, attracting men; but she will then transform into skull and skeleton, resulting in disappearances, except cries of terror can be occasionally heard. The Alamoa evidently maintains an underwater palace as well. These elements (skull, light, palace) are lacking in European (Dutch) lore, though general similarity to Holland's mermaid has been suggested.\nReported sightings.\nRoman Lusitania and Gaul.\nIn his \"Natural History\" 9.4.9\u201311, Pliny the Elder, remarked that a triton (merman) was seen off the coast of Olisipo (present-day Lisbon, Portugal), and it bore the physical appearance in accordance with common notion of the triton, according to a deputation from Lisbon who reported it to Emperor Tiberus. One nereid was sighted earlier on the same (Lisbon) coast. Pliny remarks that contrary to popular notion, the true nereids are not smooth-skinned in their human-like portions, but covered with scales all over the body. Their mournful songs at death have also been heard by the coastal inhabitants. Also, multiple nereids had washed up on the shore according to the legatus/governor of Gaul, who informed the late Emperor Augustus about it in a letter.\nSixteenth-century Swedish writer Olaus Magnus quotes the same passage from Pliny, and further notes that the nereid are said to utter \"dismal moans (wailings) at the hour of her death\", thus observing a connection to the legend of sea-nymphs and the sister Fates whose clashing cymbals and flute tunes could be heard on shore. Olaus in a later passage states that the nereids (tr. \"mermaids\") are known to \"sing plaintively\", in general.\nIt has been conjectured that these carcasses of nereids washed up on shore were \"presumably seals\".\nAge of Exploration Americas and polar frontiers.\nIn 1493, sailing off the coast of Hispaniola, Christopher Columbus spotted three mermaids () which he said were not as beautiful as they are represented due to masculine features in their faces. He is widely believed to have seen manatees, not mermaids. During Henry Hudson's second voyage on 15 June 1608, members of his crew reported sighting a mermaid in the Arctic Ocean, either in the Norwegian or Barents Seas. Dutch explorer David Danell during his expeditions to Greenland in 1652\u201354 claimed to have spotted a mermaid with \"flowing hair and very beautiful\", though the crew failed to capture it.\nColonial Brazil.\nDanish physician and natural historian Thomas Bartholin wrote about a mermaid specimen caught in Brazil (probably a manatee) and subsequently dissected at Leiden. Though referred to in the text as a \"sea-man\" (\"homo marinus\") from Brazil, the account was accompanied by an engraved drawing captioned \"Sirene\", whose appearance was that of a humanoid female with bared breasts (a mermaid). The specimen's body was deformed and \"without the sign of a tail\", matching the drawing. And \"a membrane [that] join [the fingers] together\" is also reflected in the drawing as well (as her webbed pair of hands/forepaws).\nThe specimen's account and illustration was later reproduced by Linnaeus, who captioned the beast \"Siren Bartholini\". Bartholin was actually not the sole proprietor of the specimen, but he came into possession of its hand and ribs, which he illustrated in his book. Based on the illustration, the \"hand\" has been determined to be the front flipper belonging to a manatee by a team of researchers. Bartholin himself had argued that it was a sea mammal closely related to seals (\"phocae\"). His rationale was that since there are several marine counterparts to land mammals e.g. \"sea-horses\", the possibility of a marine creature with striking likeness to humans could not be ruled out, though they should all be classified among seal-kind. Erasmus Francisci (Erasmus Finx, 1668) associated this Brazilian specimen with the local native lore of the \"Yupiapra\" (Ipupiara).\nDutch Formosa.\nAccording to Frederick Coyett, the last Dutch governor of Formosa (aka Taiwan), many people saw mermaids appearing in the waters near the Fort Zeelandia during Koxinga's 17th-century attack on the Dutch. The Dutch came to the waterways to search carefully, but they were gone. It was regarded as a sign of imminent disaster.\nColonial Southeast Asia.\nSeventeenth-century Visayas.\nA type of mermaid referred to as \"anthropomorphus\" or \"woman-fish\" () allegedly inhabited the Spanish-ruled Philippines, particularly in the waters around the Visayan Islands, according to contemporary writings from the seventeenth century.\nThe accounts are found in several books, on various topics from magnetism, to natural history, to ecclesiastical history.\nThese books refer to the mermaid/merman as \"piscis anthropomorphos\" (), and emphasize how human-like they appear in their upper bodies, as well as providing woodcut or etchings illustrating the male and female of the part-human part-fish creature.\nThe \"woman-fish\" (or in modern Spanish)) was the name given to the creature among the Spaniards, but the sources also state it was called \"duyon\" by the indigenous people. and it is assumed the actual creature was a dugong (according to modern translators' notes).\nSeveral of these sources mention the medical use of the woman-fish to control the flow of blood (or the four humours). It was effective for staunching the bleeding, i.e., effective against hemorrhages, according to Jonston. Other sources mention the ability to stop bleeding, e.g. Col\u00edn, who also thought that the Philippine woman-fish tasted like fatty pork. The bones were made into beads (i.e., strung together), as it was believed effective against defluxions (of the humours).\nEighteenth-century Moluccas.\nAllegedly captured in the Moluccas in the seventeenth century was the so-called \"Amboina mermaid\" (after the then Dutch Province of Ambon), which its leading researcher has referred to as Samuel Fallours's \"Sirenne\", after the man who came into possession of it and made an original painting of it in full color.\nThe painting was reproduced by Louis Renard on the \"Fish\" of the region, first published in 1719,\nIt was supposedly caught by Boeren in Ambon Province (Buru, in present-day Maluku Province), presumably around the years 1706\u20131712, or perhaps the year 1712 precisely. During this period, Fallours served briefly as soldier for the VOC (Dutch East India Company) starting June 1706, but turned associate curate (Krankbezoeker) for the Dutch Reformed Church (September 1706 to June 1712).\nFallour's mermaid with additional details were described by Fran\u00e7ois Valentijn in a 1726 book.\nThe mermaid was 59 Dutch inches () long, or 5 feet in Rhineland measures. She reportedly survived 4 days 7 hours in a water tank, and died after refusing food it was given, having uttered no intelligible sound, or issuing sounds like screechings of a mouse. Something like a straw cape (Japanese \"mino\") appears wrapped around her waist in the painting according to one commentator, but Fallours revealed in his notes that he lifted the front and back fins and \"[found] it was shaped like a woman\".\nThe mermaid was suspected to be a dugong in reality, even by contemporary scholars such as Georg Rumphius, although Valentijn was unable to believe they were the one and the same. Leading researcher Theodore W. Pietsch concurs with the dugong identification, but an ichthyologist has opined that \"I could more easily accept a small oar-fish, or another eel-like fish, rather than a dugong as a partial basis for the drawing\", noting that Renard's book carries an illustration of a plausibly realistic dugong as well.\nQing dynasty China.\nThe \"Yuezhong jianwen\" (; \"Seens and Heards\", or \"Jottings on the South of China\", 1730) contains two accounts concerning mermaids. In the first, a man captures a mermaid ( \"sea woman\") on the shore of Lantau Island (). She looks human in every respect except that her body is covered with fine hair of many colors. She cannot talk, but he takes her home and marries her. After his death, the mermaid returns to the sea where she was found. In the second story, a man sees a woman lying on the beach while his ship was anchored offshore. On closer inspection, her feet and hands appear to be webbed. She is carried to the water, and expresses her gratitude toward the sailors before swimming away.\nU.S. and Canada.\nTwo sightings were reported in Canada near Vancouver and Victoria, one from sometime between 1870 and 1890, the other from 1967. A Pennsylvania fisherman reported five sightings of a mermaid in the Susquehanna River near Marietta in June 1881.\nTwenty-first century.\nIn August 2009, after dozens of people reported seeing a mermaid leaping out of Haifa Bay waters and doing aerial tricks, the Israeli coastal town of Kiryat Yam offered a $1\u00a0million award for proof of its existence.\nIn February 2012, work on two reservoirs near Gokwe and Mutare in Zimbabwe stopped when workers refused to continue, stating that mermaids had hounded them away from the sites. It was reported by Samuel Sipepa Nkomo, the water resources minister.\nHoaxes and show exhibitions.\nManufactured merfolk specimens.\nA celebrated example of mermaid hoax was the Fiji mermaid exhibited in London in 1822 and later in America by P. T. Barnum in 1842; in this case an investigator claims to have traced the mermaid's manufacture to a Japanese fisherman.\nFake mermaids made in China and the Malay Archipelago out of monkey and fish parts were imported into Europe by Dutch traders since the mid-sixteenth century, and their manufactures are thought to go back earlier. The manufacture of mermaids from monkey and fish parts also occurred in Japan, especially in the Ky\u016bsh\u016b region, as a souvenir industry targeting foreigners. M\u014dri Baien painted full color illustrations of such a compositely manufactured \"ningyo\" specimen in his ichthyological tract (1825). For much of the Edo Period, Nagasaki (in Ky\u016bsh\u016b) was the only trade port open to foreign countries, and the only place where non-Japanese aliens could reside. Jan Cock Blomhoff, the Dutch East India Company director stationed in Dejima, Nagasaki is known to have acquired merfolk mummies; these and other specimens are now held in the National Museum of Ethnology in Leiden, Netherlands.\nThe equivalent industry in Europe was the Jenny Haniver made from dried rays.\nIn the middle of the seventeenth century, John Tradescant the elder created a wunderkammer (called Tradescant's Ark) in which he displayed, among other things, a \"mermaid's hand\".\nMermaid shows.\nScantily clad women placed in watertanks and impersonating mermaids performed at the 1939 New York World's Fair. It was part of the \"Dream of Venus\" installation by Surrealist artist Salvador Dal\u00ed. The mermaid interacted with Oscar the Obscene Octopus, and the ongoings were portrayed in E. L. Doctorow's novel \"World's Fair\".\nProfessional female divers have performed as mermaids at Florida's Weeki Wachee Springs since 1947. The state park calls itself \"The Only City of Live Mermaids\" and was extremely popular in the 1960s, drawing almost one million tourists per year. Most of the current performers work part-time while attending college, and all are certified Scuba divers. They wear fabric tails and perform aquatic ballet (while holding their breath) for an audience in an underwater stage with glass walls. Children often ask if the \"mermaids\" are real. The park's PR director says, \"Just like with Santa Claus or any other mythical character, we always say yes. We're not going to tell them they're not real\".\nThe Ama are Japanese skin divers, predominantly women, who traditionally dive for shellfish and seaweed wearing only a loincloth and who have been in action for at least 2,000 years. Starting in the twentieth century, they have increasingly been regarded as a tourist attraction. They operate off reefs near the shore, and some perform for sightseers instead of diving to collect a harvest. They have been romanticized as mermaids.\nScientific inquiry.\nThe topic of mermaids in earnest has arisen in several instances of scientific scrutiny, including a biological assessment of the unlikelihood of the supposed evolutionary biology of the mermaid on the popular marine science website \"DeepSeaNews\". Five of the primary reasons listed as to why mermaids do not fit current evolutionary understanding are thermoregulation (adaptations for regulating body heat); evolutionary mismatch; reproductive challenges; digestive differences between mammals and fish; and lack of physical evidence. Mermaids were discussed tongue-in-cheek in a scientific article by University of Washington emeritus oceanographer Karl Banse, written as a parody.\nOmens.\nThe mermaid is a harbinger of shipwreck in English-Scottish balladry, though the attestation (Child ballad 289), dates no older than the 18th century. No analogues were found by Child outside the English language, though versions were transmitted to America. In Norway the was considered the harbinger of \"storm and bad weather\" The notion of the mermaid's signifying bad omen is both Western and Eastern. A number of such omens were recorded in Japan by the Kamakura shogunate, for example, the entry in the \"Azuma kagami\" for 1247 (H\u014dji 1) records a beaching of a \"big fish\" (as it was called here), tied to the Battle of H\u014dji the same year.\nArts, entertainment, and media.\nLiterature.\nThe best-known example of mermaids in literature is probably Hans Christian Andersen's fairy tale, \"The Little Mermaid\", first published in 1837. The title character, youngest of the Merman-king's daughters, falls in love with a human prince and also longs for an eternal soul like humans, despite the shorter lifespan. The two cravings are intertwined: only by achieving true love will her soul bind with a human's and become everlasting. But the mermaid's fish-tail poses an insurmountable obstacle for enticing humans, and a sea-witch offers a potion to transform into human form, at a price (the mermaid's tongue and beautiful voice). The mermaid endures the excruciating pain of having human legs, and despite her inability to speak, almost succeeds in wedding the prince, but for a twist of fate. The mermaid is doomed unless she stabs the prince with a magic knife on his wedding night. She refuses to harm him and dies the mermaid way, dissolving into foam. However, her selflessness has earned her a second chance at salvation, and she is resurrected as an air spirit.\nAndersen's works has been translated into over 100 languages. One of the main literary influences for Andersen's mermaid was \"Undine\", an earlier German novella about a water nymph who could only obtain an immortal soul by marrying a human. Andersen's heroine inspired a bronze sculpture in Copenhagen harbour and influenced Western literary works such as Oscar Wilde's \"The Fisherman and His Soul\" and H. G. Wells' \"The Sea Lady\".\nArt and music.\nSculptures and statues of mermaids can be found in many countries and cultures, with over 130 public art mermaid statues across the world. Countries with public art mermaid sculptures include Russia, Finland, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Denmark, Norway, England, Scotland, Ireland, Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, France, Spain, Italy, Austria, Switzerland, Greece, Turkey, India, China, Thailand, South Korea, Japan, Guam, Australia, New Zealand, Brazil, Ecuador, Colombia, Mexico, the Cayman Islands, Mexico, Saudi Arabia (Jeddah), the United States (including Hawaii and the U.S. Virgin Islands) and Canada.\nAn influential image was created by the Pre-Raphaelite painter John William Waterhouse, from 1895 to 1905, entitled \"A Mermaid\" (Cf. figure, top of page). An example of late British Academy-style artwork, the piece debuted to considerable acclaim (and secured Waterhouse's place as a member of the Royal Academy), but disappeared into a private collection and did not resurface until the 1970s. It is currently once again in the Royal Academy's collection. Waterhouse's mermaid grooms her hair with comb and mirror, the stereotypical implements of the mermaid, likely designed to portray her as temptress, and her red hair (auburn hair) is a match for the hair colour of Venus. Waterhouses's \"The Siren\" (1900) also depicts the siren as a mermaid of sorts, representing the \"femme fatale\" drawing men to destruction. In the modern age of course, the word \"siren\" is used as a synonym of \"femme fatale\".\nMusical depictions of mermaids include those by Felix Mendelssohn in his \"Fair Melusina\" overture and the three \"Rhine daughters\" in Richard Wagner's opera \"Der Ring des Nibelungen\". Lorelei, the name of a Rhine mermaid immortalized in the Heinrich Heine poem of that name, has become a synonym for a siren. \"The Weeping Mermaid\" is an orchestral piece by Taiwanese composer Fan-Long Ko.\nMotion pictures.\nFilm depictions include \"Miranda\" (1948), \n\"Night Tide\" (1961), \nthe romantic comedy \"Splash\" (1984), \nand \"Aquamarine\" (2006).\nIn \"She Creature\" (2001), two carnival workers abduct a mermaid in Ireland c.\u20091900 and attempt to transport her to America. \nThe film \"\" makes many uses of the mermaid theme.\nDisney's musical animated version of Andersen's tale, \"The Little Mermaid\", was released in 1989. Notable changes to Andersen's story include removing the religious aspects of the fairy tale, including the mermaid's quest to obtain an immortal soul. The sea-witch herself replaces the princess to whom the prince becomes engaged, using the mermaid's voice to prevent her from obtaining the prince's love. However, on their wedding day the plot is revealed and the sea-witch is vanquished. The knife motif is not used in the film, which ends with the mermaid and the prince marrying.\nHeraldry.\nIn heraldry, the charge of a mermaid is commonly represented with a comb and a mirror, and blazoned as a \"mermaid in her vanity\". In addition to vanity, mermaids are also a symbol of eloquence.\nMermaids appear with greater frequency as heraldic devices than mermen do. A merman and a mermaid are depicted on the coat of arms of Schouwen-Duiveland. A mermaid appears on the arms of the University of Birmingham, in addition to those of several British families.\nA mermaid with two tails is called a melusine. Melusines appear in German heraldry, and less frequently in the British version. A shield and sword-wielding mermaid (\"Syrenka\") is on the official coat of arms of Warsaw. Images of a mermaid have symbolized Warsaw on its arms since the middle of the fourteenth century. Several legends associate Triton of Greek mythology with the city, which may have been the origin of the mermaid's association.\nThe Cusack family crest includes a mermaid wielding a sword, as depicted on a memorial stone for Sir Thomas Cusack (1490\u20131571).\nMermaids appear on the coat of arms of Ustka, Bia\u0142obrzegi and Bia\u0142obrzegi County (Poland), Seeboden am Millst\u00e4tter See (Austria), Bray (Ireland), Santa Colomba de Curue\u00f1o, Ruente, Bertizarana, Villanueva de la Serena (Spain), P\u00e4ij\u00e4t-H\u00e4me (Finland), \u00c5sg\u00e5rdstrand (Norway), Royat, Xammes, Lancieux, Erquy, Chens-sur-L\u00e9man, Didenheim, Wimereux (France), Eemsmond, Makkum, Uithuizermeeden (Netherlands), Waasmunster (Belgium), and Westerdeichstrich (Germany). The city of Norfolk, Virginia also uses a mermaid as a symbol. The personal coat of arms of Micha\u00eblle Jean, former Governor General of Canada, features two mermaids as supporters.\nFandom.\nInterest in mermaid costuming has grown with the popularity of fantasy cosplay, as well as the availability of inexpensive monofins used in the construction of these costumes. The costumes are typically designed to be used while swimming, in an activity known as mermaiding. Mermaid fandom conventions have also been held.\nExplanatory notes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nGeneral and cited references.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He was famous for his gravelly voice, and credited it with his success, saying, \"It's kept meat and potatoes on the table for years for Wolfman and Wolfwoman. A couple of shots of whiskey helps it. I've got that nice raspy sound.\"\nEarly life.\nSmith was born in Brooklyn, New York City, on January 21, 1938, the younger of two children of Anson Weston Smith, an Episcopal Sunday school teacher, writer, editor, and executive vice president of \"Financial World\", and his wife, Rosamond Small. He lived on 12th Street and 4th Avenue and went to Manual Training High School in the Park Slope section. His parents divorced while he was a child. To help keep him out of trouble, his father bought him a large Trans-Oceanic radio, and Smith became an avid fan of R&amp;B music and the disc jockeys who played it, including Douglas \"Jocko\" Henderson of Philadelphia; New York's \"Dr. Jive\", Tommy Smalls; the \"Moon Dog\" from Cleveland, Alan Freed; and Nashville's \"John R.\" Richbourg, who later became his mentor. After selling encyclopedias and Fuller brushes door-to-door, Smith attended the National Academy of Broadcasting in Washington, D.C.\nBroadcasting career.\nAfter graduating from NAB in 1960, Smith began working as \"Daddy Jules\" at WYOU in Newport News, Virginia. When the station format changed to \"beautiful music\", he became known as \"Roger Gordon and Music in Good Taste\". In 1962, Smith moved to country music station KCIJ/1050 in Shreveport, Louisiana, as the station manager and morning disc jockey, \"Big Smith with the Records\". He married Lucy \"Lou\" Lamb in 1961, and they had two children.\nCleveland's Alan Freed had originally called himself the \"Moon Dog\" after New York City street musician Moondog. Freed both adopted this name and used a recorded howl to give his early broadcasts a unique character. Smith's adaptation of the Moondog theme was to call himself Wolfman Jack and add his own sound effects. The character was based in part on the manner and style of bluesman Howlin' Wolf. At KCIJ, he first began to develop his famous alter ego, Wolfman Jack. According to author Philip A. Lieberman, Smith's \"Wolfman\" persona \"derived from Smith's love of horror films and his shenanigans as a 'wolfman' with his two young nephews. The 'Jack' nickname was taken from the 'hipster' lingo of the 1950s, as in 'Take a page from my book, Jack', or the more popular, 'Hit the road, Jack.'\"\nIn 1963, Smith took his act to the border when Inter-American Radio Advertising's Ramon Bosquez hired him and sent him to the studio and transmitter site of XERF-AM at Ciudad Acu\u00f1a in Mexico, a station across the U.S.-Mexico border from Del Rio, Texas, whose high-powered border blaster signal could be picked up across much of the United States. In an interview with writer Tom Miller, Smith described the reach of the XERF signal: \"We had the most powerful signal in North America. Birds dropped dead when they flew too close to the tower. A car driving from New York to L.A. would never lose the station.\"\nMany of the Mexican border stations broadcast at 150,000 watts, three times the U.S. limit, meaning that their signals were picked up all over North America, and at night as far away as Europe and the Soviet Union. At XERF, Smith developed his signature style (with phrases such as, \"Who's this on the Wolfman telephone?\") and widespread fame. The border stations made money by renting time to Pentecostal preachers and psychics, and by taking 50% of the profit from anything sold by mail order. The Wolfman did pitches for dog food, weight-loss pills, weight-gain pills, rose bushes, and baby chicks. Even a pill called Florex, which was supposed to enhance one's sex drive, was sold. \"Some zing for your ling nuts\", the Wolfman would say.\nXERB was the original call sign for the border blaster station in Rosarito Beach, Mexico, which was branded as The Mighty 1090 in Hollywood, California. The station boasted \"50,000 watts of Boss Soul Power\". That station continues to broadcast under the call sign XEPRS-AM. XERB also had an office in the rear of a small strip mall on Third Avenue in Chula Vista, California just 10 minutes from the Tijuana\u2013San Diego border crossing. The Wolfman was rumored to actually broadcast from this location during the early to mid-1960s. Smith left Mexico after eight months and moved to Minneapolis to run station KUXL. Although Smith was managing a Minneapolis radio station, he was still broadcasting as Wolfman Jack on XERF via taped shows that he sent to the station.\nMissing the excitement, however, Wolfman returned to border radio to run XERB, and opened an office on Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles in January 1966. He recorded his shows in Los Angeles and shipped his tapes across the border into Mexico, where they would then be transmitted across the U.S.\nIn 1971, the Mexican government, under pressure from the Roman Catholic church, banned the Pentecostal preachers from the radio, taking away 80% of XERB's revenue. Smith then moved to station KDAY 1580 in Los Angeles, which could only pay him a fraction of his former XERB income. Smith capitalized on his fame, though, by editing his old XERB tapes and selling them to radio stations everywhere, becoming one of the first rock-and-roll syndicated programs (as the tapes began to age, they were eventually marketed to oldies stations). He also appeared on Armed Forces Radio from 1970 to 1986. At his peak, Wolfman Jack was heard on more than 2,000 radio stations in 53 countries. He was heard as far afield as the Wild Coast, Transkei, on Capital Radio 604 based there.\nIn a deal promoted by Don Kelley, the Wolfman was paid handsomely to join WNBC in New York in August 1973, the same month that \"American Graffiti\" premiered, and the station did a huge advertising campaign in local newspapers predicting the Wolfman would propel their ratings over those of their main competitor, WABC's Cousin Brucie (Bruce Morrow). The advertisements proclaimed, \"Cousin Brucie's Days Are Numbered / Wolfman Jack Is on the Prowl\", and thousands of small, tombstone-shaped paperweights were distributed that said, \"Cousin Brucie is going to be buried by Wolfman Jack\".\nAfter less than a year, WNBC hired Cousin Brucie, and Wolfman Jack went back to California to concentrate on his syndicated radio show, which was carried on KRLA-Pasadena (Los Angeles) from 1984 to 1987. He moved to Belvidere, North Carolina, in 1989, to be closer to his extended family. In the 1980s, he did a brief stint at XEROK 80, another border-blaster station that was leased by Dallas investors Robert Hanna, Grady Sanders, and John Ryman. He also hosted a TV show at Little Darlin's Rock n' Roll Palace, which was eventually renamed Wolfman Jack's Rock'n'Roll Palace. Ryman then moved Smith to Scott Ginsburg-owned Y95 in Dallas, Texas.\nRecordings of Wolfman Jack's old shows were reintroduced to syndication a decade after his death and remain available to local stations, through Talent Farm as of mid-2020. In 2024, as part of an oldies format marking its 85th anniversary, XEPRS began to carry the remastered recordings.\nFilm, television, and music career.\nIn his early days, Wolfman Jack made sporadic public appearances, usually as a master of ceremonies for rock bands at Los Angeles clubs. At each appearance, he looked a little different because he had not decided what the Wolfman should look like. Early pictures show him with a goatee, but sometimes he combed his straight hair forward and added dark makeup to look somewhat \"ethnic.\" Other times he had a big afro wig and large sunglasses. The ambiguity of his race contributed to the controversy of his program. His audience finally got a good look at him when he appeared in the 1969 film \"A Session with the Committee\", a montage of skits by the comedy troupe The Committee.\nWolfman Jack started his recording career in Minneapolis while working at KUXL Radio in 1965 with George Garrett, who helped record the album \"Boogie with the Wolfman\" by Wolfman Jack and the Wolfpack on the Bread Label. He was also responsible for engineering, producing, and assembling the band. Wolfman Jack also released \"Wolfman Jack\" (1972) and \"Through the Ages\" (1973) on the Wooden Nickel label.\nIn 1973, Wolfman Jack appeared as himself in George Lucas's second feature film \"American Graffiti\". Lucas gave him a fraction of a \"point\", the division of the profits from a film, and the extreme financial success of \"American Graffiti\" provided him with a regular income for life. He also appeared in the film's 1979 sequel \"More American Graffiti\", though only through voice-overs. In 1978, he appeared as Bob \"The Jackal\" Smith in a made-for-TV movie \"Deadman's Curve\" based on the musical careers of Jan Berry and Dean Torrence of Jan and Dean. Smith appeared in several television shows as Wolfman Jack, including \"The Odd Couple\", \"What's Happening!!\", \"Vega$\", \"Hollywood Squares\", \"Married... with Children\" (his final public performance), \"Emergency!\", \"The New Adventures of Wonder Woman\", and \"Galactica 1980\". He was the regular announcer and occasional host for \"The Midnight Special\" on NBC from 1973 to 1981. He was the host of his variety series \"The Wolfman Jack Show\", which was produced in Canada by CBC Television in 1976 and syndicated to stations in the U.S. In 1984, Wolfman Jack starred as himself on the short-lived ABC animated series \"Wolf Rock TV\". He also voiced the chief of the Rama Lama tribe on the TV special \"Garfield in Paradise\" in 1986.\nWolfman Jack's characteristic voice is imitated by disc jockey Ken Griffin on Sugarloaf's 1974 hit single \"Don't Call Us, We'll Call You\" and he is mentioned on the Grateful Dead song \"Ramble On Rose\". He furnished his voice in The Guess Who's top-10 hit single \"Clap for the Wolfman\". In 1976, he furnished his voice on \"Did You Boogie (With Your Baby)\" by Flash Cadillac &amp; the Continental Kids. Wolfman Jack was regularly parodied on \"The Hilarious House of Frightenstein\" as \"The Wolfman,\" an actual werewolf disc jockey with a look inspired by the original \"The Wolf Man\" movies. A few years earlier, Todd Rundgren recorded the tribute \"Wolfman Jack\" on the album \"Something/Anything?\"; the single version of the track includes a shouted talk-over introduction by the Wolfman, but on the album version, Rundgren performs that part himself. Canadian band The Stampeders also released a cover of \"Hit the Road Jack\" in 1975 featuring Wolfman Jack. From 1975 to 1980, Wolfman Jack hosted Halloween Haunt at Knott's Berry Farm, which transforms itself into Knott's Scary Farm each year for Halloween. It was the most successful special event of any theme park in the country, and often sold out.\nIn 2012, the estate of Wolfman Jack released a hip-hop single featuring Wolfman Jack clips as the vocals. In 2016, clips from the Wolfman Jack Radio Program were used in the Rob Zombie film \"31\".\nRadio Caroline.\nWhen the one surviving ship in what had originally been a pirate radio network of Radio Caroline North and Radio Caroline South sank in 1980, a search began to find a replacement. Because of new laws passed in the UK in 1967 (Marine, &amp;c., Broadcasting (Offences) Act 1967), the sales operation needed to be situated outside of the UK. For a time, Don Kelley, Wolfman Jack's business partner and personal manager, acted as the West Coast agent for the planned new Radio Caroline, but the deal eventually fell apart.\nAs a part of this process, Wolfman Jack was set to deliver the morning shows on the new station. To that end, he recorded a number of programs that never aired, because the station did not come on air according to schedule. (It eventually returned in 1983 from a new ship, which remained at sea until 1990.) Today, those tapes are traded among collectors of his work.\nDeath.\nOn July 1, 1995, Smith died from a heart attack at his house in Belvidere, North Carolina, shortly after finishing a weekly broadcast. He was 57 years old. He is buried at a family cemetery in Belvidere.\nTrivia.\n\"Clap for the Wolfman\" is a song written by\u00a0Burton Cummings,\u00a0Bill Wallace, and\u00a0Kurt Winter\u00a0performed by their band,\u00a0the Guess Who. The song appeared on their 1974 album,\u00a0Road Food. The song was ranked #84 on\u00a0Billboard\u00a0magazine's Top\u00a0Hot 100\u00a0songs of\u00a01974.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Osborne (February 6, 1900 \u2013 March 12, 1968) was an American writer of comics, radio shows and animated films, remembered for his contributions to the creation and refinement, during the 1930s, of Walt Disney cartoon characters.\nBiography.\nTed Osborne was born in Oklahoma. He spent 1931\u20131940 at the Walt Disney Studio as a story writer and also wrote for several of the Disney comic strips.\nOsborne, a writer for Los Angeles radio station KHJ, was hired by Disney in October 1931 to develop a Mickey Mouse radio show. That project never materialized, and Osborne moved to the studio's Story Department.\nIn 1933, Osborne moved from Story to the comic strip department, to work with artist Floyd Gottfredson on the popular \"Mickey Mouse\" comic strip. Gottfredson drew the strip and wrote the plots; Osborne broke the plots down into strips and wrote the dialogue.\nOsborne's first Sunday \"Mickey Mouse\" strip was published on January 29, 1933, starting the story \"Lair of Wolf Barker.\" He took over the daily strip as of February 11, with the story \"Pluto and the Dogcatcher\". Osborne scripted many memorable \"Mickey\" stories from 1933 to 1937 which were later adapted into the popular Big Little Books of the 1930s and 1940s, including \"The Mail Pilot\", \"Editor-in-Grief\", \"Mickey Mouse Joins the Foreign Legion\", \"The Seven Ghosts\", \"Island in the Sky\" and \"Monarch of Medioka\".\nIn April 1933, Earl Duvall, who had been writing and drawing the \"Silly Symphony\" Sunday comic strip for Disney, abruptly left the company, leaving the strip without a writer. Osborne stepped in and continued the strip, working with artist Al Taliaferro. The pair wrote a number of adaptations of \"Silly Symphony\" animated shorts, including 1934's \"The Wise Little Hen\" and 1936's \"Three Little Wolves\".\nIn 1936, Taliaferro was allowed to use \"Silly Symphony\" as a tryout for a solo comic strip featuring Donald Duck, with Osborne as writer. The series ran for more than a year, from August 30, 1936 to December 5, 1937. In October 1937, Osborne and Taliaferro introduced Donald's triplet nephews, Huey, Dewey and Louie, for a six-week story. The irrepressible youngsters made such a hit in the comics page that they were introduced in a 1938 cartoon short, \"Donald's Nephews\", and became a crucial part of Donald's supporting cast.\nTaliaferro was given the green light to create a solo \"Donald Duck\" comic strip in 1938, but by that point, Osborne had left the comic strip department. In late 1937, Osborne was moved back to the Story Department to work on \"Bambi\", a feature film project that was ultimately released in 1942. His last \"Silly Symphony\" strip ran on Sunday, December 5, 1937; his last \"Mickey Mouse\" daily was published on February 5, 1938; and his last \"Mickey\" Sunday ran on March 11, 1938.\nHe was succeeded by writer Merrill De Maris on both \"Mickey Mouse\" and \"Silly Symphony\". When his \"Bambi\" team disbanded in 1940, Gottfredson chose to keep De Maris as his permanent writer, and Osborne left the Disney studio.\nAfter leaving the studio, Osborne managed a photographic studio in Hollywood. He died in San Carlos, California on March 12, 1968.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Originally only on the AM band, XERF is a Mexican Class A clear-channel station transmitting with of power. Now branded as \"La Poderosa\", XHRF-FM and XERF-AM simulcast their programming and are owned by the Instituto Mexicano de la Radio (IMER), a Mexican public broadcaster.\nIn earlier times, XERF was operated under the laws of Mexico by Ram\u00f3n D. B\u00f3squez and Arturo Gonz\u00e1lez, transmitting as a border blaster, featuring famed disc jockey Wolfman Jack. XERF received its concession on 26, 1947, and commenced operations, using the old facilities of John R. Brinkley's XERA, which ceased broadcasting in . XERF was not a continuation of XERA.\nCross-national operation (1949\u20131986).\nThe facilities of the old border blaster XERA, which had been created by John R. Brinkley, were confiscated by the Mexican government in , and Villa Acu\u00f1a did not have another high-power station until 22, 1947, when the Compa\u00f1\u00eda Radiodifusora de Coahuila, S.A., headed by Ram\u00f3n D. B\u00f3squez and Arturo Gonz\u00e1lez, signed XERF-AM on the air on 1570 kHz. The station used XERA's old transmission site, with a power of (later increased to ); its first day of broadcasting included a formal opening featuring programs from the chambers of commerce of both Villa Acu\u00f1a and Del Rio, Texas and the presence of the Bishop of Saltillo. For many years, the station made money by selling its time after nightfall to American evangelists who broadcast in English to the United States.\nThe border blaster.\nPrior to , XERF retained the Wilson and Howard Radio Advertising Agency to handle its United States ad sales. In that year, B\u00f3squez and Gonz\u00e1lez formed a Texas corporation called Inter-American Radio Advertising, Inc. which was located on Pecan Street in Del Rio, Texas. While XERF's concession remained with Compa\u00f1\u00eda Radiodifusora de Coahuila, the actual control of the airtime and the management of the facilities in Ciudad Acu\u00f1a were under the control of Inter-American Radio Advertising.\nThe Texas company purchased a RCA transmitter to broadcast an omni-directional clear channel signal on AM 1570, which originated some distance from the old XERA facilities within three new prefabricated concrete buildings with flat roofs. The sales brochure for XERF offered this explanation about the operation of the station (emphasis and wording shown as in the original text):\nThere is, of course, one BIG difference between U.S. and Mexican Stations, and that is a matter of POWER; American Stations are limited a maximum ... a limitation that does not exist under Mexican regulation. X.E.R.F. for example, is licensed to operate on power, and the Department of Communication and Public Works of the Mexican Government has authorized a power increase to . Such power could result in serious interference if wave lengths were not strictly maintained, but the equipment with which X.E.R.F., operates assures its signal to stay \"right on the beam.\" This is something constantly checked by FCC monitor stations, a degree of regulation by the U.S. Government alike that is imposed upon U.S. Stations. Operating on a clear channel, X.E.R.F. is heard nightly in all parts of the fifty States in the United States, Canada and Latin-America.\nAlthough reference was made to a power increase, the station only had an RCA transmitter.\nPaul Kallinger.\nThe booming bass voice of Paul Kallinger was used to sell many of the products on XERF. At night, his recorded spots between the different sponsored shows served as a jingle break. Kallinger remained on the Texas side of the border and recorded his spots at a studio in Del Rio, because he did not want to become embroiled with the lawlessness that swirled around the XERF studio and transmitter on the other side of the border. In between the different religious programs, Kallinger would tell XERF listeners in various versions that:\nIt\u2019s always good to know that we have some fine people out there listening to the most powerful commercial voice in the world ... From alongside the beautiful Rio Grande, this is XERF, Ciudad Acu\u00f1a, Coahuila, Mexico. Our mailing address is Del Rio, Texas. This is Paul Kallinger.\nAs Mexican law required stations to identify in Spanish, the portion identifying the station's call letters and the station's location in Mexico, was then repeated in that language.\nKallinger, along with fellow XERF alumni Bill Mack, were inducted into the Texas Country Music Disc Jockey Hall of Fame in in recognition of their influence on the development of country music.\nWolfman Jack (1962\u20131964).\nWith the birth of rock and roll and its promotion by disc jockeys such as Alan Freed, a new interest was taken in the unrestricted superpower airwaves that were available in Mexico. Alan Freed had originally called himself the \"Moondog\" after hearing the name used by an experimental street musician in New York City. Freed not only adopted the name but used the recording of a howl to give his early broadcasts a unique character since he was featuring African-American music that was getting a great reception from America's White teenagers.\nOne of Freed's fans was Bob Smith, a disc jockey who also adopted the \"Moondog\" theme by calling himself Wolfman Jack and adding his own sound effects. Smith took his act to Inter-American Radio Advertising, who sent him to the studio and transmitter site of XERF. It was here that Wolfman Jack invented his own style of border blasting by turning the airwaves into one long infomercial featuring music and off-the-wall products.\nWolfman Jack gained a huge audience which brought in enough money to not only pay the bills, but to cause bandits and corrupt officials to also take enough interest in taking over his promotions for themselves. As a result, Smith began to pay his own security force to protect him, because although he lived in Del Rio, Texas, because of the Brinkley Act he had to actually broadcast from the station itself in Ciudad Acu\u00f1a in Mexico.\nLawlessness and death.\nIn 1963, XERF returned to the headlines when armed men seized the station. Mexican authorities intervened, stationing federal troops to guard the station. In testimony, employees said they were chased, and that one armed man threatened Kallinger with a .45 pistol. After a legal dispute, a judge found in favor of Sa\u00fal Montes, the station's administrator, who put the station back on the air. In 1964, a gun battle at the station left a 50-year-old man dead; his body was found on an adjoining ranch. Station personnel broadcast panicked pleas for help, prompting local residents to notify the authorities.\nAfter the second gun battle, Bob Smith decided to leave for XERB, a border blaster in Tijuana and listenable in Los Angeles, California. It was this station that George Lucas featured in the movie \"American Graffiti\".\nMeanwhile, XERF reverted to selling time according to the old format devised by Dr. Brinkley. It featured paid programming, most of it from American fringe evangelists, right-wing political groups and Black Nationalist messages from the Nation of Islam. In , a pastor sued the station for removing him from its air, alleging that the contract he had signed was for the duration of its broadcast concession. In the early , the station faced another lawsuit over contracts for airtime on XERF.\nIn early , station employees who had been seeking back wages for 13 years, since the gunfight, won a victory in Mexican court, and Montes was appointed the sole administrator of XERF.\nWith the advent of FM stereo radio broadcasting, interest in the static-prone mono AM signals of XERF began to wane and its signal was switched from the RCA transmitter, which was never paid for and which consistently kept breaking down, to a new transmitter. Its program schedule consisted of primarily religious shows, and it did not broadcast during the day.\nBrief rebirth in the.\nIn , Bob Smith (Wolfman Jack) ran into a radio engineer friend named Mike Venditti, and he told Venditti that no one had been able to get XERF back on full power with its old RCA transmitter, because RCA did not have any manuals relating to the equipment. Venditti then approached Gonz\u00e1lez with a business proposition.\nLove 16.\nIn exchange for restoring the main RCA transmitter to active duty, Venditti asked Gonz\u00e1lez to lease him the daytime hours from () to (UTC\u221206:00). Because the station was only operating on a fraction of power from the transmitter, XERF was not on the air during the day. At night, XERF reverted to its sponsored format of mainly American religious programs.\nVenditti succeeded in getting the old transmitter to work, and at first, his new station \"Love 16\" (a name taken from the 1570 AM frequency) broadcast an English language format composed of a mixture of soft rock, oldies, middle-of-the-road, country, and Big Band music, along with hourly ABC News newscasts. This format did not sell and soon \"Love 16\" was programming a modern Christian music format. That did not work either.\nMichael Venditti was a member of The Word Outreach Center, a Non-Denominational Church in Del Rio during this time. The church was pastored by Michael Kyle, a native of Del Rio and longtime broadcaster himself, having worked in both local radio stations and with Paul Kallinger. Michael Kyle worked an air shift at the station in Mexico when the format went to all music.\nBefore Venditti pulled the plug on Love 16, it attracted a lot of publicity in the Texas press concerning the rebirth of XERF as a real border blaster.\nTexas Night Train.\nAnother group from the Dallas and Fort Worth area then replaced Bill Mack with a nightly taped program called the \"Texas Night Train\". Because the marathon shows which featured every type of popular music and comedy were taped, there was no problem with a lack of live landline connections. Weekend editions were also heard on some U.S. radio stations in Texas, including KXOL, an AM station in Fort Worth.\nThe show took telephone requests which were then mixed into the following-night program tape. Its big feature was the voice of the DJ, who was identified as the \"Night Hawk\", but who some mistook as a voice clone of Wolfman Jack. He was heralded over the sound effects of a massive steam train which gave the impression the \"Texas Night Train\" was chugging its way across Texas.\nWonderful Radio London.\nAnother group that was also based in North Texas who were aware of the Bill Mack venture on XERF and the replacement of his time slot by the \"Texas Night Train\" were the owners of a company attempting to revive the British offshore station Wonderful Radio London. Headed by Ben Toney, who had been the original program manager for \"Big L\" in the , the new company also had links to Don Pierson who had founded the station in . Ben Toney and his business associate went to Del Rio and met with attorney Arturo Gonz\u00e1lez in his law office, which he shared with Inter-American Radio Advertising, Inc.\nArturo Gonz\u00e1lez was of Mexican heritage and a U.S. citizen. He held an exclusive contractual arrangement with XERF's silent concession holders across the Rio Grande in Mexico. Arturo Gonz\u00e1lez was able to enforce his own contract with the concessionaire because his Inter-American Radio Advertising, Inc., held the purse strings to all of the money paid by American advertisers for airtime on XERF.\nBuilt into the costs of operation were not only the expenses incurred from the electrical bills and basic engineering help, but from payments for the physical security of the station as well as the attorney's own profit margin. Little, if anything, was ever spent on studio, transmitter or tower equipment.\nAfter concluding the arrangement with Arturo Gonz\u00e1lez in Del Rio, Ben Toney and his associate then drove across the Rio Grande and on to the dirt roads and through the shacks that led to the small antiquated studio and barn that housed the facilities of radio station XERF. It appeared that, with the new interest being shown in the station from Texas, it would be possible to restore the signal of the station to a dependable high-power strength using the old RCA transmitter.\nBeginning on 13, 1984, the \"Wonderful Radio London Top 40 Show\" was heard nightly via taped programs which were recorded in England and flown to Texas. In British music was once again \"invading\" the US charts in a major way, just as it had in the . However, the U.S. charts were about 12 months behind the British music charts, and so \"Wonderful Radio London\" positioned itself as playing \"tomorrow\u2019s hits today\". To accommodate the new schedule, the \"Texas Night Train\" was pushed back to allow the \"Big L\" show to serve as its lead-in beginning at midnight Texas time. Omnibus weekend editions of the \"Big L\" program were also heard on several US radio stations, including KXOL in Fort Worth.\nThe first of the daily \"Wonderful Radio London\" shows that were broadcast by XERF was introduced by the voice of John Lennon who was asked in what he thought about American commercial radio. On the second night, which was the anniversary of the close-down of the original \"Wonderful Radio London\" on 14, 1967, airchecks were played beginning with the last Breakfast Show that had been broadcast. The program for 14, 1984 began with a record dedicated to Ben Toney in , who then cut in on the program to thank the DJ that he had personally hired 30 years earlier. This dedication was followed by the voices of Mick Jagger, Ringo Starr and many others all bidding the station farewell. The theme of the show was The Beatles\u2019 \"You say goodbye and we say hello\" announcing the new programming that would begin the following night on 15, 1984.\nConstant transmitter problems.\nNo sooner had the \"Wonderful Radio London Top 40 Show\" started when the \"Texas Night Train\" folded. Its demise was due to the same problem that Bill Mack had encountered. The \"Texas Night Train\" often disappeared into the static of the AM band when the XERF transmitter power dropped off. Advertisers would not buy time, and with mounting debts, the \"Texas Night Train\" came to the end of its line. Linking the owners of the \"Texas Night Train\" and \"Wonderful Radio London\" programs was KXOL in Fort Worth where both shows were also aired on weekends. KXOL was in the process of being sold, and Harold Glen Martin, who later returned to work at KXOL, was at that time the only live on-air personality at XERF. Using a \"hillbilly\" accent under the name of \"Billy Purl\", he presented a live country music program to fill the dead air on XERF. Martin claims the honor of being the last live voice heard on XERF. Billy Purl's gold lam\u00e9 XERF jacket is part of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's border radio collection in Cleveland, Ohio.\nFinal proposition.\nTo mark the exact date of its original start-up, \"Wonderful Radio London International\" (WRLI) was planning its own return as a full-time radio station broadcasting from off the coast of England beginning in 1984. (This was during the period in which both Radio Caroline and Laser 558 were broadcasting successfully from ships off the British coast, though not without harassment from the authorities.) After the demise of \"The Texas Night Train\" marathon program, the WRLI team approached attorney Arturo Gonz\u00e1lez in Del Rio with a new proposal. Since XERF reception reports had been received from Europe when the power was maintained at , it was proposed that \"Wonderful Radio London\" would take over the entirety of the hours after midnight Central Time. This would correspond to (UTC). Under the joint call sign of \"Wonderful Radio London via XERF\" and operating as a full-service station at full power, \"Big L\" would be able to attract both the additional funding and advertising necessary to also make the new offshore project into a commercial success.\nHow commercial XERF faded away.\nHowever, time had run out for the superpower XERF when attorney Arturo Gonz\u00e1lez was forced to retire. His own age and the additional questionable legalities, among other things, of brokering a contract that would involve yet another country (the UK), would become more of a headache than he wanted at his time of life. Without his Texas sales connection, the silent owners of the ancient transmitter facilities also knew that the days of XERF were finally over.\nWhen Arturo Gonz\u00e1lez was forced out of the picture due to corruption and alleged fraudulent issues, the Mexicans were left with out-of-date broadcasting facilities and a market that wanted both FM stereo and MTV on cable television. By this time the preachers had also drifted to cable outlets such as Jim Bakker\u2019s PTL and Pat Robertson\u2019s CBN cable television networks.\nAdditionally, regulatory changes on both sides of the border presented a grim panorama. On the American side, a new international radio agreement would diminish the coverage area of Mexican clear-channel stations by allowing American stations to set up shop on those frequencies; meanwhile, Mexico proposed changes to its broadcast law that would allow for operators to own their stations for 10 years, at which time the government would have the right to purchase a station for the depreciated value of its assets.\nXERF under IMER.\nHowever, one Mexican group was highly interested in taking control of XERF for itself. In , the federal government created the Instituto Mexicano de la Radio (IMER, ), which initially owned all of the radio stations which the government had come into owning through other agencies. Given XERF's geographic location, transmitter power, and status on a clear channel, the Mexican government considered XERF of strategic importance to acquire.\nOn 22, 1986, IMER purchased the assets of Compa\u00f1\u00eda Radiodifusora de Coahuila, S.A. and immediately took over operations of XERF. Five days later, in a special shareholders' meeting, Compa\u00f1\u00eda Radiodifusora de Coahuila voted to dissolve itself. The concession was formally transferred to IMER on 20, 1987. However, once IMER acquired XERF, it was left with the old, broken transmitter, for which there were no parts, and a second, transmitter, which was also having problems, and XERF operated with only .\nIn , IMER began a modernization project nationwide. Special attention was paid to XERF, where IMER launched \"Proyecto Ciudad Acu\u00f1a\" to improve the station's technical facilities and strengthen its vision for XERF. With the acquisition of a new transmitter, XERF raised its power to in 2004. On 16, 2005, President Vicente Fox formally dedicated XERF's new facilities.\nThe goal of XERF under IMER is to provide a broadcast service that links migrating Mexicans to their original communities. The station's programming consists of news/talk programs and Mexican popular music.\nAM\u2014FM migration.\nAs part of the Mexican government plan to move as many AM stations as possible to the FM band, XHRF-FM 103.9 MHz signed on , 2012. The station, however, could not turn off its AM transmitter because doing so would leave a total of 404 people in 37 localities without any radio service whatsoever, resulting in the declaration of a continuity obligation that remains until some other radio service is provided to those 404 people.\nHD Radio broadcast and programming.\nXHRF began broadcasts in HD Radio on October 28, 2012. The HD2 stream relays XHOF-FM \"Reactor\", while HD3 features XHIMER-FM \"Opus\", both IMER stations in Mexico City.\nFurther reading.\nNews articles.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBooks.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

They are a family clan of organized criminals who constantly try to rob Scrooge McDuck. Their introduction and first appearance was in \"Terror of the Beagle Boys\" (\"Walt Disney's Comics and Stories\" No. 134, November 1951), although in this story they only appear in the last frame and have no lines. They appear again in the next issue in a similar fashion, in \"The Big Bin on Killmotor Hill\" (\"Walt Disney's Comics and Stories\" No. 135, December 1951). Their next appearance, \"Only a Poor Old Man\" (\"Uncle Scrooge\" No. 1, March 1952), gave them a substantial speaking role and developed them as a collective character.\nThe Beagle Boys in comics.\nBarks/Rosa universe.\nThe Beagle Boys were originally created by Carl Barks and made their first appearance in the 10-page story \"The Terror of the Beagle Boys\" (WDC #134) that was first published in November 1951. Although the Beagle Boys are only shown very briefly on the last page of this story, it is implied that Scrooge has known about them for a long time. The Beagle Boys are usually depicted as a gang of about three to ten members or more depending on the story, who are identical in appearance and personality. They wear black bandit masks to hide their identities and on their turtleneck sweaters, most often being orange or red, they have their prison number signs. The Beagle Boys are often characterized to be very crude, boastful, aggravating, greedy, and self-centered \u2013 among themselves, however, they are very loyal and have a strong connection of sibling camaraderie. Although, on some occasions, they have shown irritation toward each other, often relating to someone making a mistake or saying something that does not fit in with the consensus, like one Beagle Boy's (176\u2013167) overly fondness of prunes; a weakness that proves to be the Beagle Boys' downfall in some stories. 176-167's love for prunes makes him the only Beagle Boy with a unique characteristic.\nThe first story to feature the Beagle Boys in a major role is \"Only a Poor Old Man\" (\"Four Color Comics\" No. 386, March 1952, retroactively regarded as \"Uncle Scrooge\" No. 1), which serves as a template for virtually all future Beagle Boys appearances, and establishes them as a serious threat to Scrooge's fortune. In the same story, they are called \"the most awful gang of crooks in the country\" by Donald Duck. This most often manifests with them cleverly coming up with various or elaborate schemes to try to break into and steal from Scrooge McDuck's well-secured Money Bin. On occasion they are even shown to have highly intellectual capacities, as they are able to earn academic degrees in various fields. Among individual Beagle Boys, some of these degrees include: cranial encephalography, psychology, chemistry, metallurgy, and electropyrotechnology. These were often seen by the government as attempts at rehabilitation, but in reality, it was a charade by the Beagle Boys to use their newly acquired skills for robberies. They are also experts at trickery, including disguises, and animal training; like using cormorants as aerial bombers, as well as having a large arsenal of various weapons, explosives, or machines. When needed, they have been shown to be able to use force or threats to get what they want. With all things considered, however, the Beagle Boys are often attributed not to be as clever as they think they are, often gullible to tricks and offensives themselves. Also, most of their appearances ends with them getting arrested. They are usually imprisoned in Duckburg prisons or Sing Sing, but they have also been jailed in other prisons as well. The Beagle Boys are however proud of their criminal background; never willing to live their lives in accordance to the law.\nThe Beagle Boys' main goal for stealing Scrooge McDuck's money is so they can create a paradisiacal life of luxury for themselves. On few occasions when they have managed to steal the money, they are shown to spend it all very wastefully and in excess; like buying extravagant and ostentatious mansions or living on a paradise island near Hawaii. They have also shown proneness for taking over the world when being presented with such an opportunity, like in Carl Barks' story \"The Mysterious Stone Ray\" (\"Uncle Scrooge\" No. 8, 1954).\nThe Beagle Boys are most often shown without an established leader, instead acting as a very coherent and homogeneous unit, and only giving orders between each other interchangeably when needed. However, sometimes the Beagle Boys are led by their grandfather, Blackheart Beagle, who has the prison number 186\u2013802. The Blackheart character originates from two characters created by Carl Barks: Blackheart Beagle, a riverboat pirate from \"The Fantastic River Race\" (\"Uncle Scrooge goes to Disneyland\" #1, 1957), and Grandpa Beagle, who appeared in \"The Money Well\" (\"Uncle Scrooge\" #21, 1958). It was Don Rosa who later combined the character into one in chapters 10 and 11 of \"The Life and Times of Scrooge McDuck\". Also, according to Rosa, Blackheart Beagle semi-retired in 1947, following a failed attempt at robbing Scrooge's Money Bin. In \"The Life and Times of Scrooge McDuck\", Scrooge first met The Beagle Boys in his Mississippi riverboat days, circa 1880. Those Beagle Boys included Blackheart Beagle and his three sons.\nScrooge first met the modern third-generation Beagle Boys during Christmas 1947, which was when he first met his three grandnephews, along with his nephew Donald Duck for the second time. Since then, the Beagle Boys have been a constant threat to Scrooge's Money Bin.\nThe third generation of the Beagle Boys, like their fathers, were never given any personal names by Carl Barks but was instead referred to by their prison numbers, which starts with \"176-\" and ends on a permutation of the numbers 1, 6, and 7, which allows six different combinations. This tradition was first established in Barks' \"The Menehune Mystery\" (Uncle Scrooge No. 4, December 1953), while the Beagle Boys in previous stories, and some of them in \"The Menehune Mystery\", instead had their prison numbers as \"176-\" followed by random digits (except in their first story, where they have no prison numbers). However, in a few of his later stories, Barks did not continue this tradition and used random numbers again instead. But subsequent writers and artists by default still mostly uses the 1, 6, and 7 combinations for the Beagle Boys in the modern comic books. The Beagle Boys also have their prison numbers tattooed on their chests. According to Don Rosa's \"The Beagle Boys vs. The Money Bin\" (2001), the Beagle Boys have been known by their prison numbers since their childhood, and they do not even know their real names themselves. Their parents do know their real names, but demand a bribe from their sons to let them know. Also according to that story, Blackheart Beagle does not remember his sons' names.\nCarl Barks used to include the words \"Beagle Boys, Inc.\" on their shirts under their numbers, which was later deleted in reprints. It can either be assumed that this was a reference to Murder, Inc., a name for organized crime groups in the 1930s and 40s; or that they are a criminal organization very similar to a real business, but neither is certain. In one comic, the Beagle Boys have a worldwide organization known as Beagles International, in which the Beagles have spies in different countries around the world.\nIn most of Carl Barks stories, the number of Beagle Boys was not exact but instead they were depicted as being ambiguously numerous, with their number of members varying from story to story. However, if one would count all of the different combinations of the Beagle Boys' prison numbers that was used in the comic books by Carl Barks, the Beagle Boys would seem to consist of at least 36 members. In \"The Menehune Mystery\", Scrooge mentions thirty Beagle Boys. Don Rosa, however, constantly uses seven Beagle Boys in his stories, but instead of using a random number Rosa always hides one prison numbers behind something to avoid two Beagle Boys having the same number.\nThe Beagle Boys usually operate on their own, but collaborated with Magica De Spell in the 1963 Barks story \"Isle of the Golden Geese\", and again in the 1997 Don Rosa story \"A Little Something Special\" where they also teamed up with Flintheart Glomgold. In \"The Status Seeker\" (\"Uncle Scrooge\" No. 41, 1963) by Carl Barks, they are shown to be part of a labor union called the \"Burglars, Thugs, and Pirates Union\", at Local No. 61\u20442.\nOther comics.\nFrom 1964 to 1979 the Beagle Boys had their own comic book title, \"The Beagle Boys\", published by Gold Key Comics, which continued from 1979 to 1980 under the name \"The Beagle Boys Versus Uncle Scrooge\".\nIn all comics, the individual Beagle Boys are referred to by their prison numbers as per Barks's convention. In addition to Barks's and Rosa's claim that the Beagle Boys do not know their names, the Beagle Boys-centric comic \"Being Donald Duck\" (2003) by Olaf Moriarty Solstrand adds that the Beagle Boys do not know their mother's name either, only her number. The Beagle Boys' prison numbers are indicated on the tags seen on the chests of their distinctive orange or red turtleneck sweaters. The original depictions by Barks in American comics most often showed the Beagle Boys with orange sweaters. European comics recolored these same Barks drawings to show Beagle Boys in red sweaters. Subsequent European comic depictions of the Beagle Boys by artists other than Barks also showed them in red sweaters, as did the \"DuckTales\" cartoons.\nIn later years, especially in Europe, they appear in the comics as a trio, alongside cousins and other relatives of various talents as spin-off characters. Most notably are the Beagle Brats, the Beagle Boys' three preteen nephews created by Tony Strobl and Steve Steere in \"That Motherly Feeling\" (\"Walt Disney's Comics and Stories\" No. 299, 1965). They mirror criminal versions of Scrooge's three nephews and have the prison numbers 1, 2, and 3. Another prominent relative is Intellectual-176 (or I-176, for short), the Beagle Boys' cousin who acts as the brains of the Beagle clan. He wears a mortar-board cap and glasses over his black bandit mask and has the prison number \"I-176\". I-176 was created by Pete Alvarado and first appeared in \"The Crown Jewel Job\" (\"The Beagle Boys\" No. 7, 1967).\nThe Beagle Boys generally live in a small tumbledown hide-out in Duckburg; in 1970s American-produced stories, their pet cat Ratty often lived there as well. In the Italian stories, they live in a travel trailer and are sometimes accompanied by their pet dachshund, Ottoperotto, who shares their criminal mindset, but is often overcome with Ottoperotto's constant, voracious appetite.\nSometimes they team up with other villains such as Magica De Spell, Black Pete, Mad Madam Mim, or hire out their services to Flintheart Glomgold, John D. Rockerduck, and Jolly Ollie Eiderduck. During these occasions, they continue to operate out of their own interests rather than their employers'.\nMany other authors use a character purely based on \"The Money Well\" version as the Beagle Boys' grandfather. In particular, Italian authors use a \"Grandpa Beagle\" who differs from Blackheart in being much skinnier and constantly smoking a pipe. Unlike his grandsons, he is highly intelligent and appears as their cunning and capable leader, hatching devious plans. The Italian version of Grandpa Beagle has the word \"GRAZIA\" (which means \"pardon\" in Italian) where his prison number should be. When his stories are translated for the US, \"GRAZIA\" is replaced with \"186\u2013802\", his prison number in Western stories.\nSometimes the Beagle Boys antagonize Super Goof, Mickey Mouse, or some other characters from Walt Disney's comic books.\nOttoperotto.\nOttoperotto \u2013 univerbation of \u2013 is the Beagle Boys' pet dachshund in Italian comic book stories. The joke about him being a dachshund is that in Italy the Beagle Boys are referred to as \"Banda Bassotti\", which means \"Dachshund Gang\". Like his masters, Ottoperotto wears a bandit mask, a shirt, and a cap, marked with the number 64 (the result of the 8\u00d78 multiplication). The Beagle Boys frequently take Ottoperotto along on their robberies, to act as a guard dog and to reach spaces too small for the Beagle Boys themselves. However, the plans are often spoiled by Ottoperotto's constant, voracious appetite. Whenever Ottoperotto smells food, he abandons everything else to get to eat it.\nThe Beagle Boys in animation.\n\"Sport Goofy in Soccermania\".\nThe Beagle Boys made their animated debut in the 1987 television special \"Sport Goofy in Soccermania\", voiced by Will Ryan. Similar to the comic books, the Beagle Boys are depicted as identical in both appearance and behavior, though lacking the prison numbers of their comic counterparts.\n\"DuckTales\".\nOn \"DuckTales\", the Beagle Boys were given names and different personalities and almost all of them speak in New York accents. The usual character combination is Bigtime, Burger, and either Bouncer or Baggy, with Bouncer appearing more often in the first season and Baggy in the second. Their leader is usually Bigtime when Ma Beagle is not present. Sometimes one or two of them were swapped out with Bankjob, Babyface, or Bugle, and a few episodes featured the latter three as the trio of Beagles, with Bankjob filling in for Bigtime as the leader. Other known names are Bomber and Blitzkrieg. The letter B is the first initial of all Beagle Boys' handles except Megabyte, the brains of the bunch.\nThe Beagle Boys have many relatives who count each other as brothers and cousins: apart from Ma Beagle, there are re-imagined versions of the Beagle Brats (sons or nephews), as well as the Beagle Babes (a female counterpart).\nThe Beagle Boys make cameos in the \"Darkwing Duck\" episode \"In Like Blunt\", where they are among the villains bidding on a list of SHUSH's secret agents.\nMa Beagle.\nMa Beagle, based on the real-life Ma Barker and the mystifications around her, was a new character created for \"DuckTales\" as the mother of the seven common Beagle Boys featured on the show, and the clan matriarch. She often smuggles hand grenades, chainsaws, and other tools in baked goods which easily pass prison security to help her sons escape from jail. Even when she is around, the Beagles never succeed because Scrooge McDuck and his nephews always outwit them. However, in most of the episodes she appears in (especially in the first season), she is able to avoid being arrested along with her sons; that way, she will be able to bust them out the next time she appears. In one episode, she pretended to be \"married\" to Scrooge so that she could steal his fortune, but her plans were thwarted by both him and his three nephews. With Ma, family always comes first \u2013 except when it comes to avoiding arrest. She was voiced by actress June Foray, who also voiced Magica De Spell. Character actress Margo Martindale voices Ma in the 2017 \"DuckTales\" series.\nMa Beagle first appeared in the episode \"Robot Robbers\", and since then she has become a recurring character. She appeared more frequently in the second season than in the first, however.\n1987 Series Beagles.\nThere were many Beagle Boys on the 1987 original series, but the most common seven consisted of:\nOther Beagle Boys consisted of:\n2017 Series Beagles.\nIn the 2017 reboot series, the Beagle Boys are divided into several smaller gangs with Ma Beagle serving as the leader of all of them, as revealed in the episode \"The Beagle Birthday Massacre!\", and are all voiced by Eric Bauza. In the season two episode, \"The Golden Armory of Cornelius Coot!\", it is revealed the feud between them and Scrooge McDuck originated from a battle between Duckburg's founder Cornelius Coot and the Beagles of that time. The latter attempted to attack a fort the former was holding, only to be tricked into retreating when Coot used popcorn makers to make the Beagles think he was everywhere at once. The fort would go on to become Fort Duckburg and strike up the feud for control of the land it was on. In a flashback depicted in the episode \"The Life and Crimes of Scrooge McDuck!\", the Beagle Boys under Pappy Beagle temporarily took control of Fort Duckburg after stealing its deed, but Scrooge took it back from them, leading to a young Ma Beagle taking control of the gang from her father.\n\"Mickey, Donald, Goofy: The Three Musketeers\".\nThe Beagle Boys appeared as Pete's henchmen in the film \"\". There are only three Beagle Boys in the film, one of them noted for being short (however, unlike Big Time, he was not the leader but more or less the \"idiot\" of the group), with gray skin and black hoods. They decide to depose Princess Minnie so Pete could become king. They were shown to be much more dangerous compared to their original \"DuckTales\" counterparts. These Beagle Boys were collectively voiced by Jeff Bennett and Maurice LaMarche.\nThese versions of the Beagle Boys appear in the video game \"\".\n\"Mickey Mouse\" &amp; \"The Wonderful World of Mickey Mouse\".\nIn the television series \"Mickey Mouse\", the Beagle Boys appear in the episode \"Sock Burglar\" as part of the villains that Minnie interrogates, and in \"Touchdown and Out\" as part of the football team that Pete forms with them and Chernabog to play against Mickey, Donald and Goofy.\nIn the spin-off series \"The Wonderful World of Mickey Mouse\", they appear in the episode \"Keep on Rollin'\" arriving with Pete and Ursula at the roller rink where Mickey and his friends always enjoy, being kicked out by the group of villains from the place, and later having to face them in a roller skating competition to get their meeting place back.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The story was based on the 1954 novel \"D'entre les morts\" (\"From Among the Dead\") by Boileau-Narcejac, with a screenplay by Alec Coppel and Samuel A. Taylor. The film stars James Stewart as a former San Francisco police detective who has retired after an incident in the line of duty caused him to develop an extreme fear of heights, accompanied by vertigo. He is hired as a private investigator to report on the strange behavior of an acquaintance's wife (Kim Novak).\nThe film was shot on location in San Francisco, as well as in Mission San Juan Bautista, Big Basin Redwoods State Park, Cypress Point on 17-Mile Drive, and at Paramount Studios in Hollywood. The film stock of the camera negative was Eastman 25 ASA tungsten-balanced 5248 with processing and prints by Technicolor. It was the first film to use the dolly zoom, an in-camera effect that distorts perspective to create disorientation, to convey Scottie's acrophobia; the technique is often referred to as \"the \"Vertigo\" effect\" in reference to its use in the film. In 1996, the film underwent a major restoration to create a new 70 mm print and DTS soundtrack.\n\"Vertigo\" received mixed reviews on release, but it has since come to be considered Hitchcock's \"magnum opus\" and one of the greatest films of all time. In 1989, it was one of the first 25 films selected by the Library of Congress for preservation in the United States National Film Registry for being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\". The film appears repeatedly in polls of the best films by the American Film Institute, including a 2007 ranking as the ninth-greatest American film ever. Attracting significant scholarly attention, it replaced \"Citizen Kane\" as the greatest film ever made in the 2012 \"Sight &amp; Sound\" Greatest Films of All Time poll, and came in second place in the 2022 edition of the poll.\nPlot.\nAfter a rooftop chase in which a fellow policeman falls to his death, San Francisco detective John \"Scottie\" Ferguson retires due to acrophobia and accompanying vertigo caused by the incident. Midge, his ex-fianc\u00e9e, says that another severe emotional shock may be the only cure. Midge retains feelings for Scottie, but he is not receptive to her intimations.\nGavin Elster, an acquaintance from college, asks Scottie to follow his wife, Madeleine, claiming that she has been behaving strangely. Scottie follows Madeleine to the grave of Carlotta Valdes (1831\u20131857) at the Mission San Francisco de As\u00eds and to the Legion of Honor art museum, where she gazes at the \"Portrait of Carlotta\".\nA local historian explains that Carlotta Valdes committed suicide: she had been the mistress of a wealthy married man and borne his child, and the otherwise childless man kept the child and cast Carlotta aside. Carlotta, who Gavin fears is possessing Madeleine, was Madeleine's great-grandmother. However, Madeleine does not know this or remember the places she has visited while ostensibly possessed. Scottie trails her to Fort Point and rescues her after she jumps into San Francisco Bay.\nThe next day, Madeleine stops to deliver a letter of gratitude to Scottie, and they spend the day together. They travel to Muir Woods and Cypress Point on 17-Mile Drive, where they embrace. The next day, Madeleine recounts a nightmare, and Scottie identifies its setting as Mission San Juan Bautista, Carlotta's childhood home. He drives her there, and they express their love for each other. Madeleine suddenly runs into the church and up the bell tower, asking Scottie not to follow her. Scottie runs after her, but is halted on the steps by his fear of heights and sees her plunge to her death.\nAn inquest into Madeleine's death declares it a suicide, though the coroner rebukes Scottie for not doing more to save her. Gavin also does not fault Scottie, but Scottie becomes clinically depressed and is sent to a sanatorium in an almost catatonic state. Following his release, he frequents the places that Madeleine visited, often imagining that he sees her. One day, he notices a woman on the street who, although superficially very different, reminds him of Madeleine. He follows her into her apartment, where she identifies herself as Judy Barton, from Salina, Kansas.\nA flashback reveals that Judy was the person Scottie knew as \"Madeleine Elster\"; she had been impersonating Gavin's wife in an elaborate murder scheme. Gavin took advantage of Scottie's fear of heights to substitute his wife's freshly killed body in the apparent \"suicide jump\". Judy writes a note to Scottie confessing her involvement in the plot, but tears it up and decides to continue the charade because she loves him.\nThe two begin seeing each other, but Scottie remains obsessed with \"Madeleine\" and asks Judy to change her clothes and dye her hair to resemble her. After she complies, he notices her wearing the necklace portrayed in Carlotta's painting. Realizing the truth, he drives Judy back to the mission.\nThere, he tells her that he must re-enact the event that led to his madness, and that he now knows that \"Madeleine\" and Judy are the same person, with Judy having been Gavin's mistress before being cast aside just as Carlotta had been. He forces her up the bell tower and makes her admit her deceit. Judy confesses that Gavin paid her to impersonate a \"possessed\" Madeleine and begs Scottie to forgive her. He embraces Judy at the top of the tower, but a shadowy figure\u2014a nun investigating the noise\u2014rises from the tower's staircase, startling her. Judy lunges backward off the tower to her death; Scottie, bereaved once again but cured of his fear of heights, stands on the ledge in shock while the nun rings the mission bell.\nCast.\nAlfred Hitchcock makes his customary cameo appearance walking in front of Gavin Elster's shipyard, carrying a trumpet case.\nThemes and interpretations.\nIn his monograph dedicated to the study of \"Vertigo,\" Charles Barr has stated that the central theme of the film is psychological obsession, concentrating in particular on Scottie as obsessed with the women in his life. Barr notes, \"This story of a man who develops a romantic obsession with the image of an enigmatic woman has commonly been seen, by his colleagues as well as by critics and biographers, as one that engaged Hitchcock in an especially profound way; and it has exerted a comparable fascination on many of its viewers. After first seeing it as a teenager in 1958, Donald Spoto had gone back for 26 more viewings by the time he wrote \"The Art of Alfred Hitchcock\" in 1976. In a 1996 magazine article, Geoffrey O'Brien cites other cases of 'permanent fascination' with \"Vertigo\", and then casually reveals that he himself, starting at age 15, has seen it 'at least thirty times'.\"\nCritics have interpreted \"Vertigo\" variously as \"a tale of male aggression and visual control; as a map of female Oedipal trajectory; as a deconstruction of the male construction of femininity and of masculinity itself; as a stripping bare of the mechanisms of directorial, Hollywood studio and colonial oppression; and as a place where textual meanings play out in an infinite regress of self-reflexivity.\" Critic James F. Maxfield has suggested that \"Vertigo\" can be interpreted as a variation on Ambrose Bierce's 1890 short story \"An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge\", in which the main narrative of the film is actually imagined by Scottie as he dangles from a building at the end of the opening rooftop chase.\nProduction.\nDevelopment.\nThe screenplay of \"Vertigo\" is an adaptation of the 1954 French novel \"D'entre les morts\" (\"From Among the Dead\") by Pierre Boileau and Thomas Narcejac. Hitchcock had attempted to buy the rights to the previous novel by the same authors, \"Celle qui n'\u00e9tait plus\" (\"She Who Was No More\"), but failed, and it was instead adapted by Henri-Georges Clouzot as \"Les Diaboliques\". Although Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut once suggested that \"D'entre les morts\" was specifically written for Hitchcock by Boileau and Narcejac, Narcejac subsequently denied that this was their intention. However, Hitchcock's interest in their work meant that Paramount Pictures commissioned a synopsis of \"D'entre les morts\" in 1954, before it had even been translated into English (it appeared in translation as \"The Living and the Dead\" in 1956).\nIn the book, Judy's involvement in Madeleine's death was not revealed until the denouement; at the scriptwriting stage, Hitchcock suggested revealing the secret two-thirds of the way through the film so that the audience would understand Judy's dilemma. After the first preview, Hitchcock was unsure whether or not to keep the \"letter writing scene\", though he subsequently decided to remove it. Herbert Coleman, \"Vertigo\"'s associate producer and a frequent collaborator with Hitchcock, felt the removal was a mistake; however, Hitchcock said to \"Release it just like that.\" James Stewart, acting as mediator, said to Coleman: \"Herbie, you shouldn't get so upset with Hitch. The picture's not that important.\" Hitchcock's decision was supported by screenwriter Joan Harrison, another member of his circle, who felt that the film had been improved. Coleman reluctantly made the necessary edits. When Paramount head Barney Balaban received news of this, he ordered Hitchcock to \"Put the picture back the way it was,\" ensuring that the scene remained in the final cut.\nWriting.\nThree screenwriters were involved in the writing of \"Vertigo\". Hitchcock originally hired playwright Maxwell Anderson to write a screenplay, but rejected his work, which was titled \"Darkling, I Listen\" (a quotation from John Keats's 1819 poem \"Ode to a Nightingale\"). According to Charles Barr in his monograph dedicated to \"Vertigo\", \"Anderson was the oldest (at 68) [of the three writers involved], the most celebrated for his stage work, and the least committed to cinema, though he had a joint script credit for Hitchcock's preceding film \"The Wrong Man\". He worked on adapting the novel during Hitchcock's absence abroad, and submitted a treatment in September 1956.\"\nA second version, written by Alec Coppel, again left the director dissatisfied. The final script was written by Samuel A. Taylor, who had been recommended to Hitchcock due to his knowledge of San Francisco, from notes by the director. Among Taylor's creations was the character of Midge. Taylor attempted to take sole credit for the screenplay, but Coppel protested to the Screen Writers Guild, which determined that both writers (but not Anderson) were entitled to a credit.\nCasting.\nVera Miles, who was under personal contract to Hitchcock and had appeared both on \"Alfred Hitchcock Presents\" and in \"The Wrong Man\", was originally scheduled to play Madeleine, and modeled for an early version of the portrait of Carlotta. Following delays, including Hitchcock becoming ill with gallbladder problems, Miles became pregnant and had to withdraw from the role. The director declined to postpone shooting, and cast Kim Novak as Miles' replacement.\nFilming.\nInitial on-site principal photography.\n\"Vertigo\" was filmed from September to December 1957. Principal photography began on location in San Francisco in September 1957 under the working title \"From Among the Dead\". The film uses extensive location footage of the San Francisco Bay Area. In the driving scenes shot in San Francisco, the main characters' cars are almost always pictured heading down the city's steeply inclined streets.\nThe scene in which Madeleine falls from the tower was filmed at Mission San Juan Bautista, a Spanish mission in San Juan Bautista, California. Associate producer Herbert Coleman's daughter Judy Lanini suggested the mission to Hitchcock as a filming location. A steeple, added sometime after the mission's original construction and secularization, had been demolished following a fire, so Hitchcock added a bell tower much larger than the one previously at the mission using scale models, matte paintings, and trick photography at Paramount Studios.\nIn October 1996, the restored print of \"Vertigo\" debuted at the Castro Theatre in San Francisco with a live on-stage introduction by Kim Novak. Visiting the San Francisco film locations has accrued modest tourist appeal; such a tour is featured in a subsection of Chris Marker's 1983 documentary montage \"Sans Soleil\".\nSubsequent studio shooting.\nFollowing 16 days of location shooting, the production moved to Paramount's studios in Hollywood for two months of filming. Hitchcock preferred to film in studios as he was able to control the environment. Once sufficient location footage had been obtained, interior sets were designed and constructed in the studio.\nHitchcock popularized the dolly zoom in this film, leading to the technique's sobriquet, amongst several others, \"the \"Vertigo\" effect\". This \"dolly-out/zoom-in\" method involves the camera physically moving away from a subject whilst simultaneously zooming in (a similar effect can be achieved in reverse), so that the subject retains its size in the frame, but the background's perspective changes. Hitchcock used the effect to look down the tower shaft to emphasise its height and Scottie's disorientation. Following difficulties filming the shot on a full-sized set, a model of the tower shaft was constructed, and the dolly zoom was filmed horizontally. The \"special sequence\" (Scottie's nightmare sequence) was designed by artist John Ferren, who also created the painting of Carlotta.\nThe rotating patterns in the title sequence were created by animator John Whitney using a Kerrison Predictor, a mechanical computer which was used during World War II to aim anti-aircraft cannons at moving targets. This made it possible to produce an animated version of Lissajous curves.\nCostume design.\nHitchcock and costume designer Edith Head used color to heighten emotion. Grey was chosen for Madeleine's suit in an attempt to be psychologically jarring, as it is not usually a blonde's color. In contrast, Novak's character wore a white coat when she visited Scottie's apartment, which Head and Hitchcock considered more natural for a blonde to wear.\nAlternative ending.\nA coda to the film was shot that showed Midge at her apartment, listening to a radio report (voiced by San Francisco TV reporter Dave McElhatton) describing the pursuit of Gavin Elster across Europe. Midge switches the radio off when Scottie enters the room, and they then share a drink and look out of the window in silence. Contrary to reports that this scene was filmed to meet foreign censorship needs, this tag ending had originally been demanded by Geoffrey Shurlock of the U.S. Production Code Administration, who had noted: \"It will, of course, be most important that the indication that Elster will be brought back for trial is sufficiently emphasized.\"\nHitchcock ultimately succeeded in fending off most of Shurlock's demands, including toning down erotic allusions, and had the alternative ending dropped. The footage was discovered in Los Angeles in May 1993, and was added as an alternative ending on LaserDisc, DVD, and Blu-ray releases of the film.\nMusic.\nThe film's score was written by regular Hitchcock collaborator Bernard Herrmann. It was conducted by Muir Mathieson and recorded in Europe because of a musicians' strike in the United States.\nIn a 2004 special issue of the British Film Institute's magazine \"Sight and Sound\", director Martin Scorsese described the qualities of Herrmann's score:\nHitchcock's film is about obsession, which means that it's about circling back to the same moment, again and again... And the music is also built around spirals and circles, fulfillment and despair. Herrmann really understood what Hitchcock was going for \u2014 he wanted to penetrate to the heart of obsession.\nGraphic design.\nGraphic designer Saul Bass used spiral motifs in both the title sequence and the movie poster, emphasizing what the documentary \"Obsessed with Vertigo\" calls the film's \"psychological vortex\". Bass's unconventional framing of actress Audrey Lowell's facial features in the first images of the titles was indebted to Bauhaus photography. According to her 1997 \"Guardian\" interview, Kim Novak wanted to do the opening title sequence but Harry Cohn insisted Hitchcock pay full rate for the single day's shooting and so another face was chosen.\nRelease.\n\"Vertigo\" premiered in San Francisco on May 9, 1958, at the Stage Door Theater (now the August Hall nightclub). While \"Vertigo\" did break even upon its original release, earning $3.2 million in North American distributor rentals against its $2,479,000 cost, it earned significantly less than other Hitchcock productions.\nRestoration and re-release.\nIn October 1983, \"Rear Window\" and \"Vertigo\" were the first two Hitchcock films reissued by Universal Pictures after the studio acquired the rights from the director's estate. These two films \u2013 along with \"The Man Who Knew Too Much\" (1956), \"Rope\" (1948), and \"The Trouble with Harry\" (1955) \u2013 had been kept out of distribution by the director since 1968. Cleaning and restoration were performed on each film when new 35\u00a0mm prints were struck.\nIn 1996, the film was given a lengthy and controversial restoration by Robert A. Harris and James C. Katz and re-released to theaters. The new print featured restored color and newly created audio, using modern sound effects mixed in DTS digital surround sound. In October 1996, the restored \"Vertigo\" premiered at the Castro Theatre in San Francisco, with Kim Novak and Patricia Hitchcock attending. At this screening, the film was exhibited for the first time in DTS and 70mm, a format with a similar frame size to the VistaVision system in which it was originally shot.\nSignificant color correction was necessary because of the fading of original negatives. In some cases a new negative was created from the silver separation masters, but in many instances this was impossible because of differential separation shrinkage, and because the 1958 separations were poorly made. Separations used three individual films: one for each of the primary colors. In the case of \"Vertigo\", these had shrunk in different and erratic proportions, making re-alignment impossible.\nAs a result, significant amounts of computer assisted coloration were necessary. Although the results are not noticeable on viewing the film, some elements were as many as eight generations away from the original negative, in particular the entire \"Judy's Apartment\" sequence. When such large portions of re-creation become necessary, then the danger of artistic license by the restorers becomes an issue, and the restorers received some criticism for their re-creation of colors that allegedly did not honor the director's and cinematographer's intentions. The restoration team argued that they did research on the colors used in the original locations, cars, wardrobe, and skin tones. One breakthrough came when the Ford Motor Company supplied a well-preserved green paint sample for a car used in the film. As the color green has extensive symbolic use in the film, matching a shade of green was important for restoration and provided a reference shade.\nWhen restoring the sound, Harris and Katz wanted to stay as close as possible to the original, and had access to the original music recordings that had been stored in the vaults at Paramount. However, as the project demanded a new 6-channel DTS soundtrack, it was necessary to re-record some sound effects. The soundtrack was remixed at the Alfred Hitchcock Theatre at Universal Studios. Aware that the film had a considerable following, the restoration team knew that they were under particular pressure to restore the film as accurately as possible. To achieve this, they used Hitchcock's original dubbing notes for guidance of how the director wanted the film to sound. Harris and Katz sometimes added extra sound effects to camouflage \"hisses, pops, and bangs\" in the old soundtrack; in particular, they added extra seagull cries and a foghorn to the scene at Cypress Point.\nHome media.\nIn 1996, director Harrison Engle produced the documentary \"Obsessed with Vertigo\". Narrated by Roddy McDowall, the film played on American Movie Classics, and has since been included with DVD versions of \"Vertigo\". Surviving members of the cast and crew participated, along with Martin Scorsese and Patricia Hitchcock. Engle first visited the \"Vertigo\" shooting locations in the summer of 1958, just months after completion of the film.\n\"Vertigo\" was first released on DVD in March 1998. On October 4, 2011, the film was re-issued on DVD by Universal Pictures Home Entertainment as part of the \"Alfred Hitchcock: The Essentials Collection\". Subsequently, the film was released on Blu-ray on September 25, 2012, as part of the \"Alfred Hitchcock: The Masterpiece Collection\". In May 2014, the film was re-released as a stand-alone Blu-ray edition. Some home video releases, such as the 2005 \"Hitchcock Masterpiece Collection\" DVD set, contain the original mono track as an option.\nIn October 2014, a new 4K restoration was presented at the Castro Theatre in San Francisco. This version gives credit to Harris and Katz at the end of the film, and thanks them for providing some previously unknown stereo soundtracks. This version, however, removes some of the \"excessive\" Foley sounds that were added in the 1996 restoration.\nIn September 2020, an Ultra HD Blu-ray was released by Universal Pictures Home Entertainment as a part of the first volume of \"The Alfred Hitchcock Classics Collection\". In September 2021, a stand-alone version was released alongside a SteelBook.\nReception.\nContemporaneous reception.\nInitial critical reception for \"Vertigo\" was mixed. \"Variety\" wrote that the film showed Hitchcock's \"mastery\", but felt the film was \"too long and slow\" for \"what is basically only a psychological murder mystery\". Similarly, Philip K. Scheuer of the \"Los Angeles Times\" admired the scenery, but found the plot took \"too long to unfold\" and felt it \"bogs down in a maze of detail\". Scholar Dan Auiler says that this review \"sounded the tone that most popular critics would take with the film\". However, the \"Los Angeles Examiner\" loved it, admiring the \"excitement, action, romance, glamor and [the] crazy, off-beat love story\". \"The New York Times\" film critic Bosley Crowther also gave \"Vertigo\" qualified praise by stating that \"[the] secret [of the film] is so clever, even though it is devilishly far-fetched.\" Richard L. Coe of \"The Washington Post\" praised the film as a \"wonderful weirdie,\" writing that \"Hitchcock has even more fun than usual with trick angles, floor shots and striking use of color. More than once he gives us critical scenes in long shots establishing how he's going to get away with a couple of story tricks.\" John McCarten of \"The New Yorker\" wrote derisively that Hitchcock had \"never before indulged in such farfetched nonsense.\"\nThe \"New York Post\" review echoed many critics': \"Let's admit it right now. Hitchcock's surfaces are so smooth he thinks he can get away with murder in the logic and realism departments. If you want to tear 'Vertigo' apart, it rips easily. On the other hand, there's no denying that James Stewart's unactorish acting carries a heavy air of reality into the picture, and Kim Novak's somnambulistic behavior, called for by the script, is something she can do to perfection...It's doubtful that 'Vertigo' can take equal rank with the best of the Hitchcock studies\u2014it has too many holes\u2014but it assays high in visual confectionary of place, person, and celluloid wiles.\"\nContemporaneous response in England was summarized by Charles Barr in his monograph on \"Vertigo\": \"In England, the reception was if anything rather less friendly. Of the 28 newspaper and magazine reviews that I have looked at, six are, with reservations, favourable, nine are very mixed, and 13 almost wholly negative. Common to all of these reviews is a lack of sympathy with the basic structure and drive of the picture. Even the friendlier ones single out for praise elements that seem, from today's perspective, to be marginal virtues and incidental pleasures \u2013 the 'vitality' of the supporting performances (Dilys Powell in \"The Sunday Times\"), the slickness with which the car sequences are put together (Isobel Quibley in \"The Spectator\")\".\nIn France, \u00c9ric Rohmer noted in \"Cahiers du Cin\u00e9ma\" that \"\"Vertigo\", so they say, repelled Americans. French critics, on the contrary, seem to be giving it a warm welcome.\" Praising the film's formal technique, he wrote that \"ideas and forms follow the same road, and it is because the form is pure, beautiful, rigorous, astonishingly rich, and free that we can say that Hitchcock's films, with \"Vertigo\" at their head, are about \"ideas\", in the noble, platonic sense of the word.\"\nHitchcock fans were not pleased with \"Vertigo\"'s departure from the romantic-thriller territory of earlier films, or with the mystery being solved well before the film's ending. Orson Welles disliked the film, telling Henry Jaglom that it was \"worse\" than \"Rear Window\", which he had also disliked. In an interview with Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut, Hitchcock stated that \"Vertigo\" was one of his favourite films, with some reservations. He blamed the film's limited success on the 49-year-old Stewart looking too old to play a convincing love interest for the 24-year-old Novak.\nA young Martin Scorsese viewed the film with his friends during its original theatrical run, and later recalled that \"even though the film was not well received at the time... we responded to the film very strongly. [We] didn't know why... but we really went with the picture.\"\nThe film received awards at the San Sebasti\u00e1n International Film Festival, including a Silver Seashell for Best Director for Hitchcock (tied with Mario Monicelli for \"Big Deal on Madonna Street\") and Best Actor for Stewart (tied with Kirk Douglas in \"The Vikings\"). The film was nominated for two technical Academy Awards for Best Art Direction \u2013 Black-and-White or Color (Hal Pereira, Henry Bumstead, Samuel M. Comer, Frank McKelvy) and Best Sound (George Dutton).\nRe-evaluation.\nOver time the film has been re-evaluated by film critics and has moved higher in esteem in most critics' opinions. Every ten years since 1952, the British Film Institute magazine \"Sight and Sound\" has asked the world's leading film critics to compile a list of the ten greatest films of all time. In the 1962 and 1972 polls, \"Vertigo\" was not among the top 10 films in voting; only in 1982, after Hitchcock's death, did \"Vertigo\" enter the list, in seventh place. By 1992 it had advanced to fourth place, by 2002 to second, and in 2012 to first place in both the crime genre and overall, ahead of previous first-place entry \"Citizen Kane\"; in the 2022 poll, it took second place behind \"Jeanne Dielman, 23 quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles\". In the 2012 \"Sight &amp; Sound\" director's poll of the greatest films ever made \"Vertigo\" was ranked seventh; In the 2002 and 2022 editions of the directors' list the film ranked sixth.\nCommenting upon the 2012 results, the magazine's editor Nick James said that \"Vertigo\" was \"the ultimate critics' film. It is a dream-like film about people who are not sure who they are but who are busy reconstructing themselves and each other to fit a kind of cinema ideal of the ideal soul-mate.\" In recent years, critics have noted that the casting of Stewart as a character who becomes disturbed and obsessive ultimately enhances the film's unconventionality and suspense, since Stewart had previously been known for warmhearted roles.\nIn 1998, \"Time Out\" conducted a poll in which \"Vertigo\" was voted the fifth greatest film of all time. \"The Village Voice\" ranked \"Vertigo\" at No. 3 in its Top 250 \"Best Films of the Century\" list in 1999, based on a poll of critics. \"Entertainment Weekly\" voted it the 19th Greatest film of all time in 1999. In January 2002, the film was included on the list of the \"Top 100 Essential Films of All Time\" by the National Society of Film Critics. In 2009, the film was ranked at No. 10 on Japanese film magazine \"Kinema Junpo\"'s \"Top 10 Non-Japanese Films of All Time\" list. In 2022, \"Time Out\" magazine ranked the film at No.15 on their list of \"The 100 best thriller films of all time\".\nAlready in the 1960s, \"Cahiers du Cin\u00e9ma\" critics had begun re-evaluating Hitchcock as a serious artist. The film ranked eighth on \"Cahiers du Cin\u00e9ma\"'s Top 10 Films of the Year List in 1959. However, even Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut's 1962 book of interviews with Hitchcock devotes only a few pages to \"Vertigo\". Dan Auiler has suggested that the real beginning of \"Vertigo\"'s re-evaluation was the 1968 publication of British-Canadian scholar Robin Wood's book \"Hitchcock's Films\", which called it \"Hitchcock's masterpiece to date and one of the four or five most profound and beautiful films the cinema has yet given us\".\nAdding to its mystique was the fact that \"Vertigo\" was one of five Hitchcock-owned films removed from circulation in 1973. When \"Vertigo\" was re-released in theaters in October 1983, and then on home video in October 1984, it achieved commercial success and laudatory reviews. The October 1996 showing of a restored print on 70 mm film with DTS sound at the Castro Theatre in San Francisco was met with a similarly strong reception. In his 1996 review of the film, critic Roger Ebert gave it four stars out of four and included it in his list of The Great Movies.\nA minority of critics have expressed dissenting opinions. In his 2004 book \"Blockbuster\", British film critic Tom Shone suggested that \"Vertigo\"'s critical re-evaluation has led to excessive praise: \"Hitchcock is a director who delights in getting his plot mechanisms buffed up to a nice humming shine, and so the \"Sight and Sound\" team praise the one film of his in which this is not the case\u00a0\u2013 it's all loose ends and lopsided angles, its plumbing out on display for the critic to pick over at his leisure.\"\nIn 1989, \"Vertigo\" was recognized as a \"culturally, historically and aesthetically significant\" film by the United States Library of Congress and selected for preservation in the National Film Registry in the first year of the registry's voting.\nIn 2005, \"Vertigo\" was ranked at number two in \"Total Film\" magazine's \"100 Greatest Movies of All Time,\" behind only \"Goodfellas\". In 2008, an \"Empire\" poll of readers, actors, and critics named it the 40th greatest movie ever made. The film was voted at No. 8 on the 2008 list of \"100 Greatest Films\" by \"Cahiers du Cin\u00e9ma\". In 2010, \"The Guardian\" ranked it as the third-best crime film of all time. \"Vertigo\" ranked third on the BBC's 2015 list of the 100 greatest American films.\nOn review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 93% based on 87 reviews, with an average rating of 8.90/10. The website's critics' consensus deems it \"an unpredictable scary thriller that doubles as a mournful meditation on love, loss, and human comfort\". As of February 2024, \"Vertigo\" is one of only fourteen films with a perfect score on Metacritic (two other Hitchcock films, \"Notorious\" and \"Rear Window\", are also on the list).\nThe most recent edition of the American Film Institute's top 100 films of all time, released in 2007, placed Vertigo at number nine, up 52 positions from its placement at number 61 in the original 1998 list.\nAmerican Film Institute recognition\nThe San Francisco locations have become celebrated amongst the film's fans, with organized tours across the area. In March 1997, the French magazine \"Les Inrockuptibles\" published a special issue about \"Vertigo's\" locations in San Francisco, \"Dans le d\u00e9cor\".\nDirectors Martin Scorsese and Denis Villeneuve have listed \"Vertigo\" as among their favorite films of all time.\nThe renewed public appreciation for \"Vertigo\" is accompanied by a growing body of academic scholarship. Conferences like the Annual International Vertigo conference, for instance, showcase this trend, as evidenced by its 2018 event at Trinity College Dublin.\nClassification as film noir.\nCritical opinion is divided on whether or not \"Vertigo\" should be considered an example of film noir. Some consider it a film noir on the basis of plot and tone and various motifs, despite it having mid-century modern visuals typical of the 1950s. Others say the use of Technicolor, color symbolism, and the specificity of Hitchcock's vision exclude it from the category. Nicholas Christopher, Robert Ottoson, and Silver and Ward, for instance, do not include \"Vertigo\" in their filmographies of film noir. By contrast, Foster Hirsch describes \"Vertigo\" as among the Hitchcock films that are \"richly, demonstrably \"noir\"\".\nPotential remake.\nIn March 2023, it was reported that Paramount Pictures had acquired the remake rights to the film, with Steven Knight set to write the script and Robert Downey Jr. set to star.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The short was released on July 6, 1957, and stars Bugs Bunny and Elmer Fudd.\nThe story features Elmer chasing Bugs through a parody of 19th-century classical composer Richard Wagner's operas, particularly \"Der Ring des Nibelungen\" (\"The Ring of the Nibelung\"), \"Der Fliegende Holl\u00e4nder\" (\"The Flying Dutchman\"), and \"Tannh\u00e4user\". It borrows heavily from the second opera in the \"Ring Cycle\" \"Die Walk\u00fcre\", woven around the typical Bugs\u2013Elmer feud. Most of the dialogue is performed in recitative. The short marks the final appearance of Elmer Fudd in a Chuck Jones cartoon.\nIt has been widely praised in the animation industry as the greatest animated cartoon that Warner Bros. ever released, and it has been ranked as such in the top 50 animated cartoons of all time. In 1992, the Library of Congress deemed it \"culturally, historically or aesthetically significant\" and selected it for preservation in the National Film Registry.\nPlot.\nDressed as the demigod Siegfried (and cutting a less than impressive figure as such), Elmer Fudd is pursuing Bugs Bunny when he finds rabbit tracks and arrives at Bugs' hole. Elmer jams his spear into the hole while singing \"Kill the wabbit!\" repeatedly to the tune of \"Ride of the Valkyries\". Bugs sticks his head out of another rabbit hole and converses with Elmer about his spear and magic helmet. This prompts a display of Elmer-as-Siegfried's magic powers. Bugs flees in fear, and Elmer pursues.\nElmer stops in his tracks at the sight of the beautiful Valkyrie Br\u00fcnnhilde (Bugs in drag). \"Siegfried\" and \"Br\u00fcnnhilde\" exchange endearments and perform a ballet (based on the Venusberg ballet in \"Tannh\u00e4user\"). Bugs' true identity is exposed when his headdress falls off, enraging Elmer. Bugs discards his disguise and runs. Elmer's wrath causes a storm to brew, tearing apart the mountains where Bugs has fled. Upon seeing Bugs' lifeless body, Elmer regrets his wrath and tearfully carries Bugs off to Valhalla in keeping with the Wagnerian theme per Act III of the Valkyries. Bugs breaks the fourth wall and raises his head to address the audience, \"Well, what did you expect in an opera? A \"happy\" ending?\" before going back to playing dead again.\nProduction.\nOriginally released to theaters by Warner Bros. on July 6, 1957, \"What's Opera, Doc?\" features the speaking and singing voices of Mel Blanc and Arthur Q. Bryan as Bugs and Elmer, respectively. This is the third of the three Warner Bros. shorts (the others being \"Hare Brush\" and \"Rabbit Rampage\") in which Elmer defeats Bugs, though here the former shows regret for defeating the latter. It was the last Elmer Fudd cartoon directed by Jones.\n\"What's Opera, Doc?\" required about six times as much work and expense as any of the other six-minute cartoons his production unit was turning out at the time. Jones admitted as much, having described a surreptitious re-allocation of production time to complete the short. During the six minutes of \"What's Opera, Doc?\", Jones lampoons Disney's \"Fantasia\", the contemporary style of ballet, Wagner's perceived ponderous operatic style, and even the by-then clich\u00e9d Bugs-and-Elmer formula.\nIn his autobiography \"Chuck Amuck\", Jones singled out \"What's Opera, Doc?\" \"for sheer production quality, magnificent music and wonderful animation, this is probably our (unit's) most elaborate and satisfying production\".\nStory development and layout.\nMichael Maltese wrote the parody's storyline and, in collaboration with Chuck Jones, the comedic lyrics set to Wagner's music, including the duet \"Return My Love\". Some elements of the cartoon drew upon previous animated works at Warner Bros. Maltese himself had originated the concept of depicting Bugs in Valkyrie-styled drag and mounted on a fat horse. Twelve years before the production of \"What's Opera, Doc?\", he had devised a very similar sequence for the cartoon \"Herr Meets Hare\" directed by Friz Freleng. That anti-Nazi short was released by Warner Bros. to American theaters in January 1945, just several months before Germany's surrender to Allied forces in World War II. Wearing a blonde braided wig under a medieval horned helmet and carrying a shield, Bugs in that earlier film rides across the screen to the tune of \"Pilgrim's Chorus\", a selection from Wagner's 1845 opera \"Tannh\u00e4user\".\nThe highly stylized backdrops and entire color scheme for \"What's Opera, Doc?\" were done by art director Maurice Noble and were reportedly so \"daring\" at the time that the production's overall design \"sent the studio into a tizzy\". Noble later remarked, \"They thought I was bats when I put that bright red on Elmer with those purple skies\". According to him, some employees in Warner's Ink and Paint Department assumed that a variety of color specifications he sent to them were errors. Staff, Noble recalled, would ask questions such as \"'You really mean you want that magenta red on that?' And I said, 'Yes, that's the way.'\"\nMissing sound effect.\nDuring the final editing of the short, a \"tiny sound effect\" was omitted from the master footage, an omission that for decades continued to disturb Chuck Jones whenever he viewed the cartoon after its initial release. In August 2017, the online animation journal \"The Dot and Line\" published an interview it conducted with Stephen Fossati, who was Jones' \"last prot\u00e9g\u00e9\", working with him from 1993 until his death in 2002. Fossati in that interview spoke with Eric Vilas-Boas, the co-founder of \"The Dot and Line\", about Jones' \"diligence to his craft\" and his \"relentless perfectionism\". With regard to the absent sound effect, Vilas-Boas quoted Fossati's comments about his mentor's 45-year obsession with that \"minuscule\" detail in the film:&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"It's like at least probably a dozen, two dozen times that I had the privilege of watching [\"What's Opera, Doc?\"] with Chuck... Every time, we'd get to the point where Elmer Fudd is jabbing the spear into the rabbit hole, and Bugs Bunny pops up and freezes, and Elmer Fudd freezes looking at Bugs Bunny, and the plates of his skirt fumble around. It's one of the things that bothered Chuck to the very end... [Chuck] had always intended that those plates fell, inverted, fell on Elmer Fudd's skirt. That they would go \"Dink, dink, dink, dink, dink, dink, dink, dink, dink\", but Treg Brown [the sound editor responsible for the short] forgot to put the sound effects in. [Chuck] would watch it, and every time he would watch it, he'd give a, 'Hurgh.' Sort of like, 'I can't believe that happened.' It was quite remarkable... You can watch it. Watch the cartoon... When, it's 'Kill the wabbit! Kill the wabbit! Kill the wabbit?' He's frozen there, and you just see the \"'Dink, dink, dink, dink\".' Now you'll hear it.\"\nHistory.\n\"Kill the Wabbit\".\n\"What's Opera, Doc?\" is sometimes referred to informally and in online and printed references as \"Kill the Wabbit\". This unofficial, alternative title is derived from the line sung by Elmer to the tune of Wagner's \"Ride of the Valkyries\", part of the opening passage from Act Three of \"Die Walk\u00fcre\", which is also the leitmotif of the Valkyries.\nOperatic legacy.\nFor his 2016 article about the cartoon, \"How Bugs Bunny and 'Kill the Wabbit' Inspired a Generation of Opera Stars\", Michael Phillips of \"The Wall Street Journal\" examined how \"a cartoon rabbit and his speech-impaired nemesis\" provided many children in 1957 and in the decades thereafter their first, albeit absurd exposure to Wagner's compositions and to the world of opera.\nPhillips in his article furnishes comments by various operatic performers and stage crews regarding how seeing \"What's Opera, Doc?\" affected them personally as children and in some cases contributed to the early development of their operatic careers. Mezzo-soprano Elizabeth Bishop\u2014a native of Greenville, South Carolina and a featured performer at the Washington National Opera, the San Francisco Opera, and the Metropolitan Opera\u2014stated to Phillips, \"'I could sing you the entire cartoon before I knew what opera really was'\", adding \"'Those of us who didn't freak at the sight of a rabbit in a winged helmet sliding off of the back of a fat horse\u2014we went into opera.'\" Jamie Barton, another notable American mezzo-soprano, also shared with Phillips her reactions to seeing the short for the first time in the mid-1990s, when she was a middle-schooler growing up in Athens, Georgia. As she prepared in 2016 for her performance as Waltraute in Wagner's \"G\u00f6tterd\u00e4mmerung\" at the Kennedy Center in Washington, DC, Barton reflected on \"What's Opera, Doc?\" and credited it and Warner Bros.' earlier burlesque short \"Rabbit of Seville\" with initially drawing her attention to opera and instilling in her a \"love\" for classical works, especially the music of Italian composer Gioachino Rossini. \"I had never been exposed to opera music before Bugs Bunny\", she remarked to Philips.\nMichael Heaston, a former pianist for the Dallas Opera and in 2016 an adviser to the director of the Washington National Opera, also described to Phillips his memories of seeing \"What's Opera, Doc?\" and other Warner Bros. cartoons as a small child in West Des Moines, Iowa. For Heaston those shorts served as catalysts that ultimately led him to establishing a career in opera. \"'At a very base level'\", he noted, \"'that's what I got from Looney Tunes at a very early age: I learned how to tell stories through music.'\"\n50th anniversary, 2007.\nThe enduring audience appeal of \"What's Opera Doc?\" extends beyond stage professionals and the borders of the United States. In Canada in 2007, the \"Toronto Star\" newspaper featured in its July 8 issue an article by Steve Watt titled \"50 glorious years of 'kill da wabbit'\". Watt, a cartoon historian and owner of an animation art gallery in Toronto, discusses in his article the golden anniversary that two days earlier had marked the initial release of the short, and he assesses its continuing popularity. \"No one\", he writes, \"who knows and loves 'What's Opera, Doc?' will ever hear Wagner's 'Der Ring des Nibelungen' without hearing, in their own minds, 'Kill da wabbit...kill da wabbit.'\" Watt continues, \"While classical music aficionados may be offended by that fact, I'm okay with it. More than okay with it.\" He then describes a past event he had organized and held at a Toronto movie theater, where he presented a selection of Chuck Jones' cartoons. He also describes the audience's reaction to seeing the shorts on the \"big screen\", including \"What's Opera, Doc?\":&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt; A few years ago, when I staged a tribute to Chuck and his incredible body of work, showing 15 of his greatest cartoons on the big screen as they were originally meant to be seen, it wasn't \"What's Opera, Doc?\" that got the biggest reaction, initially. The nearly 500 people in attendance gave their most enthusiastic reaction to the opening credits of \"One Froggy Evening\" featuring Michigan J. Frog, and \"Rabbit of Seville,\" the famous Bugs Bunny-Elmer Fudd barbershop ditty. Both great cartoons, to be sure, and both on any animation historian's top 10. The interesting thing was that for weeks afterward, people told me how moved they were by \"What's Opera, Doc?\" Some had never seen it before. Others had seen it on TV, but absent the big screen and big sound, they had failed to fall under its spell. Seeing it that day, the way audiences first saw it in 1957, they were enthralled.\nSuch reactions to \"the Wagnerian mini epic\" a half century after its release once again attest to the cartoon's unique composition and appeal, qualities that were even recognized as \"special\" in 1957 by some film-industry publications. For example, the Philadelphia-based journal \"Motion Picture Exhibitor\", which in 1957 had a readership composed largely of theater owners and managers, reviewed the short in August that year and rated it \"excellent\". The \"Exhibitor\" then prophetically observed, \"This is far above the usual run of animated cartoons and should find special favor in art houses, believe it or not.\"\nAddition to National Film Registry and rankings.\nIn 1992, the United States Library of Congress deemed \"What's Opera, Doc?\" \"'culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant'\" and selected it for induction to the National Film Registry, making it the first short cartoon to receive that honor. Two more Warner Bros. cartoons were later inducted into the registry: \"Duck Amuck\" in 1999 and \"One Froggy Evening\" in 2003. Their inclusion made Chuck Jones the only animator with three shorts thus recognized.\n\"What's Opera, Doc?\" in 1994 ranked number one on a list of \"The 50 Greatest Cartoons\" of all time. The list, compiled by animation historian Jerry Beck, was the result of his surveying and evaluating the opinions of 1,000 professional animators. One of those professionals was Steve Schneider, a longtime employee of Warner Bros. and an authority on the history of animated productions at the studio and an avid collector of cartoon art. In Beck's survey, Schneider provides his own assessment of what makes this short so outstanding:&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;From its first images, that of the would-be awesome Fantasia-like figures devolving into the shadow of puny lisping Elmer Fudd, the film piles up pretensions only in order to mow them down. Gloriously overbaked, the film reveals that ultimately, it was only cooking up fodder for satire. By reducing Wagner's \"Ring\" into a subtext for an archetypal Bugs and Elmer chase, \"What's Opera, Doc?\" pulls off a dazzling mingling of reverence and ridicule.\nReferences.\nNotes\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography"}

Carlos) and shown to Walt Disney on his trip to Rio de Janeiro in 1941. The Walt Disney Company then incorporated the idea, being introduced in the 1942 film \"Saludos Amigos\" as a friend of Donald Duck, described by \"Time\" as \"a dapper Brazilian parrot, who is as superior to Donald Duck as the Duck was to Mickey Mouse.\" He speaks Portuguese. He returned in the 1944 film \"The Three Caballeros\" along with Donald and a Mexican rooster named Panchito Pistoles. Jos\u00e9 is from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil (thus the name \"Carioca\", which is a term used for a person born in Rio).\nAppearances.\nAnimation.\nIn addition to \"Saludos Amigos\" and \"The Three Caballeros\" (the Latin American film pair), Jos\u00e9 appeared with Donald and the Aracuan Bird in the \"Blame It on the Samba\" segment of the 1948 anthology feature \"Melody Time\".\nHe also appeared in the segment \"Two Happy Amigos\" in a 1960 episode of the anthology television series \"Walt Disney Presents\". Much later, he was seen in the Disney Channel series \"Mickey Mouse Works\" and \"House of Mouse\", as well as in two episodes of \"Mickey and the Roadster Racers\" (\"Mickey's Perfecto Day!\" and \"Super-Charged: Daisy's Grande Goal\") and two episodes of \"Mickey Mouse Funhouse\" (\"D\u00eda de Muertos\" and \"Nochebuena no Funhouse\") alongside Panchito. He also made a brief cameo in the 1988 film \"Who Framed Roger Rabbit\".\nIn the \"Mickey Mouse\" short \"O Futebol Cl\u00e1ssico\", Jos\u00e9 is seen as the announcer of a Brazilian soccer game. He later appears with Donald and Panchito in \"\u00a1Feliz Cumplea\u00f1os!\" as performers at Mickey's birthday and in \"Carnaval\" as a performer in the parade.\nJos\u00e9 starred in the main role of \"Legend of the Three Caballeros\", alongside Panchito Pistoles and Donald Duck, which was released on the Disney Life app. Jos\u00e9's cigar was removed in this series. He is voiced by Eric Bauza in this version.\nHe also appeared in a recurring role in the 2017 \"DuckTales\" series, voiced by Bernardo de Paula, where he and Panchito used to be Donald's old college bandmates who return to kickstart their band again. He's revealed to work as a flight attendant and uses his umbrella as a weapon against enemies.\nJos\u00e9 also has a cameo appearance in the 2023 short film \"Once Upon a Studio\", as part of the Walt Disney Animation Studios characters that take a group photo.\nComics.\nIn the early 1940s, the Sunday-only \"Silly Symphony\" comic strip featured Jos\u00e9 Carioca, in a series running from October 11, 1942 to October 1, 1944. This was replaced by a Panchito strip, which ran for another year.\nJos\u00e9 is quite popular in Brazil, appearing alongside Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck in the local Disney comics. In Brazil, he is known as Z\u00e9 Carioca (\"Z\u00e9\" being a familiar form for Portuguese name \"Jos\u00e9\", in much the same way \"Joe\" is a familiar form for the English name \"Joseph\"). Between 1961 and 2018, he had his Brazilian comic books, in which he is portrayed as living with his friends Nestor (an anthropomorphic crow), Afonsinho (an anthropomorphic duck), and Pedr\u00e3o (an anthropomorphic dog), along with other characters: his nephews \"Zico\" and \"Zeca\" (also parrots), his girlfriend Maria Vaz (Portuguese: \"Rosinha Vaz\", another anthropomorphic parrot), daughter of rich entrepreneur Rocha Vaz (an anthropomorphic toucan), and his romantic rival \"Z\u00e9 Galo\" (an anthropomorphic rooster). Local production ended in 2001, but was restarted in 2012. Jos\u00e9 now has a pet, Old Tom, an alligator originated from the 1960s Studio Program duck stories. Since September 2020, new Jos\u00e9 stories are published by Culturama in the comic book \"Aventuras Disney\".\nComics featuring Joe Carioca, as he is called in the Netherlands, appear occasionally in the Dutch \"Donald Duck\" magazine. In these short stories, Jos\u00e9 occupies his time assuming false identities to impress girls (who usually see through him, leaving him brokenhearted), and wangling free dinners in expensive restaurants, a habit that often gets him into trouble.\nHe appears extremely rarely in the German \"Micky Maus\" comics and Lustiges Taschenbuch, having appeared around 10 times since his 1980 debut.\nIn the Brazilian comics, Z\u00e9 is also part of his neighborhood soccer team and runs a samba school. He has a secret identity as a superhero, \"Morcego Verde\" (\"Green Bat\", a Batman spoof), although he is easily recognized by his neighbors.\nIn recent years, Jos\u00e9 Carioca has been used alongside Panchito and Donald in two comics by American artist Don Rosa, \"The Three Caballeros Ride Again\" (2000) and \"The Magnificent Seven (Minus 4) Caballeros\" (2005). The creation of a Brazilian animated character during the Second World War was part of a strategy called \"Good Neighbor Policy\" headed by the United States government to improve relations and gather support amongst its neighbor countries.\nIn 2023, Dutch stories introduced Parquita, Jos\u00e9's new girlfriend.\nDisney Parks.\nIn April 2007, Disney re-introduced Jos\u00e9 Carioca (along with the third Caballero, Panchito) in the newly revamped ride at Epcot's Mexico Pavilion with entirely new animation and a new storyline. It has been dubbed \"The Gran Fiesta Tour\". After being reunited, The Three Caballeros are set to play a show in Mexico City. But Donald goes missing. Jos\u00e9 and Panchito must search throughout Mexico for Donald as he takes in various sights around Mexico. The character was previously voiced by Rob Paulsen, although in June 2020 Paulsen announced that, as a Caucasian voice actor, he will no longer play characters of color, including the Brazilian Jos\u00e9.\nJos\u00e9 can also be seen in the Hong Kong Disneyland version of It's a Small World, which opened on April 28, 2008, as well as the Disneyland (in California) version of It's a Small World, installed during major refurbishments between January and November 2008, also as the Tokyo Disneyland version of It's a Small World, installed during major refurbishments between March 2017 and April 2018.\nJos\u00e9 and Panchito's costumes were extinct at the Disneyland Resort by 2011, but were re-Imagineered for Mickey's Soundsational Parade in May 2011.

{"id": "76622", "revid": "26081306", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=76622", "title": "Waterloo (album)", "text": "1974 studio album by ABBA\nWaterloo is the second studio album by the Swedish pop group ABBA, and the first released internationally. It was originally released on 4 March 1974 in Sweden through Polar Music. The album's title track won ABBA the 1974 Eurovision Song Contest and became a global hit, launching the group's career.\nRecording.\nRecording sessions for \"Waterloo\" began on 24 September 1973 with the track \"Dance (While the Music Still Goes On)\". This song was unusual in that it is the only ABBA track not to feature member Benny Andersson on keyboards, instead featuring American pianist John \"Rabbit\" Bundrick who was in Sweden at the time. Bundrick, however, was not credited on the album. Three weeks later the next two songs (\"Suzy-Hang-Around\" and \"My Mama Said\") went into the studio. A recording sheet from the day credits the artist as \"ABBA\", the first time the name was ever used in writing (the group had previously been called \"Bj\u00f6rn &amp; Benny, Agnetha &amp; Anni-Frid\"), although their manager Stig Anderson had informally been calling them ABBA with the media for some time. The former of these songs marks the only time Benny Andersson sang lead on a track. Two more tracks were recorded on 17 October; \"What About Livingstone\" and \"Honey Honey\" \u2013 the latter being the second single released from the album in most countries. \"King Kong Song\" was recorded on 14 November, a song which members Benny Andersson and Bj\u00f6rn Ulvaeus today single out as one of their weakest tracks. This was also the date in which it was announced that ABBA were to appear at the Swedish selection for the 1974 Eurovision Song Contest. \nFrom that point, recording sessions sped up and the rest of the tracks were recorded. Two songs were up for consideration for their Eurovision entry; \"Waterloo\" and \"Hasta Ma\u00f1ana\". The group preferred the former but felt the latter was a safer bet. Ultimately they chose \"Waterloo\" as it was more the direction they wished to take the group. \"Waterloo\" and \"Watch Out\" were recorded on the same day, with the latter becoming the B-side to the former.\nRelease.\n\"Waterloo\" was released in March 1974. It was first released on CD in Sweden in 1988 alongside \"Ring Ring\" and the self titled album. It is the only CD version of the album to follow the original Scandinavian LP's running order. Polydor first released \"Waterloo\", along with \"Ring Ring\", throughout Europe in 1990, with the discs being pressed in West Germany. These discs follow the running order of the Waterloo LP that was released in The Netherlands, swapping \"Watch Out\" and \"What About Livingstone\" in the tracklist. In 1995, Polydor reissued their pressings of all of ABBA's albums in the United States. The album has been reissued in digitally remastered form several times: in 1997 as part of \"The ABBA Remasters\" series, then in 2001 with an updated cover artwork and some bonus tracks, again in 2005 as part of \"The Complete Studio Recordings\" box set, and most recently in 2014 as a 40th anniversary \"Deluxe Edition\" reissue. This version of the album entered the UK album charts.\nOn 5 April 2024, a new collection of vinyl products was released for the album's 50th anniversary celebration, featuring: a double-LP 45-rpm half-speed mastered gatefold version of the album; a seven-inch box set with colored discs (red, white and blue) of \"Honey, Honey\" / \"King Kong Song\", \"Waterloo\"/ \"Watch Out\" and \"Waterloo (Swedish Version)\" / \"Honey, Honey (Swedish Version)\", respectively; and individual 7-inch picture discs of these same three singles. A 10-inch limited edition \"Waterloo\" single was also released, featuring the four different language versions of the track. The half-speed high-quality audio was mastered by Miles Showell at Abbey Road Studios.\nDeluxe edition.\nOn 7 April 2014, \"Waterloo\" was reissued as a 2-disc deluxe edition package for its 40th anniversary. The first disc consisted of a CD version of the original album, expanded with eight bonus tracks, and featuring: all the language versions of \"Waterloo\" (including an alternate mix of the English version), the Swedish version of \"Honey, Honey\", and the 1974 US remix of \"Ring, Ring\".\nThe second disc, a DVD, contained the \"International Sleeve Gallery\" along with thirteen TV appearances, eight of which were performances of \"Waterloo\": two from the \"Eurovision Song Contest\", with a preview performance on SVT; two from \"Melodifestivalen\", three from \"Top of the Pops\", and one German performance from NDR's \"Musik aus Studio B\". The remaining TV content included performances of \"Honey, Honey\" on \"Disco\" (ZDF), \"Spotlight\" (ORF), and \"Ein Kessel Buntes\" (Fernsehen der DDR), as well as an interview with Frida and Stig Anderson, following the band's Eurovision victory. \nThe set also came with a 20-page illustrated booklet with an essay on the making of the album. It is the last release from the ABBA Deluxe Edition album series.\nAlbum cover.\nThe album's cover features the sub-title \"Bj\u00f6rn, Benny, Agnetha &amp; Frida\" although some editions replaced 'Agnetha' with 'Anna' \u2013 by which Agnetha F\u00e4ltskog was known in some countries. The cover photo was taken at Gripsholm Castle, in Mariefred, Sweden, and features bass player Mike Watson dressed as Napoleon.\nCritical reception.\n\"Waterloo\" swept to victory at the Swedish heats and the group represented Sweden in Brighton, England, for the Eurovision Song Contest 1974. ABBA won the contest and \"Waterloo\" became not only a massive hit in Europe but all over the world (peaking at No. 6 in the US, for example). In Sweden, the album had already been released and topped the Swedish album charts for 12 weeks, becoming one of the biggest-selling Swedish albums ever to that point. In the UK the album made No. 28, the first time a foreign Eurovision act had charted an album, and it performed well in the rest of Europe.\nAfter the Melodifestovalen victory, Swedish tabloid newspaper \"Aftonbladet\"'s Christer Faleij reviewed the album on 1 March 1974, before the release of the album. Faleij gave the album a positive review in Swedish calling it an \"incredibly professional production\": &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Without necessarily making a fuss, it can be briefly stated that the quartet is still taking a giant leap towards the international market. It's about streamlined, practical music with stylish vocals and driven arrangements. Quite in keeping with the style, it starts with \"Waterloo\" in Swedish and ends with the same song in English. In between, there are 10 tracks, of which at least a couple have as good a chance as \"Waterloo\" to really hit the spot. Personally, I believe \"Honey Honey\" will be another big seller. It would also have placed well in the Swedish selection. And \"Watch Out\" with its heavy accompaniment will also be a success. There are several themes running through the album: soft and heavy pop, a not-so-small nod to the Supremes in \"What About Livingstone\", a hit in \"Hasta Ma\u00f1ana\". Benny Andersson together with Bj\u00f6rn Ulvaeus is responsible for most of the material. In three melodies, Stikkan Anderson has stepped in as a lyricist. All lyrics except the Swedish version of \"Waterloo\" are in English. The majority of the songs creep in and stay. They are simple, uncomplicated melody loops that are easy to understand. \"Waterloo\" has already passed the so-called gold mark, even though the album is not yet available in stores. This is through pre-orders. I think it will be very exciting for Swedish people in Brighton on April 6.\nAmerican magazine \"Cash Box\" reported: &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;[The] album is a positive blast of inspirational music. The disk has all the potential to break big here in the U.S. as it has in England and the group sounds like an enthusiastic musical powerhouse. Particularly enjoyable are \"Sitting In The Palmtree.\" \"Honey, Honey,\" \"Ring Ring.\" \"Suzy Hang Around,- and \"Dance (While The Music Still Goes On).\" If thegroup's sound begins to pick up the kind of response it has as a result of \"Waterloo.\" look for another supergroup.\nReviews of the album were positive with \"Phonograph Record\"'s Greg Shaw stating that it \"might just turn out to be one of the classic d\u00e9but LPs of the '70s\". \"Rolling Stone\" also gave the album a favourable review. In a 3-star retropective review, Bruce Eder from AllMusic said that the album was \"unusual in the group's output\" due to the \"variety of sounds\" and because \"the guys are still featured fairly prominently in some of the vocals\". He wrote, in relation to \"King Kong Song\", that \"when the women's voices jump in on the choruses, it's hard not to listen attentively; the quartet knew what a powerful weapon they had, but not quite how to use it\".\nTrack listing.\nThe information is based on the Swedish version of the album and has been adapted from the official ABBA website. All tracks are written by Benny Andersson and Bj\u00f6rn Ulvaeus, except where noted.\nNotes\nDeluxe edition.\nReleased for the album's 40th anniversary, this edition also features the Swedish version of \"Waterloo\" as a bonus track.

Blake, Rene Rogers, William Haben and C. Norman Hammond. The film tells the story of a district attorney (Power Sr.) who, while prosecuting a doctor for illegal abortions, finds out that society people, including his wife, used the doctor's services.\nPlot.\nRichard Walton, a district attorney, is presented with an obscenity case: A medical practitioner, Dr. Homer, has been arrested for distributing 'indecent' birth control literature. On the stand, Dr. Homer makes a strong case for legalizing contraception. He recounts three incidents from his medical practice, each shown in a brief flashback: children are exposed to violent abuse in a family riddled with alcoholism; an impoverished family is unable to provide adequate medical care for their sick children; and a single mother, abandoned by her male lover, commits suicide with her young infant.\nMeanwhile, Richard's wife, Edith, has been keeping a secret from him for many years: she has been seeing a doctor, one Herman Malfit, who performs abortions so that her busy social life will not be interrupted by the inconvenience of pregnancy. She suggests it as an option for her friend Mrs. William Carlo, who is with child. Mrs. Carlo has the abortion.\nThe Waltons receive two new guests in their house almost simultaneously: Edith Walton's ne'er-do-well younger brother, and their maid's young daughter, Lillian. Smitten by the brother's advances, the maid's daughter is seduced and soon finds herself pregnant. She is taken to Dr. Malfit and then abandoned by the boy after the operation goes wrong. Making her way back to the Walton mansion, she collapses and dies from the botched abortion.\nFollowing Malfit's arrest and trial, Richard Walton examines the doctor's ledgers and realized that his wife and many of her friends are listed as having received 'personal services.' He returns home, furious, to find them lunching at his home. He banishes his wife's friends, saying 'I should bring you to trial for manslaughter!' and confronts Edith with the cry, 'where are my children?' She is overcome with remorse. As the years pass, the couple must contend with a lonely, childless life, full of longing for the family they might have had.\nCast.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;* Tyrone Power Sr. as District Attorney Richard Walton (as Mr. Tyrone Power)\nThemes.\nThe film was inspired by the 1914 obscenity case of Margaret Sanger in New York in which she was prosecuted for distributing information about birth control through the U.S. postal system. This had been made illegal by the 1873 Comstock Act, which defined birth control as obscene. It stands as one of the best surviving examples of Lois Weber's social problem films.\nEugenics and family planning are discussed didactically in the film, and examples of desirable or undesirable children (the results of good or bad breeding respectively) are shown.\nWhile the film presents an argument for birth control, it takes a firm stance against abortion, portraying the wealthy women as procuring abortions on a whim when pregnancy threatens to interfere with their social lives. According to some critics, the film also portrays abortion inaccurately, suggesting that it is inherently harmful to patients both physically and mentally. At the time Weber made the film, 'back alley' and 'illegal' abortions were prevalent and quite often resulted in destroying women's ability to have future children. It is left clear at the film's end Mrs. Walton can no longer have children because her body is damaged by a long-term overindulgence in abortions.\nProduction.\nThe film was written by Lucy Payton, Franklin Hall, Lois Weber and Phillips Smalley. No director is credited. Future star Mary MacLaren made her debut in this film playing the Walton's younger maid. Shooting took place in the Los Angeles area, and at the Universal studio facilities in Hollywood. The Waltons are played by Tyrone Power Sr. and Helen Riaume, who at the time were real life husband and wife. Anne Power, their daughter, has a small role.\nThe film makes use of several trick photography scenes, with an emphasis on multiple exposures to convey information or emotions visually. This is especially evident in the final scene of the film. As a recurring motif, every time a character becomes pregnant, a child's face is double exposed over their shoulder.\nWeber returned to the topic of birth control the following year, with a film called \"The Hand That Rocks the Cradle\", in which she plays the principal role of Louise Broome, a birth control advocate imprisoned for her work.\nReception.\nThe film was widely viewed in the U.S. and made Lois Weber popular. It did well in New York City and in Manhattan, after a court case was dismissed and the film was allowed to be exhibited. In Atlantic City, the film played to packed houses. Critics praised the film for its delicate handling of sensitive subject matter and attention to detail and dramatic qualities. However, in Pennsylvania, the film was banned, even after several edited submissions to the censors. They felt that it was filth and no amount of editing could make the film fit for decent people to see.\nPreservation.\nIn 1993, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\". A 2000 DVD release featured a reconstructed piano score written and performed by Martin Marks. A 2007 DVD release featured full orchestration of the Marks score, as arranged by Allen Feinstein, and expert audio commentary by film historian Shelley Stamp. A 2018 DVD/Blu-ray release featured a new piano score by Maud Nelissen.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Sister-inline/styles.css\"/&gt; Media related to at Wikimedia Commons"}

Set in Latin America, it is made up of four different segments; Donald Duck stars in two of them and Goofy stars in one. It also features the first appearance of Jos\u00e9 Carioca, the malandro Brazilian parrot. \"Saludos Amigos\" premiered in Rio de Janeiro on August 24, 1942. It was released in the United States on February 19, 1943.\nThe film was a success, helping launch the international popularity of Donald Duck and leading Disney to produce \"The Three Caballeros\" (1944), another government-funded film aimed at Latin American goodwill.\nBackground.\nIn early 1941, before U.S. entry into World War II, the United States Department of State commissioned a Disney goodwill tour of South America, intended to lead to a movie to be shown in the US, Central, and South America as part of the Good Neighbor Policy. This was being done because several Latin American governments had close ties with Nazi Germany, and the US government wanted to counteract those ties. Mickey Mouse and other Disney characters were popular in Latin America, and Walt Disney acted as ambassador. The tour, facilitated by Nelson Rockefeller, who had recently been appointed as Coordinator of Inter-American Affairs (CIAA), took Disney and a group of roughly twenty composers, artists, technicians, etc. from his studio to South America, mainly to Brazil and Argentina, but also to Chile, Bolivia and Peru.\nThe film itself was given federal loan guarantees, because the Disney studio had over-expanded just before European markets were closed to them by the war, and because Disney was struggling with labor unrest at the time (including a strike that was underway at the time the goodwill journey began).\nThe film included live-action documentary sequences featuring footage of modern Latin American cities with skyscrapers and fashionably dressed residents. This surprised many contemporary US viewers, who associated such images only with US and European cities, and contributed to a changing impression of Latin America. Film historian Alfred Charles Richard Jr. has commented that \"Saludos Amigos\" \"did more to cement a community of interest between peoples of the Americas in a few months than the State Department had in fifty years.\"\nThe film also inspired Chilean cartoonist Ren\u00e9 R\u00edos Boettiger to create Condorito, one of Latin America's most ubiquitous cartoon characters. R\u00edos perceived that the character \"Pedro\", a small, incapable airplane, was a slight to Chileans and created a comic that could supposedly rival Disney's comic characters.\nPlot\nThe film features segments of 5 countries in South America: Peru, Bolivia, Argentina, Chile, and Brazil. Each country has its own segment except for Bolivia and Peru, because both countries are represented in the Lake Titicaca segment.\nFilm segments.\nThis film features four different segments, each of which begin with various clips of the Disney artists roaming the country, drawing cartoons of some of the local cultures and scenery they see.\n\"Lake Titicaca\".\nIn this segment, the Disney artists make a cartoon where Donald Duck visits Lake Titicaca in Bolivia and Peru and meets some of the locals, including an obstinate llama as an American tourist. When Donald tries to ride the llama over a bridge, he ends up falling into the sea and rows away in pots and pans.\n\"Pedro\".\n\"Pedro\" is a story about a small anthropomorphic airplane from an airport near Santiago, Chile, engaging in his first flight to retrieve air mail from Mendoza, with disastrous consequences. He manages to safely return to the airfield with the mail, which happens to be a single postcard. RKO Pictures released this particular segment as a theatrical short on May 13, 1955.\nChilean cartoonist Ren\u00e9 R\u00edos Boettiger (known popularly as \"Pepo\") was disappointed with how the character Pedro represented his country. In response, he developed the character \"Condorito\", who went on to become one of the most iconic comic magazine characters in Latin America.\n\"El Gaucho Goofy\".\nIn this segment, American cowboy Goofy gets taken from Texas to the Argentinian pampas by the Narrator to learn the ways of the native gaucho. This segment was later edited for the film's Gold Classic Collection VHS/DVD release to remove one scene in which Goofy is shown smoking a cigarette. This edit appears again on the Classic Caballeros Collection DVD. This sequence has since been restored as the unedited version has been much requested. The fully unedited version is available as a bonus feature on the \"Walt &amp; El Grupo\" DVD release and fully unedited and restored on \"Saludos Amigos and The Three Caballeros 75th Anniversary Edition 2-Movie Collection\" Blu-ray. When the film was released on Disney's streaming platform Disney+, the edited version of the sequence was used despite disclaimers of the film being presented in its original format with \"outdated cultural depictions\" and tobacco usage, but it has since been changed to the unedited version.\n\"Aquarela do Brasil\".\n\"Aquarela do Brasil\" (Portuguese for \"Watercolor of Brazil\"), the finale of the film, views Disney artists creating pictures that magically turn into different pictures. One of them is a flower, which turns into Donald Duck after a bee goes into his mouth. When the bee flies out of his mouth, Donald sees a paint brush creating a brand-new character, Jos\u00e9 Carioca from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, who shows Donald Duck around South America, lets him have a drink of cacha\u00e7a with him, which is so spicy for Donald that he starts hiccuping, and introduces him to the samba (complete with the songs \"Aquarela do Brasil\" and \"Tico-Tico no Fub\u00e1\"). After that, the film ends.\nCast and characters.\nThe voice cast was all uncredited, as was the practice at the time for many animated films.\nMusic.\nThe film's original score was composed by Edward H. Plumb, Paul J. Smith, and Charles Wolcott. The title song, \"Saludos Amigos\", was written for the film by Charles Wolcott and Ned Washington. The film also featured the song \"Aquarela do Brasil\", written by the popular Brazilian songwriter Ary Barroso and performed by Alo\u00edsio de Oliveira, and an instrumental version of \"Tico-Tico no Fub\u00e1\", written by Zequinha de Abreu. \"Aquarela do Brasil\" was written and first performed in 1939, but did not achieve much initial success. However, after appearing in this film it became an international hit, becoming the first Brazilian song to be played over a million times on American radio.\nThe film's soundtrack was first released by Decca Records in 1944 as a collection of three 78rpm singles.\nRelease.\nTheatrical.\n\"Saludos Amigos\" premiered in Rio de Janeiro on August 24, 1942. It was released in the United States on February 6, 1943. It was theatrically reissued in 1949, when it was shown on a double bill with the first reissue of \"Dumbo\".\nThe film returned rentals to RKO by 1951 of $1,135,000 with $515,000 being generated in the U.S. and Canada.\nHome media.\nIn 1995, the film was released on Laserdisc under the \"Exclusive Archive Collection\" series.\nIt was later released on both VHS and DVD on May 2, 2000 under the Walt Disney Gold Classic Collection banner, and again on DVD on April 29, 2008 under the \"Classic Caballeros Collection\" banner. The film received a third DVD release on November 30, 2010, as a bonus Feature on the \"Walt &amp; El Grupo\" DVD. A fourth release, the first on Blu-ray, was released on January 30, 2018 as \"Saludos Amigos and The Three Caballeros 75th Anniversary Edition 2-Movie Collection)\".\nReception.\nThe film holds an 80% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 15 reviews, with an average score of 6.40/10.

The film premiered in Mexico City on December 21, 1944, and was released in the United States on February 3, 1945. It was later released in the United Kingdom in March 1945. \nThe film celebrates the tenth anniversary of Donald Duck and follows his journey through Latin America, combining live-action with traditional animation. It is the second of the six package films released by Walt Disney Productions during the 1940s, following \"Saludos Amigos\" (1942), and is one of the earliest feature films to blend live-action and animation.\nThe narrative is presented through a series of self-contained segments, linked by the framing device of Donald receiving birthday gifts from his Latin American friends. Featured performers include Aurora Miranda (sister of Carmen Miranda), Dora Luz, and Carmen Molina.\nThe film was developed as part of the studio's contribution to the U.S. Good Neighbor policy toward Latin America during World War II. Donald is joined by returning character Jos\u00e9 Carioca from Brazil and a new companion, the pistol-toting rooster Panchito Pistoles from Mexico.\nPlot.\nThe film, celebrating Donald Duck's 10th anniversary, consists of seven segments, each connected by a common theme. In the film, it is Donald Duck's birthday (namely Friday the 13th), and he receives three presents from friends in Latin America. The first present is a film projector, which shows him a documentary about birds called . The first segment of the documentary tells the story of Pablo, a penguin seeking the warm weather of Equatorial South America. The next segment details some of the odd birds of Latin America. During this part of the documentary, he learns about the Aracuan Bird, who received his name because of his eccentric song. The documentary then shifts to the perspective of a man narrating a story from his childhood, where he discovers and befriends a donkey with the wings of a condor in Uruguay.\nThe next present is a book given to Donald by Jos\u00e9, a native of Brazil. This book tells of Bahia (spelled \"Ba\u00eda\" in the film), which is one of Brazil's 26 states. Jos\u00e9 shrinks them both down so that they can enter the book. Donald and Jos\u00e9 meet up with several of the locals, who dance a lively samba, and Donald ends up pining for one girl Yaya, the Quindim seller, but fails and gets jealous of another man. After the journey, Donald and Jos\u00e9 leave the book.\nUpon returning, Donald realizes that he is too small to open his third present. Jos\u00e9 shows Donald how to use \"black magic\" to return himself to the proper size. After opening the present, he meets Panchito, a native of Mexico. The trio take the name \"The Three Caballeros\" and have a short celebration. Panchito then presents Donald's next present, a . Panchito tells Donald of the tradition behind the pi\u00f1ata. Jos\u00e9 and Panchito then blindfold Donald, and have him attempt to break open the pi\u00f1ata, eventually revealing many surprises. The celebration draws to a close when Donald is fired away by firecrackers in the shape of a ferocious toy bull (with which the firecrackers are lit by Jos\u00e9 with his cigar).\nThroughout the film, the Aracuan Bird appears at random moments. He usually taunts everyone with his madcap antics, sometimes stealing Jos\u00e9's cigar and trying to make Jos\u00e9 jealous. His most famous gag is when he re-routes a train that Donald and Jos\u00e9 are riding on by drawing new tracks, causing the train to disassemble.\nThe film consists of seven segments:\n\"The Cold-Blooded Penguin\".\nThis segment is narrated by Sterling Holloway, reproducing images of the penguins of in Antarctica. In the segment, a penguin named Pablo is so fed up with the freezing conditions of the South Pole that he decides to leave his home for warmer climates, navigating the long coast of Chile (including the Juan Fern\u00e1ndez Islands and Vi\u00f1a del Mar), passing by Lima (the capital of Peru) and Quito (the capital of Ecuador) before landing on the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands.\n\"The Flying Gauchito\".\nThis segment, with adult narration provided by Fred Shields, involves the adventures of a little boy from Uruguay and a winged donkey, who goes by the name of Burrito (which is Spanish for \"little donkey\").\n\"Ba\u00eda\".\nThis segment involves a pop-up book trip through the Brazilian state of Bahia (spelled Ba\u00eda in the film), as Donald and Jos\u00e9 meet up with some of the locals who dance a samba and Donald pining for one of the women, a Quindim seller named Yaya (portrayed by singer Aurora Miranda), who later gives Donald a kiss after he gives her a bouquet of flowers.\n\"Las Posadas\".\nThis is the story of a group of Mexican children who celebrated Christmas by re-enacting the journey of Mary, the mother of Jesus and Saint Joseph searching for room at the inn. meant \"inn\", or \"shelter\", and their parents told them \"no \" at each house until they came to one where they were offered shelter in a stable. This leads to festivities including the breaking of the , which in turn leads to Donald Duck trying to break his \"own\" as well.\n\"Mexico: P\u00e1tzcuaro, Veracruz and Acapulco\".\nPanchito gives Donald and Jos\u00e9 a tour of Mexico City and the country of Mexico on a flying sarape, or magic carpet. Several Mexican dances and songs are learned here. Later Donald pines for more women, tries to pursue every one he sees and gain return affections, but once more he fails every time and ends up kissing Jos\u00e9 while blindfolded.\n\"You Belong to My Heart\" and \"Donald's Surreal Reverie\".\nThe skies of Mexico City result in Donald falling in love with singer Dora Luz. The lyrics in the song itself play parts in the scenarios as well. Then several imagined kisses lead to Donald going into the \"Love is a drug\" scene. Donald constantly envisions sugar rush colors, flowers, and Panchito and Jos\u00e9 popping in at the worst moments, making chaos. The scene changes after Donald manages to dance with Carmen Molina from the state of Oaxaca, from the Isthmus of Tehuantepec. The two dance and sing the song . Carmen begins by singing the song, with Donald \"quacking\" out the rest of the chorus with her. The \"drunkenness\" slows down for a second after Donald multiplies himself while spinning in a circle, but speeds up again when Carmen reappears dressed in a Charro's outfit and uses a horsewhip as a conductor's baton to make cacti appear in many different forms while dancing to , a trademark song of the Mexican Revolution. This scene is notable for providing the masterful combination of live-action and cartoon animation, as well as animation among the cacti.\nThe scene is interrupted when Panchito and Jos\u00e9 suddenly spice things up for the finale of the film, and Donald ends up battling the same toy bull with wheels on its legs the day before from earlier. The catch is that it is now loaded with fireworks and other explosives, following with a fireworks finale with the words \"The End\" exploding from the fireworks, first in Spanish (), in the colors of the flag of Mexico, then the second in Portuguese (), in the colors of the flag of Brazil, and finally in English, in the colors of the flag of the United States (\"The End\").\nBackground.\nThe Good Neighbor policy was a campaign by the United States to improve its relations with Latin America. A special concern in the late 1930s was the mounting program of Nazi propaganda designed to increase Nazism in the Americas, which would weaken US control and divide the Americas. To counter the Nazis, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt founded in 1940\u20131941 the Office of the Coordinator of Inter-American Affairs through which US propaganda efforts could be coordinated. Chief Coordinator Nelson Rockefeller asked Walt Disney to produce a few short films with themes friendly to Latin America, and Disney traveled to Brazil with a creative team to collect images and inspire ideas for such films.\nThe first Disney product of this propaganda program was the animated film \"Saludos Amigos\" in 1942. This film introduced the character Jos\u00e9 Carioca\u2014a Brazilian businessman taking the form of a parrot\u2014who led Donald Duck around South America. The next major film was \"The Three Caballeros\" which brought together Donald Duck, Jos\u00e9 Carioca, and a new character from Mexico: Panchito Pistoles, a gun-toting revolutionary rooster. These Disney films were much more successful than previous propaganda efforts.\nRelease.\nTheatrical.\nThe film's world premiere took place in Mexico City on December 21, 1944. It was released in the United States on February 3, 1945, and in the United Kingdom in March of that year.\n\"The Three Caballeros\" was re-released in theaters on April 15, 1977. For this re-issue, the film was edited significantly and re-released in featurette form at 41 minutes, to accompany a re-issue of \"Never a Dull Moment\".\nTelevision.\nFor the film's television premiere, \"The Three Caballeros\" aired as the ninth episode of the first season of ABC's \"Disneyland\" television series. Edited, shortened, and re-titled \"A Present for Donald\" for this December 22, 1954, broadcast and subsequent re-runs, Donald receives gifts from his friends for Christmas, instead of for his birthday as in the original.\nBox office.\nThe film returned rentals to RKO by 1951 of $3,355,000 with $1,595,000 being generated in the U.S. and Canada. The film generated in excess of $700,000 in Mexico.\nCritical reception.\n\"The Three Caballeros\" received mixed reviews upon its original release. Most critics were relatively perplexed by the \"technological razzle-dazzle\" of the film, thinking that, in contrast to the previous feature films up to this time, \"it displayed more flash than substance, more technique than artistry.\" Bosley Crowther for one wrote in \"The New York Times\", \"Dizzy Disney and his playmates have let their technical talents run wild.\" Other reviewers were taken aback by the sexual dynamics of the film, particularly the idea of Donald Duck lusting towards flesh-and-blood women. As Wolcott Gibbs put it in a negative review of the film for \"The New Yorker\", such a concept \"is one of those things that might disconcert less squeamish authorities than the Hays office. It might even be said that a sequence involving the duck, the young lady, and a long alley of animated cactus plants would probably be considered suggestive in a less innocent medium.\"\nThe film holds an 84% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 19 reviews, with an average score of 6.50/10. The site's consensus reads, \"One of Disney's more abstract creations, \"The Three Caballeros\" is a dazzling, colorful picture that shows the company at an artistic acme.\"\nMusic.\nThe film's original score was composed by Edward H. Plumb, Paul J. Smith, and Charles Wolcott.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The plot concerns an aging outlaw gang on the Mexico\u2013United States border trying to adapt to the changing modern world of 1913. The film was controversial because of its graphic violence and its portrayal of crude men attempting to survive by any available means.\nThe screenplay was co-written by Peckinpah, Walon Green, and Roy N. Sickner. \"The Wild Bunch\" was filmed in Technicolor and Panavision, in Mexico, notably at the Hacienda Ci\u00e9naga del Carmen, deep in the desert between Torre\u00f3n and Saltillo, Coahuila, and on the Nazas River.\n\"The Wild Bunch\" is noted for intricate, multi-angle, quick-cut editing using normal and slow motion images, a revolutionary cinema technique in 1969. The writing of Green, Peckinpah, and Sickner was nominated for a best screenplay Oscar, and the music by Jerry Fielding was nominated for Best Original Score. Additionally, Peckinpah was nominated for an Outstanding Directorial Achievement award by the Directors Guild of America, and cinematographer Lucien Ballard won the National Society of Film Critics Award for Best Cinematography.\nRegarded as one of the greatest films of all time, \"The Wild Bunch\" was selected by the Library of Congress in 1999 for preservation in the United States National Film Registry as \"culturally, historically or aesthetically significant\". The film is ranked 79th on the American Film Institute's list of the 100 best American films and the 69th most thrilling film. In 2008, the AFI listed 10 best films in 10 genres and ranked \"The Wild Bunch\" as the sixth-best Western.\nPlot.\nIn 1913 Texas, Pike Bishop, the leader of a gang of aging outlaws, seeks to retire after a final robbery of silver from a railroad payroll office. Corrupt railroad agent Pat Harrigan has hired a posse of bounty hunters led by Pike's former partner Deke Thornton, who ambush and kill more than half of Bishop's gang in a bloody shootout, which also kills many innocent bystanders as Pike uses a serendipitous temperance union parade to shield their getaway.\nPike rides off with the only survivors: his close friend Dutch Engstrom, brothers Lyle and Tector Gorch, the inexperienced Angel, and a fifth man blinded and mortally wounded by buckshot, whom Pike mercy-kills. The loot from the robbery turns out to be worthless steel washers planted by Harrigan. Needing money, they head for Mexico accompanied by the cantankerous Freddie Sykes and cross the Rio Grande to the rural village where Angel was born. The village elder warns them about General Mapache, a vicious Huertista officer in the Mexican Federal Army, who has been stealing food and animals from local villages to support his campaign against the forces of Pancho Villa.\nPike's gang ask the general for work at his headquarters in the town of Agua Verde. Angel spots his former lover Teresa in Mapache's arms and shoots her dead, angering the general and nearly getting them killed, but Pike defuses the situation. Mapache offers gold to the gang to rob a U.S. Army train so Mapache can resupply his army's dwindling stocks of ammunition and provide samples of American weapons to his German military adviser Commander Mohr.\nAngel gives his share of the gold to Pike in return for sending one crate of rifles and ammunition to a band of peasant rebels opposed to Mapache. The holdup goes largely as planned until Thornton's posse turns up on the train the gang has robbed and chases them to the Mexican border. The robbers blow up a trestle bridge spanning the Rio Grande as the posse tries to cross, dumping the entire posse into the river, but the exhausted posse continues their pursuit.\nPike, anticipating that Mapache might double-cross him, hides the goods and has his men sell them to Mapache in separate amounts. However, Mapache learns from Teresa's mother that Angel stole some of the weapons and reveals this as Angel and Dutch deliver the last of the weapons. Angel desperately tries to escape, only to be captured and beaten. Mapache lets Dutch go after he states that Angel is a thief who deserves to be punished, and Dutch then tells Pike and the others what happened.\nSykes is wounded by Thornton's posse while securing spare horses. Dutch criticizes Thornton for working with the railroad, but Pike says Thornton \"gave his word\" to the railroad and must see it through. Dutch angrily declares, \"That ain't what counts, it's who you give it to.\" Pike and the gang bury most of the gold and return to Agua Verde, where the townspeople and soldiers are drunkenly celebrating the weapons sale and Mapache is dragging Angel through town on a rope tied to the back of his car. Mapache refuses to sell Angel back to the gang, and after a period of reflection while visiting a brothel, Pike and the others arm themselves to rescue their friend by force.\nMapache initially agrees to release Angel, only to cut his throat at the last second. The gang instantly opens fire and guns down the general. While the nearby soldiers are frozen in shock, Pike calmly takes aim and kills Mohr. This begins a bloody gunfight that kills Pike, Dutch, the Gorch Brothers, Mohr's aide, every member of Mapache's staff, and most of the assembled troops.\nThornton arrives and finds Pike already dead. Thornton finds a loaded revolver on Pike's belt and takes it as a sign that the days of men like him are over. Feeling outdated and tired, Thornton allows the remaining posse members to greedily strip Pike and his men of their possessions before taking them back to Texas for the bounty, while he stays behind. After some time, Sykes arrives with the elder from Angel's village and a band of rebels, indicating that they caught up with the bounty hunters, avenged the gang's deaths, and buried them properly. Sykes invites Thornton to join the coming revolution against the Mexican government. Thornton smiles and rides off with them.\nCast.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;* William Holden as Pike Bishop\nProduction.\nDevelopment.\nIn April 1965, producer Reno Carrell optioned an original story and screenplay by Walon Green and Roy Sickner, called \"The Wild Bunch\".\nIn 1967, Warner Bros.-Seven Arts producers Kenneth Hyman and Phil Feldman were interested in having Sam Peckinpah rewrite and direct an adventure film called \"The Diamond Story\". A professional outcast due to the production difficulties of his previous film, \"Major Dundee\" (1965), and his firing from the set of \"The Cincinnati Kid\" (1965), Peckinpah's stock had improved following his critically acclaimed work on the television film \"Noon Wine\" (1966).\nAt the time, William Goldman's screenplay for \"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid\" had recently been purchased by 20th Century Fox. An alternative screenplay available at the studio was \"The Wild Bunch\". It was quickly decided that \"The Wild Bunch\", which had several similarities to Goldman's work, would be produced to beat \"Butch Cassidy\" to the theaters.\nWriting.\nBy the fall of 1967, Peckinpah was rewriting the screenplay and preparing for production. The principal photography was shot entirely on location in Mexico, most notably at the Hacienda Ci\u00e9nega del Carmen (deep in the desert between Torre\u00f3n and Saltillo, Coahuila) and on the Nazas River. Peckinpah's epic work was inspired by his hunger to return to films, the violence seen in Arthur Penn's \"Bonnie and Clyde\" (1967), America's growing frustration with the Vietnam War, and what he perceived to be the utter lack of reality seen in Westerns up to that time.\nHe set out to make a film which portrayed not only the vicious violence of the period, but also the crude men attempting to survive the era. Multiple scenes attempted in \"Major Dundee\", including slow motion action sequences (inspired by Akira Kurosawa's work in \"Seven Samurai\" (1954), characters leaving a village as if in a funeral procession, and the use of inexperienced locals as extras, would become fully realized in \"The Wild Bunch\".\nCasting.\nPeckinpah considered many actors for the Pike Bishop role before casting William Holden, including Richard Boone, Sterling Hayden, Charlton Heston, Burt Lancaster, Lee Marvin, Robert Mitchum, Gregory Peck, and James Stewart. Marvin actually accepted the role but pulled out after he was offered more money to star in \"Paint Your Wagon\" (1969).\nPeckinpah's first two choices for the role of Deke Thornton were Richard Harris (who had co-starred in \"Major Dundee\") and Brian Keith (who had worked with Peckinpah on \"The Westerner\" (1960) and \"The Deadly Companions\" (1961)). Harris was never formally approached; Keith was asked, but he turned it down. Robert Ryan was ultimately cast in the part after Peckinpah saw him in the World War II action movie \"The Dirty Dozen\" (1967). Other actors considered for the role were Henry Fonda, Glenn Ford, Van Heflin, Ben Johnson (later cast as Tector Gorch), and Arthur Kennedy.\nAmong those considered to play Dutch Engstrom were Charles Bronson, Jim Brown, Alex Cord, Robert Culp, Sammy Davis Jr., Richard Jaeckel, Steve McQueen, and George Peppard. Ernest Borgnine was cast based on his performance in \"The Dirty Dozen\" (1967). Robert Blake was the original choice to play Angel, but he asked for too much money. Peckinpah was impressed with Jaime S\u00e1nchez in Sidney Lumet's film adaptation of \"The Pawnbroker\" and demanded that he be cast as Angel.\nThe role of Mapache went to Emilio Fern\u00e1ndez, the Mexican film director, writer, actor, and friend of Peckinpah. Peckinpah first offered the part to German actor Mario Adorf, who had appeared in \"Major Dundee\", but he turned it down due to his discomfort playing such a violent character, a decision he regretted after seeing the finished film.\nStage actor Albert Dekker was cast as Harrigan the railroad detective. \"The Wild Bunch\" was his last film, as he died just months after its final scenes were completed. Bo Hopkins had only a few television credits on his resume when he played the part of Clarence \"Crazy\" Lee. Warren Oates played Lyle Gorch, having previously worked with Peckinpah on the TV series \"The Rifleman\" and his previous films \"Ride the High Country\" (1962) and \"Major Dundee\" (1965).\nFilming.\nThe film was shot with the anamorphic process. Peckinpah and his cinematographer, Lucien Ballard, also made use of telephoto lenses, that allowed for objects and people in both the background and foreground to be compressed in perspective. The effect is best seen in the shots where the Bunch makes the walk to Mapache's headquarters to free Angel. As they walk forward, a constant flow of people passes between them and the camera; most of the people in the foreground are as sharply focused as the Bunch.\nBy the time filming wrapped, Peckinpah had shot of film with 1,288 camera setups. Lombardo and Peckinpah remained in Mexico for six months editing the picture. After initial cuts, the opening gunfight sequence ran 21 minutes. By cutting frames from specific scenes and intercutting others, they were able to fine-cut the opening robbery down to five minutes. The creative montage became the model for the rest of the film and would \"forever change the way movies would be made\".\nPeckinpah stated that one of his goals for the movie was to give the audience \"some idea of what it is to be gunned down\". A memorable incident occurred, to that end, as Peckinpah's crew were consulting him on the \"gunfire\" effects to be used in the film. Not satisfied with the results from the squibs his crew had brought for him, Peckinpah became exasperated and finally hollered: \"That's not what I want! \"That's not what I want!\"\" He then grabbed a real revolver and fired it into a nearby wall. The gun empty, Peckinpah barked at his stunned crew: \"THAT'S the effect I want!!\"\nHe also had the gunfire sound effects changed for the film. Before, all gunshots in Warner Bros. movies sounded identical, regardless of the type of weapon being fired. Peckinpah insisted that each different type of firearm have its own specific sound effect when fired.\nEditing.\nThe editing of the film is notable in that shots from multiple angles were spliced together in rapid succession, often at different speeds, placing greater emphasis on the chaotic nature of the action and the gunfights.\nLou Lombardo, having previously worked with Peckinpah on \"Noon Wine\", was personally hired by the director to edit \"The Wild Bunch\". Peckinpah had wanted an editor who would be loyal to him. Lombardo's youth was also a plus, as he was not bound by traditional conventions.\nOne of Lombardo's first contributions was to show Peckinpah an episode of the TV series \"Felony Squad\" he had edited in 1967. The episode, entitled \"My Mommy Got Lost\", included a slow motion sequence where Joe Don Baker is shot by the police. The scene mixed slow motion with normal speed, having been filmed at 24 frames per second, but triple printed optically at 72 frames per second. Peckinpah was reportedly thrilled and told Lombardo: \"Let's try some of that when we get down to Mexico!\" The director would film the major shootouts with six cameras, operating at various film rates, including 24 frames per second, 30 frames per second, 60 frames per second, 90 frames per second, and 120 frames per second. When the scenes were eventually cut together, the action would shift from slow to fast to slower still, giving time an elastic quality never before seen in motion pictures up to that time.\nFurther editing was done to secure a favorable rating from the MPAA, which was in the process of establishing a new set of codes. Peckinpah and his editors cut the film to satisfy the new, expansive R-rating parameters which, for the first time, designated a film as being unsuitable for children. Without this new system in place, the film could not have been released with its explicit images of bloodshed.\nThemes.\nCritics of \"The Wild Bunch\" note the theme of the end of the outlaw gunfighter era. For example, the character Pike Bishop advises: \"We've got to start thinking beyond our guns. Those days are closing fast.\" The Bunch lives by an anachronistic code of honor that is out of place in 20th-century society. Also, when the gang inspects Mapache's new automobile, they perceive it marks the end of horse travel, a symbol also in Peckinpah's \"Ride the High Country\" (1962) and \"The Ballad of Cable Hogue\" (1970).\nThe violence that was much criticized in 1969 remains controversial. Peckinpah noted it was allegoric of the American war in Vietnam, the violence of which was nightly televised to American homes at supper time. He tried showing the gun violence commonplace to the historic western frontier period, rebelling against sanitized, bloodless television Westerns and films glamorizing gunfights and murder: \"The point of the film is to take this fa\u00e7ade of movie violence and open it up, get people involved in it so that they are starting to go in the Hollywood television predictable reaction syndrome, and then twist it so that it's not fun anymore, just a wave of sickness in the gut ... it's ugly, brutalizing, and bloody awful; it's not fun and games and cowboys and Indians. It's a terrible, ugly thing, and yet there's a certain response that you get from it, an excitement, because we're all violent people.\" Peckinpah used violence as a catharsis, believing his audience would be purged of violence by witnessing it explicitly on screen. He later admitted to being mistaken, observing that the audience came to enjoy rather than be horrified by his films' violence, which troubled him.\nBetrayal is the secondary theme of \"The Wild Bunch\". The characters suffer from their knowledge of having betrayed a friend and left him to his fate, thus violating their own honor code when it suits them (\"$10,000 cuts an awful lot of family ties\"). However, Bishop says, \"When you side with a man, you stay with him, and if you can't do that you're like some animal.\" Such oppositional ideas lead to the film's violent conclusion, as the remaining men find their abandonment of Angel intolerable. Bishop remembers his betrayals, most notably when he deserts Deke Thornton, in flashback, when the law catches up to them and when he abandons Crazy Lee at the railroad office after the robbery, ostensibly to guard the hostages. Critic David Weddle writes that \"like that of Conrad's \"Lord Jim\", Pike Bishop's heroism is propelled by overwhelming guilt and a despairing death wish.\"\nRelease.\nTheatrical release.\nThe film opened on June 18, 1969, at the Pix theatre in Los Angeles and grossed $39,200 in its first week. Produced on a budget of $6\u00a0million, the film grossed $10.5\u00a0million at the US box office in 1970 and another $638,641 in the US on its 1995 restored box-office release, making a total of $11,138,641. It was the 17th highest-grossing film of 1969.\nVersions.\nThere have been several versions of the film:\nIn 1993, Warner Bros. resubmitted the film to the MPAA ratings board prior to an expected re-release. To the studio's surprise, the originally R-rated film was re-rated NC-17, which delayed the release until the decision was appealed. The controversy was linked to 10 extra minutes added to the film, although none of this footage contained graphic violence. Warner Bros. trimmed some footage to decrease the running time to ensure additional daily screenings. When the restored film finally made it to the screen in March 1995, one reviewer noted:\nBy restoring 10 minutes to the film, the complex story now fits together in a seamless way, filling in those gaps found in the previous theatrical release, and proving that Peckinpah was firing on all cylinders for this, his grandest achievement. ... And the one overwhelming feature that the director's cut makes unforgettable are the many faces of the children, whether playing, singing, or cowering, much of the reaction to what happens on-screen is through the eyes, both innocent and imitative, of all the children.\nAlmost all of the versions of the film include the missing scenes. Warner Bros. released a newly restored version in a two-disc special edition on January 10, 2006. It includes an audio commentary by Peckinpah scholars, two documentaries concerning the making of the film (one of them is the Oscar-nominated \"\"), and never-before-seen outtakes.\nReception.\nCritical reception.\nCritical reaction in New York was mixed, with four reviewers with favorable reviews and three with unfavorable opinions, although there was debate as to whether the \"New York Post\"'s Archer Winsten's review was mostly favorable despite asking \"was this violence necessary?\". Vincent Canby began his review in \"The New York Times\" by calling the film \"very beautiful and the first truly interesting American-made Western in years. It's also so full of violence\u2014of an intensity that can hardly be supported by the story\u2014that it's going to prompt a lot of people who do not know the real effect of movie violence (as I do not) to write automatic condemnations of it.\" He observed, \"Although the movie's conventional and poetic action sequences are extraordinarily good and its landscapes beautifully photographed ... it is most interesting in its almost jolly account of chaos, corruption, and defeat\". About the actors, he commented particularly on William Holden: \"After years of giving bored performances in boring movies, Holden comes back gallantly in \"The Wild Bunch\". He looks older and tired, but he has style, both as a man and as a movie character who persists in doing what he's always done, not because he really wants the money but because there's simply nothing else to do.\"\nCritic Pauline Kael wrote that it was a \"traumatic poem of violence with imagery as ambivalent as Goya's.\" \n\"Time\" also liked Holden's performance, describing it as his best since \"Stalag 17\" (a 1953 film that earned Holden an Oscar), noting Robert Ryan gave \"the screen performance of his career\", and concluding that \"\"The Wild Bunch\" contains faults and mistakes\" (such as flashbacks \"introduced with surprising clumsiness\"), but \"its accomplishments are more than sufficient to confirm that Peckinpah, along with Stanley Kubrick and Arthur Penn, belongs with the best of the newer generation of American filmmakers.\"\nWilliam Wolf for \"Cue\" magazine found no merit in the film and gave it a two sentence dismissal and Judith Crist of \"New York\" magazine was also negative about the film.\nIn a 2002 retrospective Roger Ebert, who \"saw the original version at the world premiere in 1969, during the golden age of the junket, when Warner Bros. screened five of its new films in the Bahamas for 450 critics and reporters\", said that, back then, he had publicly declared the film a masterpiece during the junket's press conference, prompted by comments from \"a reporter from the \"Reader's Digest\" [who] got up to ask 'Why was this film ever made?'\" He compared the film to \"Pulp Fiction\": \"praised and condemned with equal vehemence.\"\n\"What \"Citizen Kane\" was to movie lovers in 1941, \"The Wild Bunch\" was to cineastes in 1969,\" wrote film critic Michael Sragow, who added that Peckinpah had \"produced an American movie that equals or surpasses the best of Kurosawa: the Gotterdammerung of Westerns\".\nOn Rotten Tomatoes the film has a 91% rating with an average rating of 8.8/10 based on reviews from 66 critics with its consensus stating, \"\"The Wild Bunch\" is Sam Peckinpah's shocking, violent ballad to an old world and a dying genre\".\n\"The Wild Bunch\" was cited as cinematographer Roger Deakins's favorite film, and film director Kathryn Bigelow named it as one of her five favorite films. In the 2012 BFI \"Sight &amp; Sound\" poll for The Greatest Films of All Time, \"The Wild Bunch\" received 27 votes from critics and directors such as Michael Mann, Paul Schrader and Edgar Wright.\nLegacy.\nDecades later, the American Film Institute placed the film in several of its \"100 Years\" lists:\nIn 1999, \"The Wild Bunch\" was selected for preservation by the Library of Congress in the United States National Film Registry as being \"culturally, historically or aesthetically significant\".\nIn 2008, the film was ranked #94 on \"Empire\" magazine's list of \"The 500 Greatest Movies of All Time\". It was later ranked #254 (out of 301 films) on their revised list in 2014. In the 2012 BFI \"Sight &amp; Sound\" poll of The Greatest Films of All Time, \"The Wild Bunch\" ranked 84th on the critics' poll and 75th on the directors' poll. In 2005, the \"Los Angeles Times\" included \"The Wild Bunch\" on their list of \"The 129 Best Films of All Time\", compiled by film critic Peter Rainer.\nIn 2006, the script for the film was selected by the Writers Guild of America as one of the 101 best screenplays of all time. \"The Wild Bunch\" is also ranked as the 63rd best-directed film of all time by the Directors Guild of America. In 2012, the Motion Picture Editors Guild listed \"The Wild Bunch\" as the 23rd best-edited film of all time based on a survey of its membership.\nIn 1999, \"Entertainment Weekly\" ranked \"The Wild Bunch\" 57th on their list of the 100 greatest movies of all time. It was later ranked 83rd on their revised list in 2013. The National Society of Film Critics also included \"The Wild Bunch\" on their list of \"100 Essential Films\".\nIn 2016, \"Business Insider\" assembled a list of the 50 best movies of all time, according to film critics on the review aggregation website Metacritic. \"The Wild Bunch\" ranked #25. \"Time Out's\" Film Guide ranked the film #29 on their list of the 100 greatest movies as polled by their readers.\nFilm critic and scholar Steven J. Schneider included the film in his book of \"1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die\".\nIn 2003, \"The New York Times\" ranked the film as one of \"The 1000 Best Movies Ever Made\". In 2022, \"Variety\" magazine ranked the film #41 on their list of \"The 100 Greatest Movies of All Time\".\nFilmSite.org, a subsidiary of American Movie Classics, included the film on their list of the 100 greatest films. Additionally, Films101.com ranked \"The Wild Bunch\" as the 75th best of all time.\nDocumentary.\nSam Peckinpah and the making of \"The Wild Bunch\" were the subjects of the documentary \"\" (1996) directed and edited by Paul Seydor. The documentary was occasioned by the discovery of 72 minutes of silent, black-and-white film footage of Peckinpah and company on location in northern Mexico during the filming of \"The Wild Bunch\". Michael Sragow wrote in 2000 that the documentary was \"a wonderful introduction to Peckinpah's radically detailed historical film about American outlaws in revolutionary Mexico\u2014a masterpiece that's part bullet-driven ballet, part requiem for Old West friendship and part existential explosion. Seydor's movie is also a poetic flight on the myriad possibilities of movie directing.\" Seydor and his co-producer Nick Redman were nominated in 1997 for the Academy Award for Best Documentary (Short Subject).\nRemake.\nIn 2005, David Ayer was reported to be in final negotiations to direct and write a remake of \"The Wild Bunch\". Jerry Weintraub would produce and Mark Vahradian would executive produce. The remake would be a modern reinterpretation of the original, involving heists, drug cartels and the CIA.\nOn January 19, 2011, it was announced by Warner Bros. that a remake of \"The Wild Bunch\" was in the works. Screenwriter Brian Helgeland was hired to develop a new script. The 2012 suicide of Tony Scott, who was scheduled to direct, put the project in limbo.\nOn May 15, 2013, \"The Wrap\" reported that Will Smith was in talks to star in and produce the remake. The new version would involve drug cartels and follows a disgraced DEA agent who assembles a team to go after a Mexican drug lord and his fortune. No director has been chosen, and a new screenwriter is being sought.\nIn 2015, a Hollywood insider website announced that Jonathan Jakubowicz was set to write and direct a remake. \"Our sources also tell us that the remake will update the story to a contemporary setting, revolving around the CIA, dangerous drug cartels, and a thrilling heist against the backdrop of the Southern California-Mexico border. Jakubowicz will be working from previous drafts submitted by David Ayer and Brian Helgeland.\"\nIn 2018, it was announced that Mel Gibson would co-write and direct a new version of \"The Wild Bunch\".\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The film is a satire on popular fan culture, Hollywood hype, and the advertising industry, which was profiting from commercials on the relatively new medium of television. It also takes aim at the reduction television caused to the size of movie theater audiences in the 1950s. The film was known as Oh! For a Man! in the United Kingdom.\nThe film was produced and directed by Frank Tashlin, who also wrote the largely original screenplay, using little more than the title and the character of Rita Marlowe from the successful Broadway play \"Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter?\" by George Axelrod. The play had run from 1955 to 1956 and also starred Jayne Mansfield as Rita.\nPlot.\nStruggling writer Rockwell P. Hunter is low rung of the ladder at the La Salle advertising agency. With the agency set to lose its biggest account \u2014 Stay-Put Lipstick \u2014 he hatches an idea to get the perfect model and spokeswoman for Stay-Put's new line of lipstick: famous actress Rita Marlowe. Fortunately, his teenage niece April \u2014 a huge fan of Rita \u2014 knows where Rita is staying in New York.\nFor Rita to endorse the lipstick, however, Rock has to act as her boyfriend to make her real boyfriend, TV actor Bobo Branigansky, jealous. Bobo leaks the news of Rita's new romance in a TV interview and Rock is suddenly famous as her \"Lover Doll\".\nRock's boss decides to leverage his employee's newfound fame, but when Rock gets Rita to agree on a television special sponsored by Stay-Put, Rock becomes the agency's highest-regarded employee. The two agree to continue this mutually beneficial relationship, garnering media attention for Rita and business for Rock. Rita, meanwhile, is miserable, as she is not over her one real true love, George Schmidlap, the man who discovered her. Unable to find Schmidlap, she pursues Rock, though her secretary Vi warns her that she is playing a dangerous game. Meanwhile, Rock's angry fianc\u00e9e Jenny is jealous, and in a bid to get back his attention, starts dressing and talking like Rita, much to Rock's frustration.\nRock soon realizes that fame is a double-edged sword; it brings him what he desires, but at a cost. While women admire him, he struggles to find peace of mind. In the end, he climbs the corporate ladder and becomes the company president, only to realize that it is not what he truly wanted. Rock tells Jenny that achieving this success has left him feeling empty, and she decides to take him back.\nAs Rita opens her television special for Stay-Put, she is surprised by the appearance of the show's guest star (her one true love), George Schmidlap. The two kiss and reunite.\nFreed from the strain of advertising, Rock and Jenny retire to the country to tend a chicken farm, announcing that he has found the real \"living end\".\nProduction.\n\"Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter?\" received a nomination for a Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture Actor \u2013 Musical/Comedy (Tony Randall) and a nomination for the Writers Guild of America, East WGA Award (Screen) for Best Written American Comedy (Frank Tashlin). Initially, Tashlin envisioned Ed Sullivan for the role of Rockwell P. Hunter. Sullivan turned it down, so Tony Randall was awarded the part.\nThe film contains joking references to several of Mansfield's other roles, including \"The Girl Can't Help It\" (1956; also directed by Tashlin), \"Kiss Them for Me\" (1957), and \"The Wayward Bus\" (1957). The book Rita Marlowe reads in the bathtub scene is \"Peyton Place\" (1956) by Grace Metalious, which became a feature film and a popular TV series. The buxom characters in the book were claimed to have been inspired by Mansfield. Joan Blondell, who was herself a major movie sex symbol some 30 years before (her sexuality being an early target of the Hays Code), was cast as Mansfield's frumpy, middle-aged, all-business secretary.\nFormer silent film star Minta Durfee has an uncredited role as a scrubwoman.\nRandall is featured at the beginning of the film playing the drums, a trumpet, and a cello during the 20th Century-Fox logo and fanfare sequence. At the end, he remarks, \"Oh, the fine print they put in an actor's contract these days!\" He also performs a comedic intermission midway through the film, which he says is for the audience used to television break.\nIn lieu of a theme song and opening of the film, Tashlin instead laid traditional opening credits over faux television commercials for products that failed to deliver what they promised.\nLegacy.\n\"Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter?\" is known as Mansfield's \"signature film\". In 1966 Frank Tashlin said it was the film of his with which he was \"most satisfied... there was no compromise on that one. Buddy Adler let me do it my own way.\"\nNo less than ten television shows had episodes parodying the title of the film, usually substituting a series' character's name in place of Rock Hunter. Among the series who did so were \"The Munsters\", \"My Three Sons\", and \"The Bullwinkle Show\". https://\nThere is a reference to this film in the film of the 1964 spy novel \"Funeral in Berlin\", starring Michael Caine as Harry Palmer. When the secret agent Palmer gets forged papers with a new identity, he is dissatisfied with the name given to him and complains, \"Rock Hunter! Why can't I be Rock Hunter?\"\nIn 2000, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".\nReception.\nCritical response.\nOn review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, 88% of 24 critics have given the film a positive review. James Powers of The Hollywood Reporter praised the film as \"social satire at its most penetrating\" with a focus on \"the inanities of TV\" and on the mainstream notion of success itself. Powers wrote: \"The joy of Tashlin's parable is so funny that you don't feel the blow until you see the bruise. You are laughing at some very silly people that you do not realize until much later very much resemble you.\" Powers even claimed that the unconventional opening titles \"could stand by themselves as among the funniest sequences ever filmed.\" Picturegoer called the film \"the most savage debunking\" of television to date, claiming Hollywood \"cut its home-screen rival down to size.\" \"Variety\" praised the film and called it one of the funniest films of the year, noting how effective Frank Tashlin's \"one-man band\" approach was to the production: \"Producer Tashlin obviously was determined to shoot the works for director Tashlin who in turn knew how to handle the scripter Tashlin. The magazine favorably noted that Mansfield did \"a sock job\" in the starring role.\nFilm critic Bosley Crowther of \"The New York Times\" criticized Tashlin's script as lacking \"substance and cohesion,\" claiming that the satire failed to prove movie entertainment as superior to television. In his review, Crowther wrote: \"People who live in glass houses should not throw stones at their television sets, no matter how scornful and superior they may feel toward video. The rocks may miss the vexing targets and crash through their own fragile walls. This axiom is clearly demonstrated in the flimsy motion picture that has been made from the flimsy stage play \"Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter?\"\". He also criticized Mansfield's portrayal of Rita Marlowe, a character meant to impersonate Marilyn Monroe, calling the portrayal a \"travesty.\"\nEthan de Seife wrote in his book, \"Tashlinesque: The Hollywood Comedies of Frank Tashlin\", that we see with \"Son of Paleface\", \"Marry Me Again\", \"Artists and Models\", \"Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter?\", \"The Man from the Diners' Club\", \"The Private Navy of Sergeant O'Farrell\", and many others that American animation and American live-action comedy derive from the same tradition. Peter Lev wrote in his book, \"Twentieth Century-Fox: The Zanuck-Skouras Years, 1935\u20131965\", \"\"Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter?\" is more fragmented than \"The Girl Can't Help It\", and paradoxically it makes it a better film.\"\nHome media.\n\"Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter?\" is in a package called \"The Jayne Mansfield Collection\" along with \"The Girl Can't Help It\" (1956) and \"The Sheriff of Fractured Jaw\" (1958)\nThe film was released on VHS on July 2, 1996, by 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment.\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It originally aired in prime time from September 23, 1962, to March 17, 1963, on ABC, then later aired in reruns via syndication, with new episodes produced from 1985 to 1987. It was Hanna-Barbera's Space Age counterpart to \"The Flintstones\".\nWhile the Flintstones lived in a world which was a comical version of the Stone Age, with machines powered by birds and dinosaurs, the Jetsons live in a comical version of the space age, with elaborate robotic contraptions, aliens, holograms, and whimsical inventions.\nThe original had 24 episodes and aired on Sunday nights on ABC beginning on September 23, 1962, with prime time reruns continuing through September 22, 1963. It debuted as the first program broadcast in color on ABC, back in the early 1960s when only a handful of ABC stations were capable of broadcasting in color. In contrast, \"The Flintstones\", while always produced in color, was broadcast in black-and-white for its first two seasons.\nThe show was originally scheduled opposite \"Walt Disney's Wonderful World of Color\" and \"Dennis the Menace\" and did not receive much attention. Due to poor ratings, it was cancelled after its first season but was then moved to Saturday mornings, where it went on to be very successful. Following its primetime run, the show aired on Saturday mornings for decades, starting on ABC for the 1963\u201364 season and then on CBS and NBC. New episodes were produced for syndication from 1985 to 1987. No further specials or episodes of the show were produced after 1989, as the majority of the core cast (George O'Hanlon, Mel Blanc, and Daws Butler) had died in 1988 and 1989. The 1990 film \"\" served as the series finale to the television show, though it failed to achieve critical and commercial success.\nPremise.\nIn the space age, the Jetsons are a family residing in Orbit City. The city's architecture is rendered in the Googie style and all homes and businesses are raised high above the ground on adjustable columns to avoid the pollutions from below. George Jetson lives with his family in the Skypad Apartments: his wife Jane is a homemaker, their teenage daughter Judy attends Orbit High School, and their son Elroy attends Little Dipper School. Housekeeping is performed by a robot maid named Rosie, who handles chores not otherwise rendered trivial by the home's numerous push-button Space Age-envisioned conveniences. The family has a dog named Astro that talks with an initial consonant mutation in which every word begins with an \"R\", as if speaking with a growl; a similar effect would also be used for Scooby-Doo.\nGeorge Jetson's work week consists of an hour a day, two days a week. His boss is Cosmo Spacely, the bombastic owner of Spacely Space Sprockets. Spacely has a competitor, Mr. Cogswell, owner of the rival company Cogswell Cogs (sometimes known as Cogswell's Cosmic Cogs). Jetson commutes to work in an aerocar with a transparent bubble top. Daily life is leisurely, assisted by numerous labor-saving devices, which occasionally break down with humorous results. Despite this, everyone complains of exhausting hard labor and difficulties living with the remaining inconveniences.\nVoice cast.\nIn later productions, Jeff Bergman has voiced George, Elroy, and Mr. Spacely. Bergman completed voice work as George and Spacely for \"\" (1990) after George O'Hanlon and Mel Blanc died during production. Controversially, Janet Waldo was replaced\u2014after recording all of her dialogue\u2014by then-popular singer Tiffany for \"Jetsons: The Movie\". Lauri Fraser has provided the voice of Jane Jetson in television commercials for Radio Shack.\nProduction.\nThe first season for the series was produced and directed by William Hanna and Joseph Barbera. When Warner Bros. Cartoons closed in May 1961, several of its animators, including Gerry Chiniquy and Ken Harris, joined Hanna-Barbera to work on the first season.\nMorey Amsterdam and Pat Carroll controversy.\nIn 1963, Morey Amsterdam and Pat Carroll each filed $12,000 suits against Hanna-Barbera for breach of contract, claiming they had been cast and signed to the roles of George Jetson and Jane Jetson, respectively. Although their contracts stipulated they would be paid US$500 an episode with a guarantee of twenty-four episodes (i.e., a full season) of work, they recorded only one episode before being replaced. Several sources claimed the change had occurred as a result of sponsor conflict between Amsterdam's commitment to \"The Dick Van Dyke Show\" and Carroll's to \"Make Room for Daddy\". The case had been closed by early 1965. In a 2013 interview, Pat Carroll indicated that the court had ruled in favor of Hanna-Barbera.\nEpisodes.\n\"The Jetsons\" original aired at primetime on ABC. It was a commercial failure in its first season and was negatively reviewed according to Bob Hathcock. Reruns were aired on CBS in 1963, and NBC from 1964 to 1967. It was brought back to NBC's schedule in 1971, and ongoing when 41 new episodes were ordered.\nIn 1984, Hanna-Barbera began producing new episodes specifically for syndication; by September 1985, the 24 episodes from the first season were combined with 41 new episodes and began airing in morning or late afternoon time slots in 80 U.S. media markets, including the 30 largest. The 41 new episodes were produced at a cost of $300,000 each, and featured all of the voice actors from the 1962\u20131963 show. During 1987, 10 additional \"season 3\" episodes were also made available for syndication.\nBroadcast history.\nFollowing its prime time cancellation, ABC placed reruns of \"The Jetsons\" on its Saturday morning schedule for the 1963\u20131964 season. The program would spend the next two decades on Saturday mornings, with subsequent runs on CBS (1964\u201365 and 1969\u201371) and NBC (1965\u201367; 1971\u201376; 1979\u201381 and 1982\u201383). \"The Jetsons\" began airing in syndication in September 1976, and these runs continued after the program returned to NBC's Saturday morning schedule. Along with fellow Hanna-Barbera production \"Jonny Quest\" and Warner Bros.' \"Looney Tunes\" shorts, \"The Jetsons\" is one of the few series to have aired on each of the Big Three television networks in the United States.\n\"The Jetsons\" were also aired on MeTV\nTheme song.\nThe series' theme song, by composer Hoyt Curtin, became a pop hit in 1986.\nScience fiction themes.\nAnimation historian Christopher P. Lehman considers that the series shares its main science fiction theme with \"Funderful Suburbia\" (1962), a \"Modern Madcaps\" animated short. Both feature people involved in space colonization. However, there is a key difference in the nature of the colonization: in \"Funderful Suburbia\", humans colonize outer space in order to escape the problems of planet Earth, while the Jetsons live in a place where space colonization is already established. Life in outer space is depicted as a fact of life, and the reasons behind humanity's takeover of outer space are never explained.\nLehman argues that the series offers no explanation for its science fiction premise and does not directly satirize the social problems of any era. The setting is combined with standard sitcom elements, which serve as the series' main focus.\nSmithsonian's Matt Novak, in an article called \"Why The Show Still Matters\" asserts, \"Today \"The Jetsons\" stands as the single most important piece of 20th century futurism.\"\nNovak continues, \"It's easy for some people to dismiss \"The Jetsons\" as just a TV show, and a lowly cartoon at that. But this little show\u2014for better and for worse\u2014has had a profound impact on the way that Americans think and talk about the future.\"\nReception.\nAfter the announcement of the fall 1962 network television schedule \"Time\" magazine characterized \"The Jetsons\" as one of several new situation comedies (along with \"The Beverly Hillbillies\", \"I'm Dickens... He's Fenster\", and \"Our Man Higgins\") that was \"stretching further than ever for their situations\"; after all the season's new shows had premiered\u2014a season \"responding to Minow's exhortations\"\u2014the magazine called the series \"silly and unpretentious, corny and clever, now and then quite funny.\" Almost all of the new sitcoms disappeared at the end of the season; only \"The Beverly Hillbillies\" would be renewed for new episodes in 1963\u201364, while \"The Jetsons\" would continue in Saturday morning reruns, eventually leading to its 1980s revival.\nThirty years later, \"Time\" wrote: \"In an age of working mothers, single parents and gay matrimony (same-sex marriage), George Jetson and his clan already seem quaint even to the baby boomers who grew up with them.\" In contrast, economist Jeffrey A. Tucker wrote in 2011 that \"The Jetsons\" is \"distinguished in science-fiction lore by\nthe fact that it is a rare attempt in this genre that actually succeeds in predicting the future.\" Apart from flying cars, which are as yet unfeasible in the real world (\"a lot of fun, until that first accident occurs\"), much of the technology of \"The Jetsons\" has become commonplace: people now communicate via video chat on flat screens; domestic robots such as the Roomba are widespread, and various high-tech devices are used for leisure. Tucker notes that \"The Jetsons\" depicts neither a grim dystopia nor an idyllic utopia, but rather a world where capitalism and entrepreneurship still exist and technology has not changed fundamental elements of human nature.\nIn 2017, Devon Maloney from \"The Verge\" described the show as a \"bone-chilling dystopia\", stating how a reboot-comic book revealed that an environmental apocalypse caused humans to seek refuge in aerial cities. Maloney also notes the lack of people of color in the show and theorizes how discrimination against impoverished groups and developing countries could've taken place, stating \"though long held up as the quintessential utopia, \"The Jetsons\" is a perfect dystopia, built on the corpses of a billions-strong underclass deemed unworthy of a life in the clouds.\"\nSpecials and film adaptations.\nTelevision films\nTelevision specials\nTheatrical releases\nDirect-to-video films\nProposed continuations and reboots.\nA 1974 proposal would have created a sequel series to \"The Jetsons\", set roughly ten years after the original series. CBS rejected the proposal and it was retooled into \"Partridge Family 2200 A.D.\"\nParamount Pictures first tried to film a live-action version of \"The Jetsons\" in 1985, which was to be executive produced by Gary Nardino, but failed to do so. In the late 1980s, Universal Pictures purchased the film rights for \"The Flintstones\" and \"The Jetsons\" from Hanna-Barbera Productions. The result was \"\", which was released in 1990. In November 2001, screenwriting duo Paul Foley and Dan Forman were brought onboard to revise a screenplay, with Rob Minkoff attached as director and Denise Di Novi as producer.\nOn March 18, 2003, it was announced that the script was again being reworked, with Adam Shankman entering negotiations to direct and co-write the film. In June 2004, with Shankman still onboard as director, Di Novi confirmed that the latest draft was penned by Sam Harper. By May 2006, the project was re-launched with Adam F. Goldberg confirmed as the new screenwriter, and Donald De Line was added as producer alongside Di Novi.\nIn May 2007, director Robert Rodriguez entered talks with Universal Studios and Warner Bros. to film a CGI adaptation of \"The Jetsons\" for a potential 2009 theatrical release, having at the time discussed directing a film adaptation of \"Land of the Lost\" with Universal. Rodriguez was uncertain which project he would pursue next, though the latest script draft for \"The Jetsons\" by Goldberg was further along in development.\nIn January 2012, recording artist Kanye West was mistakenly reported as creative director over the project, though West clarified on social media that \"I was just discussing becoming the creative director for the Jetson [\"sic\"] movie and someone on the call yelled out.. you should do a Jetsons tour!\" Longtime producer Denise Di Novi denied the confirmed involvement stating negotiations with West via conference call was merely \"preliminary and exploratory and introductory\". In February 2012, Warner Bros. hired Van Robichaux and Evan Susser to rewrite the script.\nOn January 23, 2015, it was announced that Warner Bros. is planning a new animated \"Jetsons\" feature film, with Matt Lieberman to provide the screenplay. As of May 25, 2017, Conrad Vernon will direct the film.\nOn August 17, 2017, ABC ordered a pilot for a live-action sitcom version of \"The Jetsons\" to be written by Gary Janetti and executive produced by Janetti, Jack Rapke and Robert Zemeckis.\nOn October 15, 2025, it was reported that a live-action film based on \"The Jetsons\" was in development with Colin Trevorrow to write and direct and Jim Carrey in talks to star.\nFurther appearances.\nHome media.\nIn 1990, Hanna-Barbera Home Video released six episodes from the show on videocassette. Warner Home Video released season 1 on DVD in Region 1 on May 11, 2004; upon its release, James Poniewozik wrote that it is \"as much about New Frontier 1962 as about the distant future. Its ditzy slapstick is like the peanut-butter-and-jelly mix Goober Grape\u2014if you didn't love it as a kid, you're not going to acquire the taste as an adult\u2014and the pop-culture gags ... have not aged well. But the animation is still a classic of gee-whiz atomic-age modernism.\"\nThe review of the DVD release from \"Entertainment Weekly\" said the show \"trots through surprisingly dated sitcom plots about blustery bosses, bad lady drivers, and Elvis Presleyesque teen idols, all greeted with laugh tracks\" but points out \"it's the appeal of the retro-prescient gadgets (recliner massagers, big-screen TVs, two-way monitors) that still carries the show.\" Season 1 was released on DVD in Region 4 on July 5, 2006. Season Two, Volume 1 was released on DVD almost three years later, on June 2, 2009, for Region 1.\nOn November 8, 2011, Warner Home Video (via the Warner Archive Collection) released \"The Jetsons: Season 2, Volume 2\" on DVD in Region 1 as part of their Hanna-Barbera Classic Collection. This is a Manufacture-on-Demand (MOD) release, available exclusively through Warner's online store and Amazon.com. Warner Archive followed up by releasing Season 3 in the same way on May 13, 2014.\nThe complete ABC series was released on Blu-ray on September 10, 2019, by Warner Home Video (again via the Warner Archive Collection), sourced from new 2K scans of the original broadcast masters while maintaining the show's original aspect ratio.\nLegacy.\nWilliam S Higgins writing for \"The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction\" noted that the show \"has become a popular metonym for 'the future'. While satirizing Space Age notions of a better tomorrow, the series seems also to have visually codified expectations of the future to a great many viewers: when the twenty-first century arrived, complaints that flying cars and jet packs were missing often mentioned \"The Jetsons\".\".\nThe show influenced the turn-of-the-millennium show \"Futurama\", which made a number of references to \"The Jetsons\", or reused its tropes.\nBoomerang has aired reruns of the show since April 1, 2000. Cartoon Network aired the show from 1992 to 2004 and returned the series October 2012. Also, some of the 1980s episodes were available for viewing on In2TV prior to its shutdown; these episodes were later moved to the online version of Kids' WB. Also the first two seasons of \"The Jetsons\" are available to download on Sony's PlayStation Network, Apple's iTunes Store and at the Xbox Live Marketplace. The Kids' WB website eventually shut down in 2015, however, the Kids' WB episodes can still be streamed, thanks to much of the website being preserved by the Internet Archive's Wayback Machine.\n\"Forbes\" magazine valued Spacely Sprockets at $1.3 billion, on its \"The 25 Largest Fictional Companies\" list.\nThe original cartoon series had several devices that did not exist at the time but subsequently have not only been invented but are in common usage: a flatscreen television, newspaper on a computer-like screen, a computer virus, video chat, a tanning bed, home treadmill and more.\nIn January 2009, IGN listed \"The Jetsons\" as the 46th best animated television series.\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

While the film has no audible dialog, it was released with a synchronized musical score with sound effects using both the sound-on-disc and sound-on-film process. The movie was adapted by Frances Marion from the 1925 novel of the same name written by Dorothy Scarborough. Featuring Lillian Gish, Lars Hanson and Montagu Love, it is one of the last films released by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer without audible dialogue and is considered to be among the greatest \"silent\" films.\nThe film entered the public domain in the United States in 2024.\nPlot.\nAn impoverished young woman named Letty Mason travels west by train from Virginia to live at her cousin Beverly's isolated ranch in Sweetwater, Texas. On the way, she is bothered by the constantly blowing wind. Fellow passenger and cattle buyer Wirt Roddy makes her acquaintance and tells her the wind usually drives women crazy.\nUpon arrival, she is picked up by Beverly's closest neighbors, Lige Hightower and the older, balding Sourdough, who live 15 miles from her cousin. Wirt assures her he will drop by occasionally to see how she is doing.\nAfter endless miles in sand and wind, they arrive at the ranch. Beverly is delighted to see her, but his jealous wife Cora gives her a cold reception, despite Letty saying she and Beverly (who was raised by Letty's mother) are like brother and sister. Cora is further angered when her children seem to like Letty better.\nAt a party, Sourdough tells Lige that he intends proposing to Letty. Lige explains he was planning to do the same. After Wirt drops by, a cyclone interrupts the festivities. Most of the guests seek shelter in the basement, where Wirt declares his love for Letty and offers to take her away from the dismal place. After the cyclone passes, Lige and Sourdough talk to Letty in private. When they flip a coin to see who will ask for her hand in marriage (Lige wins), Letty thinks it is just a joke.\nAfterward, Cora demands that Letty leave the ranch. Because she has neither money nor a place to go, she decides to go away with Wirt, but then Wirt reveals that he wants her for a mistress, informing her that he already has a wife. She goes back to Cora, who tells her to choose from her two other suitors. She marries Lige.\nWhen Lige takes her home, he kisses Letty for the first time, but her lack of enthusiasm is unmistakable. Worse for the drink, he becomes more forceful, and she tells him she hates him. He promises he will never touch her, and will try to make enough money to send her back to Virginia. In the meantime, Letty works around the house, but is bothered by the ever-present wind.\nOne day, Lige is invited to a meeting of the cattlemen, who must do something to avoid starvation. Letty, terrified of being left alone with the wind, begs to go with him, and he agrees. After she cannot control her horse in the fierce wind, he has her get on behind him on his horse. When she falls off, Lige tells Sourdough to take her home.\nWhen the cattlemen return, they bring an unwanted guest, an injured Wirt. After he recovers, Lige insists he participate in a roundup of wild horses to raise money for the cattlemen. Wirt goes along, but later sneaks away and returns to Letty. Out of her mind with fear as she endures the house shaking from the worst windstorm yet, Letty faints soon after Wirt's arrival. He picks her up and carries her to the bed.\nThe next morning, Wirt tries to persuade Letty to go away with him, but she coldly rejects him. He insists, noting Lige will kill them both if they remain. As Wirt becomes more aggressive, Letty picks up Wirt's revolver from the table to defend herself. Confident that Letty will not fire, Wirt grabs the gun and it goes off, killing him. At first startled by Wirt's death, Letty looks confusedly at him and at the gun in her hand; she then decides to bury him outside.\nAfter she is done, she goes back inside the cabin. The wind blows into an even greater fury, and Letty stares with mounting fear through a window as the wind gradually uncovers Wirt's body. Letty runs away from the window, but then sees two hands clasped around the cabin's door trying to force it open; Letty hysterically believes it is Wirt returned from the dead, and falls prone with terror, her face hidden, as someone enters. The hands turn her over, and Letty stares upward blank with madness. However, it is actually Lige, who has returned. After a few moments, Letty returns to sanity and recognizes Lige; she is so glad to see him, she frantically kisses her husband. She then confesses she killed and buried Wirt. When Lige looks outside, however, the corpse is nowhere to be seen. He tells Letty that the wind can remove traces when a killing is justified. He has enough money to send her away, but Letty declares that she loves him, that she no longer wants to leave, and that she is no longer afraid of the wind or anything else.\nMusic.\nIn 2019, the Dallas Chamber Symphony commissioned an original film score for \"The Wind\" from composer Alain Mayrand. The score premiered during a concert screening on November 23, 2019 at Moody Performance Hall with Richard McKay conducting.\nThis film featured a theme song entitled \"Love Brought The Sunshine\" which was composed by William Axt, David Mendoza, Herman Ruby and Dave Dreyer.\nProduction.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n Actor Lillian Gish on being directed by Victor Seastrom in \"The Scarlet Letter\" (1929): \u201cHis direction was a great education to me. In a sense, I went through the Swedish school of acting. I had gotten rather close to the Italian school: The Italian school is one of elaboration; the Swedish is one of repression.\u201d\u2014 from Albert Bigelow Paine\u2019s \"Life and Lillian Gish\" (1932).\nGish came up with the idea of making a film adaptation of the novel of the same name. Irving Thalberg immediately gave her permission to do so. Gish recalled wanting Lars Hanson as her leading man after seeing him in a Swedish film with Greta Garbo. She also assigned Victor Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m as the director herself. Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m had directed Gish before in the 1926 film \"The Scarlet Letter\".\nIn the original novel, the heroine is driven mad when the wind uncovers the corpse of the man she has killed. She then wanders off into a windstorm to die. According to Gish and popular legend, the original ending intended for the film was the unhappy ending, but it was changed in response to the decree, by the studio's powerful Eastern office, that a more upbeat ending be shot. It is rumored that this tampering caused Seastrom to move back to Sweden. Mayer's biographer rejects this on account that the \"sad ending\" is not known to exist in any form, written or filmed. Regardless of whether an unhappy ending was originally intended, in the resulting film the \"happy\" ending replaced the original ending against the wishes of both Lillian Gish and Victor Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m.\nThe film was shot partially near Bakersfield and the Mojave Desert, California.\nRelease.\nAlthough it was completed by the summer of 1927, the film's release was delayed by the studio until November 23 in 1928, a full year after the release of \"The Jazz Singer\" (1927), when audiences wanted sound films. Gish recalled: \u201cMr. Thalberg said we had a very artistic film, which I knew was a veiled punch,\u201d Like a number of films that appeared on the cusp of the new sound film era, \"The Wind\" was overlooked by critics, much as was Josef von Sternberg\u2019s \"The Case of Lena Smith\" (1929).\nBox office.\nMetro-Goldwyn-Mayer was nervous about releasing the film and did not release it for a full year until November 1928. It was released with a Movietone score and sound effects for theaters equipped with sound; however, by that time, films with 100% dialogue/ talking sequences were being released in theaters, which contributed to \"The Wind\" recording an $87,000 loss.\nContemporary response.\n\"The Wind\" is considered to be a classic, and one of Gish's most brilliant performances. It is the last silent film starring Gish, one of the last films directed by Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m in America, and the last major silent released by MGM. At its time it was simultaneously panned and hailed by American critics, and its late release at the dawn of the sound era contributed to a net loss for the production. However, the film had significant critical and considerable commercial success in Europe.\nWhen the film first opened in 1928, many critics panned it. Mordaunt Hall, film critic for \"The New York Times,\" for example, was very critical of the film and he found it difficult to suspend his disbelief regarding the special effects and Lillian Gish's acting. He wrote, \"Yesterday afternoon's rain was far more interesting than...\"The Wind,\"...The rain was real, and in spite of the lowering skies there was life and color around you. In the picture, the wind, whether it is a breeze or a cyclone, invariably seems a sham, and Lillian Gish, the stellar light in this new film, frequently poses where the wind is strongest; during one of the early episodes she does her bit to accentuate the artificiality of this tale by wearing the worst kind of hat for a wind. Victor Seastrom hammers home his points until one longs for just a suggestion of subtlety. The villain's sinister smile appears to last until his dying breath.\"\nRetrospective assessment.\n\"The Wind\" has gained significant prestige retroactively.\nThe British newspaper, \"The Guardian,\" in 1999 reviewed the work of director Victor Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m and they wrote,\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt; And in America his three most famous works\u2014\"He Who Gets Slapped\" (1924), \"The Scarlet Letter\" (1926) and \"The Wind\" (1928)\u2014each dealt with human suffering. \"The Wind\" is almost certainly the best\u2014a silent classic, revived in recent years by producer/director Kevin Brownlow with a Carl Davis score, which gave the great Lillian Gish one of the finest parts of her career...Sjostrom treats the inevitable clash between Letty and her new surroundings with considerable realism and detail, allowing Gish as much leeway as possible to develop her performance. The entire film was shot in the Mojave Desert under conditions of great hardship and difficulty and this was probably the first 'Western' that tried for truth as well as dramatic poetry. One of its masterstrokes, which looks far less self-conscious than any description of it may seem, is the moment\nwhen Letty hallucinates in terror at the sight of the partially buried body of her attacker.\nIn a retrospective of silent films, the Museum of Modern Art screened \"The Wind\" and included a review of the film in their program. They wrote, \"What makes \"The Wind\" such an eloquent coda to its dying medium is Seastrom's and Gish's distillation of their art forms to the simplest, most elemental form: there are no frills. Seastrom was always at his best as a visual poet of natural forces impinging on human drama; in his films, natural forces convey drama and control human destiny. Gish, superficially fragile and innocent, could plumb the depths of her steely soul and find the will to prevail. The genius of both Seastrom and Gish comes to a climactic confluence in \"The Wind.\" Gish is Everywoman, subject to the most basic male brutality and yet freshly open to the possibility of romance. As a result, the film offers a quintessential cinematic moment of the rarest and most transcendentally pure art.\"\nBiographer Lewis Jacobs compares \"The Wind\" favorably to Austrian-American filmmaker Erich von Stroheim\u2019s 1924 masterpiece \"Greed\":\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"The Wind\" becomes the physical expression of the emotional struggle of the characters\u2026the outstanding quality of the film was its documentary realism, which had much in common with Greed. Like Greed it penetrated into psychology of the characters by means of an objective treatment of their environment.\nJacobs adds that Seastrom, in his treatment of American Midwesterners was \u201cas uncompromising as von Stroheim in depicting it.\u201d\nTheme.\nThe chief thematic element of the picture is suggested by the title, namely \u201chuman lives molded by the elements.\u201d Jacobs writes:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;It is the wind that brings about the young girl\u2019s meeting with a man who subsequently violates her; it is the wind that forces her into an unwanted marriage; it is the wind that finally drives her to madness and murder.\nFilm historian Scott Eyman locates the theme in a social issue that preoccupied Hollywood in the late 1920s: \u201cthe dangers of the city, and the homicidal small-mindedness of the country.\u201d Eyman writes:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;[T]he studios were awash in stories about a woman from the city who comes to a rural environment where her innate erotic charge disrupts the social and family order, usually with disastrous result.\nLegacy.\nIn 1993, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.\"\nFootnotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The film portrays the contemporary racial situation in the United States during the early twentieth century, the years of Jim Crow, the revival of the Ku Klux Klan, the Great Migration of blacks to cities of the North and Midwest, and the emergence of the \"New Negro\".\nThe plot features an African-American woman who goes North in an effort to raise money for a rural school in the Deep South for poor Black children. Her romance with a Black doctor eventually leads to revelations about her family's past and her own mixed-race, European ancestry. The film portrays racial violence under white supremacy, and the lynching of black people. It is the oldest known surviving film by an African-American director and has been named as one of the greatest films of all time by a Black director.\nPlot.\nSylvia Landry, a young African-American woman, visits her cousin Alma in the North. Sylvia is waiting for the return of Conrad as they plan to marry. Alma also loves Conrad. Larry, Alma's step brother, attempts to woo Sylvia but is rebuffed. Larry kills a professional gambler after cheating during a game of poker. Alma arranges for Sylvia to be caught in a seemingly compromising situation by Conrad when he returns. Conrad begins to strangle Sylvia but is stopped by Alma. Conrad leaves for Brazil. Sylvia returns to the South.\nSylvia meets Rev. Jacobs, a minister who runs a rural school for black children called Piney Woods School. The school is overcrowded, and Rev. Jacobs cannot continue on the small amount offered to blacks for education by the state. With the school facing closure, Sylvia volunteers to return to the North to try to raise $5,000.\nSylvia's purse is stolen in Boston. A man named Dr. Vivian chases after the thief and recovers the purse. After running into the street to save a child from being run over, Sylvia is hit by the car herself. As she recovers in the hospital, she meets the owner of the car \u2013 Elena Warwick, a wealthy philanthropist. Learning of Sylvia's mission, Elena decides to give her the needed money. When her Southern friend Mrs. Stratton tries to discourage her, Warwick increases her donation to $50,000. This amount will save the school, and Sylvia returns to the South.\nRev. Jacobs asks for Sylvia's hand in marriage, but Sylvia, now in love with Dr. Vivian, refuses. Larry, on the run from the police, runs into Sylvia and attempts blackmail with secrets of Sylvia's past. Instead of having her secrets revealed to the school by Larry, Sylvia runs away in the night and heads north. Later on, Dr. Vivian searches for Sylvia. Larry, who has run out of money and returned to Alma, is fatally shot during an attempted bank robbery. Dr. Vivian by chance ends up treating Larry and meets Alma. Alma tells Dr. Vivian about Sylvia's past: these flashback scenes are portrayed in the film. Sylvia was adopted and raised by a poor black family, the Landrys, who managed to provide her with an education.\nDuring her youth, Sylvia's father Jasper Landry was wrongfully accused of the murder of Philip Gridlestone, an unpopular but wealthy white landlord, the accusation done by Philip's loyal black servant, Efrem. A white mob attacked the Landry family, lynching the parents and burning their bodies afterwards. Their young son Emil managed to escape after nearly being shot. The mob also lynched Efrem despite him collaborating with them. Sylvia also escaped after being chased and attacked by Armand Gridlestone, Philip's brother, who overpowered her and was close to raping her. Noticing a scar on her breast, Armand realized that Sylvia was in fact his mixed-race daughter, born of his marriage to a local black woman and had paid for her education.\nAfter hearing about her life, Dr. Vivian meets with Sylvia; he encourages her to love her country and take pride in the contributions of African Americans. He professes his love for her, and they marry.\nProduction.\n\"Within Our Gates\" was produced when early film studios in America's first motion picture industry were based in Fort Lee, New Jersey at the beginning of the 20th century.\nOften regarded in the context of D.W. Griffith's \"The Birth of a Nation\" (1915), Micheaux's project has been considered by critics as a response. The film's portrayal of lynching shows \"what Blacks knew and Northern Whites refused to believe\", turning the \"accusation of 'primitivism'... back onto White Southern culture\".\nAlso during this period was the Chicago Race Riot of 1919, in which white mobs killed numerous Black people, and burned residential districts, leaving thousands of Black citizens homeless. The critic Ronald J. Green believes that Micheaux had seen that Black citizens had fought back in Chicago, and chose the title with an allusion to the risk to whites in future racial violence.\n\"Within Our Gates\" was the second of more than forty films directed by Micheaux. On a limited budget, Micheaux had to use borrowed costumes and props. He had no opportunity to reshoot scenes.\nPreservation.\nAfter being presumed lost for decades, the film was found when a single print, titled \"La Negra\" (\"The Black Woman\"), was discovered in 1979 Spain by film historian Thomas Cripps. A brief sequence in the middle of the film was lost. Only four of the original English intertitles survived, the rest having been replaced with Spanish intertitles when acquired by the Filmoteca Espa\u00f1ola for Pts 4,000 in 1956.\nIn 1993, the Library of Congress Motion Picture Conservation Center restored the film as closely as possible to the original. Scott Simmon translated the Spanish titles back into English, removed explanatory material added for Spanish audiences, and drew from the style and diction used by Micheaux in his novels and in the intertitles for \"Body and Soul\", his only silent film to survive with the original intertitles. The missing sequence was summarized with an intertitle frame.\nResponse.\n\"Within Our Gates\" initially was rejected by the Board of Censors in Chicago when Micheaux submitted the film in December 1919. An article in the \"Chicago Defender\" of January 17, 1920, asserted: \"This is the picture that required two solid months to get by the Censor Boards.\" A week later the \"Defender\" reported,\nThose who reasoned with the spectacle of last July in Chicago ever before them, declared the showing pre-eminently dangerous; while those who reasoned with the knowledge of existing conditions, the injustices of the times, the lynchings and handicaps of ignorance, determined that the time is ripe to bring the lesson to the front.\nCritics of the film feared that scenes with lynching and attempted rape would spark interracial violence in a city still tense from the riots of July 1919. Officials in Omaha (which also suffered a racial riot), New Orleans, and other cities objected for similar reasons when they blocked the screening of the film or demanded that those scenes be cut.\nWhen released in January 1920 against reports of the controversy, the film garnered large audiences in Chicago. It was screened in differently cut versions. For example, an article in the \"Defender\" reported that on February 24, 1920, \"Within Our Gates\" would be shown at the States Theater in Chicago \"without the cuts which were made before its initial presentation.\" Other evidence of cuts were extant film stills of scenes that did not appear in the surviving film copy, and viewers' descriptions that differed from the current version of the film.\nIt is considered an important expression of African-American life in the years immediately following World War I, when violent racist incidents occurred throughout the United States, but most frequently in the South. In 1992, \"Within Our Gates\" was selected by the Library of Congress for preservation in the United States National Film Registry as being \"culturally, historically, and aesthetically significant\".\nDJ Spooky created a new score for the film as part of a box set with Kino Lorber.\nIn 2023, \"Within Our Gates\" was named by Slate as one of the greatest films ever created by Black directors. The film was also the earlier film listed by Slate as being part of the \"new Black film canon.\"\nAesthetics.\nMicheaux's work has often been criticized as lacking aesthetic finesse or artistic power. Micheaux constructed \"Within Our Gates\" to educate his audience about racism, uplift, peonage, women's rights, and the urban \"new Negro\" emerging after the Great Migration.\nHis movement in the plot between North and South was similar to that of D. W. Griffith, who used a north\u2013south marriage plot, but also expressed the mobility of peoples during this period. Griffith dramatized a white reunion of regions that canceled the legacy of the Reconstruction Era to leave blacks out of the national picture. Micheaux's film ended with a wedding that united sophisticated African Americans from the North and South. Together, they symbolically lay claim to the whole nation, despite discrimination against blacks in the military, and the racial riots of 1919, which were based in labor and social competition.\nCritics (such as Jane Gaines, Ronald Green, and Pearl Bowser and Louise Spence) note how Micheaux intercut the lynching of the Landry family with the attempted rape of Sylvia by Gridlestone. This editing deconstructed the white ideology that lynching was to punish black men for alleged sexual assaults against white women. Micheaux portrayed the more frequent sexual assaults of black women by white men, alluding to the widespread historical practice of white men taking advantage of black women slaves. Other passages were edited to deconstruct white visual traditions and white ideologies. The film also touched on several current social and political events, including the death of Theodore Roosevelt, the contributions of African-American soldiers to the war, and debates in the US Senate over Jim Crow laws and labor peonage in the South.\nRepresentation of racism.\nThe film portrayed several aspects of contemporary African-American society. Heroes and heroines included Sylvia Landry and Reverend Jacobs, criminals such as Larry, and \"lackeys\" such as a minister whom Mrs. Stafford supported, who encouraged African Americans to reject suffrage. The critic Ronald J. Green suggests that Bernice Ladd as Mrs. Statton represents a \"Lillian Gish figure\", referring to her role in \"The Birth of a Nation\". Statton is portrayed as racist and anti-feminist. Green notes that Micheaux intended the links between the films, and cast Ladd in part for her physical resemblance to Gish. Early in \"Within Our Gates\" Micheaux uses the character Mrs. Geraldine Stratton, a rich southern white woman, to depict the reality of American life not a world where there are no white people. Mrs. Stratton embodies the essence of southern prejudice; as a result of her fear of black women receiving the right to vote, she opposes women suffrage. With the use of the cinematic techniques, the viewer looks over the shoulder of Mrs. Stratton as she reads a newspaper article entitled \"Law Proposed to Stop Negroes\". This article explains that the Mississippi senator James K. Vardaman has proposed a bill to negate the Fifteenth Amendment. Vardaman justifies his action by stating: \"from the soles of their flat feet to the crown of their head, negroes are undoubtedly inferior beings, therefore, how can we in conscience permit them to vote?\"\nEfrem, a servant to Gridlestone, denounced Mr. Landry as the murderer, although he was not a witness to the crime. Overturning the relationship which Efrem believed he had with whites, a mob lynched him when it failed to find the Landrys.\nThe character of Old Ned justifies the present racial system as God's ordained plan; being poor and uneducated are attributes that will lead African Americans into heaven. He preaches to his congregation that \"white folks, with all their schooling, all their wealth, will most all fall into the everlasting inferno, while our race, lacking these vices and whose souls are more pure, most all will ascend to heaven.\" In one of the most heartbreaking and provoking scenes of the film, Old Ned after humiliating himself in a room full of whites, closes the door and turns from a smiling buffoon to a repulsed black man. It has all been a performance. Old Ned says to the camera, \"Again I've sold my birthright. All for a miserable 'mess of pottage.'\" Hopeless and unfulfilled, he states: \"Negroes and whites \u2013 all are equal. As for me, miserable sinner, Hell is my destiny.\" Uncle Tom characters are a staple in mainstream media. As Old Ned reprimands himself, Micheaux implies that these characters are less than a man.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "76639", "revid": "51013163", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=76639", "title": "Minnie Mouse", "text": "Disney cartoon character \nMinerva \"Minnie\" Mouse is an American cartoon character created by the Walt Disney Company. The longtime sweetheart of Mickey Mouse, she is an anthropomorphic mouse with white gloves, a red or pink bow, blue (or pink or red) polka-dotted dress, white bloomers and yellow low-heeled shoes occasionally with ribbons on them. \nThe comic strip story \"Mr. Slicker and the Egg Robbers\" (published September 22 \u2013 December 26, 1930) introduced her father Marcus Mouse and her unnamed mother, both farmers. The same story featured photographs of Minnie's uncle Milton Mouse with his family and her grandparents Marvel Mouse and Matilda Mouse. Her best-known relatives, however, remain her uncle Mortimer Mouse (Mortimer was almost the name of Mickey) and her twin nieces, Millie and Melody Mouse, though most often a single niece, Melody, appears. In many appearances, Minnie is presented as the girlfriend of Mickey Mouse, best friend of Daisy Duck and a friend to Clarabelle Cow.\nIn honor of her 90th anniversary, on January 22, 2018, she joined the ranks of other animated celebrities by receiving her own star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. She was the sixth Disney character to receive this honor. Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck, Winnie the Pooh, Tinker Bell and Snow White have already received this distinction.\nOn January 1, 2024, Minnie Mouse as depicted in her first shorts entered the public domain.\nHistory.\nOrigins of the character.\nMinnie was initially created to be the love interest of Mickey Mouse; concept art for Mickey showed a female mouse alongside him.\nMinnie was designed in the fashion of a flapper girl. Her main outfit consisted of a short flapper girl dress that often revealed her distinctive patched knickers. In the 1929 cartoon \"The Karnival Kid\", it was also revealed that she wears black stockings which were also fashionable among flapper girls. Her shoes are probably her most distinctive article of clothing. For comedic effect, she wears oversized high heeled pumps that are too big for her feet. Her heels often slip out of her shoes and she even loses her shoes completely in \"The Gallopin' Gaucho\". When she walked or danced, the clip clop of her large pumps was usually heard clearly and often went with the rhythm of the music that was played in the background. Along with Mickey, she was redesigned in 1940. Her hat was replaced with a large bow and bows were added to her shoes as well. Her eyes were also given more detail. Throughout the 1940s and 1950s, her look and personality became more conservative. Minnie almost always wears red or pink, but in her early appearances, she could be seen wearing a combination of blue, black or green (when not depicted in black and white).\nMinnie's early personality is cute, playful, musical and flirtatious. She often portrays an entertainer like a dancer or a musician whose affection Mickey is trying to win. Part of the comedy of these early shorts is the varying degree of success Mickey has in wooing Minnie. Unlike later cartoons after the redesign, Minnie often becomes a damsel in distress whom Mickey tries to rescue. She is also subject to a lot of slapstick and rubber hose animation gags. Over the course of the 1930s, Minnie's and Mickey's relationship solidified and they eventually became a steady couple.\nMinnie was first seen in a test screening of the cartoon short \"Plane Crazy\". Minnie is invited to join Mickey in the first flight of his aircraft. She accepts the invitation but not his request for a kiss in mid-flight. Mickey eventually forces Minnie into a kiss, but this only results in her parachuting out of the plane. This first film depicted Minnie as somewhat resistant to the demanding affection of her potential boyfriend and capable of escaping his grasp.\nTheir debut, however, featured the couple already familiar to each other. The next film featuring them was \"The Gallopin' Gaucho\". The film was the second of their series to be produced, but the third to be released and was released on December 30, 1928. We find Minnie employed at the \"Cantina Argentina\", a bar and restaurant established in the Pampas of Argentina. She performs the Tango for Mickey the gaucho and Black Pete the outlaw. Both flirt with her, but the latter intends to abduct her while the former obliges in saving the Damsel in Distress from the villain. All three characters acted as strangers first being introduced to each other.\nBut it was their third cartoon that established the definitive early look and personality of both Mickey and Minnie, as well as Pete. \"Steamboat Willie\" was the third short of the series to be produced, but was released first, on November 18, 1928. Pete was featured as the Captain of the steamboat, Mickey as a crew of one and Minnie as their single passenger. The two mice first star in a sound film and spend most of its duration playing music to the tune of \"Turkey in the Straw\".\nMinnie's Yoo-Hoo.\nHer next appearance was arguably more significant. \"Mickey's Follies\" (August 28, 1929), featured the first performance of the song \"Minnie's Yoo-Hoo\". \"The guy they call little Mickey Mouse\" for the first time addresses an audience to explain that he has \"got a sweetie\" who is \"neither fat nor skinny\" and proudly proclaims that \"she's my little Minnie Mouse\". Mickey then proceeds to explain his reaction to Minnie's call. The song firmly establishes Mickey and Minnie as a couple and expresses the importance Minnie holds for her male partner.\nDamsel in distress.\nHer final appearance for the year was in \"Wild Waves\", carried by a wave into the sea. She panics terribly and seems to start drowning. Mickey uses a rowboat to rescue her and return her to the shore, but Minnie is still visibly shaken from the experience. Mickey starts singing the tune of \"Rocked in the Cradle of the Deep\", a maritime ballad, in an apparent effort to cheer her up. Minnie cheers up and the short ends. This is the second time Minnie is placed in danger and then saved by her new boyfriend. It would not be the last.\nIn fact, this was the case with her next appearance in \"The Cactus Kid\" (May 10, 1930). As the title implies, the short was intended as a Western movie parody, but it is considered to be more or less a remake of \"The Gallopin' Gaucho\" set in Mexico instead of Argentina. Minnie was again cast as the local tavern dancer who is abducted by Peg-Leg Pedro (Black Pete in his first appearance with a peg-leg). Mickey again comes to the rescue. The short is considered significant for being the last short featuring Mickey and Minnie to be animated by Ub Iwerks.\n\"The Shindig\" (July 11, 1930) featured Minnie joining Mickey, Horace and Clarabelle in a barn dance. Among them, Clarabelle seems to be the actual star of the short. Director Burt Gillett turned in another enjoyable entry in the series, proving that production could go on without Iwerks. This was arguably the first time Minnie was upstaged by a female co-star.\nIn \"The Fire Fighters\" (June 20, 1930), Minnie is trapped in a hotel during a fire. She spends the duration of the short in mortal peril but is rescued by firefighters under Chief Mickey Mouse. Horace Horsecollar is among the firefighters. An unnamed cow in the background is possibly Clarabelle making a cameo. The music of the short was, appropriately, the tune of \"There'll Be a Hot Time in the Old Town Tonight\".\nThe next entry in the series is considered curious: \"The Gorilla Mystery\" (October 1, 1930). The short starts with Beppo the Gorilla escaping from a zoo. Mickey learns of it and terribly panics. He phones Minnie to warn her about the dangerous gorilla wandering about. Minnie is unconcerned and plays tunes on her piano for Mickey to hear over the phone and know she is not afraid. Her tunes are interrupted by her scream and Mickey rushes to her house to save her. Meanwhile, Beppo has wrapped up Minnie in rope and holds her hostage. Mickey confronts the gorilla and once again rescues the damsel in distress.\nIntroduction of a pet.\nIn \"The Picnic\" (1930), Minnie introduces her boyfriend to her new pet dog, Rover. This is actually Pluto making his first appearance as an individual character. Two unnamed bloodhound guard dogs strikingly similar to him had previously appeared in \"The Chain Gang\" (August 18, 1930) which featured Mickey incarcerated in prison without Minnie at his side. Otherwise, the short features a typical picnic excursion harassed by forest animals and brought to a premature end by a sudden rain.\nThe final appearance of Minnie during the year was \"Pioneer Days\" (November 20, 1930). The short featured Minnie and her mate as pioneer settlers heading to the American Old West driving a covered wagon in a wagon train. They are unsurprisingly attacked by Native Americans on their way, this was a stock plot of Western movies at the time. While their fellows are either subjected to scalping or running for their lives, Minnie is captured by the attackers. Mickey attempts to rescue her, only to be captured himself. In a reversal of their usual roles, Minnie escapes her captors and rescues her mate. They then dress as soldiers of the United States Army. Their mere appearance proves sufficient to have the entire tribe running for the hills. The Mouse couple stands triumphant at the end. The short has been criticized for its unflattering depiction of Native Americans as rather bestial predators. The finale has been edited out in recent viewings for depicting the \"braves\" submitting to cowardice.\nIn several shorts, comics and TV shows, Minnie owns a black and white kitten named Figaro, who had originated in the Disney animated feature \"Pinocchio\".\nWaning years.\nDuring the second half of the 1930s, Minnie did not appear as often in Mickey cartoons. This was mainly due to the growth in popularity of Mickey's new sidekicks, Goofy, Donald Duck and Pluto, whose appearances in Mickey cartoons had more or less replaced Minnie's role. Minnie's appearances in Mickey cartoons thus became less numerous, but she did have a few major roles in some Pluto and Figaro cartoons during the 1940s. Minnie made a sort of comeback in the 1980s when she was re-introduced in \"Mickey's Christmas Carol\" and then got her own starring role in \"Totally Minnie\".\nContemporary appearances.\nOn January 1, 2024, the copyrights of the first three animated Mickey Mouse cartoons and their portrayal of Mickey and Minnie Mouse expired, and they entered the public domain. They are the silent versions of the cartoons \"Plane Crazy\" and \"The Gallopin' Gaucho\", and the sound cartoon \"Steamboat Willie\". Newer versions of Minnie Mouse remained copyright protected. On January 1, 2025, the sound versions mentioned above, and another twelve cartoons and their depictions of Minnie become public domain.\nTelevision.\nIn \"Mickey Mouse Works\", she appeared in her own segments. Occasionally, she starred in \"Maestro Minnie\" shorts, in which she conducts an orchestra of living instruments that she usually has to tame.\nIn \"House of Mouse\", Minnie is in charge of running the nightclub, while Mickey primarily serves as the host. In one episode of House of Mouse, \"Clarabelle's Big Secret\", Minnie reveals that she has gone to the movies with Mortimer Mouse, although it is not a date.\nShe appears in two children's shows on Disney Jr.: the full-length educational \"Mickey Mouse Clubhouse\" and the spin-off series of shorts \"Minnie's Bow-Toons\", where she runs a \"bow-tique\" selling bows like the ones she and Daisy wear.\nIn the 2013 \"Mickey Mouse\" television series and its 2020 spinoff \"The Wonderful World of Mickey Mouse\", she exhibits the ability to survive her head coming off, doing a 360 degree flip and re-attaching itself, which can happen when she feels surprised.\nIn 2017, as part of the launch of \"Mickey and the Roadster Racers\", Minnie's Happy Helpers adventures appear in the second half of every new episode.\nMinnie as a queen and princess.\nMinnie has had several appearances as a princess throughout the ages, including the \"Mickey Mouse\" short films \"Ye Olden Days\" (1933) and \"Brave Little Tailor\" (1938).\n\"Kingdom Hearts\" series.\nMinnie appears in the \"Kingdom Hearts\" game series as the queen of Disney Castle, with Mickey serving as the king and her husband. She, at the suggestion of a letter left by the missing King, sends Donald Duck and Goofy on their mission to find Mickey and the Keyblade Master, Sora. During \"Kingdom Hearts II\", when Pete's tampering of the past causes the Heartless to appear in Disney Castle, Minnie is forced to fall back to the library up until Sora and company arrive. While Donald and Goofy head out to get the other residents to safety, Sora protects Minnie so that she can get to the Cornerstone of Light. During this time, Minnie shows powers as a sorceress of white magic, casting a holy light on the Heartless that attack. In the prequel \"Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep\", she oversees the annual Dream Festival in Disney Town, where Pete causes mischief until she banishes him to another dimension. Minnie appears in ' as the ruler of the Country of the Musketeers, a world based on the film '. She makes a brief appearance in \"Kingdom Hearts III\", welcoming Mickey, Donald and Goofy back to Disney Castle.\n\"Mickey, Donald, Goofy: The Three Musketeers\".\nIn the 2004 direct-to-video film \"\", Minnie plays the role of the princess of France, who continually daydreams about her true love, Mickey. She is also the only monarch getting in the way of the plans of Pete, who can not take over the kingdom if he can not get rid of her. For this particular film, Minnie is drawn with hair bangs, which do not appear in any later cartoons.\n\"Wizards of Mickey\".\nIn the fantasy comic series \"Wizards of Mickey\", Minnie is the sorceress princess of the kingdom of Dolmen whose people have been turned to stone, leading her to seek a magical Crystal to restore them. In her quest, she partners with her friends Daisy and Clarabelle as team Diamond Moon and eventually meets up with Mickey, the Supreme Sorcerer of Dolmen, and his group.\nVoice actors.\nMinnie Mouse was first voiced by Walt Disney, who was also the original voice of Mickey Mouse.\nMarjorie Ralston, a Disney inker who joined the animation team as Disney's thirteenth employee, voiced Minnie in \"The Barn Dance\", \"Mickey's Choo-Choo\" and \"Wild Waves\", but did not further pursue the role out of shyness. Gloria Narath voiced Minnie in \"The Plowboy\" and \"The Barn Dance\". From 1929 up until 1941, Minnie was voiced by Marcellite Garner. Carol Tevis, Bernice Hansen and Shirley Reed voiced her in guest radio appearances. From 1936 to 1939 and 1946 to 1950, Minnie was voiced by Leone LeDoux. From 1941 to 1942 and on the radio program, \"The Mickey Mouse Theater of the Air\", she was voiced by Thelma Boardman. Boardman also voiced her in the short \"Mickey's Birthday Party\" in 1942. Shirley Reed voiced Minnie in \"Two-Gun Mickey\" except the end. Following this, from 1950 to 1952, Ruth Clifford provided the character's voice. Janet Waldo voiced Minnie in the 1974 Disneyland record album, \"An Adaptation of Dickens' Christmas Carol, Performed by The Walt Disney Players\". In the 1980s, choreographer Barnette Ricci voiced Minnie for live entertainment offerings in the parks, \"Disney on Ice\" shows, and live-action clips for television. Deborah Gates voiced Minnie for commercials, toys, and records in 1985-1987, including the album \"Totally Minnie\".\nIn 1986, Russi Taylor inherited the role of Minnie, which she performed up until her death in 2019 (her husband, Wayne Allwine, voiced Mickey from 1977 up until his death in 2009). Taylor's voice is used in various TV series and theme parks via archival and posthumous dialogue. Kaitlyn Robrock officially took over as the new voice of Minnie, beginning with two Disney Jr. stop-motion Mickey Mouse shorts, \"Mickey Mouse and the Magical Snowy Holiday\" and \"Mickey Mouse and the Magical Holiday Bag\", both released in November 2019.\nRobrock continues voicing Minnie in \"The Wonderful World of Mickey Mouse\" on Disney+.\nAppearances in cartoon shorts.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
