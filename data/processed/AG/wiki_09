His father also held the title of a landgrave of Brabant, duke of Lower Lorraine and margrave of Antwerp. Henry early appeared as a co-ruler of his father. In 1180, he married Matilda of Boulogne, daughter of Marie of Boulogne and Matthew of Alsace and on this occasion received the County of Brussels from his father. He acted as a regent while Count Godfrey III went on a pilgrimage to Jerusalem from 1182 to 1184.\nCareer.\nIn 1183, Henry took the title of duke of Brabant. Upon the death of his father in 1190, King Henry VI confirmed the elevation of Brabant, while he \"de facto\" abolished the Duchy of Lower Lorraine by creating the empty title of a duke of Lothier. Duke Henry sought to expand his power and soon picked several quarrels with the Count Baldwin V of Hainaut. He also was in opposition to the German king (emperor from 1191) when his brother Albert of Louvain was elected bishop of Li\u00e8ge and murdered shortly afterwards.\nFurther conflicts with Duke Henry III of Limburg and Count Otto I of Guelders followed, before in mid-1197 Henry of Brabant joined the Crusade of Henry VI as one of the leaders. In October of the same year he took part in the recapture of Beirut and, then moved to Jaffa with the crusaders: however, before reaching the city he got news of the death of the ruler of the Kingdom of Jerusalem, Count Henry II of Champagne, and he returned to Acre. Here he acted as regent until the arrival of the new king, Aimery of Cyprus.\nBack in Germany after the emperor's death in September 1197, Duke Henry supported the election of the Welf candidate Otto IV, the fianc\u00e9 of his daughter Maria, who rivalled with the Hohenstaufen scion Philip of Swabia. He fought against Philip's seconders Count Dirk VII of Holland and Count Otto of Guelders, however, he switched sides in 1204, when he and King Philip II of France backed Philip against Otto. In 1208, after the assassination of Philip, Henry was proposed as successor by King Philip II. In the war which followed, he finally reached a reconciliation with Emperor Otto IV. Together they fought against King Philip in the 1214 Battle of Bouvines, but the two were defeated.\nIn 1213, Duke Henry also suffered a heavy defeat against the Bishopric of Li\u00e8ge in the Battle of Steppes. From 1217 to 1218 he joined the Fifth Crusade to Egypt.\nUnder Henry I, there was town policy and town planning. His attention went out to those regions that lent themselves to the extension of his sovereignty and in some locations he used the creation of a new town as an instrument in the political organisation of the area. Among the towns to which the duke gave city rights and trade privileges were 's-Hertogenbosch and Eindhoven.\nIn 1234, he participated in the Stedinger Crusade. In 1235, Emperor Frederick II appointed Henry to travel to England to bring him his fianc\u00e9e Isabella, daughter of King John of England. Henry fell ill on his way back and died at Cologne. He was buried in Saint Peter's Church at Leuven where his Late Romanesque effigy can still be seen.\nMarriages.\nHenry had six children by his first marriage with Mathilde of Boulogne:\nHis second marriage was on 22 April 1213 in Soissons to Marie, daughter of King Philip II of France. They had two children:\nDeath, burial, and tomb.\nIn 1235, Henry I was commissioned by the German emperor Frederick II of Hohenstaufen to accompany the imperial fianc\u00e9e Isabella Plantagenet from England to Germany. However, he died en route in Cologne, before he could complete his assignment.\nHis tomb in Saint Peter's Church, Leuven is the oldest surviving of its kind. The image of Henry I has been idealised in the relief: he is depicted as a smiling young man. In addition, he lies on a high base, wears a long robe and the duke's cloak, and holds a sceptre; his left hand plays with the cord of the mantle. The archangels Rapha\u00ebl and Michael wave the censer at his head. In addition to the tomb of Hendrik I van Brabant, there are also the tombs of his wife Mathilde van Boulogne and his daughter, Maria van Brabant.\nOriginally, the tomb was at the altar. This was a privilege reserved only for prominent families and high clergy. The initially Romanesque church was replaced by a Gothic church in the fifteenth century. It was then that Hendrik's grave was moved and given a place of honour in front of the high altar. During the French occupation in the eighteenth century, the grave was destroyed and its remains were buried under the tower. \nOnly in the mid-19th century was the burial monument restored and placed in the chapel of Saint John of Latheran. The bones of Hendrik I were dug up in 1929, and only a few decades later, namely in 1998, were they put back in the tomb. In the meantime, the monument has been relocated and is back in its original place: in front of the high altar.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "75982", "revid": "48984234", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=75982", "title": "Defecation", "text": "Expulsion of feces from the digestive tract\nDefecation (or defaecation) follows digestion and is the necessary biological process by which organisms eliminate a solid, semisolid, or liquid waste material known as feces (or faeces) from the digestive tract via the anus or cloaca. The act has a variety of names, ranging from the technical (e.g. bowel movement), to the common (like pooping or crapping), to the obscene (\"shitting\"), to the euphemistic (\"doing number two\", \"dropping a deuce\" or \"taking a dump\"), to the juvenile (\"going poo-poo\" or \"making doo-doo\"). The topic, usually avoided in polite company, forms the basis of scatological humor.\nHumans expel feces with a frequency varying from a few times daily to a few times weekly. Waves of muscular contraction (known as \"peristalsis\") in the walls of the colon move fecal matter through the digestive tract towards the rectum. Flatus may also be expulsed. Undigested food may also be expelled within the feces, in a process called egestion. When birds defecate, they also expel urine and urates in the same mass, whereas other animals may also simultaneously urinate during defecation, but the processes are spatially separated. Defecation may also accompany childbirth and death. Babies defecate a unique substance called meconium prior to eating external foods.\nThere are a number of medical conditions associated with defecation, such as diarrhea and constipation, some of which can be serious. A simpler and more mundane concern is the maintenance of anal hygiene, which usually calls for cleaning the area shortly after defecation. The feces expelled can carry diseases, most often through the contamination of food. \"E. coli\" is a particular concern.\nBefore toilet training, human feces are most often collected into a diaper. Thereafter, in many societies people commonly defecate into a toilet. A Western-style flush toilet requires a sitting position, as compared with a squat toilet. However, open defecation, the practice of defecating outside without using a toilet of any kind, is still widespread in some developing countries; some people in those countries defecate into the ocean. Well-developed countries use sewage treatment plants or on-site treatment for blackwater.\nDescription.\nPhysiology.\nThe rectum ampulla stores fecal waste (also called stool) before it is excreted. As the waste fills the rectum and expands the rectal walls, stretch receptors in the rectal walls stimulate the desire to defecate. This urge to defecate arises from the reflex contraction of rectal muscles, relaxation of the internal anal sphincter, and an initial contraction of the skeletal muscle of the external anal sphincter. If the urge is not acted upon, the material in the rectum is often returned to the colon by reverse peristalsis, where more water is absorbed and the feces are stored until the next mass peristaltic movement of the transverse and descending colon.\nWhen the rectum is full, an increase in pressure within the rectum forces apart the walls of the anal canal, allowing the fecal matter to enter the canal. The rectum shortens as material is forced into the anal canal and peristaltic waves push the feces out of the rectum. The internal and external anal sphincters along with the puborectalis muscle allow the feces to be passed by muscles pulling the anus up over the exiting feces.\nVoluntary and involuntary control.\nThe external anal sphincter is under voluntary control whereas the internal anal sphincter is involuntary. In infants, the defecation occurs by reflex action without the voluntary control of the external anal sphincter. Defecation is voluntary in adults. Young children learn voluntary control through the process of toilet training. Once trained, loss of control, called fecal incontinence, may be caused by physical injury, nerve injury, prior surgeries (such as an episiotomy), constipation, diarrhea, loss of storage capacity in the rectum, intense fright, inflammatory bowel disease, psychological or neurological factors, childbirth, or death.\nSometimes, due to the inability to control one's bowel movement or due to excessive fear, defecation (usually accompanied by urination) occurs involuntarily, soiling a person's undergarments. This may cause significant embarrassment to the person if this occurs in the presence of other people or a public place.\nPosture.\nThe positions and modalities of defecation are culture-dependent. Squat toilets are used by the vast majority of the world, including most of Africa, Asia, and the Middle East. The use of sit-down toilets in the Western world is a relatively recent development, beginning in the 19th century with the advent of indoor plumbing.\nDisease.\nRegular bowel movements determine the functionality and the health of the alimentary tracts in human body. Defecation is the most common regular bowel movement which eliminates waste from the human body. The frequency of defecation is hard to identify, which can vary from daily to weekly depending on individual bowel habits, the impact from the environment, and genetics. If defecation is delayed for a prolonged period the fecal matter may harden, resulting in constipation. If defecation occurs too fast, before excess liquid is absorbed, diarrhea may occur. Other associated symptoms can include abdominal bloating, abdominal pain, and abdominal distention. Disorders of the bowel can seriously impact quality of life and daily activities. The causes of functional bowel disorder are multifactorial, and dietary habits such as food intolerance and low fiber diet are considered to be the primary factors.\nConstipation.\nConstipation, also known as defecatory dysfunction, is difficulty experienced when passing stools. It is one of the most notable alimentary disorders that affects different age groups in the population. Common constipation is associated with abdominal distention, pain or bloating. Research has revealed that chronic constipation complied with higher risk of cardiovascular events such as coronary heart disease and ischemic stroke, while associating with an increasing risk of mortality. Besides dietary factors, psychological traumas and 'pelvic floor disorders' can also cause chronic constipation and defecatory disorder respectively. Multiple interventions, including physical activities, 'high-fibre diet', probiotics and drug therapies can be widely and efficiently used to treat constipation and defecatory disorder.\nInflammatory bowel diseases.\nInflammatory disease is characterized as long-lasting, chronic inflammation throughout the gastrointestinal tract. Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are two universal types of inflammatory bowel disease that have been studied over a century. They are closely related to different environmental risk factors, family genetics, and lifestyle choices such as smoking. Crohn's disease has been found to be related to immune disorders particularly. Different levels of cumulative intestinal injuries can cause different complications, such as fistulae, damage of bowel function, symptom recurrence, disability, etc. Patients can be children or adults. Recent research shows that immunodeficiency and monogenic disorders are the causes in young patients with inflammatory bowel diseases. \nCommon symptoms of inflammatory bowel diseases differ by the infection level, but may include severe abdominal pain, diarrhea, fatigue, and unexpected weight loss. Crohn's disease can lead to infection of any part of the digestive tract, including ileum to anus. Internal manifestations include diarrhea, abdomen pain, fever, chronic anaemia, etc. External manifestations include impact on skin, joints, eyes, and liver. Significantly reduced microbiota diversity inside the gastrointestinal tract can also be observed. Ulcerative colitis mainly affects the function of the large bowel, and its incidence rate is three times greater than that of Crohn's disease. In terms of clinical features, over 90 percent of patients exhibit constant diarrhea, rectal bleeding, softer stool, mucus in the stool, tenesmus, and abdominal pain. The symptoms may continue for around 6 weeks or even longer.\nThe inflammatory bowel diseases could be effectively treated by 'pharmacotherapies' to relieve and maintain the symptoms, which showed in 'mucosal healing' and symptoms elimination. However, an optimal therapy for curing both inflammatory diseases are still under research due to the heterogeneity in clinical feature. Although both UC and CD are sharing similar symptoms, the medical treatment of them are distinctively different. Dietary treatment can benefit for curing CD by increase the dietary zinc and fish intake, which is related to mucosal healing of the bowel. Treatments vary from drug treatment to surgery based on the active level of the CD. UC can also be relieved by using immunosuppressive therapy for mild to moderate disease level and application of biological agents for severe cases.\nIrritable bowel syndrome.\nIrritable bowel syndrome is diagnosed as an intestinal disorder with chronic abdominal pain and inconsistency in form of stool, and is a common bowel disease that can be easily diagnosed in modern society. The variation in incident rate can be explained by different diagnostic criteria in different countries, with the 18\u201334 age group being recognized as the high frequency incident group. The definite cause of irritable bowel syndrome remains a mystery; however, it has been found to relate to multiple factors, such as 'alternation of mood and pressure, sleep disorders, food triggers, changing of dysbiosis and even sexual dysfunction'. One third of irritable bowel syndrome patients has family history with the disease suggesting that genetic predisposition could be a significant cause for irritable bowel syndrome.\nPatients with irritable bowel syndrome commonly experience abdominal pain, changes to stool form, recurrent abdominal bloating and gas, co-morbid disorders and alternation in bowel habits that caused diarrhea or constipation. However, anxiety and tension can also be detected, although patients with irritable bowel disease seem healthy. Apart from these typical symptoms, rectal bleeding, unexpected weight loss and increased inflammatory markers require further medical examination and investigation.\nTreatment for irritable bowel disease is multimodal. Dietary intervention and pharmacotherapies can both relieve the symptoms to a certain degree. Avoiding allergic food groups can be beneficial by reducing fermentation in the digestive tract and gas production, hence effectively alleviating abdominal pain and bloating. Drug interventions, such as laxatives, loperamide, and lubiprostone are applied to relieve intense symptoms including diarrhea, abdominal pain and constipation. Psychological treatment, dietary supplements and gut-focused hypnotherapy are recommended for targeting depression, mood disorders and sleep disturbance.\nBowel obstruction.\nBowel obstruction is a bowel condition which is a blockage that can be found in both the small intestines and large intestines. Increase of contractions can relieve blockages; however, continuous contractions with decreasing functionality may lead to terminated mobility of the small intestines, which then forms the obstruction. At the same time, the lack of contractility encourages liquid and gas accumulation. and \"electrolyte disturbances\". Small bowel obstruction can result in severe renal damage and hypovolemia. while evolving into \"mucosal ischemia and perforation\". Patients with small bowel obstruction were found to experience constipation, strangulation and abdominal pain and vomiting. Surgical intervention is primarily used to cure severe small bowel obstruction condition. Nonoperative therapy included nasogastric tube decompression, water-soluble-contrast medium process or symptomatic management can be applied to treat less severe symptoms\nAccording to research, large bowel obstruction is less common than small bowel obstruction, but is still associated with a high mortality rate. Large bowel obstruction, also known as colonic obstruction, includes acute colonic obstruction, where a blockage is formed in the colon. Colonic obstructions frequently occur within the elder population, often accompanied by significant 'comorbidities'. Although colonic malignancy is revealed as the major cause of the colonic obstruction, volvulus has also been founded as a secondary common cause around the world. In addition, lower mobility, unhealthy mentality and restricted living environment are also listed as risk factors. Surgery and colonic stent placements are widely applied for curing colonic obstructions.\nOther.\nAttempting forced expiration of breath against a closed airway (the Valsalva maneuver) is sometimes practiced to induce defecation while on a toilet. This contraction of expiratory chest muscles, diaphragm, abdominal wall muscles, and pelvic diaphragm exerts pressure on the digestive tract. Ventilation at this point temporarily ceases as the lungs push the chest diaphragm down to exert the pressure. Cardiac arrest and other cardiovascular complications can in rare cases occur due to attempting to defecate using the Valsalva maneuver. Valsalva retinopathy is another pathological syndrome associated with the Valsalva maneuver. Thoracic blood pressure rises and as a reflex response the amount of blood pumped by the heart decreases. Death has been known to occur in cases where defecation causes the blood pressure to rise enough to cause the rupture of an aneurysm or to dislodge blood clots (see thrombosis). Also, in releasing the Valsalva maneuver blood pressure falls; this, coupled with standing up quickly to leave the toilet, can result in a blackout.\nSociety and culture.\nOpen defecation.\nOpen defecation is the human practice of defecating outside (in the open environment) rather than into a toilet. People may choose fields, bushes, forests, ditches, streets, canals or other open space for defecation. They do so because either they do not have a toilet readily accessible or due to traditional cultural practices. The practice is common where sanitation infrastructure and services are not available. Even if toilets are available, behavior change efforts may still be needed to promote the use of toilets.\nOpen defecation can pollute the environment and cause health problems. High levels of open defecation are linked to high child mortality, poor nutrition, poverty, and large disparities between rich and poor.11\nEnding open defecation is an indicator being used to measure progress towards the Sustainable Development Goal Number 6. Extreme poverty and lack of sanitation are statistically linked. Therefore, eliminating open defecation is thought to be an important part of the effort to eliminate poverty.\nAnal cleansing after defecation.\nThe anus and buttocks may be cleansed after defecation with toilet paper, similar paper products, or other absorbent material. In many cultures, such as Hindu and Muslim, water is used for anal cleansing after defecation, either in addition to using toilet paper or exclusively. When water is used for anal cleansing after defecation, toilet paper may be used for drying the area afterwards. Some doctors and people who work in the science and hygiene fields have stated that switching to using a bidet as a form of anal cleansing after defecation is both more hygienic and more environmentally friendly.\nMythology and tradition.\nSome peoples have culturally significant stories in which defecation plays a role. For example:\nPsychology.\nSome aspects of psychology surround the act of defecation. There is an inherent desire for privacy among humans. Freud stipulated a second stage of development, the Anal Stage, which centers around the release of waste from the bladder and bowels. He categorized two types: \"anal retentive\" and \"anal expulsive\".\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The plot derives from William Shakespeare's \"King Lear\" and includes segments based on legends of the \"daimy\u014d\" M\u014dri Motonari. The film stars Tatsuya Nakadai as Hidetora Ichimonji, an aging \"Sengoku\"-period warlord who decides to abdicate as ruler in favor of his three sons.\nLike most of Kurosawa's work in the 1970s and 80s, \"Ran\" is an international production, in this case a Japanese-French venture produced by Herald Ace, Nippon Herald Films, and Greenwich Film Productions. Production planning went through a long period of preparation. Kurosawa conceived the idea of \"Ran\" in the mid-1970s, when he read about Motonari, who was famous for having three highly loyal sons. Kurosawa devised a plot in which the sons become antagonists of their father. Although the film became heavily inspired by Shakespeare's play \"King Lear\", Kurosawa began using it only after he had started preparations for \"Ran\". Following these preparations, Kurosawa filmed \"Dersu Uzala\" in 1975, followed by \"Kagemusha\" in the early 1980s, before securing financial backing to film \"Ran\".\n\"Ran\" was Kurosawa's third encounter with Shakespeare during his career. In 1957, Kurosawa directed \"Throne of Blood\", based on Shakespeare's \"Macbeth\". In 1960, he directed the film \"The Bad Sleep Well\", based on \"Hamlet\". All three films have received critical acclaim.\nAs Kurosawa's last epic, \"Ran\" has often been cited as among his finest achievements and is widely regarded as one of the greatest films ever made. With a budget of $, it was among the most expensive films in the history of Japanese cinema upon its release. \"Ran\" was previewed on May 31, 1985, at the Tokyo International Film Festival before its release on June 1, 1985, in Japan. The film was hailed for its powerful images and use of color; costume designer Emi Wada won an Academy Award for Best Costume Design for her work on \"Ran\", and Kurosawa received his only career nomination for Best Director. The distinctive film score, inspired by Gustav Mahler, was composed by Toru Takemitsu.\nPlot.\nHidetora Ichimonji, a powerful but elderly warlord, decides to divide his kingdom among his three sons. Taro, the eldest, will receive the prestigious First Castle and become leader of the Ichimonji clan, though Hidetora will retain the title of Great Lord. Second and third sons Jiro and Saburo are to support Taro and will be given the Second and Third Castles. However, Saburo is exiled after criticizing his father's lecture about unity. Hidetora's retainer Tango is also exiled for defending Saburo.\nTaro's wife Lady Kaede urges him to take full control of the clan. When Taro demands Hidetora renounce his title, a furious Hidetora leaves and travels to Jiro's castle, only to discover that Jiro is only interested in using him as a pawn. As Hidetora and his retinue wander, he decides to take over the Third Castle, which had become deserted after Saburo's exile.\nLater, the Third Castle is attacked by Taro and Jiro's combined forces, and all of Hidetora's retinue are either killed or commit ritual suicide. Jiro's general Kurogane takes advantage of the confusion and shoots Taro dead with an arquebus. Hidetora succumbs to madness and is allowed to leave. Tango and court fool Kyoami, still loyal to Hidetora, accompany him as he wanders across the land, haunted by visions of the people he killed in the past. They take refuge in a peasant's home only to discover that the occupant is Tsurumaru, the brother of Lady Sue, Jiro's wife. Hidetora had blinded Tsurumaru after massacring his family and left him impoverished.\nWith Taro dead, Jiro becomes the Great Lord of the Ichimonji clan, and moves into the First Castle. Lady Kaede seduces Jiro, and demands that he kill Lady Sue and marry her instead. Jiro orders Kurogane to do the deed, but he refuses, seeing through Kaede's perfidy. Kurogane then warns Sue and Tsurumaru to flee. Tango, learning that Jiro is considering sending assassins after Hidetora, rides off to alert Saburo.\nSaburo's army enters Jiro's territory to find Hidetora, forcing Jiro to hastily mobilize his army. A brief truce is reached and Saburo rides off after learning of Hidetora's whereabouts. Jiro breaks the truce and attacks Saburo's remaining forces, suffering significant losses, and is forced to retreat when informed that the armies of the neighbouring lords are marching on the First Castle. Saburo tracks down Hidetora, who has partially recovered his sanity, and the two reconcile. However, Saburo is shot and killed by one of Jiro's assassins. Overcome with grief, Hidetora dies on his son's body. Tsurumaru and Sue arrive at the ruins of the family castle. Sue leaves to retrieve the flute Tsurumaru has inadvertently left behind, giving him a picture of Amida Buddha for protection before she departs. She never returns.\nAs the First Castle is besieged, Kurogane learns of Sue's death, and confronts Kaede. After confessing that her plot was revenge against the entire Ichimonji clan for massacring her family, Kaede is killed by Kurogane. Jiro, Kurogane and all Jiro's men subsequently die in battle. A funeral procession is held for Saburo and Hidetora. Meanwhile, left alone in the castle ruins, Tsurumaru trips, dropping the Amida Buddha image Sue had given to him.\nProduction.\n\"Ran\" was Kurosawa's last epic film and by far his most expensive. At the time, its budget of $ made it the most expensive Japanese film in history, leading to its distribution in 1985 exceeding the budget of $7.5 million for his previous film \"Kagemusha\". It is a Japanese-French venture produced by Herald Ace, Nippon Herald Films, and Greenwich Film Productions. Filming started in 1983. The 1,400 uniforms and suits of armor used for the extras were designed by costume designer Emi Wada and Kurosawa, and were handmade by master tailors over more than two years. The film also used 200 horses. Kurosawa loved filming in lush and expansive locations, and most of \"Ran\" was shot amidst the mountains and plains of Mount Aso, Japan's largest active volcano. Kurosawa was granted permission to shoot at two of the country's most famous landmarks, the ancient castles at Kumamoto and Himeji. For the castle of Lady Sue's family, he used the ruins of the custom-constructed Azusa castle, made by Kurosawa's production crew near Mount Fuji. Hidetora's third castle, which was burned to the ground, was a real building which Kurosawa built on the slopes of Mount Fuji. No miniatures were used for that segment, and Tatsuya Nakadai had to do the scene where Hidetora flees the castle in one take. Kurosawa also filmed a scene that required an entire field to be sprayed gold, but cut it out of the final film during editing. The documentary \"A.K.\" shows the filming of the scene.\nKurosawa often shot scenes with three cameras simultaneously, each using different lenses and angles. Many long-shots were employed and very few close-ups. On several occasions, Kurosawa used static cameras and suddenly brought the action into frame, rather than using the camera to track the action. He also used jump cuts to progress certain scenes, changing the pace of the action for filmic effect.\nAkira Kurosawa's wife of 39 years, Y\u014dko Yaguchi, died during the production of the film. He halted filming for one day to mourn before resuming work. His regular recording engineer Fumio Yanoguchi also died late in production in January 1985.\nCrew.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nPersonnel taken from The Criterion Collection.\nDevelopment.\nKurosawa conceived of the idea that became \"Ran\" in the mid-1970s, when he read a parable about the Sengoku-period warlord M\u014dri Motonari. Motonari was famous for having three sons, all incredibly loyal and talented. Kurosawa began imagining what would have happened had they been bad. Although the film eventually became heavily inspired by Shakespeare's play \"King Lear\", Kurosawa became aware of the play only after he had started pre-planning. According to him, the stories of M\u014dri Motonari and Lear merged in a way he was never fully able to explain. He wrote the script shortly after filming \"Dersu Uzala\" in 1975, and then \"let it sleep\" for seven years. During this time, he painted storyboards of every shot in the film (later included with the screenplay and available on the Criterion Collection DVD release) and then continued searching for funding. Following his success with 1980's \"Kagemusha\", which he later considered a \"dress rehearsal\" or \"dry run\" for \"Ran\", Kurosawa was finally able to secure backing from French producer Serge Silberman.\nKurosawa once said \"Hidetora is me\", and there is evidence in the film that Hidetora serves as a stand-in for Kurosawa. Roger Ebert agrees, arguing that \"Ran\" \"may be as much about Kurosawa's life as Shakespeare's play\". \"Ran\" was the final film of Kurosawa's \"third period\" (1965\u20131985), a time when he had difficulty securing support for his pictures, and was frequently forced to seek foreign financial backing. While he had directed over twenty films in the first two decades of his career, he directed just four in these two decades. After directing \"Red Beard\" (1965), Kurosawa discovered that he was considered old-fashioned and did not work again for almost five years. He also found himself competing against television, which had reduced Japanese film audiences from a high of 1.1 billion in 1958 to under 200 million by 1975. In 1968, he was fired from the 20th Century Fox epic \"Tora! Tora! Tora!\" over what he described as creative differences, but others said was a perfectionism that bordered on insanity. Kurosawa tried to start an independent production group with three other directors, but his 1970 film \"Dodes'ka-den\" was a box-office flop and bankrupted the company. Many of his younger rivals boasted that he was finished. A year later, unable to secure any domestic funding and plagued by ill health, Kurosawa attempted suicide by slashing his wrists. Though he survived, his misfortune continued to plague him until the late 1980s. According to Stephen Prince, medical treatment and Mosfilm's offer to make a film in Russia (\"Dersu Uzala\") helped Kurosawa's eventual \"spiritual recovery.\"\nKurosawa was influenced by the William Shakespeare play \"King Lear\" and borrowed elements from it. Both depict an aging warlord who decides to divide up his kingdom among his children. Hidetora has three sons \u2013 Taro, Jiro, and Saburo \u2013 who correspond to Lear's daughters Goneril, Regan, and Cordelia. In both, the warlord foolishly banishes anyone who disagrees with him as a matter of pride \u2013 in Lear it is the Earl of Kent and Cordelia; in \"Ran\" it is Tango and Saburo. The conflict in both is that two of the lord's children ultimately turn against him, while the third supports him, though Hidetora's sons are far more ruthless than Goneril and Regan. Both \"King Lear\" and \"Ran\" end with the death of the entire family, including the lord.\nThere are some crucial differences between the two stories. \"King Lear\" is a play about undeserved suffering, and Lear himself is at worst a fool. Hidetora, by contrast, has been a cruel warrior for most of his life: a man who ruthlessly murdered men, women, and children to achieve his goals. In \"Ran\", Lady Kaede, Lady Sue, and Tsurumaru were all victims of Hidetora. Whereas in \"King Lear\" the character of Gloucester had his eyes gouged out by Lear's enemies, in \"Ran\" it was Hidetora himself who gave the order to blind Tsurumaru. The role of the Fool has been expanded into a major character (Kyoami). Kurosawa was concerned that Shakespeare gave his characters no past, and he wanted to give his version of \"King Lear\" a history.\nThe complex and variant etymology for the word \"Ran\" used as the title has been variously translated as \"chaos\", \"rebellion\", or \"revolt\"; or to mean \"disturbed\" or \"confused\".\nFilming.\nThe filming of \"Ran\" began in 1983. The development and conception of the filming of the war scenes in the film were influenced by Kurosawa's opinions on nuclear warfare. According to Michael Wilmington, Kurosawa told him that much of the film was a metaphor for nuclear warfare and the anxiety of the post-Hiroshima age. He believed that, despite all of the technological progress of the 20th century, all people had learned was how to kill each other more efficiently. In \"Ran\", the vehicle for apocalyptic destruction is the arquebus, an early firearm that was introduced to Japan in the 16th century. Arquebuses revolutionized samurai warfare. Kurosawa had already dealt with this theme in his previous film \"Kagemusha\", in which the Takeda cavalry is destroyed by the arquebuses of the Oda and Tokugawa clans.\nIn \"Ran\", the battle of Hachiman Field is an illustration of this new kind of warfare. Saburo's arquebusiers annihilate Jiro's cavalry and drive off his infantry by engaging them from the woods, where the cavalry are unable to venture. Similarly, Taro and Saburo's assassination by a sniper also shows how individual heroes can be easily disposed of on a modern battlefield. Kurosawa also illustrates this new warfare with his camera. Instead of focusing on the warring armies, he frequently sets the focal plane beyond the action, so that in the film they appear as abstract entities.\nCasting.\nThe description of Hidetora in the first script was originally based on Toshiro Mifune. However, the role was cast to Tatsuya Nakadai, an actor who had played several supporting and major characters in previous Kurosawa films, such as Shingen and his double in \"Kagemusha\". Other Kurosawa veterans in \"Ran\" were Masayuki Yui (Tango), Jinpachi Nezu (Jiro) and Daisuke Ryu (Saburo), all of whom were in \"Kagemusha\". For Akira Terao (Taro) and Mieko Harada (Lady Kaede), \"Ran\" was their first Kurosawa film, but they would go on to work with him again in \"Dreams\". Hisashi Igawa (Kurogane), who had previously been in Kurosawa's \"Dodes'ka-den\", would reappear in both \"Dreams\" and \"Rhapsody in August\". Kurosawa also hired two popular entertainers for supporting roles: singer-dancer Shinnosuke \"Peter\" Ikehata as Hidetora's loyal fool Kyoami and comedian-musician Hitoshi Ueki as rival warlord Nobuhiro Fujimaki. About 1,400 extras were employed.\nActing style.\nWhile most of the characters in \"Ran\" are portrayed by conventional acting techniques, two performances are reminiscent of Japanese Noh theatre. Noh is a form of Japanese traditional theatre requiring highly trained actors and musicians where emotions are primarily conveyed by stylized conventional gestures. The heavy, ghost-like make-up worn by Tatsuya Nakadai's character, Hidetora, resembles the emotive masks worn by traditional Noh performers. The body language exhibited by the same character is also typical of Noh theatre: long periods of static motion and silence, followed by an abrupt, sometimes violent, change in stance. The character of Lady Kaede is also Noh-influenced. The Noh treatment emphasizes the ruthless, passionate, and single-minded natures of these two characters.\nMusic.\nCraig Lysy, writing for \"Movie Music UK\", commented on the strengths of the film soundtrack's composer for Kurosawa's purposes: \"T\u014dru Takemitsu was Japan's preeminent film score composer and Kurosawa secured his involvement in 1976, during the project's early stages. Their initial conception of the score was to use tategoe, a \"shrill-voice\" chant style without instrumentation. Over the intervening years, Kurosawa's conception of the score changed dramatically. As they began production his desire had changed 180 degrees, now insisting on a powerful Mahleresque orchestral score. Takemitsu responded with what many describe as his most romantic effort, one that achieved a perfect blending of Oriental and Occidental sensibilities.\"\nTakemitsu has stated that he was significantly influenced by the Japanese karmic concept of \"ma\", interpreted as a surplus of energy surrounding an abundant void. As Lysy stated: \"Takemitsu was guided in his efforts best summed up in the Japanese word \"ma\", which suggests the incongruity of a void abounding with energy. He related: 'My music is like a garden, and I am the gardener. Listening to my music can be compared with walking through a garden and experiencing the changes in light, pattern and texture.'\"\nThe project was the second of two which allowed Kurosawa and Takemitsu to collaborate, the first being \"Dodes'ka-den\" in 1970. Lysy summarized the second project stating: \"the collaboration between Kurosawa and the temperamental Takemitsu was rocky. Kurosawa constantly sent Takemitsu notes, which only served to infuriate him, so he frequently visited the set to gain a direct sensual experience. Takemitsu actually resigned... Fortunately, producer Masato Hara intervened, made peace, and Takemitsu returned to the film. Years later, Takemitsu would relate: \"Overall, I still have this feeling of\u00a0... 'Oh, if only he'd left more up to me'\u00a0... But seeing it now\u00a0... I guess it's fine the way it is.'\"\nKurosawa originally had wanted the London Symphony Orchestra to perform the score for \"Ran\", but upon meeting conductor Hiroyuki Iwaki of the Sapporo Symphony Orchestra, he engaged Iwaki and the orchestra to record it. Kurosawa had the orchestra play up to 40 takes of the music. The running time of the soundtrack is just over an hour and was re-released in 2016 after its original release in 1985 by Silva Screen Productions. It was produced by Reynold da Silva and David Stoner.\nReception.\nBox office.\nReleased on June 1, 1985, the film was modestly successful financially in Japan. It earned \u00a5 ($12 million) in Japan, just enough to break even. In France, where it released on 18 September 1985, the film sold 813,081 tickets, grossing an estimated F ($).\nIn the United States, where it released in December 1985, the film grossed $3,763,760 in its first four weeks of release. Later re-releases between 2000 and 2016 grossed $528,357 in the United States and Canada, bringing its total North American gross to $.\nIn Germany, where it released in 1986, the film sold 222,862 tickets, grossing an estimated ($714,912). The film also grossed $18,692 in the United Kingdom, and $16,215 in Portugal, bringing the film's total estimated gross to approximately $ worldwide.\nCritical reviews.\n\"Ran\" was critically acclaimed upon its premiere. On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 96%, based on 89 reviews, and an average rating of 9/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \"Akira Kurosawa's sprawling, epic take on \"King Lear\" should be required viewing for fans of westerns, war movies, or period films in general.\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 97 out of 100, based on 21 critics, indicating \"universal acclaim\".\nShawn Levy, of the \"Portland Oregonian\" wrote, \"In many respects, it's Kurosawa's most sumptuous film, a feast of color, motion and sound: Considering that its brethren include \"Kagemusha\", \"Seven Samurai\" and \"Dersu Uzala\", the achievement is extraordinary.\" Writing for the \"Chicago Sun-Times\", Roger Ebert said, \"\"Ran\" is a great, glorious achievement.\" In the \"San Francisco Examiner\", G. Allen Johnson stated: \"Kurosawa pulled out all the stops with \"Ran\", his obsession with loyalty and his love of expressionistic film techniques allowed to roam freely.\"\nWriting for the \"San Francisco Chronicle\", Bob Graham stated: \"In \"Ran\", the horrors of life are transformed by art into beauty. It is finally so moving that the only appropriate response is silence.\" Gene Siskel, writing for the \"Chicago Tribune\", wrote: \"The physical scale of \"Ran\" is overwhelming. It's almost as if Kurosawa is saying to all the cassette buyers of America, in a play on Clint Eastwood's phrase, 'Go ahead, ruin your night' \u2013 wait to see my film on a small screen and cheat yourself out of what a movie can be.\" Vincent Canby, writing for \"The New York Times\", stated: \"Though big in physical scope and of a beauty that suggests a kind of drunken, barbaric lyricism, \"Ran\" has the terrible logic and clarity of a morality tale seen in tight close-up, of a myth that, while being utterly specific and particular in its time and place, remains ageless, infinitely adaptable.\"\nRoger Ebert awarded the film four out of four stars, with extended commentary, \"Kurosawa (while directing \"Ran\") often must have associated himself with the old lord as he tried to put this film together, but in the end he has triumphed, and the image I have of him, at 75, is of three arrows bundled together.\" In 2000, it was inducted into Ebert's Great Movies list.\nNotoriously acerbic critic John Simon of the \"National Review\" wrote, \"I find it as an almost total failure by a genius in his old age\".\nMichal Sragow, writing for \"Salon\" in 2000, summarized the Shakespearean origins of the play: \"Kurosawa's Lear is a 16th century warlord who has three sons and a career studded with conquests. Kurosawa's genius is to tell his story so that every step suggests how wild and savage a journey it has been. At the start, this bold, dominating figure, now called Hidetora, is a sacred monster who wants to be a sort of warlord emeritus. He hopes to bequeath power to his oldest son while retaining his own entourage and emblems of command. He hasn't reckoned with the ambition of his successor or the manipulative skill of his heir's wife, who goes for the sexual and political jugular of anyone who invades her sphere.\" In 2009, the film was voted at No. 59 on the list of \"The Greatest Japanese Films of All Time\" by Japanese film magazine Kinema Junpo.\nAccolades.\n\"Ran\" was completed too late to be entered at Cannes and had its premiere at Japan's first Tokyo International Film Festival. Kurosawa skipped the film's premiere, angering many in the Japanese film industry. As a result, it was not submitted as Japan's entry for the Best Foreign Language Film category of the Oscars. Serge Silberman tried to get it nominated as a French co-production but failed. However, American director Sidney Lumet helped organize a campaign to have Kurosawa nominated as Best Director.\n\"Ran\" was nominated for the Academy Awards for art direction, cinematography, costume design (which it won), and Kurosawa's direction. It was also nominated for a Golden Globe for Best Foreign Language Film. In Japan, \"Ran\" was conspicuously not nominated for \"Best Picture\" at the Awards of the Japanese Academy. However, it won two prizes, for best art direction and best music score, and received four other nominations, for best cinematography, best lighting, best sound, and best supporting actor (Hitoshi Ueki, who played Saburo's patron, Lord Fujimaki). \"Ran\" won two awards from the British Academy of Film and Television Arts, for best foreign language film and best make-up artist, and was nominated for best cinematography, best costume design, best production design, and best screenplay\u2013adapted. Despite its limited commercial success at the time of its release, the film's accolades have improved greatly, and it is now regarded as one of Kurosawa's masterpieces.\n\"Ran\" won Best Director and Best Foreign Film awards from the National Board of Review, a Best Film award and a Best Cinematography award (Takao Sait\u014d, Sh\u014dji Ueda, and Asakazu Nakai) from the National Society of Film Critics, a Best Foreign Language Film award from the New York Film Critics Circle, a Best Music award (Toru Takemitsu) and a Best Foreign Film award from the Los Angeles Film Critics Association, a Best Film award and a Best Cinematography award from the Boston Society of Film Critics, a Best Foreign Feature award from the Amanda Awards from Norway, a Blue Ribbon Award for Best Film, a Best European Film award from the Bodil Awards, a Best Foreign Director award from the David di Donatello Awards, a Joseph Plateau Award for Best Artistic Contribution, a Director of the Year award and a Foreign Language Film of the Year award from the London Critics Circle Film Awards, a Best Film, a Best Supporting Actor (Hisashi Igawa) and a Best Director from the Mainichi Film Concours, and an OCIC award from the San Sebastian Film Festival.\nIn the British Film Institute's 2002 \"Sight &amp; Sound\" polls of the greatest films ever made, \"Ran\" ranked 41st in director's poll. In 2007, the film was ranked at No. 28 by \"The Guardian\"'s readers' poll on its list of \"40 greatest foreign films of all time\". The film was selected in BBC's list of 100 greatest foreign language films by 209 critics of 43 countries around the world in 2018.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "75985", "revid": "50659161", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=75985", "title": "Henry III of France", "text": "King of France from 1574 to 1589\nHenry III (; ; ; 19 September 1551\u00a0\u2013 2 August 1589) was King of France from 1574 until his assassination in 1589 and, as Henry of Valois, King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania from 1573 to 1575.\nAs the fourth son of King Henry II of France and Queen Catherine de' Medici, he was not expected to inherit the French throne and thus was a good candidate for the vacant throne of the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth, where he was elected monarch in 1573. During his brief rule, he refused to sign the Henrician Articles into law, which would recognise the szlachta's right to freely elect their monarch. The Henrician Articles became, nonetheless, deeply rooted in Poland's politics as all his successors accepted them. Aged 22, Henry abandoned Poland\u2013Lithuania upon inheriting the French throne when his brother, Charles IX, died without issue.\nFrance was at the time plagued by the Wars of Religion, and Henry's authority was undermined by violent political factions funded by foreign powers: the Catholic League (supported by Spain and the Pope), the Protestant Huguenots (supported by England and the Dutch) and the Malcontents (led by Henry's own brother Francis, Duke of Anjou and Alen\u00e7on, a party of Catholic and Protestant aristocrats who jointly opposed the absolutist ambitions of the king). Henry III was himself a , arguing that only a strong and centralised yet religiously tolerant monarchy would save France from collapse.\nAfter the death of Henry's younger brother Francis, Duke of Anjou, and when it became apparent that Henry would not father an heir, the Wars of Religion developed into a dynastic war known as the War of the Three Henrys. Under Salic Law, Henry III's heir apparent was his distant cousin, King Henry III of Navarre, a Protestant. The Catholic League, led by Henry I, Duke of Guise, demanded the exclusion of all Protestant heirs from the line of succession. They instead championed the Catholic Charles, Cardinal of Bourbon, as Henry III's heir presumptive.\nHenry had the Duke of Guise murdered in 1588 and was in turn assassinated by Jacques Cl\u00e9ment, a Catholic League fanatic, in 1589. He was succeeded by the King of Navarre who, as Henry IV, assumed the throne of France as the first king of the House of Bourbon and eventually converted to Catholicism.\nEarly life.\nChildhood.\nHenry was born at the royal Ch\u00e2teau de Fontainebleau, as Alexandre \u00c9douard, duc de Angoul\u00eame, the fourth son of King Henry II and Catherine de' Medici. He was a grandson of Francis I of France and Claude of France. His older brothers were Francis II of France, Charles IX of France, and Louis of Valois. He was made Duke of Angoul\u00eame and Duke of Orl\u00e9ans in 1560, then Duke of Anjou in 1566.\nHe was his mother's favourite; she called him \"chers yeux\" (\"precious eyes\") and lavished fondness and affection upon him for most of his life. His elder brother, Charles, grew to detest him, partially because he resented his better health.\nThe royal children were raised under the supervision of Diane de Poitiers, his father's mistress.\nYouth.\nAlthough he was skilled and fond of fencing, he preferred to indulge his tastes for the arts and reading. These predilections were attributed to his Italian mother. Henry's favourite interests were hunting and riding.\nAt one point in his youth Henry showed a tendency towards Protestantism as a means of rebelling. At the age of nine, he called himself \"a little Huguenot\", attended Mass only to please his mother, sang Protestant psalms to his sister Margaret (exhorting her all the while to change her religion and cast her Book of Hours into the fire), and even bit the nose off a statue of Saint Paul. His mother firmly cautioned him against such behaviour, and he would never again show any Protestant tendencies. Instead, he became staunchly Catholic.\nIn the factional dispute that engulfed France in the wake of Henry II's death in 1559, Henry was solicited by Henry, son of Francis, Duke of Guise, at the behest of Jacques, Duke of Nemours, to run away from court to be a figurehead for the ultra-Catholics. However, the plot was uncovered before any action could be taken.\nHenry was known as a flaneur, who relished leisurely strolls through Paris and partook in the sociability in the busiest of neighbourhoods. He revelled in fairs, music, bilboquet and court masques. His extravagance in court entertainments cut him off from the common people. He was also a devout Catholic who introduced pious reforms into the city and he encouraged the French church to follow the edicts of the Council of Trent.\nSexuality.\nReports that Henry engaged in same-sex relations with his court favourites, known as the \"mignons,\" date back to his own time. He was known to have enjoyed intense relationships with them. The scholar Louis Crompton maintains that all of the contemporary rumours about Henry were true. However, some modern historians have disputed this: Jean-Francois Solnon, Nicolas Le Roux, and Jacqueline Boucher have noted that Henry had many famous mistresses, that he was well known for his taste in beautiful women, and that no male sex partners have been identified. They concluded that the idea he was homosexual was promoted by his political opponents (both Protestant and Catholic) who used his dislike of war to depict him as effeminate and undermine his reputation with the French people. The portrait of a self-indulgent homosexual incapable of fathering an heir to the throne proved useful in efforts by the Catholic League to secure the succession for Cardinal Charles de Bourbon after 1585. Robert Knecht maintained that the \"mignons\" themselves were \"not homosexuals\" either, \"as is often assumed. Far from being effeminate, they were skilful swordsmen, who risked their lives in duels.\"\nHowever, French Renaissance scholar Gary Ferguson considers such interpretations to be unconvincing: \"It is difficult to reconcile the king whose use of favourites is so logically strategic with the man who goes to pieces when one of them dies.\" Katherine Crawford, by contrast, emphasizes the problems Henry's reputation encountered because of his failure to produce an heir and the presence of his powerful mother at court, combined with his enemies' insistence on conflating patronage with favouritism and luxury with decadence.\nElizabeth.\nIn 1570, discussions commenced arranging for Henry to court Queen Elizabeth I of England. Elizabeth, almost 37, was expected by many parties in her country to marry and produce an heir. However, nothing came of these discussions. In initiating them, Elizabeth is viewed by historians as having intended only to arouse the concern of Spain, rather than contemplate marriage seriously. Henry's mother felt the chance of marriage despite differing religious views (Henry was Catholic, Elizabeth Protestant) simply required personal sacrifice. Henry tactlessly referred to Elizabeth as a (\"public whore\") and made ridiculous remarks about their difference in age (he was 18 years younger at a time when such large age differences between spouses were not at all uncommon).\nWars of Religion.\nIn November 1567, upon the death of Anne de Montmorency, Henry assumed the role of Lieutenant-General of France, placing him in nominal control of France's military. Henry served as a leader of the royal army, taking part in the victories over the Huguenots at the Battle of Jarnac (March 1569) and at the Battle of Moncontour (October 1569). At this time he was a rallying point for the ultra-Catholics at court, who saw him as an opposition figure to the tolerant line being taken by the King, with Charles, Cardinal of Lorraine guiding his council. Lorraine offered him 200,000 Francs of Church revenue to become a protector of Catholicism, and tried to arrange his marriage to Mary, Queen of Scots; however neither project took off.\nWhile still Duke of Anjou, he helped plot the St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre of 1572. Though Henry did not participate directly, historian sees him as the royal most responsible for the massacre, which involved the targeted killing of many Huguenot leaders. Henry III's reign as King of France, like those of his elder brothers Francis and Charles, would see France in constant turmoil over religion.\nHenry continued to take an active role in the Wars of Religion, and in 1572/1573 led the siege of La Rochelle, a massive military assault on the Huguenot-held city. At the end of May 1573, Henry learned that the Polish \"szlachta\" had elected him King of Poland (a country with a large Protestant minority at the time) and political considerations forced him to negotiate an end to the siege. Negotiators reached an agreement on 24 June 1573, and Catholic troops ended the siege on 6 July 1573.\nKing of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania (1574\u20131575).\nFollowing the death of the Polish ruler Sigismund II Augustus on 7 July 1572, Jean de Monluc was sent as the French envoy to Poland to negotiate the election of Henry to the Polish throne in exchange for military support against Russia, diplomatic assistance in dealing with the Ottoman Empire, and financial subsidies. Charles IX allowed Henry's envoys to give up to 50,000 \u00e9cus to important people in Poland-Lithuania as a bribe, but this would increase to 100,000 each.\nOn 16 May 1573, Polish nobles chose Henry as the first elected monarch of the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth. The Lithuanian nobles boycotted this election, however, and it was left to the Lithuanian ducal council to confirm his election. The commonwealth elected Henry, rather than Habsburg candidates, partly in order to be more agreeable to the Ottoman Empire (a traditional ally of France through the Franco-Ottoman alliance) and strengthen a Polish-Ottoman alliance that was in effect. In addition to this, Henry was not a powerful ruler in his own right, as he was only a Prince, nor did France border the Commonwealth, so he wouldn't have the capacity to strip the Polish Nobility of their historic rights.\nA Polish delegation went to La Rochelle to meet with Henry, who was leading the Siege of La Rochelle. Henry left the siege following their visit. In Paris, on 10 September, the Polish delegation asked Henry to take an oath, at Notre Dame Cathedral, to \"respect traditional Polish liberties and the law on religious freedom that had been passed during the interregnum\". As a condition of his election, he was compelled to sign the \"pacta conventa\" and the Henrician Articles, pledging religious tolerance in the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth. Henry chafed at the restrictions on monarchic power under the Polish-Lithuanian political system of \"Golden Liberty\". The Polish-Lithuanian parliament had been urged by Anna Jagiellon, the sister of the recently deceased king Sigismund II Augustus, to elect him based on the understanding that Henry would wed Anna afterward.\nAt a ceremony before the Parlement of Paris on 13 September, the Polish delegation handed over the \"certificate of election to the throne of Poland-Lithuania\". Henry also gave up any claims to succession and he \"recognized the principle of free election\" under the Henrician Articles and the \"pacta conventa\".\nIt was not until January 1574 that Henry was to reach the borders of Poland. On 21 February, Henry's coronation was held in Krak\u00f3w. In mid-June 1574, upon learning of the death of his brother Charles IX, Henry left Poland and headed back to France. Henry's absence provoked a constitutional crisis that the Parliament attempted to resolve by notifying Henry that his throne would be lost if he did not return from France by 12 May 1575. His failure to return caused Parliament to declare his throne vacant.\nThe short reign of Henry at Wawel Castle in Poland was marked by a clash of cultures between the Polish and the French. The young king and his followers were astonished by several Polish practices and disappointed by the rural poverty and harsh climate of the country. The Poles, on the other hand, wondered if all Frenchmen were as concerned with their appearance as their new king appeared to be.\nIn many aspects, Polish culture had a positive influence on France. At Wawel, the French were introduced to new technologies of septic facilities, in which litter (excrement) was taken outside the castle walls. On returning to France, Henry wanted to order the construction of such facilities at the Louvre and other palaces. Other inventions introduced to the French by the Polish included a bath with regulated hot and cold water as well as dining forks.\nIn 1578, Henry created the Order of the Holy Spirit to commemorate his becoming first King of Poland and later King of France on the Feast of Pentecost and gave it precedence over the earlier Order of St. Michael, which had lost much of its original prestige by being awarded too frequently and too readily. The Order would retain its prestige as the premier chivalric order of France until the end of the French monarchy.\nFrench reign (1574\u20131589).\nHenry was crowned king of France on 13 February 1575 at Reims Cathedral. Although he was expected to produce an heir after he married the 21-year-old Louise of Lorraine on 14 February 1575, no issue resulted from their union.\nIn 1574, Henry renewed letters that gave Portuguese New Christians the right of settling in France.\nIn 1576, Henry signed the Edict of Beaulieu, which granted many concessions to the Huguenots. His action resulted in Henry I, Duke of Guise, forming the Catholic League. After much posturing and negotiations, Henry was forced to rescind most of the concessions that had been made to the Protestants in the edict.\nAfter 1582, Henry became convinced of the need for fiscal reform to break the cycle of expedients upon which he had relied. To this end he summoned an Assembly of Notables which met from November 1583 to February 1584. While he failed to convince them of his most radical tax plans, the notables forwarded a series of proposals to him which would be embodied in his legislation during 1584. As a result of these policies the royal budget was almost balanced in 1585, before it was subject to political shock.\nIn 1584, the king's youngest brother and heir presumptive, Francis, Duke of Anjou, died. Under Salic Law, the next heir to the throne was Protestant Henry of Navarre, a descendant of Louis IX (Saint Louis). The possibility of a Protestant on the throne led to the War of the Three Henrys. Under pressure from the duke of Guise, Henry III issued an edict suppressing Protestantism and annulling Henry of Navarre's right to the throne.\nHenry III, stung by the open disobedience of Guise, attempted a coup in May 1588 and sent royal Swiss troops into several neighbourhoods. This had the unintended effect of rallying the people against him and in favor of the more popular Guise during the Day of the Barricades. Henry III fled the city; he later sought support from the Parlement of Paris and propped up an anti-League establishment throughout France.\nFollowing the defeat of the Spanish Armada that summer, the king's fear of Spanish support for the Catholic League apparently waned. Accordingly, on 23 December 1588, at the Ch\u00e2teau of Blois, he invited Guise to the council chamber where the duke's brother Louis II, Cardinal of Guise, already waited. The duke was told that the king wished to see him in the private room adjoining the royal bedroom. There, royal guardsmen murdered the duke, then the cardinal. To make certain that no contender for the French throne was free to act against him, the king had the duke's son imprisoned. The duke of Guise had been very popular in France, and the citizenry turned against Henry for the murders. The Parlement instituted criminal charges against the king, and he was compelled to join forces with his heir, the Protestant Henry of Navarre, by setting up the Parliament of Tours.\nBy 1589 Henry's popularity hit a new low. Preachers were calling for his assassination and labelling him a tyrant. The people of Paris disdained him for his court extravagances, allowing corruption to grow rife, high taxes and having relied extensively on Italian financiers. But what most Parisians hated most about him was his alleged sexuality.\nOverseas relations.\nUnder Henry, France named Guillaume B\u00e9rard as the first Consul of France in Morocco. The request came from the Moroccan prince Abd al-Malik, who had been saved by B\u00e9rard, a doctor by profession, during an epidemic in Constantinople and wished to retain B\u00e9rard in his service.\nHenry III encouraged the exploration and development of New World territories. In 1588, he granted Jacques No\u00ebl, the nephew of Jacques Cartier, privileges over fishing, fur trading, and mining in New France.\nDeath.\nOn 1 August 1589, Henry III lodged with his army at Saint-Cloud, and was preparing to attack Paris, when a young fanatical Dominican friar, Jacques Cl\u00e9ment, carrying false papers, was granted access to deliver important documents to the king. The friar gave the king a bundle of papers and stated that he had a secret message to deliver. The king signaled for his attendants to step back for privacy, and Cl\u00e9ment whispered in his ear while plunging a knife into his abdomen. Cl\u00e9ment was then killed on the spot by the guards.\nAt first, the king's wound did not appear fatal, but he enjoined all the officers around him, in case he did not survive, to be loyal to Henry of Navarre as their new king. The following morning, on the day that he was to have launched his assault to retake Paris, Henry III died.\nChaos swept the attacking army, most of it quickly melting away; the proposed attack on Paris was postponed. Inside the city, joy at the news of Henry III's death was near delirium; some hailed the assassination as an act of God.\nBurial.\nHenry III was interred at the Saint Denis Basilica. Childless, he was the longest-living of Henry II's sons to have become king and also the last of the Valois kings. Henry III of Navarre succeeded him as Henry IV, the first of the kings of the House of Bourbon.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nWorks cited.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Computer programs such as Radiance allow an architect or engineer to quickly calculate benefits of a particular design. The human eye's response to light is non-linear, so a more even distribution of the same amount of light makes a room appear brighter.\nThe source of all daylight is the Sun. The proportion of direct to diffuse light impacts the amount and quality of daylight. \"Direct sunlight\" reaches a site without being scattered within Earth's atmosphere. Sunlight that is scattered in the atmosphere is \"diffused daylight\". Sunlight reflected off walls and the ground also contributes to daylighting. Each climate has different composition of these daylights and different cloud coverage, so daylighting strategies vary with site locations and climates. At latitudes north of the Tropic of Cancer and south of the Tropic of Capricorn, there is no direct sunlight on the polar-side wall of a building between the autumnal equinox and the vernal equinox (that is, from the September equinox to the March equinox in the Northern Hemisphere, and from the March equinox to the September equinox in the Southern Hemisphere.) In the Northern Hemisphere, the north-facing wall is the \"polar-side\" and in the Southern Hemisphere, it is the south-facing wall.\nTraditionally, houses were designed with minimal windows on the polar side, but more and larger windows on the equatorial side (south-facing wall in the Northern Hemisphere and north-facing wall in the Southern Hemisphere). Equatorial-side windows receive at least some direct sunlight on any sunny day of the year (except in the tropics in summer), so they are effective at daylighting areas of the house adjacent to the windows. At higher latitudes during midwinter, light incidence is highly directional and casts long shadows. This may be partially ameliorated through light diffusion, light pipes or tubes, and through somewhat reflective internal surfaces. At fairly low latitudes in summertime, windows that face east and west and sometimes those that face toward the nearer pole receive more sunlight than windows facing toward the equator.\nTypes.\nPassive daylighting is a system of both collecting sunlight using static, non-moving, and non-tracking systems (such as windows, sliding glass doors, most skylights, light tubes) and reflecting the collected daylight deeper inside with elements such as light shelves. Passive daylighting systems are different from active daylighting systems in that active systems track and/or follow the sun, and rely on mechanical mechanisms to do so.\nWindows.\nWindows are the most common way to admit daylight into a space. Their vertical orientation means that they selectively admit sunlight and diffuse daylight at different times of the day and year. Therefore, windows on multiple orientations must usually be combined to produce the right mix of light for the building, depending on the climate and latitude. There are three ways to improve the amount of light available from a window:&lt;ref name=\"Building for Energy Independence: Sun/Earth Buffering and Superinsulation\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; (a) placing the window close to a light colored wall, (b) slanting the sides of window openings so the inner opening is larger than the outer opening, or (c) using a large light colored window-sill to project light into the room. Besides permitting daylighting into the building, windows serve another function in daylighting practice, providing views out. To enhance the quality of the view seen from a window, three primary variables need to be ensure: view content (what can be seen in the view), view access (how much of the window view can be seen), and view clarity (how clearly the view can be seen). View clarity is often influenced by the amount of shading provided by blinds or devices used to protect occupants from harsh daylight (e.g. glare) or for reasons of visual privacy. Environmental criteria serve as important criteria to gauge the quality of window view content. These criteria can be distilled into five important factors, namely: Location, time, weather, people, and nature. Notably, views that are able to provide building inhabitants with content of nature far outweigh the other four Environmental Information Criteria.\nDifferent types and grades of glass and different window treatments can also affect the amount of light transmission through the windows. The type of glazing is an important issue, expressed by its VT coefficient (Visual Transmittance), also known as visual light transmittance (VLT). As the name suggests, this coefficient measures how much visible light is admitted by the window. A low VT (below 0.4) can reduce by half or more the light coming into a room. But be also aware of high VT glass: high VT numbers (say, above 0.60) can be a cause of glare. On the other hand, you should also take into account the undesirable effects of large windows.\nWindows grade into translucent walls (below).\nClerestory windows.\nAnother important element in creating daylighting is the use of clerestory windows. These are high, vertically placed windows. They can be used to increase direct solar gain when oriented towards the equator. When facing toward the sun, clerestories and other windows may admit unacceptable glare. In the case of a passive solar house, clerestories may provide a direct light path to polar-side (north in the northern hemisphere; south in the southern hemisphere) rooms that otherwise would not be illuminated. Alternatively, clerestories can be used to admit diffuse daylight (from the north in the northern hemisphere) that evenly illuminates a space such as a classroom or office.\nOften, clerestory windows also shine onto interior wall surfaces painted white or another light color. These walls are placed so as to reflect indirect light to interior areas where it is needed. This method has the advantage of reducing the directionality of light to make it softer and more diffuse, reducing shadows.\nSawtooth roof.\nAnother roof-angled glass alternative is a sawtooth roof (found on older factories). Sawtooth roofs have vertical roof glass facing away from the equator side of the building to capture diffused light (not harsh direct equator-side solar gain). The angled portion of the glass-support structure is opaque and well insulated with a cool roof and radiant barrier. The sawtooth roof's lighting concept partially reduces the summer \"solar furnace\" skylight problem, but still allows warm interior air to rise and touch the exterior roof glass in the cold winter, with significant undesirable heat transfer.\nSkylights.\nA skylight or rooflight is a light-permitting structure or window, usually of transparent or translucent glass, that forms part (or all) of the roof area of a building for daylighting or ventilation.\nLaylights.\nAs an element of architecture, a laylight is a glazed panel usually set flush with the ceiling for the purpose of admitting natural or artificial light. Laylights typically utilize stained glass or lenses in their glazing, but can also use alternative materials. For example, the Lyme Art Association Gallery utilizes translucent white muslin laylights below its skylights. A laylight differs from a glazed (or closed) skylight in that a skylight functions as a roof window or aperture, while a laylight is flush with the ceiling of an interior space. When paired with a roof lantern or skylight on a sloped roof, a laylight functions as an interior light diffuser. Before the advent of electric lighting, laylights allowed transmission of light between floors in larger buildings, and were not always paired with skylights.\nAtrium.\nAn atrium is a large open space located within a building. It is often used to light a central circulation or public area by daylight admitted through a glass roof or wall. Atria provide some daylight to adjacent working areas, but the amount is often small and does not penetrate very far. The main function of an atrium is to provide a visual experience and a degree of contact with the outside for people in the working areas. The daylighting of successive storeys of rooms adjoining an atrium is interdependent and requires a balanced approach. Light from the sky can easily penetrate the upper storeys but not the lower, which rely primarily on light reflected from internal surfaces of the atrium such as floor-reflected light. The upper stories need less window area than the lower ones, and if the atrium walls are light in color the upper walls will reflect light toward the lower stories.\nTranslucent walls.\nWalls made of glass brick are translucent-to-transparent. Traditionally they are hollow and grouted with a fine concrete grout, but some modern glass brick walls are solid cast glass grouted with a transparent glue. If the glue matches the refractive index of the glass, the wall can be fairly transparent.\nIncreasing the amount of concrete, bottle walls embed bottles that run right through the wall, transmitting light. Concrete walls with glass prisms running through them have also been made. With the advent of cheaper optical fibers and fiber-optic concrete walls, daylight (and shadow images) can then pass directly through a solid concrete wall, making it translucent; fiber optics will lead light around bends and over tens of meters. Typically only a few percent of the light is transmitted (the percent transmittance is about half the percent of the surface that is fibers, and usually only ~5% fibers are used).\nBoth glass and concrete conduct heat fairly well, when solid, so none of these walls insulate well. They are therefore often used outdoors, as a divider between two heated spaces (see images), or in very temperate climates.\nGreenhouse walls (and roofs) are made to transmit as much light and as little heat as possible. They use a variety of materials, and may be transparent or translucent.\nRemote distribution.\nIt is possible to provide some daylight into spaces that have low possibility of windows or skylights through remote distribution devices such as mirrors, prisms, or light tubes. This is called anidolic lighting, from anidolic (non-image-forming) optics. The non-linear response of the human eye to light means that spreading light to a broader area of a room makes the room appear brighter, and makes more of it usefully lit.\nRemote daylight distribution systems have losses, and the further they have to transmit the daylight and the more convoluted the path, the greater the inefficiency. The efficiency of many remote distribution systems can also vary dramatically from clear to overcast skies. Nonetheless, where there is no other possibility of providing daylight to a space, remote distribution systems can be appreciated.\nLight reflectors and shelves.\nOnce used extensively in office buildings, the manually adjustable light reflector is seldom in use today having been supplanted by a combination of other methods in concert with artificial illumination. The reflector had found favor where the choices of artificial light provided poor illumination compared to modern electric lighting.\nLight shelves are an effective way to enhance the lighting from windows on the equator-facing side of a structure, this effect being obtained by placing a white or reflective metal light shelf outside the window. Usually the window will be protected from direct summer season sun by a projecting eave. The light shelf projects beyond the shadow created by the eave and reflects sunlight upward to illuminate the ceiling. This reflected light can contain little heat content and the reflective illumination from the ceiling will typically reduce deep shadows, reducing the need for general illumination.\nIn the cold winter, a natural light shelf is created when there is snow on the ground which makes it reflective. Low winter sun (see Sun path) reflects off the snow and increases solar gain through equator-facing glass by one- to two-thirds which brightly lights the ceiling of these rooms. Glare control (drapes) may be required.\nPrisms.\nThe oldest use of prisms for daylighting may well be deck prisms, let into the decks of ships to transmit light below. Later, pavement lights or vault lights were used to light basement areas under sidewalks.\nPrisms that used total internal reflection to throw light sideways, lighting the deeper portions of a room, later became popular. Early thick, slow-cooling cast glass prism tiles were often known as \"luxfer tiles\" after a major manufacturer. They were and are used in the upper portions of windows, and some believe that they contributed to the trend from dark, subdivided Victorian interiors to open-plan, light-coloured ones.\nDaylight redirecting window film (DRF) is a thin plastic version of the old glass prism tiles. It can be used as a substitute for opaque blinds.\nLight tubes.\nAnother type of device used is the light tube, also called a tubular daylighting device (TDD), which is placed into a roof and admits light to a focused area of the interior. These somewhat resemble recessed ceiling light fixtures. They do not allow as much heat transfer as skylights because they have less surface area.\nTDDs use modern technology to transmit visible light through opaque walls and roofs. The tube itself is a passive component consisting of either a simple reflective interior coating or a light conducting fiber optic bundle. It is frequently capped with a transparent, roof-mounted dome \"light collector\" and terminated with a diffuser assembly that admits the daylight into interior spaces and distributes the available light energy evenly (or else efficiently if the use of the lit space is reasonably fixed, and the user desired one or more \"bright-spots\").\nThe tubular daylighting device was invented by Solatube International in 1986 and brought to market first in Australia in 1991.\nActive daylighting.\nActive daylighting is a system of collecting sunlight using a mechanical device to increase the efficiency of light collection for a given lighting purpose. Active daylighting systems are different from passive daylighting systems in that passive systems are stationary and do not actively follow or track the sun. There are two types of active daylighting control systems: closed loop solar tracking, and open loop solar tracking systems.\nSmart glass.\nSmart glass is the name given to a class of materials and devices that can be switched between a transparent state and a state which is opaque, translucent, reflective, or retro-reflective. The switching is done by applying a voltage to the material, or by performing some simple mechanical operation. Windows, skylights, etc., that are made of smart glass can be used to adjust indoor lighting, compensating for changes of the brightness of the light outdoors and of the required brightness indoors.\nSolar lighting.\nHeliostats.\nThe use of heliostats, mirrors which are moved automatically to reflect sunlight in a constant direction as the sun moves across the sky, is gaining popularity as an energy-efficient method of lighting. A heliostat can be used to shine sunlight directly through a window or skylight, or into any arrangement of optical elements, such as light tubes, that distribute the light where it is needed. The image shows a mirror that rotates on a computer-controlled, motor-driven altazimuth mount.\nSolar street lights.\nSolar street lights raised light sources which are powered by photovoltaic panels generally mounted on the lighting structure. The solar array of such off-grid PV system charges a rechargeable battery, which powers a fluorescent or LED lamp during the night. Solar street lights are stand-alone power systems, and have the advantage of savings on trenching, landscaping, and maintenance costs, as well as on the electric bills, despite their higher initial cost compared to conventional street lighting. They are designed with sufficiently large batteries to ensure operation for at least a week and even in the worst situation, they are expected to dim only slightly.\nHybrid solar lighting.\nOak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) has developed a new alternative to skylights called hybrid solar lighting. This design uses a roof-mounted light collector, large-diameter optical fiber, and modified efficient fluorescent lighting fixtures that have transparent rods connected to the optical fiber cables. Essentially no electricity is needed for daytime natural interior lighting.\nField tests conducted in 2006 and 2007 of the new HSL technology were promising, but the low-volume equipment production is still expensive. HSL should become more cost effective in the near future. A version that can withstand windstorms could begin to replace conventional commercial fluorescent lighting systems with improved implementations in 2008 and beyond. The U.S. 2007 Energy Bill provides funding for HSL R&amp;D, and multiple large commercial buildings are ready to fund further HSL application development and deployment.\nAt night, ORNL HSL uses variable-intensity fluorescent lighting electronic control ballasts. As the sunlight gradually decreases at sunset, the fluorescent fixture is gradually turned up to give a near-constant level of interior lighting from daylight until after it becomes dark outside.\nHSL may soon become an option for commercial interior lighting. It can transmit about half of the direct sunlight it receives.\nSolarium.\nIn a well-designed isolated solar gain building with a solarium, sunroom, greenhouse, etc., there is usually significant glass on the equator side. A large area of glass can also be added between the sun room and the interior living quarters. Low-cost, high-volume-produced patio door safety glass is an inexpensive way to accomplish this goal.\nThe doors used to enter a room should be opposite the sun room interior glass, so that a user can see outside immediately when entering most rooms. Halls should be minimized with open spaces used instead. If a hall is necessary for privacy or room isolation, inexpensive patio door safety glass can be placed on both sides of the hall. Drapes over the interior glass can be used to control lighting. Drapes can optionally be automated with sensor-based electric motor controls that are aware of room occupancy, daylight, interior temperature, and time of day. Passive solar buildings with no central air conditioning system need control mechanisms for hourly, daily, and seasonal, temperature-and-daylight variations. If the temperature is correct, and a room is unoccupied, the drapes can automatically close to reduce heat transfer in either direction.\nTo help distribute sun room daylight to the sides of rooms that are farthest from the equator, inexpensive ceiling-to-floor mirrors can be used.\nBuilding codes require a second means of egress, in case of fire. Most designers use a door on one side of bedrooms, and an outside window, but west-side windows provide very-poor summer thermal performance. Instead of a west-facing window, designers use an R-13 foam-filled solid energy-efficient exterior door. It may have a glass storm door on the outside so that light can pass through when the inner door is opened. East/west glass doors and windows should be fully shaded top-to-bottom or a spectrally selective coating can be used to reduce solar gain.\nDesign.\nArchitects and interior designers often use daylighting as a design element. Good daylighting requires attention to both qualitative and quantitative aspects of design.\nQualitative.\nUtilizing natural light is one of the design aspects in architecture; In 1929, the French architect, Le Corbusier said that \"The history of architectural material... has been the endless struggle for light... in other words, the history of windows.\" As he emphasized in his architecture (such as Notre Dame du Haut), daylighting has been a major architectural design element (See MIT Chapel and Church of the Light for examples). Not only the aesthetic aspects, the impact of daylighting on human health and work performance is also considered as qualitative daylighting. The current studies show that lighting conditions in workplaces contribute to a variety of factors related to work satisfaction, productivity and well-being and significantly higher visual acceptance scores under daylighting than electrical lighting. Studies have also shown that light has a direct effect on human health because of the way it influences the circadian rhythms.\nQuantitative.\nA well daylit space needs both adequate lighting levels and light that is well distributed. In the current building industry, daylighting is considered a building performance measure in green building certification programs such as LEED. Illuminating Engineering Society (IES) and the society of Light and Lighting (SLL) provide illuminance recommendation for each space type. How much daylighting contributes to the recommended lighting level determines daylighting performance of a building. There are two metrics that IES has approved to evaluate daylighting performance: Spatial Daylight Autonomy(sDA) and Annual Sunlight Exposure (ASE). sDA is a metric describing annual sufficiency of ambient daylight levels in interior environments. See Daylight autonomy and LEED documentation sections for more details.\nEvaluation method.\nField measurements.\nIn existing buildings, field measurements can be undertaken to evaluate daylighting performance. Illuminance measurements on a grid is a basic level to derive an average illuminance of a space. The spacing of the measurement points vary with project purposes. The height of these points depends on where the primary task is performed. In most office spaces, desk level (0.762m above the floor) will be measured. Based on measurements, average illuminance, maximum-to-minimum uniformity ratio, and average-to-minimum uniformity ratio will be calculated and compared to the recommended lighting level. A diagnostic survey specific to lighting can be conducted to analyse the satisfaction of building occupants.\nComputational simulations.\nComputational simulations can predict daylighting condition of a space much faster and more detailed than hand calculations or scale model testing. The simulations allow for the effects of climate with hourly weather data from typical meteorological year. Computer models are available which can predict variations in internally reflected light. Radiosity and ray-tracing are methods can deal with complex geometry, allow complex sky distributions and potentially produce photorealistic images. Radiosity methods assume all surfaces are perfectly diffusing to reduce computational times. Ray-tracing techniques have accuracy and image rendering capacity.\nDaylighting metrics and analyses.\nDaylight autonomy is the percentage of time that daylight levels are above a specified target illuminance within a physical space or building. The calculation is based on annual data and the predetermined lighting levels. The goal of the calculation is to determine how long an individual can work in a space without requiring electrical lighting, while also providing optimal visual and physical comfort.\nDaylight autonomy is beneficial when determining how daylight enters and illuminates a space. The drawback, however, is that there is no upper limit on luminance levels. Therefore, a space with a high internal heat gain deemed uncomfortable by occupants, would still perform well in the analysis. Achieving daylight autonomy requires an integrated design approach that guides the building form, siting, climate considerations, building components, lighting controls, and lighting design criteria.\nContinuous.\nContinuous daylight autonomy, is similar to daylight autonomy but partial credit is attributed to time steps when the daylight illuminance lies below the minimum illuminance level. For example, if the target illuminance is 400 lux and the calculated value is 200 lux, daylight autonomy would give zero credit, while continuous daylight autonomy would give 0.5 credit (200/400=0.5). The benefit of continuous daylight autonomy is that it does not give a hard threshold of acceptable illuminance. Instead, it addresses the transition area\u2014allowing for realistic preferences within any given space. For example, office occupants usually prefer to work at daylight below the illuminance threshold since this level avoids potential glare and excessive contrast.\nUseful illuminance.\nUseful daylight illuminance focuses on the direct sunlight that falls into a space. The useful daylight illuminance calculation is based on three factors\u2014the percentage of time a point is below, between, or above an illuminance value. The range for these factors is typically 100\u20132,000 lux. Useful daylight illuminance is similar to daylight autonomy but has the added benefit of addressing glare and thermal discomfort. The upper threshold is used to determine when glare or thermal discomfort is occurring and may need resolution.\nIlluminance distribution.\nBesides determining how much illuminance is received on a horizontal surface, a method that analyses annual illuminance distributions for daylight has been developed. Every annual illuminance distribution is compared against each other using principal components analysis. This compares the relationship between each pattern. Daylight patterns that are more similar to each other due to architectural features and the time of the year the illuminance are produced are grouped together. Groups are used to form the most representative patterns for that given building. This method can be used to easily interpret how daylight is spread across the space throughout the entire year in any building.\nLEED documentation.\nThe LEED 2009 daylighting standards were intended to connect building occupants with the outdoors through use of optimal daylighting techniques and technologies. According to these standards, the maximum value of 1 point can be achieved through four different approaches. The first approach is a computer simulation to demonstrate, in clear sky conditions, the daylight illuminance levels 108\u20135,400 lux on, September 21 between 9:00\u00a0a.m. and 3:00\u00a0p.m. Another prescriptive approach is a method that uses two types of side-lighting, and three types of top-lighting to determine if a minimum of 75% daylighting is achieved in the occupied spaces. A third approach uses indoor light measurements showing that between 108 and 5,400 lux have been achieved in the space. The last approach is a combination of the other three calculation methods to prove that the daylight illumination requirements are achieved.\nThe LEED 2009 documentation is based upon the daylight factor calculation. The daylight factor calculation is based on uniform overcast skies. It is most applicable in Northern Europe and parts of North America. Daylight factor is \"the ratio of the illuminance at a point on a plane, generally the horizontal work plane, produced by the luminous flux received directly or indirectly at that point from a sky whose luminance distribution is known, to the illuminance on a horizontal plane produced by an unobstructed hemisphere of this same sky.\"\nLEED v4 daylighting standards are the most current as of 2014. The new standards are similar to the old standards, but also intend to \"reinforce circadian rhythms, and reduce the use of electrical lighting by introducing daylight in the space. Two options exist for achieving the maximum value of these two most recent points. One option is to use a computer simulation to demonstrate that a spatial daylight autonomy of 300 lux for at least 50% of the time, and an annual sunlight exposure of 1,000 lux for 250 occupied hours per year, exists in the space. Another option is to show that illuminance levels are between 300 lux and 3,000 lux between 9:00\u00a0a.m. and 3:00\u00a0p.m. on a clear day at the equinox for 75% or 90% of the floor area in the space. The overall goal of the LEED v4 daylighting metrics is to analyze both the quantity and quality of the light, as well as to balance the use of glazing to ensure more light and less cooling load.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The Lord of Misrule was generally a peasant or sub-deacon appointed to be in charge of Christmas revelries, which often included drunkenness and wild partying.\nThe Catholic Church in England held a similar festival involving a boy bishop. This custom was abolished by Henry VIII in 1541, restored by the Catholic Mary I and again abolished by Protestant Elizabeth I, though here and there it lingered on for some time longer. In continental Europe, it was suppressed by the Council of Basel in 1431, but was revived in some places from time to time, even as late as the eighteenth century. In the Tudor period, the Lord of Misrule (sometimes called the Abbot of Misrule or the King of Misrule) is mentioned a number of times by contemporary documents referring to revels both at court and among the ordinary people.\nWhile mostly known as a British holiday custom, some folklorists, such as James Frazer and Mikhail Bakhtin (who is said to have borrowed the novel idea from Frazer), have claimed that the appointment of a Lord of Misrule comes from a similar custom practised during the Roman celebration of Saturnalia. In ancient Rome, from 17 to 23 December (in the Julian calendar), a man chosen to be a mock king was appointed for the feast of Saturnalia, in the guise of the Roman deity Saturn. This hypothesis has been heavily criticized by William Warde Fowler and as such, the Christmas custom of the Lord of Misrule during the Christian era and the Saturnalian custom of antiquity may have completely separate origins; the two separate customs, however, can be compared and contrasted. Many of the customs regarding the Lord of Misrule have been incorporated into modern-day Carnival and Mardi Gras celebrations. \nHistory.\nAncient Rome.\nOn 1 January, 400 CE, the bishop Asterius of Amasea in Pontus (modern Amasya, Turkey) preached a sermon against the Feast of Calends (\"this foolish and harmful delight\") that describes the role of the mock king in Late Antiquity. The New Year's festival included children arriving at each doorstep, exchanging their gifts for reward:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;This festival teaches even the little children, artless and simple, to be greedy, and accustoms them to go from house to house and to offer novel gifts, fruits covered with silver tinsel. For these they receive, in return, gifts double their value, and thus the tender minds of the young begin to be impressed with that which is commercial and sordid.\u2014\u200a\nIt contrasted with the Christian celebration held, not by chance, on the adjoining day:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;We celebrate the birth of Christ, since at this time God manifested himself in the flesh. We celebrate the Feast of Lights (Epiphany), since by the forgiveness of our sins we are led forth from the dark prison of our former life into a life of light and uprightness.\u2014\u200a\nSignificantly, for Asterius the Christian feast was explicitly an entry from darkness into light, and although no conscious solar nature could have been expressed, it is certainly the renewed light at midwinter that was celebrated among Roman pagans, officially from the time of Aurelian, as the \"festival of the birth of the Unconquered Sun\". Meanwhile, throughout the city of Amasea, although entry into the temples and holy places had been forbidden by the decree of Theodosius I (391), the festival of gift-giving when \"all is noise and tumult\" in \"a rejoicing over the new year\" with a kiss and the gift of a coin, went on all around, to the intense disgust and scorn of the bishop:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;This is misnamed a feast, being full of annoyance; since going out-of-doors is burdensome, and staying within doors is not undisturbed. For the common vagrants and the jugglers of the stage, dividing themselves into squads and hordes, hang about every house. The gates of public officials they besiege with especial persistence, actually shouting and clapping their hands until he that is beleaguered within, exhausted, throws out to them whatever money he has and even what is not his own. And these mendicants going from door to door follow one after another, and, until late in the evening, there is no relief from this nuisance. For crowd succeeds crowd, and shout, shout, and loss, loss.\u2014\u200a\nHonest farmers coming into the city were likely to be jeered at, spanked and robbed. Worse,\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"Even our most excellent and guileless prophets, the unmistakable representatives of God, who when unhindered in their work are our faithful ministers, are treated with insolence.\" For the soldiers, they spend all their wages in riot and loose women, see plays perhaps, \"for they learn vulgarity and the practices of actors\".\nTheir military discipline is relaxed and slackened. They make sport of the laws and the government of which they have been appointed guardians. For they ridicule and insult the august government. They mount a chariot as though upon a stage; they appoint pretended lictors and publicly act like buffoons. This is the nobler part of their ribaldry. But their other doings, how can one mention them? Does not the champion, the lion-hearted man, the man who when armed is the admiration of his friends and the terror of his foes, loose his tunic to his ankles, twine a girdle about his breast, use a woman's sandal, put a roll of hair on his head in feminine fashion, and ply the distaff full of wool, and with that right hand which once bore the trophy, draw out the thread, and changing the tone of his voice utter his words in the sharper feminine treble?\nIn The Golden Bough, James Frazer cites a Greek martyrology which claims that during Saturnalia in Durostorum on the Danube (modern Silistra), Roman soldiers would choose a man from among themselves to be a ceremonial \"temporary king\" for thirty days. At the end of that term, this soldier was to cut his own throat on the altar of Saturn. The Christian Saint Dasius was supposedly chosen for this ritual, but refused to participate, and was martyred as a result. Frazer speculated that a similar ritual of human sacrifice could be the origin of the British Lord of Misrule.\nTudor England.\nIn the Tudor period, John Stow in his \"Survey of London\", published in 1603, gives a description of the Lord of Misrule:\n[I]n the feaste of Christmas, there was in the kinges house, wheresoeuer hee was lodged, a Lord of Misrule, or Maister of merry disports, and the like had yee in the house of euery noble man, of honor, or good worshippe, were he spirituall or temporall. Amongst the which the Mayor of London, and eyther of the shiriffes had their seuerall Lordes of Misrule, euer contending without quarrell or offence, who should make the rarest pastimes to delight the Beholders. These Lordes beginning their rule on Alhollon Eue [Halloween], continued the same till the morrow after the Feast of the Purification, commonlie called Candlemas day: In all which space there were fine and subtle disguisinges, Maskes and Mummeries, with playing at Cardes for Counters, Nayles and pointes in euery house, more for pastimes then for gaine.\nThe Lord of Misrule is also mentioned by Philip Stubbes in his \"Anatomie of Abuses\" (1585), where he states that \"the wilde heades of the parishe conventynge together, chuse them a grand Capitaine (of mischeefe) whom they ennobel with the title Lorde of Misrule.\" He then describes how they dress colourfully, tie bells onto their legs, and \"go to the churche (though the minister be at praier or preachyng) dauncying and swingyng their handercheefes.\"\nDecline of the custom in Britain.\nWith the rise of the Puritan party in the 17th century Church of England, the custom of the Lord of Misrule was outlawed as it was deemed \"disruptive\"; even after the Restoration, the custom remained banned and soon became forgotten. In the early 19th century, the Oxford Movement in the Anglican Church ushered in \"the development of richer and more symbolic forms of worship, the building of neo-Gothic churches, and the revival and increasing centrality of the keeping of Christmas itself as a Christian festival\" as well as \"special charities for the poor\" in addition to \"special services and musical events\". Charles Dickens and other writers helped in this revival of the holiday by \"changing consciousness of Christmas and the way in which it was celebrated\" as they emphasized family, religion, gift-giving, and social reconciliation as opposed to the historic revelry common in some places.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

These techniques can include all aspects of film language, including: sound design, mise-en-sc\u00e8ne, dialogue, cinematography, editing, or direction.\nStyle and the director.\nA film director may have a distinctive filmmaking style that differs from other directors, similar to an author's own distinctive writing style. Through the analysis of film techniques, differences between filmmakers' styles become apparent.\nThere are many technical possibilities available to filmmakers. As a result, no single film will be made using every single technique. Historical circumstances, for example, limit the choices for the director. During the silent film era, filmmakers were not able to use synchronized dialogue until sound became possible in the late 1920s. Films before the 1930s were black and white; now directors have the choice of shooting in color tints or black and white.\nDirectors can choose how to use film language. One of the most noticeable ways to affect film style is through mise-en-sc\u00e8ne, or what appears on the screen. Lighting, costumes, props, camera movements, and backgrounds are all part of mise-en-sc\u00e8ne. There are countless ways to create a film based on the same script simply through changing the mise-en-sc\u00e8ne. Adjusting these techniques creates meaning and can highlight aspects of the narrative. Many filmmakers will create the overall film style to reflect the story.\nStyle and audience.\nMany films conform to the Classical Hollywood narrative film style, which is a set of guidelines that many filmmakers tend to follow. The story in this style is told chronologically in a cause and effect relationship. The main principle in this film style is continuity editing, where editing, camera, and sound should be considered \"invisible\" to the viewers. In other words, attention should not be brought to these elements.\nWhile many filmmakers conform to these guidelines, there are other filmmakers that ignore the guidelines and do bring attention to the film techniques. These filmmakers may violate the standard conventions of film in order to create an innovative style or draw attention to particular aspects of film language.\nThe director decides what is and is not on the screen, guiding what the audience looks at and notices. Although the audience may not consciously absorb film style, it still affects the viewer's experience of the film.\nWhen viewers watch a film, they may have certain expectations based on previous experiences of film because some techniques are commonly found in film and have become conventional. For example, after a long shot there may commonly be a cut to a closer view. If a character is walking across the stage, the audience expects the camera to pan or follow the character's movement. Viewers expect to interact with and be a part of the film, rather than simply being shown a group of images. These expectations come from experiences with both the real and film worlds; we follow a character in our real world with our eyes, just as a camera pans to follow a character on the screen. The audience expects films to appear like real life, and be shot according to a certain style. Classical Hollywood narrative film styles and the conventions of other genres help to guide the audience in what to expect. Some film makers use styles that challenge these conventions.\nDifference between genre and film style.\nFilm style and film genre should not be confused; they are different aspects of the medium. Style is the way a movie is filmed, as in the techniques that are used in the production process. Genre is the category a film is placed in regarding the narrative elements. For instance, Western films are about the American frontier, romance films are about love, and so on.\nFilm style categorizes films based on the techniques used in the making of the film, such as cinematography or lighting. Two films may be from the same genre, but may well look different as a result of the film style. For example, \"Independence Day\" and \"Cloverfield\" are both sci-fi, action films about the possible end of the world. However, they are shot differently, with \"Cloverfield\" using a handheld camera for the entire movie. Films in the same genre do not necessarily have the same film style. Therefore, film genre and film style are two separate, distinct terms in film.\nTypes of film styles.\nGroup styles.\nWhile film style can describe the techniques used by specific filmmakers, it can also be used to describe a movement or group of filmmakers from the same area and/or time period.\nAmerican groups/movements:\nBritish groups/movements:\nFrench groups/movements:\nGerman groups/movements:\nItalian groups/movements:\nOther groups/movements:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The Resettlement Administration recruited Pare Lorentz to produce \"The Plow That Broke the Plains\" to support its campaign of showing the public that the search for profits in the West resulted in the displacement of settlers, misuse of the land, and ultimately resulted in the dust storms that affected the Great Plains regions in the 1930s. The film was one of the most widely publicized attempts by the U.S. federal government to communicate to its citizens through motion pictures.\n\"The Plow That Broke the Plains\" was written and directed by Pare Lorentz independently while the music score was written by composer Virgil Thomson. The film was narrated by the American actor and baritone Thomas Hardie Chalmers.\nIn 1999, \"The Plow That Broke the Plains\" was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".\nBackground.\nThe initial inspiration for \"The Plow That Broke the Plains\" came from Pare Lorentz's desire to make a film on the New Deal that would provide Americans with a fresh look at their country. Lorentz became particularly interested in the drought and dust storms of the early thirties which inspired him to write a lengthy piece on the Dust Bowl for Newsweek. In 1935, Rexford Tugwell, the head of the Resettlement Administration, initially recruited Pare Lorentz as a film consultant as part of the Resettlement Administration staff, because the agency administrators were interested in creating a film about the Dust Bowl. While the Resettlement Administration sponsored extensive photographic surveys of rural poverty conditions, head of the U.S. Department of Agriculture Henry Wallace and Tugwell became interested in using motion pictures as a medium which would bridge gaps in communication between the government and the public. The Director of Information for the Resettlement Administration John Franklin Carter asked Lorentz if he thought a motion picture could be used to interpret the general objectives of the Resettlement Administration which included: improvement of impoverished farm families, prevention of waste due to improper land use, structured utilization of land resources, recultivation of worn out and submarginal land, and relocation of families. Following Lorentz agreement to focus on land use and misuse and an estimate that the film could be produced with six-thousand dollars, Tugwell put his support behind the production of a film about the Dust Bowl.\nIn a letter, Tugwell expressed that the film was to function as an internal educational tool for the Resettlement Administration and its employees to visualize and understand better the problems confronting them and to aid the administration in preventing the results of soil erosion related problems in the Great Plains. Additionally, the film was also to align with the goals of the Resettlement Administration and would explain the causes of the Dust Bowl, while also making a strong case for resettling destitute farmers, retiring marginal farmland from production, and restoring the grasslands in the West.\nIn a review of his own film, Lorentz commented in McCall's Magazine that he had two primary objectives: To show the audience an exciting portion of the country and to portray the events that led to \"one of the major catastrophes in American history,\" the Great Drought and the Dust Bowl. With a limited budget, Lorentz could only map out a small portion of the reality experienced in the Great Plains within a 28-minute frame. He, therefore, had to abstract, simplify, and compress the history of the Great Plains, while still attempting to portray the plains environment and history in a work of art that would not only elicit emotional responses from the audience but coerce them into corrective action that would rehabilitate the area and prevent future ecological catastrophes. Therefore, Lorentz envisioned the film as a \"lyric educational exercise, both practical and aesthetic, incorporating the history of the Great Plains from the first cattle drives to the punishing drought then entering its 6th year.\"\nLorentz's depiction differed from other portrayals of the Great Plains region. While photographers tended to emphasize the people of the plains as blameless victims, and mural artists emphasized the glorious past of the pioneer, Lorentz wanted to present the environmental tale of the Plains as one of decline and refused to see the dust storms as a natural disaster, instead depicting these events as human-created tragedies.\n\"The Plow That Broke the Plains\" also had the benefit of promoting New Deal programs and as President Roosevelt indicated to Lorentz himself, softening the public for subsequent New Deal measures related to public works and health. The use of film also helped Roosevelt circumvent largely Republican-controlled media platforms to promote New Deal policies. Because the film was also released during an election year, it was bound to also generate political rancor.\nPlot.\n\"The Plow That Broke the Plains\" begins with a written prologue appearing as words on the screen that gives a physical description of the Great Plains region as well as a brief history of the plains. Following the written prologue, a map shows the outlines of the Great Plains region within the United States and the political boundaries of the states within it. The motion picture scenes are introduced by displaying the vast grasslands of the Great Plains with narrator Thomas Chalmers speaking about the weather and geographical features of the land, reiterating that the plains are a region with \"high winds and sun without rivers, without streams, and with little rain.\" The following scene introduces the first settlers of the region, the cattle farmers. The narrator continues on, explaining that following the cattle came to the railroads bringing even more settlers who established towns and attracted additional pioneers and plowmen. The next sequences show the arrival of settlers through wagons and caravans as well as the first settlers constructing settlements and breaking the soil in order to farm. The narrator reiterates the phrase \"high winds and sun without rivers, without streams, and with little rain\" but ends with a warning, \"settler, plow at your peril.\"\nFollowing this, the next sequence shows the mechanization of agriculture and the production of grains and crops. The narrator comes back in as the scene transitions to farmers plowing dry soil and a woman sweeping dust from a staircase, explaining that the \"rains failed and the sun baked the light soil\" and that \"many left\" the region. Despite the narrator stating that many settlers were disappointed, a new hope for increasing profits came in the form of World War I. The following scenes show newspapers that display the declaration of World War I and the resulting prices of wheat soaring due to demand. The atmosphere of the film changes to an uplifting and patriotic tone as farmers use mechanized agricultural equipment to prepare the fields for planting and harvesting crops. The narrator exclaims, \"wheat will win the war!\" multiple times while scenes of wheat and grain production appear alongside scenes of war. While scenes of settlers using mechanized farm equipment to harvest the crops continue, the narrator explains how millions of acres were converted over to farmland followed by more images of newspaper articles announcing that large acreage was available to purchase to establish more farmlands.\nFollowing the scenes showing extensive plowing and harvesting, the film cuts to images of dried land, animal bones, and abandoned farm equipment. The narrator again states that the rain did not come and the sun-baked millions of acres of plowed land, with footage of arid plains. As a result of this desertification, massive dust storms swept across the plains, causing people to take shelter, with homes buried under the dust. The narrator states that \"once again they headed West,\" referring to the settlers losing hope and migrating in search of better opportunities. Within the final sequence, the narrator exclaims \"Four hundred million acres the Great Plains seemed inexhaustible yet in 50 years we turned a part of it into a Dust Bowl\" and continues to list the factors that led to the Dust Bowl, such as too many cattle and sheep, plowed lands that should have been left untouched, removal of native grasses to hold soil, and farm machines that made it easy for a single person to plow many acres. The narrator continues to explain that the federal government has been working to salvage whatever land is left and restore it through New Deal initiatives including the Soil Conversation Service, Forest Service, and the Civilian Conservation Corps, while the Resettlement Administration worked to resettle the stranded farmers. The viewer is left with one last message from the narrator who warns that conservation is necessary in order to save the rest of the plains and that \"another decade of reckless use, and the grasslands will truly be the great American desert.\"\nProduction.\nEarly production and filming.\nThe early production period, which consisted of Pare Lorentz conducting research and developing a rough shooting script lasted from June to September 1935. To make the film as inexpensive as possible, Lorentz did not use any professional actors and shot all footage on location. Because sound technology was still new, bringing the equipment into the field to capture human voices and sounds would have been nearly impossible. Therefore, \"The Plow That Broke the Plains\" was initially a silent film with a musical score and narration added later. On September 3, Lorentz secured cameramen Ralph Steiner, Paul Strand, and Leo Hurwitz, each with experience in documentary film production and influenced by the work of Soviet filmmakers. Lorentz scouted locations for filming through examining and researching photos taken by the Resettlement Administration and began filming in September 1935 in Montana.\nOver the next 7 weeks, Lorentz and his cameramen traversed eight states from the Montana-Wyoming border to the Texas Panhandle. Because \"The Plow That Broke the Plains\" was Lorentz's first film, he had difficulty communicating his ideas to the cameramen and filming locations became a point of contention between Lorentz and the crew. Additionally, the cameramen became concerned that the final script had not yet been written either. This resulted in Steiner, Strand, and Hurwitz creating their own script that voiced their own political positions that indicted capitalism, human greed, and a \"lousy social system\" for the devastation of the Great Plains and its residents. Following the Dust Storm sequences in Texas, Lorentz fired the crew and headed to California where Resettlement Administration photographer Dorothea Lange helped him capture scenes of migrants searching for work. Additionally Lorentz needed to finish the film with stock footage, but because the Hollywood community wanted to prevent the film from being completed as many considered it New Deal propaganda, they instructed studios and film libraries to refuse Lorentz's requests. Through friends, Lorentz was able to obtain the stock footage and complete the film after learning how to cut and edit the film himself, due to not having any budget to hire an editor.\nBudget.\nThe Resettlement Administration proposed to have \"The Plow That Broke the Plains\" produced and accompanied with music at an estimated expense of $6,000. Despite the budget allotted to film production, there were times that he worked without pay due to Congress debating whether or not the film should be created. Although Lorentz was salaried, he made only $18 a day, which was less than the cameramen working on the project. The film's final budget, however, end up at $19,260, three times the original budget. Because the initial budget ran out before the film's completion, Lorentz was forced to pay for the music, editing, and final printout from his own pocket. Upon completion, Lorentz went into Rexford Tugwell's office to submit his resignation.\nFilm techniques.\nIn order to engage the audience, Lorentz had to condense the history of the Great Plains into a simplified \"ecological drama\" that would elicit a strong emotional response. Lorentz wrote the script following filming, with narration in a free verse that utilized a Walt Whitman-like repetition of words and phrases to create a mood of judgement. The expository commentary for the film consisted of only 700 words so as to not bombard the viewer with information and\u00a0put more emphasis on picture technique and the musical score which Lorentz thought could speak louder than words.\nSoundtrack.\nVirgil Thomson and composition.\nLorentz interviewed twelve composers and only Virgil Thomson agreed to work on the film following an offer of no more than $500 to write a music score. Thomson and Lorentz agreed that the film should be rendered through the folk music of the Plains people and produced 25 minutes of music in less than a week. After viewing the rough cut of the film, Thomson composed a score that was divided into six movements: Prelude, Pastorale (Grass), Cattle, Blues (Speculation), Drought, and Devastation. The soundtrack was a patchwork of dances, hymns, neo-medieval counterpoint, and chorale-like passages with wide-spaced harmonies, with interludes of familiar folk tunes like \"Streets of Laredo\" and \"Git Along, Little Dogies\". During the war sequence, Thomson accompanied the scene of the phalanx of tractors coming over a hill like a battalion of tanks on a battlefield with American troops marching to the song, \"Mademoiselle from Armentieres.\" The final scene sequence's music is a tango which accompanies the narrator's call to action directed at the audience.\nRecording.\nThe New York Philharmonic recorded the musical score under the direction of conductor Alexander Smallens, while Metropolitan Opera baritone Thomas Chalmers recorded the narration. Thomson scored his accompaniment for a standard orchestra, plus saxophones, guitar, banjo, and harmonium. Because Lorentz had so little money left in his budget, on the day that the score was recorded he forced the session to stop at midnight because he could not afford to pay the New York Philharmonic members overtime. The musicians decided to complete the recording session for free. Following the completion of the final score, Lorentz re-cut sections of the film to accommodate the music.\nReception.\n\"The Plow That Broke the Plains\" had its first showing at the White House in March 1936. After several private showings, the film was officially released to the public at the Mayflower Hotel on May 10, 1936. Following President Roosevelt's private showing, FDR praised Lorentz for his work and wanted to show it to a joint session of Congress. This would have made \"The Plow That Broke the Plains\" the first film to be screened in Congress, but this did not occur due to the House chambers not being equipped to show a film with sound. Although some film reviewers did not agree that \"The Plow That Broke the Plains\" was a pinnacle of artistic achievement, praise was almost unanimous and Lorentz became one of America's foremost directors.\nFollowing the film's release, members of the Hollywood community claimed that due to the film being created by the government it was, therefore, a propaganda film and not a documentary. For this reason, they refused to show it in theaters. Lorentz traveled the country with the film to convince theater owners to show his film. The Rialto Theater in New York agreed and the public reacted positively. This led to other theater owners showing the film as well. Out of 14,000 commercial cinemas nationally, 3,000 screened the film to an audience of about 10 million in 1937. In addition to independent theaters the film was also shown in school auditoriums and public meeting places as well.\nAccording to Robert L. Snyder's book about Lorentz, the filmmaker's favorite comment about the movie was something he heard an audience member say in the row ahead of him: \"They never should have plowed them plains.\"\nControversies.\nDistribution.\nBecause government regulation forbade commercial theaters from charging admission to see the film, theater owners felt that the government was attempting to use them to distribute propaganda. Additionally, motion picture producers and theater owners felt that government-produced films might compete with their own products and threaten their profits, resulting in Hollywood barring the film from its distribution system. As an excuse to not show the film, commercial theaters argued that at 28-minutes long, the film was too short for a feature but too long for a newsreel.\nCriticism.\nFurther sources of controversy came from the film's interpretation of who was responsible for the ecological disaster of the Great Plains. While newsreels, journalists, and Great Plains politicians blamed the disasters on weather, Lorentz rejected this and instead pointed toward mechanized agriculture and human action as being the main culprits. Contemporary critics questioned Lorentz's understanding of the history of the Great Plains by pointing out how he emphasized agricultural expansion as the origin of the Dust Bowl and not the long droughts. Other critics have also explained that Lorentz had overlooked the diversity and vitality of the Great Plains economy and undervalued the quality of life of the farmers in order to build a case for converting substantial areas of the Great Plains back to grassland. Further critics also insisted that Lorentz had portrayed farmers as victims of modern technology and presented them with an unfair and negative image. Another critique of the film is that it also fails to mention the government's own role in the Dust Bowl disaster. Government settlement programs, land-use policies, and entrance into World War I pushed for an increase in agricultural production in the Great Plains are all state actions that critics have suggested contributed to the ecological problems in the Great Plains. The film only suggests that government intervention helped resolve the disaster, rather than that it also contributed to its cause.\nPolitical controversy.\nPlains dwellers and politicians had a strong negative reaction to the release of \"The Plow That Broke the Plains\". People from the region viewed it as a \"great libel\" against the Great Plains and accused the cameramen and Lorentz of selecting isolated spots to depict the entire region. This sentiment was felt particularly in the Dakotas, where residents and elected officials claimed the movie showed distortions and falsehoods. In the state capital of South Dakota, newspaper publisher J.B Hippie invited people to view the film in his Bijou theatre so that local residents could see how egregious the film was and be outraged at the portrayal of the Great Plains and its people. Because the scenes of the movie focused on the severely damaged counties in Texas and Oklahoma panhandles, Dakotans felt the film did not represent the whole plains region. Because the film did not make a distinction between the Great Plains regions, South Dakotans, in particular, feared that the film would deteriorate the state's image and discourage tourism, investors, and cause residents to flee. As a response to the film, South Dakotans created an illustrated pamphlet titled \"The True Story of The Plow that Broke the Plains\" which the Rural Credit Department distributed. The pamphlet's purpose was to display South Dakota's wealth and prosperity through modern tractors farming the plains, wheat fields, and herds of cattle. In 1939, the state legislature budgeted $10,000 to advertise the pamphlet across the state. Attorney and Republican state chairman Harlan Bushfield complained that \"The Plow That Broke the Plains\" the film \"in one savage blow ruthlessly destroyed all the South Dakotans have built up in a generation.\" Some residents rejected the criticisms directed at the film and claimed the depictions to be true. One particular resident from Pennington County rebutted Bushfield's critique stating that he viewed everything through political eyeglasses and that \"his eyesight is affected so much he can't tell a desert anymore when he sees one\".\nFurther condemnation of the film came from the South Dakota Press Association, which petitioned its congressional delegation to get the film withdrawn from circulation due to the belief that it was misrepresenting and harming the state. Because South Dakotans felt that they were more knowledgeable about their own issues and that outsiders such as those involved in New Deal programs had ulterior motives, they rallied behind congressmen Karl Mundt. In Congress Mundt stated that the film was a \"malicious and slanderous attempt to misrepresent the homeland of millions of thrifty people living west of the Mississippi River.\" Due to efforts from politicians like Mundt, the United States Film Service withdrew \"The Plow That Broke the Plains\" from US circulation on April 18, 1939, under the pretense that it would be revised to show the improved agricultural conditions. However, funds never were appropriated to have the planned revision, and \"The Plow That Broke the Plains\" was not made available to the public again until 1961. In Mundt's 1940 reelection campaign, he listed twenty reasons why he should be re-elected, his first point being that he had driven \"The Plow That Broke the Plains\" out of circulation.\nSignificance.\nLegacy.\nThe Resettlement Administration and its successor, the Farm Security Administration, and other government agencies distributed \"The Plow That Broke the Plains\" as an educational service. In addition to screenings in the U.S., the \"Plow That Broke the Plains\" was screened publicly in Canadian educational venues and film societies. At a conference on Canadian-American relations at Queen's University at Kingston in Ontario, \"The Plow That Broke the Plains\" screened as part of a program of films that highlighted problems of adapting to the North American Environment. Additionally \"The Plow That Broke the Plains\" inspired the Canadian film \"Heritage\" (1939). The Canadian Government Motion Picture Bureau produced this film for Canada's Department of Agriculture. While not a copy of \"The Plow That Broke the Plains\", \"Heritage\" used \"The Plow That Broke the Plains\" as a model for how to produce a film particular to Canada's own problems in the Great Plains and to make a case for federal government programs. A U.S. government catalog of documentary film classics states that \"The Plow That Broke the Plains\" \"has been one of the most widely praised and studied documentaries to be produced in America\" and that its images \"serve sort of visual shorthand which expressed a massive social problem on a more intimate and human scale.\" \"The Plow That Broke the Plains\" also generated discussion on the future of the Great Plains and brought up the question as to what extent the land of the Great Plains regions should be used for agriculture. Under the National Film Preservation Act \"The Plow That Broke the Plains\" was selected for preservation in 1999 as it was deemed to be \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically\" significant.\nPolitical legacy.\nFollowing the success of \"The Plow That Broke the Plains\" and \"The River\" (1938), President Roosevelt became interested in how the government could use documentaries to communicate. Roosevelt attempted to continue the financing of the https:// whose purpose was to \"coordinate motion picture activities for the federal government, establish a national film library; set minimum standards for future government films, examine scripts for prospective films; give advice to other movie-making entities private or public, and to produce a small number of films in conjunction with other federal agencies\". However, in response conservative Democrats and Republicans criticized the service for misusing Works Progress Administration funds and creating New Deal Propaganda. Due to Congress's wariness of funding a propaganda machine, it cut the U.S. Film Service budget and its work ended by June 30, 1940. Following the end of the U.S. Film Service, American film efforts were run solely by Hollywood. \"The Plow That Broke the Plains\" was also significant for prospective Democratic congressmen and senators who used the films content to promote their own platforms during their election campaigns.\nRereleases.\nFollowing its removal from circulation in 1939, \"The Plow That Broke the Plains\" was again available to the public in a 1962 release. In 2007 \"The Plow That Broke the Plains\" was re-released by Naxos. The 2007 DVD rerelease had a re-rendered soundtrack by Post-Classical Ensemble conducted by Angel Gil-Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez in addition to new sound effects and a new narration by Floyd King. The DVD rerelease also included special features such as a short excerpt of a 1979 interview with Virgil Thomson in which he makes remarks on the creation of the original musical score, among other interviews regarding the creation of the original film.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The speaker must then propose the question, which is debatable.\nDeriving from British practice, and due to the requirement to remain seated during a division, in the Australian House of Representatives it continues to be customary for a member raising a point of order while the House is voting to hold a sheet of paper over the top of their head.\nIndia.\nIn the Indian Parliament, both the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha, a point of order can raised in relation to the business before the House by any member of the parliament. The decision of the chair is final and no debate is allowed on the point of order, though the chair may hear members before giving the decision.\nIreland.\nIn the Irish Oireachtas (parliament), a point of order can be used in relation to order in the assembly. However, the ruling of the chair in this assembly cannot be appealed.\nUnited Kingdom.\nUntil 1998 in the British House of Commons, it was required that a member raising a point of order while the House is voting must speak \"seated and covered\", i.e. wearing a hat. Two opera hats were maintained in the House for this purpose, with members of parliament sometimes covering their head with an Order Paper while the hat was retrieved. This practice was abolished in accordance with the findings of the Select Committee on the Modernisation of the House of Commons, who said that the practice \"has almost certainly brought the House into greater ridicule than almost any other, particularly since the advent of television\".\nUnited States.\nIn the United States Senate, the chair's ruling on a point of order may be appealed by any senator. Points of order with regard to the Budget Act or annual budget resolution may be waived by &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;3\u20445 of the Senate's entire membership. Rule XVI, which prohibits normal legislation in appropriations legislation, may be waived by &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;2\u20443 of the Senate.\nThe United States House of Representatives also allows points of order and appeals, although they are very rare following the abolishment of open rules in 2016, as they are routinely waived by the United States House Committee on Rules.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "76018", "revid": "33722924", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=76018", "title": "Who Framed Roger Rabbit", "text": "1988 film directed by Robert Zemeckis\nWho Framed Roger Rabbit is a 1988 American fantasy comedy film directed by Robert Zemeckis from a screenplay written by Jeffrey Price and Peter S. Seaman. Combining live-action and animation, it is based on the 1981 novel \"Who Censored Roger Rabbit?\" by Gary K. Wolf. The film stars Bob Hoskins, Christopher Lloyd, Stubby Kaye, and Joanna Cassidy, with Charles Fleischer providing the voice of Roger Rabbit. Set in an alternative history Hollywood in 1947, where humans and cartoon characters (referred to as \"toons\") co-exist, \"Who Framed Roger Rabbit\" follows Eddie Valiant, a private investigator with a grudge against toons, who must help exonerate Roger, who has been framed for murder.\nWalt Disney Studios purchased the film rights for the story in 1981. Price and Seaman wrote two drafts of the script before Disney brought in executive producer Steven Spielberg and his production company, Amblin Entertainment. Zemeckis was brought on to direct, and Canadian animator Richard Williams was hired to supervise the animation sequences. Production was moved from Los Angeles to Elstree Studios in England to accommodate Williams and his group of animators. While filming, the production budget rapidly expanded, and the shooting schedule ran longer than expected.\n\"Who Framed Roger Rabbit\" was released through Disney's Touchstone Pictures banner in the United States on June 22, 1988. The film received critical acclaim for its visuals, humor, writing, performances, and groundbreaking combination of live-action and animation. It grossed over $351 million worldwide, becoming the second-highest-grossing film of 1988, behind \"Rain Man\". It brought a renewed interest in the golden age of American animation, spearheading modern American animation and the Disney Renaissance. It won three Academy Awards for Best Film Editing, Best Sound Effects Editing and Best Visual Effects and received a Special Achievement Academy Award for Williams' animation direction.\nIn 2016, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".\nPlot.\nIn 1947 Los Angeles, animated cartoon characters, or \"toons\", co-exist with humans, often employing their skills to entertain as film stars. Private detective Eddie Valiant, once a staunch ally of the toons alongside his brother and co-worker Teddy, has become a depressed alcoholic following Teddy's murder by an unknown toon five years earlier. Maroon Cartoon Studios owner R.K. Maroon, upset about the recent poor performance of his toon star Roger Rabbit, hires Eddie to investigate rumors that Roger's glamorous toon wife, Jessica, is having an affair with Marvin Acme, owner of both the Acme Corporation and Toontown, the animated metropolis in which toons reside.\nAfter watching Jessica perform at The Ink and Paint Club, Eddie secretly photographs her and Acme playing patty-cake. He shows the pictures to Roger, who becomes distraught and flees, refusing to believe Jessica was unfaithful. The next morning, Acme is found murdered and evidence at the scene implicates Roger as a suspect. Eddie meets Judge Doom, the sinister human judge of Toontown\u2014having bribed the electorate to gain their votes\u2014and his five weasel minions, the Toon Patrol. Doom confirms he plans to execute Roger using the \"Dip\", a chemical concoction of acetone, benzene, and turpentine which is capable of destroying the otherwise invulnerable toons.\nRoger's toon co-star, Baby Herman, suggests to Eddie that Acme's missing will\u2014which supposedly bequeaths Toontown to the toons\u2014may have been the killer's true motive. Eddie returns to his office and finds Roger waiting. Roger insists he has been framed and Eddie reluctantly agrees to help after finding evidence of Acme's will; he hides Roger in a bar tended by his girlfriend, Dolores. Jessica tells Eddie that Maroon threatened Roger's career unless she posed for the compromising photos. Meanwhile, Dolores's research uncovers that Cloverleaf Industries recently bought the city's Pacific Electric railway system and will purchase Toontown at midnight unless Acme's will is found. Doom and the Toon Patrol find Roger, but he and Eddie escape with help from Benny, a toon taxi cab. Sheltering in a local movie theater, Eddie sees a newsreel of Maroon selling his studio to Cloverleaf.\nWhile Eddie goes to the studio to interrogate Maroon, Jessica abducts Roger. Maroon denies involvement in Acme's murder, admitting he intended to blackmail Acme into selling his company as otherwise Cloverleaf would not buy the studio. Maroon is assassinated and Eddie spots Jessica fleeing the scene. Assuming she is the assailant, he reluctantly follows her into Toontown, choosing to discard the last of his alcohol. After saving Eddie from being shot by Doom, Jessica reveals her actions were to ensure Roger's safety and it was Doom who killed Acme and Maroon. Acme gave his will to Jessica for safety but, when she examined it, the paper was blank.\nDoom and the Toon Patrol capture Jessica and Eddie, bringing them to Acme's factory. Doom reveals he is the sole shareholder of Cloverleaf and plans to erase Toontown with a Dip-spraying machine so he can build a freeway in its place, and decommission the railway system to force people to use it. When Roger unsuccessfully attempts to save Jessica, the couple is tied onto a hook in front of the machine's sprayer. Eddie distracts and kills the weasels before fighting Doom. After being flattened by a steamroller, Doom reveals himself as a disguised toon and Teddy's murderer. Struggling against Doom's toon abilities, Eddie uses one of the Acme extending gag mallets to hit a spigot and empties the machine's Dip supply, spraying and dissolving Doom to death. The machine crashes through the wall into Toontown, where it is destroyed by a passenger train.\nAs police and toons gather at the scene, Eddie realizes that Acme's will was written on the blank paper in temporarily invisible ink, confirming the toons inherit Toontown. Having regained his sense of humor, Eddie happily enters Toontown alongside Dolores, Roger, Jessica, and the toons.\nCast.\nLive-action cast.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nVoice cast.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nUncredited cast members include Kathleen Turner as Jessica Rabbit, Roger Rabbit's wife; Frank Welker as Dumbo and a newscaster, Winchell as a cow practising lines, Nancy Cartwright as Yoyo Dodo and a Toon shoe who gets dissolved in Dip, Bill Farmer as Koko the Clown and Goofy's singing voice, and Dave Spafford as Daffy Duck's \"woo-hoos\".\nProduction.\nDevelopment.\nWalt Disney Productions purchased the film rights to Gary K. Wolf's novel \"Who Censored Roger Rabbit?\" shortly after its publication in 1981. Ron W. Miller, then president of Disney, saw it as a perfect opportunity to produce a blockbuster. Jeffrey Price and Peter S. Seaman were hired to write the script, penning two drafts. In 1982, Robert Zemeckis offered his services as director, but Disney declined as his two previous films (\"I Wanna Hold Your Hand\" and \"Used Cars\") had been box-office bombs. Between 1981 and 1983 Disney developed test footage with Darrell Van Citters as animation director, Paul Reubens voicing Roger Rabbit, Peter Renaday as Eddie Valiant, and Russi Taylor as Jessica Rabbit. The project was revamped in 1985 by Michael Eisner, the then-new CEO of Disney. Amblin Entertainment, which consisted of Steven Spielberg, Frank Marshall and Kathleen Kennedy, were approached to produce \"Who Framed Roger Rabbit\" alongside Disney. The original budget was projected at $50 million, which Disney felt was too expensive.\nThe film was finally green-lit when the budget decreased to $30 million, which at the time would have still made it the most expensive animated film ever produced. Walt Disney Studios chairman Jeffrey Katzenberg argued that the hybrid of live-action and animation would \"save\" Walt Disney Feature Animation. Spielberg's contract included an extensive amount of creative control and a large percentage of the box-office profits. Disney kept all merchandising rights. Spielberg convinced Warner Bros., Fleischer Studios, Harvey Comics, King Features Syndicate, Felix the Cat Productions, Turner Entertainment, and Universal Pictures/Walter Lantz Productions to \"lend\" their characters to appear in the film with (in some cases) stipulations on how those characters were portrayed; for example, Disney's Donald Duck and Warner Bros.' Daffy Duck appear as equally talented dueling pianists, and Mickey Mouse and Bugs Bunny also share a scene. Apart from the agreement, and some of the original voice artists reprising their roles, Warner Bros. and the various other companies were not involved in the production of \"Roger Rabbit\". Executives at Warner Bros. were displeased by animators using the Daffy design by Bob Clampett and demanded they use the design by Chuck Jones; in response Zemeckis had separate artists animate Daffy using Jones' design to satisfy Warner Bros., in order to have Clampett's design in the final film. The producers were unable to acquire the rights to use Popeye, Tom and Jerry, Little Lulu, Casper the Friendly Ghost, or the Terrytoons characters for appearances from their respective owners (King Features, Turner, Western Publishing, Harvey Comics, and Viacom). Other characters like Warner Bros.' Bosko, Fleischer Studios' Fitz the Dog and Bimbo; Ub Iwerks' Flip the Frog, and Hanna-Barbera's Yakky Doodle were also planned to appear in the film.\nTerry Gilliam was offered the chance to direct, but he found the project too technically challenging. (\"Pure laziness on my part,\" he later admitted, \"I completely regret that decision.\") Robert Zemeckis was hired to direct in 1985, based on the success of \"Romancing the Stone\" and \"Back to the Future\". Disney executives were continuing to suggest Darrell Van Citters direct the animation, but Spielberg and Zemeckis decided against it. Richard Williams was eventually hired to direct the animation. Zemeckis wanted the film to exhibit \"Disney's high quality of animation, Warner Bros.' characterization, and Tex Avery humor.\"\nCasting.\nHarrison Ford was Spielberg's original choice to play Eddie Valiant, but his price was too high. Chevy Chase was the second choice, but he was not interested. Eddie Murphy reportedly turned down the role as he misunderstood the concept of toons and humans co-existing; he later regretted this decision. In 2025, Murphy elaborated: \"[It] sounded ridiculous to me, and I passed on it. And afterwards, I was like, 'Oh, that's fucking amazing.'\" Robin Williams, Robert Redford, Jack Nicholson, Sylvester Stallone, Edward James Olmos, Wallace Shawn, Ed Harris, Charles Grodin and Don Lane were also considered for the role. Bill Murray was also considered for the role, but due to his idiosyncratic method of receiving offers for roles, Murray missed out on it. Ultimately, Bob Hoskins was chosen by Spielberg because of his acting skill and because Spielberg believed he had a hopeful demeanor and he looked like he belonged in that era.\nPaul Reubens originally auditioned for the role of Roger Rabbit and even provided his voice in an early 1983 screen test, but lost out. Eddie Deezen, who had worked with Zemeckis previously, also auditioned to play Roger, but did not get the part. The role was eventually given to Charles Fleischer. Before filming, Fleischer was asked to come up with a speech impediment for Roger. He gave Roger a lisp and the stammering catchphrase \"P-p-p-please!\" as a tribute to all the other famous cartoon characters with speech impediments, which was inspired by Huntz Hall's Sach Jones in \"The Bowery Boys\". He had invented the \"cheek flutter\" while performing the voice of B.B. in \"Deadly Friend\". His portrayal of Roger was also inspired by Screwy Squirrel. To facilitate Hoskins' performance, Fleischer dressed in a Roger Rabbit costume and \"stood in\" behind camera for most scenes. Williams explained that Roger was a combination of \"Tex Avery's cashew nut-shaped head, the swatch of red hair... like Droopy's, Goofy's overalls, Porky Pig's bow tie, Mickey Mouse's gloves, Br'er Rabbit's feet, and Bugs Bunny-like cheeks.\" Spielberg suggested that Roger's mouth resemble that of Thumper from \"Bambi\". Williams also cited Wile E. Coyote as an influence for Roger's expressions, and wanted the character to have ladle-shaped ears, though his animators would sometimes draw Roger with pointy ears similar to Bugs, much to Williams' frustration.\nKathleen Turner was brought along by Zemeckis to provide the uncredited voice of Jessica Rabbit, Roger Rabbit's wife. Zemeckis had worked with Turner in \"Romancing the Stone\". Turner accepted the role because she was pregnant at the time, and \"just had to show up and do [Jessica's] voice\". Williams explained that Jessica's design and characterization were inspired by Rita Hayworth, Veronica Lake's peek-a-boo hairstyle, and Lauren Bacall, describing the combination as an \"ultimate male fantasy, drawn by a cartoonist\".\nTim Curry auditioned for the role of Judge Doom, but was rejected because the producers found him too terrifying. Christopher Lee was also considered for the role, but turned it down. John Cleese also expressed interest for the role, but was deemed not scary enough. Peter O'Toole, F. Murray Abraham, Roddy McDowall, Eddie Deezen, and Sting were also considered for the role. Christopher Lloyd was cast because he previously worked with Zemeckis and Spielberg on \"Back to the Future\". He compared his part as Doom to his previous role as the Klingon commander Kruge in \"\", both overly evil characters which he considered \"fun to play\". He avoided blinking his eyes while on camera to portray the character.\nLou Hirsch auditioned to play a human character in the film, but ended up providing the voice of Baby Herman instead, which Hirsch described as \"a combination of Wallace Beery and his [British] friends imitating [him]\". Williams stated that Herman's design was a combination of \"Elmer Fudd and Tweety crashed together\". Fleischer also voiced Benny the Cab, Psycho, and Greasy. Lou Rawls was the original choice for Benny the Cab but was replaced by Fleischer. Jim Cummings was originally going to voice some of the weasels. Russi Taylor and Tony Pope recorded some scenes as Minnie Mouse and Goofy, respectively, but said scenes did not make the final cut, despite the former actor being listed in the end credits. Bill Farmer recorded a couple of lines for Goofy and performed his singing voice for one version of the song \"Smile, Darn Ya, Smile!\".\nMel Blanc reprised his roles as Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, Porky Pig, Tweety, and Sylvester the Cat, alternating with his son Noel Blanc during production. Blanc had intended to voice Yosemite Sam and Foghorn Leghorn, but could not do the voices properly as they had become rough on his vocal chords, thus he was replaced with Joe Alaskey. However, a scene featuring Foghorn was cut from the final version. Blanc also could not do Daffy's \"woo-hoos\" as energetic as he used to, so animator Dave Spafford filled in for him. \nWilliams provided the voice of Droopy, whom he stated years later was his favorite cartoon character. Mary Healey recorded Betty Boop's original lines after Mae Questel had dropped out. However, Healey was replaced by Questel, who was brought back to reprise the role. The Toons' singing voices for \"Smile, Darn Ya, Smile!\" at the end of the film were performed by most of the animators, recorded during a wrap party.\nWriting.\nPrice and Seaman were brought aboard to continue writing the script once Spielberg and Zemeckis were hired. For inspiration, the two writers studied the work of Walt Disney and Warner Bros. Cartoons from the Golden Age of American animation, especially Tex Avery and Bob Clampett cartoons. The Cloverleaf streetcar subplot was inspired by \"Chinatown\". Price and Seaman said that \"the Red Car plot, suburb expansion, urban and political corruption really did happen\". \"In Los Angeles, during the 1940s, car and tire companies teamed up against the Pacific Electric Railway system and bought them out of business. Where the freeway runs in Los Angeles is where the Red Car used to be.\" In Wolf's novel \"Who Censored Roger Rabbit?\", the toons were comic-strip characters rather than movie stars.\nDuring the writing process, Price and Seaman were unsure of whom to include as the villain in the plot. They wrote scripts that had either Jessica Rabbit or Baby Herman as the villain, but ultimately chose the newly created character Judge Doom. Doom was supposed to have an animated vulture sit on his shoulder, but this was deleted due to the technical challenges this posed. Doom would also have a suitcase of 12 small, animated kangaroos that act as a jury (a play on \"kangaroo court\"), by having their joeys pop out of their pouches, each with letters, when put together would spell YOU ARE GUILTY. This was also cut for budget and technical reasons.\nThe Toon Patrol (Stupid, Smart Ass, Greasy, Wheezy, and Psycho) satirizes the Seven Dwarfs (Doc, Grumpy, Happy, Sleepy, Bashful, Sneezy, and Dopey), who appeared in \"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\" (1937). Originally seven weasels were to mimic the dwarfs complement, but eventually two of them, Slimey and Sleazy, were written out of the script. Further references included The Ink and Paint Club resembling the Harlem Cotton Club, while Zemeckis compared Judge Doom's invention of the Dip to eliminate all the toons to Hitler's Final Solution. Doom was originally the hunter who killed Bambi's mother. Benny the Cab was first conceived to be a Volkswagen Beetle before being changed to a taxi cab. The \"dueling pianists\" scene was originally storyboarded by Williams and Chuck Jones, in which Donald Duck would receive praise from the audience, and Daffy Duck would only gain the attention of crickets chirping; the scene was changed to fit the film's atmosphere. While working on that scene, Dave Spafford snuck in a frame of Daffy using a baby tied up in rope as one of the props with which to play the piano, which was later removed at Williams' insistence. The animators originally did an homage to the original \"Betty Boop\" shorts at Zemeckis' request, having Betty's dress slide down to reveal her bosom in a single frame; this was removed for later home video releases. Ideas originally conceived for the story also included a sequence set at Marvin Acme's funeral, whose attendees included Eddie, Foghorn Leghorn, Mickey Mouse, Minnie Mouse, Donald Duck, Goofy, the Three Little Pigs, Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, Porky and Petunia Pig, Elmer Fudd, Yosemite Sam, Sylvester the Cat, Hippety Hopper, Tom and Jerry, Droopy, Tex Avery's Big Bad Wolf, Heckle and Jeckle, Chip 'n' Dale, Felix the Cat, Herman and Katnip, Mighty Mouse, Superman, Dick Tracy, Popeye, Olive Oyl, Bluto, Clarabelle Cow, Horace Horsecollar, the Seven Dwarfs, Andy Panda, Baby Huey, Casper the Friendly Ghost, Humphrey Bogart, and Clark Gable in cameo appearances. This scene was cut for pacing reasons at the storyboard stage. Before finally agreeing on \"Who Framed Roger Rabbit\" as the film's title, working titles included \"Murder in Toontown\", \"Toons\", \"Dead Toons Don't Pay Bills\", \"The Toontown Trial\", \"Trouble in Toontown\", and \"Eddie Goes to Toontown\".\nFilming.\nWilliams admitted he was \"openly disdainful of the Disney bureaucracy\" and refused to work in Los Angeles. Accommodating Williams and his animators, production moved to England where a studio, Walt Disney Animation UK (subsuming Richard Williams Animation), was created for this purpose; located at The Forum, 74\u201380 Camden Street, in Camden Town, London, while the live-action production was based at Elstree Studios. Disney and Spielberg also told Williams that in return for doing the film, they would help distribute his unfinished film \"The Thief and the Cobbler\". Supervising animators included Van Citters, Dale Baer, Michael Peraza, Joe Ranft, Tom Sito, James Baxter, David Bowers, Andreas Deja, Mike Gabriel, Chris Jenkins, Phil Nibbelink, Nik Ranieri, Simon Wells, Bruce W. Smith, Peter Western, Uli Meyer, Dave Spafford, and Mark Kausler; Williams and associate producer Don Hahn spearheaded the animation production, with the former animating almost every frame of Baby Herman, whom Williams said was his favorite character. The animation production was split between Walt Disney Animation UK and a specialized unit in Los Angeles, set up by Walt Disney Feature Animation and supervised by Baer. The production budget continued to escalate, while the shooting schedule ran longer than expected. When the budget reached $40 million, Disney CEO Michael Eisner seriously considered shutting down production, but studio chairman Jeffrey Katzenberg talked him out of it. Despite the budget escalating to over $50 million, Disney moved forward on production because they were enthusiastic to work with Spielberg.\nVistaVision cameras installed with motion-control technology were used for the photography of the live-action scenes, which would be composited with animation. Rubber mannequins of Roger Rabbit, Baby Herman, and the Toon Patrol portrayed the animated characters during rehearsals to teach the actors where to look when acting with \"open air and imaginative cartoon characters\". Many of the live-action props held by cartoon characters were shot on set with the props either held by robotic arms or manipulated with strings, similar to a marionette. For example, a test was shot at ILM where an actor playing the detective would climb down a fire escape and the rabbit is supposed to follow and he knocks down some stacked boxes. Naturally, there would not be a rabbit during the test, so the camera would go down the fire escape and the boxes would fall when a wire was pulled. Bob Hoskins studied his daughter Rosa playing with her imaginary friends to get the feel of acting with cartoon characters, and performed his own stunts for the film. The actor who played the voice of Roger, Charles Fleischer, insisted on wearing a Roger Rabbit costume while on the set, to get into character. Principal photography began on December 12, 1986, and lasted for seven and a half months at Elstree Studios, with an additional month in Los Angeles and at Industrial Light &amp; Magic (ILM) for blue screen effects of Toontown. The Dimco Buildings in London were dressed as the fictional Acme Factory. The entrance of Desilu Studios in Los Angeles served as the fictional Maroon Cartoon Studio lot. The scene in which Roger sees birds instead of stars after a refrigerator falls on him during the shooting of the cartoon \"Somethin's Cookin'\" at the beginning of the film was the last scene ever shot.\nAnimation and post-production.\nPost-production lasted for 14 months. ILM had already used CGI and digital compositing in a few movies, such as the stained glass knight scene in \"Young Sherlock Holmes\", but the computers were still not powerful enough to make a complicated movie like \"Who Framed Roger Rabbit\", so all the animation was done using cels and optical compositing. First, the animators and layout artists were given black-and-white printouts of the live-action scenes (known as \"photostats\"), and they placed their animation paper on top of them. The artists then drew the animated characters in relationship to the live-action footage. Due to Zemeckis' dynamic camera moves, the animators had to confront the challenge of ensuring the characters were not \"slipping all over the place.\" Ensuring this did not happen and that the characters looked real, Zemeckis and Spielberg met for about an hour and a half and came up with an idea: \"If the rabbit sits down in an old chair, dust comes up. He should always be touching something real.\" After the rough animation was complete, it was run through the normal process of traditional animation until the cels were shot on the rostrum camera with no background. Williams came up with the idea of making the cartoon characters \"2.5-dimensional\", and the animated footage was sent to ILM for compositing, where technicians animated three lighting layers (shadows, highlights, and tone mattes) separately, to give the characters a sense of depth and create the illusion of them affected by the set lighting. Finally, the lighting effects were optically composited on to the cartoon characters, who were, in turn, composited into the live-action footage. One of the most difficult effects in the film was Jessica's dress in the nightclub scene because it had to flash sequins, an effect accomplished by filtering light through a plastic bag scratched with steel wool. The scene in which a flattened Judge Doom reinflates himself was made using stop motion animation.\nMusic.\nRegular Zemeckis collaborator Alan Silvestri composed the film score, performed by the London Symphony Orchestra (LSO) under the direction of Silvestri. Zemeckis joked that \"the British [musicians] could not keep up with Silvestri's jazz tempo\". The performances of the music themes written for Jessica Rabbit were entirely improvised by a jazz combo performing with the LSO. The work of American composer Carl Stalling heavily influenced Silvestri's work on \"Who Framed Roger Rabbit\". The film's soundtrack was originally released by Buena Vista Records on June 22, 1988, and reissued on CD on April 16, 2002.\nOn January 23, 2018, Intrada Records released a three-CD set with the complete score, alternates, and a remastered version of the original 1988 album, plus music from three Roger Rabbit short films, composed and conducted by Bruce Broughton and James Horner. Mondo Records and Walt Disney Records reissued the original 1988 album on vinyl on September 17, 2021.\nThe film features performances of \"Hungarian Rhapsody\" (Tony Anselmo and Mel Blanc), \"Why Don't You Do Right?\" (Amy Irving), \"The Merry-Go-Round Broke Down\" (Charles Fleischer), and \"Smile, Darn Ya, Smile!\" (Toon Chorus; the film's animators).\nRelease.\nMichael Eisner, then-CEO, and Roy E. Disney, who was the vice chairman of The Walt Disney Company, felt the film was too risqu\u00e9 with adult themes and sexual references. Eisner and Zemeckis disagreed over various elements of it but since Zemeckis had final cut privilege, he refused to make alterations. Roy E. Disney, head of Walt Disney Feature Animation along with studio chief Jeffrey Katzenberg, felt it was appropriate to release the film under the studio's adult-oriented Touchstone Pictures banner instead of the flagship Walt Disney Pictures banner.\nBox office.\nThe film opened in the United States on June 22, 1988, grossing $11.2 million in 1,045 theaters during its opening weekend; it was in first place at the US box office. It was Disney's biggest opening weekend ever at the time of its release. It went on to gross $154.1 million in the United States and Canada and $197.4 million internationally, coming to a worldwide total of $351.5 million. At the time of release, it was the 20th-highest-grossing film of all time. It was also the second-highest-grossing film of 1988, behind only \"Rain Man\". In the United Kingdom, the film also set a record opening for a Disney film.\nHome media.\nThe film was first released on VHS on October 12, 1989, and on DVD on September 28, 1999.\nOn March 25, 2003, Buena Vista Home Entertainment released it as a part of the \"Vista Series\" line in a two-disc collection with many extra features including a documentary, \"Behind the Ears: The True Story of Roger Rabbit\"; a deleted scene in which a pig's head is \"tooned\" onto Eddie's; the three Roger Rabbit shorts, \"Tummy Trouble\", \"Roller Coaster Rabbit\", and \"Trail Mix-Up\"; as well as a booklet and interactive games. The only short on the 2003 VHS release was \"Tummy Trouble\". The 2003 DVD release presents the film in Full Screen (1.33:1) on Disc 1 and Widescreen (1.85:1) on Disc 2.\nOn March 12, 2013, Disney released the film on Blu-ray and DVD combo pack special edition for the film's 25th anniversary. The film was also digitally restored for the release; frame-by-frame digital restoration was done by Prasad Studios removing dirt, tears, scratches, and other defects. Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment released the film on Ultra HD Blu-ray on December 7, 2021.\nReception.\nCritical response.\n\"Who Framed Roger Rabbit\" received near-universal acclaim from critics, making \"Business Insider\"'s \"best comedy movies of all time, according to critics\" list. Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes gives the film an approval rating of based on 76 reviews, and an average rating of 8.5/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \"\"Who Framed Roger Rabbit\" is an innovative and entertaining film that features a groundbreaking mix of live action and animation, with a touching and original story to boot.\" Aggregator Metacritic has calculated a weighted average score of 83 out of 100 based on 15 reviews, indicating \"universal acclaim\". \"Who Framed Roger Rabbit\" was placed on 43 critics' top ten lists, third to only \"The Thin Blue Line\" and \"Bull Durham\" in 1988. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A\" on an A+ to F scale.\nRoger Ebert of the \"Chicago Sun-Times\" gave the film four stars out of four, calling it \"sheer, enchanted entertainment from the first frame to the last-- a joyous, giddy, goofy celebration of the kind of fun you can have with a movie camera.\" He writes that the opening cartoon is \"a masterpiece; I can't remember the last time I laughed so hard at an animated short. But then when a stunt goes wrong and the cartoon 'baby' stalks off the set and lights a cigar and tells the human director to go to hell, we know we're in a new and special universe.\" Gene Siskel of the \"Chicago Tribune\" praised the film's \"dazzling, jaw-dropping opening four-minute sequence\"; he noted that the sequence alone took nearly nine months to animate. Siskel gave the film three-and-a-half stars out of four. Ebert and his colleague Siskel spent a considerable amount of time in the \"Siskel &amp; Ebert\" episode in which they reviewed the film analyzing its painstaking filmmaking. In evaluating their top ten films of the year, Siskel ranked it number two while Ebert ranked it as number eight. Janet Maslin of \"The New York Times\" commented that this is \"a film whose best moments are so novel, so deliriously funny and so crazily unexpected that they truly must be seen to be believed.\" Desson Thomson of \"The Washington Post\" considered \"Roger Rabbit\" to be \"a definitive collaboration of pure talent. Zemeckis had Walt Disney Pictures' enthusiastic backing, producer Steven Spielberg's pull, Warner Bros.'s blessing, Canadian animator Richard Williams' ink and paint, Mel Blanc's voice; Jeffrey Price and Peter S. Seaman's witty, frenetic screenplay; George Lucas' Industrial Light and Magic, and Bob Hoskins' comical performance as the burliest, shaggiest private eye.\" Gene Shalit on the \"Today Show\" also praised the film, calling it \"one of the most extraordinary movies ever made\". Filmsite.org called it \"a technically-marvelous film\" and a \"landmark\" that resulted from \"unprecedented cooperation\" between Warner Bros. and Disney. On CNN's 2019 miniseries \"The Movies\", Tom Hanks called it the \"most complicated movie ever made.\"\nRichard Corliss, a film critic for \"Time\" magazine, wrote: \"The opening scene upstages the movie that emerges from it\". Corliss was mainly annoyed by the homages to the Golden Age of American animation. Chuck Jones criticized the film in his book \"Chuck Jones Conversations\". Among his complaints, Jones accused Zemeckis of robbing Richard Williams of any creative input and ruining the piano duel that both Williams and he had storyboarded.\nLegacy.\nThe critical and commercial success of the film rekindled an interest in the Golden Age of American animation, and in addition to sparking the Silver Age of American animation and the Disney Renaissance, it has also gained a cult following. In November 1988, a few months after the film's release, Roger Rabbit made a guest appearance in the live-action/animated television special \"Mickey's 60th Birthday\", meant to coincide with the 60th anniversary of Mickey Mouse. In 1991, Walt Disney Imagineering began to develop Mickey's Toontown for Disneyland, based on the Toontown that appeared in the film. The attraction also features a ride called Roger Rabbit's Car Toon Spin. Three theatrical animated shorts were also produced: \"Tummy Trouble\" was shown before \"Honey, I Shrunk the Kids\"; \"Roller Coaster Rabbit\" was shown before \"Dick Tracy\"; and \"Trail Mix-Up\" was shown before \"A Far Off Place\". The film also inspired a short-lived comic book and video game spin-offs, including two PC games, the Japanese version of \"The Bugs Bunny Crazy Castle\" (which features Roger instead of Bugs), a 1989 game released on the Nintendo Entertainment System, and a 1991 game released on the Game Boy.\nIn December 2016, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".\n\"Who Framed Roger Rabbit\" served as inspiration for various live-action/animation films in the following decades including \"Cool World\", \"Space Jam\", \"Tom &amp; Jerry\", \"\" (which also features a cameo appearance by Roger), and \"Once Upon a Studio\".\nControversies.\nWith the film's LaserDisc release, \"Variety\" first reported in March 1994 that observers uncovered several scenes of antics from the animators that supposedly featured brief nudity of Jessica Rabbit. While undetectable when played at the usual rate of 24 film frames per second, the LaserDisc player allowed the viewer to advance frame-by-frame to uncover these visuals. Whether or not they were actually intended to depict the nudity of the character remains unknown. Many retailers said that within minutes of the LaserDisc debut, their entire inventory was sold out. The run was fueled by media reports about the controversy, including stories on CNN and various newspapers.\nAnother frequently debated scene includes one in which Baby Herman extends his middle finger as he passes under a woman's dress and re-emerges with drool on his lip. In the scene where Daffy Duck and Donald Duck are dueling on pianos, some heard Donald call Daffy a \"goddamn stupid nigger\", rather than the scripted and recorded line \"doggone stubborn little\".\nLegal issue.\nGary K. Wolf, author of the novel \"Who Censored Roger Rabbit?\", filed a lawsuit in 2001 against The Walt Disney Company. He claimed he was owed royalties based on the value of \"gross receipts\" and merchandising sales. In 2002, the trial court in the case ruled that these only referred to actual cash receipts Disney collected and denied Wolf's claim. In its January 2004 ruling, the California Court of Appeal disagreed, finding that expert testimony introduced by Wolf regarding the customary use of \"gross receipts\" in the entertainment business could support a broader reading of the term. The ruling vacated the trial court's order in favor of Disney and remanded the case for further proceedings. In a March 2005 hearing, Wolf estimated he was owed $7 million. Disney's attorneys not only disputed the claim but also said Wolf owed Disney $500,000\u2013$1 million because of an accounting error discovered in preparing for the lawsuit. Wolf won the decision in 2005, receiving between $180,000 and $400,000 in damages.\nCancelled sequel.\nSpielberg discussed a sequel in 1989 with J. J. Abrams as writer and Zemeckis as producer. Abrams' outline was eventually abandoned. Nat Mauldin was hired to write a prequel titled \"Roger Rabbit: The Toon Platoon\", set in 1941 to 1943. Similar to the previous film, \"Toon Platoon\" featured many cameo appearances by characters from The Golden Age of American Animation. It began with Roger Rabbit's early years, living on a farm in the midwestern United States. With human Ritchie Davenport, Roger travels west to seek his mother, in the process meeting Jessica Krupnick (his future wife), a struggling Hollywood actress. While Roger and Ritchie are enlisting in the Army, Jessica is kidnapped and forced to make pro-Nazi German broadcasts. Roger and Ritchie must save her by going into Nazi-occupied Europe accompanied by several other Toons in their Army platoon. After their triumph, Roger and Ritchie are given a Hollywood Boulevard parade, and Roger is finally reunited with his mother, and his father, Bugs Bunny.\nMauldin later retitled his script \"Who Discovered Roger Rabbit\". Spielberg left the project when deciding he could not satirize Nazis after directing \"Schindler's List\". Eisner commissioned a rewrite in 1997 with Sherri Stoner and Deanna Oliver. Although they kept Roger's search for his mother, Stoner and Oliver replaced the WWII subplot with Roger's inadvertent rise to stardom on Broadway and Hollywood. Disney was impressed and Alan Menken was hired to write five songs for the film and offered his services as executive producer. One of the songs, \"This Only Happens in the Movies\", was recorded in 2008 on the debut album of Broadway actress Kerry Butler. Eric Goldberg was set to be the new animation director, and began to redesign Roger's new character appearance.\nSpielberg became busy establishing DreamWorks, so James Pentecost was set to be the producer, collaborating with remaining producers Frank Marshall and Kathleen Kennedy. Test footage for \"Who Discovered Roger Rabbit\" was shot sometime in 1998 at the Disney animation unit in Lake Buena Vista, Florida; the results were a mix of CGI, traditional animation, and live-action that did not please Disney. A second test had the toons completely converted to CGI. The tests were animated by Tom Bancroft, Barry Temple, Trey Finney, David Nethery, Sherrie Sinclair, James Harris, Teresa Quezada, Jason Peltz, Lon Smart, Eric Guaglione, Rob Bekhurs, and Guner Behich. The second test was dropped as the film's projected budget would escalate past $100 million. Eisner felt it was best to cancel the film. In March 2003, producer Don Hahn doubted a sequel, arguing that public tastes had changed since the 1990s with the rise of computer animation. \"There was something very special about that time when animation was not as much in the forefront as it is now.\"\nIn December 2007, Marshall stated that he was still \"open\" to the idea, and in April 2009, Zemeckis revealed he was still interested. According to a 2009 MTV News story, Jeffrey Price and Peter S. Seaman were writing a new script for the project, and the animated characters would be in traditional two-dimensional, while the rest would be in motion capture. In 2010, Bob Hoskins had agreed to sign on for a sequel, but expressed scepticism about the use of \"performance capture\" in the film. Zemeckis said that the sequel would remain hand-drawn animated and live-action sequences will be filmed, just like in the original film, but the lighting effects on the cartoon characters and some of the props that the toons handle will be done digitally. Also in 2010, Hahn, who was the film's original associate producer, confirmed the sequel's development in an interview with \"Empire\". He stated, \"Yeah, I couldn't possibly comment. I deny completely, but yeah... if you're a fan, pretty soon you're going to be very, very, very happy.\" Hoskins retired from acting in 2012 after a Parkinson's disease diagnosis a year earlier, and died from pneumonia in 2014. Marshall confirmed that the film would be a prequel, similar to earlier drafts, and that the writing was almost complete. During an interview at the premiere of his film \"Flight\", Zemeckis stated that the sequel was still possible, despite Hoskins' absence, and the script for the sequel was sent to Disney for approval.\nIn February 2013, Gary K. Wolf, writer of the original novel, said Erik Von Wodtke and he were working on a development proposal for an animated Disney buddy comedy starring Mickey Mouse and Roger Rabbit called \"The Stooge\", based on the 1952 film of the same name. The proposed film was to be a prequel, taking place five years before \"Who Framed Roger Rabbit\" and part of the story is about how Roger met Jessica. Wolf has stated the film wending its way through Disney.\nIn November 2016, while promoting his film \"Allied\" in England, Zemeckis stated that the sequel \"moves the story of Roger and Jessica Rabbit into the next few years of period film, moving on from film noir to the world of the 1950s\". He also stated that the sequel would feature a \"digital Bob Hoskins\", as Eddie Valiant would return in \"ghost form\". While the director went on to state that the script was \"terrific\" and the film would still use hand-drawn animation, Zemeckis thinks that the chances of Disney green-lighting the sequel are \"slim\". As he explained more in detail, \"The current corporate Disney culture has no interest in Roger, and they certainly don't like Jessica at all\". In December 2018, while promoting his film \"Welcome to Marwen\" and given the 30th anniversary of \"Who Framed Roger Rabbit\", Zemeckis reiterated in an interview with Yahoo! Movies that though the sequel's script was \"wonderful\", Disney was still unlikely to ever produce it, and he did not see the possibility of producing it as an original film for the streaming service Disney+, as he felt that it does not make any sense as there was no \"Princess\" in it. In November 2024, while promoting his latest film \"Here\", Zemeckis again said that one of the reasons Disney would never produce the script, \"as good as it is\", was that Disney finds Jessica Rabbit \"too hot\", citing that they dressed her in a trench coat in the Disneyland attraction Roger Rabbit's Car Toon Spin. Zemeckis said that the original film was made at the right time.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

In his youth, he mastered piano, guitar, violin, flute, and slide trombone. He kept his trombone activities a secret at first, as his circumspect religious father James Henry Fillmore (1849\u20131936)\u2014a composer of gospel songs, often in collaboration with Jessie Brown Pounds\u2014believed it an uncouth and sinful instrument. Henry's mother secretly bought a used trombone for him and obscured from Henry's father the son's learning to play the instrument. Fillmore, whose uncle, Frederick A. Fillmore (1856\u20131925) was also a tune-composer for gospel songs, was a singer for his church choir as a boy. He began composing at 18, with his first published march \"Hingham\", named after a line of brass instruments.\nFillmore attended the Miami Military Institute in Germantown, Ohio from 1899 to 1901, and then entered the Cincinnati Conservatory of Music in 1901.\nPersonal life.\nAfter graduating from the Cincinnati Conservatory of Music, Fillmore traveled the United States as a circus bandmaster with his wife, an exotic vaudeville dancer named Mabel May Jones. They were married in St. Louis.\nCareer.\nDuring the 1920s, Fillmore was back in Cincinnati conducting the Shriners Temple Band, which he turned into one of the best marching bands in the country. After the death of John Philip Sousa in 1932, he was often called \"The March King\".\nFillmore Music House.\nThe Fillmore Music House was co-founded in 1874 by his father, James Fillmore, and his uncle, Frederick Fillmore, under the \"Fillmore Brothers\" name, which began as a Cincinnati-based hymnal publisher. When Henry Fillmore became president after his father's death in 1937, he transformed the firm to focus on orchestral and band music, along with musical instrument sales. In 1951, he announced the Fillmore Music Shop would become an affiliate of Carl Fischer Music of New York, with the condition that it would still operate under the Fillmore name and that all thirteen employees would continue in their employment at the store's 528 Elm Street location.\nFlorida band work.\nIn 1938, Fillmore, after being advised by a physician that he had just a few months to live, retired to Miami, Florida. He went on, however, to prove the physician wrong, keeping an active schedule rehearsing high school bands in Florida and composing marches. The Henry Fillmore Band Hall, the rehearsal hall for many of the University of Miami's performing groups, acquired its name as a tribute to Fillmore's work in the band genre. The hall houses the Fillmore Museum. His march \"Orange Bowl\" was written for Miami's Band of the Hour. \"Uncle Henry\", as Fillmore was affectionately known to the members of the \"Band of the Hour\", also wrote the University of Miami's current official fight song \u2013 \"Miami U How-De-Doo\". His arrangement of \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" is performed by the Florida State University Marching Chiefs. His march \"Men of Florida\" was composed for the bands at the University of Florida. He was given an Honorary Doctorate of Music by the University of Miami in 1956 in recognition of his career. Fillmore lived out the rest of his days in South Florida.\nMusic.\nFillmore wrote over 250 pieces and arranged orchestrations for hundreds more. He published under a variety of pseudonyms, including Gus Beans, Harold Bennett, Ray Hall, Harry Hartley, Al Hayes, and Henrietta Moore. Only the name Will Huff caused any issues, as another Will Huff composed marches and resided in Fillmore's state. Fillmore used many pseudonyms throughout his career and was worried that flooding the market with music published under \"Henry Fillmore\" would dissuade others from purchasing his music. His pseudonyms are associate with grade, or difficulty level, or genre. In a 1953 interview with Jack H. Mahan, Fillmore explained his pseudonym uses: \"Harold Bennett\" was easy and non-progressive, if you can play one, you can play them all. \"Al Hayes\" was a little more difficult. \"Will Huff\" was a duplicate composer (Fillmore's \"Will Huff\" was usually easy grade). \"Henry Fillmore\" could be the easiest marches or the most difficult. \"Harry Hartley\" are all solos; cornet, trombone, and baritone that are easy grade with no triple-tonguing or cadenzas. Solos under other names are just incidental. \"Henrietta Moore\" is all twilight songs.\nA musical trade journal explained matters similarly in 1928: \u201cThe Harold Bennett Group includes selections for various instruments covering a specific range and not too difficult. The Al Hayes group is written for the same instruments, but with a more difficult arrangement; the Harry Hartley group is mostly teachers\u2019 solos; and the Ray Hall group interesting miscellaneous compositions. Under his own name Mr. Fillmore has written many trombone solos and marches.\u201d\nWhile best known for march music and screamers, he also wrote waltzes, foxtrots, hymns, novelty numbers, and overtures. Fillmore's best-known compositions include:\nFillmore gained fame as the \"Father of the Trombone Smear\", writing a series of 15 novelty tunes featuring trombone smears called \"The Trombone Family\". A number of these have a strong ragtime influence. The tunes have subtitles printed on the parts, some of which contain racial slurs. Many were advertised specifically for the minstrel performers of the era. All of Fillmore's trombone rags are as follows:\nOccasionally, as in \"The Footlifter\" credit, Fillmore wrote with the name Harold Bennett.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The short was released on September 24, 1938, and stars Porky Pig venturing out to find the last do-do bird, which he finds in Wackyland, a land that makes no sense located in Darkest Africa.\nIn 1994, \"Porky in Wackyland\" was voted No. 8 of The 50 Greatest Cartoons of all time by members of the animation field. In 2000, it was deemed \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\" by the United States Library of Congress, which selected the short for preservation in the National Film Registry. The short's copyright was renewed in 1966.\nPlot.\nA newspaper shows Porky Pig traveling to Africa to hunt for the last do-do bird. Upon landing his airplane in Darkest Africa, Porky sees a sign telling him that he is in Wackyland, where anything can happen. He tiptoes along the ground in his airplane and is greeted by a roaring beast, who suddenly becomes effeminate and dances away into the forest.\nA musical interlude introduces several more bizarre creatures that inhabit Wackyland's impossible landscape. These include a one-man band that plays its nose like a flute, a rabbit swinging in midair, a duck caricature of Al Jolson, and a beast with the heads of the Three Stooges. One creature wears a sandwich board advertising information about the do-do. The creature beckons Porky into a dark passage, where he falls down a chute and watches the do-do's big entrance. The do-do introduces itself and then tramples Porky while scat singing. Porky gives chase, but the do-do repeatedly uses surreal tricks to escape and humiliate him.\nSome time later, the do-do encounters a newspaper hawker announcing that Porky's hunt has been a success. Confused by the news, the do-do drops its guard long enough for the hawker (Porky in disguise) to grab it. Porky briefly celebrates catching the last do-do, but is bested again when the bird calls for its other do-do friends.\nVoice cast.\nInformation is taken from the website \"Likely Looney, Mostly Merrie\".\nReception.\nSteve Schneider's 1998 \"That's All Folks! The Art of Warner Bros. Animation\" writes that with this short, \"the lord of cartoon misrule, Clampett established conclusively that in animation, realism is irrelevant\".\nIn the 2001 \"Masters of Animation\", John Grant writes that \"this short, in its cumulative effect, is more wildly inventive than anything even [Tex] Avery had produced for Warners\".\nAnimation historian Steve Schneider writes, \"No mere Looney Tune, \"Porky in Wackyland\" was Warner Bros. Emancipation Proclamation. Building on the creaky liberties inaugurated by director Tex Avery, here Bob Clampett scoffs and shreds the conventions \u2014\u00a0realism, literalism, infantilism, cutesiness, and worse \u2014 that, with the ascendancy of Disney, had come to caramelize cartooning. By reminding us of animations' horizons \u2014\u00a0namely, none at all \u2014\u00a0this anything-goes film illustrates Sigmund Freud's notion that humor arises from breaking taboos. And breaking taboos is something that animation, with its limitless freedom, is uniquely gifted to do\".\nFollow-ups and derivative works.\nMuch of the Wackyland sequence was adapted and reused by Clampett for inclusion in his 1943 short \"Tin Pan Alley Cats\". A color remake of \"Porky in Wackyland\" was supervised by Friz Freleng in 1948. Re-titled as \"Dough for the Do-Do\", the remake was released in 1949. The films were nearly identical, in many cases appearing to match frame-by-frame in certain details, albeit with Porky's appearance updated (by redoing most of the animation of the character), the voices having evolved (with less use of speeding-up) and the backgrounds being changed to a surreal, Daliesque landscape. \"Dough for the Do-Do\" was produced in Technicolor, but was originally released in Cinecolor due to a dispute with the Technicolor corporation. Later reissues were printed by Technicolor.\nThere were at least two Terrytoons plagiarizations of \"Porky in Wackyland\" in the 1940s or 1950s. \"Dingbat Land\" (1949) starred Gandy Goose and Sourpuss. The role of the Do-Do was taken by a minor Terrytoons character, Dingbat.\nTex Avery, for whom Clampett worked as an animator in the mid-1930s, borrowed strongly from this cartoon for his 1948 MGM cartoons \"Half-Pint Pygmy\" (in which the characters, George and Junior, travel to Africa in search of the world's smallest pygmy, only to discover that he has an uncle who's even smaller) and \"The Cat That Hated People\" (where the cat travels to the moon and encounters an array of characters similar to those in Clampett's Wackyland, e.g., a pair of gloves and lips that keep saying \"Mammy, mammy\", just like the Al Jolson duck in \"Porky in Wackyland\"). Clampett would again use the Three Stooges parody when a later creation of his, Beany and Cecil, faced the \"Dreaded Three-Headed Threep\".\nAccording to writer Paul Dini, the Do-Do Bird is the father of Gogo Dodo, a character on the 1990s animated TV series \"Tiny Toon Adventures\", and a second Wackyland is drawn into Acme Acres by Babs and Buster Bunny. A small clip from the film was used in a Slappy Squirrel segment on another Warners animated TV series of the 1990s, \"Animaniacs\". The segment, titled \"Critical Condition\", featured \"Porky in Wackyland\" as part of a fake LaserDisc release. The Do-Do Bird has made occasional guest spots in the DC Comics \"Looney Tunes\" comic book, being colored in grayscale as opposed to the rest of the art being in color. The character makes an appearance in the Wii game \"\" as an unplayable character. He is given a first name, Yoyo Dodo. Yoyo can also be seen at Maroon Cartoon Studios as a brief cameo in the beginning of the 1988 film \"Who Framed Roger Rabbit\". Yoyo also made a cameo in the 2020 \"Looney Tunes Cartoons\" short \"Happy Birthday, Bugs Bunny!\" and plays a large role in the stop motion episode \"Daffy in Wackyland\".\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "76023", "revid": "191875", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=76023", "title": "American march music", "text": "Music genre\nAmerican march music is march music written and/or performed in the United States. Its origins are those of European composers borrowing from the military music of the Ottoman Empire in place there from the 16th century. The American genre developed after the British model during the colonial and Revolutionary periods, then later as military ceremonials and for civilian entertainment events.\nOne of the earliest exponents of march music in America and its preeminent champion was John Philip Sousa, \"The March King\"; who revolutionized and standardized American march music during the 19th and early 20th centuries. Some of his most famous marches\u2014\"Semper Fidelis\", \"The Washington Post\", \"The Liberty Bell March\", and \"The Stars and Stripes Forever\"\u2014are among the best known of historical American music and are especially revered by many Americans for their rousing strains and patriotic themes. His \"Stars and Stripes Forever\" features what is arguably the most famous piccolo obligato in all of music.\nOther notable American composers of march music include Henry Fillmore \u2013 \"The Circus Bee\";\nCharles A. Zimmerman \u2013 \"Anchors Aweigh\"; W. Paris Chambers \u2013 \"Sweeney's Cavalcade\"; Edwin E. Bagley \u2013 \"National Emblem March\"; Meredith Willson \u2013 \"Seventy-six Trombones\"; and George Gershwin \u2013 \"Strike Up the Band\". Composers (from Europe or elsewhere) of march music popular in the US include: Johann Strauss Sr \u2013 \"Radetzky March\"; Kenneth J. Alford \u2013 \"Colonel Bogey March\"; Julius Fucik \u2013 \"Entry of the Gladiators\"; Edward Elgar \u2013 \"Pomp and Circumstance (No. 1)\".\nThe forms of American march music typically are of three categories: the military march form, the regimental march form, and a general group containing recapitulation marches, \"four-step\" marches, and other diverse forms. All marches have at least three common elements, including: different (i.e., contrasting) sections called strains; several different melodies; and a \"trio\" section of strains/\"repeats\" that offers pronounced contrasts in phrasing. Most American marches use (seemingly) simple chord progressions, but\u2014using chromatic harmonies, sevenths extensions, and secondary dominants\u2014composers often complicated their marches with interesting chords and rapid chord changes.\nHistory.\nThe true \"march music era\" succeeded in the United States from the 1850s to the 1920s, and persisted through the 1940s as it slowly became shadowed by the coming of jazz in the U.S. Earlier marches by Handel, Mozart, and Beethoven tended to be parts of symphonies or movements in suites. Despite its age and history and its popular performance in the U.S., European march music generally is not thought of as typically American music.\nMarches and the military band.\nThe origins of European and American march music can be traced to the military music of the Ottoman Empire. The martial purposes of the music was to regulate army movements in the field by signalling orders, and to keep time during marching and maneuvers. The extensive use of percussion, especially cymbals, was also for psychological effect as, early on, their use was unknown in Western Europe and had the capacity to frighten opponents. (Indeed, the subsequent adoption of such percussive instruments in European 'classical' music was by direct import from the Ottomans.) Europeans were first exposed to march music in the early 18th century, and interest continued to build into the 1800s when a vogue for Turkish marching bands swept through Europe. Pieces displaying the Turkish influence can be found in the works of Mozart, Haydn, and Beethoven, with a notable example being \"Turkish March\" by Beethoven (part of Op. 113: Overture and incidental music for \"Die Ruinen von Athen\").\nIt was apparently during the latter gunpowder age that military march music was developed for armies to support troop morale by marching with music playing, whether from the melody of a fife or the beat of a drum, or both. American march music developed during the American Revolution and earlier colonial conflicts, in which a fife and snare drum would play while troops marched to battle. Thus it is said that march music is a military music.\nThe tradition of formed lines of soldiers marching into battle with music playing ended soon after the American Civil War in the mid 19th century; military bands continued to perform marches during ceremonial events, which spawned a new tradition of playing marches as a source of entertainment.\nMarches and the concert band.\nDuring the late 19th and early 20th centuries, many U.S. towns, organizations, theaters, and even companies aspired to have their own band. These so-called community/concert bands performed at scheduled parades and concerts and played at impromptu events such as the popular gazebo concerts. Published marches were plentiful due to prolific American composers like John Philip Sousa, Karl L. King, and Henry Fillmore. Marches became a staple in the repertoire of these concert bands, explaining in part how the popularity of march music spread so rapidly across the country.\nMarches and the circus.\nMarches were also popularized during this period by circus bands. The Ringling Brothers and Barnum &amp; Bailey circuses presented their bands performing live march music. Typically, they played a special variety of marches known descriptively as screamers, two-steps, and cakewalks. These tunes served to energize the crowd and focus attention on the circus acts being performed.\nMarches and the marching band.\nThe march music era in the U.S. saw the development of college and high school marching bands, which typically were organized to perform march music during half-time shows and pep-rallies. Composers often dedicated marches to a favored university band.\nJohn Philip Sousa.\nAmerican composer John Philip Sousa revolutionized American march music. His prolific production of quality marches greatly advanced the genre's popularity. According to researcher Paul Bierley, Sousa's marches were known for their simplicity and understatement with rousing counterpoint and overall energy.\nSousa standardized the military march form in America, see below. His marches are typically marked by a \"subdued\" trio\u2014as in \"The Stars and Stripes Forever\", where most of the performing band becomes subordinated to arguably the most famous piccolo obligato in all of music. Sousa's magnum opus, \"The Stars and Stripes Forever\" was adopted in 1987 as the national march of the United States.\nSousa was prolific as both composer and orchestrator, writing 137 marches and more than 80 significant pieces, including operettas, overtures, suites, dances, and fantasies, and publishing some 322 arrangements of nineteenth-century western European symphonic works. He directed the design and production of his namesake instrument, the sousaphone, for its specialized adaption for use in a marching band. For its ease of carry and its forward-directed sound, the sousaphone is widely employed in marching bands and other musical venues.\nNotable march composers in the United States.\nMost march composers were from the United States or Europe. Publishing new march music was most popular during the late 19th and early 20th centuries; sponsors of the genre began to diminish after that time. Following is a list of march music composers whose marches are still performed in the United States.\nFamous marches.\nFollowing is a list of marches popular world-wide and frequently performed in the United States; in alphabetical order.\nMusicality and the march music form.\nThis section discusses the format and other musical aspects of march music.\nMeter.\nThe majority of marches are written in duple meter, meaning they have two beats per measure (or two beats \"to the bar\"). Only a few marches are written otherwise (usually in 4/4 time), while still using the same two beats per measure tempo (see below).\nSeveral meters are used in marches, as follows:\nTempo.\nThe tempo of marches varies significantly. While most bands perform marches in their own tempo, most marches are quick (faster than a waltz, as fast as or slower than a polka). As alluded to before, most march composers did not designate a specific tempo on their manuscripts. However, that is not to say the march music composer is random with his/her tempo while conducting the march. For example, John Philip Sousa conducted his marches using around 120 beats per minute. Most European march composers, however, conducted their marches in a slower style, using around 100 beats per minute. There are, however, many and notable exceptions: see concert march and screamer.\nMarch music forms.\nMost marches follow a fairly strict structure known as the march music form, the origins of which appear to be derived from the sonata form, as these two forms share similar ideas of contrasting sections.\nThe period of early development of the true march music form denotes the start of the march music era in the US by the 1850s; eventually the form was standardized by John Philip Sousa.\nWhile the form varies among different styles of march music, all marches have these common elements:\nFollowing are descriptions of various march forms that have been popular and are/were frequently used by march music composers.\nMilitary march form.\nThe military march form is largely credited to John Philip Sousa, who came to be known as \"The March King\". He standardized the \"military\" form (as compared to the \"regimental\" form), using it in over half of his marches.\nThe military march form is: I-AA-BB-C(C)-Br-C-Br-C(Grandioso); or, in more generic code: I-AA-BB-CCDCDC.\nThe first section of a military march is called the \"introduction\" (I) or fanfare; it is typically 4, 8, or 16 bars long and played in marcato style, using forte (loud) dynamics and chromatic alterations to catch the attention of the listener. The introduction is usually the shortest section of a march and is almost never omitted. Still, examples of marches written without an intro include \"Bugles and Drums\" and \"The Footlifter\".\nIntroductions to marches vary but some standard practices include: (a) \"tutti\" unison (\"The Washington Post\"), (b) \"tutti\" rhythmic unison with contrary motion (\"The Thunderer\"), (c) \"tutti\" rhythm unison in four-part harmony (\"Semper Fi\"), and (d) four-part independent (\"The Klaxon\"). The introduction is commonly based on the dominant key to create clarity of key as centered in the first strain, (see harmonic progressions below). Generally, the intro is not repeated, but it is in some marches: \"Bravura\", \"The Rifle Regiment\", and \"Washington Grays\". The introduction generally starts in major because marches typically are in major keys, but there are marches with introductions in minor keys, including \"Gladiator\", \"The Picadore\", \"Nobles of the Mystic Shrine\", and \"Rolling Thunder\".\nThe next section is commonly called the \"first strain\", as it is the first prominent melody of the march. The first strain is typically 8 or 16 bars long with 4-measure phrases. The first strain can be in either major or minor mode and can use any variety of dynamics, instrumentation and modulations. Typically this strain utilizes similar motifs (as opposed to contrasting motifs\u2014see trio, below) in its phrasing, and it sounds more rhythmically straightforward than the following section.\nAfter the first playing of the strain, it is repeated once, sometimes with added parts such as counter-melodies. The first strain may be repeated yet again after the second strains, particularly if it (first strain) is in minor. Karl L. King frequently arranged this style, as did Henry Fillmore with his trombone smears. Examples include \"Peacemaker March\", \"New York Hippodrome\", \"Caravan Club March\", \"Trombone King\", \"Lassus Trombone\", \"Royal Decree\", and Price's \"March of Youth\".\nThe \"second strain\" is usually 16 bars long and is the second primary melody of the march. However, in marches like \"Solid Men to the Front\", and Sousa's Untitled March, the second strain is 32 bars in length. Some marches commonly play the first run of the second strain quietly and the second run loudly; these include: \"The Stars and Stripes Forever\", \"His Honor\", \"The Washington Post\", \"Hands Across the Sea\", \"On the Mall\", and others, particularly by Sousa.\nThe second strain may use somewhat different instrumentation or may alter the relative dynamics of the different parts. The melody is normally played with the basses, i.e., the low brass and low woodwinds). This strain typically uses 4-measure phrases, but with greatly varied motifs, which causes the melodies to sound more \"stretched out\". For example, many marches use more whole notes in the second strain than the first\u2014as can be heard in \"The Stars and Stripes Forever\". Like the first, the second strain is usually repeated once, sometimes twice; but some marches, including \"Emblem of Freedom\", \"Cyrus the Great\" and the \"Melody Shop\", omit this repeat.\nIn some marches, a short \"introduction to the trio\" is heard, often a repeat of the opening introduction, or it may be a different melody played by the whole band, a fanfare by the brasses\u2014or a \"percussion soli\" (drum roll-off) as heard in \"Semper Fidelis\" by Sousa. Another example of a trio introduction is found in \"Twin Eagle Strut\" by Zane Van Auken.\nThe third (or technically fourth or fifth) primary melody in a march is called the \"trio\", which usually is the \"main melody\" of the march. It typically is played legato style in a softer dynamic and features woodwinds more than brass. Sousa often used clarinets and euphoniums in lower tenor register in his trios. This trio strain is the most contrasting of the sections, often containing variations of motifs heard in the previous two strains.\nThe trio melody may be repeated once at a softer dynamic, or may not be repeated at all. Typically, it is played quietly for the first or second playthrough, then features piccolos (or flutes, or other woodwinds) playing over the trio melody. In almost all cases the trio now modulates to the subdominant key of the march, meaning one flat is added to the key signature. The key is now flatter and this repeat will, with softer instrumentation, offer a relaxing feel from the previous volume. The contrast makes the trio more memorable as the new key is maintained to the end of the strain. (For marches starting in minor keys, the trio usually modulates to the relative major.)\nNext comes the \"breakstrain\" or \"breakup strain\" (sometimes called the \"dogfight\" or \"interlude\"), making it the fourth melody heard. This strain is loud, intense, and marcato. Its purpose can be found in its title, as it literally breaks a gap between the trio sections, providing contrast to the usually softer trio melodies and generating excitement for the listener. Most breakstrains resemble a conversation between the upper woodwinds and the low brass. The final measures typically contain tension-building chords or chromatic motifs.\nThe breakstrain is usually 16 bars long, as in the case of \"Hands Across the Sea\", but marches vary: \"The Washington Post\" and \"The Interlochen Bowl\" have eight-bar breakstrains, where \"On the Mall\" and \"The Purple Pageant\" have 12-bar, and \"The Thunderer\" has a 15-bar breakstrain. \"The Stars and Stripes Forever\" has a 24-bar breakstrain.\nAfter the breakstrain, the trio is usually repeated again, but sometimes the march goes straight to the final trio, as in \"U.S. Field Artillery March\" (the \"Caisson Song\") by John Philip Sousa; most of Goldman's marches in the military form also did this, with the trio only being played twice and the breakstrain once. The trio after the breakstrain (when it is not the final trio) is usually played in the same style as the first, but sometimes counter-melodies or obbligatos are added to these latter runs of the trio. Now the breakstrain is played again and the march moves to the final trio.\nThe final trio is known as the \"grandioso\", \"trio grandioso\" or \"trio\", which typically, as the grand finale, is played through much more loudly than previous runs of the trio. It sometimes adds yet another counter-melody or obligato (such as the one in \"The Stars and Stripes Forever\") and uses all instrumental sections of the band, bringing everything to a close. The grandioso is the most exciting section of the march; its role is to make the trio melody memorable to the listener.\nThe last measure of the march sometimes contains a \"stinger\", a I chord played in unison on the downbeat after a quarter rest. Most, but not all, marches carry a stinger. \"Semper Fidelis\" is a famous march that does not have an ending stinger when not recapitulated back to the beginning of the march (see below). Most marches end at forte volume (loud); one that does not is Sousa's \"Manhattan Beach\", which ends fading away.\nExamples of military marches include \"The Stars and Stripes Forever\" by John Philip Sousa, \"Barnum and Bailey's Favorite\" by Karl L. King, and \"On the Mall\" by Edwin F. Goldman\nRegimental march form.\nThe regimental march form as developed in the US is perhaps older than the military form; it is also called the \"review march\". There are some key differences between the two styles.\nThe regimental march form is: I-AA-BB-CC-DD\nThe introduction, first strain, and second strain are typically that of a military march, but some use a longer (or much longer) introduction.\nAfter the trio the regimental march follows with a strain (D) instead of a breakstrain. This new strain also uses a modulated key and typically relates to the second strain; it is almost always repeated once.\nThe regimental march is considerably shorter than a military march for lack of a third repeat of the trio and breakstrain; thus, it is preferred for performances by marching bands in parades\u2014hence the name \"review march\".\nExamples of regimental marches include Sousa's \"Semper Fidelis\" (when not recapitulated back to the beginning of the march \u2013 see below), \"Men of Ohio\" by Henry Fillmore, \"Bugles and Drums\" by Goldman, and \"Robinson's Grand Entry\" by Karl L. King.\nOther forms and styles.\nSome earlier marches presented a simple, \"four-part\", form: I-AA-BB-CC.\nTypically those marches, having neither a breakstrain nor 'D' section, were written for marching bands or youth bands. The piece was ended by simply playing one repeat of the trio, usually in the grandioso style. Examples include \"Our Director\" by F.E. Bigelow and \"Gallant Marines\" by Karl L. King. Henry Fillmore and Karl King often used the four-part style in their marches. Sousa rarely used this style.\nSousa's marches of the early 1890s (including \"High School Cadets\" and \"Manhattan Beach\"), used an introduction unique to his career.\nMany earlier American and European marches, using either the four-part or the regimental form, recapitulate back to the beginning of the march. Typically, after completing the final trio (or 'D' section), the march is re-started; repeats are ignored, and the piece is ended after the second strain. Codas are rare, but sometimes used; examples: \"Riders for the Flag\" by Sousa and \"Children of the Shrine\" by James Swearingen.\nThe tradition of writing recapitulating marches ended near the start of the American march music era. John Philip Sousa abandoned this technique except with his march \"On Parade\"\u2014one of his few circus marches. Victor Herbert was one of the last American composers to write recapitulating marches. Examples include \"Under the Double Eagle\" by Wagner and \"The Serenade\" by Victor Herbert.\nPhrasing.\nThe basic (and vague) definition of a march describes a piece of music based upon a regular, repeated drum or rhythmic pattern\u2014which means a march is most recognizable by its phrasing. Almost all quickstep marches consist of four-measure, or four-bar, phrases typically ending with a whole note (that either creates or resolves melodic tension, see chord progression), followed by a pickup note. Thus it is said that this \"basic\" framework is what makes marches melodically \"pleasing\".\nSome marches have more noticeable phrases than others. Marches by Karl King have very clear-cut phrases with distinctive whole notes and pickups. In contrast, John Philip Sousa used practically seamless phrasing.\nChords and harmonic progression.\nThe harmonic progressions of American march music are well-grounded in the archetypal harmonic techniques of the times in which they were written. In summary, most American marches use seemingly simple chord progressions for the sake of creating a melodically pleasing sound, however composers often complemented their marches with interesting chords and rapid chord changes\u2014using chromatic harmonies, sevenths extensions, and secondary dominants.\nA detailed discussion of chord progressions follows. (Recommended reading in conjunction with these details: Chord progression and Scale degree.)\nHere is code for the chord progressions of the first strain of \"Semper Fidelis\" by John Philip Sousa. Note, each bar pair (e.g., |G7|), represents one of a total of 16 measures.\nThe first strain begins with a very simple V-I progression (see chord progression basics), creating a wave-like sense of tension and relief within the chord. The use of dominant seven chords makes the V chord stronger and is used in many marches. In the middle of the measure, before the trumpet \"fanfare\", the chord alters to C\u266fdim7 instead of remaining on C. This leads to a G7 chord (rather than to a D minor chord), and is an example of a common-tone diminished seventh chord. This chord \"leads into\" the V chord (G), then to a D7 chord. Here a D chord in the key of C would be the ii chord (as all ii chords must be minor). But the D chord here is \"not\" minor. Rather, it is known as a \"secondary dominant\", i.e., a dominant chord borrowed from different key. (A secondary dominant naturally leads into a chord other than the first (or I chord); here it leads into the V (G7)).\nHere is code for chord progressions of the second strain. \nAs with most second strains of march music, \"rapidly changing\" chords are featured: a legacy of Sousa. The IV chord is used here in marches to create an \"uplifting\" and lyrical sound which tends either to resolve back to the I chord\u2014or to proceed into the V chord, as it does here. At the tenth measure, (|F|E7|), which restates the main theme, Sousa uses a \"deceptive\" chord change. Instead of using F to G7 to C (as in measures two and three), the chord goes from the IV (F) \"to\" V7/VI (i.e., E7), \"to\" the VI (Am). The main melodic theme uses the same notes, but revolves around a different harmonic progression. Sousa then uses his trademark chromatic-accented chord A\u266d7, (a half-step below the previous chord) to create a \"wall of tension\" that quickly resolves into the I chord.\nAnother chromatic-accented chord change often used by march music composers is inverting a I chord with a lowered third and raised fifth. For example, an E\u266d major chord (the I in the key of E\u266d) would be followed by a B major chord (which is an E\u266d chord with a lowered third and raised fifth). Unlike secondary or \"borrowed\" dominants, this chord does not have logical harmonic functions other than to add texture and interest.\nDifficulty of performance.\nThe actual difficulty of performance varies considerably among marches. When first being written for grade school bands then being organized throughout the country, most marches were fairly modest in difficulty. Soon however, there were composers writing scores for (their own) bands that required professional to almost virtuosic skill to perform\u2014some composers noting that any given march might be difficult to play \"perfectly\", that is, with all the correct expressions and articulations and with steady tempo.\nA grading system of difficulty of performance as adapted from Norman Smith's \"March Music Notes\" follows.\nInstrumentation.\nA 'correct' general description of the original instrumentation of (American) march bands is unlikely, as these bands were extremely varied through the 19th and early 20th centuries and most march music was written by composers for their own bands. Thus, almost all bands accumulated marches in repertoire that were written for their specific instrumentation.\nOn the other hand, marches were also written for specific instrumentation to be determined \"locally\". That is, composers simply wrote a piano version of a march which was given to the publisher to arrange the different parts for concert or marching band, or orchestra, etc.\nStill, modern repertoire and arrangements are typically scored for:\nAssignments and roles of instrument sections.\nGenerally, the several instrument sections of an American march band serve the various roles of performing a typical march as follows: \nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Both works depict the relative scale of the universe according to an order of magnitude (or logarithmic scale) based on a factor of ten, first expanding out from the Earth until the entire universe is surveyed, then reducing inward until a single atom and its quarks are observed.\nHistory and background.\nThe first film, A Rough Sketch for a Proposed Film Dealing with the Powers of Ten and the Relative Size of Things in the Universe, was a prototype and was completed in 1968; the second film, Powers of Ten: A Film Dealing with the Relative Size of Things in the Universe and the Effect of Adding Another Zero, was completed in 1977.\nThe \"Powers of Ten\" films were adaptations of the book \"Cosmic View\" (1957) by Dutch educator Kees Boeke. Both films, and a book based on the second film, follow the form of the Boeke original, adding color and photography to the black and white drawings employed by Boeke in his seminal work.\nThe 1977 film has a number of changes from the prototype, including being entirely in color, moving the starting location from Miami to Chicago, removing the relativistic (time) dimension, introducing an additional two powers of ten at each extreme, a change in narrator from Judith Bronowski to Philip Morrison, and much-improved graphics.\nSynopsis.\n1968 version.\nThis version of the film has two clocks in the corner showing the comparison between the viewer's time and that of Earth time.

The viewpoint, accompanied by expository voiceover by Philip Morrison, then slowly zooms out to a view across (or 101 meters in scientific notation). The zoom-out continues (at a rate of one power of ten per 10 seconds), to a view of (where they are shown to be in Burnham Park, near Soldier Field, then (where we see the entirety of Chicago), and so on, increasing the perspective and continuing to zoom out to a field of view of 1024 meters, or a field of view 100 million light years across. The camera then zooms back in at a rate of a power of ten per 2 seconds to the picnic, and then slows back down to its original rate into the man's hand, to views of negative powers of ten: 10 centimeters (10\u22121 meters), and so forth, revealing a white blood cell and zooming in on it\u2014until the camera comes to quarks in a proton of a carbon atom at 10\u221216 meters.\nReception and legacy.\nPhysicist Robbert Dijkgraaf noted: \"It is a brilliant short documentary [...].

Political forces within the realm are such that, in order for the king to retain the crown, his coronation must proceed. Fortuitously, an English gentleman on holiday in Ruritania who resembles the monarch is persuaded to act as his political decoy in an effort to save the unstable political situation of the interregnum.\nA sequel, \"Rupert of Hentzau\", was published in 1898 and is included in some editions of \"The Prisoner of Zenda\". The popularity of the novels inspired the Ruritanian romance genre of literature, film, and theatre that features stories set in a fictional country, usually in Central or Eastern Europe, for example Graustark from the novels of George Barr McCutcheon, and the neighbouring countries of Syldavia and Borduria in the Tintin comics.\nSynopsis.\nOn the eve of the coronation of Rudolf V of Ruritania, he encounters his distant relative, English nobleman Rudolf Rassendyll, come to witness the festivities. The two men look very much alike. The future king and his loyal attendants, Colonel Sapt and Fritz von Tarlenheim, wine and dine their new acquaintance at a hunting lodge. However, Rudolf V's younger half-brother Michael, Duke of Strelsau, sees to it he is presented a bottle of drugged wine. His friends cannot rouse him the next morning.\nNot showing up for the coronation would prove disastrous, but Sapt believes that fate has sent Rassendyll to Ruritania. He persuades the Englishman to impersonate the King. They hide the King in the cellar of the lodge and proceed to the capital. The ceremony goes off without a hitch. However, when they go to retrieve the real King Rudolf, they find that he has been abducted.\nRassendyll must continue his deception, but at least Duke Michael cannot unmask him without incriminating himself. While Sapt searches for the King, Rassendyll becomes acquainted with the beautiful Princess Flavia, who is beloved by the people. He learns that everyone expects them to wed. Despite himself, he falls in love with her, and she with him.\nHelp comes from an unexpected source. Antoinette de Mauban, Michael's mistress, does not want to lose him to Flavia. She confirms that the King is being held in the castle at Zenda. Rassendyll, Sapt, von Tarlenheim and ten picked men go \"hunting\" nearby. An attempt is made on Rassendyll's life by three of the Six, Duke Michael's most trusted henchmen. When that fails, Rupert Hentzau, one of the Six, visits Rassendyll to present Michael's offer of a million crowns to leave the country. When Rassendyll turns him down, Rupert flees after trying to kill him with a dagger. Rassendyll is only wounded in the shoulder.\nThey take captive Johann, a servant working at the castle, and bribe him into telling all he knows. At the first sign of an assault, King Rudolf is to be killed, and his corpse dropped secretly into the water. Michael would be no worse off than before, as Rassendyll could hardly accuse him of regicide.\nA few days pass. Rassendyll swims the moat at night to reconnoiter. He kills a sentry in a boat. He hears King Rudolf talking to one of his captors, then returns to his friends. However, they are discovered by three of the Six. Two of the Six are killed, at the cost of three of Sapt's men, but Rupert reaches the safety of the castle.\nLater, they encounter Rupert again, this time accompanying the body of his friend, one of the Six killed earlier. Rupert privately makes another proposal: Have Sapt and von Tarlenheim lead an assault on the castle. With them and Duke Michael all dead (with Rupert's assistance), the two of them would have all the spoils to themselves. Rupert reveals a contributing motive; he is attracted to Antoinette de Mauban. Rassendyll turns him down.\nMore information is extracted from Johann, including the alarming news that King Rudolf is very ill: ill enough for Duke Michael to send for a doctor. Rassendyll offers Johann another large bribe to open the front door at two in the morning. Rassendyll enters the castle by stealth before then, then watches as Rupert, caught trying to force himself on Antoinette, stabs the outraged Michael. Then, outnumbered by Michael's men, he dives into the moat. Rassendyll kills one of the Six and takes the key to the cell holding King Rudolf. The King is guarded by Detchard and Bersonin. Rassendyll slays Bersonin, but Detchard hurries to murder the King. The doctor sacrifices himself, grappling with Detchard before being murdered, giving Rassendyll time to catch up to and kill Detchard, with the King's assistance.\nRupert appears at the drawbridge, defying Michael's men, and challenges Michael to fight him for Antoinette. However Antoinette cries out that Duke Michael is dead. Rassendyll has obtained a pistol, but cannot bring himself to shoot Rupert. Antoinette has no such qualms, but she misses, and her target leaps into the moat. Then Rassendyll hears Sapt's voice and realizes that reinforcements have arrived. With King Rudolf no longer needing his protection, Rassendyll pursues Rupert. Rupert allows him to catch up. Before their duel can reach a conclusion, however, von Tarlenheim arrives, and Rupert races away on horseback.\nWhen Princess Flavia learns, by accident, about Rudolf Rassendyll, she faints. King Rudolf is restored to his throne, but the lovers are trapped by duty and honour, and must part.\nAdaptations.\nThe novel has been adapted many times, mainly for film but also stage, musical, operetta, radio, and television. Probably the best-known version is the 1937 Hollywood film. The charismatic but Machiavellian Rupert of Hentzau has been interpreted by Ramon Novarro (1922), Douglas Fairbanks Jr. (1937), and James Mason (1952).\nHomages.\nMany subsequent fictional works can be linked to \"The Prisoner of Zenda\"; indeed, this novel spawned the genre known as Ruritanian romance. What follows is a short list of those homages with a clear debt to Anthony Hope's book.\nLegacy.\nIn a popular but very questionable account, a German circus acrobat named Otto Witte claimed he had been briefly mistaken for the new King of Albania at the time of that country's separation from the Ottoman Empire, and that he was crowned and reigned a few days. However, the date of this claim (1913), and the lack of any evidence to back it up, suggest that Witte made up his story after seeing the first film version of the novel. The novel \"Every Inch a King\" (2005) by Harry Turtledove takes Witte's story and places it in a high fantasy setting.\nAuthor Salman Rushdie cited \"The Prisoner of Zenda\" in the epigraph to \"Haroun and the Sea of Stories\", the novel he wrote while living in hiding in the late 1980s. The novel has been part of the syllabus of higher secondary schools in Pakistan for over three decades.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Life in the Donald Duck universe centers on the city of Duckburg and is a part of the larger Mickey Mouse universe. In addition to the original comic book stories by Carl Barks, the Duckburg cast was featured in Little Golden Books, television series such as \"DuckTales\" (1987\u20131990), \"Darkwing Duck\" (1991\u20131992), and the \"DuckTales\" reboot (2017\u20132021), and video games such as \"DuckTales\" (1989), \"QuackShot\" (1991), ' (2000), and ' (2013).\n\"Donald Duck universe\", sometimes called Duckverse or Scrooge McDuck universe, are unofficial terms used by Disney, but are sometimes used by fans. Disney comics artist/writer Don Rosa has also used the terms Barks Universe and Italian Duck Universe to describe different versions of history. According to Carl Barks, the comic book creator of Scrooge McDuck, Duckburg, and its original cast of characters and themes (who also developed Donald Duck and created Daisy Duck and Huey, Dewey and Louie for the early \"Donald Duck\" cartoons) \u2014 \"Now we're beginning to read about Batman's universe, the Spiderman universe. All of those guys had their own universe, and so the ducks have their own universe.\" Barks adds, \"Whenever I wrote the script and it was drawn by some other artist ... it came out looking so different, it didn't look like it belonged in the duck universe .. .Didn't look as real, or I use the word, 'sincere'. You couldn't tell whether the guy who drew it was really interested in turning out a nice product or not.\"\nThe core Duckverse family dates back to the golden age of American animation, generally introduced in Disney shorts, weekly newspaper comics, or comic books of the period as supporting characters for Donald Duck, who premiered in 1934 in \"The Wise Little Hen\" (but was mentioned as a friend of Mickey's as early as 1931). Donald's nephews, Huey, Dewey, and Louie, debuted in 1937 in a comic strip adaptation of an in-production film, Donald's Nephews. Daisy Duck, Donald's on-again-off-again girlfriend premiered in 1940, in \"Mr. Duck Steps Out\". Grandma Duck also appeared in 1940, as a character in the comic strip. Scrooge McDuck, the family's elderly uncle and \"richest duck in the world\", was created in 1947 by Carl Barks for the comic book story \"Christmas on Bear Mountain\".\nOther media.\nScrooge McDuck appeared in the 1960 Disneyland Records LP, \"Donald Duck and His Friends\", in a plot that involved Donald and the Beagle Boys. With the exception of Scrooge's brief cameo in \"The Mickey Mouse Club\" opening theme, this marked the first appearance of a Barks-created character in a medium other than the comics and story books. Later, in 1963, the Beagle Boys played a role in \"Chipmunk Fun,\" an LP that also mentioned Scrooge.\nMost of the characters have appeared in the 1980s Disney cartoon series \"DuckTales\". Disney's \"Darkwing Duck\" series is nominally set in the separate \"DuckTales\" universe, in a metropolis called St. Canard, although aside from sharing the denizen Launchpad McQuack, and a few crossover episodes involving Gizmoduck, there is no interaction. Much of the \"DuckTales\" and all of the \"Darkwing Duck\" material do not appear in Barks' comics, as the two TV series were created decades after Barks's active years as a comic artist. Later, a few characters would be the main characters in the show \"Quack Pack\".\nHowever, in the magazine \"Disney Adventures\", there was a five-part crossover/storyline titled \"Legend of the Chaos God\" which began with \"TaleSpin\", and continued with \"\", \"Goof Troop\", and \"DuckTales\", then concluded with \"Darkwing Duck\".\nDuckburg was the setting of the 1987 animated series \"DuckTales\". The cartoon's version of Duckburg was based loosely on the comics' version. Duckburg appeared in the 1990s animated series \"Quack Pack\". In Quack Pack, Duckburg was populated almost entirely by human beings, with Donald, Daisy, and Donald's nephews as the only anthropomorphized animals that usually appeared. Moreover, the Money Bin is nowhere to be seen. Duckburg was the setting for one of the three initial levels of the video game \"Quackshot\" and also for the second level of the video game \"\".\nDuckburg was also used for the setting of Mickey's Birthday land (later Mickey's Starland) at Walt Disney World's Magic Kingdom from 1988 to 1996. It even included Grandma Duck's Farm and a statue of Cornelius Coot, though it was more of a rural town than a burgeoning metropolis. The connection to Duckburg was removed as the land was renovated in 1996 to become Mickey's Toontown Fair. However, the Cornelius Coot statue remains.\nIn the 2017 version of \"DuckTales\" many elements of the Duck universe from the comics of Don Rosa and Carl Barks were used, alongside elements of others Disney stories (including the original 1987 \"DuckTales\" TV series, \"Darkwing Duck\", \"TaleSpin\", \"Chip 'n Dale Rescue Rangers\", \"Quack Pack\", \"Goof Troop\" and others). They were brought together into one common global storyline in the manner of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.\nCharacters.\nDonald Duck and his maternal uncle Scrooge McDuck received nearly equal exposure in comics. (The reduced emphasis on Donald in the 1980s version of \"DuckTales\" was largely due to a Disney mandate that forbade its nascent television division from using major characters from the Golden Age of Animation, including Donald and Daisy.) Other primary characters include Donald's three young nephews Huey, Dewey, and Louie, and girlfriend Daisy Duck.\nSeveral secondary characters have also achieved star status in certain publications, such as Grandma Duck, Donald Duck's grandmother; Gladstone Gander, Donald Duck's incredibly lucky cousin; Gyro Gearloose, an inventor who is often patronized by Scrooge; and Ludwig Von Drake, a knowledgeable professor. Scrooge also has several enemies, such as the Beagle Boys, a gang of robbers and escaped prisoners; Magica De Spell, an Italian sorceress; and South African Flintheart Glomgold and English-American John D. Rockerduck, both rival business men of Scrooge.\nSome characters have appeared alongside Donald primarily in animation, such as chipmunks Chip 'n' Dale (\"Chip an' Dale\", \"Toy Tinkers\") and Humphrey the Bear (\"Rugged Bear\", \"Grin and Bear It\"), as well as Mickey Mouse (\"The Dognapper\", \"Magician Mickey\"), Goofy (\"Polar Trappers\", \"Frank Duck Brings 'Em Back Alive\"), and Pluto (\"Donald and Pluto\", \"Window Cleaners\"), who are more often associated with the Mickey Mouse universe.\nFictional locations.\nDuckburg.\nDuckburg is the fictional city, located in the fictional U.S. state of Calisota, that serves as the home of Donald Duck, Scrooge McDuck, Huey, Dewey, and Louie, Daisy Duck and most of their supporting cast. Duckburg was first mentioned in \"Walt Disney's Comics and Stories\" #49 in 1944, and was created by Carl Barks.\nThe city is populated by various anthropomorphized animals, with dogs, different birds (including ducks, geese and chickens) and pigs as the most dominant ones. The mayor of the city is often depicted as a pig, whose name most of the time goes unmentioned and is referred instead by readers as the Pig Mayor. However, in some stories the office of mayor is held by various dog characters.\nThe size and structure of Duckburg varied in the works by Barks: it was adjusted to better fit the story he wanted to tell; it could vary from a small town to a medium-sized city, to a bustling metropolis. Later writers and artists adhere to this tradition recurrently. In one specific story by Barks, \"Monsterville\" (1961), Duckburg was even transformed into a futuristic city by Gyro Gearloose, however it proved that the citizens were not ready for the high level of technology that the new city provided. Thus the city was turned back to its old city structure.\nIn comic writer Don Rosa's stories, Duckburg and the state of Calisota is located on the West Coast of the United States, though Carl Barks himself and other writers often leave the city's location more vaguely defined. However, in Don Rosa's \"The Life and Times of Scrooge McDuck\", the author alludes to where exactly he has situated Duckburg: \"I won't bother to say precisely where I situated Duckburg and Calisota on America's west coast\u2026 but if you get out a good map and compare the coastline, you'll see that I stuck the old gold-prospector's adopted hometown directly across the bay from a very appropriately named actual city.\" Knowing how Don Rosa used gags, it is likely that this city would be Eureka, California (\"Eureka\" meaning 'I found it'!). This fits with the river and a large forest south of Eureka. In the DuckTales episode \"Double O' Duck\", a map is shown which shows Duckburg as being located somewhere in Virginia or North Carolina.\nThere are no references to the governor, legislature, Capitol, etc., of Calisota in any of the many stories about Duckburg. However, Duckburg seems to have its own governor, if it is not a sort of city-state. In more than one story a \"Duckburg embassy\" has been shown, which would place it outside the US at a diplomatic level. In the story \"Treasure of Marco Polo\" (Uncle Scrooge #64, 1966) by Carl Barks, the Duckburg embassy displays a flag of Duckburg, which consists of a white duck over a green field. However, in the Don Rosa story \"His Majesty, McDuck\" (Uncle Scrooge Adventures #14, Gladstone Aug. 1989) Scrooge gains a short-lived independence from the United States for Killmotor Hill, thus placing Duckburg within the United States.\nThe most prominent landmark in Duckburg is Scrooge McDuck's Money Bin, a giant building sitting on Killmotor Hill (formerly known as Killmule Hill) in the center of town. The money bin contains both office space, Scrooge's private living quarters and, most famously, three cubic acres of money, the results of Scrooge's lifetime of business and treasure-seeking adventures. Another major landmark in some stories is a large statue of Duckburg's founder, Cornelius Coot.\nDuckburg is a major center for Space exploration, mainly operated and overseen by Gyro Gearloose, and has had expeditions to the Moon, Mars, Venus, the Asteroids, and more remote parts of the Galaxy. The city also features a sea port and is in proximity of a large forest called the Black Forest and to several mountains, the most notable being \"Old Demon Tooth\", usually depicted as a towering pointed peak leaning slightly to the side. The main river of the city is the Tulebug River, first mentioned in \"The Money Well\" (1958) by Carl Barks, and it is located near Killmotor Hill.\nDuckburg is home to Yarvard University (a play on the universities of Harvard and Yale), an institution more notable for its athletic teams than for its academic achievements. It also has had international students, like the bey of El Dagga from Egypt, who is mentioned in Yarvard's first appearance; \"Donald Duck and the Mummy's Ring\" by Carl Barks from 1943. One of the things the bey learned at the university was that mummies do not eat. Duckburg is also the home of the Billionaires Club of some of which Scrooge McDuck, John D. Rockerduck and, according to some stories, Flintheart Glomgold are influential members. Duckburg also has a Ritz Hotel, first mentioned in Carl Barks' story \"Turkey with All the Schemings\" (Walt Disney's Comics and Stories #148, 1953) at which Scrooge McDuck had a business meeting with Donald Duck; who was disguised as the Duke of Baloni, the World's Second-Richest Duck at that time. In the same story Scrooge later buys the Ritz Hotel and he still owns it in Don Rosa's story \"Attaaaaaack!\" (2000).\nLocated near Duckburg is a farm owned and run by Grandma Duck, a direct descendant of Cornelius Coot and Donald's paternal grandmother. Donald's cousin Gus Goose also lives on Grandma's farm as a farmhand. The farm is often a gathering site for various Duck family holiday celebrations.\nIn other languages, Duckburg (for example \"Duckstad\" in Dutch, \"Entenhausen\" in German, \"Ankeborg\" in Swedish, \"Ra\u021bburg\" in Romanian, \"Andeby\" in Danish, or \"Pat\u00f3polis\" in both European and Brazilian Portuguese) is not only home of \"the Ducks\", but Mickey Mouse and friends live there too. This has occasionally been implied also in English-language publications, as when Super Goof is referred to as \"Duckburg's greatest hero\" in a poster seen in the initial panel of the 1973 story \"Galactic Gourmet\" (\"Super Goof\" #27, Gold Key Comics). The story moreover pits Super Goof against the Beagle Boys, normally portrayed as living and operating in Duckburg.\nHistory.\nIn the comics by Don Rosa, Duckburg was a fort built on Killmule Hill on June 17, 1579, by British explorer Sir Francis Drake in the area he named \"Nova Albion\", in what would later become the state of Calisota. It was originally known as \"Fort Drakeborough\". In the year 1818, during the Spanish colonization of California (1697\u20131821), the fort had been handed over by its departing British occupants to the visiting hunter and fur trader Cornelius Coot, who Americanized the British name of the fort to \"Fort Duckburg\". \"Drake\" means a male duck, while \"borough\" and \"burg\" are synonyms. Cornelius Coot turned the old fort into a trading post for fellow traders and hunters, and their families. Eventually a small town grew around the fort on top of Killmule Hill. In Carl Barks' story \"The Day Duckburg Got Dyed\" (1957), it is revealed that Cornelius Coot at some point in Duckburg's history managed to pipe mountain water into the town. During the American Civil War, a decisive battle was fought on top of an unnamed hill in Duckburg, led by the Duckburgian General Stonewall Duck. It is not known on which side the city fought, but with General Stonewall Duck being based on the real-life Stonewall Jackson, it can be assumed they fought for the Confederacy. However, the real-life state of California, in which the fictional state of Calisota is located according to Don Rosa, was a Unionist state, making Duckburg a more likely member of the Union.\nDuckburg remained a quiet, small town until the arrival of wealthy businessman Scrooge McDuck. He had bought the old fort and the hill from fellow prospector Casey Coot, a descendant of Cornelius Coot, during the Klondike Gold Rush in 1899. Scrooge proceeded to construct his famous Money Bin on the location, which would eventually cause McDuck an incredible variety of problems and dilemmas. The first one was caused by the Junior Woodchucks, who were squatting in the site and using the old fort as their headquarters, even though they did not have legal title to it. The dispute led to a small war in 1902, involving the United States marines and navy, led by then President Theodore Roosevelt. Eventually however, the construction of the Money Bin, and Scrooge's establishment of various businesses in and around Duckburg, caused Duckburg's population to swell, and turned the small town into a bustling city and a global financial centre within a few decades.\nCalisota.\nCalisota is a fictional U.S. state, created by Carl Barks in his story \"The Gilded Man\" (\"Four Color\" #422). Duckburg is among the cities located there, as well as Goosetown, a traditional rival of Duckburg, and Mouseton.\nAlthough it has many fictional elements and a variable climate, Calisota is probably synonymous with Jefferson, being roughly equivalent to Northern California. Duckburg is located north of San Francisco, with a map in Don Rosa's \"The Life and Times of Scrooge McDuck\" showing Calisota corresponding to the part of California north of the 39th parallel.\nThe name is a blend of \"California\" and \"Minnesota\", supposedly to allow all kinds of weather or climate in the stories, although Calisota has very little in common with the latter (a state in the Upper Midwest, far from the ocean) and Northern California's regional weather is variable enough by itself.\nBrutopia.\nBrutopia (a blend of \"brute\" and \"Utopia\") is a fictional country appearing in several Donald Duck stories. It was created by Carl Barks in the story \"A Cold Bargain\" from 1957. Brutopia is a hostile country, aiming for world domination. It hence is clearly a caricature of the Soviet Union. In the Duck universe, Brutopia occasionally attempts to steal Scrooge's money so as to devastate the American economy, and to fund the creation of doomsday weaponry. Its national coat of arms has been shown either as a dagger or the hammer and shackles.\nWhether Brutopia is a stand-in for all of the USSR, or just for part of it, varies with the story. Sometimes parallels to Russia are drawn directly. Don Rosa has suggested that Brutopia might instead represent the eastern part of Siberia.\nThe language of Brutopia often looks somewhat Slavic. On some occasions it is written in Cyrillic script. On the other hand, Brutopians seem to speak perfect, non-accented English; and other stories show English language texts being used by Brutopians.\nIn 1957, Brutopia's military spending budget amounted to one trillion dollars plus all the kitchen sinks of its happy people (a number that on closer inspection turned out to be five). Scrooge McDuck outbid the Brutopian government by paying one trillion dollars and six kitchen sinks for a sample of the recently discovered substance of bombastium.\nMoney Bin.\nThe Money Bin is the building where Scrooge McDuck stores the portions of his money he earned by himself. Carl Barks invented the \"money swim\" in his story \"A Financial Fable\" (1950), followed by the \"Money Bin\" in the story \"Terror of the Beagle Boys\" (1951). In Barks' earlier stories, interchangeably with the name Money Bin, the building's official name was the McDuck Building, which was only used on facade signs. Eventually however, the name was discontinued in the later stories by Barks and subsequent writers and artists.\nWhile the first stories showing the Bin treated it as if it had just been built, later continuity established that Scrooge had built the Money Bin in 1902 after having traveled around the world to make his fortune, mostly through prospecting and the establishment of various businesses. Scrooge's favorite pastime is to dive off a springboard into his money and swim through it. In most comic books stories, Scrooge lives at the Money Bin in his private quarters on the top floor, with the rooms often filled with large amounts of money. Because of Scrooge's frugality he has at times even made his own furniture and architecture out of his money; like using moneybags as chairs or using stacked paper bills as stairs to reach high places. The Money Bin also has a worry room in which Scrooge paces around in circles, which has caused a circular depression in the floor, to worry and ponder about hardships that has befallen him. The worry room was first mentioned in Carl Barks' story \"The Secret of Atlantis\" (\"Uncle Scrooge\" #5, 1954).\nThe traditional location of the Money Bin is on top of Killmotor Hill which in turn lies atop a fault line which would prove catastrophic in the event of an earthquake, and this earthquake occurred in the story \"Land Beneath the Ground!\" (1956) by Carl Barks.\nThe Money Bin is the victim of repeated assaults by Scrooge's enemies who try to steal his money, such as the Beagle Boys, who are after the bulk of Scrooge's money, and Magica DeSpell, who is after Scrooge's \"Number One Dime\", the first dime Scrooge ever earned. To protect against these attempted break-ins, Scrooge has installed the greatest security system in the world, which includes Gizmoduck in the \"DuckTales\" TV-Series, to thwart any thought of even trying to intrude onto the premises.\nBarks defined the volume of money contained inside as \"three cubic acres\", but the exact meaning of a \"cubic acre\" left to the reader to interpret, since an acre is a measure of area, not length. Taken literally, a cubic acre would be a 6-dimensional space of 82,653,950,016,000\u00a0ft6, i.e. feet to the sixth power. Taken as an acre that is raised to a cube with each side an acre, it would be around 9\u00a0091\u00a0379\u00a0ft3. A series of blueprints created for the Scrooge McDuck story \"The Beagle Boys vs. the Money Bin\" by Don Rosa state that the Money Bin is approximately tall, and wide. In the story, said blueprints are accredited to an architect named Frank Lloyd Drake, who is based on the real-life architect Frank Lloyd Wright.\nThe Money Bin also contains various valuable artifacts like the Golden Fleece, the Crown of Genghis Khan, the Crown of the Mayas, the Candy-Striped Ruby and the Goose Egg Nugget. According to Carl Barks' story \"The Fabulous Philosopher's Stone\" (Uncle Scrooge #10, 1955) Scrooge also owned the Philosopher's Stone at one point, but it was later confiscated by the International Money Council as it could devastate the economy because of its capability to turn base metals into gold.\nThe Danish and Norwegian names for \"the Money Bin\" are \"Pengetanken\" and \"Pengebingen\", respectively, and these have become a regular word in these languages for a large amount of money or cash.\nRussell W. Belk mentions the Money Bin in \"Material Values in the Comics: A Content Analysis of Comic Books Featuring Themes of Wealth\", where he remarks that Scrooge's \"childish fascination with money\", where he takes pleasure in diving and swimming in the Money Bin, might account for Scrooge not being portrayed as a villain. Penelope Fritzer in the article \"Scrooge McDuck: Postmodern Robber Baron\" considers it possible for the Money Bin to symbolize the entire Disney empire.\nThe Money Bin in the \"DuckTales\" 2017 reboot is given a total redesign. Here it is depicted as a large tower situated on an island in the waters near Duckburg, connected to the city via a bridge, and visible directly from Scrooge's bedroom window. It is perceived as a costly architectural fancy by Scrooge's board of directors, though Scrooge candidly claimed its deranged staff being let go would cause a larger danger. Aside from storing his money, this incarnation of the Money Bin (somewhat emptier due to Scrooge's costly search for the lost Della Duck) also serves as the corporate headquarters of McDuck Industries and the location of Gyro Gearloose's lab.\nGlomgold's bin.\nFlintheart Glomgold also owns a money bin, located near Limpopo Valley in South Africa. Glomgold's bin substitutes the dollar sign ($) that appears on Scrooge's with a pound sign (\u00a3), as the South African pound was the currency of South Africa until 1961. The preference for the pound sign can also be explained by Glomgold's heritage, which puts him as a citizen of South Africa with British blood, whereas Scrooge embraced America despite his pure Scottish blood.\nMillionaires' club.\nThe Millionaires' club (sometimes called the Billionaires' club) is a prominent gentlemen's club in Duckburg, with its premises located in a stately mansion. The club first appeared in the 1959 story \"The Christmas Cha Cha\", written by Bob Gregory and drawn by Carl Barks. Membership of the club is exclusive, with the minimum requirement being owning at least a million dollars.\nScrooge McDuck, Flintheart Glomgold and John Rockerduck are all members of the club, along with several other millionaires. Although Scrooge is clearly the wealthiest man in Duckburg, he is not the speaker of the club nor holds any special position above the other members. A repeating scene is Scrooge arriving at the club to catch up on the daily newspapers, as he is too stingy to buy copies himself. His favourite refreshment at the club is plain tap water as it is the cheapest the club has to offer. Whenever Scrooge meets his rival Rockerduck at the club, the two end up in an argument.\nThe speaker of the club often holds contests requiring spending excessive amounts of money and displaying a flamboyant millionaire lifestyle. Although Scrooge hates these contents because of the excessive spending, he is always forced to take part, in order to maintain his membership and status in the club.\nRecurring elements.\nNumber One Dime.\nThe Number One Dime (sometimes also called Lucky Dime in some games) is the first coin that Scrooge McDuck ever earned (or, according to some stories, produced). The Number One Dime first appeared in the story \"The Round Money Bin\", created by Carl Barks and first published in \"Uncle Scrooge\" #3 (September, 1953). In this story, the dime is so old that it has become thin as a razor blade and allows Scrooge to cut binding ropes and escape from the Beagle Boys. In later stories, it is insinuated that the dime brings good luck to Scrooge and has helped him become a rich man. In some stories, he instantly starts losing money whenever the dime is no longer in his possession. In fact, in some series, Scrooge is so attached to the dime that he becomes hysterical, to the point of losing his mind, whenever he loses possession of the dime.\nIt is never made clear whether the dime actually brings good luck, or if Scrooge merely believes in it so much that he is distressed and makes bad decisions whenever he no longer has his dime. Since Barks never actually said that it was because of the coin that Scrooge was the richest duck in the world, Don Rosa, after various informational exchanges with Barks, for a faithful production of \"The Life and Times Of Scrooge McDuck\", clarified that the Number One Dime is not actually an amulet, and that this vision was just a myth. The Number One Dime is just a sentimental object that happens to be the first coin Scrooge received for his work. Rosa made clear, also, that Scrooge made his fortune working hard and being honest. This point is heavily reinforced in the \"DuckTales\" TV series where Scrooge tells his nephews about the value of hard earned cash.\nThe dime is a key plot point in practically every story featuring Magica De Spell, a character invented by Carl Barks, as the main villain. Magica believes that by stealing the first coin earned by the richest person in the world and melting it down to a magical amulet, she can gain the power of the ancient King Midas, so that everything she touches becomes gold and she can be rich beyond her wildest dreams. The fact that this will only work if the coin indeed belongs to the richest person in the world at the time, and is the first coin that person earned, is crucial, and is made into a plot point in some stories. However, the dime only has magical value because of these circumstances and not on its own. Magica once successfully stole the Dime while helping the Beagle Boys rob McDuck, stopping when she realized this would mean McDuck would no longer be the world's richest person, rendering the Dime worthless.\nAccording to a comic story by Don Rosa, it is an 1875 Seated Liberty dime, but in a comic story written by Pat and Carol McGreal and drawn by Maximino Tortajada Aguilar, the last two digits have been swapped, making it an 1857 Seated Liberty dime.\nScrooge earned the dime in 1877 in his hometown of Glasgow, when he started working as a shoeshine boy on his tenth birthday. Before that it belonged to Howard Rockerduck (the father of John D. Rockerduck). The customer who paid it to him, a ditch-digger called Burt, seemingly \"cheated\" Scrooge. In reality, Scrooge's father, Fergus McDuck, gave Burt the dime specifically for paying Scrooge for his services. Scrooge McDuck never learned that fact, although Fergus did reveal it to Scrooge's sisters Matilda and Hortense. Burt and Magica De Spell, who learned about this when she traveled in time to the day Scrooge earned the Dime, are the only other ones who know. McDuck kept it as a reminder not to be fooled again in the future. When he emigrated to the US three years later, he carried it with him. Scrooge still has the dime and keeps it on a pillow under glass because of its sentimental value. Donald Duck, Huey, Dewey, and Louie, and Gladstone Gander among many others think it is really a lucky charm, but Scrooge himself rejects any claims beyond sentimentality.\nThe Junior Woodchucks.\nThe Junior Woodchucks are the Scouting organization to which Huey, Dewey, and Louie belong. They have a uniform with a coonskin cap. The Junior Woodchucks were created by Carl Barks in 1951, in the story \"Operation St. Bernhard\" (\"Walt Disney's Comics and Stories\" #125). Later stories introduced a similar organization for girls, Junior Chickadees, to which Daisy Duck's nieces, April, May and June belong. The hallmark of the Junior Woodchucks is their spirited dedication to environmental protection and animal welfare, as well as the preservation of knowledge and the furtherance of science. They are also known for their exalted titles and ranks (Huey, Dewey, and Louie being promoted to become \"Ten-Star Generals\" in the 1952 story of the same name) and the awarding of buckets of badges, along with severe ideals as to decorum. In this way Barks poked gentle but pointed satire at aspects of the Boy Scouts.\nBombastium.\nBombastium is a fictional chemical element. Its atomic number and atomic symbol are unknown. Bombastium is stated to be the rarest element in the world. Even though it is very coveted, its usage potential is not entirely known. One characteristic is that it tastes different every time you try it, and scientists eventually discovered that one atom of bombastium dropped into a barrel of water becomes one barrel of ice cream \u2013 a different flavor of ice cream each time. The element is orange-brown in color and is about the size of a soccer ball. To avoid evaporation, bombastium must be kept frozen.\nThe only piece of bombastium known to exist was found in the Belgian Congo, and it was soon after its discovery acquired by Scrooge McDuck in the 1957 story \"A Cold Bargain\" by Carl Barks, but at that time it was also heavily sought after by the hostile nation of Brutopia. Brutopia's military spending budget that year amounted to one trillion dollars plus all the kitchen sinks of its happy people. Scrooge McDuck therefore had to pay one trillion dollars plus six kitchen sinks to win the auction.\nThe element was also used for the 5-part \"DuckTales\" episode \"Time is Money\", which introduced Bubba the Caveduck. In this cartoon episode, bombastium is the fuel for one of Gyro Gearloose's inventions, a time traveling helicopter named the Millennium Shortcut. The bombastium itself must be kept frozen in order for it to be usable as fuel (a small freezer is equipped on board the Shortcut for this purpose). Otherwise, the Shortcut could not travel through time.\nOne of the treasures that can be obtained in the computer game \"\" is bombastium. Unlike the other treasures, bombastium is worth more than just money, as Gyro Gearloose can use it to build a matter transporter which takes away the risk of flying from place to place while having the possible downside of sending the player to a location they had not intended to go.\nSquiggs.\nSquiggs are fairly small fish that are typically eaten \"oolated\". Squiggs were first mentioned in the Carl Barks ten-pager \"Turkey Trouble\" where, in one panel, a can of \"oolated squiggs\" can be seen as a background detail. Don Rosa later used the fish as a key plot element in the story \"Oolated Luck\".\nConserved oolated squiggs are fairly cheap and wholesome food but taste particularly bad, and smell worse. Donald Duck and Gladstone Gander once took part in a competition organized by a company producing oolated squiggs, where the grand prize was an ocean liner cruise. Donald won the grand prize and Gladstone won a year's supply of oolated squiggs.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The film is about a mild-mannered accountant and a con artist theater producer who schemes to get rich by fraudulently overselling interests in a stage musical designed to fail. To this end, they find a playscript celebrating Adolf Hitler and the Nazis and bring it to the stage. Because of this theme, \"The Producers\" was controversial from the start and received mixed reviews. It became a cult film, and found a more positive critical reception later.\n\"The Producers\" was Brooks's directorial debut. For the film, he won an Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay. In 1996, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\" and placed eleventh on the AFI's 100 Years...100 Laughs list. It was later adapted by Brooks and Thomas Meehan as a stage musical, which itself was adapted into a film.\nPlot.\nMax Bialystock is an aging Broadway producer whose career has veered from great success to the depths of near failure. He now ekes out a hand-to-mouth existence while romancing lascivious, wealthy elderly women in exchange for money for a \"next play\" that may never be produced. Leopold \"Leo\" Bloom, a neurotic young accountant prone to hysterics, arrives at Max's office to audit his accounts and discovers a $2,000 discrepancy in the accounts of Max's last play. Max persuades Leo to hide the fraud, and Leo realizes that, since a flop is expected to lose money, the IRS will not investigate its finances, so a producer could earn more from a flop than from a hit by overselling interests and embezzling the funds. Wishing to put this scheme into action and flee to Rio de Janeiro with the profits, Max convinces Leo to join him, treating him to lunch and a day out and saying that his drab life is little different to prison anyway.\nThe partners find the ideal play for their scheme: \"Springtime for Hitler: A Gay Romp with Adolf and Eva at Berchtesgaden\", a \"love letter to Hitler\" written by deranged ex-Nazi soldier Franz Liebkind. Max and Leo bond with Franz over schnapps and tell him they want to show the world a positive representation of Hitler. Now with the stage rights, Max sells 25,000% of the play to investors, using some of the money to redecorate the office and hire an attractive Swedish receptionist, Ulla.\nTo guarantee the show's failure, they hire Roger De Bris, a flamboyantly gay transvestite director, whose productions seldom make it past initial rehearsals. The part of Hitler goes to a hippie named Lorenzo St. DuBois, also known, in a reference to the counterculture drug, as L. S. D., who wanders into the theater during the casting call wearing a necklace made of a can of Campbell's soup attached to a rope. At the theater on opening night, Max tries to ensure a harshly negative review by attempting to bribe a \"New York Times\" theatre critic.\nThe play opens with a lavish production of the title song, \"Springtime for Hitler\", which celebrates Nazi Germany's conquering Europe (\"Springtime for Hitler and Germany/Winter for Poland and France\"). As expected, the audience is horrified and offended. L. S. D. then comes on stage as Hitler, and his beatnik-like portrayal makes the audience think the show is a satire. To Max and Leo's horror, \"Springtime for Hitler\" is a hit, so their investors will be expecting a larger financial return than can be paid out.\nBack at their office, as Max and Leo are fighting after the latter attempts to turn himself in in exchange for a plea bargain, a gun-wielding Franz confronts them, angered by the audience laughing at the depiction of Hitler. He tries first to shoot them, and then himself, but runs out of bullets. The three then decide to blow up the theater to end the production, but they are caught in the explosion and arrested. At the trial, where they are found \"incredibly guilty\" by the jury, Leo makes an impassioned statement praising Max for being his friend and changing his life.\nMax, Leo, and Franz are sent to the state penitentiary, where they produce a new musical called \"Prisoners of Love\". While Max and Franz supervise rehearsals, Leo oversells shares of the play to their fellow prisoners and the warden.\nCast.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nProduction.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Rquote/styles.css\"/&gt;{ class=\"rquote pullquote floatright\" role=\"presentation\" style=\"display:table; border-collapse:collapse; border-style:none; float:right; margin:0.5em 0.75em; width:33%; \"\nEarly publicity.\nA substantive early \"New York Times\" account of the property's genesis dates to December 1961: \"Edward Padula has acquired a new comedy by Mel Brooks tentatively called 'Springtime for Hitler'. The producer said yesterday that actually 'Hitler is not in the comedy.' 'It's a sort of play-within-a-play. The setting is contemporary England.' Kenneth Williams, rated by Mr. Padula as 'England's new comic discovery' is under consideration for the leading role...Work on the new Brooks comedy will start immediately after the local presentation of 'All American'.\"\nWriting and development.\nThe title \"Springtime for Hitler\" was first coined by Brooks as a joke during the press conference for \"All American\" in 1962. Shortly afterwards, he also decided to relate this title to a character named Leo Bloom, an homage to Leopold Bloom, protagonist of James Joyce's \"Ulysses.\" It was reused by him years later once he had an idea about \"two schnooks on Broadway who set out to produce a flop and swindle the backers\". The inspiration was some people Brooks met during his early show business days: Benjamin Kutcher, a New York producer who financed his plays by sleeping with elderly women, became the basis for Max Bialystock, and the scheme had origins in two theater producers who had a lavish lifestyle while making various unsuccessful plays. In her 1943 novel \"The Fountainhead\", Ayn Rand in fact anticipates Mel Brooks's premise by having a consortium of unscrupulous businessmen sell 200 percent of a planned vacation resort which they intend to be a disaster, to that end hiring the controversial modernist architect Howard Roark, but his buildings are a great success, and the backers are prosecuted. When imagining what play \"would have people packing up and leaving the theatre even before the first act is over\", Brooks decided to combine Adolf Hitler and a musical. Brooks, in a 2001 episode of \"60 Minutes\", stated that, while serving in the army, he was called \"Jew boy\", and he lightheartedly admitted that he made \"The Producers\" to \"get even\" with antisemites, particularly Hitler. In another interview, he further explained his reasoning, stating,\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;More than anything the great Holocaust by the Nazis is probably the great outrage of the 20th century. There is nothing to compare with it. And\u00a0... so what can I do about it? If I get on the soapbox and wax eloquently, it'll be blown away in the wind, but if I do Springtime for Hitler it'll never be forgotten. I think you can bring down totalitarian governments faster by using ridicule than you can with invective.\nBrooks first envisioned his story as a novel, and changed it to a play when publishers told him it had \"too much dialogue. Not enough narrative\". He wrote the script in nine months, with the help of secretary Alfa-Betty Olsen. During the process, he mentioned in an October 1966 interview with \"Playboy\" that he was working on \"Springtime for Hitler,\" \"a play within a play, or a play within a film \u2013 I haven't decided yet\". Then, it evolved into a screenplay to take advantage of various settings, as \"it could go places, it wouldn't have to stay in the office\".\nAs Brooks sought backers for his 30-page film treatment, both major film studios and independent filmmakers rejected \"Springtime for Hitler,\" finding the idea of using Hitler for comedy outrageous and tasteless (with some even stating that they would consider the script if Brooks changed it to \"Springtime for Mussolini\"). This changed as Brooks's agent arranged for him to have a meeting with a friend of his, New York producer Sidney Glazier. Glazier laughed so much at Brooks's performance of the script, he accepted the project by saying, \"We're gonna make it! I don't know how, but we're gonna make this movie!\"\nGlazier budgeted the film at $1 million, and sought financiers. Half the money came from philanthropist Louis Wolfson, who liked the idea of laughing at a dictator, and the remainder, along with the distribution, was arranged by Joseph E. Levine of Embassy Pictures. Levine's only condition was to change the title, as he felt many distributors would not carry a picture named \"Springtime for Hitler.\" Brooks renamed it \"The Producers,\" considering it ironic as \"these guys are anything but producers\". As Brooks \"couldn't think of anybody to direct it\", eventually he decided to take the task for himself, even though he himself had only directed one play before. While Levine was insecure in having an inexperienced director, Brooks convinced him by saying it would be cost-effective, and he knew how to do physical comedy after being a stage manager in \"Your Show of Shows.\"\nCasting.\nBrooks wanted Zero Mostel as Max Bialystock, feeling he was an energetic actor who could convey such an egotistical character. Glazier sent the script to Mostel's lawyer, but the attorney hated it and never showed it to the actor. Eventually, Brooks had to send the script through Mostel's wife Kathryn Harkin. While Mostel did not like the prospect of playing \"a Jewish producer going to bed with old women on the brink of the grave\", his wife liked the script so much, she eventually convinced him to accept the role.\nGene Wilder met Brooks in 1963, as Wilder performed with Brooks's then-girlfriend Anne Bancroft in a stage adaptation of \"Mother Courage.\" Wilder complained that the audience was laughing at his serious performance, and Brooks replied that Wilder was \"a natural comic, you look like Harpo Marx\", and said he would cast him as Leo Bloom once he finished the then-titled \"Springtime for Hitler.\" When production arrived, Peter Sellers accepted an invitation to play Leo Bloom, but he never contacted again, so Brooks remembered Wilder, who was about to make his film debut in \"Bonnie and Clyde.\" Wilder received the script to \"The Producers\" as Brooks visited him backstage during a performance of \"Luv\", and his co-star Ren\u00e9e Taylor was brought for a brief appearance as the actress playing Eva Braun.\nDustin Hoffman was originally cast as Liebkind. According to Brooks, late on the night before shooting began, Hoffman begged Brooks to let him out of his commitment to do the role so he could audition for the starring role in \"The Graduate.\" Brooks was aware of the film, which co-starred his now-wife Bancroft, and, skeptical that Hoffman would get the role, agreed to let him audition. When Hoffman did win the role of Ben Braddock, Brooks called in Kenneth Mars as Liebkind. Mars was originally invited because Brooks envisioned him as Roger De Bris, given he played a gay psychiatrist on Broadway. Instead, Mars was interested in the Liebkind role, which became his film debut. He remained in character while not filming as a strategy of method acting. De Bris was instead portrayed by Christopher Hewett, the first actor who read for the role.\nRecent American Academy of Dramatic Arts graduate Lee Meredith was invited to audition as Ulla on condition of being able to do a Swedish accent. She borrowed a book from the AADA library to learn the accent, and won the role with a screen test of the scene in which Ulla dances. Bancroft suggested her friend Andr\u00e9as Voutsinas for the role of Carmen Ghia, feeling his thick Greek accent would fit. Brooks thought of Dick Shawn to play Lorenzo \"L.S.D.\" Saint DuBois, and Shawn accepted because he liked the part and had no other work at the time. Brooks is heard briefly in the film, his voice dubbed over a dancer singing, \"Don't be stupid, be a smarty / Come and join the Nazi Party\", in the song \"Springtime for Hitler\". His version of the line is also dubbed into each performance of the musical, as well as the 2005 movie version.\nFilming.\nPrincipal photography for \"The Producers\" began on May 22, 1967. Filming had to be done in 40 days on a $941,000 budget, and Brooks managed to fit both requests. The primary location was the Chelsea Studios in New York City, where the musical version (2005) was also shot. The now-demolished Playhouse Theatre hosted the \"Springtime for Hitler\" play, and various actors who heard the film was seeking an actor for Hitler were cast in the musical number. The crew tried to film on location whenever possible, filming at such midtown Manhattan locales as Central Park, the Empire State Building, and Lincoln Center.\nBrooks's lack of knowledge of filmmaking had him committing many mistakes during production, requiring the help of assistant director Michael Hertzberg. Being both inexperienced and insecure, Brooks started to have tantrums and behave angrily. He got impatient with the slow development compared to how quick television production was, temporarily banned Glazier from the set, berated a visiting reporter from \"The New York Times\", and had clashes with cinematographer Joseph Coffey and main actor Zero Mostel. Mostel also had a troublesome behavior caused by a leg injury received in a 1960 bus accident, which made his contract feature a clause dismissing Mostel from any work after 5:30 pm. Given the fact that the leg injury got worse in humid weather, the last scene, filmed at the Revson Fountain in Lincoln Center, had Mostel throwing a fit and giving up on production. Glazier had to leave a dentist's appointment and rush to the set where Mostel and Brooks were arguing, and once the producer managed to calm them down, the resulting scene had to be shot all night long.\nDespite being described as a lavish production number, \"Springtime for Hitler\" was not ready until the first rehearsals. Brooks sat with Olsen and first-time composer John Morris at the piano, and improvised some lyrics. Morris then developed the stage performance with choreographer Alan Johnson, instructed to do the number \"big, wonderful, flashy, but terrible\". As Brooks kept suggesting bizarre costume ideas to enhance the burlesque nature of \"Springtime for Hitler\", such as women with clothes inspired by beer mugs and pretzels, Johnson decided to showcase them all in a parade.\nFew scenes had to be altered from the original script. Leo and Max were to visit the Parachute Jump in Coney Island, but the attraction was closed by the time filming began. Brooks filmed Liebkind making Max and Leo swear the Siegfried Oath, where they promised fealty to \"Siegfried\", accompanied by \"The Ride of the Valkyries\" and wearing horned helmets. But feeling that it \"went overboard\", Brooks cut the scene, which was restored in the stage adaptation.\nThe art direction and costumes emphasized the color yellow, which Brooks considered a funny color. For the posters in Bialystock's office, production designer Charles Rosen found a collector in the Theater District and doctored a few posters to include the character's name. Rosen also incorporated an anecdote of his life, as he had to share a small elevator with a flamboyant Broadway director, to design the lift at Roger De Bris's house. Principal photography ended on July 15, 1967. Post-production extended for months, as Brooks had gotten final cut privilege, but still had complaints with Ralph Rosenblum regarding his editing.\nRelease.\nAccording to Brooks, after the film was completed, Embassy executives refused to release it as being in \"bad taste\". The film's premiere in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, on November 22, 1967, was a disaster and the studio considered shelving it. However, relief came when \"Pink Panther\" star Peter Sellers saw the film privately and placed an advertisement in \"Variety\" in support of the film's wide release. Sellers was familiar with the film because, according to Brooks, Sellers \"had accepted the role of Bloom and then was never heard from again\". The film allegedly was \"banned in Germany\". The film was screened in New York City in March 1968. The film's wide release took place on March 18, 1968.\nThe title of the film for the Swedish release uses the translation of the name of the play within the story, \"Springtime for Hitler\". As a result of its success, most of Mel Brooks's subsequent films in Swedish were given similar titles, despite being otherwise unrelated: \"Springtime for Mother-In-Law\", \n\"Springtime for the Sheriff\", \"Springtime for Frankenstein\", \"Springtime for the Silent Movies\", \"Springtime for the Lunatics\", \"Springtime for World History\", \"Springtime for Space\", and \"Springtime for the Slum\". The practice ended by the time \"\" was released, at Brooks's request.\nReception.\nWhen it was first released, the film received a mixed response and garnered some exceptionally harsh reviews, while others considered it a great success. One of the mixed reviews came from Renata Adler, who, writing for \"The New York Times,\" stated: \"\"The Producers\", which opened yesterday at the Fine Arts Theater, is a violently mixed bag. Some of it is shoddy and gross and cruel; the rest is funny in an entirely unexpected way.\" About the acting, she writes that Mostel is \"overacting grotesquely under the direction of Mel Brooks\" and that, in the role of Max Bialystock, he is \"as gross and unfunny as only an enormous comedian bearing down too hard on some frail, tasteless routines can be\". Co-star Wilder fares better and is called \"wonderful\", thanks to doing \"fine\", despite being \"forced to be as loud and as fast as Mostel\" and \"[g]oing through long, infinitely variegated riffs and arpeggios of neuroticism\", and playing his part \"as though he were Dustin Hoffman being played by Danny Kaye\". She also puts the movie into the bigger context of \"contemporary\" comedy and that it has the same \"episodic, revue quality\" in the way it is \"not building laughter, but stringing it together skit after skit, some vile, some boffo\". Her early conclusion, at the end of the first paragraph, is also a comparison to other comedic movies of the time, it reads: \"[\"The Producers\"] is less delicate than Lenny Bruce, less funny than \"Dr. Strangelove,\" but much funnier than \"The Loved One\" or \"What's New Pussycat?\"\"\nThe more critical and negative reviews partly targeted the directorial style and broad ethnic humor, but also commonly noted the bad taste and insensitivity of devising a broad comedy about two Jews conspiring to cheat theatrical investors by devising a designed-to-fail tasteless Broadway musical about Hitler only 23 years after the end of World War II. Among the harshest critics were Stanley Kauffmann in \"The New Republic,\" who wrote that \"the film bloats into sogginess\" and \"Springtime for Hitler\u00a0... doesn't even rise to the level of tastelessness\", John Simon wrote \"The Producers\" \"is a model of how not to make a comedy\", and Pauline Kael who called it \"amateurishly crude\" in \"The New Yorker:\"\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"The Producers\" isn't basically unconventional; it only seems so because it's so amateurishly crude and because it revels in the kind of show-business Jewish humor that used to be considered too specialized for movies. Screenwriters used to take the Jewish out but now that television comedians exploit themselves as stereotypes, screenwriters are putting the Jewish in.\nOn the other hand, others considered the film to be a great success. \"Time\" magazine's reviewers wrote that the film was \"hilariously funny\" but pointed out that \"the film is burdened with the kind of plot that demands resolution\" but unfortunately \"ends in a whimper of sentimentality\". Although they labelled it \"disjointed and inconsistent\", they also praised it as \"a wildly funny joy ride\", and concluded by saying that \"despite its bad moments, [it] is some of the funniest American cinema comedy in years\". The film industry trade paper \"Variety\" wrote, \"The film is unmatched in the scenes featuring Mostel and Wilder alone together, and several episodes with other actors are truly rare.\" Wanda Hale of the New York \"Daily News\" gave the film a full four-star rating and wrote that \"Mel Brooks is a conjurer. Nobody but a conjurer could blend insanity and subtlety and make it a howling success as he has done with point with pride and say: 'This is my picture, my first feature movie.' And the place for you to see it and almost die laughing is at the Fine Arts Theater. [...] Anyone, from whose head came this fantasy with profound undertones, can be forgiven for occasional looseness in direction. But even so, Mel Brooks has done remarkably well with his first feature length film which is sheer magic.\" Joseph Gelmis of \"Newsday\" called the film \"a high-class low comedy about greed and vanity and the perils of trying to make it on Broadway.\" He also described Mostel and Wilder as \"a thinking man's slapstick team which is equidistant between Laurel and Hardy and W. C. Fields and Franklin Pangborn.\"\nOver the years, the film has gained in stature. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of based on reviews with an average rating of . The website's critical consensus reads, \"A hilarious satire of the business side of Hollywood, \"The Producers\" is one of Mel Brooks's finest, as well as funniest films, featuring standout performances by Gene Wilder and Zero Mostel.\" On Metacritic, the film received a score of 96 based on 6 reviews, indicating \"universal acclaim\". In his review decades later, Roger Ebert claimed, \"this is one of the funniest movies ever made\". Ebert wrote, \"I remember finding myself in an elevator with Brooks and his wife, actress Anne Bancroft, in New York City a few months after \"The Producers\" was released. A woman got onto the elevator, recognized him and said, 'I have to tell you, Mr. Brooks, that your movie is vulgar.' Brooks smiled benevolently. 'Lady,' he said, 'it rose below vulgarity.'\"\nThe film was a sleeper hit at the U.S. box office; But Embassy Pictures deemed its initial theatrical run a flop -- considering the additional costs to market and distribute, it barely broke even at the box-office.\nAccolades.\nIn 1996, the film was deemed \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\" by the United States Library of Congress and selected for preservation in the National Film Registry.\nThe film is recognized by American Film Institute in these lists:\nRe-releases and adaptations.\nIn 2002, \"The Producers\" was re-released in three theaters by Rialto Pictures and earned $111,866 at the box office. As of 2007, the film continues to be distributed to art-film and repertory cinemas by Rialto.\nMel Brooks has adapted the story twice more, as a Broadway musical (\"The Producers,\" 2001) and a film based on the musical (\"The Producers,\" 2005). He did not direct the latter, but served as a producer. \nThis film has spawned several home media releases on VHS, Laserdisc, CED, and VCD from companies such as Magnetic Video, Embassy Home Entertainment, PolyGram Video, Speedy, and Lumiere Video. A 1997 letterbox edition Laserdisc was released by PolyGram Video, which served as the basis for the extremely rare 1998 PolyGram DVD release.\nMetro-Goldwyn-Mayer, which owns video rights to select Embassy Pictures titles that ended up with Nelson Entertainment and Polygram, released \"The Producers\" on Region 1 DVD in 2002 and reissued in 2005 to coincide with the remake released that year. In 2013, MGM licensed the title to Shout! Factory to release a DVD and Blu-ray combo pack with a new HD transfer and newly produced bonus materials. StudioCanal, worldwide rights holder to all of the Embassy Pictures library, has also released several R2 DVD editions using a transfer slightly different from the North American DVD and Blu-Ray releases. In 2018, StudioCanal gave the film its European Blu-Ray debut in the UK, Germany, and Australia. The StudioCanal releases included most extras from the Shout! Factory release as well as a new 4K restoration for a 50th anniversary Blu-ray edition.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Scott Fitzgerald\nThe Great Gatsby () is a 1925 tragedy novel by American writer F. Scott Fitzgerald. Set in the Jazz Age on Long Island, near New York City, the novel depicts first-person narrator Nick Carraway's interactions with Jay Gatsby, a mysterious millionaire obsessed with reuniting with his former lover, Daisy Buchanan.\nThe novel was inspired by a youthful romance Fitzgerald had with socialite Ginevra King and the riotous parties he attended on Long Island's North Shore in 1922. Following a move to the French Riviera, Fitzgerald completed a rough draft of the novel in 1924. He submitted it to editor Maxwell Perkins, who persuaded Fitzgerald to revise the work over the following winter. After making revisions, Fitzgerald was satisfied with the text but remained ambivalent about the book's title and considered several alternatives. Painter Francis Cugat's dust jacket art, named \"Celestial Eyes\", greatly impressed Fitzgerald, and he incorporated its imagery into the novel.\nAfter its publication by Scribner's in April 1925, \"The Great Gatsby\" received generally favorable reviews, though some literary critics believed it did not equal Fitzgerald's previous efforts. Compared to his earlier novels, \"This Side of Paradise\" (1920) and \"The Beautiful and Damned\" (1922), the novel was a commercial disappointment. It sold fewer than 20,000 copies by October, and Fitzgerald's hopes of a monetary windfall from the novel were unrealized. When Fitzgerald died in 1940, he believed himself to be a failure and his work forgotten.\nDuring World War II, the novel experienced an abrupt surge in popularity when the Council on Books in Wartime distributed free copies to American soldiers serving overseas. This new-found popularity launched a critical and scholarly re-examination, and the work soon became a core part of most American high school curricula and a part of American popular culture. Numerous stage and film adaptations followed in the subsequent decades.\n\"Gatsby\" continues to attract popular and scholarly attention. Scholars emphasize the novel's treatment of social class, inherited versus self-made wealth, gender, race, and environmentalism, as well as its cynical attitude towards the American Dream. \"The Great Gatsby\" is widely considered to be a literary masterpiece and a contender for the title of the Great American Novel.\nHistorical and biographical context.\nSet on the prosperous Long Island of 1922, \"The Great Gatsby\" provides a critical social history of Prohibition-era America during the Jazz Age. F. Scott Fitzgerald's fictional narrative fully renders that period\u2014known for its jazz music, economic prosperity, flapper culture, libertine mores, rebellious youth, and ubiquitous speakeasies. Fitzgerald uses many of these 1920s societal developments to tell his story, from simple details like petting in automobiles to broader themes such as bootlegging as the illicit source of Gatsby's fortune.\nFitzgerald conveys the hedonism of Jazz Age society by following a down-to-earth narrator as a spectator of the flashiest and most raucous era in American history. In Fitzgerald's eyes, the era represented a morally permissive time when Americans of all ages became disillusioned with prevailing social norms and obsessed with pleasure-seeking. Fitzgerald himself had a certain ambivalence towards the Jazz Age, an era whose themes he would later regard as reflective of events in his own life.\n\"The Great Gatsby\" reflects various events in Fitzgerald's youth. He was a young Midwesterner from Minnesota. Like the novel's narrator who went to Yale, he was educated at an Ivy League school, Princeton. There the 18-year-old Fitzgerald met Ginevra King, a 16-year-old socialite with whom he fell deeply in love. Although Ginevra was madly in love with him, her upper-class family openly discouraged his courtship of their daughter because of his lower-class status, and her father purportedly told him that \"poor boys shouldn't think of marrying rich girls\".\nRejected by Ginevra's family as a suitor because of his lack of financial prospects, a suicidal Fitzgerald enlisted in the United States Army amid World War\u00a0I and was commissioned as a second lieutenant. While awaiting deployment to the Western front where he hoped to die in combat, he was stationed at Camp Sheridan in Montgomery, Alabama, where he met Zelda Sayre, a vivacious 17-year-old Southern belle. After learning that Ginevra had married wealthy Chicago businessman William \"Bill\" Mitchell, Fitzgerald asked Zelda to marry him. Zelda agreed, but postponed their marriage until he became financially successful. Fitzgerald is thus similar to Jay Gatsby in that he became engaged while a military officer stationed far from home and then sought immense wealth in order to provide for the lifestyle to which his fianc\u00e9e had become accustomed.\nAfter his success as a short-story writer and as a novelist, Fitzgerald married Zelda in New York City, and the newly-wed couple soon relocated to Long Island. Despite enjoying the exclusive Long Island milieu, Fitzgerald quietly disapproved of the extravagant parties, and the wealthy persons he encountered often disappointed him. While striving to emulate the rich, he found their privileged lifestyle to be morally disquieting. Although Fitzgerald\u2014like Gatsby\u2014had always admired the rich, he nonetheless possessed a smoldering resentment towards them.\nPlot summary.\n George Wilson and his wife Myrtle live in the \"valley of ashes\", a refuse dump (shown in the above photograph) historically located in New York City during the 1920s. Today, the area is Flushing Meadows\u2013Corona Park.\nIn spring 1922, Nick Carraway\u2014a Yale alumnus from the Midwest and a World War\u00a0I veteran\u2014journeys to New York City to obtain employment as a bond salesman. He rents a bungalow in the Long Island village of West Egg, next to a luxurious estate inhabited by Jay Gatsby, an enigmatic multi-millionaire who hosts dazzling soir\u00e9es, yet does not partake in them.\nOne evening, Nick dines with a distant cousin, Daisy Buchanan, in the old money town of East Egg. Daisy is married to Tom Buchanan, formerly a Yale football star whom Nick knew during his college days. The couple has recently relocated from Chicago to a mansion directly across the bay from Gatsby's estate. There, Nick encounters Jordan Baker, an insolent flapper and golf champion who is a childhood friend of Daisy's. Jordan confides to Nick that Tom keeps a mistress, who brazenly telephones him at his home and lives in the \"valley of ashes\", a sprawling refuse dump. That evening, Nick sees Gatsby standing alone on his lawn, staring at a green light across the bay.\nDays later, Nick reluctantly accompanies a drunken and agitated Tom to New York City by train. En route, they stop at a garage inhabited by mechanic George Wilson and his wife\u2014and Tom's mistress\u2014Myrtle. Myrtle joins them, and the trio proceeds to a small New York apartment that Tom has rented for trysts with her. Guests arrive and a party ensues, which ends with Tom slapping Myrtle and breaking her nose after she mentions Daisy.\nOne morning, Nick receives a formal invitation to a party at Gatsby's mansion. Once there, Nick is embarrassed that he recognizes no one and begins drinking heavily until he encounters Jordan. While chatting with her, he is approached by a man who introduces himself as Jay Gatsby and insists that both he and Nick served in the 3rd\u00a0Infantry Division during the war. Gatsby attempts to ingratiate himself with Nick and when Nick leaves the party, he notices Gatsby watching him.\nIn late July, Nick and Gatsby have lunch at a speakeasy. Gatsby tries impressing Nick with tales of his war heroism and his Oxford days. Afterward, Nick meets Jordan again at the Plaza Hotel. Jordan reveals that Gatsby and Daisy met around 1917 when Gatsby was an officer in the American Expeditionary Forces. They fell in love, but when Gatsby was deployed overseas, Daisy reluctantly married Tom. Gatsby hopes that his newfound wealth and dazzling parties will make Daisy reconsider. Gatsby uses Nick to stage a reunion with Daisy, and the two embark upon an affair.\nIn September, Tom discovers the affair when Daisy carelessly addresses Gatsby with unabashed intimacy in front of him. Later, at a Plaza Hotel suite, Gatsby and Tom argue about the affair. Gatsby insists Daisy declare that she never loved Tom. Daisy claims she loves Tom and Gatsby, upsetting both. Tom reveals Gatsby is a swindler whose money comes from bootlegging alcohol. Upon hearing this, Daisy chooses to stay with Tom. Tom scornfully tells Gatsby to drive her home, knowing that Daisy will never leave him.\nWhile returning to East Egg, Gatsby and Daisy drive by Wilson's garage and their car strikes Myrtle, killing her instantly. Later Gatsby reveals to Nick that Daisy was driving the car, but that he intends to take the blame for the accident to protect her. Nick urges Gatsby to flee to avoid prosecution, but he refuses. After Tom tells George that Gatsby owns the car that struck Myrtle, a distraught George assumes the owner of the vehicle must be Myrtle's lover. George fatally shoots Gatsby in his mansion's swimming pool, then kills himself.\nSeveral days after Gatsby's murder, his father Henry Gatz arrives for the sparsely attended funeral. After Gatsby's death, Nick comes to hate New York and decides that Gatsby, Daisy, Tom, and he were all Midwesterners unsuited to Eastern life. Nick encounters Tom and initially refuses to shake his hand. Tom admits he was the one who told George that Gatsby owned the vehicle that killed Myrtle. Before returning to the Midwest, Nick returns to Gatsby's mansion and stares across the bay at the green light emanating from the end of Daisy's dock.\nMajor characters.\n Edith Cummings, a premier amateur golfer, inspired the character of Jordan Baker. A friend of Ginevra King, she was one of Chicago's famous debutantes in the Jazz Age.\nWriting and production.\nFitzgerald began outlining his third novel in June 1922. He longed to produce an exquisite work that was beautiful and intricately patterned, but the troubled production of his stage play \"The Vegetable\" repeatedly interrupted his progress. The play flopped, and Fitzgerald wrote magazine stories that winter to pay debts incurred by its production. He viewed these stories as all worthless, although included among them was \"Winter Dreams\", which Fitzgerald described as his first attempt at the Gatsby idea. \"The whole idea of Gatsby\", he later explained to a friend, \"is the unfairness of a poor young man not being able to marry a girl with money. This theme comes up again and again because I lived it\".\nIn October 1922, after the birth of their only child, Frances Scott \"Scottie\" Fitzgerald, the Fitzgeralds moved to Great Neck, New York, on Long Island. Their neighbors in Great Neck included such newly wealthy personages as writer Ring Lardner, actor Lew Fields and comedian Ed Wynn. These figures were all considered to be \"nouveau riche\", unlike those who came from Manhasset Neck, which sat across the bay from Great Neck\u2014places that were home to many of New York's wealthiest established families. This real-life juxtaposition gave Fitzgerald his idea for \"West Egg\" and \"East Egg\". In the novel, Great Neck (Kings Point) became the \"new money\" peninsula of West Egg and Port Washington (Sands Point) became the \"old money\" East Egg. Several Gold Coast mansions in the area served as inspiration for Gatsby's estate including Land's End, Oheka Castle, and the since-demolished Beacon Towers.\nWhile living on Long Island, the Fitzgeralds' enigmatic neighbor was Max Gerlach. Purportedly born in America to a German immigrant family, Gerlach had been a major in the American Expeditionary Forces during World War\u00a0I, and he later became a gentleman bootlegger who lived like a millionaire in New York. Flaunting his new wealth, Gerlach threw lavish parties, never wore the same shirt twice, used the phrase \"old sport\", and fostered myths about himself, including that he was a relation of the German Kaiser. These details about Gerlach inspired Fitzgerald in his creation of Jay Gatsby.\nDuring this same time period, the daily newspapers sensationalized the Hall\u2013Mills murder case over many months, and the highly publicized case likely influenced the plot of Fitzgerald's novel. The case involved the double-murder of a man and his lover on September\u00a014, 1922, mere weeks before Fitzgerald arrived in Great Neck. Scholars have speculated that Fitzgerald based certain aspects of the ending of \"The Great Gatsby\" and various characterizations on this factual incident.\nInspired by the Hall\u2013Mills case, the mysterious persona of Gerlach and the riotous parties he attended on Long Island, Fitzgerald had written 18,000 words for his novel by mid-1923, but discarded most of his new story as a false start. Some of this early draft resurfaced in the 1924 short story \"Absolution\". In earlier drafts, Daisy was originally named Ada and Nick was Dud, and the two characters had shared a previous romance prior to their reunion on Long Island. These earlier drafts were written from the viewpoint of an omniscient narrator as opposed to Nick's perspective. A key difference in earlier drafts is a less complete failure of Gatsby's dream. Another difference is that the argument between Tom Buchanan and Gatsby is more balanced, although Daisy still returns to Tom.\nWork on \"The Great Gatsby\" resumed in earnest in April 1924. Fitzgerald decided to depart from the writing process of his previous novels and told Perkins that he was intent on creating an artistic achievement. He wished to eschew the realism of his previous two novels and to compose a creative work of sustained imagination. To this end, he consciously imitated the literary styles of Joseph Conrad and Willa Cather. He was particularly influenced by Cather's 1923 work, \"A Lost Lady,\" which features a wealthy married socialite pursued by a variety of romantic suitors and who symbolically embodies the American dream. He later wrote a letter to Cather apologizing for any unintentional plagiarism. During this period of revisions, Scott saw and was influenced by early sketches for the book's dust jacket art. Soon after this burst of effort, work slowed while the Fitzgeralds moved to the Villa Marie in Saint-Rapha\u00ebl on the French Riviera, where a marital crisis soon developed.\nDespite his ongoing marital tension, Fitzgerald continued to write steadily and submitted a near-final version of the manuscript to his editor, Maxwell Perkins, on October\u00a027. Perkins informed him in a November letter that Gatsby was too vague as a character and that his wealth and business, respectively, needed a convincing explanation. Fitzgerald thanked Perkins for his detailed criticisms and claimed that such feedback would enable him to perfect the manuscript. Having relocated with his wife to Rome, Fitzgerald made revisions to the manuscript throughout the winter.\nContent after a few rounds of revision, Fitzgerald submitted the final version in February 1925. Fitzgerald's alterations included extensive revisions of the sixth and eighth chapters. He declined an offer of $10,000 for the serial rights to the book so that it could be published sooner. He received a $3,939 advance in 1923 and would receive $1,981.25 upon publication.\nAlternative titles.\nFitzgerald had difficulty choosing a title for his novel and entertained many choices before reluctantly deciding on \"The Great Gatsby\", a title inspired by Alain-Fournier's \"Le Grand Meaulnes\". Previously he had shifted between \"Among Ash Heaps and Millionaires\", \"Trimalchio\", \"Trimalchio in West Egg\", \"On the Road to West Egg\", \"Under the Red, White, and Blue\", \"The Gold-Hatted Gatsby\", and \"The High-Bouncing Lover\". The titles \"The Gold-Hatted Gatsby\" and \"The High-Bouncing Lover\" came from Fitzgerald's epigraph for the novel, one which he wrote himself under the pen name of Thomas Parke D'Invilliers.\nFitzgerald initially preferred titles referencing Trimalchio, the crude upstart in Petronius's \"Satyricon\", and even refers to Gatsby as Trimalchio once in the novel.\nUnlike Gatsby's spectacular parties, Trimalchio participated in the orgies he hosted but, according to literary critic Tony Tanner, there are subtle similarities between the two characters. By November 1924, Fitzgerald wrote to Perkins that he had settled upon the title of \"Trimalchio in West Egg\".\nDisliking Fitzgerald's chosen title of \"Trimalchio in West Egg\", editor Max Perkins persuaded him that the reference was too obscure and that people would be unable to pronounce it. Zelda and Perkins both expressed their preference for \"The Great Gatsby\", and the next month Fitzgerald agreed. A month before publication, after a final review of the proofs, he asked if it would be possible to re-title it \"Trimalchio\" or \"Gold-Hatted Gatsby\", but Perkins advised against it. On March\u00a019, 1925, Fitzgerald expressed enthusiasm for the title \"Under the Red, White, and Blue\", but it was too late to change it at that stage. The novel was published as \"The Great Gatsby\" on April 10, 1925. Fitzgerald believed the book's final title to be merely acceptable and often expressed his ambivalence with the name.\nDust jacket art.\nThe artwork for the first edition of \"The Great Gatsby,\" known as \"Celestial Eyes,\" is among the most celebrated in American literature and represents a unique instance in literary history in which a novel's commissioned artwork directly influenced the composition of the text. Rendered in an Art Deco visual style, the artwork depicts the disembodied face of a Jazz Age flapper with celestial eyes and rouged mouth over a dark blue skyline. A little-known Barcelonan painter named Francis Cugat\u2014born Francisco Coradal-Cougat\u2014was commissioned by an unknown individual in Scribner's art department to illustrate the cover while Fitzgerald was composing the novel.\nIn a preliminary sketch, Cugat drew a concept of a dismal gray landscape inspired by Fitzgerald's original title for the novel, \"Among Ash Heaps and Millionaires\". Discarding this gloomy concept, Cugat next drew a divergent study which became the prefiguration to the final cover: A pencil and crayon drawing of a flapper's half-hidden visage over Long Island Sound with scarlet lips, one celestial eye, and a single diagonal tear. Expanding upon this study, his subsequent drawing featured two bright eyes looming over a shadowy New York cityscape. In later iterations, Cugat replaced the shadowy cityscape with dazzling carnival lights evoking a Ferris wheel and likely referencing the glittering amusement park at New York's Coney Island. Cugat affixed reclining nudes within the flapper's irises and added a green tint to the streaming tear. Cugat's final cover, which Max Perkins hailed as a masterpiece, was the only work he completed for Scribner's and the only book cover he ever designed.\nAlthough Fitzgerald likely never saw the final gouache painting prior to the novel's publication, Cugat's preparatory drafts influenced his writing. Upon viewing Cugat's drafts before sailing for France in April\u2013May 1924, Fitzgerald was so enamored that he later told editor Max Perkins that he had incorporated Cugat's imagery into the novel. This statement has led many to analyze interrelations between Cugat's art and Fitzgerald's text. One popular interpretation is that the celestial eyes are reminiscent of those of optometrist T. J. Eckleburg depicted on a faded commercial billboard near George Wilson's auto repair shop. Author Ernest Hemingway supported this latter interpretation and claimed that Fitzgerald had told him the cover referred to a billboard in the valley of the ashes. Although this passage has some resemblance to the imagery, a closer explanation can be found in Fitzgerald's explicit description of Daisy Buchanan as the \"girl whose disembodied face floated along the dark cornices and blinding signs\".\nCritical reception.\nInitial reviews.\nCharles Scribner's Sons published \"The Great Gatsby\" on April 10, 1925. Fitzgerald cabled Perkins the day after publication to monitor reviews: \"Any news?\" \"Sales situation doubtful [but] excellent reviews\", read a telegram from Perkins on April 20. Fitzgerald responded on April\u00a024, saying the cable dispirited him, closing the letter with \"Yours in great depression\". Fitzgerald soon received letters from contemporaries Willa Cather, Edith Wharton, and poet T. S. Eliot praising the novel. Although gratified by such correspondence, Fitzgerald sought public acclaim from professional critics.\n\"The Great Gatsby\" received generally favorable reviews from literary critics of the day. Edwin Clark of \"The New York Times\" felt the novel was a mystical and glamorous tale of the Jazz Age. Similarly, Lillian C. Ford of the \"Los Angeles Times\" hailed the novel as a revelatory work of art that \"leaves the reader in a mood of chastened wonder\". The \"New York Post\" described Fitzgerald's prose style as scintillating and genuinely brilliant. The \"New York Herald Tribune\" was less impressed, referring to \"The Great Gatsby\" as \"a literary lemon meringue\" that nonetheless \"contains some of the nicest little touches of contemporary observation you could imagine\u2014so light, so delicate, so sharp\". In \"The Chicago Daily Tribune\", H. L. Mencken judged the work's plot to be highly improbable, although he praised the writing as elegant and the \"careful and brilliant finish\".\nSeveral reviewers felt the novel left much to be desired following Fitzgerald's previous works and criticized him accordingly. Harvey Eagleton of \"The Dallas Morning News\" predicted that the novel signaled the end of Fitzgerald's artistic success. Ralph Coghlan of the \"St. Louis Post-Dispatch\" dismissed the work as an inconsequential performance by a once-promising author who had grown bored and cynical. Ruth Snyder of \"New York Evening World\" lambasted the book's style as painfully forced and declared the editors of her newspaper were \"quite convinced after reading \"The Great Gatsby\" that Mr. Fitzgerald is not one of the great American writers of today\". John McClure of \"The Times-Picayune\" insisted the plot was implausible and the book itself seemed raw in its construction.\nAfter reading these reviews, Fitzgerald believed that many critics misunderstood the novel. He despaired that \"of all the reviews, even the most enthusiastic, not one had the slightest idea what the book was about\". In particular, Fitzgerald resented criticisms of the novel's plot as implausible since he had never intended for the story to be realistic. Instead, he crafted the work to be a romanticized depiction that was largely scenic and symbolic. According to his friend John Peale Bishop, Fitzgerald further resented the fact that critics failed to perceive the many parallels between the author's life and the character of Jay Gatsby; in particular, that both created a mythical version of themselves and attempted to live up to this legend. Dispirited by critics failing to understand the novel, Fitzgerald remained hopeful that the novel would at least be a commercial success, perhaps selling as many as 75,000 copies.\nTo Fitzgerald's great disappointment, \"Gatsby\" was a commercial failure in comparison with his previous efforts, \"This Side of Paradise\" (1920) and \"The Beautiful and Damned\" (1922). By October, the book had sold fewer than 20,000 copies.\nAlthough the novel went through two initial printings, many copies remained unsold years later. Fitzgerald attributed the poor sales to the fact that women tended to be the primary audience for novels during this time, and \"Gatsby\" did not contain an admirable female character. According to his ledger, he earned only $2,000 from the book. Although Owen Davis' 1926 stage adaptation and the Paramount-issued silent film version brought in money for the author, Fitzgerald lamented that the novel fell far short of the success he had hoped for and would not bring him recognition as a serious novelist in the public eye. With the onset of the Great Depression, \"The Great Gatsby\" was regarded as little more than a nostalgic period piece. By the time Fitzgerald died in 1940, the novel had fallen into near obscurity.\nRevival and reassessment.\nIn 1940, Fitzgerald suffered a third and fatal heart attack and died believing his work forgotten. His obituary in \"The New York Times\" hailed him as a brilliant novelist and cited \"Gatsby\" as his greatest work. In the wake of Fitzgerald's death, a strong appreciation for the book gradually developed in writers' circles. Future authors Budd Schulberg and Edward Newhouse were deeply affected by it, and John O'Hara acknowledged its influence on his work. By the time that \"Gatsby\" was republished in Edmund Wilson's edition of \"The Last Tycoon\" in 1941, the prevailing opinion in writers' circles deemed the novel to be an enduring work of fiction.\nIn the spring of 1942, mere months after the United States' entrance into World War\u00a0II, an association of publishing executives created the Council on Books in Wartime with the stated purpose of distributing paperback Armed Services Editions books to combat troops. \"The Great Gatsby\" was one of them. Within the next several years, 155,000 copies of \"Gatsby\" were distributed to U.S. soldiers overseas, and the book proved popular among beleaguered troops, according to the \"Saturday Evening Post\"'s 1945 report.\nBy 1944, a full-scale Fitzgerald revival had occurred. Full-length scholarly articles on Fitzgerald's works were being published in periodicals and, by the following year, the earlier consensus among professional critics that \"The Great Gatsby\" was merely a sensational story or a nostalgic period piece had effectively vanished. The tireless promotional efforts of literary critic Edmund Wilson, who was Fitzgerald's Princeton classmate and his close friend, led this Fitzgerald revival. In 1951, three years after Zelda's death in a hospital fire, Professor Arthur Mizener of Cornell University published \"The Far Side of Paradise\", the first biography of Fitzgerald. Mizener's bestselling biography emphasized \"The Great Gatsby\"'s positive reception by literary critics, which may have further influenced public opinion and renewed interest in it.\nBy 1960\u2014thirty-five years after the novel's original publication\u2014the book was steadily selling 100,000 copies per year. Renewed interest in it led \"The New York Times\" editorialist Mizener to proclaim the novel was a masterwork of 20th-century American literature. By 1974, \"The Great Gatsby\" had attained its status as a literary masterwork and was deemed a contender for the title of the \"Great American Novel\".\nBy the mid-2000s, many literary critics considered \"The Great Gatsby\" to be one of the greatest novels ever written, and the work was part of the assigned curricula in the near majority of U.S. high schools. As of early 2020, \"The Great Gatsby\" had sold almost 30 million copies worldwide and continues to sell an additional 500,000 copies annually. Numerous foreign editions of the novel have been published, and the text has been translated into 42 different languages. The work is Scribner's most popular title; in 2013, the e-book alone sold 185,000 copies. The American Library Association lists the book as among the most challenged classics in U.S. literature. The novel's U.S. copyright expired on January 1, 2021, when it, along with all the other literature of 1925, entered the public domain. Since then, numerous altered and incomplete reprints have flooded the market.\nCritical analysis.\nMajor themes.\nThe American Dream.\nFollowing the novel's revival, later critical writings on \"The Great Gatsby\" focused on Fitzgerald's disillusionment with the American Dream in the hedonistic Jazz Age, a name for the era which Fitzgerald claimed to have coined. In 1970, scholar Roger L. Pearson asserted that Fitzgerald's work\u2014more so than other twentieth century novels\u2014is especially linked with this conceptualization of the American dream. Pearson traced the literary origins of this dream to Colonial America. The dream is the belief that every individual, regardless of their origins, may seek and achieve their desired goals, \"be they political, monetary, or social. It is the literary expression of the concept of America: The land of opportunity\".\nHowever, Pearson noted that Fitzgerald's particular treatment of this theme is devoid of the discernible optimism in the writings of earlier American authors. He suggests Gatsby serves as a false prophet of the American dream, and pursuing the dream only results in dissatisfaction for those who chase it, owing to its unattainability. In this analytical context, the green light on the Buchanans' dock (visible across Long Island Sound from Gatsby's house) is frequently interpreted as a symbol of Gatsby's unrealizable goal to win Daisy and, consequently, to achieve the American Dream. Also, scholar Sarah Churchwell points out that adultery in the novel is linked to the loss of faith and broken promises, which symbolizes the corruption of the American Dream.\nClass permanence.\nScholars and writers commonly ascribe Gatsby's inability to achieve the American Dream to entrenched class disparities in American society. The novel underscores the limits of the American lower class to transcend their station of birth. Scholar Sarah Churchwell contends that Fitzgerald's novel is a tale of class warfare in a status-obsessed country that refuses to acknowledge publicly it even has a class system.\nAlthough scholars posit different explanations for the continuation of class differences in the United States, there is a consensus regarding the novel's message in conveying its underlying permanence. Although \"Gatsby\"'s fundamental conflict occurs between entrenched sources of socio-economic power and upstarts like Gatsby who threaten their interests, Fitzgerald's novel shows that a class permanence persists despite the country's capitalist economy that prizes innovation and adaptability. Dianne Bechtel argues Fitzgerald plotted the novel to illustrate that class transcends wealth in America. Even if the poorer Americans become rich, they remain inferior to those Americans with \"old money\". Consequently, Gatsby and other characters in the novel are trapped in a rigid American class system.\nGender relations.\nBesides exploring the difficulties of achieving the American dream, \"The Great Gatsby\" explores societal gender expectations during the Jazz Age. The character of Daisy Buchanan has been identified specifically as personifying the emerging cultural archetype of the flapper. Flappers were typically young, modern women who bobbed their hair and wore short skirts. They also drank\u00a0alcohol and had premarital sex.\nDespite the newfound societal freedoms attained by flappers in the 1920s, Fitzgerald's work critically examines the continued limitations upon women's agency during this period. In this context, although early critics viewed the character of Daisy to be a \"monster of bitchery\", later scholars such as Leland S. Person Jr. asserted that Daisy's character exemplifies the marginalization of women in the elite social environment that Fitzgerald depicts.\nWriting in 1978, Person noted Daisy is more of a hapless victim than a manipulative victimizer. She is the target first of Tom's callous domination and next of Gatsby's dehumanizing adoration. She involuntarily becomes the holy grail at the center of Gatsby's unrealistic quest to be steadfast to a youthful concept of himself. The ensuing contest of wills between Tom and Gatsby reduces Daisy to a trophy wife whose sole existence is to augment her possessor's socio-economic success.\nAs an upper-class white woman living in East Egg during this time period, Daisy must adhere to societal expectations and gender norms such as actively fulfilling the roles of dutiful wife, nurturing mother, and charming socialite. Many of Daisy's choices\u2014ultimately culminating in the fatal car crash and misery for all those involved\u2014can be partly attributed to her prescribed role as a \"beautiful little fool\" who is reliant on her husband for financial and societal security. Her decision to remain with her husband, despite her feelings for Gatsby, is because of the security that her marriage to Tom Buchanan provides.\nRace and displacement.\nMany scholars have analyzed the novel's treatment of race and displacement; in particular, a perceived threat posed by newer immigrants to older Americans, triggering concerns over a loss of socio-economic status. In one instance, Tom Buchanan\u2014the novel's antagonist\u2014claims that he, Nick, and Jordan are racially superior Nordics. Tom decries immigration and advocates white supremacy. A fictional book alluded to by Tom is Goddard's \"The Rise of the Colored Empires\", which is a parody by Fitzgerald of Lothrop Stoddard's \"The Rising Tide of Color,\" a 1920s bestseller. Stoddard warned that immigration would alter America's racial composition and destroy the country.\nAnalyzing these elements, literary theorist Walter Benn Michaels contends that Fitzgerald's novel reflects a historical period in American literature characterized by fears over the influx of Southern and Eastern European immigrants whose \"otherness\" challenged Americans' sense of national identity. Such anxieties were more salient in national discourse than the societal consequences of World War\u00a0I, and the defining question of the period was who constituted \"a real American\".\nIn this context of immigration and displacement, Tom's hostility towards Gatsby, who is the embodiment of \"latest America\", has been interpreted as partly embodying status anxieties of the time involving anti-immigrant sentiment. Gatsby\u2014whom Tom belittles as \"Mr. Nobody from Nowhere\"\u2014functions as a cipher because of his obscure origins, his unclear ethno-religious identity and his indeterminate class status. Although his ethnicity is vague, his last name Gatz and his father's adherence to the Lutheran religion indicate his family are recent German immigrants. This would preclude them from the coveted status of Old Stock Americans. Consequently, Gatsby's socio-economic ascent is deemed a threat not only due to his status as \"nouveau riche\", but because he is perceived as an outsider.\nBecause of such themes, \"The Great Gatsby\" captures the perennial American experience as it is a story about change and those who resist it\u2014whether such change comes in the form of a new wave of immigrants, the \"nouveau riche\", or successful minorities. Since Americans living in the 1920s to the present are largely defined by their fluctuating socio-economic circumstances and must navigate a society with entrenched racial and ethnic prejudices, Fitzgerald's depiction of resultant status anxieties and social conflict has been highlighted by scholars as still enduringly relevant nearly a hundred years after the novel's publication.\nSexuality and identity.\nQuestions regarding the sexuality of characters have been raised for decades and\u2014augmented by biographical details about the author\u2014have given rise to queer readings. During his lifetime, Fitzgerald's sexuality became a subject of debate among his friends and acquaintances. As a youth, Fitzgerald had a close relationship with Father Sigourney Fay, a possibly gay Catholic priest, and Fitzgerald later used his last name for the idealized romantic character of Daisy Fay. After college, Fitzgerald cross-dressed during outings in Minnesota. Years later, while drafting \"The Great Gatsby\", rumors dogged Fitzgerald among the American expat community in Paris that he was gay. Soon after, Fitzgerald's wife Zelda Fitzgerald likewise doubted his heterosexuality and asserted that he was a closeted homosexual. She publicly belittled him with homophobic slurs, and she alleged that Fitzgerald and fellow writer Ernest Hemingway engaged in homosexual relations. These incidents strained the Fitzgeralds' marriage at the time of the novel's publication.\nAlthough Fitzgerald's sexuality is a subject of scholarly debate, such biographical details lent credence to critical interpretations that his fictional characters are either gay or bisexual surrogates. As early as 1945, critics such as Lionel Trilling noted that characters in \"The Great Gatsby\", such as Jordan Baker, were implied to be \"vaguely homosexual\", and, in 1960, writer Otto Friedrich commented upon the ease of examining the thwarted relations depicted in Fitzgerald's fiction through a queer lens. In recent decades, scholarship has focused sharply on the sexuality of Nick Carraway. In one instance in the novel, Carraway departs a drunken orgy with a \"pale, feminine\" man named Mr. McKee and\u2014following suggestive ellipses\u2014Nick next finds himself standing beside a bed while McKee sits between the sheets clad only in his underwear. Such scenes have led scholars to describe Nick as possessing an overt queerness and prompted analyses about his emotional attachment to Jay Gatsby. For these reasons, the novel has been described as an exploration of sexual identity during a historical era typified by the societal transition towards modernity.\nTechnology and environment.\nTechnological and environmental criticisms of \"Gatsby\" seek to place the novel and its characters in a broader historical context. In 1964, Leo Marx argued in \"The Machine in the Garden\" that Fitzgerald's work evinces a tension between a complex pastoral ideal of a bygone America and the societal transformations caused by industrialization and machine technology. Specifically, the valley of the ashes, in between East and West Egg, represents a man-made wasteland which is a byproduct of the industrialization that has made Gatsby's booming lifestyle, including his automobile, possible. Marx argues that Fitzgerald, via Nick, expresses a pastoral longing typical of other 1920s American writers like William Faulkner and Ernest Hemingway. Although such writers cherish the pastoral ideal, they accept that technological progress has deprived this ideal of nearly all meaning. In this context, Nick's repudiation of the eastern United States represents a futile attempt to withdraw into nature. Yet, as Fitzgerald's work shows, any technological demarcation between the eastern and western United States has vanished, and one cannot escape into a pastoral past.\nIn 2018, scholar Kyle Keeler argued that the voracious pursuit of wealth as criticized in Fitzgerald's novel offers a warning about the perils of environmental destruction in pursuit of self-interest. According to Kyle Keeler, Gatsby's quest for greater status manifests as self-centered, anthropocentric resource acquisition. Inspired by the predatory mining practices of his fictional mentor Dan Cody, Gatsby participates in extensive deforestation amid World War\u00a0I and then undertakes bootlegging activities reliant upon exploiting South American agriculture. Gatsby conveniently ignores the wasteful devastation of the valley of ashes to pursue a consumerist lifestyle and exacerbates the wealth gap that became increasingly salient in 1920s America. For these reasons, Keeler argues that\u2014while Gatsby's socioeconomic ascent and self-transformation depend upon these very factors\u2014each one is nonetheless partially responsible for the ongoing ecological crisis.\nAntisemitism.\n Fitzgerald based the character of Meyer Wolfsheim on Jazz Age racketeer Arnold Rothstein (\"pictured above\") who was murdered in 1928.\n\"The Great Gatsby\" has been accused of antisemitism because of its use of stereotypes of Jews. One of the novel's supporting characters is Meyer Wolfsheim, a Jewish friend and mentor of Gatsby. A corrupt profiteer who assists Gatsby's bootlegging operations and who fixed the 1919 World Series, he appears only twice in the novel, the second time refusing to attend Gatsby's funeral. Fitzgerald describes Wolfsheim as \"a small, flat-nosed Jew\", with \"tiny eyes\" and \"two fine growths of hair\" in his nostrils. Evoking ethnic stereotypes regarding the Jewish nose, he describes Wolfsheim's nose as \"expressive\", \"tragic\", and able to \"flash\u00a0... indignantly\". The fictional character of Wolfsheim is an allusion to real-life Jewish gambler Arnold Rothstein, a notorious New York crime kingpin whom Fitzgerald met once in undetermined circumstances. Rothstein was blamed for match fixing in the Black Sox Scandal that tainted the 1919 World Series.\nWolfsheim has been interpreted as representing the Jewish miser stereotype. Richard Levy, author of \"Antisemitism: A Historical Encyclopedia of Prejudice and Persecution\", claims that Wolfsheim serves to link Jewishness with corruption. In a 1947 article for \"Commentary\", Milton Hindus, an assistant professor of humanities at the University of Chicago, stated that while he believed the book was a superb literary achievement, Wolfsheim was its most abrasive character, and the work contains an antisemitic undertone. Hindus argued the Jewish stereotypes displayed by Wolfsheim were typical of the time when the novel was written and set and that its antisemitism was of the \"habitual, customary, 'harmless,' unpolitical variety\". A 2015 article by essayist Arthur Krystal agreed with Hindus' assessment that Fitzgerald's use of Jewish caricatures was not driven by malice and merely reflected commonly held beliefs of his time. He notes the accounts of Frances Kroll, a Jewish woman and secretary to Fitzgerald, who claimed that Fitzgerald was hurt by accusations of antisemitism and responded to critiques of Wolfsheim by claiming he merely \"fulfilled a function in the story and had nothing to do with race or religion\".\nAdaptations.\nPlays.\nThe first stage adaptation was produced by William Brady, a veteran theatrical impresario and promoter of prize fights, who acquired the rights only a few days after first reading the novel in early 1925. The script was written by the American dramatist Owen Davis, who had won a Pulitzer Prize in 1923 for his play, \"Icebound\". Davis dramatically altered the structure of the novel, rearranging the action in chronological order, eliminating prominent elements such as the valley of ashes and the scene in the Plaza Hotel, and inventing minor characters.\nThe play, directed by George Cukor and starring James Rennie as Gatsby and Florence Eldridge as Daisy, opened at the Ambassador Theatre \non Broadway on February 2, 1926. It was well received by critics and the public, and the run was extended past the originally scheduled closing date, finally ending on May 22, after 112 performances. The production, with some changes in the cast, then moved to Chicago, where it opened on August 1. Its popularity again led to an extension of the run, which came to an end in late September. A brief one-week return engagement at New York's Shubert Theater began on October 4, after which a road production traveled to several other cities, including Baltimore, Philadelphia, Detroit, St. Louis, Denver, and Minneapolis.\nIn July 2006, a stage adaptation written by Simon Levy and directed by David Esbjornson premiered at the Guthrie Theater in Minneapolis to celebrate the opening of its new building. In 2010, critic Ben Brantley of \"The New York Times\" highly praised the debut of \"Gatz\", an Off-Broadway staging of the novel's full text by Elevator Repair Service. The New York Metropolitan Opera commissioned John Harbison to compose an operatic treatment of the novel to commemorate the 25th anniversary of James Levine's debut. The work, called \"The Great Gatsby\", premiered on December 20, 1999.\nThe novel has also been adapted for ballet performances. In 2009, BalletMet premiered a version at the Capitol Theatre in Columbus, Ohio. In 2010, The Washington Ballet premiered a version at the Kennedy Center. The show received an encore run the following year.\nFilm.\nThe first film version of the novel appeared in 1926. A version of Owen Davis's Broadway play of the same year, it was directed by Herbert Brenon and starred Warner Baxter, Lois Wilson and William Powell. It is a famous example of a lost film. Reviews suggest it may have been the most faithful adaptation of the novel, but a trailer of the film at the National Archives is all that is known to exist. Reportedly, Fitzgerald and his wife Zelda loathed the silent version. Zelda wrote to an acquaintance that the film was \"rotten\". She and Fitzgerald left the cinema midway through the film.\nFollowing the 1926 film was 1949's \"The Great Gatsby\", directed by Elliott Nugent and starring Alan Ladd, Betty Field and Macdonald Carey. Twenty-five years later in 1974, \"The Great Gatsby\" appeared onscreen again. It was directed by Jack Clayton and starred Robert Redford as Gatsby, Mia Farrow as Daisy, and Sam Waterston as Nick Carraway. Most recently, \"The Great Gatsby\" was directed by Baz Luhrmann in 2013 and starred Leonardo DiCaprio as Gatsby, Carey Mulligan as Daisy, and Tobey Maguire as Nick.\nIn 2021, visual effects company DNEG Animation announced they would be producing an animated film adaptation of the novel directed by William Joyce and written by Brian Selznick.\nTelevision.\n\"Gatsby\" has been retold as a short-form television movie multiple times. The first was in 1955 as an NBC episode for \"Robert Montgomery Presents\" starring Robert Montgomery, Phyllis Kirk, and Lee Bowman. The episode was directed by Alvin Sapinsley. In 1958, CBS filmed another adaptation as an episode of \"Playhouse 90\", also titled \"The Great Gatsby,\" which was directed by Franklin J. Schaffner and starred Robert Ryan, Jeanne Crain and Rod Taylor. Most recently, the novel was adapted as an A&amp;E movie in 2000. \"The Great Gatsby\" was directed by Robert Markowitz and starred Toby Stephens as Gatsby, Mira Sorvino as Daisy, and Paul Rudd as Nick.\nMusicals.\nThe Yale Dramatic Association performed the first musical production of \"The Great Gatsby\" in Summer 1956. For the production, Aubrey L. Goodman adapted Fitzgerald's novel and wrote the lyrics for 14 songs by composer Robert E. Morgan. The show was performed in the University Theatre at Yale University to sold-out performances. After the Yale production, a number of musical adaptations followed.\nA second musical adaptation debuted in Spring 1998, undertaken by Stage One, with Colin Stevens as Gatsby and Ann Marcuson as Jordan Baker. Directed by Phil Smith with an original score by Thomas Johnson, this jazz adaptation premiered at the Pavilion Theatre in Rhyl, Wales. As a jazz adaptation, Johnson's original score emphasized saxophone and brass sextet instruments.\nIn 2023, the third musical adaptation, with music and lyrics by Jason Howland and Nathan Tysen and a book by Kait Kerrigan began a one-month limited engagement at the Paper Mill Playhouse. The Broadway tryout began its previews on October 12, 2023, followed by an official opening night scheduled for ten days later. The production concluded on November 12 of the same year. Jeremy Jordan and Eva Noblezada starred as the leading roles of Jay Gatsby and Daisy Buchanan, with Samantha Pauly and Noah J. Ricketts as Jordan Baker and Nick Carraway. The production transferred to Broadway for previews on March 29, 2024, and opened officially on April 25th, 2024.\nIn Spring 2024, \"\", a fourth musical adaptation with music and lyrics by Florence Welch and Thomas Bartlett and a book by Martyna Majok premiered at the American Repertory Theater. The production starred Isaac Cole Powell as Jay Gatsby and Ben Levi Ross as Nick Carraway. On May 25, 2024, the show began previews and opened officially on June 5 of the same year. It closed on August 3rd, 2024.\nLiterature.\nSince entering the public domain in 2021, retellings and expansions of \"The Great Gatsby\" have become legal to publish. \"Nick\" by Michael Farris Smith (2021) imagines the backstory of Nick Carraway. That same year saw the publication of \"The Chosen and the Beautiful\" by Nghi Vo, a retelling with elements of the fantasy genre while tackling issues of race and sexuality, and \"The Pursued and the Pursuing\" by AJ Odasso, a queer partial retelling and sequel in which Jay Gatsby survives. Anna-Marie McLemore's own queer retelling, \"Self-Made Boys: A Great Gatsby Remix\", was released in 2022 and was longlisted for the National Book Award for Young People's Literature.\nRadio.\nThe novel has been adapted into a series of radio episodes. The first radio episode was a 1950 half-hour-long adaptation for CBS' \"Family Hour of Stars\" starring Kirk Douglas as Gatsby. The novel was read aloud by the BBC World Service in ten parts in 2008. In a 2012 BBC Radio 4 broadcast, \"The Great Gatsby\" took the form of a Classic Serial dramatization. It was created by dramatist Robert Forrest.\nVideo games.\nIn 2010, Oberon Media released a casual hidden object game called \"Classic Adventures: The Great Gatsby\". In 2011, developer Charlie Hoey and editor Pete Smith created an 8-bit-style online game of \"The Great Gatsby\" called \"The Great Gatsby for NES\"; in 2022, after the discontinuation of Adobe Flash, they adapted this game to an actual NES ROM file, which can also be played on their website.

Wellman\nThe Public Enemy (Enemies of the Public in the UK) is a 1931 American pre-Code gangster film produced and distributed by Warner Bros. The film was directed by William A. Wellman, and starring James Cagney, Jean Harlow, Edward Woods, Donald Cook and Joan Blondell. The film relates the story of a young man's rise in the criminal underworld in Prohibition-era urban America. The supporting players include Beryl Mercer, Murray Kinnell, and Mae Clarke. The screenplay is based on an unpublished novel\u2014\"Beer and Blood\" by two former newspapermen, John Bright and Kubec Glasmon\u2014who had witnessed some of Al Capone's murderous gang rivalries in Chicago.\nIn 1998, \"The Public Enemy\" was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".\nPlot.\nAs youngsters in 1900s Chicago, Irish-Americans Tom Powers and his lifelong friend Matt Doyle engage in petty theft, selling stolen items to \"Putty Nose\". Putty Nose persuades them to join his gang on a fur warehouse robbery, assuring them he will take care of them if anything goes wrong. When Tom is startled by a taxidermied bear, he shoots it, alerting the police, who kill gang member Larry Dalton. When they go to Putty Nose for help, they find he has fled.\nTom's straitlaced older brother Mike Powers tries and fails to talk Tom into giving up crime. Tom keeps his activities secret from his doting mother. When the United States enters World War I in 1917, Mike enlists in the Marines. Their mother pleads with Tom not to do the same, and he promises, staying behind.\nIn 1920, with Prohibition about to go into effect, Paddy Ryan recruits Tom and Matt as beer \"salesmen\" (enforcers) in his bootlegging business. He allies himself with noted gangster Samuel \"Nails\" Nathan. As the bootlegging business becomes ever more lucrative, Tom and Matt flaunt their wealth.\nMike finds out that his brother's money comes not from politics, as Tom claims, but from bootlegging, and declares that Tom's success is based on nothing more than \"beer and blood\". Tom retorts in disgust: \"Your hands ain't so clean. You killed and liked it. You didn't get them medals for holding hands with them Germans.\"\nTom and Matt acquire girlfriends, Kitty and Mamie, respectively. Tom eventually tires of Kitty; when she complains once too often, he angrily pushes half a grapefruit into her face. He then drops her for Gwen Allen. At a restaurant on the night of Matt's wedding reception to Mamie, Tom and Matt recognize Putty Nose and follow him home. Begging for his life, Putty plays a song on the piano that he had entertained Tom and Matt with when they were children. Tom shoots him in the back, while a dazed Matt watches.\nTom gives his mother a large wad of money, but Mike rejects the gift. Tom tears up the banknotes and throws them in his brother's face. \"Nails\" Nathan dies in a horse-riding accident, prompting Tom to buy the horse and shoot it. A rival gang headed by \"Schemer\" Burns takes advantage of the disarray resulting from Nathan's death, precipitating a gang war.\nLater, Matt is gunned down in public, with Tom narrowly escaping the same fate. Furious, Tom takes it upon himself to single-handedly settle scores with Burns and some of his men. Tom is seriously wounded in the shootout and ends up in the hospital. When his mother, brother, and Matt's sister Molly come to see him, he reconciles with Mike and agrees to reform. However, Paddy warns Mike that Tom has been kidnapped by the Burns mob from the hospital. A member of the Paddy gang telephones Mike to say Tom is returning from the hospital; their mother is overjoyed and begins preparing Tom's bedroom. When Mike answers a knock on the door, Tom's tied-up body is propped against it, and he falls dead onto the floor. The film closes with Mike walking slowly towards the camera.\nCast.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-begin/styles.css\"/&gt;\nProduction.\nDevelopment.\nThe screenplay, which was written by Harvey F. Thew, was based on an unpublished novel, \"Beer and Blood\", by John Bright and Kubec Glasmon. Bright and Glasmon based their novel on actual people, having witnessed some of Al Capone's murderous gang rivalries in Chicago. Warner Bros. studio head Jack L. Warner bought the rights to the novel and assigned director William A. Wellman to direct the film. Wellman, who had served in World War I, like the brother of the main character, told Warner: \"I'll bring you the toughest, most violent picture you ever did see\".\nCasting.\nEdward Woods was originally cast in the lead role of Tom Powers and James Cagney was cast as Tom's best friend Matt Doyle, until director Wellman decided Cagney would be more effective in the part and switched the two actors but never reshot the sequences with the characters as children, which is why the child playing Cagney's role looks like Woods while the one playing Woods' role looks like Cagney. Another reason for the switch is that the sound technology used in \"The Public Enemy\" was superior to that used in earlier films, making it no longer imperative to have an actor in the lead role who had impeccable enunciation.\nLouise Brooks was the original choice for Gwen Allen, a woman with self-confessed weakness for bad men. She refused the role, which went to a younger actress, Jean Harlow. Brooks' name was in studio records/casting call lists playing \"Bess\" in this movie, but she and her character did not appear. Brooks later explained herself to Wellman (who had directed her in \"Beggars of Life\" (1928)) by saying that she hated making pictures because she simply \"hated Hollywood\". In the opinion of Brooks's biographer Barry Paris, \"turning down \"Public Enemy\" marked the real end of Louise Brooks's film career\".\nTom's first girlfriend Kitty was played by Mae Clarke, who was uncredited. Kitty is eventually dumped by Tom for Gwen after he pushes half a grapefruit into her face, the most famous scene in the movie. Joan Blondell played Mamie, Matt's girlfriend. She had already worked with Cagney in \"Sinners' Holiday\" (1930) and would work with him on two films which also came out this year: \"Other Men's Women\" and \"Blonde Crazy\". Other films that they worked together on were \"The Crowd Roars\" (1932), \"Footlight Parade\" (1933) and \"He Was Her Man\" (1934). Cagney once said that Blondell was the only woman he loved besides his wife. Donald Cook played Tom's brother, Mike.\nFilming.\nFilming took place in January and February 1931, with a small budget of $151,000. During filming, Cagney also made \"Smart Money\", co-starring Edward G. Robinson, who had finished his breakthrough film \"Little Caesar\".\nIn the scene where Mike Powers punches his brother Tom, Wellman privately took Donald Cook aside and, explaining his desire for authenticity in Tom's reaction, asked the actor to really hit Cagney. Cook played his part a bit too well, and he struck Cagney in the mouth with such force, he actually broke one of Cagney's teeth. Yet in spite of his genuine shock and pain, Cagney stayed in character and played out the rest of the scene. In another incident, live ammunition was used in a scene where Tom Powers ducks around the corner of a building to take cover from machine gun fire; the use of live ammunition was common practice at the time. The bullets struck the wall of the building at the position where Cagney's head had been just a moment before.\nGrapefruit scene.\nIn a 1973 interview featured in the Turner Classic Movies documentary \"The Men Who Made The Movies: William Wellman\", Wellman said he added the grapefruit \"hitting\" to the scene, because when he and his wife at the time would get into fights, she would never talk or give any expression. Since she always had a grapefruit for breakfast, he always wanted to put the grapefruit into her face just to get a reaction out of her, so she would show some emotion; he felt that this scene gave him the opportunity to rid himself of that temptation.\nSome, such as film critic Ben Mankiewicz, have asserted that Mae Clarke's surprised and seemingly somewhat angry reaction to the grapefruit was genuine, as she had not been told to expect the unscripted action. However, in her autobiography, Clarke stated that Cagney had told her prior to that take what he planned to do. She said that her only genuine surprise came later, when she saw the grapefruit scene appear in the final film, as it had been her understanding that they were shooting it only as a joke to amuse the crew.\nAccording to Cagney, Clarke's ex-husband had the grapefruit scene timed, and would buy a ticket just before that scene went onscreen, go enjoy the scene, leave, then come back during the next show just in time to see only that scene again. The scene was parodied 30 years later in the 1961 Cagney movie \"One, Two, Three\" when Cagney threatens Otto (Horst Buchholz) with a half grapefruit but then decides against doing so.\nPrologue and epilogue.\nThe film featured a prologue \"apprising the audience that the hoodlums and terrorists of the underworld must be exposed and the glamour ripped from them\" and an epilogue \"pointing the moral that civilization is on her knees and inquiring loudly as to what is to be done.\" At the film's premiere in New York City, the film's prologue was preceded by a \"brief stage tableau, with sinuous green lighting, which shows a puppet gangster shooting another puppet gangster in the back.\"\nMusic.\nThe soundtrack included the following songs:\nThe music was performed by the Vitaphone Orchestra, led by conductor David Mendoza.\nReception.\nBox office.\nAccording to Warner Bros records the film earned $464,000 domestically and $93,000 internationally.\nCritical response.\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, of critics' reviews are positive.\nAndre Sennwald, who reviewed the film for \"The New York Times\" on its April 1931 release, called it \"just another gangster film at the Strand, weaker than most in its story, stronger than most in its acting, and, like most, maintaining a certain level of interest through the last burst of machine-gun fire\"; Woods and Cagney give \"remarkably lifelike portraits of young hoodlums\" and \"Beryl Mercer as Tom's mother, Robert Emmett O'Connor as a gang chief, and Donald Cook as Tom's brother, do splendidly.\"\n\"Time\" magazine called \"The Public Enemy\" \"well-told\" and noted, \"Unlike \"City Streets\", this is not a Hugoesque fable of gangsters fighting among themselves, but a documentary drama of the bandit standing against society. It carries to its ultimate absurdity the fashion for romanticizing gangsters, for even in defeat the public enemy is endowed with grandeur.\" \"Variety\" called it \"low-brow material given such workmanship as to make it high-brow\" which attempts to \"square everything [with] a foreword and postscript moralizing on the gangster as a menace to the public welfare.\"\nA theatre in Times Square ran \"The Public Enemy\" 24 hours a day during its initial release. At the 4th Academy Awards, the film was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Story, losing to \"The Dawn Patrol\".\nSubsequent recognition.\nIn 1989, an animatronics version of a scene from \"The Public Enemy\" was incorporated into The Great Movie Ride at the Disney-MGM Studios theme park in Orlando, Florida.\nIn 1998, \"The Public Enemy\" was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".\nIn 2001, the \"Sopranos\" episode \"Proshai, Livushka\" featured title character Tony Soprano watching scenes from the film, becoming overwhelmed with emotion.\nIn 2003 the character of Tom Powers was among the AFI's 100 Years...100 Heroes and Villains, placing 42nd in the villain list. In 2008, the film appeared on one of the AFI's 10 Top 10 lists\u2014the best ten films in ten \"classic\" American film genres. \"The Public Enemy\" was listed as the eighth best in the gangster film genre.\nIn 2025, \"The Hollywood Reporter\" listed \"The Public Enemy\" as having the best stunts of 1930 to 1931.\nRe-releases.\nThe film was re-released in 1941 after the Production Code was put into effect. Three scenes from the film were cut because of the Code. One is of a markedly effeminate tailor measuring Tom for a suit, another where Mamie serves Matt breakfast in bed, and the third showing Tom being raped by Paddy Ryan's girlfriend while hiding out in her apartment. These three scenes were later restored for all DVD and Blu-ray releases, and on Turner Classic Movies.\nThe film was also re-released in 1954, with a written prologue added before the opening credits, advising that gangsters such as Tom Powers and Caesar \"Rico\" Bandello, the title character in \"Little Caesar\" (played by Edward G. Robinson), are a menace that the public must confront.\nPreservation status.\nAs with many a Warner/First National pre-code talkie, a print has been in the Library of Congress since the 1970s. The film has been available to the public for several decades, due to several video and DVD releases.\nLegacy.\nIn the 90's and early 2000's wrestlers Rocco Rock and Johnny Grunge would used the title of the movie when they formed the tag team in places like WWE, WCW, and ECW and they would both be in the Hardcore Wrestling Hall of Fame.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It was adapted by Jack Kerouac from the third act of his play, \"Beat Generation\".\nPlot.\nBased on an incident in the life of Beat icon Neal Cassady and his wife, the painter Carolyn, the film tells the story of a railway brakeman whose wife invites a respected bishop over for dinner. However, the brakeman's bohemian friends crash the party, with comic results.\nProduction.\nOriginally intended to be called \"The Beat Generation\", the title \"Pull My Daisy\" was taken from the poem of the same name written by Kerouac, Ginsberg, and Cassady in the late 1940s. Part of the original poem was used as a lyric in Amram's jazz composition \"The Crazy Daisy\", sung by Anita Ellis, that opens the film.\nIn an interview with American Legends website, David Amram recalled of the chaotic production: \"It was at Jerry Newman\u2019s studio. I played the piano. Jack just sat down, saw the massacring of what he had written and did this phenomenal narration to make it look like what it was supposed to be. When you see \"Pull My Daisy\", close your eyes and just listen to Jack talking. That\u2019s the whole value of it right there. If Jack hadn\u2019t narrated it, it would have been just another home movie.\"\nIt was filmed in Alfred Leslie's loft at Fourth Ave. &amp; 12th St. in Manhattan.\nLeslie and Frank discuss the film at length in Jack Sargeant's book \"\". An illustrated transcript of the film's narration was also published in 1961 by Grove Press.\nRelease.\n\"Pull My Daisy\" premiered at the 1959 San Francisco International Film Festival. It was then released theatrically by Emile de Antonio in 1960.\nReception.\n\"The Hollywood Reporter\" wrote: \"This featurette has attracted considerable notice and comment because it was made by some charter members of the Beat Generation, including the movement's high priest and prophet, Jack Kerouac and its poet laureate, Allen Ginsberg. It has been hailed in some quarters as part of the Amerizan cinema's \"new wave. It isnn't that, but it is \u2013 or should be \u2013 interesting to Hollywood as an authentic statement of what the Beats are up to, provided by themselves.\u00a0... The title doesn't mean anything. There is no story in Kerouac's screenplay, which the novelist himself narrates. It is concerned mostly with some looney humor, often quite funny, as a trio of Beats, including Ginsberg, confront representatives of the regular \u2013 or square \u2013 world.\u00a0... Filmed in New York, the production is ragged technically, but never dull Anita Ellis sings a title song behind the main titles, which certainly shows the boys are willing to learn.\"\nThe \"New Statesman\" called the film \"poetic and funny.\"\nPreservation status.\n\"Pull My Daisy\" was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress in 1996, as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Marie served as regent of France between 1610 and 1617 during the minority of her son Louis XIII. Her mandate as regent legally expired in 1614, when her son reached the age of majority, but she refused to resign and continued as regent until she was removed by a coup in 1617.\nMarie was a member of the powerful House of Medici in the branch of the grand dukes of Tuscany. Her family's wealth inspired Henry IV to choose Marie as his second wife after his divorce from his previous wife, Margaret of Valois. The assassination of her husband in 1610, which occurred the day after her coronation, caused her to act as regent for her son, Louis XIII, until 1614, when he officially attained his legal majority, but as the head of the \"Conseil du Roi\", she retained the power.\nNoted for her ceaseless political intrigues at the French court, her extensive artistic patronage and her favourites (the most famous being Concino Concini and Leonora Dori), she ended up being banished from the country by her son and dying in the city of Cologne, in the Holy Roman Empire.\nLife.\nEarly years.\nBorn at the Palazzo Pitti of Florence, Italy on 26 April 1575, Maria was the sixth daughter of Francesco I de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany, and Archduchess Joanna of Austria. She was a descendant of Lorenzo the Elder \u2013a branch of the Medici family sometimes referred to as the 'cadet' branch\u2013 and was also a Habsburg through her mother, who was a direct descendant of Joanna of Castile and Philip I of Castile.\nOf her five elder sisters, only the eldest, Eleonora (born 28 February 1567) and the third, Anna (born 31 December 1569) survived infancy. Their only brother Philip de' Medici, was born on 20 May 1577. One year later (10 April 1578) Grand Duchess Joanna \u2013heavily pregnant with her eighth child\u2013 fell from the stairs in the Grand Ducal Palace in Florence, dying the next day after giving birth to a premature stillborn son. A few months later, Grand Duke Francesco I married his longtime mistress Bianca Cappello; the marriage was officially revealed one year later, on 12 June 1579. In a few years, Maria also lost two of her siblings, Philip (died 29 March 1582 aged 4) and Anna (died 19 February 1584 aged 14).\nMaria and her only surviving sister, Eleonora (with whom she had a close relationship) spent their childhood at the Palazzo Pitti in Florence, placed under the care of a governess along with their paternal first-cousin Virginio Orsini (son of Isabella de' Medici, Duchess of Bracciano).\nAfter her sister's marriage in 1584 with Vincenzo Gonzaga, heir of the Duchy of Mantua, and her departure to her husband's homeland, Maria's only playmate was her first cousin Virginio Orsini, to whom she deferred all her affection. In addition, her stepmother brought a female companion to the Palazzo Pitti for Maria, a young girl named Dianora Dori, who would be renamed Leonora. This young girl, a few years older than Maria, soon gained great influence over the princess, to the point that Maria would not make decisions without talking to Leonora first.\nOn the 19th and 20 October, in 1587, at the Villa Medici in Poggio a Caiano, Grand Duke Francesco I and Bianca Cappello died. They may have been poisoned, but some historians believe they were killed by malarial fever. Now orphaned, Maria was considered the richest heiress in Europe.\nMaria's uncle Ferdinando I de' Medici became the new Grand Duke of Tuscany and married Christina of Lorraine (granddaughter of the famous Catherine de' Medici, Queen of France) in 1589. Notwithstanding his desire to give an heir to his dynasty, the new Grand Duke gave his orphaned nephew and niece a good education. Maria was interested in science; she enjoyed learning about mathematics, philosophy, astronomy, as well as the arts. She was also passionate about jewelry and precious stones. Very devout, she was known to keep an open mind, and to depend on those around her for support.\nClose to the artists of her native Florence, Maria was trained in drawing by Jacopo Ligozzi, and she was reportedly very talented; she also played music (singing and practicing the guitar and the lute) and enjoyed theater, dance, and comedy.\nThe wealth of the Medici family attracted many suitors, in particular the younger brother of her aunt Grand Duchess Christina, Fran\u00e7ois, Count of Vaud\u00e9mont and heir of the Duchy of Lorraine. But soon, a more prestigious suitor presented himself: King Henry IV of France.\nQueen of France.\nThe marriage of Henry IV with Maria de' Medici represented above all, for France, a solution to dynastic and financial concerns: it was said that the French king \"owed the bride's father, Francesco de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany, who had helped support his war effort, a whopping 1,174,000 \u00e9cus and this was the only means Henry could find to pay back the debt...\" In addition, the Medici family\u2014banking creditors of the Kings of France\u2014promised a dowry of 600,000 \"\u00e9cus d'or\" (2 million livres including 1 million paid in cash to cancel the debt contracted by France with the Medici bank), which earned the future Queen the nickname \"the big banker\" (\"la grosse banqui\u00e8re\") from her jealous rival, Catherine Henriette de Balzac d'Entragues, Henry IV's current \"ma\u00eetresse-en-titre\". Moreover, Maria de' Medici was the granddaughter of Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor (in office: 1556\u20131564), thereby ensuring and reinforcing a legitimate royal descent for prospective future members of the House of Bourbon (the Catholic League and Habsburg Spain had questioned Bourbon legitimacy during the previous French Succession War of 1589 - c. 1593).\nAfter having obtained the annulment of his union to Margaret of Valois in December 1599, Henry IV officially started negotiations for his new marriage with Maria de' Medici. The marriage contract was signed in Paris in March 1600 and official ceremonies took place in Tuscany and France from October to December of the same year: the marriage by proxy took place at the Cathedral of Santa Maria del Fiore (now Florence Cathedral) on 5 October 1600 with Henry IV's favorite the Duc de Bellegarde representing the French sovereign. The celebrations were attended by 4,000 guests with lavish entertainment, including examples of the newly invented musical genre of opera, such as Jacopo Peri's \"Euridice\".Maria (now known by the French usage of her name, \"Marie de M\u00e9dicis\") left Florence for Livorno on 23 October, accompanied by 2,000 people who made up her suite, and set off for Marseille, which she reached on 3 November. Antoinette de Pons, Marquise de Guercheville and \"Premi\u00e8re dame d'honneur\" of the new Queen, was responsible for welcoming her to Marseille. After her disembarkation, Marie continued her trip, arriving at Lyon on 3 December. She and Henry IV finally met on 9 December and spent their wedding night together. On 17 December, the Papal legate finally arrived, and gave his blessing to the religious wedding ceremony at the Cathedral of Saint-Jean-Baptiste de Lyon.\nMarie gave birth to her first child, a son, on 27 September 1601 at the Palace of Fontainebleau. The boy, named Louis, and automatically upon birth heir to the throne and Dauphin of France, was born to the great satisfaction of the King and France, which had been waiting for the birth of a Dauphin for more than forty years. Marie gave birth to five more children (three daughters and two more sons) between 1602 and 1609; however, during 1603\u20131606 she was effectively separated from her husband.\nAlthough the marriage succeeded in producing children, it was not a happy one. Marie was of a very jealous temperament, and she refused to accept her husband's numerous infidelities; indeed, he forced his wife to rub shoulders with his mistresses. She mostly quarreled with the \"ma\u00eetresse-en-titre\" Catherine de Balzac d'Entragues (whom Henry IV had allegedly promised he would marry following the death in 1599 of his former \"ma\u00eetresse-en-titre\", Gabrielle d'Estr\u00e9es) in a language that shocked French courtiers; also, it was said in court that Henry IV took Marie only for breeding purposes exactly as Henry II had treated Catherine de' Medici. Although the King could have easily banished his mistress, supporting his wife, he never did so. Marie, in turn, showed great sympathy and support to her husband's banished ex-wife Marguerite de Valois, prompting Henry IV to allow her back to Paris.\nAnother bone of contention concerned the proper maintenance of Marie's household as Queen of France: despite the enormous dowry she brought to the marriage, her husband often refused her the money necessary to pay all the expenses that she intended to carry out to show everyone her royal rank. Household scenes took place, followed by periods of relative peace. Marie was also very keen to be officially crowned Queen of France, but Henry IV postponed the ceremony for political reasons.\nMarie had to wait until 13 May 1610 to be finally crowned Queen of France. At this time Henry IV was about to depart to fight in the War of Succession over the United Duchies of J\u00fclich-Cleves-Berg; the coronation aimed to confer greater legitimacy on the Queen from the perspective of a possible regency which she would be called upon to provide in the absence of the King. The very next day (14 May), Henry IV was assassinated by Fran\u00e7ois Ravaillac - which immediately raised suspicions of a conspiracy.\nRegency.\nWithin hours after Henry IV's assassination, Marie was confirmed as Regent by the Parliament of Paris on behalf of her son and new King, eight-year-old Louis XIII. She immediately banished her late husband's mistress, Catherine de Balzac d'Entragues, from the court. At first, she kept the closest advisers of Henry IV in the key court positions and took for herself (1611) the title of Governess of the Bastille, although she entrusted the physical custody of this important Parisian fortress to Joachim de Chateauvieux, her knight of honor, who took direct command as a lieutenant of the Queen-Regent.\nFrom the beginning, Marie was under suspicion at court because she was perceived as a foreigner and never truly mastered French; moreover, she was heavily influenced by her Italian friends and confidants, including her foster sister Leonora \"Galigai\" Dori and Concino Concini, who was created Marquis d'Ancre and a Marshal of France, even though he had never fought a single battle. The Concinis had Henry IV's able minister, the Duke of Sully, dismissed, and Italian representatives of the Roman Catholic Church hoped to force the suppression of Protestantism in France by means of their influence. However, Marie maintained her late husband's policy of religious tolerance. As one of her first acts, Marie reconfirmed Henri IV's Edict of Nantes, which ordered religious tolerance for Protestants in France while asserting the supremacy of the Roman Catholic Church.\nTo further consolidate her authority as Regent of the Kingdom of France, Marie decided to impose the strict protocol from the court of Spain. An avid ballet performer and art collector, she deployed artistic patronage that helped develop the arts in France. Daughter of a Habsburg archduchess, the Queen-Regent abandoned the traditional anti-Habsburg French foreign policy (one of her first acts was the overturn of the Treaty of Bruzolo, an alliance signed between Henry IV's representatives and Charles Emmanuel I, Duke of Savoy), and formed an alliance with Habsburg Spain which culminated in 1615 with the double marriage of her daughter Elisabeth and her son Louis XIII with the two children of King Philip III of Spain, Philip, Prince of Asturias (future Philip IV) and Anne of Austria, respectively.\nNevertheless, the Queen-Regent's policy caused discontent. On the one hand, Protestants were worried about the rapprochement of Marie with Spain; on the other hand, Marie's attempts to strengthen her power by relying on the Concinis deeply displeased part of the French nobility. Stirring up xenophobic passion, the nobility designated the Italian immigrants favored by Marie as responsible for all the wrongs of the kingdom. They are getting richer, they said, at our expense. Taking advantage of the clear weakness of the Regency, the \"princes of the blood\" under the leadership of Henri II, Prince of Cond\u00e9, rebelled against Marie.\nIn application of the Treaty of Sainte-Menehould (15 May 1614), the Queen-Regent convened the Estates General in Paris. The Prince of Cond\u00e9 failed to structure his opposition to royal power. However, Marie undertook to cement the alliance with Spain and to ensure respect for the theses of the Council of Trent. The reforms of the \"paulette\" and the \"taille\" remained a dead letter. The clergy played the role of arbiter between the Third Estate and the nobility who did not manage to get along: Civil lieutenant Henri de Mesmes declared that \"all the Estates were brothers and children of a common mother, France\", while one of the representatives of the nobility replied that he refused to be the brother of a child of a shoemaker or cobbler. This antagonism benefited the court, which soon pronounced the closure of the Estates General. The Regency was officially ended following the \"Lit de justice\" of 2 October 1614, which declared that Louis XIII had attained his legal majority of age, but Marie then became head of the \"Conseil du Roi\" and retained all her control over the government.\nOne year after the end of the Estates General, a new rebellion of the Prince of Cond\u00e9 allowed his entry into the \"Conseil du Roi\" by the Treaty of Loudun (3 May 1616), which also granted him the sum of 1,500,000 livres and the government of Guyenne. During this time, the Protestants obtained a reprieve of six years to the return of their places of safety to the royal power.\nIn 1616, the requirements of the Prince of Cond\u00e9 became so important that Marie had him arrested on 1 September and imprisoned him in the Bastille. The Duke of Nevers then took the leadership of the nobility in revolt against the Queen. Nevertheless, Marie's rule was strengthened by the appointment of Armand Jean du Plessis (later Cardinal Richelieu)\u2014who had come to prominence at the meetings of the Estates General\u2014as Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs on 5 November 1616.\nDespite being legally an adult for more than two years, Louis XIII had little power in the government; finally, he asserted his authority the next year. Feeling humiliated by the conduct of his mother, who monopolized power, the King organized (with the help of his favorite the Duc de Luynes) a coup d'\u00e9tat (also named \"Coup de majest\u00e9\") on 24 April 1617: Concino Concini was assassinated by the Marquis de Vitry, and Marie exiled to the Ch\u00e2teau de Blois.\nRevolt of 1619 and return from exile.\nIn the night of 21\u201322 February 1619, the 43-year-old Queen Mother escaped from her prison in Blois with a rope ladder and by scaling a wall of 40 m. Gentlemen took her across the Pont de Blois and riders sent by the Duc d'\u00c9pernon escorted Marie in his coach. She took refuge in the Ch\u00e2teau d'Angoul\u00eame and provoked an uprising against her son the King, the so-called \"war of mother and son\" (\"guerre de la m\u00e8re et du fils\").\nA first treaty, the Treaty of Angoul\u00eame, negotiated by Richelieu, calmed the conflict. However, the Queen Mother was not satisfied and relaunched the war by rallying the great nobles of the Kingdom to her cause (\"second war of mother and son\"). The noble coalition was quickly defeated at the Battle of Ponts-de-C\u00e9 (7 August 1620) by Louis XIII, who forgave his mother and the princes.\nAware that he could not avoid the formation of plots as long as his mother remained in exile, the King accepted her return to court. She then returned to Paris, where she worked on the construction of her Luxembourg Palace. After the death of the Duc de Luynes in December 1621, she gradually made her political comeback. Richelieu played an important role in her reconciliation with the king and even managed to bring the queen mother back to the \"Conseil du Roi\".\nArtistic patronage.\nFrom the time of her marriage to Henri IV, the Queen practiced ambitious artistic patronage, and placed under her protection several painters, sculptors and scholars. For her apartments at the Palace of Fontainebleau, the Flemish-born painter Ambroise Dubois was recruited to decorate Marie's \"cabinets\" with a series of paintings on the theme of the \"Ethiopics\" of Heliodorus, and painted for her gallery an important decoration on the theme of Diana and Apollo, mythological evocations of the royal couple. In the Louvre, the Queen had a luxurious apartment on the first floor fitted out, then moved in 1614 to a new apartment on the ground floor, which she had adorned with panels and paintings by Ambroise Dubois, Jacob Bunel, Guillaume Dum\u00e9e, and Gabriel Honnet on the theme of \"Jerusalem Delivered\" of Torquato Tasso (whose translation by Antoine de Nerv\u00e8ze was Marie's first reading in French). The Queen also patronized with portrait painters, such as Charles Martin and especially the Flemish Frans Pourbus the Younger.\nDuring and after the regency, Marie de M\u00e9dicis played a major role in the development of Parisian artistic life by focusing on the construction and furnishing of the Luxembourg Palace, which she referred to as her \"Palais M\u00e9dicis\". The site was purchased in 1612 and construction began in 1615, to designs of Salomon de Brosse. In particular, she tried to attract several large-scale artists to Paris: she brought in \"The Annunciation\" by Guido Reni, was offered a suite of \"Muses\" painted by Giovanni Baglione, invited the painter Orazio Gentileschi (who stayed in Paris during two years, during 1623\u20131625), and especially the Flemish painter Peter Paul Rubens, who was commissioned by her to create a 21-piece series glorifying her life and reign to be part of her art collection in the Luxembourg Palace. This series (composed between 1622 and 1625), along with three individual portraits made for Marie and her family, is now known as the \"Marie de' Medici cycle\" (currently displayed in the Louvre Museum); the cycle uses iconography throughout to depict Henry IV and Marie as Jupiter and Juno and the French state as a female warrior.\nThe Queen-Mother's attempts to convince Pietro da Cortona and Guercino to travel to Paris ended in failure, but during the 1620s the Luxembourg Palace became one of the most active decorative projects in Europe: sculptors such as Guillaume Berthelot and Christophe Cochet, painters like Jean Monier or the young Philippe de Champaigne, and even Simon Vouet on his return to Paris, participated in the decoration of the apartments of the Queen-Mother.\nA parchment Prayer Book belonging to Marie de' Medici has artwork that may date from the 15th century, but is also remarkable for its canivet cuttings. Pages are cut with intricate patterns that are made to look like lace of the period.\nConflict with Richelieu, exile and death.\nMarie continued to attend the \"Conseil du roi\" by following the advice of Cardinal Richelieu, who she introduced to the King as minister. Over the years, she did not notice the rising power of her prot\u00e9g\u00e9; when she realized it, she broke with the Cardinal and sought to oust him. Still not understanding the personality of her son and still believing that it would be easy for her to demand the disgrace of Richelieu from him, she tried to obtain the dismissal of the minister. After the \"Day of the Dupes\" (\"Journ\u00e9e des Dupes\") of 10\u201311 November 1630, Richelieu remained the principal minister, and the Queen Mother was constrained to be reconciled with him.\nMarie ultimately decided to withdraw from court. Louis XIII, judging his mother too involved in intrigue, encouraged her to retire to the Ch\u00e2teau de Compi\u00e8gne. From there, she fled on 19 July 1631 towards the city of \u00c9tr\u0153ungt (in the County of Hainaut), where she slept before going to Brussels. She intended to plead her case there, but the escape was only a political trap set by her son, who had withdrawn the regiments guarding the Ch\u00e2teau de Compi\u00e8gne. Now a refugee with the Spanish, enemies of France, Marie was thus deprived of her pensions.\nHer chaplain Mathieu de Morgues, who remained faithful to Marie in his exile, wrote pamphlets against Richelieu that circulated in France clandestinely. During her last years, Marie travelled to various European courts, in the Spanish Netherlands (the ruler of which, Isabella Clara Eugenia, and the ambassador Balthazar Gerbier tried to reconcile her with Richelieu), in England at the court of her daughter Queen Henrietta Maria for three years (staying en route to London in Gidea Hall) and then in Germany; with her daughters and sons-in-law where she tried again to form a \"league of sons-in-law\" against France, without ever being able to return, and her supporters were imprisoned, banished or condemned to death.\nHer visit to Amsterdam was considered a diplomatic triumph by the Dutch, as it lent official recognition to the newly-formed Dutch Republic; accordingly, she was given an elaborate ceremonial royal entry, of the sort the Republic avoided for its own rulers. Spectacular displays (by Claes Corneliszoon Moeyaert) and water pageants took place in the city's harbour in celebration of her visit. There was a procession led by two mounted trumpeters, and a large temporary structure was erected on an artificial island in the Amstel River especially for the festival. The structure was designed to display a series of dramatic tableaux in tribute to her once she set foot on the floating island and entered its pavilion. Afterwards she was offered an Indonesian rice table by the burgomaster, Albert Burgh. He also sold her a famous rosary, captured in Brazil. The visit prompted Caspar Barlaeus to write his \"Medicea hospes\" (\"The Medicean Guest\", 1638).\nMarie subsequently traveled to Cologne, where she took refuge in a house loaned by her friend, the painter Rubens. She fell ill in June 1642 and died of a bout of pleurisy in destitution on 3 July 1642, five months before Richelieu. It was not until 8 March 1643 that her body was finally laid to rest in France, in the Basilica of St Denis, The burial was held without much ceremony, and her heart was sent to La Fl\u00e8che, in accordance with the wish of Henry IV, who wanted their two hearts to be reunited. Her son Louis XIII died on 14 May, only two months after the funeral.\nIn 1793, during the French Revolution, Queen Marie was dug up by the French revolutionists who threw insults at the remains of the Queen whom they accused of having murdered her husband. Some among them tore out the remaining tufts of her hair still attached to the skull and passed them around. Some of her bones were found floating in muddy water and her remains were thrown into a mass grave along with other French deceased royals. In 1817, Louis XVIII ordered that those royals buried in the mass grave be reburied. Marie in 1817 was reburied in the crypt of Basilica of Saint Denis.\nPosthumous appraisal.\nHonor\u00e9 de Balzac, in his essay \"Sur Catherine de M\u00e9dicis\", encapsulated the Romantic generation's view of Marie de' Medici. She was born and raised in Italy and the French never really accepted her; hence, the negative reviews. However, Henry IV of France was not a rich man and needed Marie's money. The French were still not pleased with him choosing an Italian wife. &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Marie de' Medici, all of whose actions were prejudicial to France, has escaped the shame which ought to cover her name. Marie de' Medici wasted the wealth amassed by Henry IV; she never purged herself of the charge of having known of the king's assassination; her \"intimate\" was d'\u00c9pernon, who did not ward off Ravaillac's blow, and who was proved to have known the murderer personally for a long time. Marie's conduct was such that she forced her son to banish her from France, where she was encouraging her other son, Gaston.\nJules Michelet also contributed to the qualification of Marie de M\u00e9dicis.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The film stars James Dean, Natalie Wood, Sal Mineo, Jim Backus, Ann Doran, Corey Allen, William Hopper, and Nick Adams. It is also the film debut of Dennis Hopper, albeit in a minor role. It was filmed in the then recently introduced CinemaScope format. Focusing on emotionally confused suburban, middle-class teenagers, the film offers both social commentary and an alternative to previous films depicting delinquents in urban slum environments.\nThe film was an attempt to portray the moral decay of American youth, critique parental styles, and explore the differences and conflicts between generations, namely the Interbellum Generation and the Silent Generation. The title was adopted from psychologist Robert M. Lindner's 1944 book, \"Rebel Without a Cause: The Hypnoanalysis of a Criminal Psychopath\", although the film itself does not make any other references to Lindner's book. Warner Bros. released the film on October 27, 1955, nearly a month after Dean's death in a car crash on September 30, 1955.\nOver the years, the film has achieved landmark status for the performance of Dean, fresh from his Oscar-nominated role in \"East of Eden\", in his most celebrated role. This was the only film of Dean's in which he received top billing. In 1990, \"Rebel Without a Cause\" was added to the Library of Congress's National Film Registry as being deemed \"culturally, historically, and aesthetically significant\".\nPlot.\nIn Los Angeles during the mid-1950s, teenager Jim Stark is arrested and taken to the juvenile division of a police station for public intoxication. At the station he crosses paths with John \"Plato\" Crawford, who was brought in for killing a litter of puppies, and Judy, who was brought in for curfew violation. The three separately reveal their innermost frustrations to the officers; all three of them suffer from problems at home. Jim feels anguished by his constantly bickering parents, Frank and Carol, but even more so by his timid father's failure to stand up to Carol; the issues are further complicated by Frank's interfering mother. His frustrations are made manifest to officer Ray Fremick when Jim is released to their custody.\nJudy is convinced that her father ignores her because she is no longer a little girl, so she dresses up in racy clothes to get attention, which only causes her father to call her a \"dirty tramp\", while Plato's father abandoned his family when he was a toddler, and his mother is often away from home, leaving Plato in the care of his housekeeper.\nOn the way to his first day at Dawson High, Jim again meets Judy and offers her a ride. Seemingly unimpressed by Jim, she declines and is instead picked up by her \"friends\", a gang of delinquents led by Buzz Gunderson who Judy is also dating. Jim is shunned by the rest of the student body but is befriended by Plato, who comes to idolize Jim.\nAfter a field trip to Griffith Observatory, Buzz provokes and challenges Jim to a knife fight; Jim bests Buzz by knocking his switchblade out of his hand, then throws his own blade away. To preserve his status as gang leader, Buzz suggests stealing some cars to have a \"Chickie Run\" at a seaside cliff. At home, Jim ambiguously asks his father about defending one's honor in a dangerous situation, but Frank advises him against confrontation of any kind. That night, during the chickie run, Buzz plunges to his death when the strap on his jacket sleeve becomes entangled with his door-latch lever, preventing him from exiting the car. As police approach, the gang flees, leaving Judy behind, but Jim persuades her to leave with him and Plato.\nJim later confides to his parents his involvement in the crash and considers turning himself in. When Carol declares they are moving again, Jim pleads with Frank to stand up for him. When Frank refuses, Jim attacks him in frustration, then storms off to the police station to confess, only to be turned away by the desk sergeant. Jim drives back home, finding Judy waiting for him. She apologizes for her prior treatment of him due to peer pressure, and the two begin to fall in love. Agreeing to never return to their respective homes, Jim suggests they visit an old deserted mansion Plato told him about.\nMeanwhile, Plato is intercepted by three members of Buzz's gang, who are convinced that Jim betrayed them to the police. They steal Plato's address book and pursue Jim; Plato retrieves his mother's gun and leaves to warn Jim and Judy, finding them at the mansion. The three new friends act out a fantasy as a family. Plato then falls asleep, and Jim and Judy leave to explore the mansion, where they share their first kiss. Buzz's gang find and wake up Plato, who, frightened and distraught, shoots and wounds one of the gang. When Jim returns, he attempts to restrain Plato, who flees, accusing Jim of abandoning him.\nPlato runs to the observatory and barricades himself inside as more police converge including Fremick who, along with Frank and Carol, has been searching for Jim. Jim and Judy follow Plato into the observatory, where Jim persuades Plato to trade the gun for his red jacket; Jim quietly removes the ammunition before returning it, and then convinces Plato to come outside. When the police notice that Plato still has the gun, they shoot Plato dead as he charges them, unaware that Jim had removed the bullets. Frank comforts his grieving son, vowing to be a better father. Now reconciled with his parents, Jim introduces them to Judy.\nCast.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;* James Dean as James \"Jim\" Stark\nProduction.\nBackground.\nWarner Brothers had bought the rights to Lindner's book, intending to use the title for a film. Attempts to create a film version in the late 1940s eventually ended without a film or even a full script being produced. When Marlon Brando did a five-minute screen test for the studio in 1947, he was given fragments of one of the partial scripts. However, Brando was not auditioning for \"Rebel Without a Cause\", and there was no offer of any part made by the studio. The film, as it later appeared, was the result of a totally new script written in the 1950s that had nothing to do with the Brando test. The screen test is included on a 2006 special edition DVD of the 1951 film \"A Streetcar Named Desire\".\nIrving Shulman, who adapted Nicholas Ray's initial film story into the screenplay, had considered changing the name of James Dean's character to Herman Deville, according to Jurgen Muller's \"Movies of the '50s\". He originally had written a number of scenes that were shot and later cut from the final version of the film. According to an AFI interview with Stewart Stern, with whom Shulman worked on the screenplay, one of the scenes was thought to be too emotionally provocative to be included in the final print of the film. It portrayed the character of Jim Stark inebriated to the point of belligerence screaming at a car in the parking lot \"It's a little jeep jeep! Little jeep, jeep!\" The scene was considered unproductive to the story's progression by head editor William H. Ziegler and ultimately was cut. In 2006, members of the Film Society of Lincoln Center petitioned to have the scene printed and archived for historical preservation.\nNicholas Ray conducted extensive research months before filming commenced, including weeks spent travelling the country with screenwriter Stewart Stern in which they interviewed hundreds of police officers, judges, youth leaders, juvenile authorities, and welfare agency managers to gather material for the film. Ray stated his intention for the film was to \"do a movie about the kids next door\" as opposed to delinquent-themed films of the time set in a \"slum condition\", adding that \"Rebel\" was to be about \"middle-class kids, kids like my own, not kids from the wrong side of the tracks.\"\nCasting.\nNicholas Ray had considered Debbie Reynolds, Margaret O'Brien, Kathryn Grant and Pat Crowley for the role of Judy, before selecting Natalie Wood. According to a biography of Natalie Wood, she almost did not get the role because Nicholas Ray thought that she did not fit the role of the wild teen character. While on a night out with friends, she was in a car accident. Upon hearing this, Ray rushed to the hospital. While in delirium, Wood overheard the doctor murmuring and calling her a \"goddamn juvenile delinquent\"; she soon yelled to Ray, \"Did you hear what he called me, Nick?! He called me a goddamn juvenile delinquent! \"Now\" do I get the part?!\"\nSal Mineo would later note in a 1972 interview that the character of Plato Crawford was intended to have been gay. Speaking to Boze Hadleigh, he said, \"[It m]akes sense [that Plato was killed off]: he was, in a way, the first gay teenager in films. You watch it now, you \"know\" he had the hots for James Dean. You watch it now, and everyone knows about Jimmy['s bisexuality], so it's like he had the hots for Natalie [Wood] and me. Ergo, I had to be bumped off, out of the way.\"\nFilming.\nThe film was in production from March 28 to May 26, 1955. When production began, Warner Bros. considered it a B-movie project, and Ray used black-and-white film stock. When Jack L. Warner realized James Dean was a rising star and a hot property, filming was switched to color stock, and many scenes had to be reshot in color. It was shot in the widescreen CinemaScope format, which had been introduced two years previously. With its densely expressive images, the film has been called a \"landmark ... a quantum leap forward in the artistic and technical evolution of a format.\"\nExterior scenes at the abandoned mansion to which the characters retreat were filmed at the William O. Jenkins House, previously used in the film \"Sunset Boulevard\" (1950). It was demolished just two years after filming.\nDawson High School, the school in the film, was actually Santa Monica High School, located in Santa Monica, California.\nReception.\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, of 85 critics' reviews are positive. The website's consensus reads: \"\"Rebel Without a Cause\" is a searing melodrama featuring keen insight into '50s juvenile attitude and James Dean's cool, iconic performance.\" Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the a score of 89 out of 100, based on 19 critics, indicating .\nNatalie Wood, Sal Mineo, and Nicholas Ray were nominated for Academy Awards for their roles in \"Rebel Without a Cause\", which grossed $7,197,000 (equivalent to $\u00a0million in 2024) in domestic and overseas screenings, making it Warner Bros.' second-biggest box-office draw that year. James Dean was also nominated posthumously, albeit for his other 1955 film, \"East of Eden\". (Academy rules prevent an actor from potentially being nominated for more than one film per category.)\nThe movie opened to mixed reviews when it was released on October 27, 1955, less than a month after Dean, whose performance was praised all around by film critics, died on September 30. William Zinsser wrote a scathing review of \"Rebel\" in his \"New York Herald Tribune\" column, concluding his summary of the film's plot with the words, \"All this takes two hours, but it seems more like two days. The movie is written and acted so ineptly, directed so sluggishly, that all names but one will be omitted here. The exception is Dean, the gifted young actor who was killed last month. His rare talent and appealing personality even shine through this turgid melodrama.\"\nBosley Crowther, writing in \"The New York Times\", described \"Rebel Without a Cause\" as \"violent, brutal and disturbing\", and as an excessively graphic depiction of teenagers and their \"weird ways\". He referred to a \"horrifying duel with switchblades\", a \"brutal scene\", and a \"shocking presentation\" of a race in stolen automobiles. Although he admitted that there are moments of accuracy and truth in the film, he found these \"excruciating\", and discerned a \"pictorial slickness\" in the production's use of the CinemaScope process and its filming in the widescreen format, a slickness he declared was at odds with the realism of Ray's directing. Crowther was not impressed by James Dean's acting, and cited the various mannerisms he believed Dean copied from Marlon Brando, asserting that \"Never have we seen a performer so clearly follow another's style\" and calling Dean's interpretation of the Jim Stark role a \"clumsy display\".\nReviewer Jack Moffitt of \"The Hollywood Reporter\", who correctly thought the film would be a money maker, wrote a less critical, more laudatory review. He found the acting of James Dean, Natalie Wood, and Sal Mineo to be \"extraordinarily good\", and the direction by Nicholas Ray to be \"outstanding\". He praised the realistic manner in which Ray depicted the police station scenes and the engaging manner, according to Moffitt, in which he captured the nihilism of the teenage subculture for his audience. Moffitt took issue with the underlying ideology of the film, especially its implication, as he saw it, that professional bureaucrats could better guide youth than the American family unit itself. He criticized the film for overgeneralizing, calling this aspect a \"convenient cliche\", and summed up his review by describing the film as \"a superficial treatment of a vital problem that has been staged brilliantly\".\nRobert J. Landry, managing editor of \"Variety\" magazine at the time, wrote a review published on October 26. He described \"Rebel\" as a \"fairly exciting, suspenseful and provocative, if also occasionally far-fetched, melodrama of unhappy youth on another delinquency kick.\" Unlike some movie critics, Landry thought that James Dean, under the influence of Nicholas Ray's direction, had mostly freed his acting of the mannerisms characteristic of Marlon Brando's style, and that his performance in the movie was \"very effective\". He praised Dean's interpretation of a maladjusted teenager, noting his ability \"to get inside the skin\" of his character as \"not often encountered\".\nWanda Hale of the \"New York Daily News\" found fault with \"Rebel\"'s depiction, in her view, of its adults as cardboard figures and of its middle-class teenagers as hoodlums, arguing that it lacked credibility and that \"[a]s an honest purposeful drama of juvenile hardness and violence the film just doesn't measure up.\" On the other hand, she praised James Dean's acting, writing, \"[w]ith complete control of the character, he gives a fine, sensitive performance of an unhappy, lonely teenager, tormented by the knowledge of his emotional instability.\"\nAccolades.\nAmerican Film Institute recognition\n\"Empire\" magazine recognition\nControversies.\nCensorship.\n\"Rebel\" was censored in Britain by the British Board of Film Censors and released with scenes cut and an X-rating. Most of the knife fight was excised and not shown on British screens until 1967. The film was banned in New Zealand in 1955 by Chief Censor Gordon Mirams, out of fears that it would incite \"teenage delinquency\", only to be released on appeal the following year with scenes cut and an R16 rating. \"Rebel\" was also banned in Spain, where it had to be smuggled into the country for private screenings, and was not officially released there until 1964.\nEven before its release, \"Rebel\" faced potential issues with censorship due to its violent scenes. James Dean, after he completed filming, commented on the possible censorship of \"Rebel\", saying that the censors would be \"doing the country an injustice,\" and stated that: \"Since juvenile delinquency is based on violence, it is justified violence. We picture a very real situation that exists in this country\u2014something that should be stamped out. Movies like \"The Blackboard Jungle\" and \"Rebel\" can help.\"\nLegacy.\n\"Rebel Without a Cause\" is closely tied with the rise in youth culture during the mid-1950s, in which teenagers became seen as \"a distinct social group\". The box office successes of \"Rebel\" and \"Blackboard Jungle\" in 1955 caused a \"chain reaction\" in Hollywood, according to Army Archerd, who wrote that every Hollywood studio after was \"making films on the same subject, with varying degrees of violence, humor, or rock 'n' roll music.\"\nThe switchblade James Dean's character used in the fight scene at Griffith Observatory was offered at auction on September 30, 2015, by Profiles in History with an estimated value of US$12,000 to $15,000; the winning bid was US$12,000. Also offered at the same auction were production photographs and a final shooting script dated August 17, 1955 for a behind-the-scenes television promotional film titled \"Behind the Cameras: Rebel Without a Cause\" hosted by Gig Young and that had scripted interviews and staged footage by the cast and crew (script winning bid US$225.)

It is native to much of Mexico, Bermuda, the Bahamas, Central America, South America (as far south as northern Patagonia), the Southern United States, and West Indies. It has been naturalized in Queensland (Australia). It is colloquially known as \"old man's beard\" in several places, and known as \"grandpa's beard\" in French Polynesia. It has the widest distribution of any bromeliad.\nMost known in the United States, it commonly is found on the southern live oak (\"Quercus virginiana\") and bald cypress (\"Taxodium distichum\") in the lowlands, swamps, and marshes of the mid-Atlantic and Southeastern states, from the coast of southeastern Virginia to Florida and west to southern Arkansas and Texas. While it superficially resembles its namesake, the lichen \"Usnea\", it is neither a lichen nor a moss (instead being a member of the bromeliad family, Bromeliaceae), and it is not native to Spain.\nDescription.\nSpanish moss consists of one or more slender stems, bearing alternate thin, curved or curly, and heavily scaled leaves long and broad, that grow vegetatively in a chain-like fashion (pendant), forming hanging structures of up to . The gray-green garlands have occasionally been found hanging down as much as .\nThe plant has no roots. Its flowers are yellow-green and small, with spreading petals. The scape is partly hidden within the leaf sheath. Spanish moss propagates both by seed and vegetatively by fragments that are carried on the wind and stick to tree limbs or that are carried to other locations by birds as nesting material.\nTaxonomy.\nSpanish moss is in the family Bromeliaceae (the bromeliads). Formerly, it was placed in the genera \"Anoplophytum\", \"Caraguata\", and \"Renealmia\". The specific name of the plant, \"usneoides\", means \"resembling \"Usnea\"\", a lichen.\nHabitat and distribution.\nSpanish moss' primary range is in the Southeastern United States (including Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands) to Argentina, where the climate is warm enough and a relatively high average humidity occurs. In North America, it occurs in a broad band following the Gulf of Mexico and the southern Atlantic coast. The northern limit of its natural range is Northampton County, Virginia, with colonial-era reports of it in southern Maryland, where no populations are now known to exist.\nIt has been introduced to locations around the world with similar conditions, including Hawaii, where it first established itself in the nineteenth century.\nEcology.\nSpanish moss is not parasitic: it is an epiphyte that absorbs nutrients and water through its own leaves from the air and rain falling upon it. While its presence rarely kills the trees on which it grows, it occasionally becomes so thick that, by shading the leaves of the tree, it slows the growth rate of the tree. Different species of plant seem to vary in their tolerance to Spanish moss, and it has become a problematic weed in some places it has been introduced, such as Northern Sydney, Australia, where it is a threat to the Sydney Turpentine Ironbark Forest, Blue Gum High Forest and rainforests of the area.\nSpanish moss can use the water-conserving strategy of crassulacean acid metabolism for photosynthesis.\nIn the southern U.S., the plant seems to show preferences for southern live oak (\"Quercus virginiana\") and bald cypress (\"Taxodium distichum\") because of their high rates of foliar mineral leaching (calcium, magnesium, potassium, and phosphorus) that provides an abundant supply of nutrients to the epiphytic plant. It can also colonize other tree species such as sweetgum (\"Liquidambar styraciflua\"), crepe-myrtles (\"Lagerstroemia\" spp.), other oaks, and even pines. It also grows more uncommonly on artificial structures such as fencing and telephone lines.\nSpanish moss shelters a number of creatures, including rat snakes and three species of bats. One species of jumping spider, \"Pelegrina tillandsiae\", has been found only on Spanish moss. Although widely presumed to infest Spanish moss, in one study of the ecology of the plant, chiggers were not present among thousands of other arthropods identified on the plant.\nSpanish moss is sensitive to airborne contaminants. It does not grow in areas where smoke is common, such as near chimneys. It has receded from urban areas due to increasing air pollution.\nCulture and folklore.\nSpanish moss is often associated with Southern Gothic imagery and Deep South culture, due to its propensity for growing in subtropical humid southern locales such as Alabama, Southern Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, east and south Texas, and extreme south eastern Virginia.\nOne anecdote about the origin of Spanish moss is called \"the Meanest Man Who Ever Lived\", in which the man's white hair grew very long and got caught on trees.\nSpanish moss was introduced to Hawaii in the nineteenth century. It became a popular ornamental and lei plant. In Hawaii, it was named \"\u02bbumi\u02bbumi-o-Dole\" after the beard of Sanford B. Dole, the first president of the Provisional Government of Hawaii. It is also known as hinahina, (\"silvery\") borrowing the name of the native heliotrope used in lei until shoreline development made access difficult. It has become a substitute for the native hinahina in lei used for pageantry. In the early 21st century the plant was heavily marketed as \"Pele's hair\"/\"lauoho-o-Pele\", which actually refers to a type of filamentous volcanic glass.\nHuman uses.\nSpanish moss has been used for various purposes, including building insulation, mulch, packing material, mattress stuffing, and fiber. In the early 1900s it was used commercially in the padding of car seats. More than 10,000 tons of processed Spanish moss was produced in 1939. Today, it is collected in smaller quantities for use in arts and crafts, as bedding for flower gardens, and as an ingredient in bousillage, a traditional wall covering material. In some parts of Latin America and Louisiana, it is used in nativity scenes.\nIn the desert regions of southwestern United States, dried Spanish moss is sometimes used in the manufacture of evaporative coolers, colloquially known as \"swamp coolers\" (and in some areas as \"desert coolers\"), which are used to cool homes and offices much less expensively than air conditioners. The cooling technology uses a pump that squirts water onto a pad made of Spanish moss plants; a fan then pulls air through the pad, and into the building. Evaporation of the water on the pads serves to reduce air temperature, cooling the building.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

In 1815 at Clifton, Bristol, Mary married Wyndham Lewis, MP (1780\u20131838), a colleague of Benjamin Disraeli. In August 1839, the year following Lewis's death, she married Disraeli at St George's, Hanover Square, in London. Her fortune allowed him to purchase the estate of Hughenden in Buckinghamshire and to live in the style of an English gentleman.\nIn recognition of Disraeli's services to the nation, Queen Victoria desired to ennoble him at the end of his first ministry. However, as he wished to remain in the House of Commons, his wife accepted the title in his place and was created Viscountess Beaconsfield, of Beaconsfield in the County of Buckingham, on 30 November 1868. (After Mary's death, Disraeli accepted the title of Earl of Beaconsfield.)\nStaid Victorians were often scandalised by Mary's uninhibited conversation but soon learned not to insult her within Disraeli's hearing. Even Queen Victoria herself was said to be amused when Mary Anne commented, in response to a remark about some lady's pale complexion, \"I wish you could see my Dizzy in his bath!\" Once, at a house party where Lord Hardinge, a great soldier of the day, was in the room next to the Disraelis, Mary Anne announced at breakfast that she had slept the night before between the greatest soldier (Hardinge) and the greatest orator (Disraeli) of their times: Lady Hardinge was definitely not amused.\nDisraeli had been unimpressed by Mary Lewis when he first met her, but he came to understand that she was shrewder than her outward manner had led him to believe. She was a great help to him in editing the books he wrote, and spent 30 years taking care of him. She once joked in public that although he had married her for her money he would do it again for love. In later life she became increasingly eccentric, both in conversation and appearance, but her husband's devotion and loyalty to her never faltered. She was some twelve years older than her husband but their romance continued until the day she died.\nIn the spring of 1872, Mary became seriously ill, and by May it was clear that she was dying of stomach cancer. She rallied sufficiently to take a summer tour through the Home Counties with her husband. In November she felt well enough to hold a small dinner party for their close friends; but her condition deteriorated and she died on 15 December, at the age of eighty.\n\"There was no care which she could not mitigate, and no difficulty which she could not face. She was the most cheerful and courageous woman I ever knew\" her husband wrote after her death. His great adversary William Gladstone, who had liked Mary, wrote him a letter of condolence. Disraeli, touched by this sympathy from a man who disliked him, replied that \"Marriage is the greatest earthly happiness when founded on mutual sympathy.\"\nShe is buried with Disraeli in a vault in the Church of St Michael and All Angels Church, Hughenden, in Hughenden, Buckinghamshire, close to the Disraeli family home, Hughenden Manor. The house is now in the care of the National Trust, and has been preserved in the state when it was occupied by the Disraelis. It is open to the public as a visitor attraction.\nCultural depictions.\nGeorge Arliss became renowned for his portrayal of the man in the 1911 play, \"Disraeli\" (which Arliss commissioned), in its 1917 revival, and in the 1921 and 1929 film adaptations. In the latter three productions, Arliss' wife, Florence Arliss, appeared in the role of Mary.\nIn \"The Prime Minister,\" a 1941 British historical film starring John Gielgud as Disraeli, Mary was portrayed by Diana Wynyard.\nIn \"The Invincible Mr Disraeli,\" (1963) she was portrayed by Greer Garson. Trevor Howard acted the part of her husband.\nIn the four-part 1978 ATV miniseries \"\", written by David Butler, she was portrayed by Mary Peach, opposite Ian McShane as Disraeli. The miniseries was presented in the U.S. on PBS's Masterpiece Theatre in 1980 and was nominated for the Emmy Award for Outstanding Limited Series.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He was nicknamed \"the Raphael of flowers\" and has been called the greatest botanical illustrator of all time.\nRedout\u00e9 was an official court artist of Marie Antoinette, and continued painting through the French Revolution and Reign of Terror. He survived the turbulent political upheaval to gain international recognition for his precise renderings of plants, which remain as fresh in the early 21st century as when first painted. He combined great artistic skills with a pleasing and ingratiating personality which assisted him with his influential patrons. After Queen Marie-Antoinette, his patrons included both of Napoleon's wives \u2013 Empress Jos\u00e9phine and Marie Louise, Duchess of Parma \u2013 as well as Maria Amalia of Naples and Sicily, wife of Louis Philippe I, the last king of France.\nRedout\u00e9 collaborated with the greatest botanists of his day and participated in nearly fifty publications depicting both the familiar flowers of the French court and plants from places as distant as Japan, America, South Africa, and Australia. He worked from live plants rather than herbarium specimens, which contributed to his fresh subtle renderings. He was painting during a period in botanical illustration (1798 \u2013 1837) that is noted for the publication of outstanding folio editions with coloured plates. Redout\u00e9 produced over published plates depicting over different species, many never rendered before. Of the French botanical illustrators employed in the French capital, Redout\u00e9 is the one who remains in the public consciousness today. He is seen as an important heir to the tradition of the Flemish and Dutch flower painters Brueghel, Ruysch, van Huysum and de Heem.\nEarly life.\nRedout\u00e9 was born 10 July 1759, in Saint-Hubert, in the Belgian Luxembourg. Both his father and grandfather were painters, and his elder brother, Antoine Ferdinand, was an interior decorator and scenery designer. He never had much in the way of formal education, instead leaving home at the age of 13 to earn his living as an itinerant painter, doing interior decoration, portraits, and religious commissions. Eventually, in 1782, he made his way to Paris to join his brother in painting scenery for theatres.\nPainting career.\nIn Paris, Redout\u00e9 met the botanists Charles Louis L'H\u00e9ritier de Brutelle and Ren\u00e9 Desfontaines, who steered him towards botanical illustration, a rapidly growing discipline. L'H\u00e9ritier became his instructor, teaching him to dissect flowers and portray their specific characteristics with precision. L'Heritier also introduced Redout\u00e9 to members of the court at Versailles, following which Marie Antoinette became his patron. Redout\u00e9 eventually received the title of Draughtsman and Painter to the Queen's Cabinet.\nCheveau, a Parisian dealer, brought the young artist to the attention of the botanical artist Gerard van Spaendonck at the Jardin du Roi, which became the Jardin des plantes of the National Museum of Natural History, France in 1793, after the Revolution. Van Spaendonck became another of Redout\u00e9's teachers, especially influencing his handling of watercolour.\nIn 1786, Redout\u00e9 began to work at the National Museum of Natural History cataloguing the collections of flora and fauna and participating in botanical expeditions. In 1787, he left France to study plants at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew near London, returning the following year. In 1792 he was employed by the French Academy of Sciences. In 1798, Empress Jos\u00e9phine de Beauharnais, the first wife of Napoleon Bonaparte, became his patron and, some years later, he became her official artist. In 1809, Redout\u00e9 taught painting to Princess Ad\u00e9la\u00efde of Orl\u00e9ans.\nRedout\u00e9 was engaged to paint selected plants from the garden at the Ch\u00e2teau de Malmaison, Paris. Whilst he was well known for the painting \"Les Roses\", \"Jardin de la Malmaison\" has a distinctly Australian connection, as 46 of the 120 plates featured Australian plants, and the majority of these are endemic to Queensland. One of the first Australian plants Empress Jos\u00e9phine chose for Redout\u00e9 to illustrate was a common Queensland flowering vine, \"Hardenbergia violacea\" (false sarsaparilla), a vine seen in abundance in the Queensland bush. Other Queensland plants illustrated include the \"Pandorea pandorana\" (wonga wonga vine), \"Melaleuca styphelioides\" (prickly-leaved paperbark), and \"Hibiscus heterophyllus\" (native rosella).\nLater career and legacy.\nAfter Empress Jos\u00e9phine's death (1814), Redout\u00e9 had some difficult years until he was appointed a master of draughtsmanship for the National Museum of Natural History in 1822. In 1824, he gave some drawing classes at the museum. Many of his pupils were aristocrats or royalty. He became a Chevalier of the Legion of Honour in 1825. Although particularly renowned for his botanical exploration of roses and lilies, he thereafter produced paintings purely for aesthetic value.\nRedout\u00e9 taught and painted up to the day he died of a stroke on 19 or 20 June 1840. He was survived by his wife, Marie-Marte Gobert, whom he married in 1786, and their two daughters. He was interred in P\u00e8re Lachaise Cemetery. A Brussels school bears his name: the Institut Redout\u00e9-Peiffer in Anderlecht.\nMost of the \"Les Liliac\u00e9es\" watercolours went from the Empress Jos\u00e9phine to her son from her first marriage Eug\u00e8ne de Beauharnais. Most of the watercolours of her \"Jardin de la Malmaison\" (gardens of Ch\u00e2teau de Malmaison) were acquired by the Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge.\nRedout\u00e9's paintings for \"Les Roses\" were bought by Charles X of France for his widowed daughter-in-law, Marie-Caroline of Bourbon-Two Sicilies, Duchess of Berry. Their whereabouts are virtually untraceable: in 1948 some were sold by Sotheby's in London and a few were acquired by the Hunt Institute for Botanical Documentation; later, single sheets have appeared repeatedly in auction.\nIn 1985, 468 leaves were bought at a New York auction by an art dealer for approximately $5.5 million and then dispersed.\nIn the 20th and 21st century, numerous exhibitions in Europe, the Americas, and Australia have been devoted to the work of Redout\u00e9. The Biodiversity Heritage Library, the Library of Congress and other libraries have made many of his works accessible online and reproductions of his prints are available from virtually all print and poster shops.\nPrincipal works.\nPosthumously published, in 1989:\nPaintings.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Botanist/styles.css\"/&gt;The standard author abbreviation Redout\u00e9 is used to indicate this person as the author when citing a botanical name.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "76065", "revid": "50535372", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=76065", "title": "The Faerie Queene", "text": "English epic poem by Edmund Spenser\nThe Faerie Queene is an English epic poem by Edmund Spenser. Books I\u2013III were first published in 1590, then republished in 1596 together with books IV\u2013VI. \"The Faerie Queene\" is notable for its form: at over 36,000 lines and over 4,000 stanzas, it is one of the longest poems in the English language; it is also the work in which Spenser invented the verse form known as the Spenserian stanza. On a literal level, the poem follows several knights as a means to examine different virtues. The poem is also an allegorical work. As such, it can be read on several levels, including as praise (or, later, criticism) of Queen Elizabeth I. In Spenser's \"Letter of the Authors\", he states that the entire epic poem is \"cloudily enwrapped in Allegorical devices\", and that the aim of publishing \"The Faerie Queene\" was to \"fashion a gentleman or noble person in virtuous and gentle discipline\".\nSpenser presented the first three books of \"The Faerie Queene\" to Elizabeth I in 1589, probably sponsored by Walter Raleigh. The poem was a clear effort to gain court favour, and as a reward Elizabeth granted Spenser a pension for life amounting to \u00a350 a year, though there is no further evidence that Elizabeth ever read any of the poem. This royal patronage elevated the poem to a level of success that made it Spenser's defining work.\nSummary.\nBook I is centred on the virtue of Holiness as embodied in the Redcrosse Knight. Largely self-contained, Book I can be understood to be its own miniature epic. At first, the Redcrosse Knight and his lady Una travel together when he defeats the monster Errour. Then they travel separately after the wizard Archimago, using a false dream, tricks the Redcrosse Knight into thinking that Una is unchaste. The Redcrosse Knight meets Duessa, who feigns distress in order to entrap him. Duessa leads the Redcrosse Knight to captivity by the giant Orgoglio. Meanwhile, Una seeks tirelessly to be reunited with the Redcrosse Knight.\nShe overcomes many perils, meets Arthur, and finally rescues the Redcrosse Knight from his capture, from Duessa, and from Despair. Una and Arthur help the Redcrosse Knight recover in the House of Holiness, with the House's ruler Caelia and her three daughters joining them. There, the Redcrosse Knight sees a vision of his future. He then returns Una to her parents' castle and rescues them from a dragon, and the two are betrothed after resisting Archimago one last time.\nBook II is centred on the virtue of Temperance as embodied in Sir Guyon, who is tempted by the fleeing Archimago into nearly attacking the Redcrosse Knight. Guyon discovers a woman killing herself out of grief for having her lover tempted and bewitched by the witch Acrasia and killed. Guyon swears a vow to avenge them and protect their child. Guyon on his quest starts and stops fighting several evil, rash, or tricked knights and meets Arthur. Finally, they come to Acrasia's Island and the Bower of Bliss, where Guyon resists temptations to violence, idleness, and lust. Guyon captures Acrasia in a net, destroys the Bower, and rescues those imprisoned there.\nBook III is centred on the virtue of Chastity as embodied in Britomart, a lady knight. Resting after the events of Book II, Guyon and Arthur meet Britomart, who wins a joust with Guyon. They separate as Arthur and Guyon leave to rescue Florimell, while Britomart rescues the Redcrosse Knight. Britomart reveals to the Redcrosse Knight that she is pursuing Sir Artegall because she is destined to marry him. The Redcrosse Knight defends Artegall and they meet Merlin, who explains more carefully Britomart's destiny to found the English monarchy. Britomart leaves and fights Sir Marinell. Arthur looks for Florimell, joined later by Sir Satyrane and Britomart, and they witness and resist sexual temptation. Britomart separates from them and meets Sir Scudamore, looking for his captured lady Amoret. Britomart alone is able to rescue Amoret from the wizard Busirane. Unfortunately, when they emerge from the castle Scudamore is gone. (The 1590 version with Books I\u2013III depicts the lovers' happy reunion, but this was changed in the 1596 version which contained all six books.)\nBook IV is called \"The Legend of Cambell and Telamond, or Of Friendship\" \u2013 but, despite its title, Cambell's companion in Book IV is actually named Triamond, and the plot does not center on their friendship; the two men appear only briefly in the story. The book is largely a continuation of events begun in Book III. First, Scudamore is convinced by the hag Ate (discord) that Britomart has run off with Amoret and becomes jealous. A three-day tournament is then held by Satyrane, where Britomart beats Artegall (both in disguise). Scudamore and Artegall unite against Britomart, but when her helmet comes off in battle Artegall falls in love with her. He surrenders, removes his helmet, and Britomart recognizes him as the man in the enchanted mirror. Artegall pledges his love to her but must first leave and complete his quest. Scudamore, upon discovering Britomart's sex, realizes his mistake and asks after his lady, but by this time Britomart has lost Amoret, and she and Scudamore embark together on a search for her. The reader discovers that Amoret was abducted by a savage man and is imprisoned in his cave. One day Amoret darts out past the savage and is rescued from him by the squire Timias and Belphoebe. Arthur then appears, offering his service as a knight to the lost woman. She accepts, and after a couple of trials on the way, Arthur and Amoret finally happen across Scudamore and Britomart. The two lovers are reunited. Wrapping up a different plotline from Book III, the recently recovered Marinell discovers Florimell suffering in Proteus' dungeon. He returns home and becomes sick with love and pity. Eventually he confesses his feelings to his mother, and she pleads with Neptune to have the girl released, which the god grants.\nBook V is centred on the virtue of Justice as embodied in Sir Artegall, who defeats a demagogic giant and mediates several conflicts, including a joust held in honor of Florimell's nuptials. The knight then attempts to free several men from their indenture to the Amazon Radigund. She defeats Artegall in battle by guile, and, according to the terms of their duel, he, a stickler for legal agreements, must become her slave as well. Britomart eventually rescues her betrothed and kills Radigund, thereby restoring a just relationship of the sexes. We are introduced to the court of Mercilla, where Duessa is put on trial and found guilty. Departing from Artegall, Spenser presents Prince Arthur's quest to slay the beast Gerioneo in order to restore the lady Belge to her rights. In the final canto, Artegall aids Sir Burbon and slays the monstrous Grantorto.\nBook VI is centred on the virtue of Courtesy as embodied in Sir Calidore, who is on a mission from the Faerie Queene to slay the Blatant Beast. After helping reconcile two lovers and taking on the courteous young Tristram as his page, he falls prey to the pleasant distractions of pastoral life and eventually wins the affections of Pastorella away from the ultimately agreeable but somewhat cowardly Coridon. This book also features the knight Calepine and his quest for his lady Serena, who is cared for by a strangely well-mannered Savage who, like the humble Pastorella, turns out to be a long-lost scion of nobility; Arthur later takes on Serena and leaves her to the care of his page Timias and a Hermit who has been a knight. Calidore rescues his love from the Blatant Beast, capturing and binding the monster, which nonetheless, we are told, eventually escapes to prowl about the world once more to seek the ruin of more reputations.\nPublished with \"The Faerie Queene\" in the Folio of 1609 and generally agreed to have been part of Spenser's plan for Book VII are the Cantos of Mutability, in which Jove's sway over the universe is challenged by Mutability, the Titan goddess of change, who takes her case to a court presided over by Nature, who, after spirited arguments on both sides, rules against the Titaness and in favor of Jove.\nThemes.\nAllegory of virtue.\nA letter written by Spenser to Sir Walter Raleigh in 1590 contains a preface for \"The Faerie Queene\", in which Spenser describes the allegorical presentation of virtues through Arthurian knights in the mythical \"Faerieland\". Presented as a preface to the epic in most published editions, this letter outlines plans for twenty-four books: twelve based each on a different knight who exemplified one of twelve \"private virtues\", and a possible twelve more centred on King Arthur displaying twelve \"public virtues\". Spenser names Aristotle as his source for these virtues, though the influences of Thomas Aquinas and the traditions of medieval allegory can be observed as well. It is impossible to predict how the work would have looked had Spenser lived to complete it, since the reliability of the predictions made in his letter to Raleigh is not absolute, as numerous divergences from that scheme emerged as early as 1590 in the first \"Faerie Queene\" publication.\nIn addition to the six virtues Holiness, Temperance, Chastity, Friendship, Justice, and Courtesy, the Letter to Raleigh suggests that Arthur represents the virtue of Magnificence, which (\"according to Aristotle and the rest\") is \"the perfection of all the rest, and containeth in it them all\"; and that the Faerie Queene herself represents Glory (hence her name, Gloriana). The unfinished seventh book (the Cantos of Mutability) appears to have represented the virtue of \"constancy\".\nReligion.\n\"The Faerie Queene\" was written during the Reformation, a time of religious and political controversy. After taking the throne following the death of her half-sister Mary, Elizabeth changed the official religion of the nation to Protestantism. The plot of book one is similar to \"Foxe's Book of Martyrs\", which was about the persecution of the Protestants and how Catholic rule was unjust. Spenser includes the controversy of Elizabethan church reform within the epic. Gloriana has godly English knights destroy Catholic continental power in Books I and V. Spenser also endows many of his villains with \"the worst of what Protestants considered a superstitious Catholic reliance on deceptive images\".\nPolitics.\nThe poem celebrates, memorializes, and critiques the House of Tudor (of which Elizabeth was a part), much as Virgil's \"Aeneid\" celebrates Augustus's Rome. The \"Aeneid\" states that Augustus descended from the noble sons of Troy; similarly, \"The Faerie Queene\" suggests that the Tudor lineage can be connected to King Arthur. The poem is deeply allegorical and allusive; many prominent Elizabethans could have found themselves partially represented by one or more of Spenser's figures. Elizabeth herself is the most prominent example. She appears in the guise of Gloriana, the Faerie Queen, but also in Books III and IV as the virgin Belphoebe, daughter of Chrysogonee and twin to Amoret, the embodiment of womanly married love. Perhaps also, more critically, Elizabeth is seen in Book I as Lucifera, the \"maiden queen\" whose brightly lit Court of Pride masks a dungeon full of prisoners.\nThe poem also displays Spenser's thorough familiarity with literary history. The world of \"The Faerie Queene\" is based on English Arthurian legend, but much of the language, spirit, and style of the piece draw more on Italian epic, particularly Ludovico Ariosto's \"Orlando Furioso\" and Torquato Tasso's \"Jerusalem Delivered\".\nBook V of \"The Faerie Queene\", the Book of Justice, is Spenser's most direct discussion of political theory. In it, Spenser attempts to tackle the problem of policy toward Ireland and recreates the trial of Mary, Queen of Scots.\nArchetypes.\nIn \"The Faerie Queene\", Edmund Spenser employs archetypal patterns to reinforce the actuality of his narrative. Spenser integrates these patterns to focus the meaning of the past on the present, emphasizing the significance of Elizabeth's reign by converting myth into event rather than the other way around. This approach blurs the lines between archetypal and historical elements within the poem. For instance, the British Chronicle, which Arthur reads in the House of Alma, serves as a poetical equivalent for factual history despite its partially imaginary nature. This kind of poetical history is distinct from myth, as it consists of unique events recorded in chronological order. This distinction is evident in the political allegory of Books I and V, where the reality of interpreted events becomes more apparent when the events are closer to the time of the poem's composition.\nThroughout \"The Faerie Queene\", Spenser's use of archetypal patterns includes numerous mythological equivalents that enhance the narrative's depth and complexity. For example, the characters Florimell and Marinell are related to the myths of Proserpine and Adonis, respectively. Florimell, much like Eurydice, represents the pursuit of the unattainable, highlighting themes of purity and chastity. Marinell's link to Adonis underscores the fragility and vulnerability inherent in beauty and desire.\nSimilarly, the characters Una and Redcross can be seen as archetypal representations of divine grace and the Christian Church in England. Una, equated with Dante's Beatrice, embodies the archetype of divine wisdom and truth, guiding Redcross on his spiritual journey. This alignment with Beatrice also emphasizes Una's role as a symbol of divine grace leading to salvation. Redcross, representing the archetypal Christian Everyman, embarks on a quest that mirrors the soul's journey toward holiness. His ultimate victory over the dragon symbolizes the archetypal triumph of good over evil and the attainment of spiritual purity.\nSymbolism and allusion.\nThroughout \"The Faerie Queene\", Spenser creates \"a network of allusions to events, issues, and particular persons in England and Ireland\" including Mary, Queen of Scots, the Spanish Armada, the English Reformation, and even the Queen herself. It is also known that James VI of Scotland read the poem, and was very insulted by Duessa \u2013 a very negative depiction of his mother, Mary, Queen of Scots. \"The Faerie Queene\" was then banned in Scotland. This led to a significant decrease in Elizabeth's support for the poem. Within the text, both the Faerie Queene and Belphoebe serve as two of the many personifications of Queen Elizabeth, some of which are \"far from complimentary\".\nThough it praises her in some ways, \"The Faerie Queene\" questions Elizabeth's ability to rule so effectively because of her gender, and also inscribes the \"shortcomings\" of her rule. There is a character named Britomart who represents married chastity. This character is told that her destiny is to be an \"immortal womb\", to have children. Here, Spenser is referring to Elizabeth's unmarried state and is touching on anxieties of the 1590s about what would happen after her death since the kingdom had no heir.\n\"The Faerie Queene's\" original audience would have been able to identify many of the poem's characters by analyzing the symbols and attributes that spot Spenser's text. For example, readers would immediately know that \"a woman who wears scarlet clothes and resides along the Tiber River represents the Roman Catholic Church\". However, marginal notes jotted in early copies of \"The Faerie Queene\" suggest that Spenser's contemporaries were unable to come to a consensus about the precise historical referents of the poem's \"myriad figures\". Sir Walter Raleigh's wife identified many of the poem's female characters as \"allegorical representations of herself\".\nOther symbols prevalent in \"The Faerie Queene\" are the numerous animal characters present in the poem. They take the role of \"visual figures in the allegory and in illustrative similes and metaphors\". Examples include the swine present in Lucifera's castle who embodied gluttony, and Duessa, the deceitful crocodile who may represent Mary, Queen of Scots, in a negative light.\nThe House of Busirane episode in Book III in \"The Faerie Queene\" is partially based on an early modern English folktale called \"Mr Fox's Mottos\". In the tale, a young woman named Lady Mary has been enticed by Mr Fox, who resembles Bluebeard in his manner of killing his wives. She defeats Mr. Fox and tells about his deeds. Notably, Spenser quotes the story as Britomart makes her way through the House, with warning mottos above each doorway \"Be bold, be bold, but not too bold\".\nComposition.\nSpenser's intentions.\nWhile writing his poem, Spenser strove to avoid \"gealous opinions and misconstructions\" because he thought it would place his story in a \"better light\" for his readers. Spenser stated in his letter to Raleigh, published with the first three books, that \"the general end of the book is to fashion a gentleman or noble person in virtuous and gentle discipline\". Spenser considered his work \"a historical fiction\" which men should read for \"delight\" rather than \"the profit of the ensample\". \"The Faerie Queene\" was written for Elizabeth to read and was dedicated to her. However, there are dedicatory sonnets in the first edition to many powerful Elizabethan figures.\nSpenser addresses \"Lodwick\" in \"Amoretti\" 33, when talking about \"The Faerie Queene\" still being incomplete. This could be either his friend Lodowick Bryskett or his long-deceased Italian model Ludovico Ariosto, whom he praises in \"Letter to Raleigh\".\nDedication.\nThe poem is dedicated to Elizabeth I, who is represented in the poem as the Faerie Queene Gloriana, as well as the character Belphoebe. Spenser prefaces the poem with sonnets additionally dedicated to Sir Christopher Hatton, Lord Burleigh, the Earl of Oxford, the Earl of Northumberland, the Earl of Cumberland, the Earl of Essex, the Earl of Ormond and Ossory, High Admiral Charles Howard, Lord Hunsdon, Lord Grey of Wilton, Lord Buckhurst, Sir Francis Walsingham, Sir John Norris, Sir Walter Raleigh, the Countess of Pembroke (on the subject of her brother Sir Philip Sidney), and Lady Carew.\nSocial commentary.\nIn October 1589, after nine years in Ireland, Spenser voyaged to England and saw the Queen. It is possible that he read to her from his manuscript at this time. On 25 February 1591, the Queen gave him a pension of fifty pounds per year. He was paid in four instalments on 25 March, 24 June, 29 September, and 25 December.\nAfter the first three books of \"The Faerie Queene\" were published in 1590, Spenser found himself disappointed in the monarchy; among other things, \"his annual pension from the Queen was smaller than he would have liked\" and his humanist perception of Elizabeth's court \"was shattered by what he saw there\". Despite these frustrations, however, Spenser \"kept his aristocratic prejudices and predispositions\". Book VI stresses that there is \"almost no correlation between noble deeds and low birth\" and reveals that to be a \"noble person\", one must be a \"gentleman of choice stock\".\nThroughout \"The Faerie Queene\", virtue is seen as \"a feature for the nobly born\" and within Book VI, readers encounter worthy deeds that indicate aristocratic lineage. An example of this is the hermit to whom Arthur brings Timias and Serena. Initially, the man is considered a \"goodly knight of a gentle race\" who \"withdrew from public service to religious life when he grew too old to fight\". Here, we note the hermit's noble blood seems to have influenced his gentle, selfless behaviour. Likewise, audiences acknowledge that young Tristram \"speaks so well and acts so heroically\" that Calidore \"frequently contributes him with noble birth\" even before learning his background; in fact, it is no surprise that Tristram turns out to be the son of a king, explaining his profound intellect. However, Spenser's most peculiar example of noble birth is demonstrated through the characterization of the Salvage Man. Using the Salvage Man as an example, Spenser demonstrated that \"ungainly appearances do not disqualify one from noble birth\". By giving the Salvage Man a \"frightening exterior\", Spenser stresses that \"virtuous deeds are a more accurate indication of gentle blood than physical appearance.\nOn the opposite side of the spectrum, \"The Faerie Queene\" indicates qualities such as cowardice and discourtesy that signify low birth. During his initial encounter with Arthur, Turpine \"hides behind his retainers, chooses ambush from behind instead of direct combat, and cowers to his wife, who covers him with her voluminous skirt\". These actions demonstrate that Turpine is \"morally emasculated by fear\" and furthermore, \"the usual social roles are reversed as the lady protects the knight from danger. Scholars believe that this characterization serves as \"a negative example of knighthood\" and strives to teach Elizabethan aristocrats how to \"identify a commoner with political ambitions inappropriate to his rank\".\nPoetic structure.\n\"The Faerie Queene\" was written in Spenserian stanza, which Spenser created specifically for \"The Faerie Queene\". Spenser varied existing epic stanza forms, the rhyme royal used by Chaucer with the rhyme pattern ABABBCC, and the \"ottava rima\" with the rhyme pattern ABABABCC. Spenser's stanza is the longest of the three, with nine iambic lines. The first eight lines are five-footed, that is, pentameters. The ninth line is six-footed, that is, a hexameter, or Alexandrine. Altogether these form two \"interlocking quatrains and a final couplet\". The rhyme pattern is ABABBCBCC. Over two thousand stanzas were written for the 1590 \"Faerie Queene\".\nTheological structure.\nIn Elizabethan England, no subject was more familiar to writers than theology. Elizabethans learned to embrace religious studies in petty school, where they \"read from selections from the Book of Common Prayer and memorized Catechisms from the Scriptures\". This influence is evident in Spenser's text, as demonstrated in the moral allegory of Book I. Here, allegory is organized in the traditional arrangement of Renaissance theological treatises and confessionals. While reading Book I, audiences first encounter original sin, justification and the nature of sin before analysing the church and the sacraments. Despite this pattern, Book I is not a theological treatise; within the text, \"moral and historical allegories intermingle\" and the reader encounters elements of romance. However, Spenser's method is not \"a rigorous and unyielding allegory\", but \"a compromise among conflicting elements\". In Book I of \"The Faerie Queene\" the discussion of the path to salvation begins with original sin and justification, skipping past initial matters of God, the Creeds, and Adam's fall from grace. This literary decision is pivotal because these doctrines \"center the fundamental theological controversies of the Reformation\".\nSources.\nMyth and history.\nDuring \"The Faerie Queene\"'s inception, Spenser worked as a civil servant, in \"relative seclusion from the political and literary events of his day\". As Spenser laboured in solitude, \"The Faerie Queene\" manifested within his mind, blending his experiences into the content of his craft. Within his poem, Spenser explores human consciousness and conflict, relating to a variety of genres including sixteenth century Arthurian literature. \"The Faerie Queene\" was influenced strongly by Italian works, as were many other works in England at that time. \"The Faerie Queene\" draws heavily on Ariosto and Tasso.\nThe first three books of \"The Faerie Queene\" operate as a unit, representing the entire cycle from the fall of Troy to the reign of Elizabeth. Using \"in medias res\", Spenser introduces his historical narrative at three different intervals, using chronicle, civil conversation, and prophecy as its occasions.\nDespite the historical elements of his text, Spenser is careful to label himself a historical poet as opposed to a historiographer. Spenser notes this differentiation in his letter to Raleigh, noting \"a Historiographer discourseth of affairs orderly as they were done\u00a0... but a Poet thrusteth into the midst\u00a0... and maketh a pleasing Analysis of all\".\nSpenser's characters embody Elizabethan values, highlighting political and aesthetic associations of Tudor Arthurian tradition in order to bring his work to life. While Spenser respected British history and \"contemporary culture confirmed his attitude\", his literary freedom demonstrates that he was \"working in the realm of mythopoeic imagination rather than that of historical fact\". In fact, Spenser's Arthurian material serves as a subject of debate, intermediate between \"legendary history and historical myth\" offering him a range of \"evocative tradition and freedom that historian's responsibilities preclude\". Concurrently, Spenser adopts the role of a sceptic, reflected in the way in which he handles the British history, which \"extends to the verge of self-satire\".\nMedieval subject matter.\n\"The Faerie Queene\" owes, in part, its central figure, Arthur, to a medieval writer, Geoffrey of Monmouth. In his \"Prophetiae Merlini\" (\"Prophecies of Merlin\"), Geoffrey's Merlin proclaims that the Saxons will rule over the Britons until the \"Boar of Cornwall\" (Arthur) again restores them to their rightful place as rulers. The prophecy was adopted by the Welsh and eventually used by the Tudors. Through their ancestor, Owen Tudor, the Tudors had Welsh blood, through which they claimed to be descendants of Arthur and rightful rulers of Britain. The tradition begun by Geoffrey of Monmouth set the perfect atmosphere for Spenser's choice of Arthur as the central figure and natural bridegroom of Gloriana.\nLanguage and diction.\nArchaisms.\nSpenser's language in \"The Faerie Queene\", as in the earlier \"The Shepheardes Calender\", is in part deliberately archaic. Seventeenth-century philologist Sir William Davenant considered Spenser's use of \"obsolete language\" as the \"most vulgar accusation that is laid to his charge\". Samuel Johnson found Spenser's writings \"a useful source for obsolete and archaic words\", but also asserted that \"in affecting the ancients Spenser writ no language\". Herbert Wilfred Sugden argues in \"The Grammar of Spenser's Faerie Queene\" that the archaisms reside \"chiefly in vocabulary, to a high degree in spelling, to some extent in the inflexions, and only slightly in the syntax\".\nExamples of medieval archaisms (in morphology and diction) include:\nAllowing that Johnson's remark may only apply to Spenser's \"Calender\", Bruce Robert McElderry Jr. states, after a detailed investigation of \"The Faerie Queene\"'s diction, that Johnson's statement \"is a skillful epigram; but it seriously misrepresents the truth if taken at anything like its face value\". The number of archaisms used in the poem is not overwhelming\u2014one source reports thirty-four in Canto I of Book I, that is, thirty-four words out of a total forty-two hundred words, less than one percent. According to McElderry, language alone does not account for the poem's archaic tone. \"The subject-matter of \"The Faerie Queene\" is itself the most powerful factor in creating the impression of archaism.\"\nClassical references.\n\"The Faerie Queene\" relies on classical vocabulary and proper names, especially in the later books. Spenser coined names based on Greek, such as \"Poris\" and \"Phao lilly-white\". \nOne scholar argued that both classical epic literature and Spenser's work \"involve[s] the principles of imitation and decorum\", which explains and justifies the use of classical vocabulary and forms.\nOverall assessment.\nSpenser is \"a conscious literary artist\", and his language is \"the only fitting vehicle for his tone of thought and feelings\". Spenser's language may be contrasted with that of the \"free and unregulated\" grammar of Shakespeare. Overall, Spenser's style is standardized, lyrically sophisticated and occasionally archaic, all of which give the poem its character.\nAdaptation and derivative works.\nNumerous adaptations in the form of children's literature have been made \u2013 the work was a popular choice in the 19th and early 20th century with over 20 different versions written, with the earliest being E. W. Bradburn's \"Legends from Spencer's Fairy Queen, for Children\" (1829), written in the form of a dialogue between mother and children. 19th-century adaptations often concentrated on the moral aspect of the tale. Adaptions of the work were more popular in the United Kingdom than in the United States.\nThe Edwardian era was particularly rich in adaptation for children, and the works richly illustrated, with contributing artists including A. G. Walker, Gertrude Demain Hammond, T. H. Robinson, Frank C. Pap\u00e9, Brinsley Le Fanu, and H. J. Ford. Additionally, Walter Crane illustrated a six-volume collection of the complete work, published 1897, considered a great example of the Arts and Crafts movement.\nIn \"The Mathematics of Magic\", the second of Fletcher Pratt and L. Sprague de Camp's Harold Shea stories, the modern American adventurers Harold Shea and Reed Chalmers visit the world of \"The Faerie Queene\", where they discover that the greater difficulties faced by Spenser's knights in the later portions of the poem are explained by the evil enchanters of the piece having organized a guild to more effectively oppose them. Shea and Chalmers reveal this conspiracy to the knights and assist in its overthrow. In the process, Belphebe and Florimel of Faerie become respectively the wives of Shea and Chalmers and accompany them on further adventures in other worlds of myth and fantasy.\nA considerable part of Elizabeth Bear's \"Promethean Age\" series takes place in a Kingdom of Faerie which is loosely based on the one described by Spenser. As depicted by Bear, Spenser was aware of this Kingdom's existence and his work was actually a description of fact rather than invented fantasy; Queen Elizabeth I had a secret pact of mutual help with the Queen of Faerie; and such historical characters as Christopher Marlowe and William Shakespeare visited Faerie and had adventures there.\nAccording to Richard Simon Keller, George Lucas's \"Star Wars\" film also contains elements of a loose adaptation, as well as being influenced by other works, with parallels including the story of the Red Cross Knight championing Una against the evil Archimago in the original compared with Lucas's Luke Skywalker, Princess Leia, and Darth Vader. Keller sees extensive parallels between the film and book one of Spenser's work, stating \"[A]lmost everything of importance that we see in the \"Star Wars\" movie has its origin in \"The Faerie Queene\", from small details of weaponry and dress to large issues of chivalry and spirituality\".\nReferences in popular culture.\nThe Netflix series \"The Crown\" references \"The Faerie Queene\" and Gloriana in season 1 episode 10, entitled \"Gloriana\". In the final scene, Queen Elizabeth II, portrayed by Claire Foy, is being photographed. Prompting Her Majesty's poses, Cecil Beaton says:\"All hail sage Lady, whom a grateful Isle hath blessed.\" Not moving, not breathing. Our very own goddess. \"Glorious Gloriana\". Forgetting Elizabeth Windsor now. Now only Elizabeth Regina. Yes.\nNear the end of the 1995 adaptation of \"Sense and Sensibility\", Colonel Brandon reads \"The Faerie Queene\" aloud to Marianne Dashwood.\nQuotes from the poem are used as epigraphs in \"Troubled Blood\" by Robert Galbraith, a pen name of J. K. Rowling.\nIn the \"Thursday Next\" series by Jasper Fforde, Granny Next (who is an older version of Thursday Next herself) is condemned to reading the \"ten most boring classics\" before she can die. She finally passes away after reading \"The Faerie Queene\".\nAn early, influential text-based computer game that was based on the \"Star Trek\" television show, originally entitled \"Star Trek\" and later \"Super Star Trek\", was published in 1971 by Mike Mayfield. In one of the first instances of respawning in a computer game, the player could abandon ship if the USS \"Enterprise\" became too damaged to continue fighting, in which case the replacement ship was named the \"Faerie Queene\".\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

FAIA (9 January 1898 \u2013 19 June 1990) was a Danish architect and urban planner who was a professor at the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts, and a prolific writer of books and poetry. He was made a Royal Designer for Industry by the British Royal Society of Arts in 1947.\nEarly life and education.\nSteen Eiler Rasmussen was born on 19 February 1898 in Copenhagen to Lieutenant colonel and later general Christian Rasmussen and Anna Dorthea (Dori) Jung. He first apprenticed as a mason and then studied architecture at the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts from 1916 to 1918. In 1919 he set up his own practice.\nArchitecture and urban planning.\nIt was mainly as an urban planner that he made his name. He was part of the Danish Urban Planning Laboratory from 1924, as the Academy Council's representative, and its leader from 1942 to 1948. From 1932 to 1938 he worked at Copenhagen Municipality's Department for Urban Planning.\nThrough his involvement in the Urban Planning Laboratory, he was an important part of the process which led to the Finger Plan which has governed the overall development of suburban Copenhagen ever since. He also co-planned the area Tingbjerg town (yellow brickstone and greens) with C.Th. S\u00f8rensen in Copenhagen North West, as well as the town H\u00f8rsholm.\nAmong the buildings he has designed are Ringsted Town Hall, M\u00f8drehj\u00e6lpen (a social institution for women) in Copenhagen \u00d8 and his own house in Rungsted Kyst H\u00f8rsholm, north of Copenhagen(1938).\nAcademia.\nRasmussen was a lecturer at the Academy from 1924 and became a professor in 1936. Among his students were J\u00f8rn Utzon, designer of the Sydney Opera House, and Marian Pepler who designed rugs for Gordon Russell in the 1930s .\nWritings.\nOne of Rasmussen's most influential books was \"Experiencing Architecture\", first published in Danish in 1957 and in English in 1959. Underlining the importance of a first-person, embodied experience of architecture - including its shape, color, scale, proportion, rhythm, textural effects, daylight and sound - the book may be regarded as a classic in architectural phenomenology.\nAnother important book was \"London\". It was first published in Danish in 1934, in English (as \"London, the Unique City\") in 1937. When this edition was re-issued in 1948, Rasmussen had added two Postscripts: \"For English readers only\", and \"For American readers only\". A shorter version was published as a paperback in 1960.\nOther influential books by Rasmussen include \"Towns and Buildings\" (1951) and \"K\u00f8benhavn\" (1969).\nAmong his many friends was Edmund N.

{"id": "76080", "revid": "22619", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=76080", "title": "John Hanning Speke", "text": "English explorer and army officer (1827\u20131864)\nJohn Hanning Speke (4 May 1827\u00a0\u2013 15 September 1864) was an English explorer and army officer who made three exploratory expeditions to Africa. He is most associated with the search for the source of the Nile (known to locals as \"Kiyira\" in Luganda) and was the first European to reach Lake Victoria (known to locals as \"Nam Lolwe\" in Dholuo and \"Nnalubaale\" in Luganda or \"Ukerewe\").\nLife.\nSpeke was born on 4 May 1827 at Orleigh Court, Buckland Brewer, near Bideford, North Devon. In 1844 he was commissioned into the Bengal Army and posted to British India, where he served in the 46th Regiment of Bengal Native Infantry under Sir Hugh Gough during the Punjab campaign and under Sir Colin Campbell during the First Anglo-Sikh War. He was promoted lieutenant in 1850 and captain in 1852. He spent his leave exploring the Himalayan Mountains and Mount Everest and once crossed into Tibet.\nIn 1854 he made his first voyage to Africa, first arriving in Aden to ask permission of the Political Resident of this British Outpost to cross the Gulf of Aden and collect specimens in Somalia for his family's natural history museum in Somerset. This was refused as Somalia was considered rather dangerous. Speke then asked to join an expedition about to leave for Somalia led by the already famous Richard Burton who had Lt William Stroyan and Lt. Herne recruited to come along, but a recent death left the expedition one person short. Speke was accepted because he had traveled in remote regions alone before, had experience collecting and preserving natural history specimens and had done astronomical surveying. Initially the party split with Burton going to Harrar, Abyssinia, and Speke going to Wadi Nogal in Somalia. \nDuring this trip Speke experienced trouble with the local guide, who cheated him; after they returned to Aden, Burton, who had also returned, saw that the guide was punished, jailed and killed. This incident probably led to larger troubles later on. Then all four men traveled to Berbera on the coast of Somalia, from where they wanted to trek inland towards the Ogaden. While camped outside Berbera, they were attacked at night by 200 spear-wielding Somalis. During this fracas Speke ducked under the flap of a tent to get a clearer view of the scene, and Burton thought he was retreating and called for Speke to stand firm. Speke did so and then charged forward with great courage, shooting several attackers. The misunderstanding laid the foundation of their later disputes and dislikes. Stroyan was killed by a spear, Burton was seriously wounded by a javelin impaling both cheeks and Speke was wounded and captured; Herne came away unwounded. Speke was tied up and stabbed several times with spears, one thrust cutting through his thigh along his femur and exiting. Showing tremendous determination, he used his bound fists to give his attacker a facial punch; this gave him an opportunity to escape, albeit he was followed by a group of Somalis and had to dodge spears as he ran for his life. Rejoining Burton and Herne, the trio eventually managed to escape with a boat passing along the coast. The expedition was a severe financial loss, and Speke's natural history specimens from his earlier leg were used to make up for some of it. Speke handed Burton his diaries, which Burton used as an appendix in his own book on his travels to Harrar. It seemed unlikely that the two would join again and Burton believed that he would never lead an expedition to the interior of Africa, his fervent hope, after this failed journey. \nSearch for the Nile source 1856\u20131859.\nIn 1856, Speke and Burton went to East Africa to find the Great Lakes, which were rumoured to exist in the centre of the continent. It was hoped that the expedition would locate the source of the Nile. The journey, which started from Zanzibar Island in June 1857, where they stayed at the residence of Atkins Hamerton, the British consul, was extremely strenuous and both men fell ill from a variety of tropical diseases once they went inland. Most of the day to day work of exploration was carried out by a large, diverse, and changing labour force of porters, soldiers, and guides, and cooks. \nBy 7\u00a0November 1857, they had traveled over 600 miles on foot and donkey and reached Kazeh (Tabora), where they rested and recuperated among Arab slave traders who had a settlement there. In Kazeh Burton became gravely ill and Speke went temporarily blind as they travelled further west. After an arduous journey, the two arrived in Ujiji in February 1858 and became the first Europeans to reach Lake Tanganyika (although Speke was partially blind at this point and could not properly see the lake). They decided to explore the lake, but it was vast and they could get only small canoes from the locals. Burton was too ill to journey, and thus Speke crossed the lake with a small crew and some canoes to try to rent a larger vessel from an Arab who, they were told, had a large boat and lived on the west side of the lake. (Lake Tanganyika is over 400 miles long on the north\u2013south axis but only about 30 miles wide.) During this trip Speke, marooned on an island, suffered severely when he became temporarily deaf after a beetle crawled into his ear and he tried to remove it with a knife. Unable to rent the larger vessel from the Arab, Speke returned. The pair were unable to explore Lake Tanganyika properly and they initially misunderstood that a river flowed out of it from the north side. A few weeks later the explorer and guide Sidi Mubarak Bombay confirmed via locals that the river flowed into the lake; however, since neither man actually saw this river, this remained a source of speculation.\nSpeke's travels to Lake Victoria.\nThey had also heard of a second lake to the north-east, and in May 1858, they decided to explore it on the way back to the coast. But Burton was too weak to make the trip and thus stayed in base camp when the main caravan halted again at Kazeh. Speke went on a 47-day side trip that was 452 miles up and down in which he took 34 men with Bombay and Mabruki as his captains and on 30 July 1858 became the first European to see Lake Victoria, known to locals as Nam Lolwe in the Dholuo language and Nnalubaale in the Luganda language or Ukerewe . Speke renamed the lake after the British monarch, Queen Victoria, and was one of the first persons to map it. It was this lake that eventually proved to be the source of the River Nile. However, much of the expedition's survey equipment had been lost at this point and thus vital questions about the height and extent of the lake could not be answered easily. Speke's eyes were still bothering him and he only saw a small part of the southern end of the lake and his view was blocked by islands in the lake so he could not judge the size of the lake well. However, Speke did estimate the elevation of Lake Victoria at 4000 feet by observing the temperature at which water boiled at that level. (This lake's being substantially higher than Lake Tanganyika did make it a more likely candidate for the source of the Nile.)\nFrom the beginning, the relationship of Speke and Burton was one of opposites; Burton considered Speke inferior linguistically and a less experienced traveller in remote regions (which was partially true), but Burton himself appears to have been jealous and far less able to relate to the safari caravan to keep the expedition motivated and moving (a vital factor as they were completely dependent on their safari crew). While Speke enjoyed hunting and thus provided the caravan with meat, Burton was not much interested in such pursuits. Burton was appointed the head of the expedition and considered Speke the second in command, although the pair seemed to have shared the hardships and labours of the journey pretty much evenly. Once it became clear that Speke might have found the source of the Nile the relationship deteriorated further. Why Burton did not journey back to Lake Victoria with Speke to make a better reconnaissance of the Lake after Speke returned to base camp in Kazeh is unclear. Burton was incapacitated and had to be carried by bearers but this had been true for a great deal of the trip.\nWhile Speke and Burton were instrumental in bringing the source of the Nile to the wider world and were the first to record and map this section of Africa, the efforts and labours of Sidi Mubarak Bombay and Mabruki were instrumental in the discovery of the lake. Bombay was captured as a child near Lake Nyasa by slave traders and was sold to Indian merchants on the coast of Africa who took him to Sindh. Thus he spoke Hindustani, and after his master's death he sailed back to Zanzibar, where Speke and Burton met and hired him. Both spoke Hindustani, which greatly facilitated the travel in the interior as Bombay spoke several native languages beside Swahili. Speke was much attached to Bombay and spoke highly of his honesty and conscientiousness. Bombay's efforts in dealing with hostile tribes, interpreting and keeping the safari crew on track, was a great help to the expedition. Less is known of Mabruki, the other caravan leader, but he was later known as Mabruki Speke, and like Bombay became one of East Africa's great caravan leaders and was also a member of the Yao tribe like Bombay. Because of Speke's recommendations, both Bombay and Mabruki served on Henry Stanley's 1871 expedition to find Livingstone.\nReturn to England and debate over the source of the Nile.\nOn 26 September 1858 the return journey from Kazeh was started with 152 porters; both men had to return as their military leaves were coming to an end, although Jeal contends that they could have extended the trip by asking for an extension, as their clear mission statement of the Royal Geographical Society (RGS) was to find the source of the Nile. The expedition had lost a great many people through desertions, disease and hostilities, but in Kazeh, on the return journey, Mabruki had recruited local porters. Again Speke and Burton suffered from severe illnesses and had to be carried in a litter (machilla) by the porters some of the way. Once Speke and Burton were back on the coast they went by ship to Zanzibar and then travelled to Aden. Once in Aden, Burton was not granted a medical certificate to travel and thus Speke left on HMS \"Furious\" and arrived in England on 8 May 1859. Burton was not far behind and he arrived on 21 May 1859. When back at the coast Burton had written a letter to Norton Shaw of the Royal Geographical Society (which had partially sponsored the journey) in which Burton enclosed a map of Lake Victoria made by Speke and wrote \"there are grave reasons for believing it (the lake) to be the source of the principal feeder of the White Nile.\"\nNow further disagreements developed; Burton maintained that they had promised each other in Aden not to make public announcements till they both were back in England and Burton accused Speke of a breach of promise for publicly claiming that the source of the Nile was found on their trip. Burton now turned against the theory that Lake Victoria was the source of the Nile (and now said the river flowing \"out\" of the north side of Lake Tanganyika was the source) and thus also reversed himself from the position he took in the letter to Norton Shaw. In that same letter to Shaw, Burton had also stated that Speke would present his findings to the RGS, as he was prevented from traveling because of poor health and would be in England a short time after Speke. Jeal concludes that Burton's claim of a promise from Speke not to go to the RGS was improbable. The jealousies and accusations between the two men got ever greater, further inflamed by their respective circles of friends and people who stood to gain from the feud such as book publishers and newspapers. Burton was still extremely weak, and once he appeared in front of a committee of the RGS he was not able to make a convincing case for his leading a second expedition to settle the outstanding matters about the Nile. The rift widened, and perhaps became irreversible, when Speke was chosen to lead a subsequent expedition instead of Burton. The two presented joint papers concerning the expedition to the Royal Geographical Society on 13 June 1859.\nSecond journey to the source of the Nile, 1860\u20131861.\nTogether with James Augustus Grant, Speke left Portsmouth on 27 April 1860 and departed from Zanzibar in October 1860. The expedition approached the lake from the south west but Grant was often sick and was not able to travel with Speke much of the time. As during the first trip, in this period of history, Arab slave traders had created an atmosphere of great distrust towards any foreigners entering central Africa, and most tribes either fled or fought when encountering them as they assumed all outsiders to be potential slavers. Lacking a great deal of guns and soldiers, the only thing the expedition could do was make peace offerings to locals, and both men were severely delayed and their supplies depleted by demands for gifts and passage fees by smaller local chieftains. After numerous months of delays Speke reached Lake Victoria on 28 July 1862, and then travelled on the west side around Lake Victoria but only seeing it from time to time; but on the north side of the lake, Speke found the Nile flowing out of it and discovered the Ripon Falls. \nLocal Church Missionary Society records indicate that Speke fathered a daughter whilst staying at the court of Muteesa I the Kabaka (or King) of Buganda. Whilst staying at the court Speke was given two girls aged about 12 and 18 from the entourage of the Queen Mother. Speke appears to have had sexual relations with both of them, before handing over the youngest (whom he named 'Kahala') to another man. Speke fell in love with the elder girl, 'Meri', according to his diaries (which were redacted when they were published as books later). While Meri proved loyal to Speke and fulfilled her task at being a \"wife\" to him as commanded by the Queen Mother, Speke was distressed because he thought she had no love or deep attachment to him. He \"divorced her on the spot\" in April 1862 after she defied his orders regarding the sacrifice of a goat. Whilst Meri visited Speke several times after this incident, the couple did not reconcile. Speke claimed to have tried to arrange a better relationship for Meri with another man, without success it seems.\nFinally, given permission by Muteesa in June 1862 to leave, Speke then travelled down the Nile now reunited with Grant. Because of travel restrictions placed by the local chieftains, slave raiding parties, tribal wars and the difficulty of the terrain, Speke was not able to map the entire flow of the Nile from Lake Victoria north. Why he did not make more efforts to do so is not clear, but the enormous hardships of the journey must have played a large role. By January 1863 Speke and Grant reached Gondokoro in Southern Sudan, where he met Samuel Baker and his \"wife\". (Her name was Florence von Sass and she had been rescued by Baker from a slave market in Vidin during a hunting trip in Bulgaria.) Speke had expected to meet John Petherick and his wife Katherine at Gondokoro, as they had been sent by the RGS south along the Nile to meet Speke and Grant. However the Pethericks were not there but on a side expedition to trade ivory, as they had run out of funds for their expedition. This caused some hard feelings between Petherick and Speke, and Baker played into this so he could assume a greater role as an explorer and co-discoverer of the Nile. Speke, via Baker's ship, then continued to Khartoum from which he sent a celebrated telegram to London: \"The Nile is settled.\"\nSpeke's expedition did not resolve the issue, however. Burton claimed that because Speke had not followed the Nile from the place it flowed out of Lake Victoria to Gondokoro, he could not be sure they were the same river.\nBaker and Florence, meanwhile, stayed in Gondokoro and tried to settle the flow of the river from there to Lake Victoria by traveling south. They eventually, after tremendous hardships, such as being wracked by fevers and held up by rulers for months on end, found Lake Albert and the Murchison Falls.\nReturn to London and third expedition.\nSpeke and Grant now returned to England, where they arrived in June 1863 and were welcomed as genuine heroes. This did not last long in Speke's case however; disputes with Burton, who was relentless in his criticisms and a very compelling public speaker and gifted writer, left Speke's discoveries in less than an ideal light. Speke had also committed to write a book for John Blackwood which he found hard and time-consuming as he was not naturally a gifted writer. He failed to give a good and full report to the RGS for many months and thus in effect was not defending his positions of discovery. In addition Speke had a public dispute with the Pethericks who had by and large acted according to their RGS instructions but Speke had felt they had not. \nAll this led Roderick Murchison, president of the Royal Geographical Society, to start disliking Speke and a third expedition, led by Speke, was becoming less likely as it would have to be funded by the people Speke was now not on good terms with. It appears that just as Burton had overplayed his hand after the first trip Speke now did the same. Now the RGS asked that a public debate should be held between Speke and Burton to try and settle the Nile's source.\nDeath.\nA debate was planned between Speke and Burton before the geographical section of the British Association in Bath on 16 September 1864, but Speke had died the previous afternoon from a possibly self-inflicted gunshot wound while shooting at Neston Park in Wiltshire. A contemporary account of the events surrounding his death appeared in \"The Times\":\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;At about 2.30 p.m. on the same day [15 September 1864] Speke set out from his uncle's house in company with his cousin, George Fuller, and a gamekeeper, Daniel Davis, for an afternoon's shooting in Neston Park. He fired both barrels in the course of the afternoon and about 4 p.m. Davis was marking birds for the two guns who were about 60 yards apart. Speke was seen to climb onto a stone wall about 2 feet high: for the moment he was without his gun. A few seconds later there was a report and when George Fuller rushed up Speke's gun was found behind the wall in the field into which Speke had jumped. The right barrel was at half-cock: only the left barrel was discharged. Speke who was bleeding seriously was sensible for a few minutes and said feebly, \"Don't move me.\" George Fuller went for assistance leaving Davis to attend him; but Speke survived for only about 15 minutes, and when Mr. Snow, surgeon of Box, arrived he was already dead. There was a single wound in his left side such as would be made by a cartridge if the muzzle of the gun\u2014a Lancaster breech-loader without a safety guard\u2014were close to the body; the charge had passed upwards through the lungs dividing all the large blood vessels over the heart, though missing the heart itself.\nAn inquest concluded that the death was accidental, a conclusion supported by his only biographer Alexander Maitland, though the idea of suicide has appealed to some. Bearing in mind, however, that the fatal wound was just below Speke's armpit, suicide seems most unlikely. Burton, however, could not set aside his own strong dislike of Speke and was vocal in spreading the idea of a suicide, claiming that Speke feared the debate. Speke was buried in St Andrew's Church, Dowlish Wake in Somerset, five miles away from the ancestral home of the Speke family.\nSource of the Nile is settled, 1874\u20131877.\nIn 1874\u20131877, Henry Stanley mounted a new expedition and took a boat along the entire shore of Lake Victoria; he established that Lake Tanganyika and the Nile were not connected in any way, and he explored the headwaters of Lake Edward. It was now proven that Speke had been right all along, and that the Nile flowed from Lake Victoria via Ripon Falls and Murchison Falls to Lake Albert and from there to Gondokoro.\nAccording to other theories, the source of the White Nile, even after centuries of exploration, remains in dispute. The most remote source that is indisputably a source for the White Nile is the Kagera River, which was explored by German explorer Oscar Baumann, and geographically determined in 1937 by Burkhart Waldecker; however, the Kagera has tributaries that are in contention for the farthest source of the White Nile.\nScientific works.\nMuch of Speke's \"Journal of the Discovery of the Source of the Nile\" is a description of the physical features of Africa's races, in whose condition he found \"a strikingly existing proof of the Holy Scriptures.\" Living alongside the locals, Speke claimed to have found a \"superior race\" of \"men who were as unlike as they could be from the common order of the natives\" due to their \"fine oval faces, large eyes, and high noses, denoting the best blood of Abyssinia\" \u2013; that is, Ethiopia. This \"race\" comprised many tribes, including the Watusi (Tutsi). Speke described their physical appearances as having retained\u00a0\u2013 despite the hair-curling and skin-darkening effects of intermarriage\u00a0\u2013 \"a high stamp of Asiatic feature, of which a marked characteristic is a bridged instead of bridgeless nose\".\nLegacy.\nEponyms.\nTwo species of African reptiles are named in his honour: Speke's hinge-back tortoise, \"Kinixys spekii\"; and Speke's sand lizard, \"Heliobolus spekii\". Three species of African mammals are named in his honour: the sitatunga, \"Tragelaphus spekii\"; Speke's gazelle, \"Gazella spekei\"; and Speke's pectinator, \"Pectinator spekei\". Some streets and avenues in South Africa and Zimbabwe were named after him. The bar at the five-star Sonesta hotel in Nasr City, Cairo, was named after him when it opened in 1982; the then-manager came from the same town as Speke.\nFiction.\nWilliam Boyd presents a portrait of Speke in a fictional reimagining of the search for the source of the Nile in his 2022 novel, \"The Romantic\".\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

If only two terminals are used, one end and the wiper, it acts as a variable resistor or rheostat.\nThe measuring instrument called a potentiometer is essentially a voltage divider used for measuring electric potential (voltage); the component is an implementation of the same principle, hence its name.\nPotentiometers are commonly used to control electrical devices such as volume controls on audio equipment. It is also used in speed control of fans. Potentiometers operated by a mechanism can be used as position transducers, for example, in a joystick. Potentiometers are rarely used to directly control significant power (more than a watt), since the power dissipated in the potentiometer would be comparable to the power in the controlled load.\nNomenclature.\nSome terms in the electronics industry used to describe certain types of potentiometers are:\nConstruction.\nPotentiometers consist of a resistive element, a sliding contact (wiper) that moves along the element, making good electrical contact with one part of it, electrical terminals at each end of the element, a mechanism that moves the wiper from one end to the other, and a housing containing the element and wiper.\nMany inexpensive potentiometers are constructed with a resistive element (B in cutaway drawing) formed into an arc of a circle usually a little less than a full turn and a wiper (C) sliding on this element when rotated, making electrical contact. The resistive element can be flat or angled. Each end of the resistive element is connected to a terminal (E, G) on the case. The wiper is connected to a third terminal (F), usually between the other two. On panel potentiometers, the wiper is usually the center terminal of three. For single-turn potentiometers, this wiper typically travels just under one revolution around the contact. The only point of ingress for contamination is the narrow space between the shaft and the housing it rotates in.\nAnother type is the linear slider potentiometer, which has a wiper which slides along a linear element instead of rotating. Contamination can potentially enter anywhere along the slot the slider moves in, making effective sealing more difficult and compromising long-term reliability. An advantage of the slider potentiometer is that the slider position gives a visual indication of its setting. While the setting of a rotary potentiometer can be seen by the position of a marking on the knob, an array of sliders can give a visual impression of settings as in a graphic equalizer or faders on a mixing console.\nThe resistive element of inexpensive potentiometers is often made of graphite. Other materials used include resistance wire, carbon particles in plastic, and a ceramic/metal mixture called cermet.\nConductive track potentiometers use conductive polymer resistor pastes that contain hard-wearing resins and polymers, solvents, and lubricant, in addition to the carbon that provides the conductive properties.\nMultiturn potentiometers are also operated by rotating a shaft, but by several turns rather than less than a full turn. Some multiturn potentiometers have a linear resistive element with a sliding contact moved by a lead screw; others have a helical resistive element and a wiper that turns through 10, 20, or more complete revolutions, moving along the helix as it rotates. Multiturn potentiometers, both user-accessible and preset, allow finer adjustments; rotation through the same angle changes the setting by typically a tenth as much as for a simple rotary potentiometer.\nA string potentiometer is a multi-turn potentiometer operated by an attached reel of wire turning against a spring, allowing it to convert linear position to a variable resistance.\nUser-accessible rotary potentiometers can be fitted with a switch which operates usually at the anti-clockwise extreme of rotation. Before digital electronics became the norm such a component was used to allow radio and television receivers and other equipment to be switched on at minimum volume with an audible click, then the volume increased by turning the same knob. Multiple resistance elements can be ganged together with their sliding contacts on the same shaft, for example in stereo audio amplifiers for volume control. In other applications, such as domestic light dimmers, the normal usage pattern is best satisfied if the potentiometer remains set at its current position, so the switch is operated by a push action, alternately on and off, by axial presses of the knob.\nOther potentiometers are enclosed within the equipment and are intended to only be adjusted when calibrating the equipment during manufacture or repair, and not otherwise touched. They are usually physically much smaller than user-accessible potentiometers, and may need to be operated by a screwdriver rather than having a knob. They are usually called \"trimmer\", \"trim[ming]\", or \"preset\" potentiometers (or pots), or the genericized brand name \"trimpot\".\nResistance\u2013position relationship: \"taper\".\nThe relationship between slider position and resistance, known as the \"taper\" or \"law\", can be controlled during manufacture by changing the composition or thickness of the resistance coating along the resistance element. Although in principle any taper is possible, two types are widely manufactured: linear and logarithmic (aka \"audio taper\") potentiometers.\nA letter code may be used to identify which taper is used, but the letter code definitions are not standardized. Potentiometers made in Asia and the US are usually marked with an \"A\" for logarithmic taper or a \"B\" for linear taper; \"C\" for the rarely seen reverse logarithmic taper. Others, particularly those from Europe, may be marked with an \"A\" for linear taper, a \"C\" or \"B\" for logarithmic taper, or an \"F\" for reverse logarithmic taper. The code used also varies between different manufacturers. When a percentage is referenced with a non-linear taper, it relates to the resistance value at the midpoint of the shaft rotation. A 10% log taper would therefore measure 10% of the total resistance at the midpoint of the rotation; i.e. 10% log taper on a 10\u00a0kOhm potentiometer would yield 1\u00a0kOhm at the midpoint. The higher the percentage, the steeper the log curve.\nLinear taper potentiometer.\nA \"linear taper potentiometer\" (\"linear\" describes the electrical characteristic of the device, not the geometry of the resistive element) has a resistive element of constant cross-section, resulting in a device where the resistance between the contact (wiper) and one end terminal is proportional to the distance between them. Linear taper potentiometers are used when the division ratio of the potentiometer must be proportional to the angle of shaft rotation (or slider position), for example, controls used for adjusting the centering of the display on an analog cathode-ray oscilloscope. Precision potentiometers have an accurate relationship between resistance and slider position. \nLogarithmic potentiometer.\nA \"logarithmic taper potentiometer\" is a potentiometer that has a bias built into the resistive element, meaning the center position of the potentiometer is not one half of the total value of the potentiometer. The resistive element is designed to follow a logarithmic taper, aka a mathematical exponent or \"squared\" profile.\nA logarithmic taper potentiometer is constructed with a resistive element that either \"tapers\" in from one end to the other, or is made from a material whose resistivity varies from one end to the other. This results in a device where output voltage is a logarithmic function of the slider position.\nMost (cheaper) \"log\" potentiometers are not accurately logarithmic, but use two regions of different resistance (but constant resistivity) to approximate a logarithmic law. The two resistive tracks overlap at approximately 50% of the potentiometer rotation; this gives a stepwise logarithmic taper. A logarithmic potentiometer can also be simulated with a linear one and an external resistor. True logarithmic potentiometers are significantly more expensive.\nLogarithmic taper potentiometers are often used for volume or signal level in audio systems, as human perception of audio volume is logarithmic, according to the Weber\u2013Fechner law.\nContactless potentiometer.\nUnlike mechanical potentiometers, \"non-contact potentiometers\" use an optical disk to trigger an infrared sensor, or a magnet to trigger a magnetic sensor (as long as there are other types of sensors, such as capacitive, other types of non-contact potentiometers can probably be built), and then an electronic circuit does the signal processing to provide an output signal that can be analogue or digital.\nAn example of a non-contact potentiometer can be found with the https:// integrated circuit. However, absolute encoders must also use similar principles, although being for industrial use, certainly the cost must be unfeasible for use in domestic appliances.\nRheostat.\nThe most common way to vary the resistance in a circuit continuously is to use a rheostat. Because of the change in resistance, they can also be used to adjust magnitude of current in a circuit. The word \"rheostat\" was coined in 1843 by Sir Charles Wheatstone, from the Greek \"rheos\" meaning \"stream\", and - -\"states\" (from \"histanai\", \"to set, to cause to stand\") meaning \"setter, regulating device\", which is a two-terminal variable resistor. For low-power applications (less than about 1 watt) a three-terminal potentiometer is often used, with one terminal unconnected or connected to the wiper.\nWhere the rheostat must be rated for higher power (more than about 1 watt), it may be built with a resistance wire wound around a semi-circular insulator, with the wiper sliding from one turn of the wire to the next. Sometimes a rheostat is made from resistance wire wound on a heat-resisting cylinder, with the slider made from a number of metal fingers that grip lightly onto a small portion of the turns of resistance wire. The \"fingers\" can be moved along the coil of resistance wire by a sliding knob thus changing the \"tapping\" point. Wire-wound rheostats made with ratings up to several thousand watts are used in applications such as DC motor drives, electric welding controls, or in the controls for generators. The rating of the rheostat is given with the full resistance value and the allowable power dissipation is proportional to the fraction of the total device resistance in circuit. Carbon-pile rheostats are used as load banks for testing automobile batteries and power supplies.\nDigital potentiometer.\nA digital potentiometer (often called digipot) is an electronic component that mimics the functions of analog potentiometers. Through digital input signals, the resistance between two terminals can be adjusted, just as in an analog potentiometer. There are two main functional types: volatile, which lose their set position if power is removed, and are usually designed to initialise at the minimum position, and non-volatile, which retain their set position using a storage mechanism similar to flash memory or EEPROM.\nUsage of a digipot is far more complex than that of a simple mechanical potentiometer, and there are many limitations to observe; nevertheless they are widely used, often for factory adjustment and calibration of equipment, especially where the limitations of mechanical potentiometers are problematic. A digipot is generally immune to the effects of moderate long-term mechanical vibration or environmental contamination, to the same extent as other semiconductor devices, and can be secured electronically against unauthorised tampering by protecting the access to its programming inputs by various means.\nIn equipment which has a microprocessor, FPGA or other functional logic which can store settings and reload them to the \"potentiometer\" every time the equipment is powered up, a multiplying DAC can be used in place of a digipot, and this can offer higher setting resolution, less drift with temperature, and more operational flexibility.\nMembrane potentiometers.\nA membrane potentiometer uses a conductive membrane that is deformed by a sliding element to contact a resistor voltage divider. Linearity can range from 0.50% to 5% depending on the material, design and manufacturing process. The repeat accuracy is typically between 0.1\u00a0mm and 1.0\u00a0mm with a theoretically infinite resolution. The service life of these types of potentiometers is typically 1 million to 20 million cycles depending on the materials used during manufacturing and the actuation method; contact and contactless (magnetic) methods are available (to sense position). Many different material variations are available such as PET, FR4, and Kapton. Membrane potentiometer manufacturers offer linear, rotary, and application-specific variations. The linear versions can range from 9\u00a0mm to 1000\u00a0mm in length and the rotary versions range from 20 to 450\u00a0mm in diameter, with each having a height of 0.5\u00a0mm. Membrane potentiometers can be used for position sensing.\nFor touch-screen devices using resistive technology, a two-dimensional membrane potentiometer provides x and y coordinates. The top layer is thin glass spaced close to a neighboring inner layer. The underside of the top layer has a transparent conductive coating; the surface of the layer beneath it has a transparent resistive coating. A finger or stylus deforms the glass to contact the underlying layer. Edges of the resistive layer have conductive contacts.\nLocating the contact point is done by applying a voltage to opposite edges, leaving the other two edges temporarily unconnected. The voltage of the top layer provides one coordinate. Disconnecting those two edges, and applying voltage to the other two, formerly unconnected, provides the other coordinate. Alternating rapidly between pairs of edges provides frequent position updates. An analog-to-digital converter provides output data.\nAdvantages of such sensors are that only five connections to the sensor are needed, and the associated electronics is comparatively simple. Another is that any material that depresses the top layer over a small area works well. A disadvantage is that sufficient force must be applied to make contact. Another is that the sensor requires occasional calibration to match touch location to the underlying display. (Capacitive sensors require no calibration or contact force, only proximity of a finger or other conductive object. However, they are significantly more complex.)\nApplications.\nPotentiometers are rarely used to directly control significant amounts of power (more than a watt or so). Instead they are used to adjust the level of analog signals (for example volume controls audio equipment), and as control inputs for electronic circuits. For example, a light dimmer uses a potentiometer to control the switching of a TRIAC and so indirectly to control the brightness of lamps.\nPreset potentiometers are widely used throughout electronics wherever adjustments must be made during manufacturing or servicing.\nUser-actuated potentiometers are widely used as user controls, and may control a very wide variety of equipment functions. The widespread use of potentiometers in consumer electronics declined in the 1990s, with rotary incremental encoders, up/down push-buttons, and other digital controls now more common. However they remain in many applications, such as volume controls and as position sensors.\nAudio control.\nLow-power potentiometers, both slide and rotary, are used to control audio equipment, changing loudness, frequency attenuation, and other characteristics of audio signals.\nThe 'log pot', which is a potentiometer that has a resistance, taper, or, \"curve\" (or law) of a logarithmic (log) form, is used as the volume control in audio power amplifiers, where it is also called an \"audio taper pot\" because the amplitude response of the human ear is approximately logarithmic. It ensures that on a volume control marked 0 to 10, for example, a setting of 5 sounds subjectively half as loud as a setting of 10. There is also an \"anti-log pot\" or \"reverse audio taper\" which is simply the reverse of a logarithmic potentiometer. It is almost always used in a ganged configuration with a logarithmic potentiometer, for instance, in an audio balance control.\nPotentiometers used in combination with filter networks act as tone controls or equalizers.\nIn audio systems, the word linear is sometimes applied in a confusing way to describe slide potentiometers because of the straight line nature of the physical sliding motion. The word linear, when applied to a potentiometer regardless of being a slide or rotary type, describes a linear relationship of the pot's position versus the measured value of the pot's tap (wiper or electrical output) pin.\nTelevision.\nPotentiometers were formerly used to control picture brightness, contrast, and color response. A potentiometer was often used to adjust \"vertical hold\", which affected the synchronization between the receiver's internal sweep circuit (sometimes a multivibrator) and the received picture signal, along with other things such as audio-video carrier offset, tuning frequency (for push-button sets) and so on. It also helps in frequency modulation of waves.\nMotion control.\nPotentiometers can be used as position feedback devices in order to create closed-loop control, such as in a servomechanism. This method of motion control is the simplest method of measuring the angle or displacement.\nTransducers.\nPotentiometers are also very widely used as a part of displacement transducers because of the simplicity of construction and because they can give a large output signal.\nComputation.\nIn analog computers, high precision potentiometers are used to scale intermediate results by desired constant factors, or to set initial conditions for a calculation. A motor-driven potentiometer may be used as a function generator, using a non-linear resistance card to supply approximations to trigonometric functions. For example, the shaft rotation might represent an angle, and the voltage division ratio can be made proportional to the cosine of the angle.\nTheory of operation.\nThe potentiometer can be used as a voltage divider to obtain a manually adjustable output voltage at the slider (wiper) from a fixed input voltage applied across the two ends of the potentiometer. This is their most common use.\nThe voltage across \"R\"L can be calculated by:\nformula_1\nIf \"R\"L is large compared to the other resistances (like the input to an operational amplifier), the output voltage can be approximated by the simpler equation:\nformula_2\nAs an example, assume formula_3, formula_4, formula_5, and formula_6\nSince the load resistance is large compared to the other resistances, the output voltage \"V\"L will be approximately:\nformula_7\nBecause of the load resistance, however, it will actually be slightly lower: \u2248 6.623 \"V\".\nOne of the advantages of the potential divider compared to a variable resistor in series with the source is that, while variable resistors have a maximum resistance where some current will always flow, dividers are able to vary the output voltage from maximum (\"V\"S) to ground (zero volts) as the wiper moves from one end of the potentiometer to the other. There is, however, always a small amount of contact resistance.\nIn addition, the load resistance is often not known and therefore simply placing a variable resistor in series with the load could have a negligible effect or an excessive effect, depending on the load.\nFailure.\nAgeing may cause intermittent contact between the resistive track and the wiper as it is rotated. In volume control use this causes crackling.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Most electric motors operate through the interaction between the motor's magnetic field and electric current in a wire winding to generate Laplace force in the form of torque applied on the motor's shaft. An electric generator is mechanically identical to an electric motor, but operates in reverse, converting mechanical energy into electrical energy.\nElectric motors can be powered by direct current (DC) sources, such as from batteries or rectifiers, or by alternating current (AC) sources, such as a power grid, inverters or electrical generators. Electric motors may also be classified by considerations such as power source type, construction, application and type of motion output. They can be brushed or brushless, single-phase, two-phase, or three-phase, axial or radial flux, and may be air-cooled or liquid-cooled.\nStandardized electric motors provide power for industrial use. The largest are used for marine propulsion, pipeline compression and pumped-storage applications, with output exceeding 100 megawatts. Other applications include industrial fans, blowers and pumps, machine tools, household appliances, power tools, vehicles, and disk drives. Small motors may be found in electric watches. In certain applications, such as in regenerative braking with traction motors, electric motors can be used in reverse as generators to recover energy that might otherwise be lost as heat and friction.\nElectric motors produce linear or rotary force (torque) intended to propel some external mechanism. This makes them a type of actuator. They are generally designed for continuous rotation, or for linear movement over a significant distance compared to its size. Solenoids also convert electrical power to mechanical motion, but over only a limited distance.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nComponents.\nAn electric motor has two mechanical parts: the rotor, which moves, and the stator, which does not. Electrically, the motor consists of two parts, the field magnets and the armature, one of which is attached to the rotor and the other to the stator. Together they form a magnetic circuit. The magnets create a magnetic field that passes through the armature. These can be electromagnets or permanent magnets. The field magnet is usually on the stator and the armature on the rotor, but these may be reversed.\nRotor.\nThe rotor is the moving part that delivers the mechanical power. The rotor typically holds conductors that carry currents, on which the magnetic field of the stator exerts force to turn the shaft.\nStator.\nThe stator surrounds the rotor, and usually holds field magnets, which are either electromagnets (wire windings around a ferromagnetic iron core) or permanent magnets. These create a magnetic field that passes through the rotor armature, exerting force on the rotor windings. The stator core is made up of many thin metal sheets that are insulated from each other, called laminations. These laminations are made of electrical steel, which has a specified magnetic permeability, hysteresis, and saturation. Laminations reduce losses that would result from induced circulating eddy currents that would flow if a solid core were used. Mains powered AC motors typically immobilize the wires within the windings by impregnating them with varnish in a vacuum. This prevents the wires in the winding from vibrating against each other which would abrade the wire insulation and cause premature failures. Resin-packed motors, used in deep well submersible pumps, washing machines, and air conditioners, encapsulate the stator in plastic resin to prevent corrosion and/or reduce conducted noise.\nGap.\nAn air gap between the stator and rotor allows it to turn. The width of the gap has a significant effect on the motor's electrical characteristics. It is generally made as small as possible, as a large gap weakens performance. Conversely, gaps that are too small may create friction in addition to noise.\nArmature.\nThe armature consists of wire windings on a ferromagnetic core. Electric current passing through the wire causes the magnetic field to exert a force (Lorentz force) on it, turning the rotor. Windings are coiled wires, wrapped around a laminated, soft, iron, ferromagnetic core so as to form magnetic poles when energized with current.\nElectric machines come in salient- and nonsalient-pole configurations. In a salient-pole motor the rotor and stator ferromagnetic cores have projections called poles that face each other. Wire is wound around each pole below the pole face, which become north or south poles when current flows through the wire. In a nonsalient-pole (distributed field or round-rotor) motor, the ferromagnetic core is a smooth cylinder, with the windings distributed evenly in slots around the circumference. Supplying alternating current in the windings creates poles in the core that rotate continuously. A shaded-pole motor has a winding around part of the pole that delays the phase of the magnetic field for that pole.\nCommutator.\nA commutator is a rotary electrical switch that supplies current to the rotor. It periodically reverses the flow of current in the rotor windings as the shaft rotates. It consists of a cylinder composed of multiple metal contact segments on the armature. Two or more electrical contacts called \"brushes\" made of a soft conductive material like carbon press against the commutator. The brushes make sliding contact with successive commutator segments as the rotator turns, supplying current to the rotor. The windings on the rotor are connected to the commutator segments. The commutator reverses the current direction in the rotor windings with each half turn (180\u00b0), so the torque applied to the rotor is always in the same direction. Without this reversal, the direction of torque on each rotor winding would reverse with each half turn, stopping the rotor. Commutated motors have been mostly replaced by brushless motors, permanent magnet motors, and induction motors.\nShaft.\nThe motor shaft extends outside of the motor, where it satisfies the load. Because the forces of the load are exerted beyond the outermost bearing, the load is said to be overhung.\nBearings.\nThe rotor is supported by bearings, which allow the rotor to turn on its axis by transferring the force of axial and radial loads from the shaft to the motor housing.\nHistory.\nEarly motors.\nBefore modern electromagnetic motors, experimental motors that worked by electrostatic force were investigated. The first electric motors were simple electrostatic devices described in experiments by Scottish monk Andrew Gordon and American experimenter Benjamin Franklin in the 1740s and 1750s. The theoretical principle behind them, Coulomb's law, was discovered but not published, by Henry Cavendish in 1771. This law was discovered independently by Charles-Augustin de Coulomb in 1785, who published it so that it is now known by his name. Due to the difficulty of generating the high voltages they required, electrostatic motors were never used for practical purposes.\nThe invention of the electrochemical battery by Alessandro Volta in 1799 made the production of persistent electric currents possible. Hans Christian \u00d8rsted discovered in 1820 that an electric current creates a magnetic field, which can exert a force on a magnet. It only took a few weeks for Andr\u00e9-Marie Amp\u00e8re to develop the first formulation of the electromagnetic interaction and present the Amp\u00e8re's force law, that described the production of mechanical force by the interaction of an electric current and a magnetic field.\nMichael Faraday gave the first demonstration of the effect with a rotary motion on 3 September 1821 in the basement of the Royal Institution. A free-hanging wire was dipped into a pool of mercury, on which a permanent magnet (PM) was placed. When a current was passed through the wire, the wire rotated around the magnet, showing that the current gave rise to a close circular magnetic field around the wire. Faraday published the results of his discovery in the \"Quarterly Journal of Science\", and sent copies of his paper along with pocket-sized models of his device to colleagues around the world so they could also witness the phenomenon of electromagnetic rotations. This motor is often demonstrated in physics experiments, substituting brine for (toxic) mercury. Barlow's wheel was an early refinement to this Faraday demonstration, although these and similar homopolar motors remained unsuited to practical application until late in the century.\nIn 1827, Hungarian physicist \u00c1nyos Jedlik started experimenting with electromagnetic coils. After Jedlik solved the technical problems of continuous rotation with the invention of the commutator, he called his early devices \"electromagnetic self-rotors\". Although they were used only for teaching, in 1828 Jedlik demonstrated the first device to contain the three main components of practical DC motors: the stator, rotor and commutator. The device employed no permanent magnets, as the magnetic fields of both the stationary and revolving components were produced solely by the currents flowing through their windings.\nDC motors.\nThe first commutator &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Visible anchor/styles.css\" /&gt;DC electric motor capable of turning machinery was invented by English scientist William Sturgeon in 1832. Following Sturgeon's work, a commutator-type direct-current electric motor was built by American inventors Thomas Davenport and Emily Davenport, which he patented in 1837. The motors ran at up to 600 revolutions per minute, and powered machine tools and a printing press. Due to the high cost of primary battery power, the motors were commercially unsuccessful and bankrupted the Davenports. Several inventors followed Sturgeon in the development of DC motors, but all encountered the same battery cost issues. As no electricity distribution system was available at the time, no practical commercial market emerged for these motors.\nAfter many other more or less successful attempts with relatively weak rotating and reciprocating apparatus German-Russian Moritz von Jacobi created the first real useful rotating electric motor in May 1834. It developed remarkable mechanical output power. His motor set a world record, which Jacobi improved four years later in September 1838. His second motor was powerful enough to drive an electric boat with 14 people across a wide river. It was also in 1839\u20131840 that other developers managed to build motors with similar and then higher performance.\nIn 1827\u20131828, Jedlik built a device using similar principles to those used in his electromagnetic self-rotors that was capable of useful work. He built a model electric vehicle that same year.\nA major turning point came in 1864, when Antonio Pacinotti first described the ring armature (although initially conceived in a DC generator, i.e. a dynamo). This featured symmetrically grouped coils closed upon themselves and connected to the bars of a commutator, the brushes of which delivered practically non-fluctuating current. The first commercially successful DC motors followed the developments by Z\u00e9nobe Gramme who, in 1871, reinvented Pacinotti's design and adopted some solutions by Werner Siemens.\nA benefit to DC machines came from the discovery of the reversibility of the electric machine, which was announced by Siemens in 1867 and observed by Pacinotti in 1869. Gramme accidentally demonstrated it on the occasion of the , when he connected two such DC devices up to 2\u00a0km from each other, using one of them as a generator and the other as motor.\nThe drum rotor was introduced by Friedrich von Hefner-Alteneck of Siemens &amp; Halske to replace Pacinotti's ring armature in 1872, thus improving the machine efficiency. The laminated rotor was introduced by Siemens &amp; Halske the following year, achieving reduced iron losses and increased induced voltages. In 1880, Jonas Wenstr\u00f6m provided the rotor with slots for housing the winding, further increasing the efficiency.\nIn 1886, Frank Julian Sprague invented the first practical DC motor, a non-sparking device that maintained relatively constant speed under variable loads. Other Sprague electric inventions about this time greatly improved grid electric distribution (prior work done while employed by Thomas Edison), allowed power from electric motors to be returned to the electric grid, provided for electric distribution to trolleys via overhead wires and the trolley pole, and provided control systems for electric operations. This allowed Sprague to use electric motors to invent the first electric trolley system in 1887\u201388 in Richmond, Virginia, the electric elevator and control system in 1892, and the electric subway with independently powered centrally controlled cars. The latter were first installed in 1892 in Chicago by the South Side Elevated Railroad, where it became popularly known as the \"L\". Sprague's motor and related inventions led to an explosion of interest and use in electric motors for industry. The development of electric motors of acceptable efficiency was delayed for several decades by failure to recognize the extreme importance of an air gap between the rotor and stator. Efficient designs have a comparatively small air gap. The St. Louis motor, long used in classrooms to illustrate motor principles, is inefficient for the same reason, as well as appearing nothing like a modern motor.\nElectric motors revolutionized industry. Industrial processes were no longer limited by power transmission using line shafts, belts, compressed air or hydraulic pressure. Instead, every machine could be equipped with its own power source, providing easy control at the point of use, and improving power transmission efficiency. Electric motors applied in agriculture eliminated human and animal muscle power from such tasks as handling grain or pumping water. Household uses (such as washing machines, dishwashers, fans, air conditioners and refrigerators) of electric motors reduced heavy labor in the home and made higher standards of convenience, comfort and safety possible. Today, electric motors consume more than half of the electric energy produced in the US.\nAC motors.\nIn 1824, French physicist Fran\u00e7ois Arago formulated the existence of rotating magnetic fields, termed Arago's rotations, which, by manually turning switches on and off, Walter Baily demonstrated in 1879 as in effect the first primitive induction motor. In the 1880s many inventors were trying to develop workable AC motors because AC's advantages in long-distance high-voltage transmission were offset by the inability to operate motors on AC.\nThe first alternating-current commutatorless induction motor was invented by Galileo Ferraris in 1885. Ferraris was able to improve his first design by producing more advanced setups in 1886. In 1888, the \"Royal Academy of Science of Turin\" published Ferraris's research detailing the foundations of motor operation, while concluding at that time that \"the apparatus based on that principle could not be of any commercial importance as motor.\"\nPossible industrial development was envisioned by Nikola Tesla, who invented independently his induction motor in 1887 and obtained a patent in May 1888. In the same year, Tesla presented his paper \"A New System of Alternate Current Motors and Transformers\" to the AIEE that described three patented two-phase four-stator-pole motor types: one with a four-pole rotor forming a non-self-starting reluctance motor, another with a wound rotor forming a self-starting induction motor, and the third a true synchronous motor with separately excited DC supply to rotor winding. One of the patents Tesla filed in 1887, however, also described a shorted-winding-rotor induction motor. George Westinghouse, who had already acquired rights from Ferraris (US$1,000), promptly bought Tesla's patents (US$60,000 plus US$2.50 per sold hp, paid until 1897), employed Tesla to develop his motors, and assigned C.F. Scott to help Tesla; however, Tesla left for other pursuits in 1889. The constant speed AC induction motor was found not to be suitable for street cars, but Westinghouse engineers successfully adapted it to power a mining operation in Telluride, Colorado in 1891. Westinghouse achieved its first practical induction motor in 1892 and developed a line of polyphase 60 hertz induction motors in 1893, but these early Westinghouse motors were two-phase motors with wound rotors. B.G. Lamme later developed a rotating bar winding rotor.\nSteadfast in his promotion of three-phase development, Mikhail Dolivo-Dobrovolsky invented the three-phase induction motor in 1889, of both types cage-rotor and wound rotor with a starting rheostat, and the three-limb transformer in 1890. After an agreement between AEG and Maschinenfabrik Oerlikon, Doliwo-Dobrowolski and Charles Eugene Lancelot Brown developed larger models, namely a 20-hp squirrel cage and a 100-hp wound rotor with a starting rheostat. These were the first three-phase asynchronous motors suitable for practical operation. Since 1889, similar developments of three-phase machinery were started Wenstr\u00f6m. At the 1891 Frankfurt International Electrotechnical Exhibition, the first long distance three-phase system was successfully presented. It was rated 15 kV and extended over 175\u00a0km from the Lauffen waterfall on the Neckar river. The Lauffen power station included a 240\u00a0kW 86 V 40\u00a0Hz alternator and a step-up transformer while at the exhibition a step-down transformer fed a 100-hp three-phase induction motor that powered an artificial waterfall, representing the transfer of the original power source. The three-phase induction is now used for the vast majority of commercial applications. Mikhail Dolivo-Dobrovolsky claimed that Tesla's motor was not practical because of two-phase pulsations, which prompted him to persist in his three-phase work.\nThe General Electric Company began developing three-phase induction motors in 1891. By 1896, General Electric and Westinghouse signed a cross-licensing agreement for the bar-winding-rotor design, later called the squirrel-cage rotor. Induction motor improvements flowing from these inventions and innovations were such that a 100-horsepower induction motor currently has the same mounting dimensions as a 7.5-horsepower motor in 1897.\nTwenty-first century.\nIn 2022, electric motor sales were estimated to be 800 million units, increasing by 10% annually. Electric motors consume \u224850% of the world's electricity. Since the 1980s, the market share of DC motors has declined in favor of AC motors.89\nInputs.\nPower supply.\nA DC motor is usually supplied through a split ring commutator as described above.\nAC motors' commutation can be achieved using either a slip ring commutator or external commutation. It can be fixed-speed or variable-speed control type, and can be synchronous or asynchronous. Universal motors can run on either AC or DC.\nControl.\nDC motors can be operated at variable speeds by adjusting the voltage applied to the terminals or by using pulse-width modulation (PWM).\nAC motors operated at a fixed speed are generally powered directly from the grid or through motor soft starters.\nAC motors operated at variable speeds are powered with various power inverter, variable-frequency drive or electronic commutator technologies.\nThe term electronic commutator is usually associated with self-commutated brushless DC motor and switched reluctance motor applications.\nTypes.\nElectric motors operate on one of three physical principles: magnetism, electrostatics and piezoelectricity.\nIn magnetic motors, magnetic fields are formed in both the rotor and the stator. The product between these two fields gives rise to a force and thus a torque on the motor shaft. One or both of these fields changes as the rotor turns. This is done by switching the poles on and off at the right time, or varying the strength of the pole.\nMotors can be designed to operate on DC current, on AC current, or some types can work on either. \nAC motors can be either asynchronous or synchronous. Synchronous motors require the rotor to turn at the same speed as the stator's rotating field. Asynchronous rotors relax this constraint.\nA fractional-horsepower motor either has a rating below about 1 horsepower (0.746\u00a0kW), or is manufactured with a frame size smaller than a standard 1 HP motor. Many household and industrial motors are in the fractional-horsepower class.\nNotes:\n1. Rotation is independent of the frequency of the AC voltage.\n2. Rotation is equal to synchronous speed (motor-stator-field speed).\n3. In SCIM, fixed-speed operation rotation is equal to synchronous speed, less slip speed.\n4. In non-slip energy-recovery systems, WRIM is usually used for motor-starting but can be used to vary load speed.\n5. Variable-speed operation.\n6. Whereas induction- and synchronous-motor drives are typically with either six-step or sinusoidal-waveform output, BLDC-motor drives are usually with trapezoidal-current waveform; the behavior of both sinusoidal and trapezoidal PM machines is, however, identical in terms of their fundamental aspects.\n7. In variable-speed operation, WRIM is used in slip-energy recovery and double-fed induction-machine applications.\n8. A cage winding is a short-circuited squirrel-cage rotor, a wound winding is connected externally through slip rings.\n9. Mostly single-phase with some three-phase.\nAbbreviations:\nSelf-commutated motor.\nBrushed DC motor.\nMost DC motors are small permanent magnet (PM) types. They contain a brushed internal mechanical commutation to reverse motor windings' current in synchronism with rotation.\nElectrically excited DC motor.\nA commutated DC motor has a set of rotating windings wound on an armature mounted on a rotating shaft. The shaft also carries the commutator. Thus, every brushed DC motor has AC flowing through its windings. Current flows through one or more pairs of brushes that touch the commutator; the brushes connect an external source of electric power to the rotating armature.\nThe rotating armature consists of one or more wire coils wound around a laminated, magnetically \"soft\" ferromagnetic core. Current from the brushes flows through the commutator and one winding of the armature, making it a temporary magnet (an electromagnet). The magnetic field produced interacts with a stationary magnetic field produced by either PMs or another winding (a field coil), as part of the motor frame. The force between the two magnetic fields rotates the shaft. The commutator switches power to the coils as the rotor turns, keeping the poles from ever fully aligning with the magnetic poles of the stator field, so that the rotor keeps turning as long as power is applied.\nMany of the limitations of the classic commutator DC motor are due to the need for brushes to maintain contact with the commutator, creating friction. The brushes create sparks while crossing the insulating gaps between commutator sections. Depending on the commutator design, the brushes may create short circuits between adjacent sections\u2014and hence coil ends. Furthermore, the rotor coils' inductance causes the voltage across each to rise when its circuit opens, increasing the sparking. This sparking limits the maximum speed of the machine, as too-rapid sparking will overheat, erode, or even melt the commutator. The current density per unit area of the brushes, in combination with their resistivity, limits the motor's output. Crossing the gaps also generates electrical noise; sparking generates RFI. Brushes eventually wear out and require replacement, and the commutator itself is subject to wear and maintenance or replacement. The commutator assembly on a large motor is a costly element, requiring precision assembly of many parts. On small motors, the commutator is usually permanently integrated into the rotor, so replacing it usually requires replacing the rotor.\nWhile most commutators are cylindrical, some are flat, segmented discs mounted on an insulator.\nLarge brushes create a large contact area, which maximizes motor output, while small brushes have low mass to maximize the speed at which the motor can run without excessive sparking. (Small brushes are desirable for their lower cost.) Stiffer brush springs can be used to make brushes of a given mass work at a higher speed, despite greater friction losses (lower efficiency) and accelerated brush and commutator wear. Therefore, DC motor brush design entails a trade-off between output power, speed, and efficiency/wear.\nDC machines are defined as follows:\nThe five types of brushed DC motor are:\nPermanent magnet.\nA permanent magnet (PM) motor does not have a field winding on the stator frame, relying instead on PMs to provide the magnetic field. Compensating windings in series with the armature may be used on large motors to improve commutation under load. This field is fixed and cannot be adjusted for speed control. PM fields (stators) are convenient in miniature motors to eliminate the power consumption of the field winding. Most larger DC motors are of the \"dynamo\" type, which have stator windings. Historically, PMs could not be made to retain high flux if they were disassembled; field windings were more practical to obtain the needed flux. However, large PMs are costly, as well as dangerous and difficult to assemble; this favors wound fields for large machines.\nTo minimize overall weight and size, miniature PM motors may use high energy magnets made with neodymium; most are neodymium-iron-boron alloy. With their higher flux density, electric machines with high-energy PMs are at least competitive with all optimally designed singly-fed synchronous and induction electric machines. Miniature motors resemble the structure in the illustration, except that they have at least three rotor poles (to ensure starting, regardless of rotor position) and their outer housing is a steel tube that magnetically links the exteriors of the curved field magnets.\nElectronic commutator (EC).\nBrushless DC.\nSome of the problems of the brushed DC motor are eliminated in the BLDC design. In this motor, the mechanical \"rotating switch\" or commutator is replaced by an external electronic switch synchronised to the rotor's position. BLDC motors are typically 85%+ efficient, reaching up to 96.5%, while brushed DC motors are typically 75\u201380% efficient.\nThe BLDC motor's characteristic trapezoidal counter-electromotive force (CEMF) waveform is derived partly from the stator windings being evenly distributed, and partly from the placement of the rotor's permanent magnets. Also known as electronically commutated DC or inside-out DC motors, the stator windings of trapezoidal BLDC motors can be single-phase, two-phase or three-phase and use Hall effect sensors mounted on their windings for rotor position sensing and low cost closed-loop commutator control.\nBLDC motors are commonly used where precise speed control is necessary, as in computer disk drives or video cassette recorders. The spindles within CD, CD-ROM (etc.) drives, and mechanisms within office products, such as fans, laser printers and photocopiers. They have several advantages over conventional motors:\nModern BLDC motors range in power from a fraction of a watt to many kilowatts. Larger BLDC motors rated up to about 100\u00a0kW are used in electric vehicles. They also find use in electric model aircraft.\nSwitched reluctance motor.\nThe switched reluctance motor (SRM) has no brushes or permanent magnets, and the rotor has no electric currents. Torque comes from a slight misalignment of poles on the rotor with poles on the stator. The rotor aligns itself with the magnetic field of the stator, while the stator field windings are sequentially energized to rotate the stator field.\nThe magnetic flux created by the field windings follows the path of least magnetic sending the flux through rotor poles that are closest to the energized poles of the stator, thereby magnetizing those poles of the rotor and creating torque. As the rotor turns, different windings are energized, keeping the rotor turning.\nSRMs are used in some appliances and vehicles.\nUniversal AC/DC motor.\nA commutated, electrically excited, series or parallel wound motor is referred to as a universal motor because it can be designed to operate on either AC or DC power. A universal motor can operate well on AC because the current in both the field and the armature coils (and hence the resultant magnetic fields) synchronously reverse polarity, and hence the resulting mechanical force occurs in a constant direction of rotation.\nOperating at normal power line frequencies, universal motors are often used in sub-kilowatt applications. Universal motors formed the basis of the traditional railway traction motor in electric railways. In this application, using AC power on a motor designed to run on DC would experience efficiency losses due to eddy current heating of their magnetic components, particularly the motor field pole-pieces that, for DC, would have used solid (un-laminated) iron. They are now rarely used.\nAn advantage is that AC power may be used on motors that specifically have high starting torque and compact design if high running speeds are used. By contrast, maintenance is higher and lifetimes are shortened. Such motors are used in devices that are not heavily used, and have high starting-torque demands. Multiple taps on the field coil provide (imprecise) stepped speed control. Household blenders that advertise many speeds typically combine a field coil with several taps and a diode that can be inserted in series with the motor (causing the motor to run on half-wave rectified AC). Universal motors also lend themselves to electronic speed control and, as such, are a choice for devices such as domestic washing machines. The motor can agitate the drum (both forwards and in reverse) by switching the field winding with respect to the armature.\nWhereas SCIMs cannot turn a shaft faster than allowed by the power line frequency, universal motors can run at much higher speeds. This makes them useful for appliances such as blenders, vacuum cleaners, and hair dryers where high speed and light weight are desirable. They are also commonly used in portable power tools, such as drills, sanders, circular and jig saws, where the motor's characteristics work well. Many vacuum cleaner and weed trimmer motors exceed 10,000 rpm, while miniature grinders may exceed 30,000 rpm.\nExternally commutated AC machine.\nAC induction and synchronous motors are optimized for operation on single-phase or polyphase sinusoidal or quasi-sinusoidal waveform power such as supplied for fixed-speed applications by the AC power grid or for variable-speed application from variable-frequency drive (VFD) controllers.\nInduction motor.\nAn induction motor is an asynchronous AC motor where power is transferred to the rotor by electromagnetic induction, much like transformer action. An induction motor resembles a rotating transformer, because the stator (stationary part) is essentially the primary side of the transformer and the rotor (rotating part) is the secondary side. Polyphase induction motors are widely used in industry.\nCage and wound rotor.\nInduction motors may be divided into Squirrel Cage Induction Motors (SCIM) and Wound Rotor Induction Motors (WRIM). SCIMs have a heavy winding made up of solid bars, usually aluminum or copper, electrically connected by rings at the ends of the rotor. The bars and rings as a whole are much like an animal's rotating exercise cage.\nCurrents induced into this winding provide the rotor magnetic field. The shape of the rotor bars determines the speed-torque characteristics. At low speeds, the current induced in the squirrel cage is nearly at line frequency and tends to stay in the outer parts of the cage. As the motor accelerates, the slip frequency becomes lower, and more current reaches the interior. By shaping the bars to change the resistance of the winding portions in the interior and outer parts of the cage, a variable resistance is effectively inserted in the rotor circuit. However, most such motors employ uniform bars.\nIn a WRIM, the rotor winding is made of many turns of insulated wire and is connected to slip rings on the motor shaft. An external resistor or other control device can be connected in the rotor circuit. Resistors allow control of the motor speed, although dissipating significant power. A converter can be fed from the rotor circuit and return the slip-frequency power that would otherwise be wasted into the power system through an inverter or separate motor-generator.\nWRIMs are used primarily to start a high inertia load or a load that requires high starting torque across the full speed range. By correctly selecting the resistors used in the secondary resistance or slip ring starter, the motor is able to produce maximum torque at a relatively low supply current from zero speed to full speed.\nMotor speed can be changed because the motor's torque curve is effectively modified by the amount of resistance connected to the rotor circuit. Increasing resistance lowers the speed of maximum torque. If the resistance is increased beyond the point where the maximum torque occurs at zero speed, the torque is further reduced.\nWhen used with a load that has a torque curve that increases with speed, the motor operates at the speed where the torque developed by the motor is equal to the load torque. Reducing the load causes the motor to speed up, while increasing the load causes the motor to slow down until the load and motor torque are again equal. Operated in this manner, the slip losses are dissipated in the secondary resistors and can be significant. The speed regulation and net efficiency is poor.\nTorque motor.\nA torque motor can operate indefinitely while stalled, that is, with the rotor blocked from turning, without incurring damage. In this mode of operation, the motor applies a steady torque to the load.\nA common application is the supply- and take-up reel motors in a tape drive. In this application, driven by a low voltage, the characteristics of these motors apply a steady light tension to the tape whether or not the capstan is feeding tape past the tape heads. Driven from a higher voltage (delivering a higher torque), torque motors can achieve fast-forward and rewind operation without requiring additional mechanics such as gears or clutches. In the computer gaming world, torque motors are used in force feedback steering wheels.\nAnother common application is to control the throttle of an internal combustion engine with an electronic governor. The motor works against a return spring to move the throttle in accord with the governor output. The latter monitors engine speed by counting electrical pulses from the ignition system or from a magnetic pickup and depending on the speed, makes small adjustments to the amount of current. If the engine slows down relative to the desired speed, the current increases, producing more torque, pulling against the return spring and opening the throttle. Should the engine run too fast, the governor reduces the current, allowing the return spring to pull back and reduce the throttle.\nSynchronous motor.\nA synchronous electric motor is an AC motor. It includes a rotor spinning with coils passing magnets at the same frequency as the AC and produces a magnetic field to drive it. It has zero slip under typical operating conditions. By contrast induction motors must slip to produce torque. One type of synchronous motor is like an induction motor except that the rotor is excited by a DC field. Slip rings and brushes conduct current to the rotor. The rotor poles connect to each other and move at the same speed. Another type, for low load torque, has flats ground onto a conventional squirrel-cage rotor to create discrete poles. Yet another, as made by Hammond for its pre-World War II clocks, and in older Hammond organs, has no rotor windings and discrete poles. It is not self-starting. The clock requires manual starting by a small knob on the back, while the older Hammond organs had an auxiliary starting motor connected by a spring-loaded manually operated switch.\nHysteresis synchronous motors typically are (essentially) two-phase motors with a phase-shifting capacitor for one phase. They start like induction motors, but when slip rate decreases sufficiently, the rotor (a smooth cylinder) becomes temporarily magnetized. Its distributed poles make it act like a permanent magnet synchronous motor. The rotor material, like that of a common nail, stays magnetized, but can be demagnetized with little difficulty. Once running, the rotor poles stay in place; they do not drift.\nLow-power synchronous timing motors (such as those for traditional electric clocks) may have multi-pole permanent magnet external cup rotors, and use shading coils to provide starting torque. \"Telechron\" clock motors have shaded poles for starting torque, and a two-spoke ring rotor that performs like a discrete two-pole rotor.\nDoubly-fed electric machine.\nDoubly fed electric motors have two independent multiphase winding sets, which contribute active (i.e., working) power to the energy conversion process, with at least one of the winding sets electronically controlled for variable speed operation. Two independent multiphase winding sets (i.e., dual armature) are the maximum provided in a single package without topology duplication. Doubly fed electric motors have an effective constant torque speed range that is twice synchronous speed for a given frequency of excitation. This is twice the constant torque speed range as singly-fed electric machines, which have only one active winding set.\nA doubly fed motor allows for a smaller electronic converter but the cost of the rotor winding and slip rings may offset the saving in the power electronics components. Difficulties affect controlling speed near synchronous speed limit applications.\nAdvanced types.\nRotary.\nIronless or coreless rotor motor.\nThe coreless or ironless DC motor is a specialized permanent magnet DC motor. Optimized for rapid acceleration, the rotor is constructed without an iron core. The rotor can take the form of a winding-filled cylinder, or a self-supporting structure comprising only wire and bonding material. The rotor can fit inside the stator magnets; a magnetically soft stationary cylinder inside the rotor provides a return path for the stator magnetic flux. A second arrangement has the rotor winding basket surrounding the stator magnets. In that design, the rotor fits inside a magnetically soft cylinder that can serve as the motor housing, and provides a return path for the flux.\nBecause the rotor is much lower in mass compared to a conventional rotor, it can accelerate much more rapidly, often achieving a mechanical time constant under one millisecond. This is especially true if the windings use aluminum rather than (heavier) copper. The rotor has no metal mass to act as a heat sink; even small motors must be cooled. Overheating can be an issue for these designs.\nThe vibrating alert of cellular phones can be generated by cylindrical permanent-magnet motors, or disc-shaped types that have a thin multipolar disc field magnet, and an intentionally unbalanced molded-plastic rotor structure with two bonded coreless coils. Metal brushes and a flat commutator switch power to the rotor coils.\nRelated limited-travel actuators have no core and a bonded coil placed between the poles of high-flux thin permanent magnets. These are the fast head positioners for rigid-disk (\"hard disk\") drives. Although the contemporary design differs considerably from that of loudspeakers, it is still loosely (and incorrectly) referred to as a \"voice coil\" structure, because some earlier rigid-disk-drive heads moved in straight lines, and had a drive structure much like that of a loudspeaker.\nPancake or axial rotor motor.\nThe printed armature or pancake motor has windings shaped as a disc running between arrays of high-flux magnets. The magnets are arranged in a circle facing the rotor spaced to form an axial air gap. This design is commonly known as the pancake motor because of its flat profile.\nThe armature (originally formed on a printed circuit board) is made from punched copper sheets that are laminated together using advanced composites to form a thin, rigid disc. The armature does not have a separate ring commutator. The brushes move directly on the armature surface making the whole design compact.\nAn alternative design is to use wound copper wire laid flat with a central conventional commutator, in a flower and petal shape. The windings are typically stabilized with electrical epoxy potting systems. These are filled epoxies that have moderate, mixed viscosity and a long gel time. They are highlighted by low shrinkage and low exotherm, and are typically UL 1446 recognized as a potting compound insulated with , Class H rating.\nThe unique advantage of ironless DC motors is the absence of cogging (torque variations caused by changing attraction between the iron and the magnets). Parasitic eddy currents cannot form in the rotor as it is totally ironless, although iron rotors are laminated. This can greatly improve efficiency, but variable-speed controllers must use a higher switching rate (&gt;40\u00a0kHz) or DC because of decreased electromagnetic induction.\nThese motors were invented to drive the capstan(s) of magnetic tape drives, where minimal time to reach operating speed and minimal stopping distance were critical. Pancake motors are widely used in high-performance servo-controlled systems, robotic systems, industrial automation and medical devices. Due to the variety of constructions now available, the technology is used in applications from high temperature military to low cost pump and basic servos.\nAnother approach (Magnax) is to use a single stator sandwiched between two rotors. One such design has produced peak power of 15\u00a0kW/kg, sustained power around 7.5\u00a0kW/kg. This yokeless axial flux motor offers a shorter flux path, keeping the magnets further from the axis. The design allows zero winding overhang; 100 percent of the windings are active. This is enhanced with the use of rectangular-crosssection copper wire. The motors can be stacked to work in parallel. Instabilities are minimized by ensuring that the two rotor discs put equal and opposing forces onto the stator disc. The rotors are connected directly to one another via a shaft ring, cancelling out the magnetic forces.\nServomotor.\nA servomotor is a motor that is used within a position-control or speed-control feedback system. Servomotors are used in applications such as machine tools, pen plotters, and other process systems. Motors intended for use in a servomechanism must have predictable characteristics for speed, torque, and power. The speed/torque curve is important and is high ratio for a servomotor. Dynamic response characteristics such as winding inductance and rotor inertia are important; these factors limit performance. Large, powerful, but slow-responding servo loops may use conventional AC or DC motors and drive systems with position or speed feedback. As dynamic response requirements increase, more specialized motor designs such as coreless motors are used. AC motors' superior power density and acceleration characteristics tends to favor permanent magnet synchronous, BLDC, induction, and SRM drive approaches.\nA servo system differs from some stepper motor applications in that position feedback is continuous while the motor is running. A stepper system inherently operates open-loop\u2014relying on the motor not to \"miss steps\" for short term accuracy\u2014with any feedback such as a \"home\" switch or position encoder external to the motor system.\nStepper motor.\nStepper motors are typically used to provide precise rotations. An internal rotor containing permanent magnets or a magnetically soft rotor with salient poles is controlled by a set of electronically switched external magnets. A stepper motor may also be thought of as a cross between a DC electric motor and a rotary solenoid. As each coil is energized in turn, the rotor aligns itself with the magnetic field produced by the energized field winding. Unlike a synchronous motor, the stepper motor may not rotate continuously; instead, it moves in steps\u2014starting and then stopping\u2014advancing from one position to the next as field windings are energized and de-energized in sequence. Depending on the sequence, the rotor may turn forwards or backwards, and it may change direction, stop, speed up or slow down at any time.\nSimple stepper motor drivers entirely energize or entirely de-energize the field windings, leading the rotor to \"cog\" to a limited number of positions. Microstepping drivers can proportionally control the power to the field windings, allowing the rotors to position between cog points and rotate smoothly. Computer-controlled stepper motors are one of the most versatile positioning systems, particularly as part of a digital servo-controlled system.\nStepper motors can be rotated to a specific angle in discrete steps with ease, and hence stepper motors are used for read/write head positioning in early disk drives, where the precision and speed they offered could correctly position the read/write head. As drive density increased, precision and speed limitations made them obsolete for hard drives\u2014the precision limitation made them unusable, and the speed limitation made them uncompetitive\u2014thus newer hard disk drives use voice coil-based head actuator systems. (The term \"voice coil\" in this connection is historic; it refers to the structure in a cone-type loudspeaker.)\nStepper motors are often used in computer printers, optical scanners, and digital photocopiers to move the active element, the print head carriage (inkjet printers), and the platen or feed rollers.\nSo-called quartz analog wristwatches contain the smallest commonplace stepping motors; they have one coil, draw little power, and have a permanent magnet rotor. The same kind of motor drives battery-powered quartz clocks. Some of these watches, such as chronographs, contain more than one stepper motor.\nClosely related in design to three-phase AC synchronous motors, stepper motors and SRMs are classified as variable reluctance motor type.\nLinear.\nA linear motor is essentially any electric motor that has been \"unrolled\" so that, instead of producing torque (rotation), it produces a straight-line force along its length.\nLinear motors are most commonly induction motors or stepper motors. Linear motors are commonly found in roller-coasters where the rapid motion of the motorless railcar is controlled by the rail. They are also used in maglev trains, where the train \"flies\" over the ground. On a smaller scale, the 1978 era HP 7225A pen plotter used two linear stepper motors to move the pen along the X and Y axes.\nNon-magnetic.\nElectrostatic.\nAn electrostatic motor is based on the attraction and repulsion of electric charge. Usually, electrostatic motors are the dual of conventional coil-based motors. They typically require a high-voltage power supply, although small motors employ lower voltages. Conventional electric motors instead employ magnetic attraction and repulsion, and require high current at low voltages. In the 1750s, the first electrostatic motors were developed by Benjamin Franklin and Andrew Gordon. Electrostatic motors find frequent use in micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) where their drive voltages are below 100 volts, and where moving, charged plates are far easier to fabricate than coils and iron cores. The molecular machinery that runs living cells is often based on linear and rotary electrostatic motors.\nPiezoelectric.\nA piezoelectric motor or piezo motor is a type of electric motor based upon the change in shape of a piezoelectric material when an electric field is applied. Piezoelectric motors make use of the converse piezoelectric effect whereby the material produces acoustic or ultrasonic vibrations to produce linear or rotary motion. In one mechanism, the elongation in a single plane is used to make a series of stretches and position holds, similar to the way a caterpillar moves.\nElectric propulsion.\nAn electrically powered spacecraft propulsion system uses electric motor technology to propel spacecraft in outer space. Most systems are based on electrically accelerating propellant to high speed, while some systems are based on electrodynamic tethers principles of propulsion to the magnetosphere.\nOperating principles.\nForce and torque.\nAn electric motor converts electrical energy to mechanical energy through the force between two opposed magnetic fields. At least one of the two magnetic fields must be created by an electromagnet through the magnetic field caused by an electrical current.\nThe force between a current formula_1 in a conductor of length formula_2 perpendicular to a magnetic field formula_3 may be calculated using the Lorentz force law:\n formula_4\nNote: X denotes vector cross product.\nThe most general approaches to calculating the forces in motors use tensor notation.\nPower.\nElectric motor output power is given as formula_5where:\nIn Imperial units a motor's mechanical power output is given by,\n formula_10 (horsepower)\nwhere:\nIn an asynchronous or induction motor, the relationship between motor speed and air gap power is given by the following:\n formula_13, where\n Rr \u2013 rotor resistance\n Ir2 \u2013 square of current induced in the rotor\n s \u2013 motor slip; i.e., difference between synchronous speed and slip speed, which provides the relative movement needed for current induction in the rotor.\nBack EMF.\nThe movement of armature windings of a direct-current or universal motor through a magnetic field, induce a voltage in them. This voltage tends to oppose the motor supply voltage and so is called \"back electromotive force (EMF)\". The voltage is proportional to the running speed of the motor. The back EMF of the motor, plus the voltage drop across the winding internal resistance and brushes, must equal the voltage at the brushes. This provides the fundamental mechanism of speed regulation in a DC motor. If the mechanical load increases, the motor slows down; a lower back EMF results, and more current is drawn from the supply. This increased current provides the additional torque to balance the load.\nIn AC machines, it is sometimes useful to consider a back EMF source within the machine; this is of particular concern for close speed regulation of induction motors on VFDs.\nLosses.\nMotor losses are mainly due to resistive losses in windings, core losses and mechanical losses in bearings, and aerodynamic losses, particularly where cooling fans are present, also occur.\nLosses also occur in commutation, mechanical commutators spark; electronic commutators and also dissipate heat.\nEfficiency.\nTo calculate a motor's efficiency, the mechanical output power is divided by the electrical input power:\n formula_14,\nwhere formula_15 is energy conversion efficiency, formula_16 is electrical input power, and formula_17 is mechanical output power:\n formula_18\n formula_19\nwhere formula_20 is input voltage, formula_1 is input current, formula_7 is output torque, and formula_23 is output angular velocity. It is possible to derive analytically the point of maximum efficiency. It is typically at less than 1/2 the stall torque.\nVarious national regulatory authorities have enacted legislation to encourage the manufacture and use of higher-efficiency motors. Electric motors have efficiencies ranging from around 15%-20% for shaded pole motors, up to 98% for permanent magnet motors, with efficiency also dependent on load. Peak efficiency is usually at 75% of the rated load. So (as an example) a 10 HP motor is most efficient when driving a load that requires 7.5 HP. Efficiency also depends on motor size; larger motors tend to be more efficient. Some motors can not operate continually for more than a specified period of time (e.g. for more than an hour per run)\nGoodness factor.\nEric Laithwaite proposed a metric to determine the 'goodness' of an electric motor:\nformula_24\nWhere:\n formula_25 is the goodness factor (factors above 1 are likely to be efficient)\n formula_26 are the cross sectional areas of the magnetic and electric circuit\n formula_27 are the lengths of the magnetic and electric circuits\n formula_28 is the permeability of the core\n formula_23 is the angular frequency the motor is driven at\nFrom this, he showed that the most efficient motors are likely to have relatively large magnetic poles. However, the equation only directly relates to non PM motors.\nPerformance parameters.\nTorque.\nElectromagnetic motors derive torque from the vector product of the interacting fields. Calculating torque requires knowledge of the fields in the air gap. Once these have been established, the torque is the integral of all the force vectors multiplied by the vector's radius. The current flowing in the winding produces the fields. For a motor using a magnetic material the field is not proportional to the current.\nA figure relating the current to the torque can inform motor selection. The maximum torque for a motor depends on the maximum current, absent thermal considerations.\nWhen optimally designed within a given core saturation constraint and for a given active current (i.e., torque current), voltage, pole-pair number, excitation frequency (i.e., synchronous speed), and air-gap flux density, all categories of electric motors/generators exhibit virtually the same maximum continuous shaft torque (i.e., operating torque) within a given air-gap area with winding slots and back-iron depth, which determines the physical size of electromagnetic core. Some applications require bursts of torque beyond the maximum, such as bursts to accelerate an electric vehicle from standstill. Always limited by magnetic core saturation or safe operating temperature rise and voltage, the capacity for torque bursts beyond the maximum differs significantly across motor/generator types.\nElectric machines without a transformer circuit topology, such as that of WRSMs or PMSMs, cannot provide torque bursts without saturating the magnetic core. At that point, additional current cannot increase torque. Furthermore, the permanent magnet assembly of PMSMs can be irreparably damaged.\nElectric machines with a transformer circuit topology, such as induction machines, induction doubly fed electric machines, and induction or synchronous wound-rotor doubly fed (WRDF) machines, permit torque bursts because the EMF-induced active current on either side of the transformer oppose each other and thus contribute nothing to the transformer coupled magnetic core flux density, avoiding core saturation.\nElectric machines that rely on induction or asynchronous principles short-circuit one port of the transformer circuit and as a result, the reactive impedance of the transformer circuit becomes dominant as slip increases, which limits the magnitude of active (i.e., real) current. Torque bursts two to three times higher than the maximum design torque are realizable.\nThe brushless wound-rotor synchronous doubly fed (BWRSDF) machine is the only electric machine with a truly dual ported transformer circuit topology (i.e., both ports independently excited with no short-circuited port). The dual ported transformer circuit topology is known to be unstable and requires a multiphase slip-ring-brush assembly to propagate limited power to the rotor winding set. If a precision means were available to instantaneously control torque angle and slip for synchronous operation during operation while simultaneously providing brushless power to the rotor winding set, the active current of the BWRSDF machine would be independent of the reactive impedance of the transformer circuit and bursts of torque significantly higher than the maximum operating torque and far beyond the practical capability of any other type of electric machine would be realizable. Torque bursts greater than eight times operating torque have been calculated.\nContinuous torque density.\nThe continuous torque density of conventional electric machines is determined by the size of the air-gap area and the back-iron depth, which are determined by the power rating of the armature winding set, the speed of the machine, and the achievable air-gap flux density before core saturation. Despite the high coercivity of neodymium or samarium-cobalt permanent magnets, continuous torque density is virtually the same amongst electric machines with optimally designed armature winding sets. Continuous torque density relates to method of cooling and permissible operation period before destruction by overheating of windings or permanent magnet damage.\nOther sources state that various e-machine topologies have differing torque density. One source shows the following:\nwhere\u2014specific torque density is normalized to 1.0 for the surface permanent magnet (SPM)\u2014brushless ac, 180\u00b0 current conduction.\nTorque density is approximately four times greater for liquid cooled motors, compared to those which are air cooled.\nA source comparing direct current, induction motors (IM), PMSM and SRM showed:\nAnother source notes that PMSM up to 1 MW have considerably higher torque density than induction machines.\nContinuous power density.\nThe continuous power density is determined by the product of the continuous torque density and the constant torque speed range. Electric motors can achieve densities of up to 20\u00a0kW/kg, meaning 20 kilowatts of output power per kilogram.\nAcoustic noise and vibrations.\nAcoustic noise and vibrations are usually classified in three sources:\nThe latter source, which can be responsible for the \"whining noise\" of electric motors, is called electromagnetically induced acoustic noise.\nStandards.\nThe following are major design, manufacturing, and testing standards covering electric motors:\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "76095", "revid": "49842254", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=76095", "title": "Avant-garde", "text": "Works that are experimental or innovative\nIn the arts and literature, the term avant-garde (from fr meaning 'advance guard' or 'vanguard') identifies an experimental genre or work of art, and the artist who created it, which usually is aesthetically innovative, whilst initially being ideologically unacceptable to the artistic establishment of the time. The military metaphor of an \"advance guard\" identifies the artists and writers whose innovations in style, form, and subject-matter challenge the artistic and aesthetic validity of the established forms of art and the literary traditions of their time; thus, the artists who created the anti-novel and surrealism were ahead of their times.\nAs a stratum of the intelligentsia of a society, avant-garde artists promote progressive and radical politics and advocate for societal reform with and through works of art. In the essay \"The Artist, the Scientist, and the Industrialist\" (1825), Benjamin Olinde Rodrigues's political usage of \"vanguard\" identified the moral obligation of artists to \"serve as [the] avant-garde\" of the people, because \"the power of the arts is, indeed, the most immediate and fastest way\" to realise social, political, and economic reforms.\nIn the realm of culture, the artistic experiments of the avant-garde push the aesthetic boundaries of societal norms, such as the disruptions of modernism in poetry, fiction, drama, painting, music, and architecture that occurred in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. In art history, the socio-cultural functions of avant-garde art trace from Dada (1915\u20131920s) through the Situationist International (1957\u20131972) to the postmodernism of the American language poets (1960s\u20131970s).\nHistory.\nThe French military term \"avant-garde\" (advanced guard) identified a reconnaissance unit who scouted the terrain ahead of the main force of the army. In 19th-century French politics, the term \"avant-garde\" (vanguard) identified left-wing political reformists who agitated for radical political change in French society. By the mid-19th century, \"avant-garde\" referred to art that used aesthetic innovation as a means of political and social change. Since the 20th century, the art term \"avant-garde\" identifies a stratum of the intelligentsia that comprises novelists, writers, artists, architects, et al. whose creative perspectives, ideas, and experimental artworks challenge the cultural values of contemporary bourgeois society. \nIn the U.S. of the 1960s, the post\u2013WWII changes to American culture and society allowed avant-garde artists to produce works of art that addressed the matters of the day, usually in political and sociologic opposition to the cultural conformity inherent to popular culture and consumerism as a way of life and as a worldview.\nTheories.\nIn \"The Theory of the Avant-Garde\" (; 1962), the academic Renato Poggioli provides an early analysis of the avant-garde in art and as an artistic movement. Surveying the historical, social, psychological, and philosophical aspects of artistic vanguardism, Poggioli's examples of avant-garde art, poetry, and music show that avant-garde artists share some values and ideals as contemporary bohemians.\nIn \"Theory of the Avant-Garde\" (; 1974), the literary critic Peter B\u00fcrger looks at the establishment's embrace of socially critical works of art as capitalist co-optation of the artists and the genre of avant-garde art, because \"art as an institution neutralizes the political content of the individual work [of art]\".\nIn \"Neo-avantgarde and Culture Industry: Essays on European and American Art from 1955 to 1975\" (2000), Benjamin H. D. Buchloh argues for a dialectical approach to such political stances by avant-garde artists and the avant-garde genre of art.\nSociety and the avant-garde.\nSociologically, as a stratum of the intelligentsia of a society, avant-garde artists, writers, architects, et al. produce artefacts \u2013 works of art, books, buildings \u2013 that intellectually and ideologically oppose the conformist value system of mainstream society. In the essay \"Avant-Garde and Kitsch\" (1939), Clement Greenberg said that the artistic vanguard opposes high culture and rejects the artifice of mass culture, because the avant-garde functionally opposes the dumbing down of society \u2013 be it with low culture or with high culture. That in a capitalist society each medium of mass communication is a factory producing artworks, and is not a legitimate artistic medium; therefore, the products of mass culture are \"kitsch\", simulations and simulacra of art.\nWalter Benjamin in the essay \"The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction\" (1939) and Theodor Adorno and Max Horkheimer in \"Dialectic of Enlightenment\" (1947) said that the artifice of mass culture voids the artistic value (the \"aura\") of a work of art. That the capitalist culture industry (publishing, music, radio, cinema, etc.) continually produces artificial culture for mass consumption, which is facilitated by mechanically produced art-products of mediocre quality displacing art of quality workmanship; thus, the profitability of art-as-commodity determines its artistic value.\nIn \"The Society of the Spectacle\" (1967), Guy Debord said that the financial, commercial, and economic co-optation of the avant-garde into a commodity produced by neoliberal capitalism makes doubtful that avant-garde artists will remain culturally and intellectually relevant to their societies for preferring profit to cultural change and political progress. In \"The Theory-Death of the Avant-Garde\" (1991), Paul Mann said that the avant-garde is economically integral to the contemporary institutions of the establishment, specifically as part of the culture industry. Noting the conceptual shift, theoreticians, such as Matei Calinescu in \"Five Faces of Modernity: Modernism, Avant-garde, Decadence, Kitsch, Postmodernism\" (1987), and Hans Bertens in \"The Idea of the Postmodern: A History\" (1995), have said that Western culture entered a post-modern time when the modernist ways of thought-and-action and the production of art became redundant in a capitalist economy.\nScholars have highlighted the troubling associations of avant-garde movements with authoritarian politics and right wing movements in Europe like Nazism and Fascism. Avant-garde figureheads like the American poet Ezra Pound, Wyndham Lewis, and the Italian futurist F.T Marinetti and their alliances with twentieth century authoritarian politics have sparked controversy.\nParting from the claims of Greenberg in the late 1930s and the insights of Poggioli in the early 1960s, in \"The De-Definition of Art: Action Art to Pop to Earthworks\" (1983), the critic Harold Rosenberg said that since the middle of the 1960s the politically progressive avant-garde ceased being adversaries to artistic commercialism and the mediocrity of mass culture, which political disconnection transformed being an artist into \"a profession, one of whose aspects is the pretense of overthrowing [the profession of being an artist].\"\nAvant-garde is frequently defined in contrast to , which in its original military sense refers to a rearguard force that protects the advance-guard. The term was less frequently used than \"avant-garde\" in 20th-century art criticism. The art historians Natalie Adamson and Toby Norris argue that \"arri\u00e8re-garde\" is not reducible to a kitsch style or reactionary orientation, but can instead be used to refer to artists who engage with the legacy of the avant-garde while maintaining an awareness that doing so is in some sense anachronistic. The critic Charles Altieri argues that avant-garde and \"arri\u00e8re-garde\" are interdependent: \"where there is an avant-garde, there must be an \"arri\u00e8re-garde\".\"\nExamples.\nMusic.\nAvant-garde music can refer to any form of music working within traditional structures while seeking to breach boundaries in some manner. The term is used loosely to describe the work of any musicians who radically depart from tradition altogether. By this definition, some avant-garde composers of the 20th century include Arnold Schoenberg, Richard Strauss (in his earliest work), Charles Ives, Igor Stravinsky, Anton Webern, Edgard Var\u00e8se, Alban Berg, George Antheil (in his earliest works only), Henry Cowell (in his earliest works), Harry Partch, John Cage, Iannis Xenakis, Morton Feldman, Karlheinz Stockhausen, Pauline Oliveros, Philip Glass, Meredith Monk, Laurie Anderson, and Diamanda Gal\u00e1s.\nThere is another definition of \"avant-gardism\" that distinguishes it from \"modernism\": Peter B\u00fcrger, for example, says avant-gardism rejects the \"institution of art\" and challenges social and artistic values, and so necessarily involves political, social, and cultural factors. According to the composer and musicologist Larry Sitsky, modernist composers from the early 20th century who do not qualify as avant-gardists include Arnold Schoenberg, Anton Webern, and Igor Stravinsky; later modernist composers who do not fall into the category of avant-gardists include Elliott Carter, Milton Babbitt, Gy\u00f6rgy Ligeti, Witold Lutos\u0142awski, and Luciano Berio, since \"their modernism was not conceived for the purpose of goading an audience.\"\nThe 1960s saw a wave of free and avant-garde music in the jazz genre, embodied by artists such as Ornette Coleman, Sun Ra, Albert Ayler, Archie Shepp, John Coltrane, and Miles Davis. In rock music of the 1970s, the \"art\" descriptor was generally understood to mean \"aggressively avant-garde\" or \"pretentiously progressive\". Post-punk artists from the late 1970s rejected traditional rock sensibilities in favor of an avant-garde aesthetic.\nTheatre.\nThe avant-garde has a significant history in 20th-century music, although it is more pronounced in theatre and performance art, often in conjunction with music and sound design innovations, as well as developments in visual media design. There are movements in theatre history that are characterized by their contributions to the avant-garde traditions in both the United States and Europe. Among these are Fluxus, Happenings, and Neo-Dada.\nArchitecture.\nBrutalist architecture was greatly influenced by an avant-garde movement.\nAvant-garde types.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "76097", "revid": "9784415", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=76097", "title": "Honeysuckle", "text": "Genus of flowering plants\nHoneysuckles are arching shrubs or twining vines in the genus Lonicera () of the family Caprifoliaceae. The genus includes 158 species native to northern latitudes in North America, Eurasia, and North Africa. Widely known species include \"Lonicera periclymenum\" (common honeysuckle or woodbine), \"Lonicera japonica\" (Japanese honeysuckle, white honeysuckle, or Chinese honeysuckle) and \"Lonicera sempervirens\" (coral honeysuckle, trumpet honeysuckle, or woodbine honeysuckle). \"L. japonica\" is a highly invasive species considered a significant pest in parts of North America, Europe, South America, New Zealand, Australia, and Africa.\nSome species are highly fragrant and colorful, so are cultivated as ornamental garden plants. In North America, hummingbirds are attracted to the flowers, especially \"L. sempervirens\" and \"L. ciliosa\" (orange honeysuckle). Honeysuckle derives its name from the edible sweet nectar obtainable from its tubular flowers. The name \"Lonicera\" stems from Adam Lonicer, a Renaissance botanist.\nDescription.\nMost species of \"Lonicera\" are hardy twining climbers, with a minority of shrubby habit. Some species (including \"Lonicera hildebrandiana\" from the Himalayan foothills and \"L. etrusca\" from the Mediterranean) are tender and can be grown outside only in subtropical zones. The leaves are opposite, simple oval, long; most are deciduous but some are evergreen.\nMany of the species have sweetly scented, bilaterally symmetrical flowers that produce a sweet, edible nectar, and most flowers are borne in clusters of two (leading to the common name of \"twinberry\" for certain North American species). Both shrubby and vining sorts have strongly fibrous stems which have been used for binding and textiles.\nThe fruit is a red, blue or black spherical or elongated berry containing several seeds; in most species the berries are mildly poisonous, but in a few (notably \"Lonicera caerulea\") they are edible and grown for home use and commerce. Most honeysuckle berries are attractive to wildlife, which has led to species such as \"L. japonica\" and \"L. maackii\" spreading invasively outside of their home ranges. Many species of \"Lonicera\" are eaten by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species\u2014see a list of Lepidoptera that feed on honeysuckles.\nInvasive species.\nThe spread of \"L. japonica\" in North America began in the United States in 1806, and it was widely cultivated by the 1860s. It was first discovered in Canada in Ontario forests in 1976, and became invasive by 2007. \"L. japonica\" was introduced in Australia between 1820 and 1840.\nSeveral species of honeysuckle have become invasive when introduced outside their native range, particularly in North America, Europe, South America, Australia, and Africa. Invasive species include \"L. japonica\", \"L. maackii\", \"L. morrowii\", \"L. tatarica\", and the hybrid between the last two, \"L.\" \u00d7 \"bella\".\nCultivation.\nHoneysuckles are valued as garden plants, for their ability to cover unsightly walls and outbuildings, their profuse tubular flowers in early summer, and the intense fragrance of many varieties. The hardy climbing types need their roots in shade, and their flowering tops in sunlight or very light shade. Varieties need to be chosen with care, as they can become substantial. Cultivars of the dense, small-leaved \"L. nitida\" are used as low, narrow hedges.\nThe following hybrids have gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit: \n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nOther cultivars are dealt with under their species names.\nThe honeysuckle species \"L. japonica\" is grown as a commercial crop for traditional Chinese medicine use.\nHoneysuckle is also used to scent Chinese teas in a process similar to Jasmine tea. This was popularized in the Qing dynasty.\nPhytochemicals.\nComponent analyses of berries from 27 different cultivars and 3 genotypes of edible honeysuckle (\"Lonicera caerulea\" var. \"kamtschatica\") showed the presence of iridoids, anthocyanins, flavonols, flavanonols, flavones, flavan-3-ols, and phenolic acids. While sugars determine the level of sweetness in the berries, organic acids and polyphenols are responsible for the sour taste and tartness. Some 51 of the same compounds in berries are found in flowers, although the proportions of these compounds varied among cultivars studied.\nInteraction with other species.\nMany insects in the order Lepidoptera visit honeysuckles as a food source. An example of this is the moth \"Deilephila elpenor\". This nocturnal species of moth is especially attracted to honeysuckles, and they visit the flowers at night to feed on their nectar.\nSpecies.\n158 species are accepted.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nSeveral fossil species are known from the Miocene of Asia.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

These lilacs are native to woodland and scrub from southeastern Europe to eastern Asia, and widely and commonly cultivated in temperate areas elsewhere.\nThe genus is most closely related to \"Ligustrum\" (privet), classified with it in Oleaceae tribus Oleeae subtribus Ligustrinae.\nLilacs are used as food plants by the larvae of some moth species, including lilac leaf mining moth, privet hawk moth, copper underwing, scalloped oak and Svensson's copper underwing.\nDescription.\nLilacs are small trees, ranging in size from tall, with stems up to diameter. The leaves are opposite (occasionally in whorls of three) in arrangement, and their shape is simple and heart-shaped to broad lanceolate in most species, but pinnate in a few species (e.g. \"S. protolaciniata\", \"S. pinnatifolia\").\nFlowers.\nThe flowers are produced in spring, each flower being in diameter with a four-lobed corolla, the corolla tube narrow, long; they are monoecious, with fertile stamens and stigma in each flower. The usual flower colour is a shade of purple (often a light purple or \"lilac\"), but white, pale yellow and pink, and even a dark burgundy color are also found.\nThe flowers grow in large panicles, and in several species have a strong fragrance. Flowering varies between mid spring to early summer, depending on the species. One particular cultivar, trademark \"Bloomerang\", first blooms in spring and then again late summer through fall.\nFruit.\nThe fruit is a dry, brown capsule, splitting in two at maturity to release the two winged seeds.\nEtymology.\nThe English common name \"lilac\" is from the French \"lilac\" via the from meaning the indigo plant or \"nilak\" meaning \"bluish\"; both \"lilanj\" and \"nilak\" come from Persian \"n\u012bl\" \"indigo\" or \"nili\" \"dark blue\".\nTaxonomy.\nThe genus \"Syringa\" was first formally described in 1753 by Carl Linnaeus and the description was published in \"Species Plantarum\". The genus name \"Syringa\" is derived from Ancient Greek word \"syrinx\" meaning \"pipe\" or \"tube\" and refers to the hollow branches of \"S. vulgaris\".\nHomonym \"Syringa\" is a heterotypic synonym of Philadelphus.\nCultivation and uses.\nLilacs are popular shrubs in parks and gardens throughout the temperate zone, and several hybrids and numerous cultivars have been developed. The term French lilac is often used to refer to modern double-flowered cultivars, thanks to the work of prolific breeder Victor Lemoine. Lilacs grow most successfully in well-drained soils, particularly those based on chalk. They flower on old wood, and produce more flowers if unpruned. If pruned, the plant responds by producing fast-growing young vegetative growth with no flowers, in an attempt to restore the removed branches. Lilac bushes can be prone to powdery mildew disease.\nLilac wood is not commonly used or commercially harvested due to the small size of the tree. It is a relatively hard wood, with an estimated Janka hardness of 2,350 lbf (10,440 N), and is reportedly good for woodturning. \nThe sapwood is typically cream-coloured and the heartwood can have various streaks of brown and purple.\nSpecies have been historically used in various traditional medicines in Asia for treating ailments including cough, diarrhea, acute icteric hepatitis, vomiting, abdominal pain, and bronchitis. Compounds isolated from species of \"Syringa\" include phenylpropanoids such as syringin and iridoids such as oleuropein. Substituent compounds, such as iridoids, as well as crude extracts from \"Syringa\" plants have been shown to have to have effects including antitumor, antihypertensive, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and antifungal activities in pharmacological studies.\nSymbolism.\nLilacs are often considered to symbolize first love.\nIn Greece, Macedonia, Lebanon, and Cyprus, the lilac is strongly associated with Easter time because it flowers around that time; it is consequently called \"paschalia\".\nIn the poem \"When Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloom'd\", by Walt Whitman, lilacs are a reference to Abraham Lincoln.\nThe music-hall song by Ivor Novello, \"We'll Gather Lilacs\", first performed in 1945, speaks of the longing of two lovers to be reunited in a traditional English rural setting. It has since been recorded and performed by numerous artists.\n\"Syringa vulgaris\" is the state flower of New Hampshire, because it \"is symbolic of that hardy character of the men and women of the Granite State.\"\nFestivals.\nSeveral locations in North America hold annual Lilac Festivals, including:\nSpecies.\nSpecies and subspecies currently accepted as of July 2016:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Over 26,000 cultivars, with more than 51,000 cultivar names, including synonyms, have been registered or published.\nThe leaves of \"C.\u00a0sinensis\" are processed to create tea, and so are of particular economic importance in East Asia, Southeast Asia, and the Indian subcontinent, with the processed leaves widely sold and consumed globally. The ornamental \"C.\u00a0japonica\", \"C.\u00a0sasanqua\" and their hybrids are the source of hundreds of garden cultivars. \"C.\u00a0oleifera\" produces tea seed oil, used in cooking and cosmetics.\nDescription.\nCamellias are evergreen shrubs or small trees up to tall. Their leaves are alternately arranged, simple, thick, serrated, and usually glossy.\nFlowers and fruit.\nTheir flowers are usually large and conspicuous, one to in diameter, with five to nine petals in naturally occurring species of camellias. The colors of the flowers vary from white through pink colors to red; truly yellow flowers are found only in South China and Vietnam. Tea varieties are always white-flowered. Camellia flowers throughout the genus are characterized by a dense bouquet of conspicuous yellow stamens, often contrasting with the petal colors. Some research has shown that the colour of petals in some species' flowers indicate their size and how they are pollinated; species with red or yellow flowers are pollinated by sunbirds whereas species with white flowers are smaller in diameter and are pollinated by bees.\nThe fruit of camellia plants is a dry capsule, sometimes subdivided into up to five compartments. Each compartment contains up to eight seeds.\nEcology.\nCamellia plants are used as food plants by the larvae of some \"Lepidoptera\" species. Leaves of \"Camellia japonica\" are susceptible to the fungal parasite \"Mycelia sterile\" (see below for the significance), \"mycelia sterile PF1022\" produces a metabolite named PF1022A that is used to produce emodepside, an anthelmintic drug.\nDue to habitat destruction, several camellias have become rare in their natural range. One of these is the aforementioned \"C.\u00a0reticulata\", grown commercially in thousands for horticulture and oil production but rare enough in its natural range to be considered a threatened species.\nGrowth.\nThe various species of camellia plants are generally well-adapted to acid soils rich in humus, and most species do not grow well on chalky soil or other calcium-rich soils. Most species of camellias also require a large amount of water, either from natural rainfall or from irrigation, and the plants will not tolerate droughts. However, some of the more unusual camellias \u2013 typically species from karst soils in Vietnam \u2013 can grow without too much water.\nCamellia plants are generally considered slow growing. This slow growth rate makes them well-suited for growing in pots or tubs, and they don't require frequent pruning. While some varieties may grow more quickly than others, particularly when young, the overall growth rate of most camellias is relatively slow. Typically, they will grow about per year until mature \u2013 however, this varies depending on their variety and geographical location.\nHistory and use.\n\"Camellia sinensis\", the tea plant, is of major commercial importance because tea is made from its leaves. The species \"C.\u00a0sinensis\" is the product of many generations of selective breeding to bring out desirable qualities for tea. However, many other camellias can be used to produce a similar beverage. For example, tea made from \"C.\u00a0sasanqua\" leaves is popular in some parts of Japan.\nSeeds of \"C.\u00a0oleifera\", \"C.\u00a0japonica\", and, to a lesser extent, other species such as \"C.\u00a0crapnelliana\", \"C.\u00a0reticulata\", \"C.\u00a0sasanqua\" and \"C.\u00a0sinensis\" as well are pressed to make tea seed oil, a sweet seasoning and cooking oil special to East Asia. It is the most important cooking oil for hundreds of millions of people, particularly in southern China.\nCamellia oil is commonly used to clean and protect the blades of cutting instruments.\nCamellia oil pressed from seeds of \"C.\u00a0japonica\", also called tsubaki oil or in Japanese, has been traditionally used in Japan for hair care. \"C.\u00a0japonica\" plant is used to prepare traditional antiinflammatory medicines.\nGarden history.\nCamellias were cultivated in the gardens of China for centuries before they were seen in Europe. The German botanist Engelbert Kaempfer reported that the \"Japan Rose\", as he called it, grew wild in woodland and hedgerow, but that many superior varieties had been selected for gardens. Europeans' earliest views of camellias must have been their representations in Chinese painted wallpapers, where they were often represented growing in porcelain pots.\nThe first living camellias seen in England were a single red and a single white, grown and flowered in his garden at Thorndon Hall, Essex, by Robert James, Lord Petre, among the keenest gardeners of his generation, in 1739. His gardener James Gordon was the first to introduce camellias to commerce, from the nurseries he established after Lord Petre's untimely death in 1743, at Mile End, Essex, near London.\nWith the expansion of the tea trade in the later 18th century, new varieties began to be seen in England, imported through the British East India Company. The Company's John Slater was responsible for the first of the new camellias, double ones, in white and a striped red, imported in 1792. Further camellias imported in the East Indiamen were associated with the patrons whose gardeners grew them: a double red for Sir Robert Preston in 1794 and the pale pink named \"Lady Hume's Blush\" for Amelia, the lady of Sir Abraham Hume of Wormleybury, Hertfordshire (1806). The camellia was imported from England to America in 1797 when Colonel John Stevens brought the flower as part of an effort to grow attractions within Elysian Fields in Hoboken, New Jersey. By 1819, twenty-five camellias had bloomed in England; that year the first monograph appeared, Samuel Curtis's, \"A Monograph on the Genus Camellia\", whose five handsome folio colored illustrations have usually been removed from the slender text and framed. Though they did not flower for over a decade, camellias that set seed rewarded their growers with a wealth of new varieties. By the 1840s, the camellia was at the height of its fashion as \"the\" luxury flower. The Parisian courtesan Marie Duplessis, who died young in 1847, inspired Dumas' \"La Dame aux cam\u00e9lias\" and Verdi's \"La Traviata\".\nThe fashionable imbricated formality of prized camellias was an element in their decline, replaced by the new hothouse orchid. Their revival after World War I as woodland shrubs for mild climates has been paralleled by the rise in popularity of \"Camellia sasanqua\".\nModern cultivars.\nThe tea camellia, \"C.\u00a0sinensis\", has been selected by many commercial cultivars for the taste of its leaves once processed into tea leaves.\nToday, camellias are grown as ornamental plants for their flowers; about 3,000 cultivars and hybrids have been selected, many with double or semi-double flowers. \"C.\u00a0japonica\" is the most prominent species in cultivation, with over 2,000 named cultivars. Next are \"C.\u00a0reticulata\" with over 400 named cultivars, and \"C.\u00a0sasanqua\" with over 300 named cultivars. Popular hybrids include \"C. \u00d7 hiemalis\" (\"C.\u00a0japonica\" \u00d7 \"C.\u00a0sasanqua\") and \"C. \u00d7 williamsii\" (\"C.\u00a0japonica\" \u00d7 \"C.\u00a0saluenensis\"). Some varieties can grow considerably, up to , though more compact cultivars are available. They are frequently planted in woodland settings alongside other calcifuges, such as rhododendrons. They are particularly associated with areas of high soil acidity, such as Cornwall and Devon in the UK. They are highly valued for their very early flowering, often among the first flowers to appear in the late winter. Late frosts can damage the flower buds, resulting in misshapen flowers.\nThere is a great variety of flower forms:\nAGM cultivars.\nThe following hybrid cultivars have gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit:\nTaxonomy.\nThe genus was named by Linnaeus after the Jesuit botanist Georg Joseph Kamel, who worked in the Philippines and described one of its species (although Linnaeus did not refer to Kamel's account when discussing the genus).

Containing nearly 900 species, it is the largest genus in the family. Common names include campion and catchfly. Many \"Silene\" species are widely distributed, particularly in the northern hemisphere.\nScientific history.\nMembers of this genus have been the subject of research by preeminent plant ecologists, evolutionary biologists, and geneticists, including Charles Darwin, Gregor Mendel, Carl Correns, Herbert G. Baker, and Janis Antonovics. Many \"Silene\" species continue to be widely used to study systems, particularly in the fields of ecology and evolutionary biology. The genus has been used as a model for understanding the genetics of sex determination for over a century. \"Silene\" species commonly contain a mixture of hermaphroditic and female (or male-sterile) individuals (gynodioecy), and early studies by Correns showed that male sterility could be maternally inherited, an example of what is now known as cytoplasmic male sterility. Two independent groups of species in \"Silene\" have evolved separate male and female sexes (dioecy) with chromosomal sex determination that is analogous to the system found in humans and other mammals.\n\"Silene\" flowers are frequently visited by flies, such as \"Rhingia campestris\". \"Silene\" species have also been used to study speciation, host-pathogen interactions, biological species invasions, adaptation to heavy-metal-contaminated soils, metapopulation genetics, and organelle genome evolution. Notably, some members of the genus \"Silene\" hold the distinction of harboring the largest mitochondrial genomes ever identified.\nTaxonomy.\n\"Silene\" was originally described by Linnaeus. Divisions of the genus into subgenera or sections before 2003 do not seem to be well-supported by molecular evidence.\nThe genus \"Lychnis\" is closely related to (and sometimes included in) \"Silene\". When treated as a distinct genus, it can often be differentiated by the number of flower styles (five in \"Lychnis' and three in \"Silene\"), the number of teeth of the seed capsule (five in \"Lychnis' and six in \"Silene\"), and by the sticky stems of \"Lychnis\".\nSexual systems.\nSexual systems vary across species. Most \"Silene\" species are hermaphroditic representing 58.2% of \"Silene\" species, 14.3% are dioecious, 13.3%\u00a0gynodioecious, and 12.2% are both gynodioecious and\u00a0gynomonoecious. Trioecy, andromonoecy, and gynomonoecy have also been reported but are extremely rare.\nEtymology.\n\"Silene\" is the feminine form of Silenus, an Ancient Greek woodland deity who was a companion and tutor to the wine god Dionysus.\nEcology.\nLychnis is also the common name of \"Hadena bicruris\", a species of noctuid moth. The larva of this moth feeds on \"Silene\" (formerly \"Lychnis\") species, as do some other Lepidoptera including cabbage moths (recorded on \"Silene chalcedonica\"), grey chi and case-bearers of the genus \"Coleophora\" including \"C. albella\" (feeds exclusively on \"Silene flos-cuculi\").\nUses.\nMany species of \"Silene\" are in cultivation for perennial gardens. Some have gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit, including \"Silene flos-jovis\" and \"Silene schafta\".\n\"Silene undulata\" (syn. \"S. capensis\") is known as \"iindlela zimhlophe\" (\"white paths\") by the Xhosa of South Africa. A Xhosa diviner identifies and collects the plant from the wild. The roots are ground, mixed with water, and beaten to a froth, which is consumed by novice diviners during the full moon to influence their dreams. They also take it to prepare for various rituals. The root has such a strong, musky essence that the diviners who consume it exude the scent in their sweat.\n\"Silene vulgaris\", or bladder campion, is eaten in some Mediterranean countries. Young leaves may be eaten raw, and mature leaves are boiled, fried, stewed or mixed into dishes such as risotto.\nFossil record.\nFossil \"Silene microsperma\" seeds from the Chattian stage of the Oligocene have been found in the Oberleichtersbach Formation in the Rh\u00f6n Mountains of central Germany.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Home to a population of over 26,000, Hervanta is best known for its prefabricated blocks of flats. The total number of apartments is about 11,000. Nearly a fifth of the inhabitants (some 4,500 people) are students, many of them enrolled at the Tampere University of Technology (TUT) or the Police College. The largest student housing complex is Mikontalo, in fact nearly 3% of people in Hervanta reside there. Approximately 10% of Hervanta's population is composed of foreigners from 75 different nationalities.\nHervanta was known as a notorious neighborhood for a long time, but its reputation has improved considerably over time. It was selected as Finland's top suburb in a survey conducted by the newspaper and published on 17 August 2003.\nThe complex of commercial buildings in the town center of Hervanta was designed by the Finnish architect Reima Pietil\u00e4.\nTechnology.\nHervanta is sometimes called the Silicon Valley of Finland, because of the high concentration of high tech companies in the area and the presence of the Tampere University of Technology. As well as the University, Hervanta is also home to the Hermia science centre and the VTT office complex.

The ruins of the city can be found in the Sybaris archaeological park near Sibari in the Province of Cosenza, Calabria, Italy.\nHistory.\nFoundation.\nThurii was founded as a colony of Athens along with exiles from Sybaris in 443 BC. Justin writes that people say that the city of Thurii was built by Philoctetes and his monument is seen there even to his days, as well as the arrows of Hercules which laid up in the temple of Apollo. The site of that city had remained desolate for a period of 58 years after its destruction by the Crotoniats; when at length, in 452 BC, a number of the Sybarite exiles and their descendants made an attempt to establish themselves again on the spot, under the guidance of some leaders of Thessalian origin; and the new colony rose so rapidly to prosperity that it excited the jealousy of the Crotoniats, who, in consequence, expelled the new settlers a little more than 5 years after the establishment of the colony. The fugitive Sybarites first appealed for support to Sparta, but without success: their application to the Athenians was more successful, and that people determined to send out a fresh colony, at the same time that they reinstated the settlers who had been lately expelled from thence. A body of Athenian colonists was accordingly sent out by Pericles, under the command of Lampon and Xenocritus. Pericles' expressed intent was for it to be a Panhellenic colony, and the number of Athenian citizens was small, the greater part of those who took part in the colony being collected from various parts of Greece. Among them were two celebrated names: Herodotus the historian, and the orator Lysias, both of whom appear to have formed part of the original colony. Hippodamus also went out with the colonists and became the architect of the new city.\nThe laws of the new colony were established by the sophist Protagoras at the request of Pericles, adopting the laws of Zaleucus of Locri.\nThe new colonists at first established themselves on the site of the deserted Sybaris, but shortly afterwards removed (apparently in obedience to an oracle) to a spot at a short distance from thence, where there was a fountain named \"Thuria\", from whence the new city derived its name of Thurii. The foundation of Thurii is assigned by Diodorus to the year 446 BC; but other authorities place it three years later, 443 BC, and this seems to be the best authenticated date. The protection of the Athenian name probably secured the rising colony from the assaults of the Crotoniats, at least nothing is heard of any obstacles to its progress from that quarter; but it was early disturbed by dissensions between the descendants of the original Sybarite settlers and the new colonists, the former laying claim not only to honorary distinctions, but to the exclusive possession of important political privileges. These disputes at length ended in a revolution, and the Sybarites were finally expelled from the city. They established themselves for a short time in Sybaris on the Traeis but did not maintain their footing long, being dislodged and finally dispersed by the neighboring barbarians. The Thurians meanwhile concluded a treaty of peace with Crotona, and the new city rose rapidly to prosperity. Fresh colonists poured in from all quarters, especially the Peloponnese; and though it continued to be generally regarded as an Athenian colony, the Athenians in fact formed but a small element of the population. The citizens were divided, as we learn from Diodorus, into ten tribes, the names of which sufficiently indicate their origin. They were: the Arcadian (from Arcadia), Achaean (from Achaea), Elean (from Elea), Boeotian (from Boeotia), Amphictyonic (from Amphictyonis), Dorian (from Doris), Ionian (from Ionia), Athenian (from Athens), Euboean (from Euboea), and Nesiotic (from the islands). The form of government was democratic, and the city is said to have enjoyed the advantage of a well-ordered system of laws; but the statement of Diodorus, who represents this as owing to the legislation of Charondas, and that lawgiver himself as a citizen of Thurii, is certainly erroneous. The city itself was laid out with great regularity, being divided by four broad streets or plateae, each of which was crossed in like manner by three others.\nWar and conflict.\nVery shortly after its foundation, Thurii became involved in a war with Tarentum (modern Taranto). The subject of this was the possession of the fertile district of the Siritis, about 50\u00a0km north of Thurii, to which the Athenians had a claim of long standing, which was naturally taken up by their colonists. The Spartan general, Cleandridas, who had been banished from Greece some years before, and taken up his abode at Thurii, became the general of the Thurians in this war, which, after various successes, was at length terminated by a compromise, both parties agreeing to the foundation of the new colony of Heracleia in the disputed territory.\nKnowledge of the history of Thurii is very scanty and fragmentary. Fresh disputes arising between the Athenian citizens and the other colonists were at length allayed by the oracle of Delphi, which decided that the city had no other founder than Apollo. But the same difference appears again on occasion of the great Athenian expedition to Sicily, when the city was divided into two parties, the one desirous of favoring and supporting the Athenians, the other opposed to them. The latter faction at first prevailed, so far that the Thurians observed the same neutrality towards the Athenian fleet under Nicias and Alcibiades as the other cities of Italy. Thurii was, in fact, the city where Alcibiades escaped his Athenian captors who were taking him home for trial.\nBut two years afterwards (413 BC) the Athenian party had regained the ascendency; and when Demosthenes and Eurymedon touched at Thurii, the citizens afforded them every assistance, and even furnished an auxiliary force of 700 hoplites and 300 dartmen. From this time we hear nothing of Thurii for a period of more than 20 years, though there is reason to believe that this was just the time of its greatest prosperity. In 390 BC we find that its territory was already beginning to suffer from the incursions of the Lucanians, a new and formidable enemy, for protection against whom all the cities of Magna Graecia had entered into a defensive league. But the Thurians were too impatient to wait for the support of their allies, and issued forth with an army of 14,000 foot and 1000 horse, with which they repulsed the attacks of the Lucanians; but having rashly followed them into their own territory, they were totally defeated, near La\u00fcs, and above 10,000 of them cut to pieces.\nThis defeat must have inflicted a severe blow on the prosperity of Thurii, while the continually increasing power of the Lucanians and Bruttians in their immediate neighbourhood would prevent them from quickly recovering from its effects. The city continued also to be on hostile, or at least unfriendly, terms with Dionysius of Syracuse, and was in consequence chosen as a place of retirement or exile by his brother Leptines and his friend Philistus. The rise of the Bruttian people about 356 BC probably became the cause of the complete decline of Thurii, but the statement of Diodorus that the city was conquered by that people must be received with considerable doubt.\nIt reappears in history at a later period, when Corinthian soldiers en route to join Timoleon on his expedition to Syracuse are blockaded there by Carthaginian ships. At this point it was still an independent Greek city, though much fallen from its former greatness. No mention of it is found during the wars of Alexander of Epirus in this part of Italy.\nLater it was so hard pressed by the Lucanians that it had recourse to alliance with Rome and a Roman army was sent to its relief under Gaius Fabricius Luscinus in 282 BC. He defeated the Lucanians and Bruttians, who had laid siege to the city, in a pitched battle and several other successes broke their power, and thus relieved the Thurians from all immediate danger from that quarter. But shortly after they were attacked on the other side by the Tarentines, who are said to have taken and plundered their city; and this aggression was one of the immediate causes of the war declared by the Romans against Tarentum in 282 BC.\nRoman dependency.\nThurii became a dependent ally of Rome, and was protected by a Roman garrison. \nIt played a considerable part in the Second Punic War with Hannibal. It was one of the cities which defected to the Carthaginians after the battle of Cannae in 212 BC. After the defection of Tarentum, they betrayed the Roman troops into the hands of the Carthaginian general Hanno. A few years later (210 BC), Hannibal, finding himself unable to protect his allies in Campania, removed the inhabitants of Atella who had survived the fall of their city to Thurii; but it was not long before he was compelled to abandon the latter city also to its fate. When he himself in 204 BC withdrew his forces into Bruttium, he removed to Crotona 3500 of the principal citizens of Thurii, while he gave up the city itself to the plunder of his troops. \nIt is evident that Thurii was now sunk to the lowest state of decay, but the great fertility of its territory rendered it desirable to preserve it from utter desolation. Hence in 194 BC, it was one of the places selected for the establishment of a Roman colony with Latin rights. The number of colonists was small in proportion to the extent of land to be divided among them, but they amounted to 3000 foot and 300 knights. Livy says merely that the colony was sent in \"Thurinum agrum\", but Strabo tells us that the Romans gave the new colony the name of Copiae, as confirmed both by Stephanus of Byzantium and by the evidence of coins, on which, however, the name is written \"COPIA\". But this new name did not continue long in use, and Thurii still continued to be known by its ancient appellation. It is mentioned as a municipal town on several occasions during the latter ages of the Roman Republic. In 72 BC it was taken by Spartacus and subjected to heavy contributions but not otherwise injured. According to Suetonius, the Octavian family held some renown there, and Gaius Octavius (father of the future Caesar Augustus) defeated a Spartacist army near there. As a result, the future emperor was granted the surname Thurinus shortly after birth. At the outbreak of the Civil Wars, it was deemed by Julius Caesar of sufficient importance to be secured with a garrison of Gaulish and Spanish horse, and it was there that M. Caelius Rufus was put to death, after a vain attempt to excite an insurrection in this part of Italy. In 40 BC also it was attacked by Sextus Pompeius, who laid waste its territory, but he was repulsed from the walls of the city.\nThurii was at this time still a place of some importance, and it is mentioned as an existing town by Pliny and Ptolemy, as well as Strabo. It was probably, indeed, the only place of any consideration remaining on the coast of the Tarentine gulf between Crotona and Tarentum; both Metapontum and Heracleia having already fallen into almost complete decay. Its name is still found in the Itineraries, and it is noticed by Procopius as still existing in the 6th century.\nAbandonment.\nOver time, the sediment accretion of the Crathis river caused its river delta to shift towards the sea at a long term rate of one metre a year. As a consequence the successive sites of Sybaris, Thurii, and Copia became landlocked and lost their importance because they no longer had easy access to the sea for trade. It seems to have been abandoned during the Middle Ages when the inhabitants took refuge at a place called Terranova (Terranova da Sibari), about 15 km inland, on a hill on the left bank of the Crathis.\nThe exact location of Greek Thurii is not known but that of the Roman town, which probably occupied the same site, is fixed by several ruins as being about 6 km to the east of Terranova da Sibari and as occupying an area some 6\u00a0km in circuit. It is clear from the statements of Diodorus and Strabo that Thurii occupied a site near to, but distinct from, that of Sybaris. It is more likely that the true site is north of the Coscile (the ancient Sybaris), a few kilometers from the sea, where ruins still exist. Roman ruins on the peninsula formed by the rivers Crathis and Sybaris may also perhaps be those of Thurii.\nThe site.\nOne house stands out by size and decoration: the large \"domus\" located behind the Theatre, undoubtedly one of the most sumptuous private buildings in the Roman city. It was built in the late Republican era (1st century BC) and survived until the 5th century AD through a series of expansions and transformations that gradually modified the layout. The monumentality and the splendour of the house reached their peak between the 1st and 3rd centuries AD while from the 4th are tangible signs of a decline.\nCoinage.\nThurii had an active mint in antiquity. The coins of Thurii are of great beauty; their number and variety indeed gives us a higher idea of the opulence and prosperity of the city than we should gather from the statements of ancient writers."}

Unlike the typical analog clocks at the time, Pallweber's design used double-sided metal tablets suspended in drums: a minute drum with 60 tablets and an hour drum with 24 tablets. Each tablet displayed the upper half of a number on one side and the lower half of the next number on the reverse, so that when one tablet stood upright and the next hung down, they formed a complete number visible through a reading window. Production of Pallweber's flip clock design began around 1894 at Lenzkirch Clock Factory.\nThe flip clock saw further development by American inventor Eugene L. Fitch, who patented the Plato clock in 1902. After a varied career including work as a merchant and inventor of typewriter mechanisms, Fitch entered the field of horology with no prior experience. His Plato clock was designed to provide an instant time display using two sets of rotating plates: one for hours and one for minutes, intended not only for timekeeping but also as a method of advertising. Fitch's original design featured vertical disks holding the plates, with each plate marked \"ADV\" on its back, reflecting his initial vision for clocks as an advertising medium. Subsequent designs were no longer marked in this way.\nFitch continued to develop the Plato clock over the course of four patents. The first in 1902 introduced the basic concept, but the vertical disk arrangement posed aesthetic and functional challenges. His second patent in 1903 shifted the disks to a horizontal position, improving the layout of the clock and allowing for larger numbers by making use of both sides of the plates. This change would introduce new mechanical issues, however, such as the plates failing to stack properly. Fitch addressed this problem in his third patent, also in 1903, by tilting the drive shaft and adding a ball bearing to reduce friction. At this point in development, the increased complexity of the clock had made production unviable, with three sets of plates containing over 900 parts. Fitch's fourth patent in 1904 refined the design using lightweight celluloid plates with die-cut \"ears\" as pivots, thereby eliminating the need for ball bearings, and introducing cams to prevent premature hour flips. This final design became the prototype for production models.\nProduction of the Plato clock began between 1904 and 1906, financed by Conrad Hubert, president of the American Everready Company. The clock was a commercial success, with approximately 40,000 units sold. The name \"Plato\" derived from \"plate-o,\" referencing the plate mechanism, though the name was often associated with the philosopher Plato. Early models were manufactured by the Ansonia Clock Company, with variations including glass domes and alternative winding mechanisms. A license was granted to a French firm which produced 30-hour and 8-day models of the Plato clock, while German copies by firms like Lenzkircher Uhren Fabrik and Gebr. Junghans soon followed.\nDevelopment of the flip clock continued beyond Fitch's work. Early designs relied on mechanical movements, and material limitations posed durability issues, with the plates often becoming warped beyond repair. By the mid-20th century, electromechanical flip clocks were developed. A significant improvement to the design came from Josef Mergenhagen in Germany during the 1950s. Initially using a 30-hour non-jewel movement, Mergenhagen upgraded it to an 8-day, 7-jewel mechanism and modernized the case design. After early plastic plates faced similar warping issues to previous clocks, he sourced a superior plastic from a German manufacturer, which resolved the issue of warping and allowed the plates to remain flat under various conditions. His models, marked \"J. Mergenhagen West Germany,\" included both vertical and horizontal versions.\nMethod of operation.\nAn electric motor (often synchronous, if directly connected to the AC line) turns two sets of wheels continuously via a reduction gear train: the faster at a rate of 1 revolution per hour, the slower at a rate of 1 revolution per 24 hours. The wheels move continuously, not in steps.\nThe faster wheel has connected to it a ring of 60 flat plastic leaves. On the leaves are printed numerals so that, when a person holds two adjacent leaves apart like an open book, the two open leaves spell out a numeral, and flipping a leaf down increases the number shown by 1 unit. The \"book\" is opened vertically, and its pages form a ring. This ring is put into position and rotated so that one page falls each minute, showing a new number for the minutes.\nThe slower wheel has connected to it a similar ring of leaves, only there are 48 leaves on this ring. These leaves have hour numbers printed on them. There are two of each hour, like this: 12am, 12am, 1am, 1am, 2am, 2am, ... 11pm, 11pm in a 12-hour clock, and 0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2, ... 23, 23 in a 24-hour clock. Having two sets of leaves for each hour also allows the clock to alternate between 12- and 24-hour display, every half hour, like this: 12am, 0h, 1am, 1h, 2am, 2h, ... 11pm, 23h. One leaf falls each half-hour, at approximately 25 and 55 minutes after the hour. A different design features 60 leaves with the numbers 1 to 12 repeated in fives, each leaf falling after 12 minutes. The disadvantage of this is that 24-hour clocks cannot use this design, nor there is a way to show \"AM\" or \"PM\" information in a 12-hour design.\nMinute leaves 45 through 59 have a small tooth on their left edges, pointing toward the hour leaves. The purpose of this tooth is as follows: at 45 minutes after the hour, the tooth pushes a small hook that protrudes into the hour wheel area. This hook will catch any falling hour leaf (as mentioned above, it falls from its metal tab a few minutes before the hour) until it is released by the minute leaf's fall at the top of the hour.\nDaylight saving time.\nMany vintage digital clocks with split flap displays cannot be wound back, as the flip mechanism operates only in one direction. Instead they must be either wound forward 23 hours to achieve the effect of winding back 1 hour at the end of daylight saving time or the clock may be stopped (by disconnecting it from power) for 1 hour. However, on some newer clocks, forward and backward time setting is possible. GE clocks sometimes had this feature. \nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Casper is the second-most populous city in the state after Cheyenne, with the population at 59,038 as of the 2020 census. Casper is nicknamed \"The Oil City\" and has a long history of oil boomtown and cowboy culture, dating back to the development of the nearby Salt Creek Oil Field.\nCasper is located in east central Wyoming on the North Platte River.\nHistory.\nThe city was established east of the former site of Fort Caspar, in an area that grew for European settlers during the mid-19th century mass migration of land seekers along the Oregon, California, and Mormon trails, where several nearby ferries offered passage across the North Platte River in the early 1840s. In 1859, Louis Guinard built a bridge and trading post near the original ferry locations, allowing overland travel to continue through the area.\nThe government also posted the military garrison to protect telegraph and mail service. It was under the command of Lieutenant Colonel William O. Collins. Native American attacks increased after the Sand Creek Massacre in Colorado in 1864, bringing more troops to the post, which was by now called Platte Bridge Station. In July 1865, Lt. Colonel William Collins' beloved son Lieutenant Caspar Collins was killed near the post by a group of Indian warriors, and three months later the garrison was renamed Fort Caspar in his son's honor.\nIn 1867, the troops were ordered to abandon Fort Caspar in favor of Fort Fetterman, downstream on the North Platte along the Bozeman Trail. However, the town itself was settled twenty years later in 1887, and incorporated a year later by developers as an anticipated stopping point during the expansion of the Wyoming Central Railway.\nA site a few miles east was planned as the original site, where homesteader Joshua Stroud lived prior to the actual construction of the train station for the Chicago and North Western Railway. The site was laid out by the Pioneer Town Site Company in 1888 and was known as Strouds, but the name Casper soon prevailed. While the name is derived from Fort Caspar and Lt. Caspar Collins, it is officially named \"Casper\" due to a typo occurring during the official registration.\nCasper was an early commercial rival to both Bessemer and Douglas, Wyoming. The absence of a railhead doomed Bessemer in favor of Casper, while Douglas, also a railhead, survives to the present day. This rail presence also made Casper the starting off point for the \"invaders\" in the Johnson County War, since the chartered train carrying the men from Texas stopped at Casper.\nIn more recent history, the city received a significant influx of visitors during the solar eclipse of August 21, 2017, due to its position along the path of totality.\nGeography.\nInterstate 25, which approaches Casper from the north and east, is the main avenue of transportation to and from the city. The towns immediately adjacent to Casper are Mills, Evansville, and Bar Nunn. Unincorporated areas include Allendale, Dempsey Acres, Red Buttes, Indian Springs, and several others.\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water.\nClimate.\nCasper, as with most of the rest of Wyoming, has a continental semi-arid climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification: \"BSk\"), with long, cold, but dry winters, hot but generally dry summers, mild springs, and short and crisp autumns. Normal daily maxima range from in January to in July. Snow can fall heavily during the winter and early to mid-spring months, and usually falls in May and October. Precipitation is greatest in spring and early summer, but even then it is not high. Highs reach on 37.8 days per year and fail to surpass freezing on 41.3. Lows drop to on an average of 14.6 nights annually. The highest temperature recorded in Casper was on July 12, 1954, July 16, 2005, and July 29, 2006, while the lowest temperature recorded was on December 22, 2022.\nDemographics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"US Census population/styles.css\"/&gt;\n2010 census.\nAs of the census of 2010, there were 55,316 people, 22,794 households, and 14,237 families residing in the city.

The median age was 36 years. For every 100 females, there were 95.0 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 91.6 males.\nThe median income for a household in the city was $36,567, and the median income for a family was $46,267. Males had a median income of $34,905 versus $21,810 for females. The per capita income for the city was $19,409. About 8.5% of families and 11.4% of the population were below the poverty line, including 15.4% of those under age 18 and 7.3% of those age 65 or over.\nEconomy.\nCasper is a regional center of banking and commerce.\nAfter the discovery of crude oil in the region during the 1890s, Casper became the regional petroleum industry center. Oil has figured prominently in its history from nearly the outset. Oil was first discovered in the famous Salt Creek Oil Field in 1889, approximately north of Casper; the first refinery in Casper was built in 1895. The city has featured a refinery ever since, although various refineries have been built and closed over the years. As recently as the early 1980s, the city was near or home to three refineries. The surviving one, operated by Sinclair Oil Corporation, is located nearby in Evansville. Development of Wyoming coal and uranium fields in recent decades has helped Casper continue its role as a center in the energy industry.\nCasper Wind Farm began operations near Casper in Natrona County and has 11 turbines with a generating capacity of 16.5 MW. Energy Transportation Inc. is headquartered in Casper. This logistics firm transports overweight and outsized components used in the wind power industry. The Casper landfill is also a disposal site for windmill blades.\nEducation.\nCasper is home to Casper College, a community college that offers bachelor's degrees in sixteen areas of study from the University of Wyoming through their UW/CC Center.\nPublic education in the city of Casper is provided by Natrona County School District #1. The district operates sixteen elementary schools, five middle schools, and three high schools in Casper. The high schools are Kelly Walsh, Natrona County, and Roosevelt High Schools. A program called CAPS is being added to Natrona County School District, which will provide more space and classrooms for juniors and seniors at the three high schools.\nCasper has a public library, a branch of the Natrona County Public Library System.\nMedia.\nCasper is served by one print newspaper, the \"Casper Star-Tribune\", a daily, and until recently the \"Casper Journal\", published weekly. Casper is also home to WyoFile, an online publication focusing on state issues and \"Oil City News,\" an online news and media site.\nSports.\nSports teams based in Casper include:\nCulture.\nMuseums and historical sites.\nCasper is home to a number of museums and historical sites:\nPerforming arts and music.\nCasper has three locations offering theater: the Gertrude Krampert Theatre at Casper College, Stage III Community Theatre, and the Casper Events Center where an annual series of touring Broadway shows, \"Broadway in Casper\", can be seen.\nCasper is home to the Troopers, a drum and bugle corps in Drum Corps International, and the Wyoming Symphony Orchestra. During the summer months, Casper's City Band performs free concerts Thursday evenings at Washington Park, weather permitting.\nArchitecture.\nWyoming National Bank, a mid-century modern tower, was designed by Charles Deaton and is featured in Casper's logo.\nTransportation.\nHighways.\nInterstate Highways:\nUS Routes:\nWyoming State Highways:\nAirports.\nThe city has scheduled air service at Casper\u2013Natrona County International Airport, a former army air base built during World War II. The runways are large, having been built for bombers. It replaced a regional airport north of Casper which later became the town of Bar Nunn, Wyoming. The airport is located west of the city just off of US Highway 20/26. In July 2004, the airport facilities were renovated. Passenger service at the airport is offered by United Express (SkyWest Airlines and GoJet Airlines), and Delta Connection (SkyWest Airlines). FedEx Express and FedEx Feeder provide cargo airline service to the airport.\nPublic transit.\nPublic transit in the Casper area had been provided by the Casper Area Transportation Coalition but is now offered by the city of Casper as Casper Area Transit. They offer fixed route service called Casper Area LINK and an on-request service called ASSIST from Monday to Saturday.\nScheduled bus service.\nScheduled bus service once offered by Power River Bus Lines is now offered by ExpressArrow (formerly Black Hills Stages).\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "76142", "revid": "51011568", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=76142", "title": "Hydrangea", "text": "Genus of flowering plants\nHydrangea ( or ) is a genus of more than 70 species of flowering plants native to Asia and the Americas. Hydrangea is also used as the common name for the genus; some (particularly \"H. macrophylla\") are also often called hortensia. The genus was first described from Virginia in North America, but by far the greatest species diversity is in eastern Asia, notably China, Korea, and Japan. Most are shrubs tall, but some are small trees, and others lianas reaching up to by climbing up trees. They can be either deciduous or evergreen, though the widely cultivated temperate species are all deciduous.\nThe flowers of many hydrangeas act as natural pH indicators, producing blue flowers when the soil is acidic and pink ones when the soil is alkaline.\nEtymology.\n\"Hydrangea\" is derived from Greek and means 'water vessel' (from \"h\u00fad\u014dr\" \"water\" + \"\u00e1ngos\" or \"ange\u00eeon\" \"vessel\"), in reference to the shape of its seed capsules. The earlier name, \"Hortensia\", is a Latinised version of the French given name Hortense. Philibert Commerson had attempted to call the flower \"Lepautia\" or \"Peautia\" in honor of French astronomer and mathematician Nicole-Reine Lepaute, but the common name for the flower instead became \"Hortensia\". This led people to believe that Lepaute's name was Hortense, but the Larousse remarks that this is erroneous, and that the name probably came from \"hortus\", garden.\nLife cycle.\n\"Hydrangea\" flowers are produced from early spring to late autumn; they grow in flowerheads (corymbs or panicles) most often at the ends of the stems. Typically the flowerheads contain two types of flowers: small non-showy fertile flowers in the center or interior of the flowerhead, and large, sterile showy flowers with large colorful sepals (tepals). These showy flowers are often extended in a ring, or to the exterior of the small flowers. Plants in wild populations typically have few to none of the showy flowers, while cultivated hydrangeas have been bred and selected to have more of the larger type flowers.\nThere are two flower arrangements in hydrangeas with corymb style inflorescences, which includes the commonly grown \"bigleaf hydrangea\"\u2014\"Hydrangea macrophylla\". Mophead flowers are large round flowerheads resembling pom-poms or, as the name implies, the head of a mop. In contrast, lacecap flowers bear round, flat flowerheads with a center core of subdued, small flowers surrounded by outer rings of larger flowers having showy sepals or tepals. The flowers of some rhododendrons and viburnums can appear, at first glance, similar to those of some hydrangeas.\nColors and soil acidity.\nHydrangea flower color can change based on the pH in soil. As the graph depicts, soil with a pH of 5.5 or lower will produce blue flowers, a pH of 6.5 or higher will produce pink hydrangeas, and soil in between 5.5 and 6.5 will have purple hydrangeas. White hydrangeas cannot be color-manipulated by soil pH because they do not produce pigment for color. In other words, while the hue of the inflorescence is variable dependent upon cultural factors, the color saturation is genetically predetermined. In most species, the flowers are white. In some, however, (notably \"H. macrophylla\"), they can be blue, red, or purple, with color saturation levels ranging from the palest of pinks, lavenders &amp; powder blues, to deep, rich purples, reds, and royal blues. In these species, floral color change occurs due to the availability of aluminium ions, a variable which itself depends upon the soil pH. For \"H. macrophylla\" and \"H. serrata\" cultivars, the flower color can be determined by the relative acidity of the soil: an acidic soil (pH below 7), will have available aluminium ions and typically produce flowers that are blue to purple, whereas an alkaline soil (pH above 7) will tie up aluminium ions and result in pink or red flowers. This is caused by a color change of the flower pigments in the presence of aluminium ions which can be taken up into hyperaccumulating plants.\nSpecies.\n98 species are accepted.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nFossil record.\n\u2020\"Hydrangea alaskana\" is a fossil species recovered from Paleogene strata at Jaw Mountain Alaska. \u2020\"Hydrangea knowltoni\" has been described from leaves and flowers recovered from the Miocene Langhian Latah Formation of the inland Pacific Northwest United states. The related Miocene species \u2020\"Hydrangea bendirei\" is known to from the Mascall Formation in Oregon, and \u2020\"Hydrangea reticulata\" is documented from the Weaverville Formation in California.\nFour fossil seeds of \u2020\"Hydrangea polonica\" have been extracted from borehole samples of the Middle Miocene fresh water deposits in Nowy Sacz Basin, West Carpathians, Poland.\nCultivation and uses.\nHydrangeas are popular ornamental plants, grown for their large flowerheads, with \"Hydrangea macrophylla\" being by far the most widely grown. It has over 600 named cultivars, many selected to have only large sterile flowers in the flowerheads. \"Hydrangea macrophylla\", also known as bigleaf hydrangea, can be broken up into two main categories; mophead hydrangea and lacecap hydrangea. Some are best pruned on an annual basis when the new leaf buds begin to appear. If not pruned regularly, the bush will become very \"leggy\", growing upwards until the weight of the stems is greater than their strength, at which point the stems will sag down to the ground and possibly break. Other species only flower on \"old wood\". Thus, new wood resulting from pruning will not produce flowers until the following season.\nThe following cultivars and species have gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit under the synonym \"Schizophragma\": \nHydrangea root and rhizome are indicated for the treatment of conditions of the urinary tract in the Physicians' Desk Reference for Herbal Medicine and may have diuretic properties. Hydrangeas are moderately toxic if eaten, with all parts of the plant containing cyanogenic glycosides. \"Hydrangea paniculata\" is reportedly sometimes smoked as an intoxicant, despite the danger of illness and/or death due to the cyanide.\nThe flowers on a hydrangea shrub can change from blue to pink or from pink to blue from one season to the next depending on the acidity level of the soil. Adding organic materials such as coffee grounds and citrus peel will increase acidity and turn hydrangea flowers blue.\nA popular pink hydrangea called Vanilla Strawberry has been named \"Top Plant\" by the American Nursery and Landscape Association.\nA hybrid \"Runaway Bride Snow White\", from Japan, won \"Plant of the Year\" at the 2018 RHS Chelsea Flower Show.\nIn culture.\nIn Japan, \"ama-cha\" (), meaning sweet tea, is another herbal tea made from \"Hydrangea serrata\", whose leaves contain a substance that develops a sweet taste (phyllodulcin). For the fullest taste, fresh leaves are crumpled, steamed, and dried, yielding dark brown tea leaves. Ama-cha is mainly used for \"kan-butsu-e\" (the Buddha bathing ceremony) on April 8 every year\u2014the day thought to be Buddha's birthday in Japan. During the ceremony, ama-cha is poured over a statue of Buddha and served to people in attendance. A legend has it that on the day Buddha was born, nine dragons poured Amrita over him; ama-cha is substituted for Amrita in Japan.\nIn Korean tea, \"Hydrangea serrata\" is used for an herbal tea called \"sugukcha\" () or \"isulcha\" ().\nThe pink hydrangea has risen in popularity all over the world, especially in Asia. The given meaning of pink hydrangeas is popularly tied to the phrase \"you are the beat of my heart,\" as described by the celebrated Korean florist Tan Jun Yong, who was quoted saying, \"The light delicate blush of the petals reminds me of a beating heart, while the size could only match the heart of the sender!\"\n\"Hydrangea quercifolia\" was declared the official state wildflower of the U.S. state of Alabama in 1999.\nHydrangeas were used by the Cherokee people of what is now the Southern U.S. as a mild diuretic and cathartic; it was considered a valuable remedy for bladder stones.\nExtrafloral nectaries were reported on hydrangea species by Zimmerman 1932, but Elias 1983 regards this as \"doubtful\".\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is derived by hybridization from several species in the section \"Melanium\" (\"the pansies\") of the genus \"Viola\", particularly \"V.\u00a0tricolor\", a wildflower of Europe and western Asia known as heartsease. It is sometimes known as \"V. tricolor\" var. \"hortensis\", but this scientific name is suspect. While \"V.\u00a0tricolor\" var. \"hortensis\" is a synonym of \"Viola\" \u00d7 \"wittrockiana\", \"V.\u00a0tricolor\" var. \"hortensis\" refers to a horticultural variety of wild pansy (\"V.\u00a0tricolor\" without interspecific hybridization) that had been illustrated in \"Flora Danica\" in 1777 before the existence of \"Viola\" \u00d7 \"wittrockiana\".\nThe chromosome number of \"Viola\" \u00d7 \"wittrockiana\" is 2n = 44\u201352, with most cultivars being 2n = 48. The flower is in diameter and has two slightly overlapping upper petals, two side petals, and a single bottom petal with a slight beard emanating from the flower's center. These petals are usually white or yellow, purplish, or blue. The plant may grow to in height, and prefers sun to varying degrees and well-draining soils.\nTerminology.\nEnglish common names, such as \"pansy\", \"viola\" and \"violet\" may be used interchangeably. One possible distinction is that plants considered to be \"pansies\" are classified in \"Viola\" sect. \"Melanium\", and have four petals pointing upwards (the two side petals point upwards), and only one pointing down, whereas those considered to be \"violets\" are classified in \"Viola\" sect. \"Viola\", and have two petals pointing up and three pointing down. Another possible distinction is made by the American Violet Society \u2013 the International Cultivar Registration Authority for the genus \"Viola\". It divides cultivated varieties (cultivars) in \"Viola\" sect. \"Melanium\" into four subgroups: B1 \u2013 pansies, B2 \u2013 violas, B3 \u2013 violettas and B4 \u2013 cornuta hybrids. On this classification, modern \"pansies\" differ from the other three subgroups by possessing a well-defined \"blotch\" or \"eye\" in the middle of the flower.\nModern horticulturalists tend to use the term \"pansy\" for those multi-coloured large-flowered hybrids that are grown for bedding purposes every year, while \"viola\" is usually reserved for smaller, more delicate annuals and perennials.\nEtymology.\nThe name \"pansy\" is derived from the French word \"pens\u00e9e\", \"thought\", and was imported into Late Middle English as a name of \"Viola\" in the mid-15th century, as the flower was regarded as a symbol of remembrance. The name \"love in idleness\" implied the image of a lover who has little or no other employment than to think of his beloved.\nThe name \"heart's-ease\" came from St.\u00a0Euphrasia, whose name in Greek signifies cheerfulness of mind. The woman, who refused marriage and took the veil, was considered a pattern of humility, hence the name \"humble violet\".\nIn Scandinavia, Scotland, and Germany, the pansy is known as the \"stepmother\" flower; an aitiological tale about a selfish stepmother is told to children while the teller plucks off corresponding parts of the blossom. The German name is \"Stiefm\u00fctterchen\" (lit.\u2009'little stepmother'); in the German version of the tale, the lower petal represents the stepmother, the large upper petals represent her daughters, and the small upper petals represent her stepdaughters. The Czech name for the flower, \"mace\u0161ka\", also means \"little stepmother\" and is said to derive from the flower's resemblance of an evil woman's sullen face. In Slovenian, the flower is instead identified with an orphan.\nIn Italy, the pansy is known as \"flammola\" (little flame).\nIn Israel, the pansy is called Amnon Ve'Tamar, (\u05d0\u05de\u05e0\u05d5\u05df \u05d5\u05ea\u05de\u05e8), named after the rape story of Amnon and Tamar, in which Amnon raped his half-sister Tamar. The name was suggested by Shaul Tchernichovsky.\nCultivation.\nHistorical background.\nIn the early 19th century, Lady Mary Elizabeth Bennet (1785\u20131861), daughter of Emma, Lady Tankerville and the Earl of Tankerville, collected and cultivated every sort of \"Viola tricolor\" (commonly, heartsease) she could procure in her father's garden at Walton-upon-Thames, Surrey. Under the supervision of her gardener, William Richardson, a large variety of plants was produced via cross-breeding. In 1812, she introduced her pansies to the horticultural world, and, in 1813, Mr. Lee of Vineyard Nursery, a well-known florist and nurseryman, discovered her collection and further cultivated the flower. Other nurserymen followed Lee's example, and the pansy became a favorite among the public.\nAbout the same time that Lady Bennett was busy cultivating heartsease, James, Lord Gambier was doing the same in his garden at Iver under the advice and guidance of his gardener William Thompson. A yellow viola, \"Viola lutea\", and a wide-petalled pale yellow species of Russian origin, \"Viola altaica\" were among the crosses that laid the foundation for the new hybrids classed as \"Viola\" \u00d7 \"wittrockiana\", named for the Swedish botanist Veit Brecher Wittrock (1839\u20131914). A round flower of overlapping petals was the aim of some early experimenters; in the late 1830s a chance sport that no longer had narrow nectar guides of dark color on the petals but a broad dark blotch on the petals (which came to be called the \"face\"), was found. It was developed in Gambier's garden and released to the public in 1839 with the name \"Medora\".\nBy 1833, there were 400 named pansies available to gardeners who once considered its progenitor, heartsease, a weed. Specific guidelines were formulated for show pansies but amateur gardeners preferred the less demanding fancy pansies. About this time, James Grieve developed the viola and Dr. Charles Stuart developed the violetta, both smaller, more compact plants than the pansy.\nModern horticulture.\nModern horticulturists have developed a wide range of pansy flower colors and bicolors including yellow, gold, orange, purple, violet, red, white, and even near-black (very dark purple). Pansies typically display large showy face markings. The Joker Series has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.\nPlants grow well in sunny or partially sunny positions in well-draining soils. Pansies are perennial, but normally grown as biennials or annuals because of their leggy growth. The first year plant produces greenery, and bears flowers and seeds in its second year of growth. Afterwards, the plant dies like an annual. Because of selective human breeding, most garden pansies bloom the first year, some in as little as nine weeks after sowing. \nPansies are purchased as six-packs or \"flats\" (US) of young plants from garden centers and planted directly into the garden soil. Plants will grow up to in height with flowers measuring in diameter, though smaller and larger flowering cultivars are available.\nPansies are winter hardy in zones 4\u20138. They can survive light freezes and short periods of snow cover, but, in areas with prolonged snow cover, a covering of a dry winter mulch is recommended. In warmer climates, USDA zones 9\u201311, pansies can bloom over the winter, and are often planted in the fall. In warmer zones, pansies may re-seed themselves and return the next year. They are not very heat-tolerant; warm temperatures inhibit blooming and hot muggy air causes rot and death. In colder zones, pansies may not survive without snow cover or protection (mulch) from extreme cold or periods of freezing and thawing. They perform best in zones with moderate temperatures, and equal amounts of mild rainfall and sunshine.\nPansies, for best growth, are watered thoroughly about once a week, depending on climate and rainfall. The plant should never be over-watered. To maximize blooming, plant foods are used about every other week, depending on the type of food used. Regular deadheading can extend the blooming period.\nPests and diseases.\nAphids.\nAphids, which can spread the cucumber mosaic virus, sometimes feed on pansies.\nLeaf spot.\nLeaf spot (\"Ramularia deflectens\") is a fungal infection. Symptoms include dark spots on leaf margins followed by a white web covering the leaves. It is associated with cool damp springs.\nDowny mildew.\nPansy downy mildew is caused by the oomycete \"Peronospora violae\", which produces purple-brown leaf spots, often with encircling yellowing, that have an accompanying grey mold on the leaf underside. It can severely weaken or kill affected plants.\nPowdery mildew.\nA disease caused by one or more species of fungus in the Erysiphaceae family. Symptoms include violet-gray powder on fringes and underside of leaves. It is encouraged by stagnant air and can be limited but not necessarily eliminated by fungicide application.\nSlugs and snails.\nSlugs and snails feed on the foliage.\nStem rot.\nStem rot, also known as pansy sickness, is a soil-borne fungus and a possible hazard with unsterilized animal manure. The plant may collapse without warning in the middle of the season. The foliage will flag and lose color. Flowers will fade and shrivel prematurely. Stem will snap at the soil line if tugged slightly. The plant is probably a total loss unless tufted. The treatment of stem rot includes the use of fungicides such as Cheshunt or Benomyl, which are used prior to planting. Infected plants are destroyed (burned) to prevent the spread of the pathogen to other plants.\nCucumber mosaic virus.\nThe cucumber mosaic virus is transmitted by aphids. Pansies with the virus have fine yellow veining on young leaves, stunted growth and anomalous flowers. The virus can lie dormant, affect the entire plant and be passed to next generations and to other species. Prevention is key: purchases should consist entirely of healthy plants.\nIn culture.\nSymbolism.\nThe pansy's connection to pious humility is mentioned by Harte, who writes: \"From brute beasts humility I learned;/And in the pansy\u2019s life God\u2019s providence discerned\".\nGifford evokes both Christian and classical undertones, writing how \"Pansies \u2013 still,/More blest than me, thus shall ye live/Your little day, \u2013 and when ye die,/Sweet flowers! The grateful muse/Shall give a verse\".\nSmart proposes \"Were it not for thee, oh sun,/Those pansies, that reclining from the bank/View through the immaculate, pellucid stream,/Their portraiture in the inverted Heaven,/Might as well change their triple boast, the white,/The purple, and the gold\".\nOn account of its popularity in both society and its recurring appearances in Romantic poetry, a variety of new nicknames for the flower began to circulate. Dorothea Lynde Dix proclaims that \u201cPerhaps no flower (not excepting even the queenly rose) claims to be so universal a favorite, as the viola tricolor; none currently has been honored with so rich a variety of names, at once expressive of grace, delicacy and tenderness.\u201d Many of these names play on the whimsical nature of love, including \u201cThree Faces under a Hood,\u201d \u201cFlame Flower,\u201d \u201cJump Up and Kiss Me,\u201d \u201cFlower of Jove,\u201d and \u201cPink of my John.\u201d\nIn \"Hamlet\", Ophelia distributes flowers with the remark, \"There's pansies, that's for thoughts\" (IV.5). Other poets referencing the pansy include Ben Jonson, Bernard Barton, Michael Drayton, Edmund Spenser, William Wakefield, and William Wordsworth.\nNathaniel Hawthorne published his last literary effort, an unfinished piece, entitled \"Pansie, a Fragment\", sometimes called \"Little Pansie, a fragment\" in 1864.\nD. H. Lawrence's \"Pansies: Poems by D. H. Lawrence\" was published in 1929, and Margaret Mitchell originally chose Pansy as the name of her \"Gone with the Wind\" heroine, but settled on Scarlett just before the book went into print.\nThe word \"pansy\" has indicated an effeminate male since Elizabethan times and its usage as a disparaging term for a man or boy who is effeminate, as well as for an avowedly homosexual man, is still in use. The word \"ponce\" (which has now come to mean a pimp) and the adjective \"poncey\" (effeminate) also derive from \"pansy\".\nVisual arts.\nIn the visual arts, Pierre-Joseph Redout\u00e9 painted \"Bouquet of Pansies\" in 1827, and, in 1874, Henri Fantin-Latour painted \"Still Life with Pansies\". In 1887, Vincent van Gogh painted \"Mand met viooltjes\", and, in 1926, Georgia O'Keeffe created a painting of a black pansy called simply, \"Pansy\" and followed it with \"White Pansy\" in 1927. J. J. Grandville created a fantasy flower called Pens\u00e9e in his \"Fleurs Anim\u00e9es\".\nAs an emblem.\nBecause its name means \"thought\", the pansy was chosen as a symbol of Freethought and has been used in the literature of the American Secular Union. Humanists use it too, as the pansy's current appearance was developed from the heartsease by two centuries of intentional crossbreeding of wild plant hybrids.\nThe specific colors of the flower \u2013 purple, yellow, and white \u2013 are meant to symbolize memories, loving thoughts and souvenirs, respectively.\nThe Freedom From Religion Foundation (FFRF) uses the pansy symbol extensively in its lapel pins and literature. The flower has long been associated with human manner, as one man cleverly stated: \u201cNature sports as much with the colours of this little flower as she does with the features of the human countenance.\u201d\nTraditions and uses.\nIn William Shakespeare's \"A Midsummer Night's Dream\", the \"juice of the heartsease\" is a love potion and \"on sleeping eyelids laid, will make a man or woman madly dote upon the next live creature that it sees.\" (II.1).\nIn the language of flowers, a honeyflower and a pansy left by a lover for his beloved means, \"I am thinking of our forbidden love\". In 1858, the writer James Shirley Hibberd wrote that the French custom of giving a bride a bouquet of pansies (thoughts) and marigolds (cares) symbolized the woes of domestic life rather than marital bliss.\nA German fable tells of how the pansy lost its perfume. Originally pansies would have been very fragrant, growing wild in fields and forests. It was said that people would trample the grass completely in eagerness to pick pansies. Unfortunately, the people\u2019s cows were starving due to the ruined fields, so the pansy prayed to give up her perfume. Her prayer was answered, and without her perfumed scent, the fields grew tall, and the cows grew fat on the fresh green grass.\nAmerican pioneers thought that \u201ca handful of violets taken into the farmhouse in the spring ensured prosperity, and to neglect this ceremony brought harm to baby chicks and ducklings.\u201d On account of its place in American hearts, a game called \u201cViolet War\u201d also arose. In this game, two players would intertwine the hooks where the pansy blossoms meet the stems, then attempt to pull the two flowers apart like wishbones. Whoever pulled off the most of their opponent\u2019s violet heads was proclaimed the winner. Young American settlers also made pansy dolls by lining up the pansy flower \u201cfaces\u201d, pasting on leaf skirts and twig arms to complete the figures.\nThe pansy is also used in herbalism and traditional medicine.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "76165", "revid": "3784107", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=76165", "title": "Pontiac (automobile)", "text": "Discontinued automobile brand owned by General Motors\nPontiac, formally the Pontiac Motor Division of General Motors, was an American automobile brand owned, manufactured, and commercialized by General Motors. It was introduced in 1926 as a companion make for GM's more expensive line of Oakland automobiles. Pontiac quickly overtook Oakland in popularity and supplanted its parent entirely by 1933, establishing its position as one of GM's dominant divisions.\nSold in the United States, Canada, and Mexico by GM, Pontiac came to represent affordable, practical transportation emphasizing performance. The division\u2019s name stems from the Odawa chieftain Pontiac, who led an indigenous uprising from 1763 until 1766 around Detroit, Michigan.\nIn the hierarchy of GM's five divisions, it slotted above Chevrolet but below Oldsmobile, Buick, and Cadillac. Starting with the 1959 models, marketing was focused on selling the lifestyle that the car's ownership promised rather than the car itself. By emphasizing its \"Wide Track\" design, Pontiac billed itself as the \"performance division\" of General Motors that marketed cars with the \"we build excitement\" tag line.\nFacing financial problems in the late 2000s, and a need to restructure as a prerequisite for a $53 billion government bailout, GM agreed to discontinue the Pontiac brand. The final Pontiac, a white G6, was assembled on January 4, 2010. Franchise agreements for Pontiac dealers expired on October 31, 2010, leaving GM to focus on its four remaining North American brands: Chevrolet, Buick, Cadillac, and GMC.\nHistory.\n1926\u20131942.\nThe Oakland Motor Car Company was founded in 1907 in Pontiac, Michigan, by Edward Murphy, a manufacturer of horse-drawn carriages. The following year, another former buggy company executive, William C. Durant, founded General Motors in Flint, Michigan, as a holding company for the Buick Motor Company. GM soon bought other automakers, including Oldsmobile and Cadillac. In 1909, Oakland became part of GM. The first model made its debut as the Oakland Four from 1909 until it was replaced by the Oakland Six in 1916. In 1926 the Pontiac Series 6-27 was introduced as a junior brand to Oakland, which featured a six-cylinder engine. Within months of its introduction, Pontiac was outselling Oakland, and became its own GM division when Oakland was canceled in 1931.\nIt was named after the famous Odawa chief, who had also given his name to the city of Pontiac, Michigan, where the car was produced. Body styles offered included a sedan with both two and four doors, Landau Coupe, with the Sport Phaeton, Sport Landau Sedan, Sport Cabriolet, and Sport Roadster.\nPontiacs were also manufactured from knock-down kits at GM's Japanese factory at Osaka Assembly in Osaka, Japan, from 1927 until 1941.\nPontiac produced cars offering , (3.25\u00d73.75 in, 82.5\u00d795mm) L-head straight-six cylinder engines in the Pontiac Series 6-27 of 1927; its stroke was the shortest of any American car in the industry at the time. The Series 6-27 sold 39,000 units within six months of its appearance at the 1926 New York Auto Salon, hitting 76,742 in 12 months. The next year, 1928, it became the top-selling six-cylinder car in the U.S., as well as ranking seventh in overall sales. When the Wall Street Crash of 1929 occurred in September, both Pontiac and Oakland sales dropped dramatically and because Oakland was the more expensive, GM leadership decided that Pontiac should remain.\n1932 was the first year for the Pontiac Series 302 V8. The 1932 V8 had an oversquare bore and stroke of x displacing with a compression ratio of 5.2:1. Horsepower was rated at @3200 RPM using three main bearings, solid valve lifters and a Marvel one-barrel carburetor. Unusually, Pontiac switched to the straight-eight for 1933 until it was replaced in 1954.\nAs the economy began to recover, by 1933, Pontiac had moved up to producing the least expensive cars available with straight-eight engines. This was achieved by using many components from the six-cylinder Chevrolet Master, such as the body. The Pontiacs were differentiated by a large chrome strip on the top and center of the front hood that Pontiac called the \"Silver Streak\". Only eight-cylinder engines were offered in 1933 and 1934, displacing rated at .\nIn 1935, Pontiac shared the \"torpedo\" body appearance with the LaSalle and the Cadillac Series 60, just prior to its being used by Chevrolet, earning some media attention for the marque. At the 1939 New York World's Fair, a 1939 Deluxe Six was displayed with body panels made entirely from plexiglass. An unusual feature of the \"torpedo\"-bodied exhibition car was that, with the push of a button, the front half of the body would open showing the engine and the car's front seat interior.\nA major change occurred in 1937, when all Pontiac models except the new station wagon began using the all-steel B-body shared with Oldsmobile, LaSalle, and small Buicks. A new stronger X frame had a Hotchkiss drive using a two-part drive shaft. The eight-cylinder had a wheelbase, while the six-cylinder had a wheelbase. Both engines increased displacements with the six going to producing and the eight to rated at .\nFrom 1940 through 1942, the Pontiac Torpedo was the brand's only model built on three different bodies: the \"A\" body shared with Chevrolet, the \"B\" body shared with Oldsmobile and Buick, and the \"C\" body shared with the large Oldsmobile, Buick, and the small Cadillac. It shared some appearances with the Opel Kapit\u00e4n. In 1941 the Pontiac Streamliner appeared with a straight-8 engine, and on February 2, 1942, the last civilian Pontiac automobile was manufactured in the United States, as all automobile factories converted to military production.\nThe prewar through the early 1950s Pontiacs were not powerful as they featured the heavy and long Pontiac straight-8 engine, which was less expensive to produce than the increasingly popular V8s. Their long crankshaft suffered from excessive flex, thus limiting them to a low compression ratio with a modest redline.\n1946\u20131954.\nFrom 1946 until 1948, all Pontiac models were essentially 1942 models with minor changes. The Hydramatic automatic transmission was introduced in 1948 and helped Pontiac sales grow even though their cars, Torpedoes, and Streamliners, were becoming out of date.\nThe first all-new Pontiac models appeared in 1949. They incorporated styling cues such as lower body lines and rear fenders that were integrated into the rear-end styling of the car. The Chieftain line was introduced to replace the Torpedo. Built on the GM B-body platform, the Chieftain featured different styling from the Streamliner. In 1950, the Catalina pillarless hardtop coupe was introduced as a \"halo\" model, similar to the Chevrolet Bel Air of the same year.\nIn 1952, Pontiac discontinued the Streamliner and replaced it with additional models in the Chieftain line built on the GM A-body platform. This single model line continued until 1954 when the Star Chief was added. The Star Chief featured a stretch to the A-body platform giving it a wheelbase.\nThe 1953 models were the first to have one-piece windshields instead of the previous two-piece units. While the 1953 and 1954 models were heavily reworked versions of the 1949-52 Chieftain models, they were engineered for the V8 engine that was supposed to be introduced on the 1953 models, but the Buick division complained to GM's management that the introduction might take sales away because Buick was introducing the new nailhead V8 in 1953.\nIn 1954, Pontiac continued to build upon the design and engineering of their vehicles, which had seen significant updates in previous years. While the 1953 and 1954 models were reworked versions of the 1949-1952 Chieftain models, the year 1954 brought a unique marketing strategy to the forefront. Pontiac introduced an advertising campaign that featured striking prints depicting the impressive feats of Native American tribes. These prints showcased various aspects of tribal life, from awe-inspiring acts of construction to hunting and other means of survival. The campaign not only highlighted the rich heritage and craftsmanship of Native American cultures but also added an element of cultural resonance to the Pontiac brand, creating a unique and memorable connection with potential customers.\n1955\u20131960.\nCompletely new bodies and chassis were introduced for the 1955 model year and sales increased. A new overhead-valve Strato Streak V8 engine was introduced. With the introduction of this V8, the six-cylinder engines were discontinued; a six-cylinder would not return to the full-size Pontiac line until the GM corporate downsizing of 1977.\nIn 1956, when Semon \"Bunkie\" Knudsen became general manager of Pontiac, alongside new heads of engineering, E. M. Estes and John DeLorean, Knudsen began reworking the brand's image. One of the first steps involved the removal of the \"silver streaks\" from the hood and deck lid which were a traditional styling feature beginning in 1933. These were eliminated from the 1957 models just weeks before they were introduced. The first Bonneville was also introduced. This was a version of the Star Chief convertible to showcase Pontiac's first fuel-injected engine. About 630 Bonnevilles were built in 1957. As a sporting model, they were built on the short wheelbase Chieftain chassis. Pontiac marketing described all Pontiac's as \"America's No. 1 Road Car\".\nThe following year, the Bonneville became its own line, built on the wheelbase of the B-body platform. A 1958 Tri power Bonneville was the pace car for that year's Indianapolis 500. The 1958 model year was final use of the \"Indian\" motif throughout the vehicle. The only exception would be the Indian head high-beam indicator light in the instrument cluster. All 1958 models featured ball joint front suspension replacing the previous kingpin design.\nWith the 1959 model year, Pontiac came out with its \"Arrowhead\" emblem, with the star design in the middle. The \"Arrowhead\" design ran all the way up the hood from between the split grille, and on Star Chief models, had eight chrome stars from the emblem design on the body sides as chrome trim. Knudsen directed that the Pontiacs received a completely reworked chassis, body, and interior styling. Quad headlamps, as well as a longer, lower body, were some of the styling changes.\nThe Chieftain line was renamed Catalina; the Star Chief was downgraded to replace the discontinued Super Chief series and for the first time did not have a two-door hardtop, only a two-door sedan along with a four-door hardtop and four-door sedan; in addition, there was no Star Chief wagon. The Bonneville was now the top of the line, coming in three body styles: a two-door hardtop, a four-door hardtop, and a four-door station wagon. The Star Chief's four-door \"Vista\" hardtop was also shared by the Bonneville. Catalina models included a two-door hardtop, two-door sedan, four-door sedan, and four-door hardtop as well as two station wagons, a six-passenger with two rows of seats, and a nine-passenger version with a rear-facing third row. Bonneville and Star Chief were built on a wheelbase with the exception of the Bonneville wagon, and all Catalina models and the Bonneville wagon rode on a wheelbase. Catalina was also shorter than Bonneville and Star Chief and weighed less than its long-wheelbase counterparts. All 1959 Pontiacs were equipped with a V8 engine with horsepower ratings from to a \"Tri-power\" carbureted version. All automatics were four-speed Super-Hydra-Matics or, as the Hydramatic Division that designed and built them called them, \"Controlled coupling HydraMatic\". Oldsmobile used this same transmission and called it Jetaway Hydramatic; Cadillac also used it and called it 315 or P 315 Hydramatic. A three-speed, column-mounted stick shift was standard on all Pontiacs. This coincided with major body styling changes across all models that introduced increased glass area, twin V-shaped fins, and lower hood profiles. \"Motor Trend\" magazine selected the Pontiac line as the 1959 Car of the Year. The 1959s featured a wider track. The increase to was because Knudsen noticed the new, wider bodies looked awkward on the carried-over 1958 frames. The new \"Wide-Track\" Pontiacs improved styling, handled better, and contributed to Pontiac's resurgence in the marketplace.\nThe 1960 models had a complete reskinning with the exception of the body's canopies, which remained identical to the 1959s, but removed the tail fins and the distinctive split grille. The 1960 models' standard engine had a power gain of 3\u00a0hp due to a compression increase of .25. The Ventura was introduced, and a more luxurious hardtop coupe with the four-door hardtop built on the shorter wheelbase platform, thus positioned between the Catalina and Star Chief models. The Ventura featured the luxury features of the Bonneville in the shorter, lighter Catalina body.\n1961\u20131970.\nMost of Pontiac's models built during the 1960s and 1970s were either styled like or were siblings with other GM makes (except Cadillac). Pontiac retained its own front- and rear-end styling, interiors, and engines.\nThe 1961 models were restyled. The split grille returned, as well as all-new bodies and a new design of a perimeter-frame chassis for all its full-size models (something which would be adopted for all of GM's intermediate-sized cars in 1964, and all its full-sized cars in 1965). These new chassis allowed for reduced weight and smaller body sizes. The similarly styled Chevrolet still used the \"X\" frame from the early 1960s.\nA new compact Tempest was introduced for the 1961 model year. It was one of the three Buick-Olds-Pontiac (BOP) models introduced that year, sharing the platform with the Buick Special, Skylark, and Oldsmobile F-85. A four-cylinder engine was also introduced in the Tempest model line.\nAll three BOP cars were unibody, dubbed the Y-body platform, combining the frame and body into a single construction, making them comparatively lighter and smaller. All three put into production new technology pushed by John DeLorean, on which GM had been working for several years prior, but the Tempest was by far the most radical. A flexible steel shaft rotating at the speed of the engine delivered power from the front-mounted engine through a \"torque tube\" to a rear-mounted transaxle. This provided close to a 50/50 front-rear weight distribution that improved handling as well as incorporated four-wheel independent suspension. The design almost eliminated the large floor \"hump\" common to front-engined, rear-drive cars.\nThough the Tempest's transaxle was similar to the one in the Corvair, introduced the year before, it shared essentially no common parts. GM had planned to launch a Pontiac version of the Corvair (dubbed \"Polaris\"), but Bunkie Knudsen\u2014whose niece had been seriously injured in a Corvair crash\u2014successfully argued against the idea. The Polaris design apparently made it to full-scale clay before it was canceled. Instead, DeLorean's \"rope-shaft\" design was green-lighted.\nThe Tempest won the \"Motor Trend\" \"Car of the Year\" award in 1961. Toward the end of 1961, an upscale version of the Tempest called the LeMans was introduced.\nThe Tempest featured a inline slant-four cylinder engine, derived from the right bank of Pontiac's 389 V8, enabling it to be run down the same production line and reducing costs. the engine received a crankshaft designed for four cylinders, but this did not completely solve its balance issues. The engine gained the nickname \"Hay Baler\" because of its tendency to kick violently, like the farm machine.\nAn optional Buick V8, was not popular when it was available for 1961 and 1962 in the Tempest. For 1963, Pontiac replaced it with a new \"326\" that was actually V8 with a bore of 3.78 and stroke of 3.75 (same stroke as the 389). It was based and shared parts with the 389, but an altered, reduced bore. The car's body and suspension were also changed to be lower, longer, and wider. The response was that more than half of the 1963 Tempests and LeMans (separate lines for that one year only) were ordered with the V8. The next year, the 326 became a true 326 with a new bore size of 3.72. The Tempest's popularity helped move Pontiac into third place among American car brands in 1962, a position Pontiac would hold through 1970.\nIn November 1961, Knudsen moved to Chevrolet. Pete Estes now became general manager of Pontiac and DeLorean was promoted to Pontiac chief engineer. Both continued Knudsen's work of making Pontiac a performance-car brand. Pontiac capitalized on the emerging trend toward sportier bucket-seat coupes in 1962 by introducing the Grand Prix, taking the place of the Ventura, which now became a trim option on the Catalina. Although GM officially ended factory support for all racing activities across all of its brands in January 1963, Pontiac continued making larger engines with more power available across all model lines.\nFor 1963, the Grand Prix received the same styling changes as other full-sized Pontiacs such as vertical headlights and new body lines with a squared-off roofline with a concave rear window, along with less chrome. The concave rear window was replicated on Tempest/LeMans four-door intermediates in 1964 and 1965.\nFor 1964, the Tempest and LeMans' transaxle design was dropped and the cars were redesigned under GM's new A-body platform - frame cars with a conventional front-engined, rear-wheel drive layout. The most important of these is the GTO. In spite of a GM unwritten edict against engines larger than in intermediate cars, DeLorean (with support from Jim Wangers from Pontiac's ad agency), came up with the idea to offer the GTO as an option package that included a engine rated at .\nThe entire Pontiac lineup was selected as Motor Trend's Car of the Year for 1965, the third time Pontiac received this recognition. The February 1965 issue of Motor Trend was almost entirely devoted to Pontiac's Car of the Year award and included feature stories on the division's marketing, styling, engineering, and performance efforts along with road tests of several models. The GTO was split from being an option on the Tempest LeMans series to becoming a separate GTO series.\nThe 1966 model year saw the introduction of a completely new overhead camshaft (OHC) 6-cylinder engine in the Tempest. The 1962 Jeep Tornado engine was the first post-World War II U.S.-designed mass-produced OHC engine while the Pontiac OHC I6 was available in popular-priced domestic cars. In an industry first, plastic grilles were used on several models.\nThe 1967 model year saw the introduction of the Pontiac Firebird pony car, a variant of the Chevrolet Camaro. Intermediate-sized cars (Tempest, LeMans, GTO) were mildly face-lifted, but all full-size cars and GTO lost their Tri-Power engine option, though they did get a larger V8 that replaced the previous 389. Full-sized cars got a major facelift with rounder wasp-waisted body lines, a name change for the mid-line series from Star Chief to Executive as well as a one-year-only Grand Prix convertible.\n1968 introduced the Endura 'rubber' front bumper on the GTO, the precursor to modern cars' integrated bumpers, and the first of a series of \"Ram Air\" engines, which featured the induction of cold air to the carburetor for more power. The Tri carburetor deletion came from the 14th floor of GM banning multiple carburetions and was headed by GM president Ed Cole. The Ram Air V option was not popular. Full-sized cars and intermediates reverted from vertical to horizontal headlights while the 2+2 was dropped from the lineup.\nFor 1969, Pontiac moved the Grand Prix from the full-sized lineup into a G-body model of its own based on the A-body intermediate four-door modified from to wheelbase chassis, but with different styling and long hood/short deck proportions to compete in the intermediate-sized personal luxury car segment. Pete Estes, who like Knudsen had moved to be general manager of Chevrolet in 1966, and DeLorean, general manager of the Pontiac division, needed a car to take the place of the sagging sales of the full-size Grand Prix, but the development cost of the car was too much of burden for Pontiac division alone, so Delorean went to his old boss at Chevrolet to gather support for the development cost of the new \"G\" body Grand Prix. Estes agreed to share in the cost and allow Pontiac to have a one-year exclusivity on this new car; the next year Chevy would follow with its version which was called Chevrolet Monte Carlo. The new Grand Prix was such a sales success in 1969 as dealers moved 112,000 units - more than four times the number of Grand Prixs sold in 1968. Full-sized Pontiacs were also restyled but retained the same basic under-body structure and chassis that debuted with the 1965 model \u2014 the roof-lines for the four-door pillared sedans and Safari wagons were the same as the 1965 models, while the two-door semi-fastback design gave way to a squared-off notch-back style and four-door hardtop sedans were also more squared off than 1967 and 1968 models. The GTOs and Firebirds received the Ram Air option, the GTO saw the addition of the \"Judge\" performance/appearance package, and the Firebird also got the \"Trans Am\" package. Although originally conceived as a model to compete in the Trans Am racing series, in a cost-saving move the Pontiac Trans Am debuted with the standard engines. This year also saw DeLorean leaving the post of general manager to accept a similar position at GM's Chevrolet division. His replacement was F. James McDonald.\nPontiacs built in the late 1960s conformed to new U.S. Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards. These included energy-absorbing interior parts such as steering columns, steering wheels, knobs and handles, dual-circuit hydraulic brake systems, shoulder belts, side marker lights, and headrests.\nThe 1969 Firebirds received a heavy facelift but otherwise continued much the same as the original 1967 model. It was the final year for the overhead cam six-cylinder engine in Firebirds and intermediates, and the Firebird convertible (until 1991). Production of the 1969 Firebirds was extended into the first three months of the 1970 model year (all other 1970 Pontiacs debuted September 18, 1969) due to a decision to delay the introduction of an all-new 1970 Firebird (and Chevrolet Camaro) until February 26, 1970.\nIn addition in the late-1960s, GM directed their GM and Pontiac divisions to develop concept mini-cars called \"commuter cars\" for urban drivers. GM developed a gasoline-electric drive hybrid, the XP-833, and the Pontiac X-4, a rear-wheel drive mid-engine car that was powered by a radical X-shaped aircraft type air-cooled two-stroke radial engine where the standard crankshaft was replaced by a unit called a Scotch yoke. While the GM car was fully tested, the Pontiac concept was not. Neither was placed in production.\n1970\u20131982.\nIncreasing insurance and fuel costs for owners decreased demand for muscle cars, along with federal emissions and safety regulations, put an end to the unrestricted, powerful engines of the 1960s. Safety, luxury, and economy would become the new watchwords of this decade. Engine performance began declining in 1971 when GM mandated that all engines be capable of using lower-octane unleaded gasoline, which led to drops in compression ratios, along with performance and fuel economy. This, coupled with trying to build cars as plush as GM's more luxurious Buicks and Oldsmobiles, contributed to the start of Pontiac's slow decline from its late-1960s highs.\nIn mid-1971 Pontiac introduced the compact, budget-priced Ventura II (based on the third generation Chevrolet Nova). This same year, Pontiac completely revamped its full-size car lineup. The flagship Bonneville was replaced with the more opulent Grand Ville, while a new generation of full-size Safari station wagons was introduced. These wagons featured a new tailgate known as a 'Clamshell' design; rather than swing upward or outward, the steel portion of the tailgate lowered into the body below the cargo floor and the rear window raised into the roof. The design featured a power-operated glass and either a manual or power-assist tailgate. The power tailgate, the first in station wagon history, ultimately supplanted the manual tailgate, which required marked effort to lift from storage.\nThe 1972 models saw the first wave of emissions reduction and safety equipment and updates. GTO was a now sub-series of the LeMans. The Tempest was discontinued, after being renamed 'T-37' and 'GT-37' for 1971. The base 1972 mid-sized Pontiac was now called LeMans. James MacDonald left the post of general manager to be replaced by Martin J. Caserio in late 1972. Caserio was the first manager in over a decade to be more focused on marketing and sales than on performance.\nFor 1973, Pontiac followed suit with the rest of the General Motors divisions and introduced their variants of the all-new GM \"A\" body, known as the 'Colonnade' style due to the roof treatment's pillared look. \"A\" body Pontiac models included the mid-sized LeMans and all-new Grand Am as part of the LeMans line. The compact Ventura and personal-luxury Grand Prix were also restyled for 1973. Other models, including the big cars and Firebirds, received only minor updates.\nAgain, power dropped across all engines as more emissions requirements came into effect. The 1973 Firebird Trans Am's factory-applied hood decal, a John Schinella stylized interpretation of Native American bird designs, took up most of the available space on the hood. Also in 1973, the new Super Duty 455 engine (\"Super Duty\" harkening back to Pontiac's Racing Engines) was introduced. Although it was originally to be available in GTOs and Firebirds, only a few SD 455 engines made it into Firebird Trans Ams that year. One so equipped was tested by \"Car and Driver\" magazine, which proclaimed it the last of the fast cars. The SD 455 was available for one more year in the Trans Am.\nAs emissions regulations were increasing, two of the three iterations of the engine were discontinued after 1974, with the final version of the 455 remaining available through 1976.\nFor 1975, Pontiac introduced the new sub-compact Astre, a version of the Chevrolet Vega. This was the brand's entry into the fuel economy segment of the market. Astre had been sold exclusively in Canada since 1973. It was offered through the 1977 model year. 1975 would also be the end of Pontiac convertibles for the next decade.\nThe 1976 models were the last of the traditional American large cars powered by mostly big-block V8 engines. After this year, all GM full-size models would go through \"downsizing\" and shrink in length, width, weight, and available engine size. The 1976 Sunbird, based on the Chevrolet Vega and Monza's equivalent, joined the line. It was first offered as a Notchback, with a Hatchback body style added in 1977. The Vega Wagon body style was added in 1978, Sunbird Safari Wagon, replacing the Astre Safari Wagon. The Sunbird was offered in its rear-wheel-drive configuration through the 1980 model year. (Sunbird Safari wagon through 1979.)\nFor the 1977 model year, the full-sized Pontiacs received the same \"downsizing\" as GM's other \"B\" body cars. The Grand Ville was dropped, but the new Bonnevilles and Catalinas continued to be best-sellers, although their styling shared more similarity to the Chevrolet Caprice than ever before.\nIn mid-year 1977, Pontiac introduced the Phoenix, an upscale version of the Ventura which replaced the Ventura entirely after the end of the 1977 model year. Pontiac also introduced its \"Iron Duke\" 4-cylinder overhead valve engine. It was first used in the 1977 Astre, replacing Astre's aluminum-block Vega engine. The 'Iron Duke' engine would later go into many GM and non-GM automobiles into the early 1990s. The 151 cubic inch I4 and the V8 were the last two engines designed solely by Pontiac. Subsequent engine design would be accomplished by one central office with all designs being shared by each brand.\nThe remainder of the 1970s and the early 1980s saw luxury, safety, and economy becoming ever-more important selling points in Pontiac products. Wire-spoked wheel covers returned for the first time since the 1930s. More station wagons than ever were being offered. Padded vinyl roofs were options on almost every model. Rear-wheel drive began its slow demise with the introduction of the first front-wheel drive Pontiac, the 1980 Phoenix (a version of the Chevrolet Citation).\nThe Firebird was successfully marketed by product placement in the 'Smokey and the Bandit' film and The Rockford Files TV show. The Firebird was available with Formula and Trans Am packages, and a turbocharged V8\u2014a Pontiac first\u2014was also available for the 1980 and 1981 model years.\n1982\u20131988.\nIntroduced in 1982, the wedge-shaped Firebird was introduced, marking the first major redesign of the pony car since 1970. Embedded marketing in the television series Knight Rider was successful. Pontiac introduced more performance-oriented models over the next decade. The Trans Am also set a production aerodynamic mark of .32\u00a0cd. A convertible body style was reintroduced after nine years. GM adapted the J-body cars and the all-new 1982 J2000 (later renamed Sunbird) had a convertible as part of its line.\nThe 1984 Fiero was a major departure from anything Pontiac had produced in the past. A two-seat, mid-engined coupe. The Fiero was partially responsible for Pontiac seeing its first increase in sales in four years. Pontiac also began to focus on technology. In 1984, a Special Touring Edition (STE) was added to the 6000 line as a competitor to European road cars such as the Mercedes 190. The STE sported digital instruments and other electronics as well as a more powerful V6 and retuned suspension. Later iterations would see some of the first introductions on Pontiacs of anti-lock brakes, steering wheel-mounted radio controls, and other features.\nPontiac imported the Canadian market Pontiac Parisienne, which featured the Bonneville's deluxe trim. This car, although a Pontiac in name, was no more than a slightly re-trimmed Caprice. The Parisienne sold in profitable numbers and this car continued in production until 1986 for the sedan, and 1989 for the Safari station wagon.\nWith the exception of the Parisienne Safari, the Firebird, and Fiero, beginning in 1988 all Pontiacs, with the exception of the Firebird, switched to front-wheel drive platforms. For the first time since 1970, Pontiac was the number three domestic car maker in America. The median age of Pontiac owners dropped from 46 in 1981 to 38 in 1988.\n1989\u20131997.\nPontiacs introduction included anti-lock brakes, GM's Quad-4 engine, airbags, and composite materials. Safari station wagon production ended in 1989, the last V8-powered full-sized, rear-wheel drive Pontiac until the 2009 G8. The 1990 model year saw the launch of Pontiac's first minivan and light truck, the Trans Sport. In addition, the Grand Prix line added its first-ever 4-door model, offered in LE and STE trims. At the end of the 1991 model year, the 6000 was discontinued in favor of the newly expanded Grand Prix lineup and the new Trans Sport minivan, which replaced the 6000 station wagon.\nIn 1992, a brand-new Bonneville was introduced. This full-size model featured aerodynamic styling, large expanses of curved glass, front-wheel drive, and the 3800 Series I V6 as standard equipment. A new sub-model, the SSEi, was introduced in 1992 carrying all standard equipment from the SSE model, plus the 205\u00a0hp supercharged 3800 V6. For 1993, the Bonneville added a new option package (H4U) called the Sport Luxury Edition (SLE), which was available on the SE model. This package included leather bucket seats, a specific grille, side trim, exhaust, dash trim, lace-styled alloy wheels, as well as a rear spoiler, sport handling suspension systems, and anti-lock brakes.\nAn all-new Firebird was introduced in 1993. It was powered by either a 3.4 L V6 with , or in Trans Am guise a LT-1, a V8, and could be backed by a T-56 six-speed manual. The Sunbird was replaced with the (still J-body) Sunfire in 1995. While a V6 engine was no longer available in the J-car, sedan, coupe, and convertible body styles did survive. For 1996 the Bonneville received updated front and rear fascias along with several other enhancements. The 3800 Series II V6 had become standard in 1995, featuring 205\u00a0hp. The updated supercharged 3800 Series II was now rated at 240\u00a0hp.\nDivision Sales Figures\n1997\u20132004.\nThe 1996 model year was the last year for the fifth-generation Grand Prix. The Grand Prix debuted in 1997 with the \"Wider is Better\" advertising campaign. The GTP trim level was added to the Grand Prix. It featured a supercharged 3.8 L V6 rated at and of torque. One design highlight of this generation Grand Prix is the sharing of the roof's sheet metal between both coupe and sedan models.\nIn 1998 the Firebird was updated. The TransAm received the LS-1 engine which produced . The WS6 option saw this number increase to and the addition of Ram Air and stiffer springs. The 1999 model year saw the replacement of the Trans Sport with the larger Montana minivan.\nIn 2000, the Bonneville received the first major redesign since 1992 and was based on the G-Body, shared with the Oldsmobile Aurora and Buick LeSabre. In 2001 Pontiac introduced the Aztek into the emerging SUV market segment.\nIn 2002, both the Firebird/Trans Am and Camaro were discontinued as a result of declining sales and a saturated sports market. The coupe version of the Grand Prix was also discontinued. The 2003 Vibe arrived in spring 2002, a Toyota-based compact wagon built at the NUMMI joint-venture plant. Also, in 2003, it was announced that the Grand Prix would be in the last year of its generation, with an improved seventh generation on the way for 2004. It would also be Pontiac's final year in NASCAR. Pontiac's final victory in the NASCAR Cup Series would be achieved by Ricky Craven in one of the closest finishes in NASCAR history, with David Green scoring their last second-tier series win at the Mr. Goodcents 300 at Kansas Speedway. A few surplus Pontiacs continued running in the Busch Series through 2005, in the ARCA Racing Series through 2007, with factory support in the NASCAR Canadian Tire Series from 2007 to 2009, and in the NASCAR Whelen Modified Tour as late as 2016, six years after the marque went defunct; Pontiac cars can still be found in local and regional stock car leagues.\nThe 2004 model year saw the reintroduction of the Pontiac GTO (based on the Australian-developed Holden Monaro). The GTO was also initially powered by the LS-1 V8 in its first model year. It had an independent front and rear suspension and an upscale full leather interior. Sales did not reach the 18,000 units that GM predicted. The LS1 engine was dropped in 2004. Pontiac added the drive-by-wire LS2 V8 for the 2005 and 2006 model years at no additional cost. Additional upgrades also consisted of stainless steel dual exhaust outlets, larger Corvette-sourced PBR brakes with EBD, larger front vented rotors with vented rear rotors, and functional heat extractor hood scoops. The Bonneville introduced the GXP trim level to replace the SSEi. The Bonneville GXP featured a 4.6 Northstar V8, borrowed from Cadillac, and replaced the Supercharged 3800 Series II. The redesigned Grand Prix made its appearance and featured a GT and GTP trim level. The GTP's new 3.8 L supercharged V6 now made , up 20 from the previous generation. TAPshift was also introduced as well as a Competition Group package (Comp G).\n2005\u20132010.\nWhile Oldsmobile was discontinued in 2004, Pontiac underwent a complete product revamping. The Grand Am was replaced with the mid-size G6 in 2005. The Grand Am was produced for the 2005 model year to fill the gap until the new G6 coupe and convertible became available for that model year. Production of the Bonneville officially ended in 2005 after nearly fifty years of production. Although not directly replaced, the RWD G8 introduced for the 2008 model year filled some market segments. The Solstice concept shown in 2002 was approved for production as a roadster (2006-2009), and, for a few months, 1,266 coupes (2009) were built in Wilmington, Delaware, before the end of Pontiac. In contrast, over 64,000 Solstice Convertibles were manufactured on that same line. The controversial Aztek was phased out and replaced by the Torrent, which was identical to the Chevrolet Equinox.\nIn 2005, the Sunfire was discontinued and replaced by the new Pontiac Pursuit (later named G5 for the American market). Initially, Pontiac did not plan on offering the G5 in the United States; however, dealer pressure to fill the gap left by the discontinuation of the Sunfire caused Pontiac to introduce only the coupe variation into the U.S. The four-door sedan version was available in Canada as the Pursuit throughout the model run. The high-performance GXP trim was introduced in the Grand Prix line in 2005, adding GM's LS4 V8 rated at and of torque. This engine was built to give buyers a V8 sedan option until the all-new G8 arrived in 2008. In 2008, the Grand Prix ended production, and the launch of the Australian-built RWD G8 commenced. The G8 gained positive reception for its high performance and low costs. Many noted the G8 as the poor man's BMW M5 due to its similar performance at a much lower price. The G8 GXP was the most powerful production car Pontiac had ever built and is regarded as the best driver's car ever to wear the Pontiac badge. The Holden Ute was scheduled to launch as the G8 ST before being canceled in January 2009 due to GM's financial situation. It was later announced that the G8 may not see a second generation. Towards the end of the decade, many rumors began spreading that Pontiac would become reliant on RWD. Reports ranged from a compact sedan based on the Alpha platform to a new RWD G6 for the 2013 model year. Many reports suggested that the Trans Am/Firebird would return after GM confirmed the rebirth of the Camaro. However, no official company statements confirmed these.\nOn December 2, 2008, General Motors eliminated numerous brands, including Pontiac, to appease Congress with the objective of receiving a $25 billion loan from the government. On February 17, 2009, GM proposed the sale or elimination of its Saturn division, the sale of Saab, and either the sale or elimination of Hummer, depending on whether a buyer could be found quickly. GM clarified that Pontiac would have begun to focus on \"niche\" models aimed at the \"youthful and sporty\" segment, but did not provide specifics. Pontiac was to trim its number of models to four. However, there were discussions of retaining only one model. By April 2009, several automotive websites and business publications were reporting that GM was doing a study suggesting it might eliminate the brand, along with sister truck brand GMC. On April 23, a report was published stating the company dropped the Pontiac brand while preserving the GMC truck line, and the Chevrolet, Cadillac, and Buick brands. The decision to dissolve Pontiac was made primarily due to the increasing threat of a bankruptcy filing if the June 1 deadline could not be met. The company dropped the Pontiac automobile and phased out all of its remaining models in 2010. Though both production and franchise agreements ended in 2010, Pontiac remains a registered and active trademark of GM for licensing purposes.\nGeneral Motors would eliminate an additional 7,000 to 8,000 factory jobs in the United States and shed 2,600 dealers by 2010 under a revised business plan. GM Chief Executive Officer Fritz Henderson said the Pontiac brand would be closed by 2010, calling it an \"extremely personal decision\". In addition to speeding up decisions on Saturn, Saab, and Hummer, GM would be left with four brands\u2014Chevrolet, Buick, GMC, and Cadillac.\nIn early May 2009, Jim Waldron, a Davison, Michigan, Pontiac dealer, announced his interest in purchasing the Pontiac brand and logos. He had found financing to buy them along with some soon-to-be shuttered GM plants to build cars. However, GM had already decided to retire the brand as it has begun to sell off its remaining inventory and said that, unlike Saturn, Hummer, and Saab, Pontiac was not for sale.\nThe Pontiac brand was pulled after the 2009 model year in Mexico and the brand was renamed Matiz, selling only one vehicle, the Matiz G2 (Matiz's logo is similar to Pontiac's).\nThe last Pontiac, a white 2010 model year G6 four-door sedan, was built at the Orion Township Assembly Line in January 2010. It now resides at the Pontiac Transportation Museum in Pontiac, Michigan.\nPontiac was one of three brands GM discontinued in 2010; the other two were Hummer and Saturn.\nStyle trademarks and logo.\nA Native American headdress was used as a logo until 1956. This was updated to the Native American red arrowhead design for 1957 for the remainder of the brand's run in all usage except the high-beam indicator lamp, which retained the original logo through 1970. The arrowhead logo is also known as the Dart.\nBesides the logo, another identifying feature of Pontiacs was their \"Silver Streaks\"\u2014one or more narrow strips of stainless steel which extended from the grille down the center of the hood. Eventually, they extended from the rear window to the rear bumper as well, and finally; along the tops of the fins. Although initially a single band, this stylistic trademark doubled to two for 1955 and 1956. The Streaks were discontinued the same year as the Indian Head emblems (1957).\nOne long-familiar styling element was the split-grille design which was introduced in 1959 to complement the make's new \"wide track\" stance. The 1960 models, however, reverted to the full-width grille styling. The split grille then returned for the 1961 model year and would remain as the marque's trademark. Other styling cues were the pointed \"arrowhead\" nose (in the 1960s and 1970s), and \"grilled-over\" (in the 1960s), or multiple horizontal-striped taillights. This later feature originated with the 1963 Grand Prix, and although the 1962 Grand Prix also had rear grillework, the taillight lenses were not behind it. Less longstanding but equally memorable is the \"cladding\" common on the doors and fenders of Pontiacs produced in the 1990s and 2000s. Rather than minimizing the side bumper, Pontiac designers put two troughs going along the length. Bumpers with this appearance were found on nearly all Pontiacs until the arrival of the G6. From 2004 onwards, new Pontiacs had cleaner, more premium styling, but retained the traditional split grille.\nName controversy.\nThe name \"Pontiac\" had come from the Odawa leader who had fought against the British for Fort Detroit in the 18th century. As mentioned above, GM would incorporate Native American imagery into Pontiac and would use Native American names for its cars on the brand. However, there was never controversy during the brand's lifespan.\nAlthough GM had already discontinued the Pontiac brand, the fact that GM had used the name gained some controversy in 2021 when the Cherokee Nation asked Jeep to rename its popular Jeep Cherokee and Grand Cherokee vehicles. In its statement, the Cherokee Nation cited GM's use of Pontiac as well as the RV manufacturer Winnebago Industries as other examples of Native American names being used on vehicles.\nCanadian/export models.\nPontiacs were built in Canada by Canadians in GM Canada with Canadian raw materials beginning in 1926, with factories in Oshawa, Ontario, and Regina, Saskatchewan. The models they produced were largely the same as their American counterparts. Canadian cars had Canadian oak in the bodies, not peach wood like the U.S. cars. The first significantly different model was the \"224\", introduced in 1937 with a Canadian-built version of the then-new . After 1940 the Pontiac Flathead Six was used, but otherwise, the Canadian Pontiacs shared chassis and body parts with the Chevrolets as a measure to reduce the cost of production for the relatively small Canadian market.\nAfter the Second World War, the Pontiac brand continued to be very popular, and the product line was further harmonized with the Canadian Chevrolet products. In the late 1940s and early 1950s, the U.S. market embraced eight-cylinder engines and Pontiacs equipped with the straight-eight engine were popular, but in Canada, the straight-six continued to be the popular offering. Beginning in 1953 the model lineup consisted of the base \"Pathfinder\", mid-range \"Pathfinder Deluxe\", and top-of-the-line \"Laurentian\". The chassis was shared with the Chevrolet, and the interiors were a combination of Chevy and Pontiac parts.\nBy 1955, the U.S. and Canadian Pontiac lines had diverged almost completely, with the US models positioned as \"mid-market\" cars available exclusively with the new Pontiac V8, while in Canada the brand was still positioned as an entry-level marque. The Canadian dealership lines were either Chevrolet-Oldsmobile-Cadillac or Pontiac-Buick-GMC; small towns usually had only one or the other, but not both, so it was imperative to keep Pontiac prices competitive with Plymouth and Ford (and Chevrolet). Producing two entirely separate engine series would have increased costs, so the Chevrolet straight-six replaced the Pontiac Flathead Six, and the new Chevrolet V8 replaced the old Pontiac straight-eight.\nIn 1958, the \"Strato-Chief\" replaced the \"Pathfinder Deluxe\", and in 1959 the line was reorganized with \"Laurentian\" in mid-range and the new \"Parisienne\" inserted at the top (similar to the U.S. market Bonneville). Even after the Canadian market was opened by the signing of the 1965 Autopact the Canadian full-sized Pontiac lineup\u2014and the practice of building them on Chevrolet chassis with Chevrolet engines\u2014continued mostly unchanged into the 1980s (although the Strato-Chief was dropped in 1970).\nGM Canada also built right-hand drive versions of their Pontiacs for export to Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa as knock-down kits until the late 1960s. The interiors of these cars more closely resembled the equivalent Chevrolets than the Canadian market cars did, as the Chevys had already been designed for right-hand drive.\nWhen the compact Chevrolet Corvair and Pontiac Tempest were introduced in 1960 the Corvair was built in Canada, but the Tempest was not. Importing the Tempest into Canada from the United States was not a viable option as the duties that would have had to have been paid would have substantially increased the price of what was supposed to be the least-expensive Pontiac. Tentative plans to build a Pontiac version of the Corvair were scrapped when the more conventional Chevy II was introduced in late-1961. GM Canada developed a new brand exclusively for the Canadian market for their rebadged Chevy IIs, the Acadian. Acadians were sold alongside the rest of the Pontiac lineup at Pontiac-Buick-GMC dealerships until 1971. When the mid-sized Chevrolet Chevelle was introduced in 1964 it was sold in Canada as the Acadian Beaumont ('Beaumont' was formerly the top-level trim of Chevy II-based Acadian), and in 1966 Beaumont became its own marque. The Beaumont-badged Chevelles were in production in Canada until 1969.\nEven after the 1965 Autopact (and Canada\u2013United States Free Trade Agreement that replaced it in 1988), the practice of building Pontiac-badged Chevrolets for sale at Canadian dealers continued until the brand was discontinued in 2010. Such cars include the Astre (based on the Vega), the Acadian (based on the Chevette), the Sunburst (based on the Spectrum), the Firefly (based on the Sprint), the Tempest (based on the Corsica), the Sunrunner (based on the Tracker), the Pursuit (based on the Cobalt; later badged as the \"G5 Pursuit\" and simply \"G5\"), and the Wave (based on the Aveo; later badged the \"G3 Wave\" and \"G3\").\nEngines.\nPontiac engineer Clayton Leach designed the stamped steel valvetrain rocker arm, a simplified and reliable alternative to a bearing-equipped rocker. This design was subsequently picked up by nearly every OHV engine manufacturer at one point or another.\nPontiac began work on a V8 configuration in 1946. This was initially intended to be an L-head engine, and 8 experimental units were built and extensively tested by the end of the 1940s. But testing comparisons to the OHV Oldsmobile V8 revealed the L-head could not compete performance-wise. So, in addition to building a new Pontiac Engineering building in 1949\u20131951, the decision to re-direct the V8 to an OHV design delayed its introduction until the 1953 model year, however, the Buick division was introducing its new engine (Nail valve V-8) in 1953 and asked the corporation to hold back or delay Pontiac's V8 introduction until the 1955 model year which it did.\nIn mid-1956, Pontiac introduced a higher-powered version of its V8. Among other things, this version of the engine was equipped with a high-performance racing camshaft and dual 4-barrel carburetors. This was the first in a series of NASCAR-ready pre- Super-Duty V8 engines and introduced the long line of multi-carburetor-equipped engines that saw Pontiac become a major player during the muscle car and pony car era of the 1960s. The enlarged 1956 Pontiac V8 found its way into light-duty GMC pickup trucks.\nPontiac's second-generation V8 engines shared numerous similarities, allowing many parts to interchange from its advent in 1959 to its discontinuation in 1979. Displacement ranged from . The similarity of the engines (except for the 301 &amp; 265 versions) makes rebuilding these engines relatively easier. This feature also made it possible for Pontiac to develop the modern muscle car, by the relatively simple process of placing its second largest-displacement engine, the into its mid-size car, the Le Mans, making the Pontiac LeMans GTO.\nFrom their inception in the 1950s until the early 1970s, Pontiac engines were known for their performance. The V8 was the largest and available in most Pontiacs except in the compact-size cars. At the height of the horsepower era, Pontiac engines reached ratings of (SAE gross), though other engines achieved considerably higher outputs. Federal emissions laws eventually brought the horsepower era to a close and resulted in a steady decline for Pontiac's engines. One holdout to this industry-wide slide was the Super Duty 455 engine of 1973\u20131974. Available only in the Firebird Formula and Trans Am models, this was rated at net initially but after having issues passing EPA emissions tests, the camshaft was changed to the old RA III cam, and with the change came a net rating. The engine was the pinnacle of Pontiac engine development and was a strong performer that included a few race-specific features, such as provisions for dry-sump oiling.\nThe only non-traditional Pontiac V8 engines were the and the . Produced from 1977 through 1981, these engines had the distinction of being the last V8s produced by Pontiac; GM merged its various brands' engines into one collectively shared group in 1980, entitled General Motors Powertrain. The 301 had a bore and stroke, identical to the version of the Chevrolet small-block engine and Ford Boss 302 engine.\nPontiac engines were not available in Canada however, but were replaced with Chevrolet engines of similar size and power, resulting in such models as the Beaumont SD-396 with a Chevrolet big-block V8.\nCarburetors.\nPontiac used Carter 1-barrel carburetors for many years but, by the time of the second generation, the V8 engines had switched mostly to 2-barrel offerings. These also were the basis for the Tri-Power setups on the engines.\nThe Tri-Power setup included one center carburetor with idle control and two end carburetors that did not contribute until the throttle was opened more than halfway. This was accomplished two ways, mechanically for the manual transmission models, and via a vacuum switch on the automatics. This went through various permutations as it was only a factory-installed option from 1957 through 1966.\nPontiac also had a square-bore 4-barrel at the time, but this was rated at lower horsepower than the Tri-Power. This carburetor was later replaced by the Quadrajet, a spread bore. The term \"Spread-bore\" signifies the difference in sizes between the primaries and secondaries, using smaller primaries paired with larger secondaries for increased airflow at wider throttle with fuel delivery changes akin to the two-plus-four benefit of Tri-Power but with a single carburetor. The Quadrajet was not the only thing that gave the top GTO 400 engine and the 428 H-O engines the same horsepower as the 389 and 421. The new engine had redesigned cylinder heads with different valve angles and larger ports that allowed for larger diameter intake and exhaust valves.\nBy the end of the muscle car era, the Quadrajet setup had become common on Pontiac engines. The Quadrajet design continued until 1990 for Oldsmobile V8 applications, with added computer controls to meet emissions and fuel economy standards.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Others, such as World Taekwondo, portray Choi as either an unimportant or a dishonorable figure in taekwondo history because of his defection to North Korea, whether by omitting him from their versions of taekwondo history or through explicit statements, due to the aforementioned controversy.\nEarly life.\nChoi was born on 9 November 1918 in Hwadae, Meigawa-gun, Kanky\u014dhoku Province, Korea, Empire of Japan (now Myongchon County, North Hamgyong Province, North Korea). Choi originally claimed that his father sent him to study calligraphy under Han Il-dong, who was also \"a master of taekkyon, the ancient Korean art of foot fighting\". He later recanted this story and said that he never studied taekkyeon and that it had nothing to contribute to taekwondo. Choi travelled to Japan, where he studied English, mathematics, and karate. In Kyoto, he met a fellow Korean with the surname Kim, who was a karate instructor and taught Choi this martial art. Choi also claimed to have learned Shotokan karate under Funakoshi Gichin. Just before he had left Korea, Choi apparently had a disagreement with a wrestler named Hu, and the possibility of a future confrontation inspired him to train; in his own words, \"I would imagine that these were the techniques I would use to defend myself against the wrestler, Mr. Hu, if he did attempt to carry out his promise to tear me limb from limb when I eventually returned to Korea\". Choi attained the rank of 1st \"dan\" in karate in 1939, and then 2nd \"dan\" soon after.\nMilitary career.\nChoi was enlisted into the Japanese army during World War II, later stating that he had been forced to serve. He wrote that he was imprisoned for attempting to escape and, in June 1945, was sentenced to seven years for conspiracy by a Japanese Military Court for his involvement in a rebellion. Following the war, in January 1946, Choi was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Korean army. From 1946 to 1951, Choi received promotions to first lieutenant, captain, major, lieutenant colonel, colonel, and then brigadier general. Choi was promoted to major general in 1954.\nTaekwondo.\nChoi combined elements of Oh Do Kwan Karate and Tang Soo Do to develop a style of the martial art known as \"Taekwondo\"; his organization spelt it Taekwon-Do, (; ), which means \"foot, fist, art\" or \"the way of hand and foot\" and it was so named on 11 April 1955. Choi co-founded the Oh Do Kwan, and was made an honorary director and given an honorary 5th \"dan\" ranking in the Chung Do Kwan. Due to accusations of dishonesty, Choi was stripped of his rank and position in the Chung Do Kwan.\nChoi, together with other Korean martial arts instructors, was a major contributor to the global expansion of taekwondo. ITF taekwondo organizations credit Choi with starting the spread of taekwondo internationally by stationing Korean taekwondo instructors around the world, and have consistently claimed that ITF-style taekwondo is the only authentic style of taekwondo, most notably in early sections of its textbooks. He was also the author of the first English taekwondo syllabus book, \"Taekwon-Do\", published by Daeha Publication Company in 1965. In 1972, Choi went into exile in Canada after the South Korean government refused to allow his organisation to teach taekwondo in North Korea, and the South Korea government formed the World Taekwondo Federation (WTF) in 1973 (renamed to WT in 2018). In 1979 he traveled and defected to North Korea where he was welcomed by the government and supported in his project of spreading Taekwondo to the world.\nDeath.\nChoi died of cancer on 15 June 2002 in Pyongyang, North Korea, where he received a state funeral in the Patriotic Martyrs' Cemetery. On his funeral committee were:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nChoi is listed in the Taekwondo Hall of Fame with various titles: \"Father of Taekwon-Do,\" \"Founder and First President of the International Taekwon-Do Federation,\" and \"Founder of Oh Do Kwan.\" Choi is survived by his wife, Choi Joon-hee; his son, Choi Jung-hwa; two daughters, Sunny and Meeyun; and several grandchildren.\nExplanatory notes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\na. The spelling of \"taekwondo\" varies widely in English usage. The WT and affiliated organizations typically use \"taekwondo,\" while the ITF and affiliated organizations typically use \"taekwon-do\" (as Choi used this spelling). In Wikipedia, the default spelling is \"taekwondo.\" This article follows this standard, but uses \"taekwon-do\" when referring specifically to the ITF or affiliated organizations' names.\nb. In Park's (1993) article, the note on Choi's promotion to 2nd \"dan\" in karate is followed by a note about the outbreak of World War II, which would suggest that Choi's 2nd \"dan\" promotion occurred no later than the early stages of that conflict (\"c.\" 1939\u20131940).\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "76174", "revid": "2927383", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=76174", "title": "Universal quantification", "text": "Mathematical use of \"for all\"\nIn mathematical logic, a universal quantification is a type of quantifier, a logical constant which is interpreted as \"given any\", \"for all\", \"for every\", or \"given an arbitrary element\". It expresses that a predicate can be satisfied by every member of a domain of discourse. In other words, it is the predication of a property or relation to every member of the domain. It asserts that a predicate within the scope of a universal quantifier is true of every value of a predicate variable.\nIt is usually denoted by the turned A (\u2200) logical operator symbol, which, when used together with a predicate variable, is called a universal quantifier (\"\u2200\"x\"\", \"\u2200(\"x\")\", or sometimes by \"(\"x\")\" alone). Universal quantification is distinct from \"existential\" quantification (\"there exists\"), which only asserts that the property or relation holds for at least one member of the domain.\nQuantification in general is covered in the article on quantification (logic). The universal quantifier is encoded as in Unicode, and as codice_1 in LaTeX and related formula editors.\nBasics.\nSuppose it is given that\n2\u00b70 = 0 + 0, and 2\u00b71 = 1 + 1, and 2\u00b72 = 2 + 2, ..., and 2 \u00b7 100 = 100 + 100, and ..., etc.\nThis would seem to be an infinite logical conjunction because of the repeated use of \"and\". However, the \"etc.\" cannot be interpreted as a conjunction in formal logic, Instead, the statement must be rephrased:\nFor all natural numbers \"n\", one has 2\u00b7\"n\" = \"n\" + \"n\".\nThis is a single statement using universal quantification.\nThis statement can be said to be more precise than the original one. While the \"etc.\" informally includes natural numbers, and nothing more, this was not rigorously given. In the universal quantification, on the other hand, the natural numbers are mentioned explicitly.\nThis particular example is true, because any natural number could be substituted for \"n\" and the statement \"2\u00b7\"n\" = \"n\" + \"n\"\" would be true. In contrast,\nFor all natural numbers \"n\", one has 2\u00b7\"n\" &gt; 2 + \"n\"\nis false, because if \"n\" is substituted with, for instance, 1, the statement \"2\u00b71 &gt; 2 + 1\" is false. It is immaterial that \"2\u00b7\"n\" &gt; 2 + \"n\"\" is true for \"most\" natural numbers \"n\": even the existence of a single counterexample is enough to prove the universal quantification false.\nOn the other hand,\nfor all composite numbers \"n\", one has 2\u00b7\"n\" &gt; 2 + \"n\"\nis true, because none of the counterexamples are composite numbers. This indicates the importance of the \"domain of discourse\", which specifies which values \"n\" can take. In particular, note that if the domain of discourse is restricted to consist only of those objects that satisfy a certain predicate, then for universal quantification this requires a logical conditional. For example,\nFor all composite numbers \"n\", one has 2\u00b7\"n\" &gt; 2 + \"n\"\nis logically equivalent to\nFor all natural numbers \"n\", if \"n\" is composite, then 2\u00b7\"n\" &gt; 2 + \"n\".\nHere the \"if ... then\" construction indicates the logical conditional.\nNotation.\nIn symbolic logic, the universal quantifier symbol formula_1 (a turned\u00a0\"A\" in a sans-serif font, Unicode\u00a0U+2200) is used to indicate universal quantification. It was first used in this way by Gerhard Gentzen in 1935, by analogy with Giuseppe Peano's formula_2 (turned E) notation for existential quantification and the later use of Peano's notation by Bertrand Russell.\nFor example, if \"P\"(\"n\") is the predicate \"2\u00b7\"n\" &gt; 2 + \"n\"\" and N is the set of natural numbers, then\n formula_3\nis the (false) statement\n\"for all natural numbers \"n\", one has 2\u00b7\"n\" &gt; 2 + \"n\".\nSimilarly, if \"Q\"(\"n\") is the predicate \"n\" is composite\", then\n formula_4\nis the (true) statement\n\"for all natural numbers \"n\", if \"n\" is composite, then 2\u00b7\"n\" &gt; 2 + n\".\nSeveral variations in the notation for quantification (which apply to all forms) can be found in the \"Quantifier\" article.\nProperties.\nNegation.\nThe negation of a universally quantified function is obtained by changing the universal quantifier into an existential quantifier and negating the quantified formula. That is, \nformula_5\nwhere formula_6 denotes negation.\nFor example, if \"P\"(\"x\") is the propositional function \"\"x\" is married\", then, for the set X of all living human beings, the universal quantification\nGiven any living person \"x\", that person is married\nis written\nformula_7\nThis statement is false. Truthfully, it is stated that\nIt is not the case that, given any living person \"x\", that person is married\nor, symbolically:\nformula_8.\nIf the function \"P\"(\"x\") is not true for \"every\" element of X, then there must be at least one element for which the statement is false. That is, the negation of formula_7 is logically equivalent to \"There exists a living person \"x\" who is not married\", or:\nformula_10\nIt is erroneous to confuse \"all persons are not married\" (i.e. \"there exists no person who is married\") with \"not all persons are married\" (i.e. \"there exists a person who is not married\"):\nformula_11\nOther connectives.\nThe universal (and existential) quantifier moves unchanged across the logical connectives \u2227, \u2228, \u2192, and \u219a, as long as the other operand is not affected; that is:\nformula_12\nConversely, for the logical connectives \u2191, \u2193, \u219b, and \u2190, the quantifiers flip:\nformula_13\nRules of inference.\nA rule of inference is a rule justifying a logical step from hypothesis to conclusion. There are several rules of inference which utilize the universal quantifier.\n\"Universal instantiation\" concludes that, if the propositional function is known to be universally true, then it must be true for any arbitrary element of the universe of discourse. Symbolically, this is represented as\nformula_14\nwhere \"c\" is a completely arbitrary element of the universe of discourse.\n\"Universal generalization\" concludes the propositional function must be universally true if it is true for any arbitrary element of the universe of discourse. Symbolically, for an arbitrary \"c\",\nformula_15\nThe element\u00a0\"c\" must be completely arbitrary; else, the logic does not follow: if \"c\" is not arbitrary, and is instead a specific element of the universe of discourse, then P(\"c\") only implies an existential quantification of the propositional function.\nThe empty set.\nBy convention, the formula formula_16 is always true, regardless of the formula \"P\"(\"x\"); see vacuous truth.\nUniversal closure.\nThe universal closure of a formula \u03c6 is the formula with no free variables obtained by adding a universal quantifier for every free variable in \u03c6. For example, the universal closure of\nformula_17\nis\nformula_18.\nAs adjoint.\nIn category theory and the theory of elementary topoi, the universal quantifier can be understood as the right adjoint of a functor between power sets, the inverse image functor of a function between sets; likewise, the existential quantifier is the left adjoint.\nFor a set formula_19, let formula_20 denote its powerset. For any function formula_21 between sets formula_19 and formula_23, there is an inverse image functor formula_24 between powersets, that takes subsets of the codomain of \"f\" back to subsets of its domain. The left adjoint of this functor is the existential quantifier formula_25 and the right adjoint is the universal quantifier formula_26.\nThat is, formula_27 is a functor that, for each subset formula_28, gives the subset formula_29 given by\nformula_30\nthose formula_31 in the image of formula_32 under formula_33. Similarly, the universal quantifier formula_34 is a functor that, for each subset formula_28, gives the subset formula_36 given by\nformula_37\nthose formula_31 whose preimage under formula_33 is contained in formula_32.\nThe more familiar form of the quantifiers as used in first-order logic is obtained by taking the function \"f\" to be the unique function formula_41 so that formula_42 is the two-element set holding the values true and false, a subset \"S\" is that subset for which the predicate formula_43 holds, and\nformula_44\nformula_45\nwhich is true if formula_32 is not empty, and\nformula_47\nwhich is false if S is not X.\nThe universal and existential quantifiers given above generalize to the presheaf category.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is often considered the opposite of shame and, depending on context, may be viewed as either a virtue or a vice. Typically, pride arises from praise, independent self-reflection, and/or a fulfilled feeling of belonging.\nThe word \"pride\" may refer to group identity. Manifestations include one's ethnicity. It is notably known for Black Pride, which gained historical momentum during the U.S. Civil Rights Movement. Then, it became known for independence struggles\u2014Feminist Pride, rooted in the women's rights movement with gender equality struggles and sexual identity (for example, Gay Pride or LGBT Pride, rising in visibility following the Stonewall riots). In this context of minority groups, the display of pride is in defiance of people outside of the minority in question trying to instill them with a sense of shame. There is also the sense of pride that can accompany national identity (patriotism), regional identity, or other affiliations (e.g. proud to be a university alumnus). In this context, the pride is more literal.\nIt may also refer to foolhardiness, or a corrupt, irrational sense of one's personal value, status, or accomplishments. In this sense, \"pride\" can be used synonymously with hubris or vanity. It has classical theological interpretation as one of the seven deadly sins. When viewed as a virtue, pride in one's abilities is known as virtuous pride, greatness of soul, or magnanimity, but when viewed as a vice, it is often known to be self-idolatry, sadistic contempt, or vainglory.\nEtymology.\nThe word \"proud\" originates from late Old English \"\", likely derived from the Old French meaning \"brave\" or \"valiant\" (11th century), which later became preux in French. This, in turn, comes from the Late Latin prodis, meaning \"useful,\" related to the Latin prodesse, \"to be of use.\" The sense of \"having a high opinion of oneself,\" which does not exist in French, may reflect the Anglo-Saxons' perception of the Norman knights, who referred to themselves as \"proud.\"\nAncient Greek philosophy.\nAristotle identified pride (, variously translated as proper pride, the greatness of soul and magnanimity) as the crown of the virtues, distinguishing it from vanity, temperance and humility, thus:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nHe then concludes that,\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;High-mindedness, then, seems to be the crowning grace, as it were, of the virtues; it makes them greater, and cannot exist without them. And on this account it is a hard thing to be truly high-minded; for it is impossible without the union of all the virtues.\nBy contrast, Aristotle defined the vice of hubris as follows:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;to cause shame to the victim, not in order that anything may happen to you, nor because anything has happened to you, but merely for your own gratification. Hubris is not the requital of past injuries; this is revenge. As for the pleasure in hubris, its cause is this: naive men think that by ill-treating others they make their own superiority the greater.\nThus, although pride and hubris are often deemed the same thing, for Aristotle and many philosophers hubris is an entirely different thing from pride.\nPsychology.\nPride, when classified as an emotion or passion, is both cognitive and evaluative; its object, that it cognizes and evaluates, is the self and its properties, or something the proud individual identifies with. The field of psychology classifies it with guilt and shame as a self-conscious emotion that results from the evaluations of oneself and one's behavior according to internal and external standards. Pride results from satisfying or conforming to a standard; guilt or shame from defying it.\nEmotion.\nIn psychological terms, positive pride is a \"pleasant, sometimes exhilarating, emotion that results from a positive self-evaluation.\" It was added to the University of California, Davis, \"Set of Emotion Expressions\", as one of three \"self-conscious\" emotions known to have recognizable expressions (along with embarrassment and shame).\nThe term \"\" was coined by Italian psychologist Isabella Poggi to describe the pride experienced and expressed in the moments following a personal triumph over adversity. Facial expressions and gestures that demonstrate pride can involve a lifting of the chin, smiles, or arms on hips to demonstrate victory. Individuals may implicitly grant status to others based solely on their expressions of pride, even in cases in which they wish to avoid doing so. Indeed, some studies indicate that the nonverbal expression of pride conveys a message that is automatically perceived by others about a person's high social status in a group.\nBehaviorally, pride can also be expressed by adopting an expanded posture in which the head is tilted back and the arms extended out from the body. This postural display is innate, as it is shown in congenitally blind individuals who have lacked the opportunity to see it in others.\nPositive outcomes.\nPride results from self-directed satisfaction with meeting personal goals; for example, positive performance outcomes elicit pride in a person when the event is appraised as having been caused by that person alone.\nPride as a display of the strong self that promotes feelings of similarity to strong others, as well as differentiation from weak others. Seen in this light, pride can be conceptualized as a hierarchy-enhancing emotion, as its experience and display helps rid negotiations of conflict.\nPride involves exhilarated pleasure and a feeling of accomplishment. It is related to \"more positive behaviors and outcomes in the area where the individual is proud.\" Pride is associated with positive social behaviors such as helping others and public expression of achievement. Along with hope, it is an emotion that facilitates performance attainment, as it can help trigger and sustain focused efforts, helping individuals prepare for upcoming evaluative events. It may also help enhance the quality and flexibility of the effort expended. Pride can enhance creativity, productivity, and altruism. Researchers have found that among African-American youth, pride is associated with a higher GPA in less socioeconomically advantaged neighborhoods, whereas in more advantaged neighborhoods, pride is associated with a lower GPA.\nEconomics.\nIn the field of economic psychology, pride is conceptualized on a spectrum ranging from \"proper pride,\" associated with genuine achievements, and \"false pride,\" which can be maladaptive or even pathological. Lea et al. examined the role of pride in various economic situations. They claim that . Understood in this way, pride is an emotional state that works to ensure that people take financial decisions that are in their long-term interests, even when in the short term they would appear irrational.\nSin and self-acceptance.\nInordinate self-esteem is called \"pride\". Classical Christian theology views pride as being the result of high self-esteem, and thus high self-esteem was viewed as the primary human problem, but beginning in the 20th century, \"humanistic psychology\" diagnosed the primary human problem as low self-esteem stemming from a lack of belief in one's \"true worth.\" Carl Rogers observed that most people \"regard themselves as worthless and unlovable.\" Thus, they lack self-esteem.\nIn the King James Bible, people exhibiting excess pride are labeled with the term, \"Haughty\".\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Pride goeth before destruction, and an haughty spirit before a fall.\u2014\u200a\nTerry Cooper describes excessive pride (along with low self-esteem) as an important framework in which to describe the human condition. He examines and compares the Augustinian-Niebuhrian conviction that pride is primary, the feminist concept of pride as being absent in the experience of women, the humanistic psychology position that pride does not adequately account for anyone's experience, and the humanistic psychology idea that if pride emerges, it is always a false front designed to protect an undervalued self.\nHe considers that the work of certain Neo-Freudian psychoanalysts, namely Karen Horney, and offers promise in addressing what he describes as a \"deadlock between the overvalued and undervalued self.\"\nCooper refers to their work in describing the connection between religious and psychological pride as well as sin to describe how a neurotic pride system underlies an appearance of self-contempt and low self-esteem:\nThe \"idealized self,\" the \"tyranny of the should,\" the \"pride system,\" and the nature of self-hate all point toward the intertwined relationship between neurotic pride and self-contempt. Understanding how a neurotic pride system underlies an appearance of self-contempt and low self-esteem.\nThus, hubris, which is an exaggerated form of self-esteem, is sometimes actually a lie used to cover the lack of self-esteem the hubristic person feels deep down.\nHubris and group narcissism.\nHubris is associated with more intra-individual negative outcomes and expressions of aggression and hostility. Hubris is not necessarily associated with high self-esteem but with highly fluctuating or variable self-esteem. Excessive feelings of hubris tend to create conflict and sometimes to terminate close relationships, which has led it to be understood as one of the few emotions with no clear positive or adaptive functions.\nA group that boasts, gloats, or denigrates others tends to become a group with low social status or to be vulnerable to threats from other groups. \"[H]ubristic, pompous displays of group pride might be a sign of group insecurity rather than a sign of strength,\" while those who express pride by being filled with humility whilst focusing on members' efforts and hard work tend to achieve high social standing in both the adult public and personal eyes.\nResearch from the University of Sydney found that hubristic pride correlates with arrogance and self-aggrandizement, and promotes prejudice and discrimination. But authentic pride is associated with self-confidence and accomplishment and promotes more positive attitudes toward outgroups and stigmatized individuals.\nEthnic.\nAcross the world.\nPride in one's own ethnicity or ones own culture seems to universally have positive connotations, though like earlier discussions on pride, when pride tips into hubris, people have been known to commit atrocities.\nTypes of pride across the world seem to have a broad variety. The difference of type may have no greater contrast than that between the U.S. and China. In the U.S., individual pride tends to be more important than national / ethnic pride, and seems to be held more often in thought. The people in China seem to hold greater importance for the nation as a whole.\nThe value of pride in the individual or the society as a whole seems to be a running theme and debate among cultures. This debate shadows the discussion on pride so much so that perhaps the discussion on pride should not be about whether pride is necessarily good or bad, but about which form of it is the most useful.\nPride has gained a lot of negative recognition in the western cultures, largely due to its status as one of the Seven Deadly Sins. It was popularized by the Pope Gregory I of the Catholic Church in the late sixth century, but before that it was recognized by a Christian Monk named Evagrius Ponticus in the fourth century as one of the evils human beings should resist.\nGerman.\nIn Germany, \"national pride\" (\"\") is often associated with Nazism. Strong displays of national pride are therefore considered to be in poor taste by many Germans. There is an ongoing public debate about the issue of German patriotism. The World Cup in 2006, held in Germany, saw a wave of patriotism sweep the country in a manner not seen for many years. Although many were hesitant to show such blatant support as the hanging of the national flag from windows, as the team progressed through the tournament, so too did the level of support across the nation.\nAsian.\nThe term \"Asian pride\" in modern usage refers mostly to those of East Asian descent, though it can include anyone of Asian descent. Asian pride was originally fragmented, as Asian nations have long had conflicts with each other; examples are the old Japanese and Chinese religious beliefs about their superiority. Asian pride emerged prominently during European colonialism. At one time, Europeans controlled 85% of the world's land through colonialism, resulting in anti-Western feelings among Asian nations. Today, some Asians still look upon European involvement in their affairs with suspicion. In contrast, Asian empires are proudly remembered by adherents of Asian Pride.\nBlack.\n\"Black pride\" is a slogan used primarily in the United States to raise awareness for a black racial identity. The slogan has been used by African Americans of sub-Saharan African origin or ancestry to denote a feeling of self-confidence, self-respect, celebrating one's heritage, and being proud of one's worth.\nWhite.\nWhite pride is a slogan mainly (but not exclusively) used by white separatist, white nationalist, neo-Nazi, and white supremacist organizations in the United States for a white race identity. White pride also consists of white ethnic/cultural pride.\nMad Pride.\nMad pride is a worldwide movement and philosophy that individuals with mental illnesses, disorders or difficulties should be proud of their 'madness'. The movement advocates for mutual support and rallies for the rights of individuals who define themselves as 'mad', and aims to popularize and destigmatize the word \"mad\" as a self-descriptor.\nLGBT Pride.\nLGBT pride is a worldwide movement which recognizes that lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ+) individuals should be proud of their sexual orientation and gender identity. LGBT pride includes advocacy for equal rights and benefits for LGBT people. The movement has three main premises: that people should be proud of their sexual orientation and gender identity; that sexual diversity is a gift; and that sexual orientation and gender identity are inherent and cannot be intentionally altered.\nThe word \"pride\" is used in this case as an antonym for \"shame.\" It is an affirmation of self and community. The modern gay pride movement began after the Stonewall riots\u2014the nearly week-long uprising between New York City youth and police officers following a raid of Stonewall Inn\u2014of the late 1960s. In June 1970, the first pride parade in the United States commemorated the one-year anniversary of the Stonewall riots. Today, there are pride parades and celebrations in many cities and towns throughout the world, and numerous countries recognize an annual Pride Month, most commonly in June.\nVanity.\nIn conventional parlance, vanity is sometimes used in a positive sense to refer to a rational concern for one's appearance, attractiveness, and dress, and is thus not the same as pride. It can also refer to an excessive or irrational belief in or concern with one's abilities or attractiveness in the eyes of others and may, in that sense, be compared to pride. The term \"vanity\" originates from the Latin word meaning \"emptiness\", \"untruthfulness\", \"futility\", \"foolishness\", and \"empty pride\". Here, \"empty pride\" means a fake pride, in the sense of vainglory, unjustified by one's own achievements and actions, but sought by pretense and appeals to superficial characteristics.\nIn many religions, vanity is considered a form of self-idolatry, in which one rejects God for the sake of one's own image, and thereby becomes divorced from the graces of God. The stories of Lucifer and Narcissus (who gave us the term narcissism), and others, attend to a pernicious aspect of vanity.\nIn Western art, vanity was often symbolized by a peacock, Biblical terms, and by the Whore of Babylon. During the Renaissance, it was invariably represented as a naked woman, sometimes seated or reclining on a couch. She attends to her hair with a comb and mirror. The mirror is sometimes held by a demon or a putto. Other symbols include jewels, gold coins, a purse, and Death himself.\nOften depicted is an inscription on a scroll that reads (\"All is Vanity\"), a quote from the Latin translation of the Book of Ecclesiastes. Although that phrase\u2014itself depicted in a type of still life called vanitas\u2014originally referred not to an obsession with one's appearance, but to the ultimate fruitlessness of man's efforts in this world, the phrase summarizes the complete preoccupation of the subject of the picture. \"The artist invites us to pay lip-service to condemning her\", writes Edwin Mullins, \"while offering us full permission to drool over her. She admires herself in the glass, while we treat the picture that purports to incriminate her as another kind of glass\u2014a window\u2014through which we peer and secretly desire her.\" The theme of the recumbent woman often merged artistically with the non-allegorical one of a reclining Venus.\nIn his table of the seven deadly sins, Hieronymus Bosch depicts a bourgeois woman admiring herself in a mirror held up by a devil. Behind her is an open jewelry box. A painting attributed to Nicolas Tournier, which hangs in the Ashmolean Museum, is \"An Allegory of Justice and Vanity\". A young woman holds a balance, symbolizing justice; she does not look at the mirror or the skull on the table before her. Vermeer's famous painting \"Girl with a Pearl Earring\" is sometimes believed to depict the sin of vanity, as the young girl has adorned herself before a glass without further positive allegorical attributes. \"All is Vanity\", by Charles Allan Gilbert (1873\u20131929), carries on this theme. An optical illusion, the painting depicts what appears to be a large grinning skull. Upon closer examination, it reveals itself to be a young woman gazing at her reflection in the mirror of her vanity table. Such artistic works served to warn viewers of the ephemeral nature of youthful beauty, as well as the brevity of human life and the inevitability of death.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Originally located in Hilversum, the company relocated to Trompenburg, Amsterdam in 1898.\nNotable products of Spyker were building the Golden Coach for state ceremonial use for the Dutch royalty in 1898. In 1903, the Spyker 60 HP race-car was the world's first F4 layout, four-wheel drive car, featuring the first application of a six-cylinder engine, as well as the first four-wheel braking system. The 1919 C1 \u201cAerocoque\u201d was one of the world's first cars with aerodynamically streamlined bodywork.\nHistory.\nIn 1880, Dutch brothers Hendrik Jan and Jacobus Spijker, blacksmiths by profession, start their company for building and maintaining carriages in Hilversum, The Netherlands.\nIn 1898, Spyker manufactured the \"Golden Coach\", still in use as one of the two prime ceremonial state coaches of the Dutch monarchy.\nIn 1899 they started building automobiles, and in 1900 put their first models on display, two-cylinder 3\u00a0hp and 5\u00a0hp similar to the Benz.\nFour-cylinder models were introduced in 1903, along with the six-cylinder \"Spyker 60 HP\", a racer which was the world's first ever four-wheel drive car with a single engine and four-wheel brakes. It was the first ever car built with front-engine, four-wheel-drive layout, and its engine with six cylinders was also a world's first.\nThe 1905 cars featured a round radiator grille, which became a feature of many of the pre war cars. In 1907, an 18\u00a0hp model competed in the 15,000\u00a0km Peking to Paris monster race, finishing second in the most grueling race of its time.\nHendrik-Jan Spijker died in 1907 on his return journey from England when the ferry he was on, the SS Berlin, sank, and this loss led to the bankruptcy of the original company. A group of investors bought the company and restarted production, but Jacobus Spijker was no longer involved.\nIn 1913, the company was having financial problems again, and in 1915 was taken over by new owners and renamed \"Nederlandsche Automobiel en Vliegtuigfabriek Trompenburg\" (Dutch Car and Aircraft company). Under the new owners, the previous complex model range was simplified and a new car, the 13/30 C1, introduced; sales were disappointing.\nIn 1914, Spyker merged with Dutch Aircraft Factory N.V. and the company motto became \"Nulla Tenaci invia est via\" latin for \"For the tenacious no road is impassable\". During World War I, in which the Netherlands were neutral, some 100 Spyker fighter aircraft and 200 aircraft engines were produced.\nIn 1919, after World War I, a two-seater car, the C1 \"Aerocoque\", featuring aerodynamically streamlined bodywork influenced by aircraft design, was shown for the first time. It was intended as a show car, but was also produced on a very limited scale. The car's bodywork, featuring swooping fenders and an aircraft-like tail, infused by the company's knowledge of aircraft aerodynamics, was mainly designed by Jaap Tjaarda van Sterkenburg, brother of John Tjaarda and uncle of Tom Tjaarda, both also car designers.\nOn November 27, 1920 the first Spyker 30/40HP C4 was completed, sporting a 6-cylinder Maybach engine of . The car was nicknamed \"Tenax\" (latin for \"tenacious\") and improved the long-distance endurance record, held since 1907 by the Rolls-Royce Silver Ghost by some 6,000\u00a0km. The C4 completed 30,360\u00a0km in the Dutch winter weather in just over a month.\nIn 1922, racing driver Selwyn Edge took to Brooklands in a Spyker C4 fitted with streamlined racing bodywork, setting a new \"Double 12\" average world speed record, covering 1,782 miles (2,868\u00a0km) at an average speed of for the 24 hour aggregate of two 12-hour periods.\nAlso in 1922, the company went bankrupt again and was acquired by Spyker's distributor in Britain, who renamed the company \"Spyker Automobielfabriek\". Production continued and prices dropped but the company continued to decline. Final production was of the C2 two-ton truck and the C4 car, which lasted until 1926 when funds finally ran out.\nIt is estimated total Spyker car production was at most 2000 cars.\nIn 1999, a new company, Spyker Cars, was founded, unrelated to the original company but for the brand name, motto and logo.\nLicense production and auto rental.\nBefore Hendrik-Jan Spijker's death, he and his brother had developed a special relationship with Dutch electrical pioneer, . The Spijker brothers had known Hofstede Crull already when he was a young man racing on the velocipede circuits in the Netherlands and in Germany while he was an engineering student first in Mittweida and later in Hannover at the Technische Hochschule in the 1880s. Hofstede Crull had already owned his first automobile in the 1890s. In the first decade, he had accumulated a collection of automobiles which included a number of the Spijker racing models. He housed the collection in one of the wings of the , one of the companies he had founded. Although this was all a hobby for him initially, he began assembling Spijkers at Heemaf with the approval of the Spijker brothers and subsequently with that of those who had taken over Spijker. He provided them with improvements on the automobiles. Heemaf's board of directors complained that Hofstede Crull was using a part of the factory as his personal garage and auto park. To circumvent the criticism, he established the \"Spijker Automobiel Verhuur Maatschappij\" which along with Amsterdam's \"Trompenburg Bedrijf\" became the first auto rental companies in the Netherlands. One of his other companies was the \"American Refined Motor Company\", which helped improve mechanical motor parts. This all stemmed from an automobile accident that he, Hofstede Crull, and his chauffeur, a man named Poorthuis, had in 1909 when he subsequently discovered a defect in the Spijker's steering mechanism which he improved.\nSpyker on stamps and in film.\nBoth Spyker brand automobiles appear on Dutch postage stamps (first day of issue: May 10, 2004).\nThe car driven by Kenneth More in the 1953 film \"Genevieve\", about the London to Brighton Veteran Car Run, is a 1905 Spyker 12/16-HP Double Phaeton. The green-coloured vehicle was repainted yellow twice, first for the movie and again for the 2023 Run to commemorate the 70th anniversary of its cinematic release.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

At the 2020 census, the population was 228,996. The county seat is Barnstable. The county consists of Cape Cod and associated islands (some adjacent islands are in Dukes County and Nantucket County). Barnstable County was formed as part of the Plymouth Colony on June 2, 1685, including the towns of Falmouth, Sandwich, and others to the east and north on Cape Cod. Plymouth Colony was merged into the Province of Massachusetts Bay in 1691.\nHistory.\nGiovanni da Verrazzano.\nCape Cod is described in a letter from the Italian explorer Giovanni da Verrazzano to Francis I of France, relating the details of a voyage to the New World made on behalf of the French crown in the ship Dauphine, the only surviving of a fleet of four. Sailing from Madeira in 1524, the Dauphine made land in North Carolina in March. It sailed north to Newfoundland, mapping the coast and interviewing the natives, whom he found friendly south of the cape, but unfriendly north of it. To the north of an island that reminded Verrazzano of Rhodes, the Dauphine made its way with difficulty over shoals \"never less than three feet deep\" extending \"from the continent fifty leagues out to sea,\" which Brevoort, based on their extent, has identified as Nantucket Shoals. Verrazzano called them Armellini. On the other side was a promontory, Pallavisino, which is probably the cape, as they sailed along it for \"fifty leagues.\" Details of the north end are not given, but subsequently they came to a \"high country, full of very dense forests, composed of pines,\" which, according to Brevoort and others, resembles the coast of Maine.\nBartholomew Gosnold.\nAfter Verrazzano, what is now the eastern United States acquired the map label of New France, but France had no way to develop it. Scattered colonies in the wilderness of a few dozen men could not be supported until the foundation of Quebec in 1608. Meanwhile, the paper claim did not deter entrepreneurs. In March 1602, Bartholomew Gosnold set sail from Falmouth, Cornwall, in the ship, Concord, transporting a crew of eight, an exploration party of 12, and 20 colonists, with the intent of establishing a trading post in the New World. Intersecting the coast of Maine, they turned to the south, encountered what appeared to be an island, and dropped anchor in Provincetown Harbor. Gosnold at first called the land Shoal Hope, but after discovering it was a cape, and acquiring a hold full of cod from the abundant schools in Cape Cod Bay, he changed the name to Cape Cod.\nGosnold explored the cape, establishing good relations with the natives there, approximately 1500 members of the Nauset Tribe, closely related in language and custom to the Wampanoag people of the mainland, and under their sovereignty. John Brereton, chaplain of the expedition, reported that they were dark-skinned, customarily nude except for deerskins over the shoulders and sealskins around the waist, and wore their long, black hair up in a knot. They painted their bodies. Some knew a few English words, which is something of a historical problem, as Gosnold and his companions are believed to have been the first English to land in America. Gosnold made a point of describing how healthy the people appeared.\nSubsequently, Gosnold sailed around the cape to discover an island, \"full of wood, vines, gooseberry bushes, whortleberries, raspberries, eglantines, etc.,\" as well as large numbers of shore birds. He named it Martha's Vineyard after his daughter. Another island nearby, Cuttyhunk Island, he named Elizabeth Island, in honor of Elizabeth I of England, from which the Elizabeth Islands take their name. He intended to place a trading post there, but when the time came for the return voyage, the colonists decided not to remain. Gosnold ventured a second time to the New World in 1608 as Captain John Smith's second in command of the Jamestown expedition. After three months there, he died of malaria.\nMartin Pring.\nIn 1603, another mercantile expedition set sail from Bristol, England, in two ships, the \"Speedwell\" and the \"Discoverer\", commanded by a 23-year-old captain, Martin Pring. Elizabeth I had died two weeks earlier, but Pring had secured permission from Sir Walter Raleigh, who held from the queen exploration rights to all of North America.\nGeography.\nAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (70%) is water. It is the second largest county in Massachusetts by total area. It has about of shoreline.\nBarnstable County is not co-extensive with Cape Cod. The latter is a geophysical place defined by its insular or peninsular landmass. According to Freeman, it is a \"long, irregular peninsula\" between , measured along the north or the south shores respectively, and between wide. Originally, only the tip was considered the cape, but as it was settled the name extended from its tip to the shortest line across the isthmus. Barnstable County, on the other hand, is a geopolitical and legal entity. It is the area contained within the borders of all cities and towns defined to be in the county by the Massachusetts General Court. These borders were decided in episodes of disputed legislation during the centuries since the founding of Plymouth Colony.\nThe main difference between Cape Cod and Barnstable County is the band of water up to several miles wide extending from the shoreline to the outermost county border. The offshore area contains significant maritime life, is a recreational and transport medium, and contains historical material lost in shipwrecks.\nThe highest elevation in the county is , at the summit of Pine Hill, on Joint Base Cape Cod, in Bourne. The lowest point is sea level.\nAdjacent counties.\nBarnstable County borders Plymouth County to the northwest; off Barnstable County's southern shore are Dukes County and Nantucket County.\nDemographics.\nBarnstable County is one of the oldest in the country, ranking in the top ten for highest median age (among those with at least 100,000 residents). The median age is 55 years old as of 2020 (whereas the median in the U.S. is 39 years old).

The county voted for Republican presidential candidates in every election from 1876 to 1992, with the exception of 1912 (when the Progressive candidate won the county) and 1964. It has since come to favor the Democratic Party, supporting Democratic candidates in all presidential elections since 1992. \nDespite Barnstable's safe Democratic swing federally, it remained competitive well into the 21st century, with Republicans and Democrats frequently trading control of the county council and county positions and Republicans dominating local elections. The shift of the national Republican Party, in addition to the disorganization of the state Republican Party, has allowed Democrats to slowly make inroads in the county. The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic has been cited as an accelerant of that effect, with left-leaning remote workers moving into the county from places like Boston and New York City, and Barnstable County is now predominantly Democratic at the local level as well. Despite this, Barnstable still remains the Republican Party's strongest county in terms of voter registration, although, like Democrats, they are dwarfed by registered Independents.\nGovernment.\nBarnstable County is one of the last functioning counties in Massachusetts. County government consists of a legislative branch (Barnstable County Assembly of Delegates) and an executive branch (Barnstable County Commissioners).\nBarnstable County Assembly of Delegates.\nThe Assembly of Delegates is the legislative branch of Barnstable County. There are 15 towns in Barnstable County, each town represented on the Assembly. In 1989, by an Act of the Massachusetts General Court and confirmed by most Barnstable County voters, the Barnstable County Home Rule Charter went into effect and the first session of the Assembly of Delegates convened. All legislative powers of the county are vested in the Assembly, which acts by ordinance and adopts resolutions.\nThe Assembly of Delegates consists of 15 delegates, one representing each of the towns in Barnstable County. A delegate's vote is weighted on the basis of the population of his or her town. The town of Barnstable, for example, has the largest share of the vote, at 20.92%, and Truro has the smallest, at 0.93%.\nBarnstable County Commissioners.\nThere are three Barnstable County Commissioners, who together act as the Executive Branch of county government. Each commissioner is elected at large and serves a four-year staggered term. The commissioners direct county agencies, prepare budgets to submit to the Assembly, oversee the care of county property and finances, propose ordinances to the Assembly, and appoint the County Administrator.\nRonald Bergstrom (D-Chatham), Chair\nSheila Lyons (D-Wellfleet), Vice-chair\nMark Forest (D-Yarmouth), Commissioner\nCape Cod Commission.\nThe planning agency of Barnstable County is the Cape Cod Commission.\nCommunities.\nCities and towns have been legally incorporated as such under the laws of the State of Massachusetts. They include the entire territory of the state. A city may continue to name itself a town even though legally a city. Villages are subordinate to cities or towns. In addition to and not necessarily based on these legal municipalities are the arbitrary divisions of the United States Census Bureau. Villages are census divisions which may be used as special purpose municipalities or may have a greater sense of civic identity than their constituent town(s), but are not fully functioning municipal corporations. For example, the City of Barnstable has five fire districts that cover the seven villages - each village has its own fire department except that Centerville, Osterville and Marstons Mills have combined their efforts into the COMM Fire Department.\nTowns.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nVillages.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nCensus-designated places.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nUnincorporated communities.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nEducation.\nSchool districts include:\nOfficially K-12:\nSecondary:\nElementary:\nTruro residents are eligible to go to Nauset Regional High School, and formerly to Provincetown High.\nCape Cod Community College is in the county.\nEconomy.\nThe county is known for aquaculture.

Berkshire County government was abolished effective July 1, 2000. Most former county functions were assumed by state agencies, and there is no county council or commission. The sheriff became a Commonwealth employee, but remains locally elected to perform duties within the county region and retains administrative and operational control over the Berkshire Sheriff's Office, an independent state agency created after the county government was abolished. The Berkshire Sheriff's Office runs the county jail and house of correction.\nLocal communities were granted the right to form their own regional compacts for sharing services, and the towns of Berkshire County have formed such a regional compact known as the Berkshire Regional Planning Commission.\nBerkshire County has three Registry of Deeds Districts, one for each district.\nBerkshire County is in the congressional district, a primarily rural district that makes up most of Western Massachusetts.\nBerkshire County has three districts and elected Representatives in the Massachusetts House of Representatives.\nBerkshire County comprises only part of one district for the Massachusetts Senate due to its low population. The district consists of all 32 cities and towns in Berkshire County as well as the following 25 communities: Ashfield, Buckland, Charlemont, Colrain, Conway, Hawley, Heath, Monroe, Shelburne, Rowe and Whately, in the county of Franklin; Blandford, Chester, Granville, Southwick, and Tolland in the county of Hampden; Chesterfield, Cummington, Goshen, Huntington, Middlefield, Plainfield, Westhampton, Williamsburg and Worthington, in the county of Hampshire. Paul Mark (D) is the current Senator.\nThe Massachusetts Governor's Council, also known as the Executive Council, is composed of eight individuals elected from districts, and the Lt. Governor who serves ex officio. The eight councillors are elected from their respective districts every two years. Berkshire County is part of the 8th District.\nThe Council generally meets at noon on Wednesdays in its State House Chamber, next to the Governor's Office, to act on issues such as payments from the state treasury, criminal pardons and commutations, and approval of gubernatorial appointments such as judges, notaries and justices of the peace.\nSee also the https:// (more detailed and with map) and https:// (also useful).\nGeography.\nAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of of which is land and (2.1%) is water.

As of the 2020 census, the population was 579,200. The shire town is Taunton. Some governmental functions are performed by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, others by the county, and others by local towns and cities. The county is the sixth most populous county in Massachusetts. Bristol County is part of the Providence metropolitan area, which is also included in Greater Boston. The county is adjacent to the state of Rhode Island. It is geographically adjacent to the Massachusetts counties of Plymouth, Norfolk, and Dukes (via water), and the Rhode Island counties of Bristol, Newport, and Providence.\nHistory.\nBristol County was created by the Plymouth Colony on June 2, 1685, and named after its \"shire town\" (county seat), Bristol. The Plymouth Colony, along with the Massachusetts Bay Colony, the Maine Colony and several other small settlements were rechartered in 1691, by King William III, to become The Province of Massachusetts Bay.\nThe towns of Bristol, Barrington, and Warren were awarded to Rhode Island in 1746 as part of the settlement of a long-running boundary dispute (see History of Massachusetts), forming Bristol County, Rhode Island. At the same time, Cumberland, Rhode Island was carved out of Attleborough, Massachusetts and annexed to Providence County, Rhode Island; Tiverton and Little Compton were transferred to Newport County, Rhode Island. East Freetown was officially purchased by Freetown, Massachusetts, from Tiverton in 1747, and so remained on the Massachusetts side.\nAfter the departure of Bristol, Taunton was made the shire town of the county. A second county courthouse was constructed in 1828 in the growing town of New Bedford (designed a \"half-shire town\"). In 1862, a part of Seekonk (that portion of which is now East Providence, Rhode Island) and the entirety of East Pawtucket were transferred to Providence County, Rhode Island. At the same time, land ceded from Rhode Island was added to Fall River and Westport. The growing Fall River became the site of the third county courthouse in 1877.\nGeography.\nAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (20%) is water. The highest point in Bristol County is Sunrise Hill (Watery Hill) at above sea level located in World War I Memorial Park in North Attleborough. It is also to note that Bristol, Plymouth and Taunton are all places in South West England. Their Massachusetts cousins were named after the originals as South West England was the focal point for sailing and discovery at the time of America's discovery. John Cabot set sail from Bristol and sailed down the Severn on which lies Newport in Wales.\nAdjacent counties.\nTo the south, Dukes County is opposite Buzzards Bay from Bristol County.\nDemographics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"US Census population/styles.css\"/&gt;\n2000 census.\nAt the 2000 census there were 534,678 people, 205,411 households, and 140,706 families in the county.

At the 2020 census, the population was 20,600, making it the second-least populous county in Massachusetts. Its county seat is Edgartown.\nDukes County comprises the Vineyard Haven, MA Micropolitan Statistical Area. The county consists of 32 named islands, the largest of which is Martha's Vineyard. It also includes Chappaquiddick Island (sometimes peninsula of the Vineyard), the Elizabeth Islands, including Cuttyhunk, and Nomans Land.\nHistory.\nThe original inhabitants of the islands were Wampanoag, who had several villages. Political jurisdiction over the lands were granted by the English monarchy in overlapping claims to two different British nobles, from which Massachusetts Bay Company settler Thomas Mayhew purchased them in 1641. Mayhew established a colony in his new domain, carefully purchasing land ownership rights from the native inhabitants, and maintaining native governments to continue unimpeded. In 1665, Mayhew's lands were included in a grant to James, Duke of York (later King James II). In 1671, a settlement was arranged, allowing Mayhew to continue to rule while placing his territory under the jurisdiction of the Province of New York.\nDukes County was thus established as Dukes County, New York, on November 1, 1683, and included all of Mayhew's lands \u2013 Martha's Vineyard, Nantucket, and the Elizabeth Islands. The county was transferred to Massachusetts on October 7, 1691, and at the same time Nantucket Island was split into the separate Nantucket County, Massachusetts. The 1695 incorporation statute created a county \"by the name of Dukes County,\" as opposed to the standard form \"the county of Dukes\" which is the reason for the redundancy in the formal name, \"County of Dukes County\".\nGeography.\nAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (79%) is water.

At the 2020 census, the total population was 809,829, making it the third-most populous county in the state, and the seventy-eighth-most populous in the country. It is part of the Greater Boston area (the Boston\u2013Cambridge\u2013Newton, MA\u2013NH Metropolitan Statistical Area). The largest city in Essex County is Lynn. The county was named after the English county of Essex. \nThe county has two traditional county seats: Salem and Lawrence. Prior to the dissolution of the county government in 1999, Salem had jurisdiction over the Southern Essex District, and Lawrence had jurisdiction over the Northern Essex District, but currently these cities do not function as seats of government. However, the county and the districts remain as administrative regions recognized by various governmental agencies, which gathered vital statistics or disposed of judicial case loads under these geographic subdivisions, and are required to keep the records based on them. The county has been designated the Essex National Heritage Area by the National Park Service.\nHistory.\nThe county was created by the General Court of the Massachusetts Bay Colony on May 10, 1643, when it was ordered \"that the whole plantation within this jurisdiction be divided into four sheires\". Named after the county in England, Essex then comprised the towns of Salem, Lynn, Wenham, Ipswich, Rowley, Newbury, Gloucester and Andover. In 1680, Haverhill, Amesbury and Salisbury, located north of the Merrimack River, were annexed to Essex County. These communities had been part of Massachusetts' colonial-era Norfolk County (1643\u20131680). The remaining four towns within \"Old\" Norfolk County, which included Exeter and what is now Portsmouth, were transferred to the Province of New Hampshire. The Massachusetts-based settlements were then subdivided over the centuries to produce Essex County's modern composition of cities and towns.\nEssex County is where Elbridge Gerry (who was born and raised in Marblehead) created a legislative district in 1812 that gave rise to the word \"gerrymandering\".\nDue to a confluence of floods, hurricanes, and severe winter storms, Essex County has had more disaster declarations than most other U.S. counties, from 1964 to 2016.\nLaw and government.\nFrom the founding of the Republican Party until the New Deal, Essex County was a Republican stronghold in presidential elections. Since 1936, it has trended Democratic, with Dwight Eisenhower in 1952 and 1956 and Ronald Reagan in 1980 and 1984 being the only Republicans to carry the county since.\nLike several other Massachusetts counties, Essex County exists today only as a historical geographic region, and has no county government. All former county functions were assumed by state agencies in 1999. The sheriff (currently Kevin Coppinger), district attorney (currently Paul Tucker), and some other regional officials with specific duties are still elected locally to perform duties within the county region, but there is no county council, commissioner, or county employees. Communities are now granted the right to form their own regional compacts for sharing services.\nGeography.\nEssex County is roughly diamond-shaped and occupies the northeastern corner of the state of Massachusetts.\nAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (41%) is water. Essex County is adjacent to Rockingham County, New Hampshire to the north, the Atlantic Ocean (specifically the Gulf of Maine and Massachusetts Bay) to the east, Suffolk County to the south, Middlesex County to the west and a very small portion of Hillsborough County, New Hampshire to the far north west in Methuen. All county land is incorporated into towns or cities.\nEssex County includes the North Shore, Cape Ann, and the lower portions of the Merrimack Valley.\nAdjacent Counties\n\u2022 Middlesex County (west)\n\u2022 Suffolk County (south)\n\u2022 Hillsborough County, New Hampshire (northwest)\n\u2022 Rockingham County, New Hampshire (north)\nTransportation.\nThese routes pass through Essex County:\nThe Lawrence Municipal Airport and Beverly Municipal Airport are regional airports within the county; the nearest commercial airports are Logan Airport in Boston and Manchester-Boston Regional Airport in Manchester, NH.\nThe MBTA commuter rail has two lines operating in Essex County: the Haverhill Line and the Newburyport Line, both of which go toward Boston. Close to Boston, MBTA buses also exist. The MVRTA is a bus company that connects cities within the Merrimack Valley portion of Essex County.\nNational protected areas.\nBecause of Essex County's rich history, which includes 17th century colonial history, maritime history spanning its existence, and leadership in the expansions of the textile industry in the 19th century, the entire county has been designated the Essex National Heritage Area by the National Park Service.\nThe following areas of national significance have also been preserved:\nDemographics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"US Census population/styles.css\"/&gt;\nAs of the 2010 United States census, there were 743,159 people, 285,956 households, and 188,005 families residing in the county.

The heritage area consists of all of Essex County, MA a area between the Atlantic Coast and the Merrimack Valley. The area includes 34 cities and towns; two National Historic Sites (Salem Maritime National Historic Site and Saugus Iron Works National Historic Site); and thousands of historic sites and districts that illuminate colonial settlement, the development of the shoe and textile industries, and the growth and decline of the maritime industries, including fishing, privateering, and the China trade. The Essex National Heritage Area is one of 49 heritage areas designated by Congress, affiliated with the National Park Service.\nThe Essex National Heritage Commission is a non-profit organization chartered to promote tourism and cultural awareness of the area, connecting people to the places of Essex County, MA. The commission's mission is to promote and preserve the historic, cultural and natural resources of the ENHA by rallying community support around saving the character of the area. This is accomplished through the commission's projects and programs, which include Partnership Grant Program, Explorers membership program, photo safaris, and the annual September weekend event Trails &amp; Sails, as well as other important regional partnership building projects like the Essex Heritage Scenic Byway, and the Border to Boston trail.\nCommunities.\nThe towns and cities of Essex County are listed below.\nCities.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nTowns.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nCensus-designated places.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nOther villages.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Its most populous municipality is Amherst (due to seasonal student population; the largest year-round is Northampton, which is also its traditional county seat), and its largest town in terms of landmass is Belchertown. The county is named after the county Hampshire, in England. Hampshire County is part of the Springfield, MA Metropolitan Statistical Area. Together with Hampden County, Hampshire County municipalities belong to the Pioneer Valley Planning Commission.\nHistory.\nHampshire County was constituted in 1662 from previously unorganized territory comprising the entire western part of Massachusetts Bay Colony. It included the original towns of Springfield, Northampton, and Hadley. The original Hampshire County also included territory that is now in modern-day Hampden County, Franklin County, and Berkshire County, as well as small parts of modern-day Worcester County. By 1683, three new towns (Westfield (now Southwick), Suffield, and Enfield) had been incorporated south of Springfield. These towns were partly or wholly in the modern state of Connecticut at the time of their incorporation. They resulted in a border dispute between the Connecticut Colony and Massachusetts Bay Colony.\nIn 1731, Worcester County was created, which included the original town of Brookfield (incorporated in 1718 as part of Hampshire County). More territory was lost to Worcester County in 1742 when the town of Western (now Warren) was created and added to Worcester County. Further territorial losses occurred in 1749 when the towns of Enfield, Somers (split off from Enfield in 1734), and Suffield unilaterally joined Connecticut Colony. In 1761, Berkshire County was partitioned from Hampshire County. In 1811, Franklin County was split off from the northern part of Hampshire, and in the following year, Hampden County was split off from its southern part.\nFollowing the dissolution of the county government in 1999, county affairs were managed by the Hampshire Council of Governments. The council itself ceased operations in 2019, due to what an appraisal of the council termed a \"fundamentally flawed, unsustainable operational model\"; it had no inherent source of income and lacked a regional planning function.\nGeography.\nAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (3.3%) is water.\nHampshire County is the middle section of the Pioneer Valley and the northern tip of the Hartford\u2013Springfield Knowledge Corridor.\nAdjacent counties.\nHampshire County is the only county in Massachusetts surrounded in all directions by other counties of Massachusetts: all other counties in the state are adjacent to at least one other state or the open ocean.\nDemographics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"US Census population/styles.css\"/&gt;\n2000 census.\nAt the 2000 census there were 152,251 people, 55,991 households, and 33,818 families living in the county.

As of the 2020 census, the population was 1,632,002, making it the most populous county in both Massachusetts and New England and the 20th most populous county in the United States. This makes the county the most populous county on the East Coast outside of New York or Florida. Middlesex County is one of two U.S. counties (along with Santa Clara County, California) to be amongst the top 25 counties with the highest household income and the 25 most populated counties. It is included in the Census Bureau's Boston\u2013Cambridge\u2013Newton, MA\u2013NH Metropolitan Statistical Area. As part of the 2020 United States census, the Commonwealth's mean center of population for that year was geo-centered in Middlesex County, in the town of Natick (this is not to be confused with the geographic center of Massachusetts, which is in Rutland, Worcester County).\nOn July 11, 1997, Massachusetts abolished the executive government of Middlesex County primarily due to the county's insolvency. Middlesex County continues to exist as a geographic boundary and is used primarily as district jurisdictions within the court system and for other administrative purposes; for example, as an election district. The National Weather Service weather alerts (such as severe thunderstorm warning) continue to localize based on Massachusetts's counties.\nHistory.\nThe county was created by the Massachusetts General Court on May 10, 1643, when it was ordered that \"the whole plantation within this jurisdiction be divided into four shires.\" Middlesex initially contained Charlestown, Cambridge, Watertown, Sudbury, Concord, Woburn, Medford, and Reading. In 1649 the first Middlesex County Registry of Deeds was created in Cambridge.\nOn April 19, 1775, Middlesex was the site of the first armed conflict of the American Revolutionary War.\nIn 1855, the Massachusetts State Legislature created a minor Registry of Deeds for the Northern District of Middlesex County in Lowell.\nIn the late 19th century and early 20th century, Boston annexed several of its adjacent cities and towns including Charlestown and Brighton from Middlesex County, resulting in an enlargement and accretion toward Suffolk County.\nBeginning prior to the dissolution of the executive county government, the county comprised two regions with separate county seats for administrative purposes:\nSince the start of the 21st century, much of the current and former county offices have physically decentralized from the Cambridge seat, with the sole exceptions being the Registry of Deeds and the Middlesex Probate and Family Court, which both retain locations in Cambridge and Lowell. Since the first quarter of 2008, the Superior Courthouse has been seated in the city of Woburn; the Sheriff's Office is now administratively seated in the city of Medford and the Cambridge-based County Jail has since been amalgamated with another county jail facility in Billerica. The Cambridge District Court (which has jurisdiction for Arlington, Belmont and Cambridge); along with the Middlesex County District Attorney's Office, although not a part of the Middlesex County government, was also relatedly forced to relocate to Medford at the time of the closure of the Superior Courthouse building in Cambridge.\nGovernment and politics.\nOf the fourteen counties of Massachusetts, Middlesex is one of eight which have had no county government or county commissioners since July 1, 1998, when county functions were assumed by state agencies at local option following a change in state law. Immediately prior to its dissolution, the executive branch consisted of three County Commissioners elected at-large to staggered four-year terms. There was a County Treasurer elected to a six-year term. The county derived its revenue primarily from document filing fees at the Registries of Deeds and from a Deeds Excise Tax; also a transfer tax was assessed on the sale price of real estate and collected by the Registries of Deeds.\nBudgets as proposed by the County Commissioners were approved by a County Advisory Board that consisted of a single representative of each of the 54 cities and towns in Middlesex County. The votes of the individual members of the advisory board were weighted based on the overall valuation of property in their respective communities.\nThe County Sheriff and two Registers of Deeds (one for the Northern District at Lowell and another for the Southern District at Cambridge) are each elected to serve six-year terms. Besides the employees of the Sheriff's Office and the two Registries of Deeds, the county had a Maintenance Department, a Security Department, some administrative staff in the Treasurer's and Commissioners' Offices, and the employees of the hospital.\nThe county government also owned and operated the Superior Courthouse, one of which was formerly in Cambridge (since 2008 relocated to Woburn.) and one in Lowell; and the defunct Middlesex County Hospital in the city of Waltham.\nThe legislation abolishing the Middlesex County executive retained the Sheriff and Registers of Deeds as independently elected officials, and transferred the Sheriff's Office under the state Department of Public Safety and the two Registry of Deeds offices to the Massachusetts Secretary of State's Office. Additionally, all county maintenance and security employees were absorbed into the corresponding staffs of the Massachusetts Trial Court. The legislation also transferred ownership of the two Superior Courthouses to the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. The hospital was closed. Finally, the office of County Commissioner was immediately abolished and the office of County Treasurer was abolished as of December 31, 2002. Any county roads transferred to the Commonwealth as part of the dissolution. The other administrative duties (such as Sheriff, Department of Deeds and court system, etc.) and all supporting staff were transferred under the Commonwealth as well.\nAdministrative structure today.\nRecords of land ownership in Middlesex County continue to be maintained at the two Registries of Deeds. Besides the Sheriff and the two Registers of Deeds, the Middlesex District Attorney, the Middlesex Register of Probate and the Middlesex Clerk of Courts (which were already part of state government before the abolition of Middlesex County government) are all elected countywide to six-year terms.\nIn Middlesex County (as in the entirety of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts), the governmental functions such as property tax assessment and collection, public education, road repair and maintenance, and elections were all conducted at the municipal city and town level and not by the county government.\nIn 2012 the 22-story Superior Court Building in Cambridge which was transferred from the abolished Executive County government was sold by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Due to its transfer from state control, many local residents had tried to force the private developers to reduce the overall height of the structure.\nEven following the abolition of the executive branch for county government in Middlesex, communities are still granted a right by the Massachusetts state legislature to form their own regional compacts for sharing of services and costs thereof.\nGeography.\nAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (3.5%) is water. It is the third-largest county in Massachusetts by land area.\nIt is bounded southeast by the Charles River and drained by the Merrimack, Nashua, and Concord rivers, and other streams.\nThe MetroWest region comprises much of the southern portion of the county.\nTransportation.\nThese routes pass through Middlesex County\nDemographics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"US Census population/styles.css\"/&gt;\nIn 2006, Middlesex County contained the tenth most millionaires of any county in the United States.\nAs of the 2010 United States census, there were 1,503,085 people, 580,688 households, and 366,656 families residing in the county.

It formerly ran the Middlesex Jail in Cambridge, which closed on June 28, 2014. In addition, the Sheriff's Office operates the Office of Civil Process and, the Lowell Community Counseling Centers, and crime prevention and community service programs. The office of sheriff was created in 1692, making it one of the oldest law enforcement agencies in the United States. The sheriff is elected to a 6-year term.\nNotable sheriffs include:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nPolitics.\nPrior to 1960, Middlesex County was a Republican Party stronghold, backing only two Democratic Party presidential candidates from 1856 to 1956. From the 1960 election the trend reversed; the county has exclusively supported Democratic presidential candidates. This has intensified in recent decades, as George H. W. Bush in 1988 was the most recent Republican presidential candidate to receive over 40 percent of the county's votes and Mitt Romney in 2012 the last Republican to receive over 30 percent. In 2020, Joe Biden won 71% of the county\u2019s votes, the highest share for any presidential candidate since 1964.\nCommunities.\nMost municipalities in Middlesex County have a town form of government; the remainder are cities, and are so designated on this list.

At the 2020 census, the population was around 725,981. Its county seat is Dedham. The county was named after the English county of the same name. Two towns, Cohasset and Brookline, are exclaves. Norfolk County is included in the Boston-Cambridge-Newton, MA-NH Metropolitan Statistical Area. Norfolk County is the 24th highest-income county in the United States with a median household income of $107,361. It is the wealthiest county in Massachusetts.\nHistory.\nOne of the original counties of the Massachusetts Bay Colony created on May 10, 1643, was called Norfolk, and is unrelated to the current Norfolk County. It covered territory in what is now New Hampshire, and was abolished on September 18, 1679, when King Charles II separated the Colony of New Hampshire from Massachusetts.\nShortly after the Constitution of Massachusetts was adopted on October 25, 1780, a number of towns in Suffolk County, of which Dedham was then a part, elected delegates to a convention to decide upon some policy relative to the division of the county. The convention met at Gay's Tavern in Dedham on December 12, 1780, and adopted a resolution to the effect that the towns of Bellingham, Dedham, Foxborough, Franklin, Medfield, Medway, Needham, Stoughton, Stoughtonham, Walpole, and Wrentham, along with the Middlesex County towns of Holliston, Hopkinton, Natick, and Sherborn ought to be formed into a new county with Medfield as the shiretown. The Great and General Court did not look favorably upon the resolution, however, and no new county was then created.\nNorfolk County, Massachusetts was created on June 20, 1793. Legislation passed in March which separated off all the towns in Suffolk County except Boston and Chelsea (which at the time included what are now Revere and Winthrop). Dedham was designated as the \"shire town\". Hingham and Hull petitioned to remain in Suffolk County and on the day the law was to take effect, their removal to Norfolk County was repealed, making Cohasset an exclave. In 1803, they were moved into Plymouth County, Massachusetts.\nOn June 22, 1797, the town of Natick was given to Middlesex County, and the town of Needham was transferred from Middlesex to Norfolk. The towns of Dorchester and Roxbury were part of Norfolk County when it was created but, as Boston annexed each town in stages from 1804 to 1912, they became part of Suffolk County again, leaving Brookline separated from the rest of Norfolk County. No other changes have been made to the territory of Norfolk County, other than new municipalities being created within its boundaries, and minor border adjustments.\nNorfolk County is the birthplace of four Presidents of the United States (John Adams, John Quincy Adams, John F. Kennedy, and George H. W. Bush), resulting in the moniker \"County of Presidents.\"\nJails.\nFollowing the creation of the county, Gay's Tavern was the site of a Court of General Sessions on August 25, 1794. They ordered that the committee on buildings proceed with collecting materials for building a jail. On the last day of September following this order, the court accepted from Timothy Gay the gift of a parallelogram lot of land to erect the Norfolk County Jail next to his tavern.\nIt was replaced by a new Norfolk County Jail in 1817. The two story stone building was built in 1817 and was 33' square. Part of the jail was torn down in 1851 to erect a central, octagonal portion and two wings. It resulted in a building with the shape of a Latin cross, and featured Gothic Revival windows. The three tiers of cells radiated out like spokes from the central guardroom. There were two hangings in the central rotunda: George C. Hersey on August 8, 1862, and James H. Costley on June 25, 1875.\nInmates were housed in the jail until 1992 when the Norfolk County Correctional Center was opened in 1992. A court forced the closure after 13 inmates escaped in 1989. There were at least 27 break outs during the prison's history.\nThe current Norfolk County Correctional Center is located on the median of Route 128 in Dedham. The facility has 502 beds and opened in 1992.\nCourthouses.\nAfter the creation of the county, the Court of Common Pleas and the Court of General Sessions of the Peace first met in Dedham's meetinghouse. Nathaniel Ames was chosen as the clerk of both and they met for the first time on September 23.\nWhen the court met on January 7, 1794, it was so cold in the building, which lacked any sort of heating, that they moved to the Woodward Tavern across the street. The Anglican Church in town had also offered their building, but it was in such a state of disrepair that the offer was not accepted. The First Church and Parish in Dedham then offered a piece of land on their Little Common, and a new courthouse was ordered to be constructed. Construction was sluggish, however, and the delays frustrated Ames.\nThe court was still sitting in the meetinghouse in 1794 but the new courthouse was completed in 1795. It was found to be too small, however, and the ceilings were so low as to stifle people in the courtrooms. Charles Bulfinch was hired in 1795 to design a turret for the building and Paul Revere was commissioned to cast a bell.\nWhen it became apparent that the Courthouse was out of date, the County Commissioners ordered a new one to be built. They originally were seeking a utilitarian building that would be fireproof and safe to store important documents. Local boosters, however, wanted a building that aligned with the town's rapidly improving self-image.\nThe land for the courthouse, across the street from the existing one, was purchased from Frances Ames for $1,200. Ames later refused to sell the lot to the east at an asking price of $400, however. Masonic ceremonies, bell ringing and cannon fire accompanied the laying of the cornerstone on July 4, 1825. In 1827, the old courthouse was sold at public auction.\nThe new building was designed by Solomon Willard and was dedicated on February 20, 1827. It was a basic rectangular granite-walled structure, 48' by 98' and two stories tall, with Greek-temple porticoes at either end. Each 10' portico was supported by four Doric pillars. A bell made by Paul Revere was moved from the old courthouse to the new north portico, where it was tolled to announce court sessions.\nThe interior had a hall running through the center paved with brick. On the eastern side were the offices of the Country Treasurer and the Clerk of Courts. On the western side were the Registry of Deeds and Probate Court. The courtroom was upstairs and featured an arched ceiling. The high sheriff had a desk in the room.\nFrom the outside it was an attractive building, but it was not a comfortable place to work. The only water was provided by a well on Court Street, and it did not have an adequate heating system. One employee complained that it was \"barren and destitute of every convenience, demanded for health, comfort and decency.\" In 1846, an iron fence was installed around the perimeter.\nRegistry of Deeds.\nThe Registry was originally housed in one of the first floor rooms of the home of Eliphalet Pond, the first registrar, at 963 Washington Street in Dedham. A sign was nailed to a tree out front informing the public of its location. It then moved to the original Norfolk County Courthouse and remained there for about three decades. When the new Norfolk County Courthouse was built in 1827, the middle office on the west side of the lower level was used by the Registry. When the population of the county grew and the number of real estate transactions increased apace, a new building was constructed for the Registry across the street at 649 High Street. The Boston firm Peabody &amp; Stearns was hired to design the current Registry of Deeds, built in 1905. The main section of the building measures 52 feet by 186 feet, is two stories high with a copper hipped roof, and is built of Indiana limestone with details made of granite from Deer Isle, Maine.\nGeography.\nAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (11%) is water. It is the third-smallest county in Massachusetts by total area. The county is not completely contiguous; the towns of Brookline and Cohasset are each part of Norfolk County but are separated from the majority of Norfolk County (and each other) by either water or other counties. At the county's formation, Hingham and Hull were to be part of it, but joined Plymouth County instead, leaving Cohasset as the initial exclave of Norfolk County and an enclave of Plymouth County. Brookline became the second exclave of Norfolk County in 1873 when the neighboring town of West Roxbury was annexed by Boston (thus leaving Norfolk County to join Suffolk County) and Brookline refused to be annexed by Boston after the Brookline-Boston annexation debate of 1873.\nMajor highways.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nDemographics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"US Census population/styles.css\"/&gt;\n2000 census.\nAt the 2000 census there were 650,308 people, 248,827 households, and 165,967 families residing in the county.

As of the 2020 census, the population was 797,936, making it the fourth-most populous county in Massachusetts. The county comprises the cities of Boston, Chelsea, and Revere, and the town of Winthrop. The traditional county seat is Boston, the state capital and the largest city in Massachusetts. The county government was abolished in 1999, resulting in Suffolk County now functioning only as an administrative subdivision of state government and a set of communities grouped together for some statistical purposes. Suffolk County is located at the core of the Boston-Cambridge-Newton, MA-NH Metropolitan Statistical Area as well as the greater Boston-Worcester-Providence, MA-RI-NH-CT Combined Statistical Area.\nHistory.\nThe county was created by the Massachusetts General Court on May 10, 1643, when it was ordered \"that the whole plantation within this jurisdiction be divided into four shires\". Suffolk initially contained Boston, Roxbury, Dorchester, Dedham, Braintree, Weymouth, Hingham and Hull. The county was named after Suffolk, England, which means \"southern folk.\"\nIn 1731, the extreme western portions of Suffolk County, which included Mendon and Uxbridge, were split off to become part of Worcester County. In 1793, most of the original Suffolk County split off and became Norfolk County, leaving only Boston, Chelsea, Hingham, and Hull in Suffolk. Hingham and Hull would leave Suffolk County and join Plymouth County in 1803. Revere was set off from Chelsea and incorporated in 1846 and Winthrop was set off from Revere and incorporated in 1852. In the late 19th century and early 20th century, Boston annexed several adjacent cities and towns including Hyde Park, Roxbury, West Roxbury, and Dorchester from Norfolk County and Charlestown and Brighton from Middlesex County, resulting in an enlargement of Suffolk County.\nDuring the early 20th century, County government functions were absorbed by the City of Boston, with Boston City Council becoming the de-facto County Commission, and the City Treasurer similarly becoming the County Treasurer, albeit said government was not formally abolished until 1999.\nGovernment and politics.\nLike an increasing number of Massachusetts counties, Suffolk County exists today only as a historical geographic region, and has no county government. All former county functions were assumed by state agencies in 1999. The sheriff, district attorney, and some other regional officials with specific duties are still elected locally to perform duties within the county region, but there is no county council, executives or commissioners. Prior to the abolition of county government, the authority of the Suffolk County Commission had for many years been exercised by the Boston City Council, even though three communities in the county are not part of the city. However, communities are now granted the right to form their own regional compacts for sharing services.\nPolitically speaking, Suffolk County supports the Democratic Party overwhelmingly. No Republican presidential candidate has won there since Calvin Coolidge in 1924. In 2012 Barack Obama received 77.4% of the vote, compared to 20.8% for former governor of Massachusetts Mitt Romney. In the 2014 gubernatorial election, Martha Coakley carried the county by a 32.4% margin, while losing the election statewide by 48.4 to 46.5%. In 2020, Joe Biden won the county by the largest margin of any presidential candidate since Lyndon B. Johnson in 1964, and was the first candidate since then to win more than 80% of the vote in the county.\nSheriff's department.\nThe Suffolk County Sheriff's Department's primary responsibility is oversight of the Nashua Street Jail and the South Bay House of Correction. These were built in the 1990s to replace the historic Charles Street Jail and Deer Island Prison, respectively. The Suffolk County Sheriff's Department was among those named in a 2020 WBUR report about the neglect of inmates with medical conditions in Massachusetts prisons leading to their deaths.\nSeveral notable figures in Massachusetts history were once the sheriff of Suffolk County:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nGeography.\nAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (52%) is water.

At the 2020 census, the population was 862,111, making it the second-most populous county in Massachusetts. Being 1,510.6 square miles of land area, it is the largest county in Massachusetts by geographic area. The largest city and traditional shire town is Worcester. Worcester County is part of the Worcester, MA\u2013CT metropolitan statistical area and the Boston-Worcester-Providence combined statistical area.\nHistory.\nWorcester County was formed from the eastern portion of colonial Hampshire County, the western portion of the original Middlesex County and the extreme western portion of the original Suffolk County. When the government of Worcester County was established on April 2, 1731, Worcester was chosen as its shire town (later known as a county seat). From that date until the dissolution of the county government, it was the only county seat. Because of the size of the county, there were fifteen attempts over 140 years to split the county into two counties, but without success.\nInitially, Lancaster was proposed as the seat of the northern county; later, Petersham was proposed once and Fitchburg was proposed repeatedly, most recently in 1903. Perhaps as a concession, in August 1884 the Worcester County Registry of Deeds was split in two, with the Worcester Northern registry placed in Fitchburg.\nGeography.\nAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (4.3%) is water.\nIt is the largest county in Massachusetts by area.

The county has an elected county sheriff, county prosecutor, and court officials, administered under the state department of public safety. The state correctional system in the county is known as the Worcester County Jail or \"House of Corrections\" at West Boylston, and the Worcester County District courts (state administered) are housed at Worcester, Fitchburg, and other district courts within county boundaries. The Worcester County district attorney is a county-wide position even though the district includes one town from a neighboring county. In Massachusetts, Sheriffs have more limited roles than most states and are responsible for corrections, court service and bailiffs and jail release programs. County Sheriffs in Massachusetts are elected to six-year terms. The Worcester County Sheriff is Lewis Evangelidis (R), and the Worcester County District Attorney is Joseph Early Jr. (D) (see the info-box for elected officials at county level). The Worcester County Conservation District has countywide boundaries. The county has a regional planning commission.\nMassachusetts law allows regional compacts, traditional counties and other governmental entities. Traditional County governments in the state include Norfolk, Bristol, Dukes, Nantucket, and Plymouth Counties. Barnstable County, which is Cape Cod, functions as a modern regional county government. Suffolk County, which is mainly Boston, is under the Boston City Council. The Massachusetts General Laws describe this relationship of county government and the options for abolishing county governments and/or chartering regional governmental compacts in subchapter 34 B. Four other new county compacts have been created by the state legislature in Hampshire, Franklin, Barnstable Counties, and a regional planning council level for Berkshire County. Thus 9 of 14 Counties have some form of county regional governments. Worcester County could exercise that option if it chooses, such as for public safety and/or preparedness due to its rather large geography, by a request to and a special act of the legislature, by local referendum, or by one of three mechanisms.

The river widens at this place, later becoming a bay that discharges into the Atlantic Ocean and is often nicknamed \"Bas-du-Fleuve\" (Lower-River). The region is formed by eight regional county municipalities and 114 municipalities. In the south, it borders the US state of Maine, the Canadian province of New Brunswick and the Quebec administrative regions of Chaudi\u00e8re-Appalaches and Gasp\u00e9sie\u2013\u00celes-de-la-Madeleine.\nIt had a population of 199,039 and a land area of as of the 2021 census.\nThe territory has evidence of human occupation since the Pleistocene by successive indigenous peoples. The historic First Nations occupied it all until European colonisation started in the late 17th century; France made land concessions to settlers under the Seigneurial system of New France to encourage colonization. However, development of this region was slow until it started to exploit its mixed forests. Settlement gradually developed further inland, on the littoral, and since the late 20th century a leisure and recreation industry has developed.\nIts geography is marked by the Saint Lawrence River to the northwest, the Notre Dame Mountains section of the Appalachians, as well as the Matap\u00e9dia and T\u00e9miscouata valleys, which forms the natural communication corridors with the Gasp\u00e9 Peninsula, the state of Maine in the United States, and the Maritimes.\nEtymology and toponymy.\nThe region takes its name from the Saint Lawrence River, a waterway that has a central role in the history of Quebec and forms the northern border of the region. The name of the river, and by extension the region, has a hagiotoponymic origin originating from the \"baye sainct Laurens\" named by Jacques Cartier, originating from the date of discovery being 10 August 1535, day of the festival of Saint Lawrence in the Christian martyrology. The name of the bay was used again to describe the river when the \"Narration\", his report of his expedition, was translated to Spanish and Italian, and definitively fixed by its use in the world map of cartographer Gerardus Mercator in 1569, according to historian Marcel Trudel.\nThe name \"Bas-Saint-Laurent\", however, only appeared much later. In their \"Histoire du Bas-Saint-Laurent\", the historians Fortin and Lechasseur assert that the relation with the Saint Lawrence grew with the population of the region in the 19th century. The first mention of the name is attributed to a report from the Rimouskois deputy and writer Joseph-Charles Tach\u00e9, which used the term to describe \"the two shores of the Bas-Saint-Laurent except the Gasp\u00e9 district\". The authors, however, write that Tach\u00e9 preferred most of the time to use more precise and well-known references, like the counties of Montmorency and Rimouski.\nEven if the name of the region was present on a map made in 1863 by Stanislas Drapeau, it took time to settle in; the expression \"le Bas du Fleuve\" being preferred.\nWith the settlement of T\u00e9miscouata and la Matap\u00e9dia, the name start imposing itself between 1920 and 1960, when a number of enterprises and organisms of the region delimitated by the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Rimouski and Rivi\u00e8re-du-Loup, like the \"Compagnie de transport du Bas St-Laurent\" and the \"Compagnie de Pouvoir du Bas-Saint-Laurent\" or the newspaper \"l'\u00c9cho du Bas St-Laurent\" adopt it.\nAfter being eclipsed for two decades when the State tried to erase regional differences by putting in place shared administrative structures east of the Quebec, the start of the 1980s sees this policy change, as the great region Bas-Saint-Laurent-Gasp\u00e9sie is split into two different territories, being more accurate for the distinctive cultural traditions of these regions.\nThe evolution of the toponymy of the region takes root in the different steps of its development, with at first the initial settlement by First Nations, followed by a progressive settlement by French-speaking colonists starting in the 18th century, but mostly in the 19th, a small Scottish presence starting in the 1800s, with activities centred on agriculture and the exploitation of its waters and forests. The last phase of this evolution took place when some inland communities started to decline and its centres of activity were reinforced.\nGeography.\nSituation and political divisions.\nThe Bas-Saint-Laurent is a region in the East of Quebec, delimited to the north by the Saint Lawrence River, to the south by New-Brunswick and Maine, to the east by the Gasp\u00e9 Peninsula and to the west by C\u00f4te-du-Sud. It extends over an area of , with of land area, which represents a bit less than 2% of the total area of Quebec, however, this area also represents 10% of the inhabited area of Quebec, or about half the land area of Switzerland.\nThe region is divided into eight Regional county municipalities (RCM), which contain 130 municipalities. Bas Saint-Laurent contained 200,462 inhabitants in 2011, of which 55,400 were in its most populous RCM, Rimouski-Neigette. Otherwise, the least populous RCM of the region is Les Basques, with only 9,000 inhabitants in 2011, a number which decreased by 1,300 since 1996, making it also the RCM with the highest annual rate of population decrease of the region, with a rate of 9.6% between 2006 and 2011.\nForested areas and waterways dominate the land use of Bas-Saint-Laurent. The region counts of mixed forests, of coniferous forests and of waterways. Humid lands only covers and the land devoted to agriculture covers , while developed areas represent only , which equals to 0.5% of the total land area of the region.\nGeology.\nEven if an isolated area of Cambrian and Precambrian rocks exist in an area of the Chic-Choc Mountains, the region belongs generally to the geologic province of the Appalachian Mountains, which covers an area of , between Alabama and Newfoundland. The marks of two episodes of mountain-building, the Acadian orogeny and the Taconic orogeny, have shaped the land.\nDuring the first orogeny, the subduction of the oceanic plate created a volcanic chain in the Iapetus Ocean, off the coast of Laurentia during the Cambrian period. The magma surfacing mixed with the sediments originating from the continental erosion and the volcanic arc of islands got gradually closer to the continent to the subduction. The two collided 450 million years ago and formed a chain of immature mountains, the Taconic Mountains, their nappe covers a part of the Saint Lawrence Lowlands.\nThis first zone, which follows the river today, is known as Humber's zone. Dating from the Ordovician, this bedrock is composed primarily of sedimentary rocks : sandstone, mudrocks and conglomerates. South of this zone, the Gasp\u00e9 belt is the remnant of a second mountain formation during Siluro-Devonian times. Around 430 million years ago, the Taconic mountains eroded and created sediments that deposited at a shallow depth. As Laurentia and the micro-continent Avalonia deformed and raised the sedimentary deposits and volcanic rocks and created a second chain of mountains, the Acadian Chain, which superposes itself on the Taconic Chain.\nSeismicity.\nThe estuary of the Saint Lawrence river in front of the Charlevoix region is one of the most active seismic regions in the east of Canada. Five earthquakes of a magnitude superior to 6 have occurred in history, in February 1663, December 1791, October 1860, October 1870 and February 1925. The distribution of these earthquakes indicates a concentration in the estuary, near La Malbaie and Rivi\u00e8re-du-Loup.\nSurveys and the establishment of a seismometer network were conducted in the 1970s and allowed to circumscribe the seismically active area in an area of on along the Saint Lawrence River, this zone includes the towns of La Malbaie, Baie-Saint-Paul and La Pocati\u00e8re. The seismic data indicates that an earthquake happens on average every 36 hours in the Charlevoix-Kamouraska zone. They are concentrated in the Precambrian bedrock under the Logan line and the Appalachian Mountains, at a variable depth between deep and the surface\nAnother seismic area located in the Gulf of Saint Lawrence, in a triangle between the towns of Matane, Baie-Comeau and Sept-\u00celes. However, this seismic area is less active than the one uphill, as only an average of sixty earthquakes occur each year and has not had a destructive earthquake in history. An earthquake of magnitude 5.1 occurred in 1944 east of Godbout and another of the same magnitude occurred on the 16 March 1999, its epicentre was located at about south of Sept-\u00celes.\nTopography.\nThe topography of Bas-Saint-Laurent has two main elements : the plateaus of the Appalachian Mountains, called Notre Dame Mountains, and the lowlands in the fine stripe of land along the Saint Lawrence river. These are separated by an intermediate area of ridges and foothills which meld with the plateaus. The Notre Dame Mountains, are a group of small mountains with summits reaching between high. the landscape is sometimes interrupted by valleys, like the T\u00e9miscouata valley or Matapedia Valley. These two parallel valleys allow access to The Maritimes, Maine and Chaleur Bay.\nThe littoral, spanning across is composed of riverside land of altitudes ranging from above sea level. This area has a depth of before reaching the mountains in the west of the region, but reaches in the vicinity of Rimouski, only to shrink again in the eastern limits of the region. This riverside land disappears entirely between the municipalities of Sainte-F\u00e9licit\u00e9 and Grosses-Roches. In the western part of the territory, this littoral plain is interrupted by inselbergs, ridges reaching that can reach 200m in height, typical of the riverside land of Bas-Saint-Laurent\nIn the Quaternary, the region was marked by glaciation. the Wisconsin glaciation caused the crust to sink by in the vicinity of Rimouski. When the end of the glaciation started in 18,000 BP, it opened a sound in the Saint-Laurent valley, isolating the glacier covering Bas-Saint-Laurent from the one covering C\u00f4te-Nord. The isostatic rebound created an inland sea, the Sea of Goldthwait, which flooded the region under at most 200m of water in the area around Rimouski.\nThe withdrawal of the Sea of Goldthwait was gradual, 2,000 years ago the isostatic rebound stabilised at around per year, the withdrawal of the water formed a number of narrow streaks of emerged land near the riverside between Rivi\u00e8re-du-Loup and Rimouski, known today as \u00cele aux Li\u00e8vres, \u00cele Verte, \u00eele aux Basques, \u00eele du Bic and \u00eele Saint-Barnab\u00e9.\nHydrography.\nThe estuary of the Saint Lawrence river, to the north of the region, plays a primary role in the region. It is divided in two regions split at Cacouna: west of Cacouna, it is called a medium estuary, while east of the municipality it is called a maritime estuary or lower estuary.\nThe region is relatively poor in fresh water, since lakes and rivers only count as 1.5% of the land area. It possesses two hydrographic regions, the first holds all the streams that pour into the estuary of the Saint-Lawrence river and the region of Chaleur Bay and Perc\u00e9, whose streams flow south into New-Brunswick and Maine. These regions influenced the layout of the administrative areas of Bas-Saint-Laurent, by setting limits to some regional county municipalities.\nThe largest drainage basins of the region are located in the south of the territory. These are the drainage basins of the Matapedia River () and Madawaska River (). Ranking third, the drainage basin of the Cascap\u00e9dia River of , half of this basin is located within the limits of the administrative region. Among the notable rivers pouring into the Saint-Lawrence, we can count the Mitis River (), Matane River (), Rimouski River (), Rivi\u00e8re du Loup () and Trois Pistoles River ().\nBas-Saint-Laurent counts 2,417 lakes, of which 90% do not exceed an area of . About 30% of them are situated in the RCM of Rimouski-Neigette. The two largest lakes of the region are Lake T\u00e9miscouata () and Lake Matapedia (), significant human settlement on their shore has taken place, as well as along the roads going through their valleys. These lakes also distinguish themselves by their north west and south west orientation, compared to most of the other lakes of the region which prefer to follow the orientation of the creases and breaks of the Appalachian Mountains.\nClimate.\nBas-Saint-Laurent, like the rest of Quebec, is a Nordic American territory. The Quebecois geographer Louis-Edmond Hamelin categorized the region in his pre-north area, second of the five zones of his map of nordicity zones.\nThe oceanic influence of the estuary of the Saint Lawrence River has a small influence on the climate of the region, making it more alike to the climate of meridional Quebec, than with \"Nordic\" towns like La Sarre in Abitibi or Roberval, Quebec in Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean, located at the same latitude than the town of Matane. However, the climate of Bas-Saint-Laurent is of continental type, with a \"great amplitude and no dry periods\".\nThe French geographer Raoul Blanchard described the temperature variations between winter and summer as \"brutal\". During the winter, which lasts for five months, the cold freezes the lakes and rivers and transforms the estuary into a \"vast prairie of ice\".\nThe oceanic influence, while it mitigates the cold of the winters, cools the summers. The average temperature in July in Rimouski inferior by 4 degrees to the one recorded in Quebec. To this, the wind of the north west adds humidity and cold.\nRainfall is abundant and consistent throughout the year. The region currently receives annually of rainfall, of which between is snow. The oceanic influence is less present inland, where slightly warmer temperatures in the summer and slightly colder in the winter are recorded.\nNatural environment.\nFlora.\nBas-Saint-Laurent is part of the natural province of the Appalachian Mountains in the ecological reference area of Quebec. The forests of Bas-Saint-Laurent are 8,000 years old. Beyond inhabited areas, they cover the majority of the territory. They are boreal with a coniferous influence. The forests most important in order of superficy are those of golden birch, paper birch and white spruce.\nThe dominant forest of the territory is composed of golden birch trees, an Ecotone marking the transition between the temperate nordique area and the boreal area. It is located mainly in the highest part of the Appalachian plateau. The main species of trees within it are the paper birch, the balsam fir, and the white spruce, as well as rarer quaking aspens and jack pines. The second forest in superficy is composed of primarily golden birch, and covers 35% of the forested area of the region. It is mainly located in the centre of Bas-Saint-Laurent between Rivi\u00e8re-du-Loup and Rimouski. The main species of trees within it are the golden birch, balsam fir, white spruce, red spruce and the cedar, as well as rarer quaking aspens, paper birches, balsam poplars and mountain maple.\nHowever, a more profound analysis of the composition of the forests of Bas-Saint-Laurent allows to shed light on which trees grow at which elevations, type of soils and latitudes. Miroslav Grandtner categorized the south west end of the region, the littoral stripe before Riv\u00e8re-du-Loup and the medium plateau in the golden birch forest, the high plateau as part of the paper birch forest, and finally, the Chic-Choc Mountains as part of the white spruce forest.\nFauna.\nThe fauna of Bas-Saint-Laurent is similar to the one found in other parts of Quebec and has a relatively poor diversity in species. The glacial episodes of the Pleistocene drove away the animals of the ice-covered area and these came back gradually as the ice sheet melted over the last 18,000 years.\nThe melting of the ice sheet and the flood of the sea of Goldthwait around the current estuary brought molluscs like true mussels, soft-shell clams and scallops. belugas and other whales visit it. According to the remains of marine mammals found in altitude further inland, narvals, walruses and earless seals were also present in the region.\nOn land, the eider appears around 18,000 BP and a mastodon closely related to the mammoth inhabited the area before disappearing 8000 years ago. Today, the region is dominated by the big game moose, white-tailed deer and black bear. The small game is composed of the ruffed grouse, the spruce grouse and snowshoe hare. The muskrat, North American beaver and red fox are also usual sights in the forests of Bas-Saint-Laurent.\nMany species of birds live along the estuary of Saint Lawrence. The Canada goose, snow goose and brant do a halt in the tidal marshes located along the litoral between La Pocati\u00e8re and Pointe-au-P\u00e8re. Diverse types of duck are present, like the American black duck, Northern pintail, two types of surface duck. Diving ducks are represented by the common goldeneye and ring-necked duck, while sea ducks are represented by the common eider and long-tailed duck.\nEnvironmental protection.\nBas-Saint-Laurent has only one wetland area according to the Ramsar Convention, the Baie de l'Isle-Verte, part of it is protected by the national wildlife reserve of baie de L'Isle-Verte. This swamp is primarily occupied by cordgrasses and is an important nesting area for the American black duck, as well as a stop for migratory birds in spring.\nThe region has four national parks. The Lac-T\u00e9miscouata National Park is located east of the Lake T\u00e9miscouata and protects a representative part of the Notre Dame Mountains and several ancient forests. The Bic National Park, near Rimouski, protects the litoral of the south of the estuary of Saint Lawrence. The Gasp\u00e9sie National Park, of which only a small part is within the limits of the region, is characterized by several summits taller than . Its diverse climate and its landscape host a flora unique in Quebec. Finally, about 30% of the Saguenay\u2013St. Lawrence Marine Park, the first marine park of Quebec, is located in the region. It holds the longest fjord in the east of Canada as well as a part of the largest estuary in the world, which makes it a location of considerable marine biodiversity. It is the only park administered in Canada by both the Government of Quebec and Government of Canada.\nThree other parks, ecological reserves, more restricted protected areas, are located in the centre of the region, the reserves of Fernald, Charles-B.-Banville and Ir\u00e8ne-Fournier. At the same level of protection, there are six floristic parks, most of them within the Gasp\u00e9sie National Park.\nThe largest protected areas of the region are those protected by the confinement areas of the white-tailed deer. Just these protected areas cover nearly 80% of the protected area of the region. Bas-Saint-Laurent contains about 27% of the protected areas of this designation. The second largest designation by superficy are the protected areas devoted to the protection of aquatic birds, of which a large part () are in a marine environment.\nAlthough they are not strictly considered protected areas, the territories structured for the gestion of wildlife cover 45,5% of the surface area of the region. They are divided in four wildlife reserves and five Zone d'exploitation contr\u00f4l\u00e9e.\nDemography.\nAfter reaching its peak in the middle of the 20th century due to the strong natality and a reduction of child mortality, the population of Bas-Saint-Laurent has declined over the last 50 years. This is not unique to the region, as the population living on the south shore of the estuary, in the regions of C\u00f4te-du-Sud, Bas-Saint-Laurent and Gasp\u00e9sie, proportionally declined from 9.3 to 5.4% of the total population of Quebec between 1951 and 1991. This decline is due to structural issues like the rationalization of agriculture and the depletion of the forests, but also to rural flight and a declining birth rate since the 1960s.\nPopulation.\nBas-Saint-Laurent was home to 200,500 inhabitants on the first of July 2011, which represents 2.5% of the total population of Quebec. This number indicates that this share has dropped by 4% since 1996. More than 40% of the population of the region lives in two RCMs, Rimouski-Neigette (55,364 inhabitants in 2011) and Rivi\u00e8re-du-Loup (34,326 inhabitants in 2011).\nSince 1951, the region has seen its population stagnate or slightly decline. This is due to two opposing factors, the decline of rural areas and the reinforcement of urban areas, like Rimouski and Rivi\u00e8re-du-Loup. The share of these two towns alone went from 16% of the total population of the region in 1951 to 34% in 2001. The new importance of these urban centres explain the fact that only their RCMs have had a population increase between 1951 and 2001. Opposite to these, RCMs devoid of a strong urban centre, like La Matap\u00e9dia, T\u00e9miscouata and Les Basques, have been the RCMs where the population has dropped the most in the region.\nAccounting for the population decrease observed since 1951, even when Quebec's population has increased by 82%, it is not surprising that the share of the population of Quebec living in Bas-Saint-Laurent has decreased from 5.2% in 1951 to 2.8% in 2001.\nAge.\nThe population of Bas-Saint-Laurent is significantly older than the population of Quebec as a whole. In 2011, the average age of the population of Bas-Saint-Laurent was 47.3 years, making it the second oldest region of Quebec by that criterion, behind neighbouring Gasp\u00e9sie\u2013\u00celes-de-la-Madeleine (49.0 years) and just before the region in third place, Mauricie (47.2).\nThe share of youths under the age of 20 is also one of the lowest of Quebec, at 19.5%, compared to the average of 21.7%.\nAs is the case for data on population, the data on the age of said population shows a clear divide between the two urban RCMs and the rural ones. The RCM Les Basques sees an important aging of its population and has the lowest share of youths between 0 and 19 years old (17.5), the population over 65 years old has the largest share (25.6%), and the average age of 51 years is the highest of the region in 2011.\nLanguage.\nNearly all residents of Bas-Saint-Laurent speak French as their mother tongue. According to the 2006, 98.6% of those who responded declared their native tongue to be French, 0.6% declared English, and 0.8% listed a different language. Only 315 people indicated both French and English to be their native tongues, and 86 people cited French and another language.\nThe proportion of Bas-Saint-Laurent residents reporting they can speak both French and English was 15.6%, compared to 40.6% in all of Quebec. This share was greater in the two largest cities of the region, reaching 21.7% in Rimouski and 18.0% in Rivi\u00e8re-du-Loup. Among smaller towns, Notre-Dame-du-Lac stood out with a bilingual rate of 20.3%. In the region, 140 people reported they only spoke English, and 125 others reported that they could not speak either French or English.\nImmigration.\nThe regional conference of elected representatives considers immigration to be a major issue for the economic and social development of Bas-Saint-Laurent and expends great efforts to attract new inhabitants, it also creates programs of insertion and promotion for them. Bas-Saint-Laurent welcomed 585 immigrants between 2001 and 2006, which is about 30% of the 2000 inhabitants who migrated there according to the 2006 census. The RCM of Rimouski-Neigette welcomed more than half (310) of the new arrivals in the region between 2001 and 2006\nThese numbers must however be put in relation to the fact that 77.3% of the 236,975 immigrants to settle in Quebec between 1998 and 2007 chose the metropolitan region of Montr\u00e9al, Bas-Saint-Laurent received only 0.2% of the immigrants that came to Quebec during this period. \nDemographic projection.\nAccording to the most recent demographic projection from the Institut de la statistique du Qu\u00e9bec, the population of Bas-Saint-Laurent will register a slight decline to 198,600 in 2031. According to this prediction, the proportion of inhabitants above 65 years old should reach 36% and will be twice as large as the share of inhabitants between 0 and 19 years old. This demographic prediction settles that the average age of the population of Bas-Saint-Laurent would reach 53 years, an increase of 6% compared to the latest data. The positive net migration rate will be insufficient in countering the negative rate of natural increase of the population.\nHistory.\nPrehistory and proto-history.\nThe first inhabitants of the area that is now known as Bas-Saint-Laurent lived on the shore of the estuary soon after the glaciers melted Archeological excavations between 1980 and 1990 around Bic and Rimouski indicate an amerindian presence during the Paleoindian, between 9,000 and 8,000 BP years, according to Pierre Dumais and Gilles Rousseau. and between 10,000 and 8,000 BP years according to Claude Chapdelaine.\nPaleoindian sites discovered on an ancient beach above and a sea shelf contained stone tools and lithic flakes, indicating an industry belonging to the Plano culture. These nomads inhabited the region and practiced a hunter-gatherer lifestyle.\nA second period, the Archaic covers about 5,000 years and starts at around 7,000 BP to end 2,500 years ago in the south of Quebec. In 1977, researchers listed 19 sites in the region; six near the estuary and thirteen inland. The Archaic Period is characterised by nomad populations using various methods to use more efficiently the resources of the land. The sites are often located near small lakes or along rivers like the Touladi River in the T\u00e9miscouata. The artifacts discovered seem to indicate these groups preferred hunting rather than fishing.\nFour sites are located in the Bic National Park. The most ancient, dated at around 4,000 years old, is located on the east shore of the Orignal's Cape. It is an old abandoned marine shelf abandoned 1,000 years ago by the Sea of Goldthwait. Aside from tools and lithic flakes, archeologists also found broken and heated stones, sign that the inhabitants created hearths with which they cooked food and maybe smoked the meat.\nBasque people.\nJust like the Normands and the Bretons, Basque fishermen started exploiting the marine ressources of the estuary and gulf of the Saint Lawrence in the 16th century. Their presence is confirmed as early as the 1520s and becomes more frequent right after the expeditions of Jacques Cartier.\nAround 1560, the Basque own a fleet of a hundred cod-fishers and thirty whalers. They first exploit the abundant ressources present in the estuary and the banks of Newfoundland, but around 1570, it seems the reduced numbers of whale colonies push them to search for them all the way to the medium estuary of the Saint Lawrence.\nThe hunt is mainly located at the level of the chasse Saguenay fjord. L'\u00eele aux Basques, located in front of Trois-Pistoles, on the south shore of the Saint Lawrence River, it becomes a privileged place for the Basque to skin the whales captured in the area and melt their fat. Three furnaces still stand to remind us of this activity.\nSlow colonization of the littoral.\nEven if under French rule, more than twenty segnories were granted along the bank of the river, all the way to M\u00e9tis, and even inland (the segnories of Madawaska, Lac-Mitis and Lac-Matap\u00e9dia), the settlement of Bas-Saint-Laurent remains sparse until 1790. With the exception of Kamouraska, which had a quicker colonization, in the prolongation of C\u00f4te-du-Sud and the royal path, Bas-Saint-Laurent remains isolated. When conquered, around 1760, the population east of Kamouraska is composed of a couple dozen families of pioneers and is concentrated in four seignories : Rivi\u00e8re-du-Loup, Isle-Verte, Trois-Pistoles and Rimouski. In 1790, Bas-Saint-Laurent, with the exception of Kamouraska, is home to barely 1250 inhabitants spread across hundreds of kilometers of shore, between Notre-Dame-du-Portage and Matane.\nThe construction of the Chemin du Portage around 1783 which allowed to link the valley of the Saint-Laurent with the British colonies of the Maritimes, which makes the area less isolated, but doesn't induce any permanent settlement alongside its path.\nBetween 1790 and 1831, the population of Bas-Saint-Laurent in the old county of Rimouski (east of Kamouraska) goes from 1,000 to 10,000 inhabitants. The population of the county of Kamouraska nearly triples by changing from 5,500 to 15,000 inhabitants. This increase in population is due to both a strong natural growth and migration from more western regions. This settlement allows a nearly continuous exploitation of the Ribbon farms on the banks of the river in some places and the establishment of the first farms inland. Around Cacouna, in 1831, the settlement has already progressed enough to reach the fourth layer of farms. It is also around this time that the isolation is broken: in 1830, one can go to Rimouski by the royal path.\nThe years which follow the conquest are full of hardship for the catholic clergy. Even if the population justify it, the bishop struggles to make the British authorities recognize the new parishes. The first parish of Bas-Saint-Laurent east of Kamouraska is Cacouna, created in 1825, a century and a half after the arrival of the first \"un si\u00e8cle et demi apr\u00e8s l'arriv\u00e9e des premiers\" pioneers. Even if a number of families of Scottish origin settle in the area in the 1820s in the region of, following John MacNider, however the French-speaking population will remain the strong majority of the region.\nEnd of isolation.\nThe region's population increased from 400 inhabitants in 1829 to 11,169 in 1881. Three factors explain this rise. First, the development of agriculture in the lowlands is booming. Second, entrepreneurs like William Price establish sawmills which creates opportunities of employment for factory and forest workers, favorable trade with the United Kingdom and the United States allows this industry to profit with their exports finally, Rimouski turns into a regional centre of services with the establishment of a courthouse in 1862, the creation of the diocese of Rimouski in 1867 and the opening of a seminar in 1871.\nThe development of transportation, in particular the service assured by the Intercolonial Railway since 1873, creates a boom in trade and pushes agriculture to specialize in dairy production. Taking advantage of the large supply of lumber inland, the enterprise Price Brothers and Company builds a large sawmill at the mouth of the Rimouski River in 1899. The Great Depression of the 1930s reduces lumber demand and forces part of the population to migrate further inland; the colonization period between 1880 and 1930 sees a number of failures leading to the closure of a number of plusieurs \u00e9checs menant \u00e0 la fermeture de parishes due to the exodus of their inhabitants. with the creation of the colonies of Esprit-Saint, de La Trinit\u00e9-des-Monts et de Saint-Eug\u00e8ne-de-Ladri\u00e8re, the inhabited area reaches its maximum.\nIn May 1950, a fire in the sawmill of the Price Brothers spreads over large parts of Rimouski and forces the region to re-allocate its resources towards services. The development of the mining, forestry and hydroelectric industries in C\u00f4te-Nord allows entrepreneurs like Jules-A. Brillant to develop a bustling business in the sectors of communication, transportation, wholesale and construction. With renewed involvement of the state after the Quiet Revolution, Rimouski affirms itself as the capital of the region and its service center. This change in the regional economy will negatively impact the hinterland, whose population reinforces Rimouski and the neighboring towns, like Saint-Anaclet-de-Lessard and the old municipalities of Le Bic, Rimouski-Est and Pointe-au-P\u00e8re.\nContemporary period.\nIn reaction to this rural flight, the federal and provincial governments establish in the 1960s, a test program of spatial planning in the regions of Gasp\u00e9sie and Bas-Saint-Laurent. The Bureau d'am\u00e9nagement de l'Est du Qu\u00e9bec (BAEQ) is created in 1963 and the planners work for three years on a plan to raise the quality of life of the population by notably improving the mobility and formation of the workforce. The second part of the plan is the closure of villages in the hinterland of Bas-Saint-Laurent and the relocation of thousands inhabitants.\nA movement of protest, the Op\u00e9rations Dignit\u00e9, are organized between 1970 and 1972 in the communities affected by the plan by the priests of their respective parishes. The first of these operations takes place in the hinterland of Matane and in the Matap\u00e9dia Valley, followed by a second in the hinterland of Rimouski and in T\u00e9miscouata and a third in the east end of Gasp\u00e9sie. In response to these protests the governments reconsiders the plan and cancels the closure of these villages.\nIn the early 1980s, the government of Quebec decentralizes its spatial planning and grants to the regions a part of the responsibility in the management policies of their territory. The old county councils created after the abolition of the seigniorial system, in 1855, are turned into regional county municipalities (RCM) in 1982 and are granted the responsabilit\u00e9 of the spatial planning of the territory.\nNoting the failure of a forced merger of the two regions in the 1960s, the administrative region of Bas-Saint-Laurent-Gasp\u00e9sie-\u00celes-de-la-Madeleine is divided by the government in December 1987. The new administrative region of Bas-Saint-Laurent keeps roughly the eastern border that was created in 1788 during the first carving of the territory for administrative purposes. In this new region, the RCM of Kamouraska becomes the eighth RCM of the region.\nIn 2012, the region contains 130 municipalities of which 114 belong to the administrative class of local municipalities grouped in eight RCM. the number of municipalities has been in a constant drop for 25 years. It went from 145 in 1986 to 135 in 1996. Six of these RCM have direct access to the estuary of the Saint Lawrence de ces MRC, the two others (La Matap\u00e9dia and T\u00e9miscouata) are entirely landlocked.\nFourteen unorganized areas, most of which are uninhabited, do not belong to any municipality. These areas, which contain 37% of the land area of the region, are administered by the RCM which are responsible of the local services.\nThere also exist two Indian reserves under the jurisdiction of the Maliseet First Nation of Viger. The bureau of the community stands on an area of 0.17 hectare, located alongside the river Cacouna, while an area of , located along the route 185 in a forested area of the canton of Kataskomiq, holds the function of a meeting point for the community. The two territories do not possess any permanent inhabitants.\nPolitics and administration.\nAdministrative divisions.\nInside the RCMs are important cities including:\nCities.\nRimouski.\nAs a service centre, the city of Rimouski is the main urban centre of Bas-Saint-Laurent, located on the south bank of the St. Lawrence, east of Quebec City. Located away from the capital of Quebec, the city is the economic, social and cultural metropolis of the region. A number of major regional institutions, like Universit\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec \u00e0 Rimouski, the c\u00e9gep de Rimouski, the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Rimouski, the courthouse, the federal and provincial public administration, the seat of a number of companies and the regional hospital of Rimouski, the most important hospital centre of eastern Quebec, are located there.\nWith a population of 47,687 inhabitants in 2012, this new city created in 2002, as part of the municipal reorganizations which occurred across Quebec. In this reorganization the city of Rimouski was fused with the municipalities of Rimouski-Est, Pointe-au-P\u00e8re, Sainte-Odile-sur-Rimouski, Sainte-Blandine and Mont-Lebel. Another process of municipal fusion added the municipality Le Bic to the city on the 16 of September 2009. The area of the new city covers and extends itself along the route 132 and the river on .\nRivi\u00e8re-du-Loup.\nRivi\u00e8re-du-Loup is the second most important city of Bas-Saint-Laurent. The main concurrent of Rimouski, the city houses 19,695 inhabitants in 2012. It is the result of the merging of Rivi\u00e8re-du-Loup with the municipality of the parish of Saint-Patrice-de-la-Rivi\u00e8re-du-Loup.\nMatane.\nThe city of Matane is the third-largest city of the region by population. Granted as a fief and seigniory to Mathieu D'Amours in 1667 when it was a trading post of the fur trade and a fishing port, it is also the easternmost city of Bas-Saint-Laurent. Matane is sometimes considered as part of Gasp\u00e9sie, like in the tourism sector where it is part of the touristic region of Gasp\u00e9sie. Two small neighboring municipalities, Petit-Matane and Saint-Luc-de-Matane were appended to the city in 2001. Matane was home to 14,504 inhabitants in 2012.\nOther cities.\nMont-Joli (6,673 inhabitants in 2012) is a turning plate of transportation in eastern Quebec. It is the eastern end of the autoroute 20 since 2008, The city contains a train station and Mont-Joli Airport operating regular flights to Montreal, Quebec, C\u00f4te-Nord and the Magdalen Islands. A foundry and transformation factories of goods taken from the forest are the main employers of the city.\nLocated at the confluence of the Matap\u00e9dia and Humqui rivers, Amqui (6,292 inhabitants in 2012) is the most important town of the Matapedia Valley and the administrative centre of RCM of La Matap\u00e9dia. Founded in 1907, the exploitation of the surrounding forest long constituted the main activity of the city. Today, the forestry industry of Matapedia seeks to optimize their use of the wood with projects to develop the use of the residual biomass for energetic ends and the production of goods of second and third transformation in collaboration with the Service de recherche et d\u2019expertise en transformation des produits forestiers (SEREX), an entity attached to the c\u00e9gep de Rimouski.\nT\u00e9miscouata-sur-le-Lac (5,085 inhabitants in 2012), is the result of the fusion of the towns of Cabano and Notre-Dame-du-Lac in 2010. This administrative centre of the RCM of T\u00e9miscouata, like the rest of its RCM, owes its wealth principally to agriculture, the maple syrup industry and forestry. Since 1976, the factory Norampac owned by the company Cascades which manufactures corrugated fiberboard and a manufacturer of prefabricated homes are established in the municipality.\nLa Pocati\u00e8re (4,242 inhabitants in 2012) is the largest city of the RCM of Kamouraska. Seat of the Diocese of Sainte-Anne-de-la-Pocati\u00e8re, of the c\u00e9gep de La Pocati\u00e8re and one of the two campuses of the Institut de technologie agroalimentaire, the city has had a strong agricultural sector since the end of the 17th century. Its economy benefits from the presence of a factory assembling rolling stocks owned by the company Bombardier Transportation.\nTrois-Pistoles (3,471 inhabitants in 2012) is the administrative centre of the RCM Les Basques, the least populated of the eight RCMs of Bas-Saint-Laurent. Its economy is dominated by agriculture and tourism.\nSchool districts.\nFrancophone:\nAnglophone:\nRepresentation and political tendencies.\nSince the modification of the electoral map of Quebec in 2011, three constituencies are entirely located inside the region of Bas-Saint-Laurent: Matane-Matap\u00e9dia, Rimouski et Rivi\u00e8re-du-Loup\u2013T\u00e9miscouata. The voters of the western part of the region are part of the constituency of C\u00f4te-du-Sud, shared between the regions of Bas-Saint-Laurent and Chaudi\u00e8re-Appalaches.\nThe Maliseet are also represented by the Maliseet First Nation of Viger.\nProvincial representation.\nThe region is represented in the National Assembly of Quebec since the 2014 Quebec general election by :\nWith the exception of Rimouski's, all constituencies voted \"no\" during the 1980 Quebec referendum. In 1992, the five constituencies of Bas-Saint-Laurent refused the Charlottetown Accord. Three years later, every constituency votes \"yes\" to the 1995 Quebec referendum.\nFederal representation.\nBas-Saint-Laurent is represented in the House of Commons of Canada since the 2025 Canadian federal election by :\nEconomy.\nThe economy of Bas-Saint-Laurent was long dominated by two traditional industries: agriculture and forestry, with, in keeping with the location, additional fishing and tourism industries, including indigenous fishing. The fishing industry traditionally exploited mostly species like the cod, the herring, and the eel; this was supplemented by the harvest of crustaceans and seaweed. This last good was either exported to the United States or used locally to produce mattresses and cushions. While agriculture was first only present in the narrow valley near the banks of the river, forestry was already a critical industry in the mid-1800s, and expands in the plateaus of the hinterland later on.\nSince the start of the 20th century, the region is turning towards the second and third transformations of its resources and is attempting to create new markets, notably in marine technology and biotechnology, environmentally friendly construction and peat usage. Like in the rest of Quebec, the economy of the region is dominated by small and medium companies, as 96% employ less than 50 people.\nGross domestic product and disposable income.\nOften considered as a resource well by the government of Quebec, Bas-Saint-Laurent possesses a strong divide between its four industrial centers, Rimouski, Rivi\u00e8re-du-Loup, La Pocati\u00e8re and Matane, as these benefited from the growth of the knowledge and high tech industry to assure their development and the smaller communities outside of these industrial centers often depending on a single industry from sectors in difficulty.\nThe Institut de la statistique du Qu\u00e9bec reports that the gross domestic product of the region was of 5 billions in 2009, registering a growth of 1.3% compared to the previous year. The growth of the service economy is the main factor in this growth, and it now represents 70% of the regional economy, a figure close to the 71.6% of Quebec as a whole. In the good production sector, traditional industries register a sharp decline, as forestry declines by 25%, while the industries transforming wood and the paper industry declined by more than 12%.\nThe GDP per capita of the region was at $30,376 in 2010, which puts Bas-Saint-Laurent at the 13th place among the 17 Administrative regions of Quebec. The disposable and discretionary income was at $29,069. Excluding the amount taken by direct taxation and non-wage labour costs, the income per capita is at $23,044, the smallest income in Quebec after the neighbouring region of Gasp\u00e9sie\u2013\u00celes-de-la-Madeleine.\nEach inhabitant of Bas-Saint-Laurent receives an average of $7,021 from the state, an amount superior the average of $5878 in Quebec. The unemployment rate being above Quebec's average and the larger share of the population eligible to receive benefits from the government program of Old Age Security and Retraite Quebec explain this more generous welfare.\nStatistics on the regional level do hide significant differences between the two most urbanized RCMs, Rimouski-Neigette and Rivi\u00e8re-du-Loup and the six others, who are more rural. The average disposable income in the RCM of Rimouski being $25,165, this is 20% more than in the RCMs of T\u00e9miscouata ($20,306) and La Matap\u00e9dia ($20,603).\nEmployment.\nEven Bas-Saint-Laurent is located at the 13th place among the 17 regions of Quebec in GDP per capita, it sports an unemployment rate of 8.0% in 2011, a figure in decline of 2% compared to the previous year. The share of the workforce in the population is at 58.7% and the employment rate is at 54.1%, a figure which has risen by 0.5% since 2010. This growth can be explained by the reduced share of the population in working age which dropped by 1,400, but as well by a slight growth of 800 new available jobs. The 90,200 employed men and women of the region have only a slight divide in employment rate and nearly a quarter of them (21,800) work in industries producing goods.\nA study performed in 2009 by the Secor firm notes that the decline of the population under 20 years old combined with the timid growth of the workforce and the drop of the unemployment rate will create a workforce shortage in the coming years. The signs of this new reality in the workforce are already apparent, as Secor notes, taking as an example the thirty programs of professional and technic formations that struggle to recruit enough students.\nPrimary sector.\nAgriculture and food industry.\nThe land area devoted to agriculture in the region covered in 2005, which is around 15.6% of its land area and contributed to more than 6% of its gross domestic product. This industry is mainly located in the plain following the banks of the river and in the foothills of the valleys of T\u00e9miscouata and Matap\u00e9dia.\nIn 2007, the dairy production had the largest share among all regional agricultural productions with 50% of the revenue, according to the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food. In this industry, a reinforcement of the activities can be observed with a reduction of the number of independent companies but with a global growth of 12% of the milk quotas between 1997 and 2007. The region takes first place in sheep farming, with 32% of all lambs produced in Quebec in 2007. Bas-Saint-Laurent also practices beef cattle farming and pig farming.\nThe maple syrup industry is in growth, as the cuts increased from 3.7 to 6.3 million between 1997 and 2007. The industry producing small fruits like the strawberry, the raspberry, the blueberry is stagnant, and the land area devoted to the growth of cereal grew by 10%, while the one devoted to the market garden industry shrunk.\nForestry industry.\nThe forestry industry of Bas-Saint-Laurent took a hard hit during the American housing market crisis and the ensuing decrease in new projects, as these hit a roof of 500 000 in 2009. Even as new housing projects start to reappear and factories start producing more once again, the industry still continues to turn itself to non traditional markets and tries to sell smaller-diameter softwood logs.\nPeat industry.\nThe peat industry of Bas-Saint-Laurent extracts around 45% of the peat production of Quebec and builds specialized transformation tools de tourbe. There are around twenty companies in this industry that employ 1 500 and export 80% of their. Lately, this industry has made a great effort in converging with the agroenvironnemental industry, in fields like biofiltration, composting, agriculture and horticulture\nAround 2002, a number of initiatives were taken by the producers of the industry and the government of Quebec to develop the industry. The producers managed to perform a life-cycle assessment of the peat and experiment new processes to rehabilitate commercially exploited bogs.\nSecondary sector.\nWith the recession caused by the subprime mortgage crisis in the United States, the wood manufacturing industry, most important manufacturing industry of the region, suffered greatly due to its inability to export in this market, but should recover along with the American economy. Some niches, like biomass valorization, might heal this industry, as well as it turning to new markets.\nOther industries benefit from a favorable economic climate. This is notably the case for Enercon and other companies of the wind industry in Matane and the factory of Bombardier Transportation at La Pocati\u00e8re, which will fulfill an assembly contract of rolling stocks for the cities of Montreal and New York.\nTertiary sector.\nThe tertiary sector of Bas-Saint-Laurent today comprises the majority of the employed population everywhere in the region, but the four main cities of the region, Rimouski, Rivi\u00e8re-du-Loup, La Pocati\u00e8re and Matane, hold the majority of the employment in the sector, and all the regional institutions and infrastructure are mostly located there.\nTourism industry.\nThe administrative region of Bas-Saint-Laurent is divided into two areas of tourism administration and promotion. The six western RCM form the touristic region of Bas-Saint-Laurent, while the RCMs of Matane and La Matap\u00e9dia are part of the touristic region of the Gasp\u00e9 Peninsula.\nTourism is an important source of seasonal employment in the region, which possesses a few important tourist attraction sites.\nTransportation.\nMost of Bas-Saint-Laurent's car traffic transits through three highways: the Autoroute 20, which goes throughout the region west of Mont-Joli, with the exception of a section between L'Isle-Verte and Le Bic, Autoroute 85 and Route 185 passing through T\u00e9miscouata by the north-west of New Brunswick as well as the Route 132, which surrounds Gasp\u00e9 Peninsula east of Sainte-Flavie. A fourth important road links Matane and Amqui by following the Matane River.\nTwo road projects are being carried out.\nThe road-work has been ongoing since 2002 with the goal of turning Route 185 into a motorway. The first phase of the project was part of a program aiming to improve road safety and was completed in 2011. The second phase should lengthen the motorway by and should be concluded between the fall of 2013 and 2015. The last phase of the road-work linking Saint-Antonin to Saint-Louis-du-Ha! Ha! with a length of being worked on was authorized by the government in 2011. The third phase is expected by the Minist\u00e8re des Transports, de la Mobilit\u00e9 durable et de l'\u00c9lectrification des Transports du Qu\u00e9bec to be completed by 2025.\nMajor communities.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

They are primarily spread through arthropod vectors (mainly ticks and mosquitoes). The family gets its name from the yellow fever virus; \"flavus\" is Latin for \"yellow\", and yellow fever in turn was named because of its propensity to cause jaundice in victims. There are 89 species in the family divided among four genera. Diseases associated with the group include: hepatitis (hepaciviruses), hemorrhagic syndromes, fatal mucosal disease (pestiviruses), hemorrhagic fever, encephalitis, and the birth defect microcephaly (flaviviruses).\nStructure.\nVirus particles are enveloped and spherical with icosahedral-like geometries that have pseudo T=3 symmetry. They are about 40\u201360 nm in diameter.\nGenome.\nMembers of the family \"Flaviviridae\" have monopartite, linear, single-stranded RNA genomes of positive polarity, and 9.6 to 12.3 kilobase in total length. The 5'-termini of flaviviruses carry a methylated nucleotide cap, while other members of this family are uncapped and encode an internal ribosome entry site.\nThe genome encodes a single polyprotein with multiple transmembrane domains that is cleaved, by both host and viral proteases, into structural and non-structural proteins. Among the non-structural protein products (NS), the locations and sequences of NS3 and NS5, which contain motifs essential for polyprotein processing and RNA replication respectively, are relatively well conserved across the family and may be useful for phylogenetic analysis.\nLife cycle.\nViral replication is cytoplasmic. Entry into the host cell is achieved by attachment of the viral envelope protein E to host receptors, which mediates clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Replication follows the positive-stranded RNA virus replication model. Positive-stranded RNA virus transcription is the method of transcription. Translation takes place by viral initiation. The virion assembles by budding through intracellular membranes and exits the host cell by exocytosis.\nHost range and evolutionary history.\nA wide variety of natural hosts are used by different members of the \"Flaviviridae\", including fish, mammals including humans and various invertebrates, such as those specific to mollusks and crustaceans. The genomes of these flaviviruses show close synteny with that of the flavivirus type species, yellow fever virus. One flavivirus, the Wenzhou shark flavivirus, infects both Pacific spadenose sharks (\"Scoliodon macrorhynchos\") and Gazami crabs (\"Portunus trituberculatus\") with overlapping ranges, raising the possibility of a two-host marine lifecycle. However, another clade of flavivirus, the insect-specific flaviviruses, have genomes that do not demonstrate strong synteny with any of these groups, suggesting a complex evolutionary history.\nFlavivirus endogenous viral elements, traces of flavivirus genomes integrated into the host's DNA, are found in many species, including a tadpole shrimp \"Lepidurus articus\", the water flea \"Daphnia magna\" and a freshwater jellyfish \"Craspedacusta sowerbii\", suggesting ancient coevolution between animal and flavivirus lineages. Many of the well-known members of the family causing disease in vertebrates are transmitted via arthropod vectors (ticks and mosquitoes).\nTaxonomy.\nThe \"Flaviviridae\" are part of RNA virus supergroup II, which includes certain plant viruses and bacterial viruses. In 2022, the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) discussed in 2022 the common names such as flavivirus, flaviviral, and flaviviruses used for both the family and the genus \"Flavivirus.\" As more viruses particularly classified under separate genera became established, the names became confusing. The ICTV therefore resolved in 2023 that the genus \"Flavivirus\" should be replaced with \"Orthoflavivirus\" and that the common names can be used for the entire family.\nThe family has four genera:\nClinical importance.\nMajor diseases caused by members of the family \"Flaviviridae\" include:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

An international jury, invited by the five regular Right Livelihood Award board members, decides the awards in such fields as environmental protection, human rights, sustainable development, health, education, and peace. The prize money is shared among the winners, usually numbering four, and is \u20ac200,000. Very often one of the four laureates receives an honorary award, which means that the other three share the prize money.\nAlthough it has been promoted as an \"Alternative Nobel Prize\", it does not have any organizational ties at all to the awarding institutions of the Nobel Prize or the Nobel Foundation.\nThe Right Livelihood Award committee arranged for awards to be made in the Riksdag of Sweden the day before the Nobel prizes and the economics prize are awarded in Stockholm. The Right Livelihood Awards are generally understood as a critique of the traditional Nobel prizes. \nThe establishment of this award followed a failed attempt to have the Nobel Foundation create new prizes in the areas of environmental protection, sustainable development and human rights. The prize has been awarded to a diverse group of people and organisations, including Wangari Maathai, Astrid Lindgren, Bianca Jagger, Mordechai Vanunu, Leopold Kohr, Arna Mer-Khamis, Felicia Langer, Petra Kelly, Survival International, Amy Goodman, Catherine Hamlin, Memorial, Edward Snowden, Daniel Ellsberg, and Greta Thunberg.\nCeremony.\nSince 1985, the ceremony has taken place in Stockholm's old Parliament building, in the days before the traditional Nobel prizes are awarded in the same city. A group of Swedish Parliamentarians from different parties host the ceremony; in 2009 European Commissioner Margot Wallstr\u00f6m co-hosted the ceremony. However, in 2014 when it became public that one of the recipients of the 2014 prize was whistleblower Edward Snowden, the ceremonial group was disinvited from the Ministry for Foreign Affairs building in Stockholm.\nIn 2019, marking the 40th anniversary of the foundation of the Award, the ceremony was held at Cirkus in front of a live audience of more than 1,200 people. World-renowned artists such as Jos\u00e9 Gonz\u00e1lez and Ane Brun were among the night's performers.\nNature of the award.\nSome media refer to the prize as the \"Alternative Nobel Prize\", and the prize is frequently understood as a critique of the traditional Nobel prizes. The prize differs significantly from the Nobel Prizes:\nHistory.\nJakob von\u00a0Uexk\u00fcll, a philanthropist, sold his stamp collection worth US$1 million, which provided the initial funding for the award. Before establishing the award in 1980, von\u00a0Uexkull had tried to persuade the Nobel Foundation to establish new prizes to be awarded together with the Nobel Prizes. He suggested new prize categories to be created: one in ecology and one in development. Like the Nobel Economics Prize, this would have been possible with an amendment to the Nobel Foundation statutes and funding of the prize amount completely separate from Nobel's fortune. The Nobel Prize amount was 880,000 Swedish kronor at that time, which corresponded to US$195,000. However, as a result of the debate that followed the establishment of the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel (first awarded in 1969), the Nobel Foundation had decided not to associate the Nobel Prize with any additional awards, so von\u00a0Uexk\u00fcll's proposal was rejected.\nFrom 1980 to 2021, the foundation presented awards to 186 laureates from 73 countries. Its self-described purpose is to bestow prizes and thus publicize the work of recipients' local solutions to worldwide problems.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It includes both non-volcanic mountains, such as many of those in the North Cascades, and the notable volcanoes known as the High Cascades. The small part of the range in British Columbia is referred to as the Canadian Cascades or, locally, as the Cascade Mountains. The highest peak in the range is Mount Rainier in Washington at .\nThe Cascades are part of the Pacific Ocean's Ring of Fire, the ring of volcanoes and associated mountains around the Pacific Ocean. All of the eruptions in the contiguous United States over the last 200 years have been from the Cascade Volcanoes. The two most recent were Lassen Peak from 1914 to 1921 and a major eruption of Mount St. Helens in 1980. Minor eruptions of Mount St. Helens have also occurred since, most recently from 2004 to 2008. The Cascade Range is a part of the American Cordillera, a nearly continuous chain of mountain ranges (cordillera) that form the western \"backbone\" of North, Central, and South America.\nThe Cascades are home to many national parks and protected areas, including North Cascades National Park, Mount Rainier National Park, Crater Lake National Park, and Lassen Volcanic National Park. The northern half of the Pacific Crest Trail follows the range.\nGeography.\nThe Cascades extend northward from Lassen Peak (also known as Mount Lassen) in northern California to the confluence of the Nicola and Thompson rivers in British Columbia. The Fraser River separates the Cascades from the Coast Mountains in Canada, as does the Willamette Valley from the upper portion of the Oregon Coast Range. The highest volcanoes of the Cascades, known as the High Cascades, dominate their surroundings, often standing twice the height of the nearby mountains. They often have a visual height (height above nearby crestlines) of one mile or more. The highest peaks, such as the Mount Rainier, dominate their surroundings for .\nThe northern part of the range, north of Mount Rainier, is known as the North Cascades in the United States but is formally named the Cascade Mountains north of the Canada\u2013United States border, reaching to the northern extremity of the Cascades at Lytton Mountain. Overall, the North Cascades and Canadian Cascades are extremely rugged; even the lesser peaks are steep and glaciated, and valleys are quite low relative to peaks and ridges, so there is great local relief. The southern part of the Canadian Cascades, particularly the Skagit Range, is geologically and topographically similar to the North Cascades, while the northern and northeastern parts are less glaciated and more plateau-like, resembling nearby areas of the Thompson Plateau.\nThe range is near the Pacific Ocean and in the region's prevailing westerly winds, so it receives significant rain and snowfall, especially on the western slopes due to orographic lift, with annual snow accumulations of up to (= ) in some areas. Mount Baker in Washington recorded a national record single-season snowfall in the winter of 1998\u201399 with (= ). Before that year, Mount Rainier held the American record for snow accumulation at Paradise in 1978. It is not uncommon for some places in the Cascades to have over of annual snow accumulation, such as at Lake Helen, near Lassen Peak. Most of the High Cascades are therefore white with snow and ice year-round. The western slopes are densely covered with Douglas-fir (\"Pseudotsuga menziesii\"), western hemlock (\"Tsuga heterophylla\") and red alder (\"Alnus rubra\"), while the drier eastern slopes feature mostly ponderosa pine (\"Pinus ponderosa\"), with some western larch (\"Larix occidentalis\"), mountain hemlock (\"Tsuga mertensiana\") and subalpine fir (\"Abies lasiocarpa\") and subalpine larch (\"Larix lyallii\") at higher elevations. Annual rainfall is as low as on the eastern foothills due to a rain shadow effect.\nBeyond the eastern foothills is an arid plateau that was largely formed 17 to 14\u00a0million years ago by the many flows of the Columbia River Basalt Group. Together, these sequences of fluid volcanic rock form the Columbia Plateau in eastern Washington, Oregon, and parts of western Idaho.\nThe Columbia River Gorge is the only major break of the range in the United States. When the Cascades began to rise 7\u00a0million years ago in the late Miocene, the Columbia River drained the relatively low Columbia Plateau. As the range grew, erosion from the Columbia River was able to keep pace, carving out the gorge and major pass seen today. The gorge also exposes uplifted and warped layers of basalt from the plateau.\nHistory.\nBefore European exploration, First Nations tribes named many peaks, including \"Seekseekqua\" for Mount Jefferson (Oregon), \"M'laiksini Yaina\" for Mount McLoughlin, \"Tahoma\", the Lushootseed name for Mount Rainier, and \"Louwala-Clough\", meaning \"smoking mountain\" for Mount St. Helens.\nIn early 1792, British navigator George Vancouver explored Puget Sound and gave English names to the high mountains he saw. Mount Baker was named for Vancouver's third lieutenant, Joseph Baker, although the first European to see it was Manuel Quimper, who named it \"la gran monta\u00f1a del Carmelo\" (\"Great Mount Carmel\") in 1790. Mount Rainier was named after Admiral Peter Rainier. Later in 1792, Vancouver had his lieutenant William Robert Broughton explore the lower Columbia River. He named Mount Hood after Lord Samuel Hood, an admiral of the Royal Navy. Mount St. Helens was sighted by Vancouver in May 1792, from near the mouth of the Columbia River. It was named for Alleyne FitzHerbert, 1st Baron St Helens, a British diplomat. Vancouver's expedition did not, however, name the mountain range which contained these peaks. He referred to it simply as the \"eastern snowy range\". Earlier Spanish explorers called it \"Sierra Nevada\", meaning \"snowy mountains\".\nIn 1805, the Lewis and Clark Expedition passed through the Cascades on the Columbia River, which for many years was the only practical way to pass that part of the range. They were the first non-indigenous people to see Mount Adams, but they thought it was Mount St. Helens. When they later saw Mount St. Helens they thought it was Mount Rainier. On their return trip, Lewis and Clark spotted a high but distant snowy pinnacle that they named for the sponsor of the expedition, U.S. President Thomas Jefferson. Lewis and Clark called the Cascade Range the \"Western Mountains\".\nThe Lewis and Clark expedition, and the many settlers and traders that followed, met their last obstacle to their journey at the Cascades Rapids in the Columbia River Gorge, a feature on the river now submerged beneath the Bonneville Reservoir. Before long, the great white-capped mountains that loomed above the rapids were called the \"mountains by the cascades\" and later simply as the \"Cascades\". The earliest attested use of the name \"Cascade Range\" is in the writings of botanist David Douglas in 1825.\nIn 1814, Alexander Ross, a fur trader with the North West Company, seeking a viable route across the mountains, explored and crossed the northern Cascades between Fort Okanogan and Puget Sound. His report of the journey is vague about the route taken. He followed the lower Methow River into the mountains. He might have used Cascade Pass to reach the Skagit River. Ross was the first European-American to explore the Methow River area and likely the first to explore the Stehekin River and Bridge Creek region. Due to the difficulty of crossing the northern Cascades and the paucity of beaver, fur-trading companies made only a few explorations into the mountains north of the Columbia River after Ross.\nExploration and settlement of the Cascades region by Europeans and Americans was accelerated by the establishment of a major trading post of the Hudson's Bay Company (HBC) at Fort Vancouver near today's Portland, Oregon. From this base HBC trapping parties traveled throughout the Cascades in search of beaver and other fur-bearing animals. For example, using what became known as the Siskiyou Trail, Hudson's Bay Company trappers were the first non-natives to explore the southern Cascades in the 1820s and 1830s, establishing trails which passed near Crater Lake, Mount McLoughlin, Medicine Lake Volcano, Mount Shasta, and Lassen Peak.\nThe course of political history in the Pacific Northwest saw the spine of the Cascade Range being proposed as a boundary settlement during the Oregon Dispute of 1846. The United States rejected the proposal and insisted on the 49th parallel north, which cuts across the range just north of Mount Baker. Throughout the period of dispute and up to the creation of the Crown Colony of British Columbia in 1858, the Hudson's Bay Company's York Factory Express route, as well the route of fur brigades, followed the Okanogan River along the east edge of the Cascades and the Columbia River through the range. Passes across the range were not well known and little used. Naches Pass was used for driving cattle and horses to Fort Nisqually. Yakima Pass was also used by the Hudson's Bay Company.\nAmerican settlement of the flanks of the Coast Range did not occur until the early 1840s, at first only marginally. Following the Oregon Treaty the inward flux of migration from the Oregon Trail intensified and the passes and back-valleys of what is now the state of Washington were explored and populated, and it was not long after that railways followed. Despite its being traversed by several major freeways and rail lines, and its lower flanks subjected to major logging in recent decades, large parts of the range remain intense and forbidding alpine wilderness. Much of the northern half of the Cascades, from Rainier north, have been preserved by U.S. national or British Columbia provincial parks (such as E.C. Manning Provincial Park), or other forms of protected area.\nThe Canadian side of the range has a history that includes the Fraser Canyon Gold Rush of 1858\u201360 and its famous Cariboo Road, as well as the older Hudson's Bay Company Brigade Trail from the Canyon to the Interior, the Dewdney Trail, and older routes which connected east to the Similkameen and Okanagan valleys.\nThe southern mainline of the Canadian Pacific Railway penetrated the range via the passes of the Coquihalla River, along one of the steepest and snowiest routes in the entire Pacific Cordillera. Near Hope, B.C., the railway roadbed and the Othello Tunnels, now decommissioned, are popular tourist recreation destinations for hiking and bicycling. The pass is used by the Coquihalla Highway, a government megaproject built as part of the Expo 86 spending boom of the 1980s, which is now the main route from the Coast to the British Columbia interior. Traffic formerly went via the Fraser Canyon, to the west, or via Allison Pass and Manning Park along Highway 3 to the south, near the border.\nThe Barlow Road was the first established land path for U.S. settlers through the Cascade Range in 1845, and formed the final overland link for the Oregon Trail (previously, settlers had to raft down the treacherous rapids of the Columbia River). The Road left the Columbia at what is now Hood River and passed along the south side of Mount Hood at what is now Government Camp, terminating in Oregon City. There is an interpretive site there now at \"The End of The Oregon Trail\". The road was constructed as a toll road\u00a0\u2013 $5 per wagon\u00a0\u2013 and was very successful.\nIn addition, the Applegate Trail was created to allow settlers to avoid rafting down the Columbia River. The Trail used the path of the California Trail to north-central Nevada. From there, the Trail headed northwest into northern California, and continued northwest towards today's Ashland, Oregon. From there, settlers would head north along the established Siskiyou Trail into the Willamette Valley.\nWith the exception of the 1915 eruption of remote Lassen Peak in Northern California, the range was quiet for more than a century. Then, on May\u00a018, 1980, the dramatic eruption of Mount St. Helens shattered the quiet and brought the world's attention to the range. Geologists were also concerned that the St. Helens eruption was a sign that long-dormant Cascade volcanoes might become active once more, as in the period from 1800 to 1857 when a total of eight erupted. None have erupted since St. Helens, but precautions are being taken nevertheless, such as the Cascades Volcano Observatory and Mount Rainier Volcano Lahar Warning System in Pierce County, Washington.\nGeology.\nThe Cascade Range is made up of a band of thousands of very small, short-lived volcanoes that have built a platform of lava and volcanic debris. Rising above this volcanic platform are a few strikingly large volcanoes, like Mount Hood and Mount St. Helens, that dominate the landscape.\nThe Cascade volcanoes define the Pacific Northwest section of the Ring of Fire, an array of volcanoes that rim the Pacific Ocean. The Ring of Fire is also known for its frequent earthquakes. The volcanoes and earthquakes arise from a common source, namely subduction. In this case, the dense Juan de Fuca Plate plunges beneath the North American Plate at the Cascadia subduction zone. As the oceanic slab sinks deep into the Earth's interior beneath the continental plate, high temperatures and pressures allow water molecules locked in the minerals of solid rock to escape. The water rises into the pliable mantle above the subducting plate, causing some of the mantle to melt. This newly formed magma rises toward the Earth's surface to erupt, forming a chain of volcanoes (the Cascade Volcanic Arc) above the subduction zone.\nHuman uses.\nSoil conditions for farming are generally good, especially downwind of volcanoes. This is largely because volcanic rocks are often rich in potassium-bearing minerals such as orthoclase, and erode relatively easily. Volcanic debris, especially lahars, also helps to spread mineral-rich volcanic material, and the storage of water in the form of snow and ice is also important for agriculture. The snow-capped mountains, such as Mt. Hood and Mt. Bachelor, are used as ski resorts in the late winter, while in the summer they become popular hiking and mountaineering locations. Much of their meltwater eventually flows into reservoirs, where it is used for recreation, while its potential energy is captured to generate hydroelectric power before the water is used to irrigate crops.\nBecause of the abundance of powerful streams, many of the major westward-draining rivers of the Cascades have been dammed to provide hydroelectric power. One of these, Ross Dam on the Skagit River, retains a reservoir which spans the border southeast of Hope, British Columbia, extending into Canada. At the foot of the southeast flank of Mount Baker, at Concrete, Washington, the Baker River is dammed to form Lake Shannon and Baker Lake.\nThe Cascades harbor a largely-untapped potential for geothermal power. The U.S. Geological Survey Geothermal Research Program has been investigating this potential. Some of this energy is already being used in places like Klamath Falls, Oregon, where volcanic steam is used to heat public buildings. The highest recorded underground temperature found in the range is at below Newberry Volcano's caldera floor.\nEcology.\nForests of large, coniferous trees (western red cedars, Douglas-firs, western hemlocks, firs, pines, spruces, and others) dominate most of the Cascade Range. Cool, wet winters and warm, dry summers (largely a result of oceanic influence) favor evergreen species, whereas mild temperatures and rich soils promote fast and prolonged growth.\nAs a traveler passes through the Cascade Range, the climate first gets colder, then warmer and drier east of the crest. Most of the Cascades' lower and middle elevations are covered in coniferous forest; the higher altitudes have extensive meadows as well as alpine tundra and glaciers. The southern part of the Cascades are within the California Floristic Province, an area of high biodiversity.\nSilver fir predominates above 2500\u00a0ft, while there are moors, meadows, and mountain hemlock/subalpine fir groves from 4500 to 6000\u00a0ft on the west side. The treeline is at ~6000 feet. On the east side, subalpine forests of larch trees grade to pine and interior fir forests below 4200\u00a0ft, which grade to ponderosa below 2500\u00a0ft, which in turn grades to semidesert scrub near sea level. Above 7500\u00a0ft, the landscape is barren with either no plants or only moss and lichen.\nBlack bears, coyotes, bobcats, cougars, beavers, deer, elk, moose, mountain goats and a few wolf packs returning from Canada live in the Cascades. Fewer than 50 grizzly bears reside in the Cascades of Canada and Washington.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is one of the two official languages of Paraguay (along with Spanish), where it is spoken by the majority of the population, and where half of the rural population are monolingual speakers of the language.\nVariants of the language are spoken by communities in neighboring countries including parts of northeastern Argentina, southeastern Bolivia and southwestern Brazil. It is a second official language of the Argentine province of Corrientes since 2004 and the Brazilian city of Tacuru since 2010. Guarani is also one of the three official languages of Mercosur, alongside Spanish and Portuguese.\nGuarani is one of the most widely spoken Native American languages and remains commonly used among the Paraguayan people and neighboring communities. This is unique among American languages; language shift towards European colonial languages (in this case, the other official language of Spanish) has otherwise been a nearly universal phenomenon in the Western Hemisphere, but Paraguayans have maintained their traditional language while also adopting Spanish.\nThe name \"Guarani\" is generally used for the official language of Paraguay. However, this is part of a dialect chain, most of whose components are also often called Guarani.\nHistory.\nWhile Guarani, in its Classical form, was the only language spoken in the expansive missionary territories, Paraguayan Guarani has its roots outside of the Jesuit Reductions.\nModern scholarship has shown that Guarani was always the primary language of colonial Paraguay, both inside and outside the reductions. Following the expulsion of the Jesuits in the 18th century, the residents of the reductions gradually migrated north and west towards Asunci\u00f3n, a demographic shift that brought about a decidedly one-sided shift away from the Jesuit dialect that the missionaries had curated in the southern and eastern territories of the colony.\nBy and large, the Guarani of the Jesuits shied away from direct phonological loans from Spanish. Instead, the missionaries relied on the agglutinative nature of the language to formulate new precise translations or calque terms from Guarani morphemes. This process often led the Jesuits to employ complicated, highly synthetic terms to convey European concepts. By contrast, the Guarani spoken outside of the missions was characterized by a free, unregulated flow of Hispanicisms; frequently, Spanish words and phrases were simply incorporated into Guarani with minimal phonological adaptation.\nA good example of that phenomenon is found in the word \"communion\". The Jesuits, using their agglutinative strategy, rendered this word \", a calque based on the word \", meaning God. In modern Paraguayan Guarani, the same word is rendered \"\".\nFollowing the out-migration from the reductions, these two distinct dialects of Guarani came into extensive contact for the first time. The vast majority of speakers abandoned the less colloquial, highly regulated Jesuit variant in favor of the variety that evolved from actual use by speakers in Paraguay. This contemporary form of spoken Guarani is known as Jopar\u00e1, meaning \"mixture\" in Guarani.\nPolitical status.\nWidely spoken, Paraguayan Guarani has nevertheless been repressed by Paraguayan governments throughout most of its history since independence. It was prohibited in state schools for over 100 years. However, populists often used pride in the language to excite nationalistic fervor and promote a narrative of social unity.\nDuring the autocratic regime of Alfredo Stroessner, his Colorado Party used the language to appeal to common Paraguayans although Stroessner himself never gave an address in Guarani. Upon the advent of Paraguayan democracy in 1992, Guarani was established in the new constitution as a language equal to Spanish.\nJopar\u00e1, the mixture of Spanish and Guarani, is spoken by an estimated 90% of the population of Paraguay. Code-switching between the two languages takes place on a spectrum in which more Spanish is used for official and business-related matters, and more Guarani is used in art and in everyday life.\nGuarani is also an official language of Bolivia and of Corrientes Province in Argentina.\nPhonology.\nGuarani syllables consist of a consonant plus a vowel or a vowel alone; syllables ending in a consonant or containing two or more consonants together do not occur. This is represented as \"(C)V\".\nIn the below table, the IPA value is shown. The orthography is shown in angle brackets below, if different.\nConsonants.\nThe voiced consonants have oral allophones (left) before oral vowels, and nasal allophones (right) before nasal vowels. The oral allophones of the voiced stops are prenasalized.\nSome linguists additionally include the phoneme (written \u27e8nt\u27e9), though it is considered controversial as it appears exclusively in the suffix \"-nte\". Nonetheless, it is typically included in the Guarani alphabet.\nOral may be realized as , , , , , depending on the dialect, but the nasal allophone is always .\nThe palato-alveolar sibilant is often articulated closer to alveolo-palatal .\nThe dorsal fricative is in free variation between and .\nThe approximant may be nasalized and partially labialized , and may also be realized as a fricative or a fully labialized approximant .\nFrom Spanish loanwords, what had originally been a typical alveolar trill (written \u27e8rr\u27e9) became a retroflex sibilant . The alveolar lateral also entered Guarani phonology through Spanish loanwords, but is now a typical phoneme (unlike , which is considered marginal). The consonants , , and may also appear in loanwords.\nAll syllables are open, viz. CV or V, ending in a vowel.\nGlottal stop.\nThe glottal stop, called in Guarani, is only written between vowels, but occurs phonetically before vowel-initial words. Because of this, some words have several glottal stops near each other that consequently undergo a number of different dissimilation techniques. For example, \"I drink water\" is pronounced . This suggests that irregularity in verb forms derives from regular sound change processes in the history of Guarani. There also seems to be some degree of variation between how much the glottal stop is dropped (for example for \"I bring\"). It is possible that word-internal glottal stops may have been retained from fossilized compounds where the second component was a vowel-initial (and therefore glottal stop\u2013initial) root.\nVowels.\n correspond more or less to the Spanish and IPA equivalents, although sometimes the open-mid allophones , are used more frequently. The grapheme \u27e8y\u27e9 represents the vowel . Considering nasality, the vowel system is perfectly symmetrical, each oral vowel having a nasal counterpart (most systems with nasals have fewer nasals than orals).\nNasal harmony.\nGuarani displays an unusual degree of nasal harmony. A nasal syllable consists of a nasal vowel, and if the consonant is voiced, it takes its nasal allophone. If a stressed syllable is nasal, the nasality spreads in \"both\" directions until it bumps up against a stressed syllable that is oral. This includes affixes, postpositions, and compounding. Voiceless consonants do not have nasal allophones, but they do not interrupt the spread of nasality.\nFor example,\n \u2192 \nHowever, a second stressed syllable, with an oral vowel, will not become nasalized:\n \u2192 \nThat is, for a word with a single stressed vowel, all voiced segments will be either oral or nasal, while voiceless consonants are unaffected, as in oral vs nasal .\nGrammar.\nGuarani is a highly agglutinative language, often classified as polysynthetic. It is a fluid-S type active language, and it has been classified as a 6th class language in Milewski's typology. It uses subject\u2013verb\u2013object (SVO) word order usually, but object\u2013verb when the subject is not specified.\nNouns.\nGuarani exhibits nominal tense: past, expressed with , and future, expressed with . For example, translates to \"ex-president\" while translates to \"president-elect.\" The past morpheme is often translated as \"ex-\", \"former\", \"abandoned\", \"what was once\", or \"one-time\". These morphemes can even be combined to express the idea of something that was going to be but did not end up happening. So for example, is \"a person who studied to be a priest but didn't actually finish\", or rather, \"the ex-future priest\". Some nouns use instead of and others use instead of .\nPronouns.\nGuarani distinguishes between inclusive and exclusive pronouns of the first person plural.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReflexive pronoun: : (\"I look\"), (\"I look at myself\")\nConjugation.\nGuarani stems can be divided into a number of conjugation classes, which are called (with the subclass ) and . The names for these classes stem from the names of the prefixes for 1st and 2nd person singular.\nThe conjugation is used to convey that the participant is actively involved, whereas the conjugation is used to convey that the participant is the undergoer. However, the conjugation is also used if an intransitive verb expresses an event as opposed to a state, for example 'die', and even with a verb such as 'sleep'. In addition, all borrowed Spanish verbs are adopted as as opposed to borrowed adjectives, which take . Intransitive verbs can take either conjugation, transitive verbs normally take , but can take for habitual readings. Nouns can also be conjugated, but only as . This conveys a predicative possessive reading.\nFurthermore, the conjugations vary slightly according to the stem being oral or nasal.\nNegation.\nNegation is indicated by a circumfix in Guarani. The preverbal portion of the circumfix is for oral bases and for nasal bases. For 2nd person singular, an epenthetic is inserted before the base, for 1st person plural inclusive, an epenthetic is inserted.\nThe postverbal portion is for bases ending in , and for all others. However, in spoken Guarani, the portion of the circumfix is frequently omitted for bases ending in .\nThe negation can be used in all tenses, but for future or irrealis reference, the normal tense marking is replaced by , resulting in -base- as in , \"I won't do it\".\nThere are also other negatives, such as: , , , , .\nTense and aspect morphemes.\nThe verb form without suffixes at all is a present somewhat aorist: , \"that day you got out and you went far\".\nThese two suffixes can be added together: , \"I'm already going\".\nThis suffix can be joined with , making up : , \"now we came to know all your thought\".\nThese are unstressed suffixes: ; so the stress goes upon the last syllable of the verb or the last stressed syllable.\nSpanish loans in Guarani.\nThe close and prolonged contact Spanish and Guarani have experienced has resulted in many Guarani words of Spanish origin. Many of these loans were for things or concepts unknown to the New World prior to Spanish colonization. Examples are seen below:\nGuarani loans in English.\nEnglish has adopted a small number of words from Guarani (or perhaps the related Tupi) via Portuguese, mostly the names of animals or plants. \"Jaguar\" comes from and \"pira\u00f1a\" comes from (\"tooth fish\" Tupi: 'fish', 'tooth'). Other words are: \"agouti\" from (which means \"individual that eats standing up\"), \"tapir\" from , \"coati\" from \"kuat\u0129\" (which means \"what is scratched, or gashed; what has stripes across the body\"), \"a\u00e7a\u00ed\" from (\"[fruit that] cries or expels water\"), \"warrah\" from meaning \"fox\", and \"margay\" from meaning \"small cat\". Jacaranda \n(y-ac\u00e3-rat\u00e3, \"that which has a firm core or heartwood\" or \"hard-headed\"), guarana and manioc are words of Guarani or Tupi\u2013Guarani origin. Ipecacuanha (the name of a medicinal drug) comes from a homonymous Tupi\u2013Guarani name that can be rendered as , meaning a creeping plant that makes one vomit. \"Cougar\" is borrowed from Guarani \"guazu ara\".\nThe name of Paraguay is itself a Guarani word, as is the name of Uruguay. However, the exact meaning of either placename is subject to varied interpretations.

Ground effect is relevant for fixed-wing aircraft, rotorcraft, VTOL/STOL, and ground vehicles. Ground effect reduces drag by 40\u201350%, improving aircraft lift-to-drag ratios to 20\u201330, compared to 15\u201320 for conventional aircraft.\nThe principal benefit of operating in ground effect is to reduce its lift-induced drag. The closer the wing operates to a surface such as the ground, when it is said to be in ground effect, the less drag it experiences. When an aircraft enters ground effect, the surface pushes back against the downwash, which reduces its drag. \nDuring takeoff, ground effect can cause an aircraft to \"float\" while accelerating towards the climb speed, reducing friction.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nVehicle type.\nFor rotorcraft, ground effect results in less drag on the rotor while hovering near the ground. At high weights this may allow lift off while stationary in ground effect, but does not allow it to transition to flight while in ground effect. Helicopter pilots are provided with performance charts that show the limitations for hovering their helicopter in ground effect (IGE) and out of ground effect (OGE). The charts show the added lift benefit produced by ground effect.\nFor fan and jet-powered vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) aircraft, ground effect when hovering can cause suckdown and fountain lift on the airframe and loss in hovering thrust if the engine sucks in its own exhaust gas, which is known as hot gas ingestion (HGI).\nFixed-wing aircraft.\nWhen an aircraft flies at or below approximately half the length of the aircraft's wingspan above the ground or water there occurs an often-noticeable \"ground effect.\" The result is lower induced drag on the aircraft. This is caused primarily by the ground or water obstructing the creation of wingtip vortices, reducing downwash behind the wing as well as the upwash in front of the wing.\nThe nearer the wing is to the ground, the more pronounced the ground effect becomes. While in the ground effect, the wing requires a lower angle of attack to produce the same amount of lift, concurrently the wing also experiences a reduction in drag. In wind tunnel tests, in which the angle of attack and airspeed remain constant, an increase in the lift coefficient ensues, which combined with the reduced drag accounts for the \"floating\" effect experienced by pilots.\nLow winged aircraft are more affected by ground effect than high wing aircraft. Due to the change in up-wash, down-wash, and wingtip vortices, there may be errors in the airspeed system while in ground effect due to changes in the local pressure at the static source.\nRotorcraft.\nWhen a hovering rotor is near the ground the downward flow of air through the rotor is reduced to zero at the ground. This condition is transferred up to the disc through pressure changes in the wake which decreases the inflow to the rotor for a given disc loading, which is rotor thrust for each square foot of its area. This gives a thrust increase for a particular blade pitch angle, or, alternatively, the power required for a thrust is reduced. For an overloaded helicopter that can only hover IGE it may be possible to climb away from the ground by translating to forward flight first while in ground effect. The ground-effect benefit disappears rapidly with speed but the induced power decreases rapidly as well to allow a safe climb. Some early underpowered helicopters could only hover close to the ground. Ground effect is at its maximum over a firm, smooth surface.\nVTOL aircraft.\nThere are two effects inherent to VTOL aircraft operating at zero and low speeds in ground effect, suckdown and fountain lift. A third, hot gas ingestion, may also apply to fixed-wing aircraft on the ground in windy conditions or during thrust reverser operation. How well, in terms of weight lifted, a VTOL aircraft hovers IGE depends on suckdown on the air frame, fountain impingement on the underside of the fuselage and HGI into the engine causing inlet temperature rise (ITR). Suckdown works against the engine lift as a downward force on the airframe. Fountain flow works with the engine lift jets as an upwards force. The severity of the HGI problem becomes clear when the level of ITR is converted into engine thrust loss, three to four percent per 12.222\u00a0\u00b0c inlet temperature rise.\nSuckdown is the result of entrainment of air around aircraft by lift jets when hovering. It also occurs in free air (OGE) causing loss of lift by reducing pressures on the underside of the fuselage and wings. Enhanced entrainment occurs when close to the ground giving higher lift loss. Fountain lift occurs when an aircraft has two or more lift jets. The jets strike the ground and spread out. Where they meet under the fuselage they mix and can only move upwards striking the underside of the fuselage. How well their upward momentum is diverted sideways or downward determines the lift. Fountain flow follows a curved fuselage underbody and retains some momentum in an upward direction so less than full fountain lift is captured unless lift improvement devices are fitted. HGI reduces engine thrust because the air entering the engine is hotter and less dense than cold air.\nEarly VTOL experimental aircraft operated from open grids to channel away the engine exhaust and prevent thrust loss from HGI.\nThe Bell X-14, built to research early VTOL technology, was unable to hover until suckdown effects were reduced by raising the aircraft with longer landing gear legs. It also had to operate from an elevated platform of perforated steel to reduce HGI. The Dassault Mirage IIIV VTOL research aircraft only ever operated vertically from a grid which allowed engine exhaust to be channeled away from the aircraft to avoid suckdown and HGI effects.\nVentral strakes retroactively fitted to the P.1127 improved flow and increased pressure under the belly in low altitude hovering. Gun pods fitted in the same position on the production Harrier GR.1/GR.3 and the AV-8A Harrier did the same thing. Further lift improvement devices (LIDS) were developed for the AV-8B and Harrier II. To box in the belly region where the lift-enhancing fountains strike the aircraft, strakes were added to the underside of the gun pods and a hinged dam could be lowered to block the gap between the front ends of the strakes. This gave a 1200\u00a0lb lift gain.\nLockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II weapons-bay inboard doors on the F-35B open to capture fountain flow created by the engine and fan lift jets and counter suckdown IGE.\nWing stall in ground effect.\nThe stalling angle of attack is less in ground effect, by approximately 2\u20134 degrees, than in free air. When the flow separates there is a large increase in drag. If the aircraft overrotates on take-off at too low a speed the increased drag can prevent the aircraft from leaving the ground. Two de Havilland Comets overran the end of the runway after overrotating. Loss of control may occur if one wing tip stalls in ground effect. During certification testing of the Gulfstream G650 business jet the test aircraft rotated to an angle beyond the predicted IGE stalling angle. The over-rotation caused one wing-tip to stall and an uncommanded roll, which overpowered the lateral controls, leading to loss of the aircraft.\nGround-effect vehicle.\nA few vehicles have been designed to explore the performance advantages of flying in ground effect, mainly over water. The operational disadvantages of flying very close to the surface have discouraged widespread applications.\nReferences.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Younger brother of Robert Rich, 2nd Earl of Warwick, a Puritan activist and commander of the Parliamentarian navy during the Wars of the Three Kingdoms, Henry was better known as an \"extravagant, decorative, quarrelsome and highly successful courtier\". \nA close friend of Charles I and his favourite the Duke of Buckingham, Rich performed various diplomatic errands, including negotiations for Charles' marriage to Henrietta Maria of France in 1625. He took part in the unsuccessful attack on Saint-Martin-de-R\u00e9 in 1627 and held a number of important positions at court during the 1630s. When the First English Civil War began in August 1642, Rich remained in London rather than joining the Royalists, but like other moderates became disillusioned with the war. He defected in July 1643 after failing to persuade his cousin and commander-in-chief of the Parliamentarian army, Robert Devereux, 3rd Earl of Essex, to negotiate peace terms. \nWhen Charles agreed a truce with the Catholic Confederation in September 1643, Rich returned to London and narrowly escaped being tried for treason. After peace talks between Charles and Parliament broke down in late 1647, he fought for the Royalists in the Second English Civil War and was captured in July 1648. Having escaped trial previously, he was executed in March 1649, although Rich claimed he had always been faithful to Parliament and never changed the \"principles that ever I professed\". This was a view shared by many Parliamentarian moderates, particularly after the Execution of Charles I in January 1649.\nEarly life.\nHenry Rich, later Lord Holland, was the second son and youngest of four children born to Robert Rich, 1st Earl of Warwick (1559\u20131619) and his first wife Penelope (1563\u20131607). His parents separated soon after Henry's birth, although they did not formally divorce until 1605, when Penelope married her long-time partner, Charles Blount, 8th Baron Mountjoy (1563\u20131606). Penelope was sister of the Earl of Essex, executed for treason in 1601, making Rich a cousin to future Parliamentarian general Robert Devereux, 3rd Earl of Essex. \nHe had two sisters, Essex (1585\u20131658) and Lettice (1587\u20131619) and a brother Robert Rich, 2nd Earl of Warwick (1587\u20131658). He also had a number of half brothers and sisters, including Penelope (b. 1592), Isabella, Mountjoy Blount, 1st Earl of Newport (1597\u20131666), and Charles (1605\u20131627). Almost certainly fathered by Charles Mountjoy, these children were brought up within the Rich family and appear in its pedigree, with the exception of Mountjoy, who was legitimised after his father's death. \nHis father Robert was the wealthiest landowner in Essex, created Earl of Warwick in 1618, and a prominent supporter of reforms within the Church of England, as were his sons. However, while his elder brother was a devout Puritan throughout his life, Henry acquired a reputation as an \"extravagant, decorative, quarrelsome and highly successful courtier\". \nIn 1612, he married Isabel Cope, whose dowry included Cope House in Kensington. This was greatly expanded by Rich in 1624 to 1625 and renamed Holland House; largely destroyed in 1940, parts of the original house still remain. They had numerous children, including Frances (1617\u20131672), who married William Paget, 5th Baron Paget, Robert (1619\u20131675), Henry (1620\u20131669), Isabella (1623\u20131670), Susannah (1628\u20131649), Diana (d. 1659), Charles (d. 1645), Cope (1635\u20131676) and Mary (1636\u20131666). Several of the family tombs are at St Mary Abbots Church, Kensington.\nCareer; pre-1639.\nRich was educated at Eton and graduated from Emmanuel College, Cambridge in 1603. Reportedly a godson of Henry IV of France, he travelled to Paris in 1607 before returning to England in 1610. Elected as MP for the vacant seat of Leicester in May, he was knighted in June when James I's heir Henry was created Prince of Wales. Shortly thereafter, he served as a volunteer in the Siege of J\u00fclich (1610), part of the War of the J\u00fclich Succession which preceded the wider conflict of the Thirty Years' War. \nAs was then common, Rich completed his education by studying law at the Inner Temple in 1611 and was re-elected for Leicester in the short-lived Addled Parliament of 1614. Clarendon later wrote he was ideally suited to the Jacobean era court, being \"a very handsome man, of a lovely and winning presence\". However, wealth was also a prerequisite; his father-in-law Sir Walter Cope died in 1614 with debts of over \u00a327,000, greatly impacting Rich's ability to advance. \nRich became close to Charles, installed as heir to the throne when Prince Henry died in 1612, as well as his favourite, the Duke of Buckingham. He took part in various diplomatic missions and briefly served as a volunteer in the Eighty Years War, before being created Baron Kensington in 1623. The next year he was made a member of the Privy Council of England, and sent to Paris to help negotiate the marriage contract between Charles and Henrietta Maria of France, a process completed by James Hay. When Charles succeeded his father in March 1625, Hay was made Earl of Carlisle and Rich Earl of Holland, taking his title from an area in Lincolnshire. \nIn 1627, Rich was involved in the disastrous Siege of Saint-Martin-de-R\u00e9, which led to Buckingham's impeachment by Parliament; although this failed, he was assassinated on 23 August 1628. The next day, Rich wrote to Charles claiming he had been promised the position Governor of Windsor Castle. This request was granted, along with an appointment as Governor of Landguard Fort, and he benefited from his relationship with Henrietta Maria, who had replaced Buckingham as Charles' closest advisor. Over the next few months, he was made Lord Lieutenant of Berkshire and Middlesex, Chancellor of the University of Cambridge, and numerous other offices. \nAlthough he failed to become First Lord of the Admiralty, the 1630s was the highpoint of his career as a courtier; as a Privy councillor, he was frequently consulted on foreign affairs, although his anti-Spanish policy was at odds with that pursued by Charles. In 1636, he was appointed Groom of the Stool; by this stage the term indicated proximity to the monarch rather than function, and the officeholder was an important part of the Royal household. \nCareer; Wars of the Three Kingdoms.\nDespite his close links to the court and reputation for extravagance and ambition, Lord Conway described Rich and his brother Warwick as the \"temporal and spiritual heads of the Puritans\". This shows the danger of conflating \"Roundhead\" and \"Puritan\", which often implied a political outlook as much as a moral one. While the majority supported Parliament during the civil war, men like Sir William Savile were equally opposed to Catholicism but became Royalists out of a sense of personal loyalty. \nRich used his patronage to appoint \"Godly\" clergy, while opposing Laudianism and \"Popery\", causing a breach with Henrietta Maria, who was a devout Catholic. In addition, he supported two causes central to the Puritan movement, the first being the restoration of Charles' Protestant nephew, Charles I Louis, Elector Palatine, to his hereditary lands in the Electoral Palatinate. \nThe second was participation in the colonial movement, which sought to establish English possessions in the West Indies and North America, then dominated by Spain. Rich supported colonies in Virginia and Bermuda and from 1630 to 1642 was governor of the Providence Island Company. While his attendance at company meetings was irregular, he helped secure funding and support for its activities, including Privateer attacks on Spanish merchant ships. Many of his colleagues were leaders of the Parliamentarian opposition in 1641, including John Pym, John Hampden, Lord Saye and Lord Brooke. \nThe Wars of the Three Kingdoms began in 1639 with the first of the two Bishops' Wars against the Scots Covenanters; Rich served as General of Horse in a chaotic campaign that ended without significant action. A second defeat in 1640 forced Charles to recall Parliament in November, which impeached both Archbishop Laud and the Earl of Strafford. A long-time opponent of Strafford, Rich gave evidence against him but abstained from the vote which led to his execution in May 1641. \nAlthough Charles appointed him commander of the militia in Northern England, Rich sided with Parliament at the start of the First English Civil War in August 1642. Many on both sides expected a short, relatively bloodless conflict and were shocked by the casualties incurred at Edgehill in October 1642. In early 1643, Rich tried to persuade his cousin and Army commander Robert Devereux, 3rd Earl of Essex to force Parliament to make peace; when this failed, he defected to the Royalists at Oxford. Although present at Newbury in September, he was treated with indifference by Charles and returned to Westminster in November, reportedly because he opposed the \"Cessation\" negotiated by Royalists in Ireland with the Catholic Confederacy. \nHe resumed his seat in the House of Lords, while an attempt to impeach him for treason was blocked by Denzil Holles, head of the \"Peace\" faction in Parliament. Rich was one of ten lords appointed to the Westminster Assembly, a body established with Scottish representatives to agree reforms for the Church of England. By the time Charles surrendered in June 1646, his opponents were divided between moderates led by Holles who dominated Parliament and radicals within the New Model Army, headed by Oliver Cromwell. After negotiations between the king and Parliament broke down in late 1647, the Scots, English moderates and Royalists created an alliance to restore Charles to the throne. The Second English Civil War began in April 1648.\nOn 4 July, a petition was presented to Parliament demanding the resumption of negotiations with Charles, and on the same day, Rich and George Villiers, 2nd Duke of Buckingham raised 400 cavalry in an attempt to seize London. This was insufficient for the task and the Royalists retreated through Surrey, before being intercepted and scattered outside Surbiton by Sir Michael Livesey. Rich and 200 men reached St Neots on Sunday 9 July, along with Colonel John Dalbier, an experienced German mercenary who served with him in the 1627 Saint-Martin-de-R\u00e9 expedition. \nThe next day, they were attacked by a detachment from the New Model under Colonel Adrian Scrope; Dalbier was killed, Buckingham escaped to France and Rich taken prisoner to Windsor Castle. The war ended with Parliamentarian victory at Preston in August, followed by the Execution of Charles I on 30 January 1649. On 27 February, Rich was taken to London for trial; many felt he should have been punished in 1643 and despite pleas from his brother Warwick, he was executed on 9 March along with Lord Capell and the Duke of Hamilton.\nShortly before his death, Rich composed a statement arguing he had always been faithful to Parliament, a \"remarkable claim for someone who had deserted them twice\". However, the suggestion he never changed the \"principles that ever I professed\" and was more consistent than those responsible for executing Charles was a view shared by many Parliamentarian moderates.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

At an elevation of , it is the second-highest peak in the Cascades and the fifth-highest in the state. Mount Shasta has an estimated volume of , which makes it the most voluminous stratovolcano in the Cascade Volcanic Arc.\nThe mountain and surrounding area are part of the Shasta\u2013Trinity National Forest.\nDescription.\nThe origin of the name \"Shasta\" is vague, either derived from a people of a name like it or otherwise garbled by early Westerners. Mount Shasta is connected to its satellite cone of Shastina, and together they dominate the landscape. Shasta rises abruptly to tower nearly above its surroundings. On a clear winter day, the mountain can be seen from the floor of the Central Valley to the south. The mountain has attracted the attention of poets, authors, and presidents.\nThe mountain consists of four overlapping dormant volcanic cones that have built a complex shape, including the main summit and the prominent and visibly conical satellite cone of Shastina. If Shastina were a separate mountain, it would rank as the fourth-highest peak of the Cascade Range (after Mount Rainier, Rainier's Liberty Cap, and Mount Shasta itself).\nMount Shasta's surface is relatively free of deep glacial erosion except, paradoxically, for its south side where Sargents Ridge runs parallel to the U-shaped Avalanche Gulch. This is the largest glacial valley on the volcano, although it does not now have a glacier in it. There are seven named glaciers on Mount Shasta, with the four largest (Whitney, Bolam, Hotlum, and Wintun) radiating down from high on the main summit cone to below primarily on the north and east sides. The Whitney Glacier is the longest, and the Hotlum is the most voluminous glacier in the state of California. Three of the smaller named glaciers occupy cirques near and above on the south and southeast sides, including the Watkins, Konwakiton, and Mud Creek glaciers.\nHistory.\nThe first written record and description was made on May 20, 1817, by Spaniard Narciso Dur\u00e1n, a member of the Luis Antonio Arg\u00fcello expedition into the upper areas of the Sacramento River Valley, who wrote \"At about ten leagues to the northwest of this place we saw the very high hill called by soldiers that went near its slope Jesus Maria, It is entirely covered with snow.\" Peter Skene Ogden (a leader of a Hudson's Bay Company trapping brigade) in 1826 recorded sighting the mountain, and in 1827, the name \"Sasty\" or \"Sastise\" was given to nearby Mount McLoughlin by Ogden. An 1839 map by David Burr lists the mountain as Rogers Peak. This name was apparently dropped, and the name Shasta was transferred to present-day Mount Shasta in 1841, partly as a result of work by the United States Exploring Expedition.\nBeginning in the 1820s, Mount Shasta was a prominent landmark along what became known as the Siskiyou Trail, which runs at Mount Shasta's base. The Siskiyou Trail was on the track of an ancient trade and travel route of Native American footpaths between California's Central Valley and the Pacific Northwest.\nThe California Gold Rush brought the first Euro-American settlements into the area in the early 1850s, including at Yreka, California and Upper Soda Springs. The first recorded ascent of Mount Shasta occurred in 1854 (by Elias Pearce), after several earlier failed attempts. In 1856, the first women (Harriette Eddy, Mary Campbell McCloud, and their party) reached the summit.\nBy the 1860s and 1870s, Mount Shasta was the subject of scientific and literary interest. In 1854 John Rollin Ridge titled a poem \"Mount Shasta.\" A book by California pioneer and entrepreneur James Hutchings, titled \"Scenes of Wonder and Curiosity in California\", contained an account of an early summit trip in 1855. The summit was achieved (or nearly so) by John Muir, Josiah Whitney, Clarence King, and John Wesley Powell. In 1877, Muir wrote a dramatic popular article about his surviving an overnight blizzard on Mount Shasta by lying in the hot sulfur springs near the summit. This experience was inspiration to Kim Stanley Robinson's short story \"Muir on Shasta\".\nThe 1887 completion of the Central Pacific Railroad, built along the line of the Siskiyou Trail between California and Oregon, brought a substantial increase in tourism, lumbering, and population into the area around Mount Shasta. Early resorts and hotels, such as Shasta Springs and Upper Soda Springs, grew up along the Siskiyou Trail around Mount Shasta, catering to these early adventuresome tourists and mountaineers.\nIn the early 20th century, the Pacific Highway followed the track of the Siskiyou Trail to the base of Mount Shasta, leading to still more access to the mountain. Today's version of the Siskiyou Trail, Interstate 5, brings thousands of people each year to Mount Shasta.\nFrom February 13\u201319, 1959, the Mount Shasta Ski Bowl obtained the record for the most snowfall during one storm in the U.S., with a total of .\nMount Shasta was declared a National Natural Landmark in December 1976.\nThe \"Shasta Gulch\" is referenced in the lyrics to the 1994 song \"Unfair\" by cult indie rock band Pavement.\nLegends.\nThe lore of some of the Klamath Tribes in the area held that Mount Shasta is inhabited by the Spirit of the Above-World, Skell, who descended from heaven to the mountain's summit at the request of a Klamath chief. Skell fought with Spirit of the Below-World, Llao, who resided at Mount Mazama, by throwing hot rocks and lava, probably representing the volcanic eruptions at both mountains.\nItalian settlers arrived in the early 1900s to work in the mills as stonemasons and established a strong Catholic presence in the area. There are many religious sites in the area; Mount Shasta City and Dunsmuir, California, small towns near Shasta's western base, are focal points for many of these, which range from a Buddhist monastery (Shasta Abbey, founded by Houn Jiyu-Kennett in 1971) to modern-day Native American rituals. A group of Native Americans from the McCloud River area practice rituals on the mountain.\nMount Shasta has also been a focus for non-Native American legends, centered on a hidden city of advanced beings from the lost continent of Lemuria. The legend grew from an offhand mention of Lemuria in the 1880s to a description of a hidden Lemurian village in 1925. In 1931 Harvey Spencer Lewis, using the pseudonym Wishar S[penle] Cerve, wrote \"Lemuria: The Lost Continent of the Pacific\", published by AMORC, about the hidden Lemurians of Mount Shasta, which cemented the legend in many readers' minds. A 1941 novella by Robert A. Heinlein, \"Lost Legacy\", drew on these legends and portrayed the mountain as the home of a community of peaceful and powerful \"adepts\" who had the goal of advancing the human race.\nIn 2024 a 20-foot bronze statue of the Virgin Mary was built in the Ski Park in memory of Ray Merlo, husband and business partner of the Ski Park's owner, Robin Merlo. Ray Merlo had died from cancer in 2020.\nGeology.\nAbout 593,000 years ago, andesitic lavas erupted in what is now Mount Shasta's western flank near McBride Spring. Over time, an ancestral Mount Shasta stratovolcano was built to a large but unknown height; sometime between 300,000 and 360,000 years ago the entire north side of the volcano collapsed, creating an enormous landslide or debris avalanche, in volume. The slide flowed northwestward into Shasta Valley, where the Shasta River now cuts through the flow.\nWhat remains of the oldest of Mount Shasta's four cones is exposed at Sargents Ridge on the south side of the mountain. Lavas from the Sargents Ridge vent cover the Everitt Hill shield at Mount Shasta's southern foot. The last lavas to erupt from the vent were hornblende-pyroxene andesites with a hornblende dacite dome at its summit. Glacial erosion has since modified its shape.\nThe next cone to form is exposed south of Mount Shasta's current summit and is called Misery Hill. It was formed 15,000 to 20,000 years ago from pyroxene andesite flows and has since been intruded by a hornblende dacite dome.\nThere are many buried glacial scars on the mountain that were created in recent glacial periods (\"ice ages\") of the present Wisconsinian glaciation. Most have since been filled in with andesite lava, pyroclastic flows, and talus from lava domes. Shastina, by comparison, has a fully intact summit crater indicating Shastina developed after the last ice age. Shastina has been built by mostly pyroxene andesite lava flows. Some 9,500 years ago, these flows reached about south and north of the area now occupied by nearby Black Butte. The last eruptions formed Shastina's present summit about a hundred years later. But before that, Shastina, along with the then forming Black Butte dacite plug dome complex to the west, created numerous pyroclastic flows that covered , including large parts of what is now Mount Shasta, California and Weed, California. Diller Canyon ( deep and wide) is an avalanche chute that was probably carved into Shastina's western face by these flows.\nThe last to form, and the highest cone, the Hotlum Cone, formed about 8,000 years ago. It is named after the Hotlum glacier on its northern face; its longest lava flow, the Military Pass flow, extends down its northeast face. Since the creation of the Hotlum Cone, a dacite dome intruded the cone and now forms the summit. The rock at the summit crater has been extensively hydrothermally altered by sulfurous hot springs and fumaroles there (only a few examples still remain).\nIn the last 8,000 years, the Hotlum Cone has erupted at least eight or nine times. About 200 years ago, the last significant Mount Shasta eruption came from this cone and created a pyroclastic flow, a hot lahar (mudflow), and three cold lahars, which streamed down Mount Shasta's east flank via Ash Creek. A separate hot lahar went down Mud Creek. This eruption was thought to have been observed by the explorer La P\u00e9rouse, from his ship off the California coast, in 1786, but this has been disputed.\nVolcanic status.\nDuring the last 10,000 years, Mount Shasta has erupted an average of every 800 years, but in the past 4,500 years the volcano has erupted an average of every 600 years.\nUSGS seismometers and GPS receivers operated by UNAVCO form the monitoring network for Mount Shasta. The volcano has been relatively quiet during the 21st century, with only a handful of small magnitude earthquakes and no demonstrable ground deformation. Although geophysically quiet, periodic geochemical surveys indicate that volcanic gas emanates from a fumarole at the summit of Mount Shasta from a deep-seated reservoir of partly molten rock.\nMount Shasta can release volcanic ash, pyroclastic flows or dacite and andesite lava. Its deposits can be detected under nearby small towns. Mount Shasta has an explosive, eruptive history. There are fumaroles on the mountain, which show Mount Shasta is still alive.\nThe worst-case scenario for an eruption is a large pyroclastic flow, similar to that which occurred in the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens. Since there is ice, such as Whitney Glacier and Mud Creek Glacier, lahars would also result.\nThe United States Geological Survey monitors Mount Shasta and rates it as a very high-threat volcano.\nClimbing.\nThe summer climbing season runs from late April until October, although many attempts are made in the winter. Mount Shasta is also a popular destination for backcountry skiing. Many of the climbing routes can be descended by experienced skiers, and there are numerous lower-angled areas around the base of the mountain.\nNo quota system currently exists for climbing Mount Shasta, and reservations are not required. However, climbers must obtain a summit pass and a wilderness permit to climb the mountain.\nIn a typical season there are 1-3 climber deaths and a dozen rescues.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "76246", "revid": "494861", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=76246", "title": "Carloman of Bavaria", "text": "King of Bavaria from 876 to 879\nCarloman (, ; c. 830 \u2013 22 March 880) was a Frankish king of the Carolingian dynasty. He was the eldest son of Louis the German, king of East Francia, and Hemma, daughter of a Bavarian count. His father appointed him governor of Carantania in 856, and commander of southeastern frontier marches in 864. Upon his father's death in 876 he became king of Bavaria. He was appointed by King Louis II of Italy as his successor, but the Kingdom of Italy was taken by his uncle Charles the Bald in 875. Carloman only conquered it in 877. In 879 he was incapacitated, perhaps by a stroke, and abdicated his domains in favour of his younger brothers: Bavaria to Louis the Younger and Italy to Charles the Fat.\nEarly life.\nCarloman's birth date is unknown, but was probably around 828 or 830. His naming can be connected to his father's push to rule Alemannia around the time of his father's assembly of Worms in 829. The first member of the Carolingian dynasty named Carloman had ruled Alemannia in 741\u201348, and subjugated it to the Franks.\nCarloman was old enough to participate in the civil war of 840\u201343, waged between his father and his uncles, Lothair and Charles the Bald. His first record public appearance is as the leader of an army of reinforcements from Bavaria and Alemannia which he brought to his father at Worms in 842. He subsequently led them in battle alongside his father and uncle (Charles the Bald) against his other uncle (Lothair). It was the beginning of a warlike career. Notker of Saint Gall, who bewailed the decline of the dynasty a generation later, called Carloman \"bellicosissimus\" (literally \"most warlike\", or in historian Eric Goldberg's words a \"real ass-kicker\").\nIn October 848, Carloman was present at his father's council in Regensburg, where the Slavic commander (\"dux\") Pribina was rewarded for his service in defending the Bavarian frontier. In the charter confirming the grant, Carloman signed his name first among the secular magnates (after the ecclesiastics).\nIn the 840s, Carloman had a liaison with Liutswind, daughter of the Bavarian count Ratolt and sister-in-law of Count Sigihard of the Kraichgau. This was Carloman's first politically independent action, and it confirms his close connection to Bavaria. Around 850, Liutswind bore him a son, Arnulf. This name was chosen because it was distinctly dynastic (the founder of the Carolingian family was Bishop Arnulf of Metz), yet had never been used by a reigning king and was thus appropriate for an illegitimate eldest son. The choice of the name is the surest evidence that Liutswind and Carloman were not legally married. Around 860, Arnulf and his cousin, Hugh, the illegitimate son of Carloman's brother Louis, were both in Koblenz at the court of their grandfather, who was probably overseeing their military education and also holding them to ensure the good behaviour of their fathers.\nGuardian of the southeastern frontiers.\nIn 856, Louis first associated Carloman with his rule by appointing him governor of Carantania. According to the \"Annales Fuldenses\" (863), he was given the title \"prelate of the Carantanians\" (). Since this was his first governorship, Louis did not give him rule over the entire March of Pannonia, with traditional seat of frontier governor (prefect) at Tulln. Instead, Carloman was given rule over the inner region (Carantania), in order do gain experience, and perhaps because his father wanted to keep him from trying to seize too much power.\nGaining the first foothold of power in Carantania, Carloman moved to assume a more prominent role in governorship over the frontier regions of his father's realm. Starting from 857, Carloman was an occasional witness to his father's charters, and already in 858 he was appointed to lead a military expedition against the Great Moravia.\nIn 861, Carloman came into conflict with several frontier commanders in southeastern regions, expelled them from their offices, and replaced them with his loyals. That move was made without his fathers consent, and by 862 an open conflict erupted, with Carloman siding with Rastislav of Moravia and taking control over all southeastern regions, advancing further into Bavaria, up to the river Inn. An attempted reconciliation and truce between father and son failed, and in 863 king Louis invaded his son's territory, forced Carloman into submission, and took him into custody.\nReplaced by count Gundachar, who was appointed governor of eastern marches by king Louis (863), prince Carloman remained in his father custody until 864, when he escaped and returned to Carantania. Welcomed by supporters, he assumed power in the province. At that time, king Louis was campaigning against Moravia, but ceased further operations and moved south, towards Carantania. Conflict was avoided by reconciliation. Father and son met and reached an agreement. Carloman submitted to his father and in return he was granted governorship over eastern marches.\nCarloman's letter to his father from 869 survives, describing conditions on the frontier. In 870, he succeeded in establishing Frankish domination over Great Moravia, through arrangement with Svatopluk, who captured his uncle Rastislav of Moravia, ruling prince of Moravia, and gave him over to Carloman. During the following Frankish invasion, Moravian archbishop Methodius was also captured and sent to Carloman. In 871, he managed to capture Svatopluk, thus establishing direct control over the entire principality, but soon decided to reinstall him, in order to pacify the country. That proved to be disastrous, since Svatopluk, as soon as reaching Moravia, turned against Carloman, inflicting severe losses on Frankish army.\nIn 873, after several interventions of Pope John VIII, including those made to Carloman, a peace settlement was reached in Forchheim, between king Louis and envoys of Svatopluk, thus concluding the state of war on eastern borders.\nDivision of Frankfurt.\nIn order to prevent future dynastic conflicts, king Louis decided to regulate the position of his three sons within the government. In 865, an arrangement on the future succession was reached and promulgated in Frankfurt, thus becoming known as the \"Division of Frankfurt\". Bavaria and southeastern marches were designated to Carloman, Saxony and Franconia to Louis the Younger, and Alamannia to Charles the Fat. Princes were to become rulers of designated domains only upon their father's death. None of them was given the title of a king during his father's lifetime, but their position within the state affairs was regulated in detail, with king Louis keeping all of the main prerogatives of royal power.\nAt the same time, all of king's sons married into the local aristocracy of the regions marked out for them. Carloman married the daughter of a Bavarian military leader (\"dux\") named Ernest, whom the \"Annales Bertiniani\" describe as \"the greatest of all the king's great men\". This marriage must have taken place before Ernest's disgrace and dismissal in 861, for Louis the German strongly disapproved of his second son's seeking a marriage with family that had likewise been disgraced in 858\u201359.\nBy the 870s, according to the \"Annales Bertiniani\", at the time being composed by Archbishop Hincmar of Reims, Carloman's mother, Emma, was encouraging her husband to favour Carloman over his brothers. This is the first recorded involvement of Emma in politics, and it may relate to Louis's illness during 869\u201370. On the other hand, historian Ernst D\u00fcmmler thought Carloman must have been a \"mamma's boy\" (\"Mutters\u00f6hnchen\").\nRuler of Bavaria.\nIn Bavaria, Carloman re-founded the palace and monastery at \u00d6tting. He dedicated it to the Virgin Mary and \"numerous other saints whose relics we were able to collect with God's help\". He appointed his father's friend, the linguistic scholar Baldo, as his chancellor. In 878, he may have been the object of an assassination attempt. According to the \"Annales Iuvavenses\", the king \"was surrounded by Count Ermenpert and some of his soldiers\" at Ergolding, but the count apparently fled to West Francia, where he was received by Louis the Stammerer.\nCarloman groomed his illegitimate son Arnulf for the succession in Bavaria. In a charter issued at Regensburg, he called him \"regal son\" (\"filius regalis\"), a term similar to \"the king's son\" (\"filius regis\"), which was the standard title of a legitimate royal son. This policy had supporters, like Abbot Regino of Pr\u00fcm and the monks of Saint Gall, but also detractors, who appealed to Carloman's brother Louis. In early 879, Carloman was incapacitated by illness, perhaps a stroke. Louis came to Bavaria to receive the recognition of the aristocracy as future king. By Easter he had left, and Arnulf took control of the kingdom in his father's name. He dismissed some prominent counts, who appealed to Louis to restore them. Carloman tried to legitimise Arnulf's actions by adding his son's name to the prayer provisions of his charters, but in November Louis came to Bavaria to force a resolution of the succession. He restored the deposed counts and Carloman formally abdicated his Bavarian throne to his brother. He also placed Arnulf under Louis's protection. His brother Charles dated his reign in Italy from November 879, so presumably Carloman abdicated that kingdom at the same time as Bavaria.\nRuler of Italy.\nOn 12 August 875, Louis II of Italy died and his kingdom was claimed by Louis the German for his sons Carloman and Charles and by Charles the Bald. Pope John VIII, dealing with the constant threat of raiders from Muslim Sicily, sided with Charles the Bald. Carloman led an army into Italy, where he granted a diploma to the monastery of San Clemente a Casauria, one of Louis II's most favored houses. In the diploma Carloman declared himself Louis's chosen successor. According to the \"Annales Fuldenses\", Charles had to offer him \"a huge sum in gold and silver and precious stones\" to get him to leave Italy. On 28 August 876, Louis died and his sons became kings in their allotted kingdoms. On 6 October 877, Charles the Bald died and later that month Carloman succeeded in having himself elected King of Italy by the nobles assembled in Pavia. The lure of Italy was \"the looting which was apparently acceptable when a king first took over a kingdom\", providing rewards that could be shared out among followers and more than offset the cost of raising an army and crossing the Alps. Carloman was one of only two Carolingian kings of Italy\u2014his brother and successor Charles being the other\u2014who did not issue a capitulary at the beginning of his reign in order to proclaim his legitimacy and affirm his keeping to traditions of good government.\nIn Italy, Carloman confirmed his predecessor's act that made bishops permanent \"missi dominici\" (royal representatives) in their dioceses. He added to the new regulation by expanding the jurisdiction of individual bishops to gain their loyalty. His grant to Bishop Wibod of Parma of the \"districtio\", or temporal authority in the district outside the city walls, was the first grant of its kind to a bishop. By the time of Carloman's death, the confirmation of a predecessor's concessions to the episcopate and the negotiating of new ones in exchange for support had become an Italian tradition. In 876, Charles had granted Pope John jurisdictional rights in the duchies of Spoleto and Camerino. After his succession, Carloman supported the dukes, Lambert I and Guy III, who had always claimed the rights as royal representatives which Charles had offered the pope.\nIn 879, Carloman donated land to the monastery of Santa Cristina by the royal palace at Olona. Although the monastery was reportedly built during the eighth century, the first record of its dedication to Cristina is found in Carloman's charter. In a letter of 7 June 879, Pope John, having failed to convince Louis the Stammerer, Charles the Bald's heir, to come to Italy for its defence, appealed to Carloman, whom he had previously rejected. It was too late; by then Carloman was incapacitated. Shortly before his abdication, he granted a complex of estates around Olona to the church of San Sisto, which had been founded by Queen Engelberga in Piacenza.\nIn Italy, Carloman had \"denarii\" (pennies) minted at Milan and Pavia. Those minted at Milan generally bore the inscription , while those of Pavia bore . All had a stylised temple on one side. Carloman did not issue coinage in Bavaria.\nIllness and death.\nRegarding Carloman's condition, the \"Annales Fuldenses\" (879) record that he lost his voice, but was still able to communicate by writing. Regino of Pr\u00fcm, writing in his chronicle for the year 880, recalls that he was \"erudite in letters\" (\"litteris eruditus\"), which meant he could write Latin. Regino's entire encomium on Carloman goes:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;That most excellent king was learned in letters, devoted to the Christian religion, just, peaceful, and morally upright. The beauty of his body was exceptional, and his physical strength was a wonder to behold. He possessed a very warlike spirit. He waged numerous wars against the Slavic kingdoms with his father, and even more without him. He always returned the victor in triumph and expanded the borders of his empire with glorious iron. He was mild to his own men and a living terror to his enemies. He was charming in speech, humble, and endowed with great cleverness for managing the business of the realm. He was so skilled that he was the very embodiment of royal majesty.\nMost sources place Carloman's death in March 880, but the \"Annales Iuvavenses\" place it on 21 September. He was buried in the chapel of his palace at \u00d6tting. Carloman left one illegitimate son, Arnulf, who continued as margrave of Carinthia during the reigns of Carloman's brothers, but in 887 became king of East Francia and in 896 emperor.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The governor is the head of the executive branch of the government of Florida and is the commander-in-chief of the Florida National Guard and Florida State Guard.\nThe current officeholder is Ron DeSantis, a member of the Republican Party who took office on January 8, 2019.\nList of governors.\nMilitary governor.\nSpanish Florida was acquired from Spain in the Adams\u2013On\u00eds Treaty, which took effect July 10, 1821. Parts of West Florida had already been assigned to Alabama, Louisiana, and Mississippi; the remainder and East Florida were governed by a military commissioner with the powers of governor until the territory was organized and incorporated.\nTerritory of Florida.\nFlorida Territory was organized on March 30, 1822, combining East and West Florida.\nState of Florida.\nThe State of Florida was admitted to the Union on March 3, 1845. It seceded from the Union on January 10, 1861, and joined the Confederate States of America on February 8, 1861, as a founding member. Following the end of the American Civil War, it was part of the Third Military District. Florida was readmitted to the Union on June 25, 1868.\nThe Florida Constitution of 1838 provided that a governor be elected every 4 years, who was not allowed to serve consecutive terms. The secessionist constitution of 1861 would have reduced this to two years and removed the term limit, but the state fell to the Union before the first election under that constitution. The rejected constitution of 1865 and the ratified constitution of 1868 maintained the four-year term, though without the earlier term limit, which was reintroduced in the 1885 constitution. The current constitution of 1968 states that should the governor serve, or would have served had he not resigned, more than six years in two consecutive terms, he cannot be elected to the succeeding term. The start of a term was set in 1885 at the first Tuesday after the first Monday in the January following the election, where it has remained.\nOriginally, the president of the state senate acted as governor should that office be vacant. The 1865 and 1868 constitutions created the office of lieutenant governor, who would similarly act as governor. This office was abolished in 1885, with the president of the senate again taking on that duty. The 1968 constitution recreated the office of lieutenant governor, who now becomes governor in the absence of the governor. The governor and lieutenant governor are elected on the same ticket.\nFlorida was a strongly Democratic state before the Civil War, electing only one candidate from the Whig Party (the Democrats' chief opposition at the time). It elected three Republican governors following Reconstruction, but after the Democratic Party re-established control, 90 years passed before voters chose another Republican. Since 1998, it has been a strongly Republican state.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"template:sticky header/styles.css\"/&gt;\nActing governor.\nFlorida has had a number of people serve as acting governor. The state's first three constitutions provided that the succession in office became operative whenever the governor was out of the state. Thus, in 1853 when Governor Thomas Brown attended an event in Boston\u2014the Senate president who would normally succeed the governor at the time was also out of state. Therefore, the speaker of the Florida House of Representatives, A.K. Allison, became acting governor on September 16, 1853. He served for 17 days.\nArticle IV Section 3 (b) of the Florida Constitution now calls for the lieutenant governor to \"act as Governor\" during the governor's physical or mental incapacity. This provision has been invoked one time. On June 18, 2008, Governor Charlie Crist filed a proclamation with the secretary of state transferring power of governor to Lt. Governor Jeff Kottkamp pursuant to the constitutional provision while he underwent knee surgery.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
