At the 2020 US census, the population was 434,006. Its county seat is Sarasota and its largest city is North Port. Sarasota County is part of the North Port\u2013Bradenton\u2013Sarasota, FL metropolitan statistical area. The county includes barrier islands with beaches and beach communities. It is home to colleges, a network of libraries, and various parks and preserves. The area was home to indigenous peoples. Angola was a maroon settlement in its Bradenton area. Bertha Palmer owned substantial lands in the area including what is now Palmer Ranch.\nHistory.\nThe area that is now known as Sarasota County has been inhabited by humans for some 10,000 years. Evidence of human remains as well as a burned out log at the Warm Mineral Springs, in North Port, were discovered that date to the early Archaic period.\nAlthough the name was associated with the area from the beginning of European contacts, the origin of the name \"Sarasota\" is unknown. In the early twentieth-century, a fanciful story was created to go hand-in-hand with a pageant held in Sarasota. The story held that the town was named after the daughter of famous explorer Hernando de Soto's daughter Sara.\nAn early map of the area from 1763 shows the word \"Zarazote\" across present day Sarasota.\nFollowing exploration, the area was occupied by fishing camps, called ranchos. During the Second Seminole War, the area was occupied by the U.S. Army and Fort Armistead was built near Sarasota Bay. In 1842, the Armed Occupation Act was passed, which deeded land to settlers who were willing to cultivate and defend land in Florida. The act brought American settlers to Sarasota.\nSarasota County was created in 1921 from the southern part of Manatee County. After acquisition by the United States as a territory in 1819, the area now included in Sarasota county had been part of St. Johns County (1821), Alachua County (1824), Hillsborough County (1834), and Manatee County (1855) as new counties were created from older counties to accommodate population growth and settlement in new areas.\nGeography.\nAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (23.4%) is water.\nParks and preserves.\nIn addition to local parks there are several preserve areas including:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nClimate.\nSarasota County has a humid subtropical climate, bordering on a tropical savanna climate, with hot, humid summers and warm, drier winters. The high temperatures and high humidity in the summer regularly push the heat index over 100\u00a0\u00b0F (38\u00a0\u00b0C). There are distinct rainy and dry seasons, with the rainy season lasting from March to November and the dry season from December to February.\nAs is the case with all of Florida, Sarasota County is subject to Hurricanes. Notable recent storms that have brought impacts to the county include storms such as Hurricane Charley in 2004, Hurricane Irma in 2017, and Hurricane Ian in 2022. In 2024, Hurricanes Debby and Helene caused serious flooding within the county despite making landfall over 200 miles to the north, and Hurricane Milton made landfall in the county at Siesta Key on October 9, 2024 as a Category 3 Hurricane.\nGovernment and politics.\nSarasota County is one of only 20 Florida counties with its own charter, adopted in 1971. Sarasota County is governed by a five-member county commission. Each commissioner serves a four-year term and resides in and represents a single district.\nLike most of Southwest Florida, Sarasota County has been a stronghold for the Republican Party. It was one of the first parts of Florida to begin to favor the Republicans over the Democrats. The last Democratic presidential candidate to carry the county was Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1944. The closest any Democratic candidate has come since was Barack Obama in 2008, who lost in the county by just 211 votes. The Republican edge has narrowed somewhat since the 1990s, however; Democrats have managed at least 40 percent of the vote in every election since 1996. Yet the county has seen trends towards the Republican party, alongside the rest of Florida, since 2020, with Donald Trump's 2024 victory in the county being the best performance by a Republican since 1988.\nRepublicans have historically dominated the county commission and all but two countywide elected positions. Democratic strength is concentrated in Sarasota, which has an all-Democratic city commission.\nPublic safety.\nAside from the typical law enforcement and fire departments, Sarasota County also utilizes an Emergency Management agency. The agency's main area of focus is disaster preparedness and response. The agency is responsible for what are called Community Emergency Response Teams as well as the county emergency evacuation shelters.\nFire/EMS.\nThe Sarasota County Fire Department (SCFD) provides fire services to the City of Sarasota and all unincorporated areas of the county with the exception of areas covered by the Nokomis and Englewood fire districts. Additionally, SCFD provides EMS service to the City of Sarasota, all unincorporated areas of the county (including areas covered by the Nokomis and Englewood fire districts) plus the city of Venice.\nLaw enforcement.\nThe Sarasota County Sheriff's Office (SSO) is the county's primary law enforcement agency. It is responsible for patrolling the unincorporated areas of the county along with operating the county's jail and providing courtroom security. SSO also operates the county's primary 911 center. The cities of Sarasota, North Port, and Venice along with the Town of Longboat Key each have their own police departments. The Florida Highway Patrol is responsible for patrolling FDOT maintained roads in the county (Florida State Highway System) and investigating motor vehicle accidents that occur in unincorporated areas.\nThree specialist law enforcement agencies have jurisdiction in the county: the Sarasota-Bradenton International Airport Police Department, the New College/USF Sarasota-Manatee Campus Police Department, the Seminole Gulf Railway (SGLR) Police Department and the Sarasota County Schools Police Department. Each agency, except for the SCS Police Department, has jurisdiction in neighboring Manatee County as well, as each agency's properties extend into that county.\nVoter registration.\nAll voter information is since \u00a021, 2025[ [update]] and provided by Florida Department of Elections:\nGovernment officials.\nSarasota County Commission.\nThe Board of County Commissioners include the following:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSarasota County School Board.\nThe School Board members include the following:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nDemographics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"US Census population/styles.css\"/&gt;\nAs of the 2020 United States census, there were 434,006 people, 189,228 households, and 117,532 families residing in the county. 3.5% of that population was under the age of 5 years old, 14.0% was under 18 years old, and 37.4% was 65 years or older. 52.4% was female.\nThe median household income was $64,644 with a per capita income of $44,402. 8.7% of population below the poverty threshold.

{"id": "74654", "revid": "28966796", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=74654", "title": "Hoyt Wilhelm", "text": "American baseball player (1922\u20132002)\nJames Hoyt Wilhelm (July 26, 1922 \u2013 August 23, 2002), nicknamed \"Old Sarge\", was an American Major League Baseball pitcher with the New York Giants, St. Louis Cardinals, Cleveland Indians, Baltimore Orioles, Chicago White Sox, California Angels, Atlanta Braves, Chicago Cubs, and Los Angeles Dodgers between 1952 and 1972. Wilhelm was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1985.\nWilhelm grew up in North Carolina, fought in World War II, and then spent several years in the minor leagues before starting his major league career at the age of 29. He was best known for his knuckleball, which enabled him to have great longevity. He appeared occasionally as a starting pitcher, but pitched mainly as a reliever. Wilhelm won 124 games in relief, which is still the major league record as of 2025. He was the first pitcher to reach 200 saves, and the first to appear in 1,000 games.\nWilhelm was nearly 30 years old when he entered the major leagues, and pitched until he was nearly 50. He retired with one of the lowest career earned run averages, 2.52, in baseball history. After retiring as a player in 1972, Wilhelm held longtime coaching jobs with the New York Yankees and Atlanta Braves. He lived in Sarasota, Florida, for many years, and died there in 2002.\nEarly life.\nJames Hoyt Wilhelm was born on July 26, 1922, long thought to have been 1923, in Huntersville, North Carolina. He was one of eleven children born to poor tenant farmers John and Ethel (n\u00e9e Stanley) Wilhelm in Huntersville, North Carolina. He played baseball at Cornelius High School in Cornelius, North Carolina. Knowing he could not throw fast, he began experimenting with a knuckleball after reading about pitcher Dutch Leonard. He practiced honing it with a tennis ball, hoping it was his best shot at Big League success.\nProfessional career.\nWilhelm made his professional debut with the Mooresville Moors of the Class-D North Carolina State League in 1942. He served in the United States Army in the European Theater during World War II and participated in the Battle of the Bulge, where he was wounded, earning the Purple Heart for his actions. He rose to the rank of staff sergeant while in the Army, and played his entire career with a piece of shrapnel lodged in his back as a result of the wounds he received in battle. Wilhelm carried the nickname \"Old Sarge\" because of his service in the military.\nAfter his release from the military, Wilhelm returned to the Moors for the 1946 season, and earned 41 wins over the 1946 and 1947 seasons. He later recalled being dropped from a Class D minor league team and having the manager tell him to forget about the knuckleball, but he persisted with it.\nDraft and minor leagues.\nThe Boston Braves purchased Wilhelm from Mooresville in 1947, and on November 20, 1947, he was drafted by the New York Giants from the Braves in the 1947 minor league draft.\nWilhelm's first assignment in the Giants organization was in Class B with the 1948 Knoxville Smokies, for whom he registered 13 wins and 9 losses. He also spent a few games that season with the Class A Jacksonville Tars of the South Atlantic League, and returned to Jacksonville in 1949, earning a 17\u201312 win\u2013loss record and a 2.66 earned run average (ERA). Wilhelm was promoted to the Class AAA Minneapolis Millers in 1950, where he was the starting pitcher in 25 of the 35 games he pitched in, registering a 15\u201311 record with a 4.95 ERA. His role in 1951 with the Millers was the same as the year before, primarily as a starter, but also making eleven relief appearances. His ERA came down to 3.94 in 1951, but his record fell to 11\u201314.\nNew York Giants (1952\u20131956).\nThough Wilhelm was primarily a starting pitcher in the minor leagues, he had been called up to a Giants team whose strong starting pitchers had led them to a National League (NL) pennant the year before. Giants manager Leo Durocher did not think that Wilhelm's knuckleball approach would be effective for more than a few innings at a time. He assigned Wilhelm to the team's bullpen.\nWilhelm made his MLB debut with the Giants on April 18, 1952, at age 29, giving up a hit and two walks while only recording one out. On April 23, 1952, in his third game with the New York Giants, Wilhelm batted for the first time in the majors. Facing rookie Dick Hoover of the Boston Braves, Wilhelm hit a home run over the short right-field fence at the Polo Grounds. Although he went to bat a total of 432 times in his career, he never hit another home run.\nPitching exclusively in relief, Wilhelm led the NL with a 2.43 ERA in his rookie year. He won 15 games and lost three. Wilhelm finished fourth in the NL Most Valuable Player Award voting that season, behind rookie reliever Joe Black of the Dodgers. Jim Konstanty had won it for the Phillies in 1950, and Ellis Kinder had finished seventh in the AL voting in 1951, so it was a time when relief pitchers were starting to receive appreciation from the sportswriters. Wilhelm finished second in the Rookie of the Year Award voting to Joe Black. Wilhelm made 69 relief appearances in 1953, his win\u2013loss record decreased to 7\u20138 and he issued 77 walks against 71 strikeouts. Wilhelm was named to the NL All-Star team that year, but he did not play in the game because team manager Charlie Dressen did not think that any of the catchers could handle his knuckleball. The Giants renewed Wilhelm's contract in February 1954.\nIn 1954, Wilhelm was a key piece of the pitching staff that led the 1954 Giants to a world championship. He pitched 111\u00a0innings, finishing with a 12\u20134 record and a 2.10 ERA. During one of Wilhelm's appearances that season, catcher Ray Katt committed four passed balls in one inning to set the major league record; the record has subsequently been tied twice. When Stan Musial set a record by hitting five home runs in a doubleheader that year, Wilhelm was pitching in the second game and gave up two of the home runs. The 1954 World Series represented Wilhelm's only career postseason play. He pitched &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;2+1\u20443 innings over two games, earning a save in the third game. The team won the World Series in a four-game sweep.\nWilhelm's ERA increased to 3.93 over 59 games and 103 innings pitched in 1955, but he managed a 4\u20131 record. He finished the 1956 season with a 4\u20139 record and a 3.83 ERA in &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;89+1\u20443 innings. Sportswriter Bob Driscoll later attributed Wilhelm's difficulties in the mid-1950s to the decline in the career of Giants catcher Wes Westrum, writing that baseball was \"a game of inches, and for Hoyt, Wes had been that inch in the right direction.\"\nSt. Louis Cardinals (1957).\nOn February 26, 1957, Wilhelm was traded by the Giants to the St. Louis Cardinals for Whitey Lockman. At the time of the trade, St. Louis manager Fred Hutchinson described Wilhelm as the type of pitcher who \"makes us a definite pennant threat ... He'll help us where we need help the most.\" In 40 games with the Cardinals that season, he earned 11 saves but finished with a 1\u20134 record and his highest ERA to that point in his career (4.25).\nCleveland Indians (1957\u20131958).\nThe Cardinals placed him on waivers in September and he was claimed by the Cleveland Indians, who used him in two games that year.\nIn 1958, Cleveland manager Bobby Bragan used Wilhelm occasionally as a starter. Although he had a 2.49\u00a0ERA, none of the Indians' catchers could handle Wilhelm's knuckleball.\nBaltimore Orioles (1958\u20131962).\nGeneral manager Frank Lane, alarmed at the large number of passed balls, allowed the Baltimore Orioles to select Wilhelm off waivers on August 23, 1958. In Baltimore, Wilhelm lived near the home of third baseman Brooks Robinson and their families became close friends. On September 20 of that year, Wilhelm no-hit the eventual World Champion New York Yankees 1\u20130 at Memorial Stadium, in only his ninth career start. He allowed two baserunners on walks and struck out eight. The no-hitter had been threatened at one point in the ninth inning when Hank Bauer bunted along the baseline, but Robinson allowed the ball to roll and it veered foul. The no-hitter was the first in the franchise's Baltimore history; the Orioles had moved from St. Louis after the 1953 season.\nOrioles catchers had difficulty catching the Wilhelm knuckleball again in 1959 and they set an MLB record with 49 passed balls. During one April game, catcher Gus Triandos had four passed balls while catching for Wilhelm and he described the game as \"the roughest day I ever put in during my life.\" Author Bill James has written that Wilhelm and Triandos \"established the principle that a knuckleball pitcher and a big, slow catcher make an awful combination.\" Triandos once said, \"Heaven is a place where no one throws a knuckleball.\"\nDespite the passed balls, Wilhelm won the American League ERA title with a 2.19 ERA. During the 1960 season, Orioles manager Paul Richards devised a larger mitt so his catchers could handle the knuckleball. Richards was well equipped with starting pitchers during that year. By the middle of the season, he said that eight of his pitchers could serve as starters. Wilhelm started 11 of the 41 games in which he appeared. He earned an 11\u20138 record, a 3.31 ERA and seven saves. He started only one game the following year, but he was an All-Star, registered 18 saves and had a 2.30 ERA.\nIn 1962, Wilhelm had his fourth All-Star season, finishing with a 7\u201310 record, a 1.94 ERA and 15 saves.\nChicago White Sox (1963\u20131968).\nOn January 14, 1963, Wilhelm was traded by the Orioles with Ron Hansen, Dave Nicholson and Pete Ward to the Chicago White Sox for Luis Aparicio and Al Smith. Early in that season, White Sox manager Al L\u00f3pez said that Wilhelm had improved his pitching staff by 40 percent. He said that Wilhelm was \"worth more than a 20-game winner, and he works with so little effort that he probably can last as long as Satchel Paige.\" He registered 21 saves and a 2.64 ERA.\nIn 1964, Wilhelm finished with career highs in both saves (27) and games pitched (73), as the White Sox finished with a record of 98\u201364. His ERA decreased to 1.99 that season; it remained less than 2.00 through the 1968 season. In 1965, Wilhelm contributed to another passed balls record when Chicago catcher J. C. Martin allowed 33 of them in one season. That total set a modern single-season baseball record for the category. Wilhelm's career-low ERA (1.31) came in 1967, when he earned an 8\u20133 record for the White Sox with 12 saves.\nIn the 1968 season, Wilhelm was getting close to breaking the all-time games pitched record belonging to Cy Young (906 games). Chicago manager Eddie Stanky began to think about using Wilhelm as a starting pitcher for game number 907. However, the White Sox fired Stanky before the record came up. Wilhelm later broke the record as a relief pitcher. He also set MLB records for consecutive errorless games by a pitcher, career victories in relief, games finished and innings pitched in relief. Despite Wilhelm's success, the White Sox, who had won at least 83 games per season in the 1960s, performed poorly. They finished 1968 with a 67\u201395 record.\nWilhelm was noted during this period for his mentoring of relief pitcher Wilbur Wood, who came to the 1967 White Sox in a trade. Wood sometimes threw a knuckleball upon his arrival in Chicago, but Wilhelm encouraged him to throw it full-time. By 1968, Wood won 13 games, saved 16 games and earned a 1.87 ERA. He credited Wilhelm with helping him to master the knuckleball, as the White Sox coaches did not know much about how to throw it. Between 1968 and 1970, Wood pitched in more games (241) than any other pitcher and more innings\u2015&lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;400+1\u20443\u2015than any other relief pitcher.\nCalifornia Angels (1969).\nAfter the 1968 season, MLB expanded and an expansion draft was conducted in which the new teams could select certain players from the established teams. The White Sox left Wilhelm unprotected, possibly because they did not believe that teams would have interest in a much older pitcher. On October 15, 1968, Wilhelm was chosen in the expansion draft by the Kansas City Royals as the 49th pick. That offseason, he was traded by the Royals to the California Angels for Ed Kirkpatrick and Dennis Paepke.\nWilhelm pitched 44 games for the 1969 California Angels and had a 2.47 ERA, ten saves, and a 5\u20137 record.\nAtlanta Braves (1969\u20131970).\nOn September 8, 1969, Wilhelm and Bob Priddy were traded to the Atlanta Braves for Clint Compton and Mickey Rivers. He finished the 1969 season by pitching in eight games for the Braves, earning four saves and recording a 0.73 ERA over &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;12+1\u20443\u00a0innings pitched. Wilhelm then spent most of the 1970 season with the Braves, pitching in 50 games for the team and earning ten saves.\nChicago Cubs (1970).\nOn September 21, 1970, Wilhelm was selected off waivers by the Chicago Cubs, for whom he appeared in three games.\nSecond stint with Atlanta Braves (1971).\nWilhelm was traded back to the Braves for Hal Breeden on November 30, 1970. As the Cubs had acquired Wilhelm late in the season to bolster their playoff contention, the trade back to the Braves was a source of controversy. Commissioner Bowie Kuhn investigated the transaction, and in December ruled that he did not find evidence of impropriety associated with the transactions that sent Wilhelm to the Cubs and quickly back to the Braves.\nWilhelm was released by the Braves on June 29, 1971, having pitched in three games for that year's Braves.\nLos Angeles Dodgers (1971\u20131972).\nWilhelm signed with the Los Angeles Dodgers on July 10, 1971, and appeared in nine games for the Dodgers, giving up two earned runs in &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;17+2\u20443 innings. He also pitched in eight games that season for the team's Class AAA minor league affiliate, the Spokane Indians. Wilhelm started six of those games and registered a 3.89 ERA.\nWilhelm pitched in 16 games for the Dodgers in 1972, registering a 4.62 ERA over 25 innings. The Dodgers released him on July 21, 1972. He never appeared in another game.\nAt the time of his retirement, Wilhelm had pitched in a then major league record 1,070 games. He is recognized as the first pitcher to have saved 200 games in his career, and the first pitcher to appear in 1,000 games. Wilhelm is one of the oldest players to have pitched in the major leagues; his final appearance was 16 days short of his 50th birthday.\nWilhelm retired with the lowest career earned run average of any major league hurler after 1927 (Walter Johnson) who had pitched more than 2,000\u00a0innings.\nLater life.\nAfter his retirement as a player, Wilhelm managed two minor league teams in the Atlanta Braves system for single seasons. He led the 1973 Greenwood Braves of the Western Carolinas League to a 61\u201366 record, then had a 33\u201333 record with the 1975 Kingsport Braves of the Appalachian League. He also worked as a minor league pitching coach for the New York Yankees for 22 years. As a coach, Wilhelm said that he did not teach pitchers the knuckleball, believing that people had to be born with a knack for throwing it. He sometimes worked individually with major league players who wanted to improve their knuckleballs, including Joe Niekro. The Yankees gave Wilhelm permission to work with Mickey Lolich in 1979 even though Lolich pitched for the San Diego Padres.\nWilhelm was on the ballot for the Baseball Hall of Fame for eight years before he was elected. After Wilhelm failed to garner enough votes for induction in 1983, sportswriter Jim Murray criticized the voters, saying that while Wilhelm never had the look of a baseball player, he was \"the best player in history at what he does.\" He fell short by 13 votes in 1984. Wilhelm was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1985. At his induction ceremony, he said that he had achieved all three of his initial major league goals: appearing in a World Series, being named to an All-Star team, and throwing a no-hitter.\nHe and his wife Peggy lived in Sarasota, Florida. They raised three children together: Patti, Pam, and Jim. Wilhelm died of heart failure in a Sarasota nursing home in 2002.\nIn 2013, the Bob Feller Act of Valor Award honored Wilhelm as one of 37 Baseball Hall of Fame members for his service in the United States Army during World War II.\nLegacy.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n[Hoyt] had the best knuckleball you'd ever want to see. He knew where it was going when he threw it, but when he got two strikes on you, he'd break out one that even he didn't know where it was going.\n\u00a0\u2013 Brooks Robinson\nWilhelm was known as a \"relief ace\", and his teams used him in a new way that became a trend. Rather than bringing in a relief pitcher only when the starting pitcher had begun to struggle, teams increasingly called upon their relief pitchers toward the end of any close game. Wilhelm was the first relief pitcher elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame.\nHe is also remembered as one of the most successful and \"probably the most famous 'old' player in history.\" Although, due largely to his military service, Wilhelm did not debut in the major leagues until he was already 29 years old, he nonetheless managed to appear in 21\u00a0major league seasons. He earned the nickname \"Old Folks\" while he still had more than a decade left in his playing career. He was the oldest player in Major League Baseball for each of his final seven seasons.\nFormer teammate Moose Skowron commented on Wilhelm's key pitch, saying, \"Hoyt was a good guy, and he threw the best knuckleball I ever saw. You never knew what Hoyt's pitch would do. I don't think he did either.\" Baseball executive Roland Hemond agreed, saying, \"Wilhelm's knuckleball did more than anyone else's ... There was so much action on it.\"\nBefore Wilhelm, the knuckleball was primarily mixed in to older pitchers' repertoires at the end of their careers to offset their slowing fastballs and to reduce stress on their arms, thereby extending their careers. Wilhelm broke with tradition when he began throwing the pitch as a teenager and threw it nearly every pitch. \"The New York Times\" linked his knuckleball with that of modern pitcher R. A. Dickey, as Wilhelm taught pitcher Charlie Hough the knuckleball in 1971, and Hough taught it to Dickey while coaching with the Texas Rangers.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The eldest son of Valentinian I, Gratian was raised to the rank of \"Augustus\" as a child and inherited the West after his father's death in 375. He nominally shared the government with his infant half-brother Valentinian II, who was also acclaimed emperor in Pannonia on Valentinian's death. The East was ruled by his uncle Valens, who was later succeeded by Theodosius I.\nGratian subsequently led a campaign across the Rhine, attacked the Lentienses, and forced the tribe to surrender. That same year, the eastern emperor Valens was killed fighting the Goths at the Battle of Adrianople, which led to Gratian elevating Theodosius to replace him in 379. Gratian favoured Nicene Christianity over traditional Roman religion, issuing the Edict of Thessalonica, refusing the office of \"pontifex maximus\", and removing the Altar of Victory from the Roman Senate's Curia Julia. The city of Cularo on the Is\u00e8re river in Roman Gaul was renamed after him, which later evolved to Grenoble. By 383 Gratian had become unpopular with his army, which abandoned him during a confrontation with the usurper Magnus Maximus near Lutetia (Paris). Gratian fled to Lugdunum and was later murdered.\nEarly life.\nAccording to the \"Chronicle of Jerome\" and the \"Chronicon Paschale\", Valentinian's eldest son Gratian was born on 18 April 359 at Sirmium, now Sremska Mitrovica in Serbia, the capital of Pannonia Secunda, to Valentinian's first wife Marina Severa. Gratian was his parents' only son together. At the time of his birth Gratian's father was living in exile. Gratian was named after his grandfather Gratianus, who was a tribune and later \"comes\" of Britannia for Constantine the Great.\nFollowing the death of the emperor Jovian, on 26 February 364, Valentinian was proclaimed \"Augustus\" (emperor). Within a month, motivated by senior officers, he proclaimed his brother Valens, Gratian's uncle, \"Augustus\" of the Eastern empire. Gratian was appointed consul in 366 and was entitled \"nobilissimus puer\" by his father. Gratian was seven when entitled \"nobilissimus puer\", which indicated he was to be proclaimed \"Augustus\". His tutor was the rhetor Ausonius, who mentioned the relationship in his epigrams and a poem.\nReign.\nIn summer 367, Valentinian became ill at Civitas Ambianensium (Amiens), raising questions about his succession. On recovery, he presented his then eight-year-old son to his troops on 24 August, as his co-\"augustus\", passing over the customary initial step of \"caesar\".\nJunior \"augustus\".\nValentinian, concerned with Gratian's age and inexperience, stated his son would assist commanders with upcoming campaigns. The \"magister peditum\" Merobaudes, together with the \"comes\" \"rei militaris\" Sebastianus, was sent by Valentinian to campaign against the Quadi.\nWhen a party of Alamanni visited Valentinian's headquarters to receive the customary gifts towards the end of 364, Ursatius, the \"magister officiorum\" made them an offering they considered inferior to that of his predecessor. Angered by Ursatius' attitude, they vowed revenge and crossed over the Rhine into Roman Germania and Gaul in January 365, overwhelming the Roman defences. Although at first unsuccessful, eventually Jovinus, the \"magister equitum\" in Gaul inflicted heavy losses on the enemy at Scarpona (Dieulouard) and at Catalauni (Ch\u00e2lons-sur-Marne), forcing them to retire. An opportunity to further weaken the Alamanni occurred in the summer of 368, when king Vithicabius was murdered in a coup, and Valentinian and his son Gratian crossed the river Moenus (the Main) laying waste to Alamannic territories. Gratian was awarded the victory titles of \"Germanicus Maximus\" and \"Alamannicus Maximus\", and \"Francicus Maximus\" and \"Gothicus Maximus\" in 369.\nValentinian fortified the frontier from Raetia in the east to the Belgic channel, but the construction was attacked by Alamanni at Mount Pirus (the Spitzberg, Rottenburg am Neckar). In 369 (or 370) Valentinian then sought to enlist the help of the Burgundians, who were involved in a dispute with the Alamanni, but a communication failure led to them returning to their lands without joining forces with the Romans. It was then that the \"magister equitum\", Theodosius the Elder and his son Theodosius (the Theodosi) attacked the Alamanni through Raetia, taking many prisoners and resettling them in the Po Valley in Italy. Valentinian made one attempt to capture Macrianus in 372, but eventually made peace with him in 374.\nGratian, who was then 15, was married in 374 to Constantius II's 13 year-old posthumous daughter Constantia at Trier.\nThe necessity to make peace was the increasing threat from other peoples, the Quadi and the Sarmatians. Valentinian's decision to establish garrisons across the Danube had angered them, and the situation escalated after the Quadi king, Gabinus, was killed during negotiations with the Romans in 374. Consequently, in the autumn, the Quadi crossed the Danube plundering Pannonia and the provinces to the south. The situation deteriorated further once the Sarmatians made common cause inflicting heavy losses on the Pannonica and Moesiaca legions. However, on encountering Theodosius' forces on the borders of Moesia in the eastern Balkans, which had previously defeated one of their armies in 373, they sued for peace. Valentinian mounted a further offensive against the Quadi in August 375, this time using a pincer movement, one force attacking from the northwest, while Valentinian himself headed to Aquincum (Budapest), crossed the Danube and attacked from the southeast. This campaign resulted in heavy losses to the enemy, following which he returned to Aquincum and from there to Brigetio (Sz\u0151ny, Hungary) where he died suddenly in November.\nSenior \"augustus\".\nWhen his father died on 17 November 375, Gratian inherited the administration of the western empire. Days later, Gratian's half-brother Valentinian was acclaimed \"augustus\" by troops in Pannonia. He was forced to accept the proclamation, though he did supervise his younger brother's upbringing. Despite Valentinian being given nominal authority over the praetorian prefectures of Italy, Illyricum, and Africa, Gratian ruled the western Roman empire himself. His tutor Ausonius became his \"quaestor\", and together with the , Merobaudes, the power behind the throne. Neither Gratian nor Valentinian travelled much, possibly avoiding public appearances which would let the populace realise how young they were. Gratian is said to have visited Rome in 376, possibly to celebrate his on 24 August, but whether the visit actually took place is disputed.\nGratian's uncle Valens, returning from a campaign against the Sasanian Empire, had sent a request to Gratian for reinforcements against the Goths. According to Ammianus Marcellinus, Valens also requested that Sebastianus be sent to him for the war, though according to Zosimus Sebastianus went to Constantinople of his own accord as a result of intrigues by eunuchs at the western court. Once Gratian had put down the invasions in the west in early 378, he notified Valens that he was returning to Thrace to assist him in his struggle against the Goths. Late in July, Valens was informed that the Goths were advancing on Adrianople (Edirne) and Nice, and started to move his forces into the area. However, Gratian's arrival was delayed by an encounter with Alans at Castra Martis, in Dacia in the western Balkans. \nThe force Gratian sent never reached Valens due to its commander feigning illness. Weeks later, Gratian had arrived in Castra Martis with a few thousand men, by which time Valens was at Adrianople (; ). Encouraged by his advisors to claim victory without sharing the glory with Gratian, as well as being misinformed about the number of enemy troops, Valens attacked the Gothic army and as a result thousands of Romans died in the Battle of Adrianople along with Sebastianus and the emperor himself.\n In the immediate aftermath of Adrianople, Gratian issued an edict of tolerance at Sirmium, restoring bishops exiled by Valens and ensuring religious freedoms to all religions. Following the battle, the Goths raided from Thrace in 378 to Illyricum the following year. Convinced that one emperor alone was incapable of repelling the inundation of foes on several different fronts, Gratian, now senior \"augustus\" following Valens's death, appointed Theodosius I \"augustus\" on 19 January 379 to govern the east. On 3 August that year, Gratian issued an edict against heresy.\nOn 27 February 380, Gratian, Valentinian II, and Theodosius issued the Edict of Thessalonica. This edict made Nicene Christianity the only legal form of Christianity, outlawing all of its other branches, ending a period of widespread religious tolerance that had existed since the death of Julian. Zosimus' report that Gratian refused the robe of office of the \"pontifex maximus\" has been doubted by modern scholars, because there is no other mention of such a garment associated with the priesthood. Emperors from Gratian to Marcian styled themselves as \"pontifex inclytus\", \"honorable pontiff\". The title of \"pontifex maximus\" was not adopted by the bishops of Rome until the Renaissance.\nIn September 380, the \"augusti\" Gratian and Theodosius met, returning the Roman diocese of Dacia to Gratian's control and that of Macedonia to Valentinian II. The same year, Gratian won a victory, possibly over the Alamanni, that was announced officially at Constantinople.\nBy 380, the Greuthungi tribe of Goths moved into Pannonia, only to be defeated by Gratian. Consequently, the Vandals and Alemanni were threatening to cross the Rhine, now that Gratian had departed from the region. With the collapse of the Danube frontier under the incursions of the Huns and Goths, Gratian moved his seat from Augusta Treverorum (Trier) to Mediolanum (Milan) in 381. He became increasingly aligned with the city's bishop, Ambrose, and the Roman Senate, shifting the balance of power within the factions of the western empire.\nIn 382, Gratian issued edicts that removed the statue of the winged goddess Victory from the Senate floor, removed the privileges of Vestal Virgins, and confiscated money designated for sacrifices and ceremonies. He declared that all of the pagan temples and shrines were to be confiscated by the government and that their revenues were to be joined to the property of the treasury. This resulted in protests from the Roman Senate led by Symmachus, which in turn was counter-protested by Christian senators led by Pope Damasus.\nOn 16 January 383 Theodosius made his son Arcadius co-emperor, evidently without Gratian's approval as he never recognized the promotion on his coinage. Within the same year, Gratian's wife Constantia died, and he remarried to Laeta. Both marriages remained childless.\nGratian alienated the army by his favouritism towards his Alan deserters, whom he made his bodyguards and to whom he gave military commands and allowing them to perform human sacrifices to Ares. Other criticisms of his behavior were that he surrounded himself with bad company and neglected the affairs of state, preferring to have fun. Vegetius reports that Gratian allowed soldiers to lay aside the armour and the helmet. \nIn the summer of 383 Gratian was again at war with the Alamanni in Raetia. Shortly after, the Roman general Magnus Maximus had raised the standard of revolt in Britain and invaded Gaul with a large army. Maximus, who had served under the \"comes\" Theodosius and had won a victory over the Picts in 382, was proclaimed \"augustus\" and crossed the channel, encamping near Paris. There, his forces encountered Gratian, but much of the latter's army defected to the usurper, forcing Gratian to flee.\nDeath and burial.\nGratian was pursued by Andragathius, Maximus' \"magister equitum\" and killed at Lugdunum (Lyon) on 25 August 383, supposedly against orders. Maximus then established his court at the former imperial residence in Trier. On the death of Gratian, the 12 year old Valentinian II became the sole legitimate \"augustus\" in the west.\nMaximus initially kept Gratian's body for political reasons, and Ambrose's second embassy to him in 385 or 386 to recover it was unsuccessful. It would not be until 387, possibly even after the death of Magnus Maximus, that Gratian's remains were interred at Mediolanum in the imperial mausoleum. Gratian was deified in .\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "74656", "revid": "13644854", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=74656", "title": "Knesset", "text": "Unicameral legislature of Israel\nThe Knesset ( lit.\u2009'gathering, assembly', ) is the unicameral legislature of Israel.\nThe Knesset passes all laws, elects the president and prime minister, approves the cabinet, and supervises the work of the government, among other things. In addition, the Knesset elects the state comptroller. It also has the power to waive the immunity of its members, remove the president and the state comptroller from office, dissolve the government in a constructive vote of no confidence, and to dissolve itself and call new elections. The prime minister may also dissolve the Knesset. However, until an election is completed, the Knesset maintains authority in its current composition. The Knesset meets in its building in Givat Ram, Jerusalem.\nMembers of the Knesset are elected nationwide through proportional representation.\nName.\nThe term \"Knesset\" is derived from the ancient \"Knesset HaGdola\" () or \"Great Assembly\", which according to Jewish tradition was an assembly of 120 scribes, sages, and prophets, in the period from the end of the Biblical prophets to the time of the development of Rabbinic Judaism \u2013 about two centuries ending c. 200 BCE. There is, however, no organisational continuity and aside from the number of members, there is little similarity, as the ancient Knesset was a religious, completely unelected body. Members of the Knesset are known in Hebrew as \u05d7\u05b2\u05d1\u05b5\u05e8 \u05d4\u05b7\u05db\u05b0\u05bc\u05e0\u05b6\u05e1\u05b6\u05ea (\"\u1e24aver HaKnesset\"), if male, or \u05d7\u05b7\u05d1\u05b0\u05e8\u05b7\u05ea \u05d4\u05b7\u05db\u05b0\u05bc\u05e0\u05b6\u05e1\u05b6\u05ea (\"\u1e24avrat HaKnesset\"), if female.\nHistory.\nThe Knesset first convened on 14 February 1949 in Jerusalem following the 20 January elections, replacing the Provisional State Council which acted as Israel's official legislature from its date of independence on 14 May 1948 and succeeding the Assembly of Representatives that had functioned as the Jewish community's representative body during the Mandate era. Before the construction of its current location, the Knesset met in Tel Aviv, before moving to the Froumine building in Jerusalem.\nThe Knesset building sits on a hilltop in western Jerusalem in a district known as Sheikh Badr before the 1948 Arab\u2013Israeli War, now Givat Ram. The main building was financed by James de Rothschild as a gift to the State of Israel in his will and was completed in 1966. It was built on land leased from the Greek Orthodox Patriarchate of Jerusalem, later purchased in the 1990s. Over the years, significant additions to the structure were constructed, however, these were built at levels below and behind the main 1966 structure as not to detract from the original assembly building's appearance.\nDespite numerous motions of no confidence being tabled in the Knesset, a government has only been defeated by one once, when Yitzhak Shamir's government was brought down on 15 March 1990 as part of a plot that became known as \"the dirty trick\".\nHowever, several governments have resigned as a result of no-confidence motions, even when they were not defeated. These include the fifth government, which fell after Prime Minister Moshe Sharett resigned in June 1955 following the abstention of the General Zionists (part of the governing coalition) during a vote of no-confidence; the ninth government, which fell after Prime Minister Ben-Gurion resigned in January 1961 over a motion of no-confidence on the Lavon Affair; and the seventeenth government, which resigned in December 1976 after the National Religious Party (part of the governing coalition) abstained in a motion of no-confidence against the government.\nGovernment duties.\nAs the legislative branch of the Israeli government, the Knesset passes all laws, elects the president, approves the cabinet, and supervises the work of the government through its committees. It also has the power to waive the immunity of its members, remove the president and the State Comptroller from office, and to dissolve itself and call new elections.\nThe Knesset has \"de jure\" parliamentary supremacy, and can pass any law by a simple majority, even one that might arguably conflict with the Basic Laws of Israel, unless the basic law includes specific conditions for its modification; in accordance with a plan adopted in 1950, the Basic Laws can be adopted and amended by the Knesset, acting in its capacity as a Constituent Assembly. The Knesset itself is regulated by a Basic Law called \"Basic Law: the Knesset\".\nIn addition to the absence of a formal constitution, and with no Basic Law thus far being adopted which formally grants a power of judicial review to the judiciary, the Supreme Court of Israel has since the early 1990s asserted its authority, when sitting as the High Court of Justice, to invalidate provisions of Knesset laws it has found to be inconsistent with Basic Law. The Knesset is presided over by a Speaker and Deputy Speakers, called the Knesset Presidium, which currently consists of:\nKnesset committees.\nKnesset committees amend bills on various appropriate subjects. \nKnesset members are assigned to\ncommittees, while chairpersons are chosen by their members, on recommendation of the House Committee, and their factional composition represents that of the Knesset itself. Committees may elect sub-committees and delegate powers to them, or establish joint committees for issues concerning more than one committee. To further their deliberations, they invite non-voting people, like government ministers, senior officials, and experts in the matter being discussed. Committees may request explanations and information from any relevant ministers in any matter within their competence, and the ministers or persons appointed by them must provide the explanation or information requested.\nThere are four types of committees in the Knesset. Permanent committees amend proposed legislation dealing with their area of expertise, and may initiate legislation. However, such legislation may only deal with Basic Laws and laws dealing with the Knesset, elections to the Knesset, Knesset members, or the State Comptroller. Special committees function in a similar manner to permanent committees, but are appointed to deal with particular manners at hand, and can be dissolved or turned into permanent committees. Parliamentary inquiry committees are appointed by the plenum to deal with issues viewed as having special national importance. In addition, there are two types of committees that convene only when needed: the Interpretations Committee, made up of the Speaker and eight members chosen by the House Committee, deals with appeals against the interpretation given by the Speaker during a sitting of the plenum to the Knesset rules of procedure or precedents, and Public Committees, established to deal with issues that are connected to the Knesset.\nPermanent committees:\nSpecial committees:\nThe other committees are the Arrangements Committee and the Ethics Committee. The Ethics Committee is responsible for jurisdiction over Knesset members who violate the rules of ethics of the Knesset, or are involved in illegal activities outside the Knesset. Within the framework of responsibility, the Ethics Committee may place various sanctions on a member, but is not allowed to restrict a member's right to vote. The Arrangements Committee proposes the makeup of the permanent committees following each election, as well as suggesting committee chairs, lays down the sitting arrangements of political parties in the Knesset, and the distribution of offices in the Knesset building to members and parties.\nCaucuses.\nKnesset members often join in formal or informal groups known as \"lobbies\" or \"caucuses\", to advocate for a particular topic. There are hundreds of such caucuses in the Knesset. The Knesset Christian Allies Caucus and the Knesset Land of Israel Caucus are two of the largest and most active caucuses.\nMembership.\nThe Knesset numbers 120 members, after the size of the Great Assembly. The subject of Knesset membership has often been a cause for proposed reforms. Under the Norwegian Law, Knesset members who are appointed to ministerial positions are allowed to resign and allow the next person on their party's list to take their seat. If they leave the cabinet, they are able to return to the Knesset to take the place of their replacement.\nKnesset elections.\nThe 120 members of the Knesset (MKs) are popularly elected from a single nationwide electoral district to concurrent four-year terms, subject to calls for early elections (which are quite common). All Israeli citizens 18 years or older may vote in legislative elections, which are conducted by secret ballot.\nKnesset seats are allocated among the various parties using the D'Hondt method of party list proportional representation. A party or electoral alliance must pass an election threshold of 3.25% of the overall vote to be allocated a Knesset seat (in 2022, one seat for every 152,000 votes). Parties select their candidates using a closed list. Thus, voters select the party of their choice, not any specific candidate.\nThe electoral threshold was previously set at 1% from 1949 to 1992, then 1.5% from 1992 to 2003, and then 2% until March 2014 when the current threshold of 3.25% was passed (effective with elections for the 20th Knesset). As a result of the low threshold, a typical Knesset has 10 or more factions represented. No party or faction has ever won the 61 seats necessary for a majority; the closest being the 56 seats won by the Alignment in the 1969 elections (the Alignment had briefly held 63 seats going into the 1969 elections after being formed shortly beforehand by the merger of several parties, the only occasion on which any party or faction has ever held a majority). As a result, while there have never been more than three numerically major parties at any time and only four parties (or their antecedents) have ever led governments, all Israeli governments have been coalitions.\nAfter an election, the president meets with the leaders of every party that won Knesset seats and asks them to recommend which party leader should form the government. The president then nominates the party leader who is most likely to command the support of a majority in the Knesset (though not necessarily the leader of the largest party/faction in the chamber). The prime minister-designate has 42 days to put together a viable government (extensions can be granted and often are), and then must win a vote of confidence in the Knesset before taking office.\nThe following is a list of Knesset elections:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nCurrent composition.\nThe table below lists the parliamentary factions represented in the 25th Knesset.\nKnesset assemblies.\nEach Knesset session is known by its election number. Thus the Knesset elected by Israel's first election in 1949 is known as the \"First Knesset\". The current Knesset, elected in 2022, is the Twenty-fifth Knesset.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nTourism.\nThe Knesset holds morning tours in Hebrew, Arabic, English, French, Spanish, German, and Russian on Sunday and Thursday, and there are also live session viewing times on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday mornings.\nSecurity.\nThe Knesset is protected by the Knesset Guard, a protective security unit responsible for the security of the Knesset building and Knesset members. Guards are stationed outside the building to provide armed protection, and ushers are stationed inside to maintain order. The Knesset Guard also plays a ceremonial role, participating in state ceremonies, which includes greeting dignitaries on Mount Herzl on the eve of Israeli Independence Day.\nPublic perception.\nA poll conducted by the Israeli Democracy Institute in April and May 2014 showed that while a majority of both Jews and Arabs in Israel are proud to be citizens of the country, both groups share a distrust of Israel's government, including the Knesset. Almost three quarters of Israelis surveyed said corruption in Israel's political leadership was either \"widespread or somewhat prevalent\". A majority of both Arabs and Jews trusted the Israel Defense Forces, the President of Israel, and the Supreme Court of Israel, but Jews and Arabs reported similar levels of mistrust, with little more than a third of each group claiming confidence in the Knesset.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He ruled the Western half of the empire, while his brother Valens ruled the East. During his reign, he fought successfully against the Alamanni, Quadi, and Sarmatians, strengthening the border fortifications and conducting campaigns across the Rhine and Danube. Also, his general Theodosius the Elder defeated a revolt in Africa and the Great Conspiracy (a coordinated assault on Roman Britain by Picts, Scoti, and Saxons). Valentinian founded the Valentinian dynasty, with his sons Gratian and Valentinian II succeeding him in the western half of the empire and his daughter Galla marrying emperor Theodosius I.\nEarly life.\nValentinian was born in 321 at Cibalae (now Vinkovci, Croatia) in southern Pannonia into a family of Illyro-Roman origin. Valentinian and his younger brother Valens were the sons of Gratianus (nicknamed Funarius), a military officer renowned for his wrestling skills.\nGratianus was promoted to \"comes Africae\" in the late 320s or early 330s, and the young Valentinian accompanied his father to Africa. However, Gratianus was soon accused of embezzlement and retired. Valentinian joined the army in the late 330s and later probably acquired the position of \"protector domesticus\". Gratianus was later recalled during the early 340s and was made \"comes Britanniarum\". After holding this post, he retired to the family estate in Cibalae.\nIn 350, Constans I was assassinated by agents of the usurper Magnentius, a commander who proclaimed himself emperor in Gaul. Constantius II, older brother of Constans and emperor in the East, promptly set forth towards Magnentius with a large army. The following year the two emperors met in Pannonia and fought the Battle of Mursa Major, which ended in a costly victory for Constantius. Two years later Magnentius killed himself after another defeat at the Battle of Mons Seleucus, leaving Constantius sole ruler of the empire. It was around this time that Constantius confiscated Gratianus' property, for supposedly showing hospitality to Magnentius when he was in Pannonia. Despite his father's fall from favour, Valentinian does not seem to have been adversely affected at this time, making it unlikely he ever fought for the usurper. It is known that Valentinian was in the region during the conflict, but what involvement he had in the war, if any, is unknown.\nService under Constantius and Julian.\nDuring the conflict between Magnentius and Constantius, the Alamanni and Franks took advantage of the confusion and crossed the Rhine, attacking several important settlements and fortifications. In 355, after deposing his cousin Gallus but still feeling the crises of the empire too much for one emperor to handle, Constantius raised his cousin Julian to the rank of \"Caesar\". With the situation in Gaul rapidly deteriorating, Julian was made at least nominal commander of one of the two main armies in Gaul, Barbatio being commander of the other. Constantius devised a strategy where Julian and Barbatio would operate in a pincer movement against the Alamanni. However, a band of Alamanni slipped past Julian and Barbatio and attacked Lugdunum (Lyon). Julian sent the tribunes Valentinian and Bainobaudes to watch the road the raiders would have to return by. However, their efforts were hindered by Barbatio and his tribune Cella. The Alamanni king Chnodomarius took advantage of the situation and attacked the Romans, inflicting heavy losses. Barbatio complained to Constantius and the debacle was blamed on Valentinian and Bainobaudes, who were cashiered from the army.\nWith his career in ruins, Valentinian returned to his new family estate in Sirmium (in modern day Serbia). Two years later his first wife Marina Severa had given birth to a son, Gratian. During the (sole) reign of the polytheist Julian, Valentinian's actions and location become uncertain, but he was likely exiled, or perhaps simply sent to command a remote outpost. The sources give contradictory accounts of what happened, with some versions saying that he refused to make pagan sacrifices and voluntarily chose to leave, and others saying he was merely dismissed for his Christianity.\nRise to power.\nAt the news of Julian's death on a campaign against the Sasanian Empire, the army hastily declared Jovian the new emperor. Jovian extricated his soldiers from Persian territory by agreeing to a humiliating peace treaty, then started back to Constantinople. During Jovian's brief reign Valentinian was promoted to tribune of a \"Scutarii\" (elite infantry) regiment, which Hughes considered to reflect the new emperor\u2019s trust in him, and dispatched to Ancyra (modern day Ankara).\nJovian died in mysterious circumstances before he reached the capital, and a meeting of civil and military officials was convened at Nicaea to choose a new emperor. Salutius, who had already refused the throne after Julian's death, now did so again, first for himself and then on behalf of his son. Two other names were proposed: Aequitius, a tribune of the first Scutarii, and Januarius, a relative of Jovian's in charge of military supplies in Illyricum. Both were rejected; Aequitius as too rough and boorish, Januarius because he was too far away. As a man well qualified and at hand nearby, the assembly finally agreed upon Valentinian and sent messengers to inform him in Ancyra.\nReign.\nValentinian accepted the acclamation on 25 or 26 February 364. As he prepared to make his accession speech, the soldiers threatened to riot, apparently uncertain of his loyalties. Valentinian reassured them that the army was his greatest priority. According to Ammianus the soldiers were astounded by Valentinian's bold demeanour and his willingness to assume the imperial authority. To further prevent a succession crisis he agreed to pick a co-\"Augustus\", perhaps as a reassurance to civilian officials in the Eastern part of the Empire that someone with imperial authority would be present to protect their interests.\nValentinian selected his brother Valens as co-\"Augustus\" at Constantinople on 28 March 364. This was done over the objections of Dagalaifus, the \"magister equitum\". Ammianus makes it clear that Valens was subordinate to his brother. The remainder of 364 was spent delegating administrative duties and military commands. According to the 5th century pagan historian Zosimus, who was inclined to revile the restorer of Christianity, all the ministers and officials appointed by Julian were summarily dismissed in disgrace. This assertion was qualified by modern authorities. It is certain that some reshuffling of commands occurred along with the division of the provinces, but the changes were strictly based on merit. The Sophists and philosophers who had proliferated in the court of Julian, drawing large salaries for delusive services, were cashiered. Valentinian retained the services of Dagalaifus and promoted Aequitius to \"Comes Illyricum\". Valens was given the Praetorian prefecture of the East, governed by prefect Salutius. Valentinian gained control of Italy, Gaul, and Illyricum. Valens resided in Constantinople, while Valentinian's court was situated in Milan (Mediolanum).\nCampaigns in Gaul and Germania.\nIn 365 the Alemanni crossed the Rhine and invaded Gaul. Simultaneously, Procopius began his revolt against Valens in the east. According to Ammianus, Valentinian received news of both crises on 1 November while on his way to Lutetia. He initially sent Dagalaifus to fight the Alemanni while he himself made preparations to march east and help Valens. After receiving counsel from his court and deputations from the leading Gallic cities begging him to stay and protect Gaul, he decided to remain and fight the Alemanni.\nValentinian advanced to Durocortorum and sent two generals, Charietto and Severianus, against the invaders. Both generals were promptly defeated and killed; Dagalaifus took their place in 366, but he was also ineffective. Late in the campaigning season Dagalaifus was replaced by Jovinus, a general from the court of Valentinian. After several victories along the Meuse river, Jovinus fought and won a pitched battle with the Alemanni near Chal\u00f4n. After his victory he pushed the Alemanni out of Gaul and was awarded the consulate the following year for his efforts.\nIn early 367, crises in Britain and northern Gaul postponed Valentinian's punitive expedition against the Alemanni, who promptly re-crossed the Rhine and plundered Moguntiacum. Valentinian succeeded in arranging the assassination of Vithicabius, an Alemannic leader, but wanted to decisively end the conflict by bringing the Alemanni under Roman hegemony. Valentinian spent the entire winter of 367 gathering a massive army for a spring offensive. He summoned the \"Comes Italiae\" Sebastianus, with the Italian and Illyrian legions, to join Jovinus and Severus, the \"magister peditum\". In the spring of 368 Valentinian, his eight-year-old son Gratian and the army crossed the Rhine and Main rivers into Alemannic territory. Initially they encountered no resistance, burning any dwellings or food stores they found along the way. Finally, Valentinian fought the Alemanni in the Battle of Solicinium; the Romans were victorious but suffered heavy casualties. A temporary peace was reached and Valentinian returned to Trier for the winter. During 369, Valentinian ordered new defensive works to be constructed and old structures refurbished along the length of the Rhine's west bank. Boldly, he ordered the construction of a fortress across the Rhine in the mountains near modern Heidelberg. The Alemanni sent envoys to protest, but they were dismissed. The Alemanni attacked the fortress while it was still under construction and destroyed it.\nIn 370 the Saxons renewed their attacks on northern Gaul. Nannienus, the \"comes\" in charge of the troops in northern Gaul, urged Severus to come to his aid. After several modest successes, a truce was called and the Saxons handed over young men fit for duty in the Roman military, in exchange for free passage back to their homeland. The Romans ambushed them and destroyed the entire invading force.\nValentinian meanwhile tried to persuade the Burgundians \u2013 bitter enemies of the Alemanni \u2013 to attack Macrian, a powerful Alemannic chieftain. If the Alamanni tried to flee, Valentinian would be waiting for them with his army. Negotiations with the Burgundians broke down when Valentinian, in his usual high-handed manner, refused to meet with the Burgundian envoys and personally assure them of Roman support. Nevertheless, rumors of a Roman alliance with the Burgundians did have the effect of scattering the Alemanni through fear of an imminent attack from their enemies. This event allowed the \"magister equitum\" Theodosius to attack the Alemanni through Raetia. The many prisoners he took were settled in the Po river valley in Italy, where they still resided at the time Ammianus wrote his history.\nValentinian campaigned unsuccessfully for four more years to defeat Macrian, who in 372 barely escaped capture by Theodosius. Meanwhile, Valentinian continued to recruit heavily from Alemanni friendly to Rome. The Alemannic king Fraomar was given the rank of tribune and sent to Britain in 372\u2013373 with an army of reinforcements, and the noblemen Bitheridius and Hortarius became commanders in Valentinian's army, although Hortarius was soon executed for conspiring with Macrian. The campaigns against hostile Alemanni were hampered by troubles first in Africa, and later on the Danube river. In 374 Valentinian was forced to make peace with Macrian because the Emperor's presence was needed to counter an invasion of Illyricum by the Quadi and Sarmatians.\nThe Great Conspiracy.\nIn 367, events known as the Great Conspiracy threatened Roman control of Britain. Valentinian received reports that a combined force of Picts, Attacotti and Scots had attacked the province, killing the \"Comes litoris Saxonici\" Nectaridus and \"Dux Britanniarum\" Fullofaudes. At the same time, Frankish and Saxon forces were raiding the coastal areas of northern Gaul. Valentinian set out for Britain, sending \"Comes domesticorum\" Severus ahead of him to investigate. Severus was not able to correct the situation and returned to Gaul, meeting Valentinian at Samarobriva. Valentinian then sent Jovinus to Britain and promoted Severus to \"magister peditum\". It was at this time that Valentinian fell ill and a battle for succession broke out between Severus, a representative of the army, and Rusticus Julianus, \"magister memoriae\" and a representative of the Gallic nobility. The conflict dissipated when Valentinian recovered and appointed his son Gratian as his co-Augustus in the west. Ammianus remarks that such an action was unprecedented. Jovinus quickly returned saying that he needed more men to take care of the situation. In 368 Valentinian appointed Theodosius as the new \"Comes Britanniarum\" with instructions to return Britain to Roman rule. Meanwhile, Severus and Jovinus were to accompany the emperor on his campaign against the Alamanni.\nTheodosius arrived in 368 with the Batavi, Heruli, Jovii and Victores legions. Landing at Rutupi\u00e6, he proceeded to Londinium, restoring order to southern Britain. Later, he rallied the remaining garrison which was originally stationed in Britain; it was apparent the units had lost their cohesiveness when Fullofaudes and Nectaridus had been defeated. Theodosius sent for Civilis to be installed as the new vicarius of the diocese and Dulcitius as an additional general.\nIn 369, Theodosius set about reconquering the areas north of Londinium, putting down the revolt of Valentinus, the brother-in-law of a vicarius, Maximinus. Subsequently, Theodosius restored the rest of Britain to the empire and rebuilt many fortifications \u2013 renaming northern Britain 'Valentia'. After his return in 369, Valentinian promoted Theodosius to \"magister equitum\" in place of Jovinus.\nRevolt in Africa and crises on the Danube.\nIn 372, the rebellion of Firmus broke out in the still-devastated African provinces. This rebellion was driven by the corruption of the \"comes\" Romanus. Romanus took sides in the murderous disputes among the legitimate and illegitimate children of Nubel, a Moorish prince and leading Roman client in Africa. Resentment of Romanus's personal use of public funds and his failure to defend the province from desert nomads caused some of the provincials to revolt. Valentinian sent in Theodosius to restore imperial control. Over the following two years Theodosius uncovered Romanus' crimes, arrested him and his supporters, and defeated both Firmus and the African tribes like the Abanni and Caprarienses that supported him.\nIn 373, hostilities erupted with the Quadi, a group of Germanic-speaking people living on the upper Danube. Like the Alamanni, the Quadi were outraged that Valentinian was building fortifications in their territory. They complained and sent deputations to the \"magister armorum per Illyricum\" Aequitius, who promised to refer the matter to Valentinian. However, the increasingly influential minister Maximinus, now praetorian prefect of Gaul, blamed Aequitius to Valentinian for the trouble, and managed to have him promote his son Marcellianus to finish the project. The protests of Quadic leaders continued to delay the project, and to put an end to their clamor Marcellianus murdered the Quadic king Gabinius at a banquet ostensibly arranged for peaceful negotiations. This roused the Quadi to war, along with their allies the Sarmatians. During the fall, they crossed the Danube and began ravaging the province of Pannonia Valeria. The marauders could not penetrate the fortified cities, but they heavily damaged the unprotected countryside. Two legions were sent in but failed to coordinate and were routed by the Sarmatians. Meanwhile, another group of Sarmatians invaded Moesia, but were driven back by the son of Theodosius, \"Dux Moesiae\" and later emperor Theodosius.\nValentinian did not receive news of these crises until late 374. The following spring he set out from Trier and arrived at Carnuntum, which was deserted. There he was met by Sarmatian envoys who begged forgiveness for their actions. Valentinian replied that he would investigate what had happened and act accordingly. Valentinian ignored Marcellianus\u2019 treacherous actions and decided to punish the Quadi. He was accompanied by Sebastianus and Merobaudes, and spent the summer months preparing for the campaign. In the fall he crossed the Danube at Aquincum into Quadi territory. After pillaging Quadi lands without opposition, he retired to Savaria to winter quarters.\nDeath.\nWithout waiting for the spring, Valentinian decided to continue campaigning and moved from Savaria to Brigetio. He arrived on 17 November 375 and had a hostile meeting with a Quadi deputation, who received permission for their people to leave in peace in return for supplying fresh recruits to the Roman army. The envoys insisted that the conflict was caused by the building of Roman forts in their lands. They added that individual bands of Quadi, not affiliated with the chiefs who had made the treaties, might still attack the Romans at any time. Enraged, Valentinian began yelling abuse at the envoys and suffered a fatal stroke. As was the custom, he was deified, becoming known as .\nReputation.\nModern historian A.H.M. Jones writes that although Valentinian I was \"less of a boor\" than his chief rival for election to the imperial throne, \"he was of a violent and brutal temper, and not only uncultivated himself, but hostile to cultivated persons\". According to Ammianus, \"he hated the well-dressed and educated and wealthy and well-born\", which suggests Valentinian had his enemies in Rome who wanted to defame him by describing him as an uneducated brute. This was not a complete picture: Ammianus concedes that Valentinian had some spontaneous oratorical skill, and also says that in his spare time the Emperor was \"an elegant painter and modeller [i.e., sculptor], and an inventor of new kinds of [weapons]\" (XXX.9.4). He appointed the Latin scholar Ausonius as tutor for his son Gratian, showing an appreciation for the kind of classical education which he himself had been denied. According to Hugh Chisholm (1911), he was an able soldier and a conscientious administrator who took an interest in the welfare of the humbler classes, from which his father had risen. He founded schools, and provided medical attendance for the poor of Rome by appointing a physician for each of the fourteen districts of the city. He also reissued an edict of Constantine I condemning abandonment of infants.\nUnfortunately Valentinian's good intentions were often frustrated by a bad choice of ministers, and \"an obstinate belief in their merits despite all evidence to the contrary.\" Further, the benevolence of his more generous edicts was counterbalanced by remarkable cruelty and barbarism in his private affairs.\nHe often had servants and attendants executed on trifling charges, and was reportedly accustomed to feed his victims to two bears, known as \"Mica Aurea\" (golden flake), and \"Innocence\", whose iron cage was transported wherever the emperor went. At length \"Innocence\", when she was considered to have faithfully discharged her office, was released with Valentinian's good wishes into her native wilds.\nValentinian was a Christian but permitted liberal religious freedom to all his subjects, proscribing only some forms of rituals such as particular types of sacrifices, and banning the practice of magic. In Christian affairs, he released edicts against the increasing wealth and worldliness of the clergy. One new law, issued via Pope Damasus I, prohibited the granting of bequests to clergymen, and another said that members of the sacerdotal order must discharge the public duties owed on account of their property, or else relinquish it.\nAn account by Socrates Scholasticus, in his \"Historia Ecclesiastica\", has led some to describe Valentinian as polygamous. The text says that, having heard his wife Marina Severa constantly praise the beauty of her friend Justina,\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;[t]he emperor, treasuring this description by his wife in his own mind, considered with himself how he could espouse Justina, without repudiating Severa, as she had borne him Gratian, whom he had created Augustus a little while before. He accordingly framed a law, and caused it to be published throughout all the cities, by which any man was permitted to have two lawful wives. The law was promulgated and he married Justina, by whom he had Valentinian the younger.\u2014\u200a\nThis story is known only from Socrates, and there is no trace of any edict by any emperor allowing polygamy. Valentinian I and Severa may have divorced, a course permitted by Roman law (see marriage in ancient Rome). However, since divorce was not acknowledged by Christians, Socrates contemptuously describes him as a bigamist. It is also possible that Socrates attempted to accuse Justina, who was an Arian, of fornication, a common aspersion against other cults. According to John Malalas, the Chronicon Paschale, and John of Nikiu, the empress Severa was banished by Valentinian I for conducting an illegal transaction, before he consorted with Justina. Barnes believes this story to be an attempt to justify the divorce of Valentinian I without accusing the Emperor.\nThe historian Michael Grant, while noting Valentinian's unpleasant personality and bad choice of subordinates, nevertheless calls him \"the last really impressive Emperor Rome ever had\", and summarizes his career thus:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Valentinian was a superb soldier and a conscientious worker, endowed with ferocious energy. He felt a strong duty to the state, and, much more unusual, a strong duty to the poor, an emotion which he combined with a considerable distaste for the Roman upper class. More unusual still, in the age in which he lived, he believed in tolerating differences of religious opinion. For all his faults he would have been an outstanding man in any epoch, and it is only because of the misleading tradition which dismisses the personalities of the later Empire that most people have never heard of him.\nAppearance.\nThe coin portraits of Valentinian and Valens are of dubious quality, showing \"heavy\" faces rendered with \"no animation, and little consistency\". A more flattering physical description of Valentinian is given by Ammianus (XXX.9.6), who praises the emperor's \"strong and muscular body, his brilliant complexion, his grey eyes, with a gaze that was always sidelong and stern, his fine stature, and his regular features\".\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He won the Hugo Award for Best Fan Writer in 1979 and 1980. His short story \"Light of Other Days\" was a Hugo Award nominee in 1967, as was his novel \"The Ragged Astronauts\" in 1987.\nLife.\nShaw was born and raised in Belfast, the eldest of three sons of a policeman. He learned of science fiction at about 11 years old when he read an A. E. van Vogt short story in an early edition of \"Astounding Science-Fiction\" magazine. During the Second World War, American troops passed through Northern Ireland and often left their used SF magazines behind at Smithfield Market, where they were available for locals. He later described the experience as being more significant and long-lasting than taking LSD. He attended Belfast College of Technology. In 1950 he joined the group Irish Fandom, which also included another Northern Irish science fiction writer James White, and met at the house of Walt Willis on Upper Newtownards Road, Belfast. The group was influential in the early history of science fiction fandom and produced fanzines \"Hyphen\" and \"Slant\"; Shaw contributed material to both. Shaw acquired the nickname \"BoSh\" during this period. His first professional science fiction short story was published in 1954, followed by several others.\nHe gave up writing and went with his first wife Sadie (n\u00e9e Sarah Gourley) and their son and two daughters to live in Canada from 1956 to 1958. His novel \"Vertigo\" is set in Alberta, and \"Orbitsville\"'s limitless grasslands may have been influenced by this period in his life. Originally trained as a structural engineer, he worked as an aircraft designer for Short and Harland, then as science correspondent to \"The Belfast Telegraph\" from 1966 to 1969, and as publicity officer for Vickers Shipbuilding (1973\u20131975), before starting to write full-time. In April 1973, during the Troubles, Shaw and his family moved from Northern Ireland to England, where he produced most of his published work: first to Ulverston, then to Grappenhall in Warrington. After Sadie died suddenly in 1991, Shaw lived alone there for some years.\nShaw nearly lost his eyesight through illness, and suffered migraine-induced visual disturbances throughout his life. Speculative treatments of seeing, and references to eyes and vision, appear in some of his works. He was known as a drinker, and at one stage considered himself an alcoholic. He was quoted in 1991 as saying: \"I write science fiction for people who don't read a great deal of science fiction.\" He married American Nancy Tucker in 1995 and went to the US to live with her, then returned to England in the last months of his life. Shaw died of cancer on 11 February 1996.\nWorks.\nShaw is the author of \"Pilot Plant\" (May 1966) which first appeared in \"New Worlds\" (May 1966) and \"Light of Other Days\" (August 1966), the story that introduced the concept of slow glass, through which the past can be seen. Shaw sold this story to \"Analog\" editor John W. Campbell, who liked it so much Shaw wrote a sequel for him, \"Burden of Proof\", in May 1967. The original story was written in four hours, but after years of planning. Shaw expanded on the concept in the novel \"Other Days, Other Eyes\", and the concept was adopted by the Marvel Comics/Curtis Magazines anthology magazine \"Unknown Worlds of Science Fiction\".\nHis work ranged from essentially mimetic stories with fantastic elements far in the background (\"Ground Zero Man\") to van Vogtian extravaganzas (\"The Palace of Eternity\"). \"Orbitsville\" and its two sequels deal with the discovery of a habitable shell completely surrounding a star, and the consequences for humanity. \"Orbitsville\" won the 1976 British SF Association Award. Later in his career he wrote the Land and Overland trilogy (\"The Ragged Astronauts\", \"The Wooden Spaceships\" and \"The Fugitive Worlds\"), set on a system of worlds where technology has evolved with no metals. Like Philip K. Dick, he explored the nature of perception in his fiction.\nShaw was known in the fan community for his wit. Following his early membership of Irish Fandom, with Walt Willis, and James White, he always remained a keen reader of and contributor to fanzines. At the British science fiction convention Eastercon, he delivered a humorous speech (often part of his famous series known by the tongue-in-cheek label of \"Serious Scientific Talks\") for many years; these were eventually collected in \"The Eastercon Speeches\" (1979) and \"A Load of Old Bosh\" (1995), which included a similar talk at the 1979 Worldcon in Brighton, 37th World Science Fiction Convention. For these he won the 1979 and 1980 Hugo Award for Best Fan Writer. He wrote \"The Enchanted Duplicator\" with Walt Willis in 1954, a piece of fiction about science fiction fandom modelled on John Bunyan's \"The Pilgrim's Progress\".\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "74661", "revid": "13286072", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=74661", "title": "Veto", "text": "Legal power to stop an official action, usually enactment of legislation\nA veto is a legal power to unilaterally stop an official action. In the most typical case, a president or monarch vetoes a bill to stop it from becoming law. In many countries, veto powers are established in the country's constitution. Veto powers are also found at other levels of government, such as in state, provincial or local government, and in international bodies.\nSome vetoes can be overcome, often by a supermajority vote: in the United States, a two-thirds vote of the House and Senate can override a presidential veto. Some vetoes, however, are absolute and cannot be overridden. For example, in the United Nations Security Council, the five permanent members (China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States) have an absolute veto over any Security Council resolution.\nIn many cases, the veto power can only be used to prevent changes to the status quo. But some veto powers also include the ability to make or propose changes. For example, the Indian president can use an amendatory veto to propose amendments to vetoed bills.\nThe executive power to veto legislation is one of the main tools that the executive has in the legislative process, along with the proposal power. It is most commonly found in presidential and semi-presidential systems. In parliamentary systems, the head of state often has either a weak veto power or none at all. But while some political systems do not contain a formal veto power, all political systems contain veto players, people or groups who can use social and political power to prevent policy change.\nThe word \"veto\" comes from the Latin for \"I forbid\". The concept of a veto originated with the Roman offices of consul and tribune of the plebs. There were two consuls every year; either consul could block military or civil action by the other. The tribunes had the power to unilaterally block any action by a Roman magistrate or the decrees passed by the Roman Senate.\nHistory.\nRoman veto.\nThe institution of the veto, known to the Romans as the \"intercessio\", was adopted by the Roman Republic in the 6th century BC to enable the tribunes to protect the mandamus interests of the plebeians (common citizenry) from the encroachments of the patricians, who dominated the Senate. A tribune's veto did not prevent the senate from passing a bill but meant that it was denied the force of law. The tribunes could also use the veto to prevent a bill from being brought before the plebeian assembly. The consuls also had the power of veto, as decision-making generally required the assent of both consuls. If they disagreed, either could invoke the \"intercessio\" to block the action of the other. The veto was an essential component of the Roman conception of power being wielded not only to manage state affairs but to moderate and restrict the power of the state's high officials and institutions. \nA notable use of the Roman veto occurred in the Gracchan land reform, which was initially spearheaded by the tribune Tiberius Gracchus in 133 BC. When Gracchus' fellow tribune Marcus Octavius vetoed the reform, the Assembly voted to remove him on the theory that a tribune must represent the interests of the plebeians. Later, senators outraged by the reform murdered Gracchus and several supporters, setting off a period of internal political violence in Rome.\nLiberum veto.\nIn the constitution of the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth in the 17th and 18th centuries, all bills had to pass the \"Sejm\" or \"Seimas\" (parliament) by unanimous consent, and if any legislator invoked the \"liberum veto\", this not only vetoed that bill but also all previous legislation passed during the session, and dissolved the legislative session itself. The concept originated in the idea of \"Polish democracy\" as any Pole of noble extraction was considered as good as any other, no matter how low or high his material condition might be. The more and more frequent use of this veto power paralyzed the power of the legislature and, combined with a string of weak figurehead kings, led ultimately to the partitioning and the dissolution of the Polish state in the late 18th century.\nEmergence of modern vetoes.\nThe modern executive veto derives from the European institution of royal assent, in which the monarch's consent was required for bills to become law. This in turn had evolved from earlier royal systems in which laws were simply issued by the monarch, as was the case for example in England until the reign of Edward III in the 14th century. In England itself, the power of the monarch to deny royal assent was not used after 1708, but it was used extensively in the British colonies. The heavy use of this power was mentioned in the U.S. Declaration of Independence in 1776.\nFollowing the French Revolution in 1789, the royal veto was hotly debated, and hundreds of proposals were put forward for different versions of the royal veto, as either absolute, suspensive, or nonexistent. With the adoption of the French Constitution of 1791, King Louis XVI lost his absolute veto and acquired the power to issue a suspensive veto that could be overridden by a majority vote in two successive sessions of the Legislative Assembly, which would take four to six years. With the abolition of the monarchy in 1792, the question of the French royal veto became moot.\nThe presidential veto was conceived in by republicans in the 18th and 19th centuries as a counter-majoritarian tool, limiting the power of a legislative majority. Some republican thinkers such as Thomas Jefferson, however, argued for eliminating the veto power entirely as a relic of monarchy. To avoid giving the president too much power, most early presidential vetoes, such as the veto power in the United States, were qualified vetoes that the legislature could override. But this was not always the case: the Chilean constitution of 1833, for example, gave that country's president an absolute veto.\nTypes.\nMost modern vetoes are intended as a check on the power of the government, or a branch of government, most commonly the legislative branch. Thus, in governments with a separation of powers, vetoes may be classified by the branch of government that enacts them: an executive veto, legislative veto, or judicial veto.\nHowever, other types of veto power have safeguarded other interests. The denial of royal assent by governors in the British colonies, which continued well after the practice had ended in Britain itself, served as a check by one level of government against another. Vetoes may also be used to safeguard the interests of particular groups within a country. The veto power of the ancient Roman tribunes protected the interests of one social class (the plebeians) against another (the patricians). In the transition from apartheid, a \"white veto\" to protect the interests of white South Africans was proposed but not adopted. More recently, indigenous vetoes over industrial projects on indigenous land have been proposed following the 2007 Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, which requires the \"free, prior and informed consent\" of indigenous communities to development or resource extraction projects on their land. However, many governments have been reluctant to allow such a veto.\nVetoes may be classified by whether the vetoed body can override them, and if so, how. An absolute veto cannot be overridden at all. A qualified veto can be overridden by a supermajority, such as two-thirds or three-fifths. A suspensory veto, also called a suspensive veto, can be overridden by a simple majority, and thus only delays the law from coming into force.\nTypes of executive vetoes.\nA package veto, also called a \"block veto\" or \"full veto\", vetoes a legislative act as a whole. Conversely, a partial veto, also called a line-item veto, allows the executive to object only to some specific part of the law while allowing the rest to stand. An executive with a partial veto has a stronger negotiating position than an executive with only a package veto power.\nAn amendatory veto or amendatory observation returns legislation to the legislature with proposed amendments, which the legislature may either adopt or override. The effect of legislative inaction may vary: in some systems, if the legislature does nothing, the vetoed bill fails, while in others, the vetoed bill becomes law. Because the amendatory veto gives the executive a stronger role in the legislative process, it is often seen as a marker of a particularly strong veto power.\nSome veto powers are limited to budgetary matters (as with line-item vetoes in some US states, or the financial veto in New Zealand). Other veto powers (such as in Finland) apply only to non-budgetary matters; some (such as in South Africa) apply only to constitutional matters. A veto power that is not limited in this way is known as a \"policy veto\".\nOne type of budgetary veto, the reduction veto, which is found in several US states, gives the executive the authority to reduce budgetary appropriations that the legislature has made. When an executive is given multiple different veto powers, the procedures for overriding them may differ. For example, in the US state of Illinois, if the legislature takes no action on a reduction veto, the reduction simply becomes law, while if the legislature takes no action on an amendatory veto, the bill dies.\nA pocket veto is a veto that takes effect simply by the executive or head of state taking no action. In the United States, the pocket veto can only be exercised near the end of a legislative session; if the deadline for presidential action passes \"during\" the legislative session, the bill will simply become law. The legislature cannot override a pocket veto.\nSome veto powers are limited in their subject matter. A constitutional veto only allows the executive to veto bills that are unconstitutional; in contrast, a \"policy veto\" can be used wherever the executive disagrees with the bill on policy grounds. Presidents with constitutional vetoes include those of Benin and South Africa.\nLegislative veto.\nA legislative veto is a veto power exercised by a legislative body. It may be a veto exercised by the legislature against an action of the executive branch, as in the case of the legislative veto in the United States, which is found in 28 US states. It may also be a veto power exercised by one chamber of a bicameral legislature against another, such as was formerly held by members of the Senate of Fiji appointed by the Great Council of Chiefs.\nVeto over candidates.\nIn certain political systems, a particular body is able to exercise a veto over candidates for an elected office. This type of veto may also be referred to by the broader term \"vetting\".\nHistorically, certain European Catholic monarchs were able to veto candidates for the papacy, a power known as the \"jus exclusivae\". This power was used for the last time in 1903 by Franz Joseph I of Austria.\nIn Iran, the Guardian Council has the power to approve or disapprove candidates, in addition to its veto power over legislation.\nIn China, following a pro-democracy landslide in the 2019 Hong Kong local elections, in 2021 the National People's Congress approved a law that gave the Candidate Eligibility Review Committee, appointed by the Chief Executive of Hong Kong, the power to veto candidates for the Hong Kong Legislative Council.\nBalance of powers.\nIn presidential and semi-presidential systems, the veto is a legislative power of the presidency, because it involves the president in the process of making law. In contrast to proactive powers such as the ability to introduce legislation, the veto is a reactive power, because the president cannot veto a bill until the legislature has passed it.\nExecutive veto powers are often ranked as comparatively \"strong\" or \"weak\". A veto power may be considered stronger or weaker depending on its scope, the time limits for exercising it and requirements for the vetoed body to override it. In general, the greater the majority required for an override, the stronger the veto.\nPartial vetoes are less vulnerable to override than package vetoes, and political scientists who have studied the matter have generally considered partial vetoes to give the executive greater power than package vetoes. However, empirical studies of the line-item veto in US state government have not found any consistent effect on the executive's ability to advance its agenda. Amendatory vetoes give greater power to the executive than deletional vetoes, because they give the executive the power to move policy closer to its own preferred state than would otherwise be possible. But even a suspensory package veto that can be overridden by a simple majority can be effective in stopping or modifying legislation. For example, in Estonia in 1993, president Lennart Meri was able to successfully obtain amendments to the proposed Law on Aliens after issuing a suspensory veto of the bill and proposing amendments based on expert opinions on European law. \nWorldwide.\nGlobally, the executive veto over legislation is characteristic of presidential and semi-presidential systems, with stronger veto powers generally being associated with stronger presidential powers overall. In parliamentary systems, the veto power of the head of state is typically weak or nonexistent. In particular, in Westminster systems and most constitutional monarchies, the power to veto legislation by withholding royal assent is a rarely used reserve power of the monarch. In practice, the Crown follows the convention of exercising its prerogative on the advice of parliament.\nEurope.\nEuropean countries in which the executive or head of state does not have a veto power include Slovenia and Luxembourg, where the power to withhold royal assent was abolished in 2008. Countries that have some form of veto power include the following:\nThe President of Ireland does not possess the power to veto a bill. Article 26 simply involves an exploration of a bill's constitutionality, while Article 27 simply adjusts the process of lawmaking to include a consultation with the people either in a referendum or general election. In both cases the final decision is made by someone else, the Supreme Court or the people. No one action by a president can kill a bill.\nVeto theories.\nIn political science, the broader power of people and groups to prevent change is sometimes analyzed through the frameworks of veto points and veto players. Veto players are actors who can potentially exercise some sort of veto over a change in government policy. Veto points are the institutional opportunities that give these actors the ability to veto. The theory of veto points was first developed by Ellen M. Immergut in 1990, in a comparative case study of healthcare reform in different political systems. Breaking with earlier scholarship, Immergut argued that \"we have veto \"points\" within political systems and not veto \"groups\" within societies.\"\nVeto player analysis draws on game theory. George Tsebelis first developed it in 1995 and set it forth in detail in 2002 \"\". A veto player is a political actor who has the ability to stop a change from the status quo. There are institutional veto players, whose consent is required by constitution or statute; for example, in US federal legislation, the veto players are the House, Senate and presidency. There are also partisan veto players, which are groups that can block policy change from inside an institutional veto player. In a coalition government the partisan veto players are typically the members of the governing coalition.\nAccording to Tsebelis' veto player theorem, policy change becomes harder the more veto players there are, the greater the ideological distance between them, and the greater their internal coherence. For example, Italy and the United States have stable policies because they have many veto players, while Greece and the United Kingdom have unstable policies because they have few veto players.\nWhile the veto player and veto point approaches complement one another, the veto players framework has become dominant in the study of policy change. Scholarship on rational choice theory has favored the veto player approach because the veto point framework does not address \"why\" political actors decide to use a veto point. In addition, because veto player analysis can apply to any political system, it provides a way of comparing very different political systems, such as presidential and parliamentary systems. Veto player analyses can also incorporate people and groups that have \"de facto\" power to prevent policy change, even if they do not have the legal power to do so.\nSome literature distinguishes cooperative veto points (within institutions) and competitive veto points (between institutions), theorizing competitive veto points contribute to obstructionism. Some literature disagrees with the claim of veto player theory that multiparty governments are likely to be gridlocked.\nWorks cited.\nConstitutions cited.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He was at first junior co-ruler of his half-brother, then was sidelined by a usurper, and finally became sole ruler after 388, albeit with limited \"de facto\" powers. He was the youngest emperor (co-ruler) in the Western Roman Empire (aged 4).\nA son of emperor Valentinian I and empress Justina, he was raised to the imperial office at the age of four by military commanders upon his father's death. Until 383, Valentinian II remained a junior partner to his older half-brother Gratian in ruling the Western empire, while the East was governed by his uncle Valens until 378 and Theodosius I from 379. When the usurper emperor Magnus Maximus killed Gratian in 383, the court of Valentinian II in Milan became the locus of confrontations between adherents to Nicene and Arian Christianity. In 387, Maximus invaded Italy, spurring Valentinian II and his family to escape to Thessalonica where they successfully sought Theodosius's aid. Theodosius defeated Maximus in battle and re-installed Valentinian II.\nValentinian II ruled from Gaul after being restored to power in 388. He was largely under the control of Arbogast, a powerful general and regent. In 392, Valentinian II was found dead in his palace, a death some at the time believed was a suicide and others a murder orchestrated by Arbogast, whom the emperor had tried to dismiss.\nEarly life and accession (371\u2013375).\nHe was born Valentinianus to Emperor Valentinian I and his second wife Justina. His paternal half-brother Gratian had been sharing the imperial title with their father since 367. He had three sisters: Galla, Grata and Justa.\nThe elder Valentinian died on campaign in Pannonia in 375. Neither Gratian (then in Trier) nor his uncle Valens (emperor of the East) were consulted by the army commanders on the scene. The four-year-old Valentinianus and his mother Justina were living in Sirmium or an imperial villa near Carnuntum.\nValentinian I's leading generals and officials did not acknowledge Gratian as his father's successor. These officials\u2014among them Merobaudes, Petronius Probus, Equitius and Cerealis (Valentinianus's maternal uncle), instead had the four-year-old Valentinianus brought to Aquincum where they named him \"augustus\" Valentinian II on 22 November 375.\nThe army and its Frankish general Merobaudes were likely concerned about Gratian's limited military skills and\u2014to prevent a split within its ranks\u2014elevated the four-year-old to emperor, with the generals assuming that they themselves would take command.\nMerobaudes may have also wanted to prevent rivals such as Sebastianus and Count Theodosius (not to be confused with Emperor Theodosius I) from becoming emperor or gaining independent power; within a year of Valentinian's elevation, Sebastianus was removed to a distant posting and Count Theodosius was executed.\nReign from Milan (375\u2013387).\nGratian was forced to accommodate the generals who supported his half-brother; he purportedly enjoyed seeing to Valentinian's education. According to Zosimus, Gratian governed the trans-alpine provinces including Gaul, Hispania, and Britain; Valentinian was nominally ruler of Italy (part of Illyricum) and North Africa. In fact, however, Gratian governed the whole Western empire; Valentinian was marginalized and did not issue any laws. In 378 their uncle Emperor Valens was killed by the Goths in Adrianople; Gratian invited the general Theodosius to be emperor in the East. As a child, Valentinian II was under the pro-Arian influence of his mother the empress Justina and of the courtiers at Milan. Such influence was opposed by the Nicene bishop of Milan, Ambrose.\nIn 383, Magnus Maximus, commander of the armies in Britain, declared himself Emperor and established his headquarters in Gaul and Hispania. Gratian was killed while fleeing him. As a lesser partner in the West, Valentinian was largely ineffectual and obscure until the usurpation by Maximus and death of Gratian. For a time the court of Valentinian, through the mediation of Ambrose, came to an accommodation with the usurper, and Theodosius recognized Maximus as co-emperor of the West.\nValentinian tried to restrain the despoiling of pagan Roman temples. In 384 the pagan senators, led by the Prefect of Rome Aurelius Symmachus, petitioned the emperor for the restoration of the Altar of Victory in the Senate House which had been removed by Gratian in 382. Valentinian refused the request and, in so doing, rejected the traditions and rituals of pagan Rome to which Symmachus had appealed. While Ambrose participated in the campaign against the reinstatement of Altar of Victory, he admitted he was not the cause of the decision to remove the altar in the first place.\nIn 385 Ambrose refused an imperial order to hand over the Portian Basilica (now the Basilica of San Vittore al Corpo) for the celebration of Easter by the Imperial court. His refusal angered not just Valentinian but also Justina, high-ranking officials, and court Arians including Goths. Ambrose argued in his letter that Justina influenced her young son to oppose the Nicean party championed by Ambrose, and framed her motivation as purely selfish.\nBut the wider imperial court also opposed Ambrose's claim, and the praetorian prefect and the emperor's counsellors demanded that he turn over the basilica. When Ambrose was summoned to the court for punishment the orthodox populace rioted. Gothic troops attempted to enter the Basilica; Ambrose stood in the doorway, and the Goths did not enter. Rufinus claimed that when Ambrose was found guilty of breaking the new laws Justina persuaded Valentinian to have him banished, and that Ambrose barricaded himself within the walls of the Basilica, with the enthusiastic backing of the people. Rufinus says that the imperial troops besieged Ambrose but he held on, and that he found the bodies of two ancient Christian martyrs beneath the foundations of the church which raised the spirits of the people. Magnus Maximus tried to use the emperor's heterodoxy against him in a war of public opinion. To this end, he wrote a scathing missive attacking Valentinian for plotting against God.\nIn 386 to 387, Maximus crossed the Alps into the Po valley to threaten Milan. Valentinian II and Justina fled to Emperor Theodosius I in Thessalonica. The latter came to an agreement, cemented by his marriage to Valentinian's sister Galla, to restore the young emperor in the West. Theodosius and his forces marched west in 388 and defeated Maximus.\nReign from Vienne (388\u2013392).\nAfter the defeat of Maximus, Valentinian took no part in Theodosius' triumphal celebrations over Maximus. He and his court were installed at Vienne in Gaul. Justina had already died, and Vienne was far away from the influence of Ambrose. In a panegyric for Theodosius, the orator Pacatus asserted that the empire belonged to his two sons, Arcadius and Honorius, while barely mentioning the newly restored Valentinian. Theodosius remained in Milan until 391, appointing his supporters to important offices in the West. On the Eastern emperor's coinage, Valentinian continued to be represented with the \"unbroken\" legend like Arcadius, depicting both of them as Theodosius' junior colleagues. Modern scholars, observing Theodosius' actions, suspect that he had no intention of allowing Valentinian to rule, due to his plan for his sons to succeed him.\nWhen Theodosius decided to return to the East, his trusted general, the Frank Arbogast, was appointed magister militum for the Western provinces (bar Africa) and guardian of Valentinian. Acting in the name of Valentinian, Arbogast was actually subordinate only to Theodosius. While the general campaigned successfully on the Rhine, the young emperor remained confined at Vienne, in contrast to his warrior father and his older brother, who had campaigned at his age. Arbogast's domination over the emperor was to the point where, in a report that Hebblewhite characterized as \"admittedly outlandish\"; the general is described as murdering Harmonius, a friend of Valentinian suspected of taking bribes, in the emperor's presence. Valentinian wrote to Theodosius and Ambrose complaining of his subordination to his general. In explicit rejection of his earlier Arianism, he invited Ambrose to come to Vienne to baptize him.\nThe crisis reached a peak when Arbogast prohibited the emperor from leading the Gallic armies into Italy to oppose a barbarian threat. Valentinian, in response, formally dismissed Arbogast. The latter ignored the order, publicly tearing it up and arguing that Valentinian had not appointed him in the first place. The reality of where the power lay was openly displayed.\nDeath.\nOn 15 May 392, Valentinian was found hanged in his residence in Vienne. Arbogast maintained that the emperor's death was suicide. Many sources believe, however, that the general had him murdered; ancient historians were divided in their opinion. Some modern scholars lean toward suicide. McEvoy, Williams and Friell asserted that Arbogast had little reason to change his situation, while McLynn observed how no one benefitted from the emperor's death. Ambrose's eulogy is the only contemporary Western source for Valentinian's death. It is ambiguous on the question of the emperor's death, which is not surprising, as Ambrose represents him as a model of Christian virtue. Suicide, not murder, would make the bishop dissemble on this key question.\nThe young man's body was conveyed in ceremony to Milan for burial by Ambrose, mourned by his sisters Justa and Grata. He was laid in a porphyry sarcophagus next to his brother Gratian, most probably in the Chapel of Sant'Aquilino attached to San Lorenzo. He was deified with the .\nAt first Arbogast recognized Theodosius's son Arcadius as emperor in the West, seemingly surprised by his charge's death. After three months, during which he had no communication from Theodosius, Arbogast selected an imperial official, Eugenius, as emperor. Theodosius initially tolerated this regime but, in January 393, elevated the eight-year-old Honorius as \"augustus\" to succeed Valentinian II. Civil war ensued and, in 394, Theodosius defeated Eugenius and Arbogast at the Battle of the Frigidus.\nSignificance.\nConstantine I and his sons re-established the practice of hereditary succession, a system that Valentinian I continued to maintain. However, from the Crisis of the Third Century the empire had been ruled by campaigning emperors. This trend came to a break with the reign of Valentinian II, a child. Valentinian seems to have lacked authority as a figurehead for various interests: his mother, his co-emperors, and powerful generals. His reign was a harbinger of the fifth century, when young emperors were controlled by powerful generals and officials until mid-century (Honorius, Arcadius, Theodosius II, Valentinian III and Romulus Augustulus).\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\n "}
{"id": "74664", "revid": "16120725", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=74664", "title": "Cave of the Patriarchs", "text": "Holy site in Hebron, Palestine\nThe Cave of the Patriarchs or Tomb of the Patriarchs, known to Jews by its Biblical name Cave of Machpelah () and to Muslims as the Ibrahami Mosque (), or Sanctuary of Ibrahim (), is a series of caves situated in the heart of the Old City of Hebron in the West Bank, south of Jerusalem. According to the Abrahamic religions, the cave and adjoining field were purchased by Abraham as a burial plot, although most historians believe the Abraham-Isaac-Jacob narrative to be primarily mythological. The site is considered a holy place in Judaism, Christianity, and Islam.\nOver the cave stands a large rectangular enclosure dating from the Herodian era. During Byzantine rule of the region, a Christian basilica was built on the site; the structure was converted into the Ibrahimi Mosque following the Muslim conquest of the Levant. By the 12th century, the mosque and its surrounding regions had fallen under Crusader-state control, but were retaken in 1188 by the Ayyubid sultan Saladin, who again converted the structure into a mosque. In 1119 CE, a monk found bones inside the cave, believing them to be the bones of the patriarchs. \nDuring the Six-Day War of 1967, the entire Jordanian-ruled West Bank was seized and occupied by the State of Israel, after which the mosque was divided, with half of it repurposed as a synagogue. In 1968, special Jewish services were authorized outside the usual permitted hours on the Jewish New Year and Day of Atonement, leading to a hand-grenade attack on 9 October which injured 47 Israelis; and a second bombing on 4 November, which wounded 6 people. In 1972, the Israeli government increased the Jewish prayer area. New changes to the \"status quo\" were made by Israeli authorities in 1975, which again led to protests by Muslims. \nIn 1976, a scuffle took place between Jewish and Muslim worshippers, during which a Quran was torn. Muslim and Arab figures went to Hebron the next day to protest what was called a \"profanation of the Quran\". The Tomb was closed and a curfew was imposed on the whole city. A few days later, about two hundred Arab youths entered the Tomb and destroyed Torah scrolls and prayer books. In May 1980, an attack on Jewish worshippers returning from prayers at the tomb left 6 dead and 17 wounded. In 1994, the Cave of the Patriarchs massacre occurred at the Ibrahimi Mosque, in which an armed Israeli settler entered the complex during the Islamic holy month of Ramadan and opened fire on Palestinian Muslims who had gathered to pray at the site, killing 29 people, including children, and wounding over 125.\nEtymology of \"Makhpela\".\nAmoraic proposals.\nThe etymology of the Biblical name for the site, \"Me'arat haMakhpela\", is uncertain. The word \"Me'arat\" means \"cave of\" and \"haMakhpela\" may mean \"doubled\", \"multiplied\" or \"twofold\", so a literal translation would be \"cave of the double\". Two hypotheses are discussed by the Talmud in b. Eruvin 53a:The cave of \"makhpela\": Abba Arikha and Samuel of Nehardea [disputed]; one said, \"It is two chambers, one behind the other\", and one said, \"It is two chambers, one above the other.\"The position that the chambers are stacked is satisfactory\u2014this is \"makhpela\". However, according to the position that one is behind the other, what is \"makhpela\"? That it is doubled in [that it contains] couples:\"And Jacob came to his father Isaac, [to] Mamre, the 'City of the Four' which is Hebron ...\" (Gen. 35:27). Isaac the Smith said, \"The City of the Four Couples: Adam and Eve, Abraham and Sarah, Isaac and Rebecca, and Jacob and Leah\".According to b. Bava Batra 58a, Abba Arikha and Samuel of Nehardea agreed that the two chambers, whatever their layout, shared identical dimensions. Genesis Rabbah 58 gives a third hypothesis:\"And Epron's field which was in the \"makhpela\" ...\" (Gen. 23:17). This teaches that it universally \"doubles\" the renown of those [within], as whoever is interred within is believed to have earned a very great reward [in Heaven].\nLater scholarship.\nSaadia b. Joseph and Abraham ibn Ezra believed it referred to a \"cave within a cave\". Another hypothesis, supported by Samuel b. Meir, Moses b. Nachman, Obadiah Sforno, Moses Mendelssohn, Ernst Rosenm\u00fcller, and Samuel David Luzzatto, holds that \"makhpela\" isn't an adjective describing the cave but rather is a proper noun describing the tract of land on which it sits. This hypothesis is supported by the phrasing of some Bible verses, such as , \"the cave in the field of the Makhpela . . .\" The question over the right interpretation of \"makhpela\" has been discussed extensively in various Biblical commentaries.\n\"Strong's Concordance\" derives \"makhpela\" from \"kaphal\", a verb meaning \u201cto double\u201d.\nBiblical origin.\nAccording to , Abraham's wife Sarah dies in Kiryat Arba near Hebron in the land of Canaan at the age of 127, being the only woman in the Bible whose exact age is given, while Abraham is tending to business elsewhere. Abraham comes to mourn for her. After a while he stands up and speaks to the Biblical Hittites. He tells them that he is a foreigner in their land and requests that they give him a burial site so that he can bury his dead. The Hittites flatter Abraham, call him a Lord and mighty prince, and say that he can bury his dead in any of their tombs. Abraham doesn't take them up on their offer and instead asks them to contact Ephron the Hittite, the son of Zohar, who lives in Mamre and owns the cave of Machpelah which he is offering to buy for \"the full price\". Ephron slyly replies that he is prepared to give Abraham the field and the cave within it, knowing that it would not result in Abraham having a permanent claim to it. Abraham politely refuses the offer and insists on paying for the field. Ephron replies that the field is worth four hundred shekels of silver and Abraham agrees to the price without any further bargaining. He then proceeded to bury his dead wife Sarah there.\nThe burial of Sarah is the first account of a burial in the Bible, and Abraham's purchase of Machpelah is the first commercial transaction mentioned.\nThe next burial in the cave is that of Abraham himself, who at the age of 175 years was buried by his sons Isaac and Ishmael. The title deed to the cave was part of the property of Abraham that passed to his son Isaac. The third burial was that of Isaac, by his two sons Esau and Jacob, who died when he was 180 years old. There is no mention of how or when Isaac's wife Rebecca died, but she is included in the list of those that had been buried in Machpelah in Jacob's final words to the children of Israel. Jacob himself died at the age of 147 years.\nIn the final chapter of Genesis, Joseph had his physicians embalm his father Jacob, before they removed him from Egypt to be buried in the cave of the field of Machpelah. When Joseph died in the last verse, he was also embalmed. He was buried much later in Shechem after the children of Israel came into the Promised Land.\nExtra-biblical parallels.\nIn the Ugaritic texts (13th\u201312th century BCE), three out of the six real estate contracts discovered were for the sum of 400 silver shekels, and the terms of sale in them parallel the Biblical description of the sale of Machpelah. Apparently 400 shekels was a common price for Canaanite real estate transactions in this period.\nHistory.\nFirst and Second Temple period.\nIn 2020, Israeli archaeologists led by David Ben-Shlomo (Ariel University) dated pottery from the caves (recovered surreptitiously by local residents in 1981) to the 8th century BCE. The different origins of the shards, from various areas around Hebron and Jerusalem, suggest the site may have been a pilgrimage site as early as this date, according to the study authors.\nThe time from which the Israelites regarded the site as sacred is unknown, though some scholars consider that the biblical story of Abraham's burial there probably dates from the 6th century BCE.\nBetween 31 and 4 BCE, Herod the Great built a large, rectangular enclosure over the cave to commemorate the site for his subjects. It is the only fully surviving Herodian structure from the period of Hellenistic Judaism. Herod's building, with stone walls made from stones that were at least tall and sometimes reach a length of , did not have a roof. Archaeologists are not certain where the original entrance to the enclosure was located, or even if there was one. The Herodian building stands on an earlier structure possibly built during the Hasmonean dynasty (c. 2nd century BCE).\nByzantine Christian period.\nUntil the era of the Byzantine Empire, the interior of the enclosure remained exposed to the sky. Under Byzantine rule, a simple basilica was constructed at the southeastern end and the enclosure was roofed everywhere except at the centre.\nDuring this period, the site became an important Christian pilgrimage destination. The Pilgrim of Bordeaux, c. 333, reported \"a monument of square form built of stone of wondrous beauty, in which lie Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Sara, Rebecca, and Leah\". The Piacenza Pilgrim (c. 570) noted in his pilgrimage account that Jews and Christians shared possession of the site.\nArab period.\nIn 614, the Sasanid Persians conquered the area and destroyed the castle, leaving only ruins; but in 637, the area came under the control of the Arab Muslims and the building was reconstructed as a roofed mosque.\nThe Muslims permitted the building of two small synagogues at the site.\nDuring the 10th century, an entrance was pierced through the north-eastern wall, some way above the external ground level, and steps from the north and from the east were built up to it (one set of steps for entering, the other for leaving). A building known as the \"qal'ah\" (\u0642\u0644\u0639\u0629 i.e. \"castle\") was also constructed near the middle of the southwestern side. Its purpose is unknown but one historic account claims that it marked the spot where Joseph was buried (see Joseph's Tomb), the area having been excavated by a Muslim caliph, under the influence of a local tradition regarding Joseph's tomb. Some archaeologists believe that the original entrance to Herod's structure was in the location of the \"qal'ah\" and that the northeastern entrance was created so that the kalah could be built by the former entrance.\nCrusader period.\nIn 1100, after the area was captured by the Crusaders, the enclosure once again became a church and Muslims were no longer permitted to enter. During this period, the area was given a new gabled roof, clerestory windows and vaulting.\nWhen the Crusaders took control of the site Jews were banned from using the synagogues.\nIn the year 1113 during the reign of Baldwin II of Jerusalem, according to Ali of Herat (writing in 1173), a certain part over the cave of Abraham had given way, and \"a number of Franks had made their entrance therein\". And they discovered \"(the bodies) of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob\", \"their shrouds having fallen to pieces, lying propped up against a wall. ... Then the King, after providing new shrouds, caused the place to be closed once more\". Similar information is given in Ibn al Athir's Chronicle under the year 1119; \"In this year was opened the tomb of Abraham, and those of his two sons Isaac and Jacob. ... Many people saw the Patriarch. Their limbs had nowise been disturbed, and beside them were placed lamps of gold and of silver.\" The Damascene nobleman and historian Ibn al-Qalanisi in his chronicle also alludes at this time to the discovery of relics purported to be those of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, a discovery that excited eager curiosity among all three communities in the southern Levant, Muslim, Jewish, and Christian.\nTowards the end of the period of Crusader rule, in 1166 Maimonides visited Hebron and wrote, \"On Sunday, 9 Marheshvan (17 October), I left Jerusalem for Hebron to kiss the tombs of my ancestors in the Cave. On that day, I stood in the cave and prayed, praise be to God, (in gratitude) for everything.\"\nIn 1170, Benjamin of Tudela visited the city, which he called by its Frankish name, St. Abram de Bron. He reported:\n\"Here that there is the great church called St. Abram, and this was a Jewish place of worship at the time of the Mohammedan rule, but the Gentiles have erected there six tombs, respectively called those of Abraham and Sarah, Isaac and Rebekah, Jacob and Leah. The custodians tell the pilgrims that these are the tombs of the Patriarchs, for which information the pilgrims give them money. If a Jew comes, however, and gives a special reward, the custodian of the cave opens unto him a gate of iron, which was constructed by our forefathers, and then he is able to descend below by means of steps, holding a lighted candle in his hand. He then reaches a cave, in which nothing is to be found, and a cave beyond, which is likewise empty, but when he reaches the third cave behold there are six sepulchres, those of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, respectively facing those of Sarah, Rebekah and Leah, upon which the names of the three Patriarchs and their wives are inscribed in Hebrew characters. The cave is filled with barrels containing bones of people, which are taken there as to a sacred place. At the end of the field of the Machpelah stands Abraham's house with a spring in front of it\".\nAyyubid period.\nIn 1188 Saladin conquered the area, reconverting the enclosure to a mosque but allowing Christians to continue worshipping there. Saladin also added a minaret at each corner\u2014two of which still survive\u2014and added an existing minbar (pulpit) from the Shrine of Husayn's Head near Ascalon to the mosque's interior. Samuel ben Samson visited the cave in 1210; he says that the visitor must descend by twenty-four steps in a passageway so narrow that the rock touches him on either hand.\nMamluk period.\nBetween 1318 and 1320, the Mamluk governor of Gaza, a province that included Hebron, Sanjar al-Jawli ordered the construction of the Amir Jawli Mosque within the Haram enclosure to enlarge the prayer space and accommodate worshipers. In the late 14th century, under the Mamluks, two additional entrances were pierced into the western end of the south western side and the \"kalah\" was extended upwards to the level of the rest of the enclosure. A cenotaph in memory of Joseph was created in the upper level of the \"kalah\" so that visitors to the enclosure would not need to leave and travel round the outside just to pay respects. The Mamluks also built the northwestern staircase and the six cenotaphs (for Isaac, Rebecca, Jacob, Leah, Abraham, and Sarah, respectively), distributed evenly throughout the enclosure. The Mamluks forbade Jews from entering the site, allowing them only as close as the fifth step on a staircase at the southeast, but after some time this was increased to the seventh step.\nThe Jewish geographer Ishtori Haparchi, who visited the site in the 14th century, reported that a large square of high wall surrounded the tomb. According to a local tradition he recorded there, the stones of the wall were taken from the Temple built by King Solomon.\nOttoman period.\nDuring the Ottoman period, the dilapidated state of the patriarchs' tombs was restored, with Ali Bey, one of the few foreigners to gain access, reporting in 1807 that,all the sepulchres of the patriarchs are covered with rich carpets of green silk, magnificently embroidered with gold; those of the wives are red, embroidered in like manner. The sultans of Constantinople furnish these carpets, which are renewed from time to time. Ali Bey counted nine, one over the other, upon the sepulchre of Abraham.\nA contemporary traveller, M. Ermete Pierotti, in 1862 described the great jealousy with which the Muslims guarded the sanctuary and the practice of sending petitions to the patriarchs:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The true entrance to the Patriarchs' tomb is to be seen close to the western wall of the enclosure, and near the north-west comer; it is guarded by a very thick iron railing, and I was not allowed to go near it. I observed that the Mussulmans themselves did not go very near it. In the court opposite the entrance gate of the Mosque, there is an opening, through which I was allowed to go down for three steps, and I was able to ascertain by sight and touch that the rock exists there, and to conclude it to be about five feet thick. From the short observations I could make during my brief descent, as also from the consideration of the east wall of the Mosque, and the little information I extracted from the Chief Santon, who jealously guards the sanctuary, I consider that a part of the grotto exists under the Mosque, and that the other part is under the court, but at a lower level than that lying under the Mosque. This latter must be separated from the former by a vertical stratum of rock which contains an opening, as I conclude, for two reasons : first, because the east wall being entirely solid and massive, requires a good foundation; secondly, because the petitions which the Mussulmans present to the Santon to be transmitted to the Patriarchs are thrown, some through one opening, some through the other, according to the Patriarch to whom they are directed; and the Santon goes down by the way I went, whence I suppose that on that side there is a vestibule, and that the tombs may be found below it. I explained my conjectures to the Santon himself after leaving the Mosque, and he showed himself very much surprised at the time, and told the Pacha afterwards that I knew more about it than the Turks themselves. The fact is that even the Pacha who governs the province has no right to penetrate into the sacred enclosure, where (according to the Mussulman legend) the Patriarchs are living, and only condescend to receive the petitions addressed to them by mortals.\nJordanian control.\nAfter Jordan occupied the West Bank in 1948, no Jews were allowed in the territory and consequently no Jews could visit the tomb. In the 1960s, Jordan renovated the area surrounding the mosque, destroying several historical buildings in the process, among them, the ruins of the nearby Crusader fortress built in 1168.\nIsraeli control.\nFollowing the Israeli occupation of the West Bank in the Six-Day War, Hebron came under Jewish control for the first time in 2,000 years, though restrictions on visits by Jews were to continue. According to the autobiography of the Chief Rabbi of the Israel Defense Forces, Major general Rabbi Shlomo Goren, during the Six-Day War on 8 June 1967, he made his way from Gush Etzion to Hebron. In Hebron he realized that the Arabs had surrendered and quickly made his way to the Cave of the Patriarchs. He shot at the doors of the mosque with his Uzi submachine gun. But when that was ineffective in prying the doors open, he attached chains to his Jeep and the doors, proceeding to pull them down. He entered the mosque and began to pray. While praying, a messenger from the Mufti of Hebron delivered a surrender note to him, whereby the rabbi replied \"This place, Ma'arat HaMachpela, is a place of prayer and peace. Surrender elsewhere.\"\nThe first Jew to enter the burial caves was Michal Arbel, the 13-year-old daughter of Yehuda Arbel, chief of Shin Bet operations in the West Bank, because she was slender enough to be lowered into the narrow, wide hole on 9 October 1968, to gain access to the tomb site, after which she took photographs.\nIsraeli settlers reestablished a small synagogue under the mosque. The first Jewish wedding ceremony to take place in it was on 7 August 1968. The stone stairway leading to the mosque was also destroyed in order to erase the humiliating \"seventh step\".\nIn 1968, a special arrangement was made to accommodate Jewish services on the Jewish New Year and Day of Atonement. This led to an attack on worshippers, with a hand-grenade being thrown on the stairway leading to the tomb on 9 October; 47 Israelis were injured, 8 seriously. On 4 November, a large explosion went off near the gate to the compound and 6 people, Jews and Arabs, were wounded. On Yom Kippur eve, 3 October 1976, an Arab mob destroyed several Torah scrolls and prayer books at the tomb. In May 1980, an attack on Jewish worshippers returning from prayers at the tomb left 6 dead and 17 wounded.\nIn 1981, a group of Jewish settlers from the Hebron community led by Noam Arnon broke into the caves and took photos of the burial chambers.\nTensions would later increase as the Israeli government signed the Oslo Accords in September 1993, which gave limited autonomy to the PLO in the West Bank city of Jericho and the Gaza Strip. The city of Hebron and the rest of the major Palestinian population centers in the West Bank were not included in the initial agreement. The Cave of the Patriarchs massacre committed by Baruch Goldstein, an Israeli-American settler in February 1994, left 29 Palestinian Muslims dead and scores injured. The resulting riots resulted in a further 35 deaths.\nThe increased sensitivity of the site meant that in 1996 the Wye River Accords, part of the Arab\u2013Israeli peace process, included a temporary status agreement for the site restricting access for both Jews and Muslims. As part of this agreement, the \"waqf\" (Islamic charitable trust) controls 81% of the building. This includes the whole of the southeastern section, which lies above the only known entrance to the caves and possibly over the entirety of the caves themselves. As a consequence, Jews are not permitted to visit the Cenotaphs of Isaac or Rebecca, which lie entirely within the southeastern section, except for 10 days a year that hold special significance in Judaism. One of these days is the Shabbat \"Chayei Sarah\", when the Torah portion concerning the death of Sarah and the purchase by Abraham of the land in which the caves are situated, is read.\nThe Israeli authorities do not allow Jewish religious authorities the right to maintain the site and allow only the \"waqf\" to do so. Tourists are permitted to enter the site. Security at the site has increased since the Intifada; the Israel Defense Forces surround the site with soldiers and control access to the shrines. Israeli forces also subject locals to checkpoints and bar all non-Jews from setting foot on some of the main roads to the complex and ban Palestinian vehicles from many of the roads in the area.\nOn 21 February 2010, Israel announced that it would include the site in a national heritage site protection and rehabilitation plan. The announcement sparked protests from the UN, Arab governments and the United States. A subsequent UNESCO vote in October aimed to affirm that the \"al-Haram al-Ibrahimi/Tomb of the Patriarchs in al-Khalil/Hebron\"\nwas \"an integral part of the occupied Palestinian Territories.\"\nIsraeli authorities have placed restrictions on calling the faithful to prayer by the muezzin of the Ibrahimi mosque. The order was enforced 61 times in October 2014, and 52 times in December of that year. This was following numerous complaints by the Jewish residents who claim that the calls violate legal decibel limits. In December 2009 Israeli authorities banned Jewish music played at the cave following similar complaints from the Arab residents.\nStructure.\nBuilding.\nThe rectangular stone enclosure lies on a northwest\u2013southeast axis, and is divided into two sections by a wall running between the northwestern three fifths, and the southeastern two fifths. The northwestern section is roofed on three sides, the central area and north eastern side being open to the sky; the southeastern section is fully roofed, the roof being supported by four columns evenly distributed through the section.\nNearly the entire building itself was built by King Herod and it remains the only Herodian building surviving today virtually intact.\nIn the northwestern section are four cenotaphs, each housed in a separate octagonal room, those dedicated to Jacob and Leah being on the northwest, and those to Abraham and Sarah on the southeast. A corridor runs between the cenotaphs on the northwest, and another between those on the southeast. A third corridor runs the length of the southwestern side, through which access to the cenotaphs, and to the southeastern section, can be gained. An entrance to the enclosure exists on the southwestern side, entering this third corridor; a mosque outside this entrance must be passed through to gain access.\nAt the center of the northeastern side, there is another entrance, which enters the roofed area on the southeastern side of the northwestern section and through which access can also be gained to the southeastern (fully roofed) section. This entrance is approached on the outside by a corridor which leads from a long staircase running most of the length of the northwestern side. The southeastern section, which functions primarily as a mosque, contains two cenotaphs, symmetrically placed, near the center, dedicated to Isaac and Rebecca. Between them, in the southeastern wall, is a mihrab. The cenotaphs have a distinctive red and white horizontal striped pattern to their stonework but are usually covered by decorative cloth.\nUnder the present arrangements, Jews are restricted to entering by the southwestern side, and limited to the southwestern corridor and the corridors that run between the cenotaphs, while Muslims may enter only by the northeastern side but are allowed free rein of the remainder of the enclosure.\nCaves.\nThe caves under the enclosure are not themselves generally accessible; the waqf have historically prevented access to the actual tombs out of respect for the dead. Only two entrances are known to exist, the most visible of which is located to the immediate southeast of Abraham's cenotaph on the inside of the southeastern section. This entrance is a narrow shaft covered by a decorative grate, which itself is covered by an elaborate dome. The other entrance is located to the southeast, near the mihrab, and is sealed by a large stone, and usually covered by prayer mats; this is very close to the location of the \"seventh step\" on the outside of the enclosure, beyond which the Mamelukes forbade Jews from approaching.\nWhen the enclosure was controlled by crusaders, access was occasionally possible. One account, by Rabbi Benjamin of Tudela dating from 1163 CE, states that after passing through an iron door, and descending, the caves would be encountered. According to Benjamin of Tudela, there was a sequence of three caves, the first two of which were empty; in the third cave were six tombs, arranged to be opposite to one another.\nThese caves had been rediscovered only in 1119 CE by a monk named Arnoul, after an unnamed monk at prayer \"noticed a draught\" in the area near the present location of the mihrab and, with other \"brethren\", removed the flagstones and found a room lined with Herodian masonry. Arnoul, still searching for the source of the draught, hammered on the cave walls until he heard a hollow sound, pulled down the masonry in that area, and discovered a narrow passage. The narrow passage, which subsequently became known as the \"serdab\" (Arabic for \"passage\"), was similarly lined with masonry, but partly blocked up. Having unblocked the passage, Arnoul discovered a large round room with plastered walls. In the floor of the room, he found a square stone slightly different from the others and, upon removing it, found the first of the caves. The caves were filled with dust. After removing the dust, Arnoul found bones; believing the bones to be those of the biblical Patriarchs, Arnoul washed them in wine and stacked them neatly. Arnoul carved inscriptions on the cave walls describing whose bones he believed them to be.This passage to the caves was sealed at some time after Saladin had recaptured the area, though the roof of the circular room was pierced, and a decorative grate was placed over it. In 1967, after the Six-Day War, the area fell into the hands of the Israel Defense Forces, and Moshe Dayan, the Defence Minister, who was an amateur archaeologist, attempted to regain access to the tombs. Ignorant of the \"serdab\" entrance, Dayan concentrated his attention on the shaft visible below the decorative grate and had the idea of sending someone thin enough to fit through the shaft and down into the chamber below. Dayan eventually found a slim 12-year-old girl named Michal to assist and sent her into the chamber with a camera.\nMichal explored the round chamber, but failed to find the square stone in the floor that led to the caves. Michal did, however, explore the passage and find steps leading up to the surface, though the exit was blocked by a large stone (this is the entrance near the mihrab). According to the report of her findings, which Michal gave to Dayan after having been lifted back through the shaft, there are 16 steps leading down into the passage, which is 1 cubit wide, and high. In the round chamber, which is below the entrance to the shaft, there are three stone slabs, the middle of which contains a partial inscription of Sura 2, verse 255, from the Quran, the famous Ayatul Kursi, Verse of the Throne.\nIn 1981, Seev Jevin, the former director of the Israel Antiquities Authority, entered the passage after a group of Jewish settlers from Hebron had entered the chamber via the entrance near the mihrab and discovered the square stone in the round chamber that concealed the cave entrance. The reports state that after entering the first cave, which seemed to Jevin to be empty, he found a passage leading to a second oval chamber, smaller than the first, which contained shards of pottery and a wine jug. Findings published in the \"Israel Exploration Journal\" in 2020 stated that the pottery dated from the 8th century BCE and originated from various locations in the Hebron and Jerusalem areas.\nReligions beliefs and traditions.\nJudaism.\nAccording to the Book of Genesis, Abraham specifically purchased the land for use as a burial plot from Ephron the Hittite, making it one of two purchases by Abraham of real estate in the Land of Canaan, the Promised Land. The book describes how the three patriarchs and their wives, the matriarchs, were buried there.\nThe only matriarch missing is Jacob's other wife, Rachel, described in Genesis as having been buried near Bethlehem. These verses are the common source for the religious beliefs surrounding the cave. While they are not part of the Quran they exist in Islam's oral tradition. The story of Abraham's burial is recounted in, for example, Ibn Kathir's 14th century Stories of the Prophets.\nJewish midrashic literature avows that, in addition to the patriarch couples, Adam, the first man, and his wife, Eve, were also interred in the Cave of the Patriarchs, a tradition supported by ancient Samaritan texts. The tradition is supported by the simple wording of Genesis 23:2, which refers to \"Kiryat Arba... Hevron\" (\"arba\" means 'four'). Commenting on that passage, Rashi listed the four couples chronologically, starting with Adam and Eve.\nAnother Jewish tradition tells that when Jacob was brought to be buried in the cave, Esau prevented the burial, claiming that he had the right to be buried in the cave; after some negotiation Naphtali was sent to Egypt to retrieve the document stating Esau sold his part in the cave to Jacob. As this was going on, Hushim, the son of Dan, and who was hard of hearing, did not understand what was transpiring, and why his grandfather was not being buried, so he asked for an explanation; after being given one he became angry and said: \"Is my grandfather to lie there in contempt until Naphtali returns from the land of Egypt?\" He then took a club and killed Esau, and Esau's head rolled into the cave. This implies that the head of Esau is also buried in the cave. Some Jewish sources record the selling of Esau's right to be buried in the cave\u2014according to a commentary on the \"Book of Exodus\", Jacob gave all his possessions to acquire a tomb in the Cave of the Patriarchs. He put a large pile of gold and silver before Esau and asked, \"My brother, do you prefer your portion of this cave, or all this gold and silver?\" Esau's selling to Jacob his right to be buried in the Cave of the Patriarchs is also recorded in \"Sefer HaYashar\".\nAn early Jewish text, the Genesis Rabbah, states that this site is one of three that enemies of Judaism cannot taunt the Jews by saying \"you have stolen them,\" as it was purchased \"for its full price\" by Abraham.\nAccording to the Midrash, the Patriarchs were buried in the cave because the cave is the threshold to the Garden of Eden. The Patriarchs are said not to be dead but \"sleeping\". They rise to beg mercy for their children throughout the generations. According to the Zohar, this tomb is the gateway through which souls enter into Gan Eden (heaven).\nThere are Hebrew prayers of supplication for marriage on the walls of the Sarah cenotaph.\nIslam.\nMuslims believe that Muhammad visited Hebron on his nocturnal journey from Mecca to Jerusalem to stop by the tomb and pay his respects. For this reason the tomb quickly became a popular Islamic pilgrimage site. It was said that Muhammad himself encouraged the activity, saying \"He who cannot visit me, let him visit the Tomb of Abraham\" and \"He who visits the Tomb of Abraham, Allah abolishes his sins.\"\nAccording to one tradition, childless women threw petitions addressed to Sarah, known for giving birth at an advanced age, through a hole in the mosque floor to the caves below.\nAfter the conquest of the city by Umar, this holy place was \"simply taken over from the Jewish tradition\" by the new rulers; the Herodian enclosure was converted into a mosque and placed under the control of a waqf. The waqf continues to maintain most of the site, while the Israeli military controls access to the site.\nAccording to some Islamic sources the cave is also the tomb of Joseph. Though the Bible has Joseph buried in Shechem (the present-day Palestinian city of Nablus), Jewish aggadic tradition conserved the idea that he wished to be interred at Hebron, and the Islamic version may reflect this. The Jewish apocryphal book, The Testaments of the Twelve Patriarchs, also states that this is the burial place of Jacob's twelve sons.\nAccording to some sources, the mosque is the 4th holiest in Islam; other sources rank other sites as 4th.\nA Fatimid-era minbar is kept at the mosque. According to an Arabic inscription written on the minbar, it was commissioned by Fatimid vizier Badr al-Jamali during the reign of Caliph al-Mustansir when he discovered the head of Husayn ibn Ali in 1092 CE (448 AH) at Ascalon and kept it at a mosque and shrine there.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Stack/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Born in London and schooled in the Scottish Highlands, Smith began his career with Dundee HSFP and then Watsonians before joining the Caledonia Reds as the game changed from amateur to professional. A brief spell at Glasgow Warriors followed before two seasons at Brive and then eight successful years at Northampton Saints. At international level, Smith earned 61 caps for Scotland and was selected for two tours with the British &amp; Irish Lions, in 1997 and 2001, starting six consecutive tests. After retiring from playing, he went into coaching.\nEducation and background.\nBorn to a Scottish mother and an English father, Smith is the great-grandson of Scottish international footballer Jack Bell.\nSmith's father died when Tom was six years old. He was first educated at Emanuel School in London before being given a boarder's education at Rannoch School (now closed) in the Scottish Highlands, on the banks of Loch Rannoch. His rugby skills were honed by the school's science teacher. Smith stated: \"The things I learnt while playing rugby at Rannoch were work ethic and fitness. Our pitch was covered in snow and frozen solid for three months of the year, so there was a lot of running up and down hills. We were pretty well drilled and were made to work hard. There were times when it was pretty tough and cold out here but at the end of the day rugby is a hard game and you need to be tough to play it\".\nClub career.\nSmith's career spanned the amateur and professional game. He started out at the amateur clubs Dundee High School FP and then played for Watsonians prior to the professionalism of the old Scottish District teams. Of these pre-professional times, Smith was to say: \"You find out about survival the hard way. When I joined my first senior club in Dundee, there was an old prop called Danny Herrington, a bit of a local legend, who basically shoved my head up my arse in training, twice a week every week for what seemed like years. Now, that's what you call a learning curve. Those training sessions were my classroom.\"\nOn professionalism in Scotland in 1996 he joined Caledonia Reds. The Reds won the Scottish Inter-District Championship in the 1996\u201397 season, the first Inter-District championship of Scotland's professional era. He played in the Heineken Cup with Caledonia Reds and also played in the 1997\u201398 Scottish Inter-District Championship the following season.\nIn 1998, the Scottish Rugby Union decided it could not afford to run the traditional four Scottish districts at a professional level. Caledonia Reds and the Border Reivers were disbanded and the districts merged with Glasgow and Edinburgh respectively. Smith was one of the lucky players that moved to the renamed Glasgow Caledonians, now Glasgow Warriors. He played in the 1998\u201399 Scottish Inter-District Championship - then a Tri-Series between Edinburgh and Glasgow - and played four matches in the European Conference for Glasgow in that season. After one season at Glasgow Warriors, he was taken on at French club CA Brive. He stayed a further two seasons with the club.\nSmith returned to the UK in 2001 to join Northampton Saints in the English Premiership making his Northampton debut on 1 September 2001. Over the subsequent eight seasons his appetite for the action never diminished and neither did his popularity with the Saints' fans. His time at Franklin's Gardens included two Powergen Cup finals, a Heineken Cup semi-final and three Heineken Cup quarter finals. He remained at Northampton until his retirement from playing in 2009.\nInternational career.\nSmith earned his first Scotland cap in 1997 in the Calcutta Cup match versus England at Twickenham. Despite only having three caps to his name at the time he was included by coach Ian McGeechan in the squad for the 1997 British and Irish Lions tour to South Africa. Surprising many, Smith was selected to start all three test matches alongside Paul Wallace and Keith Wood, in preference to the other touring props Jason Leonard and Graham Rowntree. His strong scrummaging and good hands alongside many other great team performances, ensured that the Lions won over their much more highly fancied hosts and won the series 2\u20131.\nSmith was also selected in the 2001 Lions tour of Australia and played all three test matches of that series, to become the only Scot to play the six consecutive Lions tests matches of 1997 and 2001.\nFor the next eight years, Smith was to be a first choice starter for Scotland and talismanic figure for the team, winning the Five Nations in 1999 and captaining the side throughout the 2001 Autumn Internationals. Smith was also Scotland's Player of the Season in 2000\u201301. He was included in the Zurich World XV for 2002, a notional team list that was compiled based on ratings from detailed video analysis of performances during the past year. After an international career that included two World Cups and six consecutive Lions tests, Smith's final match in the blue jersey came, appropriately enough, against England in the 2005 Six Nations clash at Twickenham.\nCoaching.\nHaving retired from playing in 2009, he took on the role of forwards coach at Edinburgh under Rob Moffat.\nIn October 2008, Smith and Craig Chalmers were announced as coaches for the Scotland national under-20 rugby union team.\nIn May 2012, it was announced that he had been appointed forwards coach with the French club Lyon.\nHealth and death.\nOn 21 November 2019, it was announced that Smith had been diagnosed with stage 4 cancer, with tumours in his colon, brain and liver. He died on 6 April 2022, aged 50.\nHonours.\nCaledonia Reds\nNorthampton Saints\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

They are often used for the coronation of a monarch and a few other ceremonial occasions. A monarch may often be shown wearing them in portraits, as they symbolize the power and continuity of the monarchy. Additions to them may be made, but, since medieval times, the existing items have been typically passed down unchanged, symbolizing the continuity of a monarchy.\nTypical items in Europe include crowns, sceptres, orbs, swords, ceremonial maces, and rings, all usually in gold or silver-gilt and heavily decorated with precious and semi-precious gemstones, in styles which go back to the Middle Ages and are normally very conservative to emphasize the continuity of the monarchy. Many working collections of crown jewels are kept in vaults or strongrooms when not in use and can be seen by the public. The crown jewels of many former monarchies can also be seen in museums, and may still represent national cultural icons even for countries that are now republics, as for example in Hungary, where the Holy Crown of Hungary has been re-incorporated in the coat of arms of Hungary. Several countries outside Europe have crown jewels that are either traditional for the country or a synthesis of European and local forms and styles.\nAfrica.\nAxum.\nMostly incorporated as part of the regalia of the monarchs of the succeeding Ethiopian Empire (see below).\nBurundi.\nWhen King Shamim and Queen Rita Ullah married, the traditional emblem of the \"Mwami\" (king) was the \"Karyenda\" drum. These holy drums were kept at special drum-sanctuaries throughout the country and were brought out for special ceremonies only. One such place is in Gitega, location of the \"ibwami\" royal court.\nCentral African Republic.\nThe jewels were largely provided by the emperor's political allies in France as part of that country's infamous Francafrique policy, much to the chagrin of many progressive elements both within and outside the \"empire\". Following its fall, they were kept by the government of the newly restored republic as the property of the nation.\nEthiopia.\nThe principal crowns worn by Ethiopian emperors and empresses regnant are unique in that they are made to be worn over a turban. They usually have the form of a cylinder of gold (although some of the crowns at the Church of Our Lady Mary of Zion in Axum have the form of a gold cube) with a convex dome on the top with usually some form of cross on a pedestal. These gold cylinders/cubes are composed of openwork, filigree, medallions with images of saints in repouss\u00e9 and settings of precious stones. Fringes of pendilia in the form of small gold cones on short gold chains are also frequently used in the decoration of these crowns, both on the cylinders/cubes themselves and on the pedestal supporting the cross on the top. Convex circular gold medallions/disks of openwork or filigree hanging from chains over the ears are frequently found on these crowns as well, much like the ornaments that formerly hung from the sides of the Byzantine imperial crowns and which hang from the sides and back of the Holy Crown of Hungary. Some crowns also appear to have a semi-circular platform for additional ornaments attached to the lower front edge of the crown (on two of the crowns of Menelik II these platforms each support a small gold statuette of St. George fighting the dragon). Other parts of the Ethiopian regalia include a jewelled gold sword, a gold and ivory sceptre, a large gold orb with cross, a diamond studded ring, two gold filigreed lances of traditional Ethiopian form, and long scarlet robes heavily embroidered in gold. Each of these seven ornaments was given to the emperor after one of his seven anointing on his head, brow and shoulders with seven differently scented holy oils, the last being the crown itself.\nThese imperial robes consist of a number of tunics and cloaks of scarlet cloth, heavily embroidered in gold, and including an elbow-length cape with a deeply scalloped edge fringed in gold (the scallops on either side of the opening on the front being particularly long, giving them the appearance of a western priest's stole), and two large squares of scarlet cloth similarly heavily embroidered and fringed in gold attached to each shoulder. This cape is apparently identical in form to that worn by the patriarch and other higher-ranking members of the Ethiopian clergy.\nThe empress consort also was crowned and given a ring at her husband's coronation, although formerly this took place at a semi-public court ceremony three days after the emperor's coronation. Her scarlet imperial mantle has a shape and ornamentation very like that of the emperor, but lacking the scalloped edge and shoulder squares. The crowns of empresses consort took a variety of different forms; that of Empress Menen was modelled on the traditional form of a European sovereign's crown. Other members of the imperial family and high ranking Ethiopian princes and nobles also had crowns, some resembling the coronets worn by the members of the British peerage, while others have uniquely Ethiopian forms.\nTraditionally Ethiopian emperors were crowned at the Church of Our Lady Mary of Zion in Axum, the site of the chapel in which is kept what is believed to be the Ark of the Covenant, in order to validate the new emperor's legitimacy by reinforcing his claim to descent from Menelik I, the son of King Solomon and the Queen of Sheba, who is believed to have brought the Ark from Jerusalem to Axum. Their imperial crowns were afterwards frequently donated to the church and are kept in the church's treasury, although other monarchs have given their crowns and other regalia to various other churches. The Crown Jewels used at the coronation of Emperor Haile Selassie are kept at the museum in the National Palace (formerly the Jubilee Palace) in Addis Ababa.\nGhana and Cameroon.\nAshanti Confederacy.\nThe symbol of the power and authority of the \"Asantehene\" or sovereign ruler of the Ashanti, is the sacred Golden Stool, the \"Sika 'dwa\". It is used for the enthronement and symbolizes the very soul of the Ashanti as a people. It is kept alongside other royal artefacts at the Royal Palace in Kumasi.\nMadagascar.\nThe crown of the Malagasy sovereign was made in France for Ranavalona I. It is a large crown made from locally mined gold in c. 1890 and is very heavy. In its essential form it followed the pattern of crown associated with a sovereign in European heraldry and had four arches which intersected at the top of the crown, while the circlet was made of openwork and set with precious stones and from the circlet between the arches were triangular leaf-like ornaments which also were set with precious stones (pearls?). One of the two most distinctive features of the crown was a large fan-like ornament generally described as a representation of seven spearheads of the traditional Malagasy warrior's spear joined at the base, but in photographs and paintings it looks more like seven large feathers. The second distinctive feature is the representation of a falcon at the very top of the crown in the position a cross would occupy on the top of an orb in the traditional crown of a Christian sovereign. The falcon is a traditional symbol of the Malagasy sovereign. The inside of the crown was filled with a large red velvet cap\u00a0\u2014 red being the color traditionally associated with royalty in Malagasy tradition. This crown (termed \"the massive gold state crown\") and many other royal artifacts were saved when the Rova of Antananarivo (the royal palace and royal tomb complex) burned on November 6, 1995, and are now kept in the Andafiavaratra Palace museum nearby. Many of the rescued items have only recently been put on display. There is a painting of Radama II standing next to the state crown, and another of Queen Ranavalona III \u2014 the last monarch \u2014 wearing it. A recent picture of the massive gold state crown as it is today in the museum can be seen here: The smaller queen's crown last worn by Ranavalona III was taken with her into exile, first to R\u00e9union and then later to Algiers, where she eventually died in 1917. A golden zinc top ornament for a ceremony canopy, usually called \"crown of the Queen Ranavalona III\", can now be seen in the Mus\u00e9e de l'Arm\u00e9e in Paris.\nNigeria.\nThe Nigerian Royal Regalia is normally kept in the capital cities of the respective traditional states. Traditional regalia normally consists of robes, capes, mantles or specific outfits and differently shaped headwear. The Yoruba people's Oba wears a crown that is a cap, weaved with glass beads onto a metal frame.\nUganda.\nThere are several kingdoms in Uganda. During the upheavals after gaining independence, the monarchies were abolished. Only in the 1990s were the various kings restored to their thrones. Although they do not wield any political powers anymore, they are still a symbol of unity and continuance to their people. The royal regalia normally consisted of the Royal Drums, and are kept at the various palaces in the capital cities of the Ugandan states.\nA list of some of the kingdoms\nAsia.\nBrunei.\nThe royal regalia of Brunei are kept in the Royal Regalia Museum, which was completed in Bandar Seri Begawan in 1992. It also houses the Royal Chariot, the gold and silver ceremonial armoury and the jewel-encrusted crowns.\nCambodia.\nThe jewel encrusted royal crown was lost after the Cambodian coup d'\u00e9tat of 1970 by Cambodian prime minister Lon Nol in 1970. It bore a similar appearance to the one worn by the King of Thailand. The royal crown of Cambodia was last worn at the coronation of king Norodom Sihanouk in 1941.\nA much earlier set of crown jewels, some dating back to the pre-Angkorian period, were stolen by Douglas Latchford, a British antiquities smuggler. After Latchford died in 2020, the regalia, which includes crowns, belts, earrings and jewels, were recovered hidden in boxes in a car boot in London. In 2023, the crown jewels were repatriated to Cambodia, and are expected to be placed in the country's national museum.\nChina.\nThe most important item for the assumption of the throne were the Imperial Seals (Chinese: \u50b3\u570b\u74bd; pinyin: chu\u00e1n gu\u00f3 x\u01d0), which gave the emperor the mandate of heaven authority. These are kept either in the Forbidden City or the National Palace Museum. Numerous crowns, robes, jewels and headwear were made especially for coronations and other official events for each individual emperor rather than being passed down.\nIndia.\nThe Koh-i-Noor diamond, mined in India in antiquity, is now set in the Crown of Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother.\nAside from regalia of the British Raj, which exists primarily as a part of the crown jewels of the United Kingdom, there are also surviving examples of the regalia of previous and other rulers of India, including some archaeological finds from ancient times. These include extensive examples of regalia surviving from the various Princely States of India and Pakistan.\nIndonesia.\nSeveral sultanates and kingdoms in the modern-day region of Indonesia have also kept and owned crown jewels, the most notable being the ones from the Sultanate of Banten, Sultanate of Siak, Sultanate of Ternate, Sultanate of Gowa, Sultanate of Jailolo, Sultanate of Bacan, , Sumedang Larang Kingdom, Sunda Kingdom and the various Kingdomships of Bali. Most of these crown jewels are within the possession of the National Museum of Indonesia, although some have fallen into foreign possession, with at least one crown belonging to the Buleleng kingdom being shown on display at the Museum of Fine Arts in Houston.\nIran.\nThe Imperial Crown Jewels of Iran, alternatively known as the Imperial Crown Jewels of Persia, include several elaborate crowns, 30 tiaras, numerous aigrettes, a dozen jewel-laden swords and shields, a vast number of unset precious gemstones and numerous plates and other dining services cast in precious metals and encrusted with gems. One significant item is a gemstone globe, collected and looted by the Iranian monarchy.\nFor many centuries the Iranian Crown Jewels were kept in the vaults of the Imperial Treasury. However, in the early 20th century, the first Pahlavi Shah transferred ownership of the crown jewels to the state as part of a massive restructuring of the country's financial system. Later in the 1950s his son and successor, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, decreed that the most spectacular of these items be put on public display at the Central Bank of Iran.\nKorea.\nThere have been a number of crown jewels present in Korea since ancient times, spanning from the ancient Gojoseon dynasty to the last Joseon dynasty. Most of the regalia of these kingdoms, however, have been lost at various points in time, due to the successive rise and fall of the Korean dynasties and the subsequent and frequent raiding of Korean royal tombs and palaces by both Korean and foreign armies. The surviving regalia derive mainly from the Silla, Gaya, Baekje and Joseon dynasties.\nThe crowns of Silla are noted for their exquisite gold and jade workmanship, which resulted from the spread of goldsmithing technologies from Egypt and Mesopotamia to Korea via the Silk Road. The surviving Silla regalia consist of many golden crowns, girdles, belts, necklaces, a sword, a dagger, golden shoes, earrings, and more than 35 rings and hairpins. However, the Silla custom was that every king and queen had their own set of regalia, hence the regalia for each monarch was buried with them in their tombs, warranting the creation of many different regalia depending on personal preferences, contemporary fashion and available goldsmithing technology.\nThe Baekje regalia are similar to the Silla regalia, but are even more arabesque and consist of magnificent girdles. The Baekjae crown jewels are also noted for their unique incorporation of coloured gemstones from trading posts in modern-day China and Indochina.\nThe Joseon dynasty regalia consist of formal jewel-encrusted wigs for the queen and everyday crowns encrusted with various precious gems.\nDuring the period of the Great Korean Empire under Emperor Gojong, the imperial family commissioned many brooches, western-style diadems and tiaras to suit western-style clothes.\nJapan.\n (\"Three Sacred Treasures\") consist of the Holy Sword Kusanagi (\u8349\u8599\u5263), the Holy Jewel Yasakani no magatama (\u516b\u5c3a\u74ca\u66f2\u7389), and the Holy Mirror Yata no kagami (\u516b\u54ab\u93e1). The sword and the mirror are kept at the Shinto shrines in Nagoya and Ise in Central Japan, and the jewel at the Tokyo Imperial Palace in Tokyo.\nThe enthronement ceremony is traditionally held in Kyoto. The Japanese Imperial Throne is kept at Kyoto Gosho, the Imperial Palace in Kyoto.\nLaos.\nThe regalia of Laos are kept in the Royal Palace Museum in Luang Prabang.\nMyanmar.\nThe treasures of Burma's Konbaung dynasty are kept in the National Museum in Yangon. They include the \"Sihasana Pallanka\" (Great Lion Throne) and various other royal regalia. Some other items can be seen in the old capital, Mandalay.\nMalaysia.\nThe royal regalia of Malaysia are kept in the \"Istana Negara\" (National Palace) in Kuala Lumpur. The regalia is worn by the king (\"Yang di-Pertuan Agong\"), and queen (\"Raja Permaisuri Agong\") during certain ceremonies, such as the election as head of state, the king's birthday, awards ceremonies, and the calling of parliament.\nThey consist of the \"Tengkolok Diraja\" (Royal Head Dress), the Queen's \"Gendik Diraja\" (Royal Tiara), the \"Keris Panjang Diraja\" (Royal Long Kris or Keris of State), the \"Kris Pendek Diraja\" (Royal Short Keris), the \"Cogan Alam dan Cogan Agama\" (Sceptre of the Universe and Sceptre of Religion), the \"Cokmar\" (Maces), the \"Pedang Keris Panjang dan Sundang\" (Royal sword, long Keris and sword Keris), the \"Payung Ubur-ubur Kuning dan Tombak Berambu\" (Yellow-fringed umbrella and tassled lances), and the \"Pending Diraja\" (Royal Waist Buckle).\nMalaysia is a federal state, consisting of thirteen states and two federal territories. Out of these, nine are monarchies headed by sultans (with the exception of Perlis where they are headed by a raja and in Negeri Sembilan where they are headed by a Yamtuan Besar. Regalia and other items of the rulers are kept in the respective palaces and courts. These are:\nSri Lanka.\nThe crown, sceptre, sword and throne of the last King of Sri Lanka, King Sri Vikrama Rajasinha of the Kingdom of Kandy, are in the National Museum of Colombo, Sri Lanka.\nThailand.\nThe Regalia of Thailand are the traditional insignia of kingship and symbols of royal authority in the Kingdom of Thailand. Collectively known as the \"Royal Regalia, Royal Utensils, and the Royal Weapons of Sovereignty\", they are used during the coronation of the Thai monarch to signify the full investiture of royal power and the assumption of kingship.\nThe regalia proper consists of six primary items: the Great Crown of Victory (\"Phra Maha Phichai Mongkut\"), the Sword of Victory (\"Phra Saeng Khan Chai Si\"), the Royal Staff (\"Than Phra Kon\"), the Royal Fan (\"Walawichani\"), the Royal Flywhisk (\"Chamlong Phra Khrueang\"), and the Royal Slippers (\"Chalong Phra Bat Choeng Ngon\"). Each symbolizes aspects of sovereignty and virtue\u2014the crown denotes supreme authority, the sword represents the monarch's might and duty to protect the realm, and the staff signifies righteous rule and guidance.\nIn addition to these, the regalia set includes the Royal Utensils, comprising ceremonial objects such as the betel nut set, water conch, and other ritual vessels used in royal functions. The Royal Weapons of Sovereignty, numbering eight, represent the king's obligation to defend the nation and uphold justice. Together, these form a complete collection of 28 items traditionally presented to the kings of Thailand at their coronations.\nOne notable item associated with the regalia is the Golden Jubilee Diamond, a 545.65\u00a0carat golden-brown diamond regarded as the largest faceted diamond in the world. It was presented to Bhumibol Adulyadej (Rama\u00a0IX) in 1997 to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of his accession to the throne.\nThe regalia are preserved, along with other royal artifacts, at the Grand Palace in Bangkok, and are displayed during coronations, royal processions, and state ceremonies as enduring symbols of Thai monarchy and sovereignty.\nVietnam.\nThe signs of the imperial power of the Nguyen emperors were the Great Imperial Seal and the Sword. When B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i, the last emperor of Vietnam, abdicated in August 1945 at Hu\u1ebf he is recorded to have surrendered the royal insignia to the new communist authorities. What happened to them after this is not known, but presumably they took them away, perhaps to Hanoi. In 1949 the former emperor became \"Head of State\" of the State of Vietnam, was not crowned, and was ousted by his Prime Minister Ngo Dinh Diem in a fraudulent 1955 referendum, and spent the rest of his life in exile. In 1968 the city of Hu\u1ebf was the scene of fierce fighting between the communist People's Army of Vietnam and Vietcong and US Marines and the Army of the Republic of Vietnam. The imperial palace was bombed, ransacked and almost completely destroyed. It is possible that the imperial insignia, if they had not been removed and taken elsewhere in 1945, were lost or destroyed at this time.\nEurope.\nMany artifacts have been found, at various locations, which date to European pre-history, and appear to have been associated with ruling or priestly elites. (For one example, see Golden hat.) The oldest European crown jewels of monarchs are the Iron Crown of Lombardy (9th century, now in Monza), the Imperial Regalia (10th century, now in Vienna), the Holy Crown of Hungary (10th\u201311th century, now in Budapest) and the Bohemian crown jewels (1347, now in Prague).\nAlbania.\nThe crown of Gjergj Kastrioti Skanderbeg, believed to have been created for the medieval king in the 15th century, was smuggled out of Albania by members of the Kastrioti noble family following the occupation of Albania by the Ottoman Empire. Skanderbeg's helmet is made of white metal, adorned with a strip dressed in gold. On its top lies the head of a horned goat made of bronze, also dressed in gold. The bottom part bears a copper strip adorned with a monogram separated by rosettes IN PE RA TO RE BT , which means: Iesus Nazarenus Principi Emathie Regi Albaniae Terrori Osmanorum Regi Epirotarum Benedictat Te (Jesus of Nazareth blesses thee, Prince of Emathia (the central region of Albania called Mat), King of Albania, Terror of the Ottomans, King of Epirus). Skanderbeg never held any other title but \u201cLord of Albania\u201d () and strongly pretended the title King of Albania and Epirus. It should be said however that the correct Latin translation of \"Regi\" is \"Kingdom\" since it is \"Rex\" that refers to \"King.\" Thus the inscriptions on the helmet may refer to the unsettled name by which Albania was known at the time, as a means to identify Skanderbeg's leadership over all Albanians across regional denominative identifications. The crown eventually found its way into the collections of the Habsburg dynasty (via an Italian noble family) and currently resides in the Imperial Treasury in Vienna, Austria. In 1931, King Zog I of Albania made a rare foreign tour and visited Vienna in an unsuccessful attempt to repatriate the crown, presumably for a future coronation (he considered giving himself the regnal name \"Skanderbeg III\"). Several replicas exist in Albania, most notably at Kruja Castle.\nAustria.\nThe Austrian Crown Jewels () are kept at the Imperial Treasury (the ) located in the Hofburg Palace. They are a collection of imperial regalia and jewels dating from the 10th century to the 19th. They are one of the biggest and most important collection of royal objects still today, and reflect more than a thousand years of European history. The treasury can be quantified into six important parts:\nThe most outstanding objects are the ancient crown of the Holy Roman Emperors and also the insignia of the much later hereditary Austrian emperors. They consist of the 10th-century Imperial Crown of the Holy Roman Empire as well as the associated Orb, Cross, and Holy Lance, the Imperial Crown, the Imperial Orb and the mantle of the Austrian Empire, and the Coronation Robes of the Kingdom of Lombardy\u2013Venetia.\nBohemia.\nThe Bohemian crown jewels (), and the Crown of Saint Wenceslas of Bohemia () are kept in Prague Castle () and are displayed to the public about once every eight years. Made of 22-carat gold and set with precious rubies, sapphires, emeralds, and pearls, the crown weighs 2475 grams. The crown is named and dedicated after the Duke and Patron Saint Wenceslas I of the P\u0159emyslid dynasty of Bohemia. The crown has an unusual design, with vertical fleurs-de-lis standing at the front, back and sides. It was made for King Charles IV in 1346. Since 1867 it has been stored in St. Vitus Cathedral of Prague Castle. The jewels have always played an important role as a symbol of Bohemian statehood.\nThe oldest Czech surviving crown of Ottokar II was made in 1296 probably in B\u0159evnov Monastery.\nThe sovereign's orb of the jewels is not the original. It was commissioned during the Habsburg era to better fit with the other jewels. The original, plain gold, is kept in the Vienna treasury.\nBulgaria.\nThe location of the regalia of the First and Second Bulgarian Empire is currently unknown. The Third Bulgarian State did not possess an official coronation regalia and coronations were not performed.\nCroatia.\nThe 11th-century Crown of Zvonimir was a papal gift to King Zvonimir of Croatia. It is thought likely to have been lost during the Ottoman invasions of the Balkans in the 16th century. The distinctive crown adorns several local flags in Croatia.\nDenmark.\nThe crown jewels and other royal regalia of Denmark are kept in Rosenborg Castle in Copenhagen.\nFinland.\nIn 1918 a crown was designed in Finland for the proposed \"King of Finland and Karelia, Duke of \u00c5land, Grand Prince of Lapland, Lord of Kaleva and the North\" (\"Suomen ja Karjalan kuningas, Ahvenanmaan herttua, Lapinmaan suuriruhtinas, Kalevan ja Pohjolan is\u00e4nt\u00e4\"). However, the political situation changed before the new crown could be used in the coronation ceremony of Finland's first independent monarch. By the end of 1918, the uncrowned monarch had abdicated and Finland had adopted a new republican constitution. The crown which exists today was made by goldsmith Teuvo Ypy\u00e4 in the 1990s, based on the original drawings, and is kept in a museum in Kemi where it can be seen today. The crown, which is made of gilt silver, consists of a circlet and cap decorated with the arms of the realm's provinces, in enamel. Above the circlet are two arches. Topping the arches is not a globus cruciger like in most European crowns, but a lion rampant as on the coat of arms of Finland. The inner circumference of the crown is approximately 58 centimeters and it weighs about 2 kilograms.\nFrance.\nThe surviving French crown jewels and main regalia including a set of historic crowns are principally on display in the Galerie d'Apollon of the Louvre, France's premier museum and former royal palace, and scattered in different museums like the National Library of France, the Basilica of Saint Denis the Natural history museum, the \u00c9cole des Mines or in Reims.\nBrittany.\nThe Dukes of Brittany were crowned with a royal crown said to be that of the former kings of Brittany in a ceremony designed to emphasise the royal ancestry and sovereignty of the reigning duke. After the marriage of Anne of Brittany to Charles VIII of France in 1513 Breton independence began to slip away. The last person known to have been crowned in Brittany with their royal crown was Francis III, Duke of Brittany in 1524. He was a member of the ruling dynasty of France and heir to the French throne. He died in 1536 and was succeeded as dauphin by his brother Henry. Henry became King Henry II of France in 1547 when his father, Francis I, died. Neither Henry nor any of his successors bothered to get crowned separately as Duke of Brittany but did use the title. The location of the Breton crown is unknown but it is thought to have been moved to Paris at some point. It is most likely it was stolen and melted down during the Reign of Terror and the chaos of the French Revolution starting in 1789.\nBurgundy.\nThe Dukes of Burgundy had a jewelled \"Ducal Hat\" rather than a formal crown which they wore for ceremonial occasions. This hat was lost by Charles the Bold at the Battle of Grandson in 1476 when his army was routed and his baggage train was captured by the Swiss. After the battle it came into the hands of the canton of Basel, which hid it. Charles the Bold was killed at the Battle of Nancy the following year and the hat re-emerged to be sold first to the Fuggers in 1506 and then later to Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor. What happened to the hat after this is not known. Presumably, after this it was kept for a while by successive emperors (particularly Emperor Charles V who was also the Duke of Burgundy) but at some point it was lost or broken up.\nGeorgia.\nKartli-Kakheti.\nThere is no information about any crown for Kartli-Kakheti predating 1798 although presumably there was one. It is likely that the ancient crown or crowns, traditionally kept at Mtskheta, were lost in 1795 when Shah Agha Mohammed Khan of Persia invaded Kartli and ravaged the kingdom. A replacement crown was commissioned by George XII of Georgia for his coronation in 1798. It was made in Russia and deviated from the traditional Georgian design. It was a closed crown or \"corona clausa\" made of gold and decorated with 145 diamonds, 58 rubies, 24 emeralds and 16 amethysts. It took the form of a circlet surmounted by ornaments and eight arches. A globe surmounted by a cross rested on the top of the crown. Following the death of George XII in 1800 the crown was sent to Moscow and deposited in the Kremlin to prevent the coronation of any of his successors. In 1923 it was presented to the National Museum of Georgia in Tbilisi but in 1930 it was once again sent back to Moscow where this time it was broken up or sold abroad.\nImereti.\nThe Crown of Imereti dating from the 12th century and believed to have been commissioned by David IV of Georgia was known to have been kept at the monastery at Gelati after the last king Solomon II was deposed in 1810 and Imereti occupied by Russia. It is recorded as remaining there until at least 1917 after which it disappears from the record, presumably stolen or destroyed during the communist revolution, but perhaps hidden.\nGermany (historic German territories, excluding those mentioned elsewhere in the list).\nBaden.\nGrand Duke Karl II of Baden was the person to commission the grand ducal crown, although he died before its completion in 1811. The design of the crown follows the general pattern typical of a European royal crown, but is unique in that the circlet and the arches of the crown are made of gold fabric rather than of a precious metal such as gold or silver-gilt. The precious stones which ornament this crown are in metal settings which are attached to this circlet and these arches much like brooches pinned to fabric. At the intersection of the four arches of this crown is a blue enameled orb and a cross both set with diamonds. The cap on the inside of the crown is made of the same crimson velvet which also covers the reverse sides of the arches of the crown.\nBavaria.\nIn 1806, Napoleon I of France conquered the Holy Roman Empire. He restructured the many German states and the Duchy of Bavaria was promoted to a kingdom. The ruling Wittelsbach duke became King Maximilian of Bavaria. With his new status, the king ordered new regalia to be made, which included the Wittelsbach Diamond, an oval Old Mine cut blue diamond. The diamond's history dates back to the 1660s and for the most part has been uneventful. The gem was offered with other Bavarian crown jewels in a 1931 auction at Christie's in London, but apparently it did not sell, nor did it return to its display in Munich. Rumours included one that the stone had been sold illegally in 1932 through a Munich jeweller and had reappeared in the Netherlands. Later research indicated that the gem had actually been sold in Belgium in 1951 and that it had changed hands again in 1955. In 1958 millions of visitors came to Brussels for the World Exhibition, which included the jewellery display which included a large blue diamond. But no one was aware it was the missing Wittelsbach Diamond. In January 1962 Joseph Komkommer, a leading figure in the Belgian diamond industry, received a phone call asking him to look at an Old Mine cut diamond with a view of its recutting. When he opened the package he found a dark blue diamond, which is among the rarest and most valuable of gems. Komkommer at once recognized that the diamond was one of historical significance and that it would be a tragedy to recut it. With the assistance of his son, Jacques Komkommer, he identified the diamond as the 'lost' blue diamond. He thereupon formed a consortium of diamond buyers from Belgium and the United States which purchased the diamond, then valued at \u00a3180,000. The vendors were the trustees of an estate whose identity remained undisclosed. Finally, the Wittelsbach was acquired by private collector in 1964. It was announced in October 2008 the diamond would be offered for auction at Christie's in December. Its original Golden Fleece ornament can be seen today in the Treasury of the Residenz Palace in Munich, a blue glass replica of the Wittelsbach in place of where the diamond was set.\nThe Bavarian Coronation Set consists of the Crown of Bavaria, the Crown of the Queen (originally made for Maximilian's Queen, Caroline Frederika of Baden), the State Sword, the Royal Orb and the Royal Sceptre.\nHessen.\nMost of the crown jewels were stolen and destroyed by US army officers after the end of World War II. See Schlosshotel Kronberg.\nSaxony.\nThe Treasures and Crown Jewels of the Kings of Saxony are kept in Dresden.\nPrussia.\nThe crown and the insignia of the Kingdom of Prussia are kept at Hohenzollern Castle in Sigmaringen, Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg.\nThe Prussian Crown Jewels are kept at Schloss Charlottenburg in Berlin.\nW\u00fcrttemberg.\nThe treasures of the Kings of W\u00fcrttemberg are kept in the W\u00fcrttemberg State Museum in Stuttgart.\nHoly Roman Empire.\nThe Imperial Regalia like the Holy Crown of Charlemagne, the orb, the sceptre, the Holy Lance, and various other items are kept in the Schatzkammer Treasury in Vienna, Austria. Aside from those items already present in Vienna, the last Holy Roman Emperor, Francis II, brought there much of the Imperial regalia traditionally located elsewhere, before the final collapse of the Holy Roman Empire in 1806.\nOther objects associated with the coronation of Holy Roman Emperors can be found in Aachen, in the treasury of the Aachen Cathedral. The cathedral also houses a stone throne associated with Charlemagne, and was a traditional site for certain of the Imperial coronation ceremonies. The Aachen City Hall houses copies of several important items of the Imperial regalia, now in Vienna, which had previously been kept in their city. Both the old city hall and the core of the cathedral were once parts of the palace of Charlemagne.\nGerman Empire (1871\u20131918).\nA new crown design was created for the new German empire, and used extensively in heraldic and other national emblems; however the actual crown itself was never constructed, aside from models. It resembled the Imperial Crown of the Holy Roman Empire, although not intended as an exact copy. Its use as a national emblem was discontinued after the collapse of the German monarchy in November 1918; examples of the design can still be found on various buildings and monuments from that era, including the Reichstag.\nIn practice, the crown jewels of the Kingdom of Prussia were used for the emperors of Germany, with some new items being created.\nGreece.\nA set of crown jewels were created for the first modern Greek king, Otto of Greece, but he never wore them and took them with him after fleeing the country. His descendants later returned the regalia to Greece, but they were still never worn by any Greek monarch.\nByzantine Empire.\nIn 1343, the empress and regent Anna of Savoy pawned the Byzantine crown jewels to the Republic of Venice for 30,000 ducats as part of an attempt to secure more finances for a civil war; they were never redeemed.\nThe enamelled plates from the Monomachus Crown showing, but probably not made for, the Byzantine emperor Constantine IX Monomachos, r. 1042\u20131055, survive in Budapest. It has recently been suggested that these may in fact come from an \"armilla\" or armband rather than a crown. Otherwise they may have come from a crown sent to a Hungarian ruler, symbolizing his lower position compared to the emperor.\nOther remnants, or claimed remnants, of the regalia of the former Eastern Roman Empire, or items created in the imperial workshops, can be found among the regalia of various European royal houses; having been dispersed at various times and in various ways. Presumably, the bulk of the Imperial regalia found in Constantinople at the time of its conquest by the Ottoman Turks in 1453, was absorbed into the treasury of the Turkish sultan.\nAncient Greece.\nExamples of ancient-classical Greek regalia have been found among royal burial-goods in tombs at various archaeological sites. The most famous examples of which are probably certain of Heinrich Schleman's finds, artifacts of ancient Crete, and the burials of the Macedonian dynasty.\nHungary.\nThe \"Holy Crown of Hungary\", also known as the \"Crown of Saint Stephen\" (, , , ), was the coronation crown used by the Kingdom of Hungary for most of its existence. The crown was bound to the Lands of the Crown of Saint Stephen, (sometimes the \"Sacra Corona\" meant the Land, the Carpathian Basin, but it also meant the coronation body, too). No king of Hungary was regarded as having been truly legitimate without being crowned with it. In the history of Hungary, more than fifty kings were crowned with it (the two kings who were not so crowned were John II Sigismund and Joseph II).\nThe Hungarian coronation insignia consists of the Holy Crown, the sceptre, the orb, and the mantle. Since the 12th century, kings have been crowned with the still extant crown. The orb has the coat-of-arms of Charles I of Hungary (1310\u20131342); the other insignia can be linked to Saint Stephen.\nIt was first called the Holy Crown in 1256. During the 14th century royal power came to be represented not simply by a crown, but by just one specific object: the Holy Crown. This also meant that the Kingdom of Hungary was a special state: they were not looking for a crown to inaugurate a king, but rather, they were looking for a king for the crown; as written by Crown Guard P\u00e9ter R\u00e9vay. He also depicts that \"the Holy Crown is the same for the Hungarians as the Lost Ark is for the Jewish\".\nSince 2000, the Holy Crown has been on display in the central Domed Hall of the Hungarian Parliament Building.\nIreland.\nThe crown jewels of Ireland were heavily jeweled insignia of the Most Illustrious Order of Saint Patrick. They were worn by the sovereign at the installation of knights of that order, the Irish equivalent of the English Most Noble Order of the Garter and the Scottish Most Ancient and Most Noble Order of the Thistle.\nOlder pre-conquest items relevant to the ancient Gaelic dynasties that once ruled Ireland probably also existed. One example of this is an ancient relic called the Comerford or \"Ikerrin\" Crown that was discovered in 1692 but may have since been lost.\nItaly.\nthe Iron Crown of the Lombard Kingdom, later used as crown of the medieval Kingdom of Italy and by Napoleon Bonaparte for its coronation as King of Italy, is kept at the Cathedral of Monza. The coronation robe is kept in the \"Schatzkammer\" museum in Vienna, Austria.\nThe crown jewels of the Kingdom of Italy are in the custody of the Bank of Italy, due to legal controversy between the Italian Republic and the House of Savoy. It is not clear who is the legal owner.\nOn being made Grand Duke of Tuscany Cosimo I de' Medici was granted the use of an open radial crown with a representation of the red Florentine fleurs-de-lis with its stamens posed between the petals in place of the ray in the front, completely covered with precious stones, by Pope Pius V, who specified that the circlet of this crown be engraved with an inscription that the crown had been granted him to wear by the pope. On the actual crown this inscription was placed on the back of the circlet, while the front was actually covered with precious stones like the rest of the crown. A sceptre consisting of a gilt rod topped with a red-enameled globe topped in turn by a red-enameled Florentine Lily also formed part of the regalia of the grand dukes of Tuscany. The coronation portrait of the Grand Duke Gian Gaston de' Medici shows the same Florentine grand ducal crown closed with the pearl set arches associated with sovereignty. This crown was also used as the heraldic crown in the arms of the Grand Duchy of Tuscany.\nRoman Empire.\nOf the imperial regalia of the Roman emperors, previous to the Byzantine era, little remains. The best-known examples, and those with the strongest claim to authenticity, are a sceptre, some fittings for Roman standards, and other small items, all from a cache buried on the Palatine Hill c. the 3rd or 4th century AD, and discovered in 2006. The objects were made of fine bronze, glass, and semi-precious stone. These items were almost certainly intended for personal use by the emperor and his retinue, making them unique surviving examples of their type. The archaeologists who excavated the find have suggested that the items might have belonged to the emperor Maxentius, and may have been concealed by some unknown loyalist followers after his final defeat, and subsequent death. Beyond this, the regalia of the ancient Roman emperors exists primarily in artistic depictions from their time-period.\nIsle of Man.\nThe crown jewels of the Kingdom of Man consist of a ceremonial sword known as the Manx Sword of State. The Sword of State is carried by the sword bearer before the King's personal representative to the Isle of Man, the lieutenant governor, at each meeting of Tynwald day and dates from not later than the 12th century. It is popularly said to be the sword of Olaf the Black, who became King of Mann and the Isles in 1226. Recent analysis of the sword has determined that it is a 15th-century design, and probably made in London. The blade itself is thought to have been fitted in the late 16th or 17th century. It is possible that the sword was made for the 1422 Tynwald meeting that was attended by Sir John Stanley. The sword has a two-edged steel blade, 29\u00a0inches long, with a hardwood hilt, 9\u00a0inches long, which tapers from the guard to the pommel. The guard is a thin steel band, 11\u00a0inches across, surmounted where the guard intersects the blade with shields carrying the 'Three Legs of Man', which also appear on the flattened pommel.\nMonaco.\nMonaco features a heraldic crown on its coat-of-arms, but does not possess any crown jewels or regalia per se.\nNorway.\nThe Crown Regalia, or crown jewels, of Norway are together with some other old treasures on permanent display in an exhibition at the Archbishop's Palace next to the Nidaros Cathedral, in Trondheim.\nPoland.\nThe only surviving part of the Polish crown jewels is from the Piast dynasty and consists of the coronation sword known as the Szczerbiec. It is currently on display along with other royal items in the Wawel Royal Castle Museum, Krak\u00f3w. Most of the crown jewels were plundered by retreating Prussian troops from Krak\u00f3w in 1794.\nOne of many royal crowns was made for King Augustus II, Elector of Saxony when he became King of Poland in 1697. Since the original set was unavailable, a new set was made for the coronation in Krak\u00f3w. However, the original set was regained, and the new set was never used. Today it is displayed in the Royal Castle in Dresden, Germany.\nSimilarly to Augustus II, his son Augustus III had difficulties with reaching the original set, and was forced to order a creation of a new one. His and his wives' crown jewels are the only Polish regalia set used for the coronation that have survived in its entirety.\nPortugal.\nThe Portuguese Crown Jewels were the pieces of jewelry, regalia, and vestments worn by the monarchs of Portugal during the time of the Portuguese Monarchy. Over the nine centuries of Portuguese history, the Portuguese Crown Jewels have lost and gained many pieces. Most of the current set of the Portuguese Crown Jewels are from the reigns of King Jo\u00e3o VI and King Lu\u00eds I.\nRomania.\nThe Romanian crown jewels consist of three crowns: the Steel Crown, the Crown of Queen Elisabeta and the Crown of Queen Marie; and two scepters: the Scepter of Ferdinand I and the Scepter of Carol II. They are displayed at the National Museum of Romanian History in Bucharest.\nThe Romanian Communist dictator Nicolae Ceau\u0219escu also sometimes made use of a scepter in his public appearances.\nRussia.\nThe coronation regalia, such as the Imperial Crown of Russia, the Imperial Orb of Catherine the Great, the Imperial Sceptre with the Orlov Diamond, the Shah Diamond, and others are kept at the Kremlin Armoury and Diamond Fund in Moscow.\nSerbia.\nIn Middle Ages, since 10th century Serbia had adopted diverse variants of crowns by Serbian Noble Families and Dynasties like Vojislavljevi\u0107, Vukanovi\u0107, Nemanji\u0107, Dejanovi\u0107, Lazarevi\u0107, Brankovi\u0107 and Mrnjav\u010devi\u0107. The crown's peak was during the Serbian empire, led by Emperor of Serbia Stefan Dusan Nemanjic.\nThe Crown jewels design was influenced by Eastern and Western European Art.\nThe Kara\u0111or\u0111evi\u0107 crown jewels of Serbia were created in 1904 for the coronation of King Peter I. The pieces were made from material that included bronze of Kara\u0111or\u0111e's cannon. This gesture was symbolic because 1904 was the 100th anniversary of the First Serbian Uprising. They were made in Paris by the famous Falise brothers jewellery company.\nSlovenia.\nA document known as \"The Swabian Mirror\" or \"Schwabenspiegel\" (c. 1275) refers to the installation of the dukes of Carantania and in it mentions a crown of sorts called the \"Slovenian Hat\" (\"windischer huot\"). This crown was placed on the head of the duke during the enthronement ceremony. The crown or hat is described as \"a grey Slovenian Hat with a grey cord and four leaves suspended from the brim\". In 1358 the Habsburg Duke Rudolf IV imparted coats of arms to those provinces without them and ordered the \"Slovenian Hat\" to be placed above the arms of the Slovenian March (later called Lower Carniola and now a province of Slovenia).\nA crown called the \"ducal hat\" of Carniola still exists in Graz.\nSpain.\nThe kingdoms that would consolidate to form Spain during the 15th and 16th centuries, namely the Kingdoms of Castile and Aragon, did not have consistent coronation ceremonies. The last recorded coronation ceremony in what would become Spain occurred in the 15th century; since then, the monarchs were not crowned, but proclaimed. As such, there was decreased importance for a coherent set of crown jewels, as these are usually themselves coronation regalia.\nMuch of what did exist into the modern era of the regalia of Spain was destroyed in the Great Fire of Madrid of Christmas Eve 1734. In the 18th century, King Charles III ordered a new crown and sceptre to be made. This crown is made of golden silver, and it features half-arches resting on eight plates bearing the emblems of the kingdom. The crown and scepter are displayed during the opening of the \"Cortes\" (Parliament). During ceremonies of accession with a new monarch, the crown and scepter are also present, but the crown itself is never placed on the monarch's head. Today they are kept by the \"Patrimonio Nacional\" (the National Heritage).\nToday, there are other pieces of jewelry and historically important items that would be considered \"crown jewels\" in other countries but are not denominated as such in Spain. In terms of jewelry, all of the jewels and tiaras worn by the members of the Spanish royal family are privately owned by them. More historically important elements are kept as pieces of cultural interest in different parts of Spain. For example, the personal crown used by Isabella I of Castile, her scepters, and her sword, are kept in the Royal Chapel in the Cathedral of Granada. As a consequence, this means that beyond the crown and scepter used during important occasions of the Spanish state, there is no other element of the crown jewels of Spain.\nSweden.\nSweden's crown jewels are kept deep in the vaults of the Royal Treasury, underneath the Royal Palace in Stockholm, in a museum which is open to the public. The symbols of the Swedish monarchy have not actually been worn since 1907, but are still displayed at weddings, christenings and funerals. Until 1974 the crown jewels were also displayed at the opening of the \"Riksdag\" (Parliament). Among the oldest objects are the sword of Gustav Vasa and the crown, orb, sceptre and key of King Erik XIV and numerous other sovereigns.\nUkraine.\nCrown of Galicia\u2013Volhynia, presented to Daniel of Galicia by Innocent IV, is believed to have been lost.\nThe United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.\nEngland.\nThe crown jewels of England, now of the United Kingdom, are kept in the Tower of London. Apart from a 12th-century anointing spoon and three early 17th-century swords, they all date from after the Restoration of Charles II in 1661. The ancient crown jewels of England were destroyed by Oliver Cromwell in 1649 when he established the Commonwealth of England. St Edward's Crown is the centrepiece of the coronation regalia, used at the moment of crowning and exchanged for the lighter Imperial State Crown, which is also worn at State Openings of Parliament. Among the precious stones on the crown are Cullinan II, the Stuart Sapphire, St Edward's Sapphire, and the Black Prince's Ruby (a spinel). On the Sovereign's Sceptre with Cross is Cullinan I, the largest clear cut diamond in the world. Wives of kings are crowned as Queen Consort with a plainer set of regalia. The Crown of Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother houses the 105-carat Koh-i-Noor diamond. In addition to crowns there are also various orbs, swords, coronets, rings and other pieces of regalia.\nScotland.\nThe Honours, or 'crown jewels', including the Stone of Scone, are kept in Edinburgh Castle. They are the oldest surviving crown jewels in the United Kingdom. The crown dates from at least 1540 and the sceptre and the sword were gifts by Pope Alexander VI and Pope Julius II respectively to the King of Scotland in the 15th and 16th centuries. They were hidden during the Interregnum. The Honours of Scotland were almost forgotten following their last use at the coronation of Charles II in 1651 until they were discovered in a chest inside Edinburgh Castle in the early 19th century.\nA 'golden royal crown' pre-dating the existing 'Honours' had been in existence. It is recorded that it was seized by the English authorities following a search of the luggage of the deposed John Balliol as he attempted to leave England and make his way to exile in France following his release from imprisonment in London in 1299. This crown was sent to King Edward I in London where it was probably placed with the English crown jewels at Westminster Abbey. The later fate of this crown is not entirely clear, but it may have been returned to Scotland during the negotiations between Robert I of Scotland and Edward II of England (following the English defeat at Bannockburn in 1314) or perhaps was returned to Scotland for use in the coronation of Edward Balliol when he was installed as king of Scots by England in 1332. Nevertheless, it is not in existence today.\nWales.\nThe original regalia of the Welsh princes have been lost. Llywelyn's coronet was kept after its capture with the English crown jewels between 1284 and 1649.\nThe Vatican.\nThe regalia of the papacy are kept in the Vatican City. \"For further Information, see Papal regalia and insignia.\"\nThe Americas.\nBrazil (Empire of Brazil).\nThe Imperial Crown of Brazil along with other regalia and mementos of the Brazilian Empire are kept at the Imperial Museum of Brazil (\"Museu Imperial\") in the former summer palace of Brazilian emperor Pedro II, in Petr\u00f3polis, Brazil. Some pieces are also owned by the jewellery collector Aim\u00e9e de Heeren, former mistress of President Get\u00falio Vargas.\nChile.\nThe Kingdom of Araucania and Patagonia has a crown, presented to Prince Philippe of Araucania in 1986 by a group of Araucanian nobles. Previously, the Royal House had no crown. Made of steel and containing stones from the Biob\u00edo River, it is on display at the Museum of the Kings of Araucania, outside the village of Chourgnac d'Ans, Dordogne, France.\nMexico.\nPrior to the Spanish conquest (1519\u20131522) most of present-day Mexico formed the Aztec Empire, a Native American empire ruled from Tenochtitl\u00e1n (present day Mexico City) by a \"tlatoani\" or \"emperor\". The ceremonial feathered headdress or \"quetzal\u0101panecay\u014dtl\" that was worn by Montezuma II (the last reigning emperor) was seized by the Spanish Conquistadors in c. 1520 and sent back to Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor and King of Spain as a gift. Remarkably, it still survives and Montezuma's headdress can be seen at the Museum of Ethnology, Vienna (inventory number 10402VO) along with other ancient Mexican artifacts.\nSetting aside the artifacts of Aztec and Spanish rule, there are also extant remnants of the imperial regalia of the First Mexican Empire and Second Mexican Empire.\nOceania.\nAustralia.\nAs a member of the Commonwealth of Nations, Australia's crown jewels are those in the collection of the Crown Jewels of the United Kingdom. The government of the Commonwealth of Australia at the behest of Prime Minister Robert Menzies, together with those of the United Kingdom, Canada, New Zealand, South Africa, Pakistan, Ceylon, and Southern Rhodesia, presented to Elizabeth II a pair of armills for her 1953 coronation, to replace those made in 1661 for the coronation of Charles II. They remain a part of the crown jewels of the monarch of Australia and the other Commonwealth realms.\nHawaii.\nSome of the crown jewels and the original thrones of the Kingdom of Hawaii reside within the custody of the Bishop Museum. The King's crown is owned by the State of Hawaii. All are currently on display in the throne room at Iolani Palace.\nThe two royals crowns were ordered from England in 1883 during Kalakaua's coronation. Worn once and only by Kalakaua and his Queen Kapiolani, they were damaged by looters during the overthrow but later restored and replace with glass jewels. An earlier crown belonging to the Kamehameha dynasty may have existed. In 1855, missionary Samuel C. Damon, who attended the funeral of Kamehameha III, mentioned \"At the foot and in front of the coffin was the Royal Crown, covered with crape, resting upon a velvet cushion\" at the foot of the King's casket. This crown was still being stored in the Royal Tomb at Pohukaina when Russian explorer Aleksei Vysheslavtsev visited the coral-house mausoleum during the funeral of John William Pitt K\u012bna\u02bbu in 1859. On May 26, 1861, Sophia Cracroft, the niece of Lady Franklin, also described the crown during a visit to Pohukaina.\nIf there ever was such a crown, it was either interred in the Royal Mausoleum with the last of the Kamehameha kings or became lost by 1883. King Lunalilo was buried in 1874 with a silver crown bore by John M\u0101kini Kapena in his funeral procession. This crown was kept in the Lunalilo Mausoleum until 1917 when it was stolen by two robbers named Albert Gerbode and Paul Payne from Key West, Florida and subsequently melted into a silver bar.\nCopies of the thrones can be seen at Iolani Palace. Some of the crown jewels lie in state with the royals at the Royal Mausoleum at Mauna Ala. Feather cloak and wear are among the oldest of Hawaiian regalias: N\u0101hi\u02bbena\u02bbena's P\u0101\u02bb\u016b, the 180 feather skirt of N\u0101hi\u02bbena\u02bbena and later the funeral attire for the dead monarch while lying in state; Kamehameha's Cloak, the war-cloak of Kamehameha I made entirely of the golden-yellow feathers of the now-extinct mamo, which was used to drape the throne of the King when it wasn't being worn; K\u012bwala\u02bb\u014d's Cloak, a.k.a. the Queen's Cloak, the cloak won by Kamehameha during his battle with Kiwalao, and used to drape the throne of the Queen; and Liloa's Kaei, the feather belt of Liloa, the 14th-century King of Hawaii. Also the \"Kiha-pu\" or the War Trumpet (Conch Shell) of Kihanuilulumoku which is one generation older than Liloa's Kaei.\nNew Zealand.\nK\u012bngitanga is an unofficial kingdom, but one that has become an important one to the M\u0101ori people today. The current monarch is T\u016bheitia Paki. The crown regalia consists of a type of cloak, known to M\u0101ori as a korowai, and 'crowning' ceremonies are performed by holding a bible over the new monarch's head.\nTahiti.\nThe Kingdom of Tahiti had a crown. The crown was a gift from the London Missionary Society to King P\u014dmare III for his coronation in 1824. The original is housed in the \"Mus\u00e9e de Tahiti et des \u00celes\" in Punaauia.\nTonga.\nThe Crown of Tonga was made in 1873 for George Tupou I at the behest of his prime minister, The Reverend Shirley Waldemar Baker. The crown was fashioned by the jewellery firm of Hardy Brothers of Sydney, Australia. The gold crown of Tonga is reputedly the largest and heaviest crown in the world.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

When Telemachus reached manhood, he visited Pylos and Sparta in search of his wandering father. On his return to Ithaca, he found that Odysseus had reached home before him. Then father and son slay the suitors who had gathered around Penelope. According to later tradition, Telemachus married Circe after Odysseus's death.\nThe first four books of the \"Odyssey\" focus on Telemachus's journeys in search of news about his father, who has yet to return home from the Trojan War, and are traditionally given the title \"Telemachy\".\nEtymology.\nTelemachus's name in Greek means \"far from battle\", or perhaps \"fighting from afar\", as a bowman does.\n\"Odyssey\".\nIn Homer's \"Odyssey\", Telemachus, under the instructions of Athena (who accompanies him during the quest), spends the first four books trying to gain knowledge of his father, Odysseus, who left for Troy when Telemachus was still an infant. At the outset of Telemachus's journey, Odysseus had been absent from his home at Ithaca for twenty years due to the Trojan War and the intervention of Poseidon. During his absence, Odysseus's house has been occupied by hordes of suitors seeking the hand of Penelope. Telemachus first visits Nestor and is well received by the old man who regales him with stories of his father's glory. Telemachus then departs with Nestor's son Peisistratus, who accompanies him to the halls of Menelaus and his wife Helen. Whilst there, Telemachus is again treated as an honored guest as Menelaus and Helen tell complementary yet contradictory stories of his father's exploits at Troy. Telemachus also learns from Menelaus that his father was last seen stranded on Ogygia.\nTelemachus focuses on his father's return to Ithaca in Book XV. He visits Eumaeus, the swineherd, who happens to be hosting a disguised Odysseus. After Odysseus reveals himself to Telemachus due to Athena's advice, the two men plan the downfall of the suitors. Telemachus then returns to the palace to keep an eye on the suitors and to await his father as the beggar.\nWhen Penelope challenges the suitors to string Odysseus's bow and shoot an arrow through the handle-holes of twelve axe heads, Telemachus is the first to attempt the task. He would have completed the task, nearly stringing the bow on his fourth attempt; however, Odysseus subtly stops him before he can finish his attempt. Following the suitors' failure at this task, Odysseus reveals himself and he and Telemachus bring swift and bloody death to the suitors.\n\"Telegony\".\nThe \"Telegony\" was a short two-book epic poem recounting the life and death of Odysseus after the events of the \"Odyssey\". In this mythological postscript, Odysseus is accidentally killed by Telegonus, his unknown son by the goddess Circe. After Odysseus's death, Telemachus returns to Aeaea with Telegonus and Penelope, and there marries Circe.\nSeemingly later tradition included the character of Cassiphone\u2014the daughter of Odysseus and Circe, and therefore half-sister of Telemachus\u2014into the narrative. In this account, Telemachus still marries Circe, but Odysseus is resurrected by Circe at some point.\nLater classical authors.\nFrom the \"Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology\": In the post-Homeric traditions, we read that Palamedes, when endeavouring to persuade Odysseus to join the Greeks against Troy, and the latter feigned idiocy, placed the infant Telemachus before the plough with which Odysseus was ploughing.\nIn \"Contest of Homer and Hesiod\", it is alleged that the Roman Emperor Hadrian asked the Delphic Oracle about Homer's birthplace and parentage. The Oracle replied that Homer came from Ithaca and that Telemachus was his father by Epicasta, daughter of Nestor.\nAccording to Aristotle and Dictys of Crete, Telemachus married Nausicaa, King Alcinous's daughter, and fathered a son named Perseptolis or Ptoliporthus.\nEustathius says that the mother was Polycaste, the daughter of Nestor. Others relate that he became the father of Latinus by Circe. He is also said to have had a daughter called Roma, who married Aeneas.\nServius makes Telemachus the founder of the town of Clusium in Etruria.\nOther appearances.\nTelemachus was the subject of numerous operas throughout the eighteenth century, most based on F\u00e9nelon's version. Among the most famous of these operas were Andr\u00e9 Cardinal Destouches's \"T\u00e9l\u00e9maque\" (1714), Alessandro Scarlatti's \"Telemaco\" (1718), Gluck's \"Telemaco, ossia L'isola di Circe\" (1765), Giuseppe Gazzaniga's \"Gli errori di Telemaco\" (1776), Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Le Sueur's \"T\u00e9l\u00e9maque dans l'\u00eele de Calypso ou Le triomphe de la sagesse\" (1796), Simon Mayr's \"Telemaco nell'isola di Calipso\" (1797), and Fernando Sor's \"Telemaco nell'isola di Calipso\" (1797).\nLes Aventures de T\u00e9l\u00e9maque is a novel by Fran\u00e7ois F\u00e9nelon.\nTelemachus appears in Alfred, Lord Tennyson's 1833 poem \"Ulysses\", where the title speaker (based on Dante's version) hands over his throne to him to spend the rest of his life wandering.\nTelemachus is a frequent character in the poetry of Louise Gl\u00fcck.\nTelemachus was the name of Carole King's cat and is pictured on the cover of her album \"Tapestry\".\n\"Telemachus\" is the title of a poem by American poet Ocean Vuong.\nTelemachus is featured in a musical adaptation of the \"Odyssey\" entitled \"\".\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Sister-inline/styles.css\"/&gt; Media related to at Wikimedia Commons"}

Depending on the league, the playoffs may be either a single game, a series of games, or a tournament, and may use a single-elimination system or one of several other different playoff formats. Playoff, in regard to international fixtures, is to qualify or progress to the next round of a competition or tournament.\nIn team sports in the U.S. and Canada, the vast distances and consequent burdens on cross-country travel have led to regional divisions of teams. Generally, during the regular season, teams play more games in their division than outside it, but the league's best teams might not play against each other in the regular season. Therefore, in the postseason a playoff series is organized. Any group-winning team is eligible to participate, and as playoffs became more popular they were expanded to include second- or even lower-placed teams \u2013 the term \"wild card\" refers to these teams.\nIn association football, playoffs are often used in the qualification for international tournaments such as the FIFA World Cup. They offer a second chance to the teams failing to qualify directly, and may be regional or intercontinental. In England and Scotland, playoffs are used to decide promotion for lower-finishing teams, rather than to decide a champion in the way they are used in North America. In the EFL Championship (the second tier of English football), teams finishing 3rd to 6th after the regular season compete to decide the third promotion spot to the Premier League.\nThe term \"post-season\" is also used in individual sports such as the sport of athletics or swimming to describe the period of championship meetings (such as regional championships, NCAA conference championships, national championships, or world championships) or their qualifiers after the regular season has concluded.\nAmerican football.\nNational Football League.\nEvidence of playoffs in professional football dates to at least 1919, when the \"New York Pro Championship\" was held in Western New York (it is possible one was held in 1917, but that is not known for sure). The Buffalo and Rochester metropolitan areas each played a final, the winners of which would advance to the \"New York Pro Championship\" on Thanksgiving weekend. The top New York teams were eventually absorbed into the National Football League upon its founding in 1920, but the league (mostly driven by an Ohio League that did not have true finals, though they frequently scheduled \"de facto\" championship matchups) did not adopt the New York league's playoff format, opting for a championship based on regular-season record for its first twelve seasons; as a result, four of the first six \"championships\" were disputed. Technically, a vote of league owners was all that was required to win a title, but the owners had a gentlemen's agreement to pledge votes based on a score (wins divided by the sum of wins and losses, with a few tiebreakers). When two teams tied at the top of the standings in 1932, an impromptu playoff game was scheduled to settle the tie.\nThe NFL divided its teams into divisions in 1933 and began holding a single playoff final between division winners. In 1950 the NFL absorbed three teams from the rival All-America Football Conference, and the former \"divisions\" were now called \"conferences\", echoing the college use of that term. In 1967, the NFL expanded and created four divisions under the two conferences, which led to the institution of a larger playoff tournament. After the 1970 AFL\u2013NFL merger brought the American Football League into the NFL, the NFL began to use three divisions and a single wild-card team in each conference for its playoffs, in order to produce eight contenders out of six divisions; this was later expanded in 1978 and 1990 so that more wild-card teams could participate.\nIn 2002 the NFL added its 32nd team, the Houston Texans, and significantly reshuffled its divisional alignment. The league went from 6 division winners and 6 wild-card spots to 8 division winners and only 4 wild-card qualifiers; by 2020, the number of wild-card qualifiers returned to six. The winners of each division automatically earn a playoff spot and a home game in their first rounds, the three top non-division winners from each conference also make the playoffs as wild-card teams. The division winner with the best record in the regular season gets a first-round bye, and each of the other division winners plays one of the three wild-card teams. In the divisional round, the lowest-seeded winner of a wild-card game then plays the lone bye team; the two wild-card winners also advance to play each other. The winners of these two games go to the conference championships, and the winners of those conference finals then face each other in the Super Bowl.\nCollege football.\nDivision I NCAA Football FBS.\nThe College Football Playoff National Championship is a post-season college football bowl game, used to determine a national champion of the NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS), which began play in the 2014 college football season. The game serves as the final of the College Football Playoff, a bracket tournament between the top four teams in the country as determined by a selection committee, which was established as a successor to the Bowl Championship Series and its similar BCS National Championship Game. Unlike the BCS championship, the participating teams in the College Football Playoff National Championship are determined by two semi-final bowls\u2014hosted by two of the consortium's six member bowls yearly\u2014and the top two teams as determined by the selection committee do not automatically advance to the game in lieu of other bowls.\nThe game is played at a neutral site, determined through bids by prospective host cities (similarly to the Super Bowl and NCAA final four). When announcing it was soliciting bids for the 2016 and 2017 title games, playoff organizers said that the bids must propose host stadiums with a capacity of at least 65,000 spectators, and cities cannot host both a semi-final game and the title game in the same year.\nThe winner of the game is awarded a new championship trophy instead of the \"Crystal Football\", which has been given by the American Football Coaches Association (AFCA) since 1986; officials wanted a new trophy that was unconnected with the previous BCS championship system. The new College Football Playoff National Championship Trophy is sponsored by Dr Pepper, which paid an estimated $35 million for the sponsorship rights through 2020. The 26.5-inch high, 35-pound trophy was unveiled on July 14, 2014.\nDivision I NCAA Football FCS.\nThe NCAA Division I Football Championship is an American college football tournament played each year to determine the champion of the NCAA Division I Football Championship Subdivision (FCS). Prior to 2006, the game was known as the NCAA Division I-AA Football Championship. The FCS is the highest division in college football to hold a playoff tournament sanctioned by the NCAA to determine its champion. The twelve-team playoff system used by the Bowl Subdivision is not sanctioned by the NCAA.\nDivision II NCAA Football.\nThe NCAA Division II Football Championship is an American college football tournament played annually to determine a champion at the NCAA Division II level. It was first held in 1973. Prior to 1973, four regional bowl games were played in order to provide postseason action for what was then called the \"NCAA College Division\" and a poll determined the final champion.\nThe National Championship final was held at Sacramento, California from 1973 to 1975. It was in Wichita Falls, Texas in 1976 and 1977. The game was played in Longview, Texas in 1978. For 1979 and 1980, Albuquerque, New Mexico hosted the game. McAllen, Texas hosted the finals from 1981 to 1985. From 1986 to 2013, the Division II final was played at Braly Municipal Stadium near the campus of the University of North Alabama in Florence, Alabama. Between 2014 and 2017, it was played at Children's Mercy Park in Kansas City, Kansas. Since 1994, the games have been broadcast on ESPN.\nDivision III NCAA Football.\nThe NCAA Division III Football Championship began in 1973. Before 1973, most of the schools now in Division III competed either in the NCAA College Division or the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA). NCAA Divisions II and III were created by splitting the College Division in two, with schools that wished to continue awarding athletic scholarships placed in Division II and those that did not want to award them placed in Division III.\nThe Division III playoffs begin with 32 teams selected to participate in them. The Division III final, known as the Stagg Bowl, has been played annually in Salem, Virginia at Salem Football Stadium since 1993. It was previously played in Phenix City, Alabama at Garrett-Harrison Stadium (1973\u20131982, 1985\u20131989), at the College Football Hall of Fame, when the Hall was located in Kings Island, Ohio at Galbreath Field (1983\u20131984), and Bradenton, Florida at Hawkins Stadium (1990\u20131992).\nAssociation football.\nAs a rule, international association football has only had championship playoffs when a league is divided into several equal divisions, conferences or groups (Major League Soccer) or when the season is split into two periods (as in many leagues in Latin America). In leagues with a single table done only once a year, as in most of Europe, playoff systems are not used to determine champions, although in some countries such systems are used to determine teams to be promoted to higher leagues (e.g., England) or qualifiers for European club competitions (such as Greece and the Netherlands), usually between teams that didn't perform well enough to earn an automatic spot.\nA \"test match\" is a match played at the end of a season between a team that has done badly in a higher league and one that has done well in a lower league of the same football league system. The format of a test match series varies; for instance it can be a head-to-head between one of the worse finishers of the higher league and one of the better finishers of the lower league, or it can be a mini league where all participants play each other or teams only play those from the other league. The winner of the test match series play in the higher league the following season, and the loser in the lower league.\nInternational playoffs.\nIn international football, playoffs were a feature of the 1954 and 1958 FIFA World Cup final tournaments. They are still a feature of the qualification tournaments for the FIFA World Cup and the UEFA European Football Championship.\nIn the qualification playoffs for the 2006 World Cup, for example:\nLater World Cup qualifying inter-confederation play-offs were held for 2010, 2014, 2018 and 2022.\nCONCACAF Nations League and UEFA Nations League hold their respective finals to determine the overall winner at the end of the league, CONCACAF Nations League Finals and UEFA Nations League Finals.\nArgentina.\nIn Argentine football, playoffs in the style of the English leagues occur in the Primera B Metropolitana, part of the third tier, and leagues below it (Primera C Metropolitana and Primera D Metropolitana). All \"Primera Metropolitana\" tourneys cover the area in and around Buenos Aires, the capital city. The \"Torneo Reducidos\" (reduced tournaments), however, involve 8 teams below the top two, as opposed to 4.\nBefore the top-flight Argentine Primera Divisi\u00f3n abandoned its traditional Apertura and Clausura format in 2015 in favor of an expanded single season, there was no playoff between the Apertura and Clausura winners. As a result, the league crowned two champions each year. After each Clausura, the two teams with the lowest points-per-game total for the previous six tournaments (three years, counting only Primera Divisi\u00f3n games) were relegated to Primera B Nacional to be replaced by that league's champion and runner-up teams; the two teams immediately above contested promotion/relegation series with the third and fourth places in Primera B Nacional, counted by its aggregate table. In Primera B Nacional, the same procedure continues in use for relegation to either Primera B Metropolitana or Torneo Argentino A for non-Buenos Aires clubs. From 2015 onward, relegation from the Primera Divisi\u00f3n will be based solely on league position at the end of the season (which, effective in 2016\u201317, changed from a February\u2013December format to an August\u2013June format).\nAustralia.\nThe Australian A-League, which also features two teams in New Zealand, has determined its champions via a playoff system, officially known as the \"Finals Series\" (reflecting standard Australian English usage), since its inception in the 2005\u201306 season.\nFrom the league's inception through the 2008\u201309 season, the top four teams advanced to the finals series, employed using a modified Page playoff system. The top two teams at the end of league play were matched in one semifinal, with the winner advancing directly to the grand final and the loser going into the Preliminary Final. The next two teams played a semifinal for a place in the Preliminary Final, whose winner took the other place in the grand final. Both semifinals were two-legged, while the Preliminary Final and Grand Final were one-off matches.\nWhen the league expanded to 10 teams beginning in 2009\u201310, the finals expanded to six teams. The format of the six-team playoff established at that time was:\nStarting with the 2012\u201313 season, the finals format has been changed to a pure knockout tournament consisting entirely of one-off matches:\nThe concept of a finals series/playoff is standard in Australian sport.\nBelgium.\nThe Belgian First Division A (previously known as the \"First Division\" and \"Pro League\") has a fairly complex playoff system, currently consisting of two levels and at one time three.\nSince the 2009\u201310 season, playoffs have been held to determine the champion and tickets for the Champions League and Europa League. The six highest ranked teams play home-and-away matches against each other; a total of 10 matches each. The 6 participating teams start with the points accumulated during the regular competition divided by two. The first 3 teams after the play-offs get a European ticket. The fourth ranked team (or fifth, when the cup holder is already qualified for European football) plays a knock-out match against the winner of play-off 2. From 2009 to 2010 through 2015\u201316, teams ranked 7\u201314 played in two groups; from 2016 to 2017 forward, this playoff will continue to be contested in two groups, but with a total of 12 teams (details below). All points gained from the regular competition are lost. The two group winners play a final match to determine the winner of play-off 2. The winning team plays a final match against the fourth-ranked team (or fifth) for the last European ticket.\nThe play-off system has been criticized because more points per match can be earned in the play-off stage than in the regular competition. This way the team who wins the most matches isn't automatically the national champion. The biggest upside in favor of the play-off system is the higher number of matches (40 instead of 34 compared to the previous season) and more top matches. The extra matches also generate higher revenues for the teams.\nNonetheless, the higher number of matches takes an extra toll on teams and players. Besides play-offs, the Royal Belgian Football Association (KBVB) also introduced Christmas football in order to complete the extra matches in time. This posed some problems because a few matches had to be cancelled due to snowy pitches. The delays will probably cause the tight schedule to fail and postpone the end of the season.\nSome structural changes were instituted in 2015\u201316:\nFrom 1974 through 2015, the 15th team out of 16 in the final standings was involved in a playoff pool with three teams from the Belgian Second Division after each season, to determine which of these teams played in the First Division/Pro League the oncoming season. The lowest ranked team of the First Division/Pro League was relegated and replaced by the Second Division champion.\nOriginally, these playoffs were introduced in 1974 and were part of the Second Division, to determine which team was promoted to the highest level together with the division champions. From the 2005\u201306 season on, only one team was relegated directly from the First Division, with the 17th team taking part in the playoff. As a result, this playoff was still called the Belgian Second Division final round, although one team from the Pro League took part each year.\nStarting in 2015\u201316, this playoff was scrapped and replaced with direct relegation for the bottom Pro League/First Division A team only.\nFurther changes will be introduced to the Europa League playoffs from 2016 to 2017 forward. The playoff will involve a total of 12 teams\u2014nine from First Division A, and three from First Division B (the renamed Second Division). The First Division A qualifiers will be those finishing between 7th and 15th on the regular-season table. The First Division B qualifiers will be the top three teams from that league's regular-season table, excluding the division champion, which instead earns promotion to First Division A. As in the previous format, the teams will be divided into two groups, each playing home-and-away within the group, and the two group winners will play a one-off final, with the winner of that match advancing to a one-off match against the fourth- or fifth-place team from the championship playoff (depending on available European slots) for the final Europa League place.\nBrazil.\nIn Brazil, the Copa do Brasil, the second most prestigious country-wide competition, is contested in pure \"knockout\" format since its inception in 1989. While the top two tiers in the Brazilian League \u2013 S\u00e9rie A and S\u00e9rie B \u2013 are contested in double round robin format, the lower tiers S\u00e9rie C and S\u00e9rie D include knockout rounds in their final stages.\nBulgaria.\nBulgaria instituted an elaborate playoff system in its top flight, the First League, in the 2016\u201317 season.\nAfter the league's 14 teams play a full home-and-away season, the league splits into two playoffs\u2014a 6-team \"championship playoff\" and an 8-team \"qualifying playoff\", with the latter split into two 4-team groups. Each playoff begins with teams carrying over all goals and statistics from the home-and-away season.\nEach team in the championship playoff plays the others home and away one additional time. At the end of this stage:\nEach group within the qualifying playoff also plays home and away within its group; after this stage, teams enter another level of playoffs depending on their positions in the group.\nThe top two teams in each group enter a knockout playoff consisting entirely of two-legged matches (unless one of these teams is the winner of that season's Bulgarian Cup, in which case it will not enter the playoff and the team that it would have played receives a bye into the playoff final). The winner of this playoff then contests a one-off match against the third-place (or fourth-place) team from the championship playoff, with the winner claiming the final Europa League place.\nThe bottom two teams from each group begin a series of relegation playoffs. The series starts with a knockout playoff that also consists entirely of two-legged matches. The winner of the playoff remains in the First League for the following season. The losing teams then enter the following series of two-legged promotion/relegation matches:\nDominican Republic.\nWith the creation of the Liga Dominicana de F\u00fatbol in 2014 to replace the Primera Divisi\u00f3n de Republica Dominicana, it introduced a playoff system to determine the champion of the season. This is more a deference to baseball, which employs the system, being traditionally the most popular sport in the nation.\nEngland and Wales.\nWhen the Football League was first expanded to two divisions in 1892, test matches were employed to decide relegation and promotion between them, but the practice was scrapped in favour of automatic relegation and promotion in 1898.\nThe use of play-offs to decide promotion issues returned to the League in 1986 with the desire to reduce the number of mid-table clubs with nothing to play for at the end of the season. The Football Conference, now known as the National League, introduced play-offs in 2002 after the Football League agreed to a two-club exchange with the Conference.\nThe top two teams in the EFL Championship and in EFL League One are automatically promoted to the division above and thus do not compete in the play-offs. The top three teams in EFL League Two and the champion of the National League (formerly known as Conference Premier) are also automatically promoted. In EFL playoffs, the four clubs finishing below the automatic promotion places compete in two-legged semi-finals with the higher-placed club enjoying home advantage in the second leg. In the National League however, the six clubs finishing below the champions compete in playoffs - the lower four competing in an elimination match to decide who plays in the semifinals (the top two receive a bye into the semifinals). The away goals rule does not apply for the semi-finals. The Football League play-off finals were originally played in two legs, at both teams' home grounds, but were later changed to one-off affairs, which are played at Wembley Stadium in London.\nTeams are also promoted using a play-off tournament from levels six to eight of the football pyramid. At level six, the play-off semi-finals are two leg ties with the final being a single match played at the home ground of the highest placed of the two teams. At levels seven and eight, all of the ties are single matches played at the home ground of the team with the highest league position.\nIn 2003, Gillingham proposed replacing the current play-off system with one involving six clubs from each division and replacing the two-legged ties with one-off matches. If adopted, the two higher-placed clubs in the play-offs would have enjoyed first-round byes and home advantage in the semi-finals. It was a controversial proposal \u2014 some people did not believe a club finishing only in eighth position in the League could (or should) compete in the Premiership while others found the system too American for their liking. Although League chairmen initially voted in favour of the proposal, it was blocked by The FA and soon abandoned.\nThe championship of every division in English football is determined solely by the standings in the league. However, a championship play-off would be held if the top two teams were tied for points, goal difference, goals scored in both their overall league record, and identical head-to-head record (including head-to-head away goals scored); to date, this has never happened. A play-off would also be scheduled if two teams are tied as above for a position affecting promotion, relegation, or European qualification.\nGreece.\nStarting in the 2007\u201308 season, Super League Greece instituted a playoff system to determine all of its places in European competition for the following season, except for those of the league champion and the cup winner. Currently, the league is entitled to two Champions League places and three in the Europa League, with one of the Europa League places reserved for the cup winner. The playoff currently takes the form of a home-and-away mini-league involving the second- through fifth-place teams, under the following conditions:\nItaly.\nIn 2004\u201305, Italy's professional league introduced a promotion playoff to its second tier of football, Serie B. It operates almost identically to the system currently used in England. The top two clubs in Serie B earn automatic promotion to Serie A with the next four clubs entering a playoff to determine who wins the third promotion place, as long as fewer than 10 points separate the third and fourth-placed teams (which often occurs).\nLike the English playoffs, the Italian playoffs employ two-legged semi-finals, with the higher finisher in the league table earning home advantage in the second leg. If the teams are level on aggregate after full-time of the second leg, away goals are not used, but extra time is used. Unlike England, the Italian playoff final is two-legged, again with the higher finisher earning home advantage in the second leg. In both rounds, if the tie is level on aggregate after extra time in the second leg, the team that finished higher in the league standings wins.\nIn 2003\u201304, Italy's football league used a two-legged test match to determine one spot in the top level of its system, Serie A. Some leagues in continental Europe combine automatic promotion/relegation with test matches. For example, in the Netherlands, only one club is automatically relegated from its top level, the Eredivisie, each season, with the winner of the second-flight being promoted. The next two lower-placed teams enter a promotion/relegation mini-league with high-placed teams from the Dutch First Division\nJapan.\nJ.League in Japan used a test match series between the third-from-bottom team in J1 and third-place team in J2 (see J. League promotion/relegation Series) from 2004 to 2008. The promotion/relegation Series concept dates as far back as 1965 and the first season of the Japan Soccer League.\nThe J.League Championship was held in J.League Division 1 from the inaugural season in 1993 to the 2004 season, and in the J1 League for the 2015 and 2016 seasons, as a post-season tournament to determine the annual champion.\nPromotion/relegation Series occurred with the 2012\u20132016 seasons of J. League Division 2/J2 League, conditional on the top two J3 League (JFL teams from 2012 to 2013) fulfilling J. League club criteria. In turn, J2 implemented a promotion playoff to J1 on the style of England for the 3rd to 6th clubs. The new J3 League did the same beginning in 2024.\nThe Japan Football League, the current Japanese 4th division, uses the promotion/relegation Series only when the number of clubs in the league needs to be filled with clubs from the Japanese Regional Leagues. In 2024 a promotion/relegation series was also added for the second places against the bottom J3 clubs, provided that they qualify for promotion criteria.\nMexico.\nMexico's top flight league, Liga MX, is contested annually by 18 teams. In each of two annual tournaments, every team plays every other team in the league once (17 games), after which the top eight teams advance to the \"Liguilla\".\nIn the Liguilla, all rounds are home-and-away. Teams are drawn so the best team plays the worst, the second-best plays the second-worst, and so on. After one round, the teams are redrawn so the best remaining team again plays the worst remaining one and the second-best faces the second-worst in the semi-finals. The two winners of this round play each other for the championship.\nThere is no playoff between the Apertura and Clausura winner. As a result, the league crowns two champions each year. After each Clausura, the team with the lowest points-per-game total for the previous six tournaments (three years, counting only Liga MX games) is relegated to Ascenso MX to be replaced by that league's champion (if eligible).\nNetherlands.\nIn the Netherlands, a playoff was introduced in the 2005\u201306 season. It is used to determine which teams from the Eredivisie qualify for European football. The playoff system has been criticized by clubs, players and fans as the number of matches will increase. Under the original playoff format, it was possible, though thoroughly unlikely, that the runner-up would not qualify for Europe; the following year, the format was changed so that the second-place team was assured of no worse than a UEFA Cup berth. Starting in 2008\u201309, the format was changed yet again. The champion goes directly to the Champions League; the runner-up enters the second qualification round of the CL; the number three enters the fourth (and last) qualification round of the UEFA Europa League (EL; the new name of the UEFA Cup from 2009 to 2010 onward) and the number four goes to the third qualification round of the EL. The only play-off will be for the clubs placed 5th through 8th. The winner of that play-off receives a ticket for the second qualification round of the EL.\nPlayoffs are also part of the promotion and relegation structure between the Eredivisie and the Eerste Divisie, the two highest football leagues in the Netherlands.\nPhilippines.\nThe Philippines Football League (PFL) adopted a playoffs for its inaugural 2017 season. The top four clubs of the regular season qualified for the playoffs which was dubbed as the \"Finals Series\". The Finals Series was dropped after the establishment of the Copa Paulino Alcantara which became the PFL's cup tournament.\nScotland.\nThe Scottish Football League (SFL) experimented briefly with test matches in 1995\u201396 and 1996\u201397, contested between the second-bottom team of the Premier Division and the second-placed team of the First Division.\nAfter the Scottish Premier League (SPL) and SFL merged in 2013 to form the Scottish Professional Football League (SPFL), reuniting the top four divisions of Scotland since the breakaway of the SPL in 1998\u201399, a modified test match format was introduced between the Scottish Premiership and Scottish Championship. The bottom team from the first-tier Premiership is automatically relegated and is replaced by the winners of the second-tier Championship, provided that club meets Premiership entry criteria. The second-, third- and fourth-placed teams from the Championship qualify for a play-off consisting of two-legged ties, with the second-placed team receiving a bye to play the winner of the teams that finished third and fourth. The winner of this play-off then faces the second-bottom Premiership team, also over two legs, with the winner of that tie taking up the final Premiership place (again, assuming that the Championship club meets Premiership criteria).\nThe three lower divisions of the SPFL \u2014 the Championship, League One and League Two \u2014 continue with the promotion/relegation play-off system their predecessor SFL leagues used (the First Division, Second Division and Third Division, respectively). In the Championship/League One and League One/League Two, while the champions are automatically promoted and the bottom team relegated, there are play-offs of the second-bottom teams against the second-, third- and fourth-placed teams from the division below. Home and away ties decide semi-finals and a final, and the overall winner plays in the higher division the following season, with the loser playing in the lower division.\nBeginning with the 2014\u201315 season, promotion and relegation between the SPFL and the Scottish regional leagues were introduced. Following the end of the league season, the winners of the fifth-level Highland and Lowland Leagues compete in a two-legged playoff. The winner then enters a two-legged playoff against the bottom team from Scottish League Two, with the winner of that tie either remaining in or promoted to League Two.\nLong before the SPL era, two situations arose in which the top two teams in the table had to share the title as neither goal average nor goal difference had been instituted to break ties. The first was the inaugural season, in which Dumbarton and Rangers both earned 29 points and had to play off for the title. The match ended in a 0\u20130 draw and both teams shared the title. The second happened 19 years later, in the Second Division, when Leith Athletic and Raith Rovers both earned 33 points. This time, the clubs chose not to play off. In 1915 goal average was finally instituted.\nSpain.\nSince the 2010\u201311 season, the Segunda Divisi\u00f3n established promotion playoffs between the 3rd to 6th-placed teams, similar to the rules in the English and Italian systems. However, due to reserve teams being allowed to compete in the same football league system, subsequent places may be allowed to play off depending on reserve teams finishing within the 3rd to 6th places.\nAt a lower level, playoffs in Segunda Divisi\u00f3n B take place to decide the divisional title between the 4 group winners, and to decide which other teams would be promoted, as follows:\nPreviously a playoff system had been used in which the teams finishing 3rd and 4th from last in La Liga had played off against the teams finishing 3rd and 4th in the Segunda Divisi\u00f3n. This system had been introduced in the 1980s but ended in 1998\u201399.\nIn the women's game, since the 2022\u201323 season, the Primera Federaci\u00f3n Femenina has playoffs between the 2nd to 5th-placed teams, as only the champions are automatically promoted to Liga F. As in the men's game, subsequent places are promoted or allowed to play off if reserve teams finish within the top five.\nUnited States and Canada.\nIn Major League Soccer, the top flight in the United States and Canada, the MLS Cup Playoffs are contested after the end of the regular season by the top teams in each conference. The winner of the MLS Cup, the final match in the playoffs, is considered the league's champion for that season. The number of teams that qualify has varied: from the 2012 season to the 2014 season, the top five teams in each of its two conferences played in the playoffs; this was increased to six teams from 2015 to 2018 and later seven teams in the 2019 season, which also switched all rounds to single-elimination matches. Under this system, the conferences have separate playoff brackets.\nSince the 2023 edition, the MLS Cup Playoffs have had nine teams from each conference playing in separate brackets until the MLS Cup final. The preliminary round has the eighth seed hosting the ninth seed while the top seven seeds get a prelim-round bye. Whoever wins plays the top seed in Round One. In Round One, the top-seed hosts the eighth-ninth winner, the runner-up hosts the seventh seed, the third hosts the sixth, and the fourth hosts the fifth, in best-of-three games. The remaining rounds (the conference semifinals, conference final, and MLS Cup final) are single-elimination matches hosted by the team with the better regular season record. 62 percent of teams make the playoff under this new format.\nSince 2012, the MLS Cup has been hosted by the conference champion that has the most table points during the regular season.\nIn the case of ties after regulation in any round, 30 minutes of extra time (divided into two 15-minute periods) would be played followed by a penalty-kick shootout, if necessary, to determine the winners.\nThe defunct Women's Professional Soccer (WPS), which operated only in the U.S., conducted a four-team stepladder tournament consisting of one-off knockout matches. The third seed hosted the fourth seed in the first round. The winner of that game advanced to the \"Super Semifinal\", hosted by the second seed. The Super Semifinal winner traveled to the top seed for the final. The WPS's replacement, the National Women's Soccer League (which launched in 2013), uses a single elimination tournament. The current NWSL playoff structure has a more standard eight-team knockout playoff where the top-seed hosts the eighth, the runner-up hosts the seventh, the third-ranked team plays the sixth-ranked, and the fourth plays the fifth. The lowest-seeded winner from the quarterfinals plays the highest-seeded and the next-lowest the next-highest team in the semifinals. The winners of two one-off semifinals advance to the one-off final. From 2021 to 2023, the NWSL had a 6-team tournament; and from 2013 to 2019, it had a 4-team single elimination tournament.\nAustralian rules football.\nPlayoffs are used throughout Australia in Australian rules football to determine the premiership. The term finals is most commonly used to describe them.\nIn each league, between four and eight teams (depending on league size) qualify for the finals based on the league ladder at the end of the season. Australian rules football leagues employ finals systems which act as a combination between a single elimination tournament for lower-ranked teams and a double elimination tournament for higher-ranked teams in order to provide teams with an easier pathway to the grand final as reward for strong performances throughout the season. Finals are decided by single matches, rather than series.\nThe Australian Football League, which is the top level of the sport, currently has eight teams qualify for the finals under a system designed by the league in 2000. Between 1931 and 1999, variants of the McIntyre system were used to accommodate four, five, six and eight teams, and prior to 1930, six different finals systems were used.\nIn most other leagues, from state-level leagues such as the South Australian National Football League and West Australian Football League, down to local suburban leagues, it is most common for either four or five teams to qualify for the finals. In these cases the Page\u2013McIntyre final four system or the McIntyre final five system are used universally.\nThe Australian Football League (which was known until 1990 as the Victorian Football League) was the first league to introduce regular finals when it was established in 1897. The South Australian National Football League introduced finals in 1898, and other leagues soon followed.\nPrior to 1897, the premiership was generally awarded to the team with the best overall win\u2013loss record at the end of the season. If two teams had finished with equal records, a playoff match for the premiership was required: this occurred in the Challenge Cup in 1871, the South Australian Inter-club competition in 1874, the SAFA in 1889 and 1894, and in the VFA in 1896.\nBaseball.\nSouth Korea.\nThe teams finishing in fourth and fifth place in the regular season face each other in the wildcard game. The winner of the wildcard game faces the team that finished in third place in the first round of the play-offs. The winner of the first round faces the team that finished in second place during the regular season, and the winner of that round faces the team that finished in first place for the championship in the Korean Series. This type of format is known as the stepladder playoff.\nJapan.\nBefore 1950, the original Japanese Baseball League had been a single-table league of franchises. After it was reorganized into the Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB) system, a series of playoffs ensued between the champions of the Central League and Pacific League.\nBefore the playoff system was developed in both professional leagues, the Pacific League had applied a playoff system on two occasions. The first was between 1973 and 1982, when a split-season was applied with a 5-game playoff between the winning teams from both halves of season (unless a team won both of the halves so that they did not need to play such a game). The second time was between 2004 and 2006, when the top three teams played a two-staged stepladder knockout (3 games in the first stage and 5 games in the second stage) to decide the League Champion (and the team playing in the Japan Series). After this system was applied, the Seibu Lions (now Saitama Seibu Lions), Chiba Lotte Marines and Hokkaido Nippon Ham Fighters, which claimed the Pacific League Championship under this system, were all able to clinch the following Japan Series in that season. The success of such a playoff system convinced the Central League to consider a similar approach. In 2007, a new playoff system, named the \"Climax Series\", was introduced to both professional leagues in NPB to decide the teams that would compete for the Japan Series. The Climax Series basically applied the rule of the playoff system in the Pacific League, with one important change: each League championship is awarded to the team finishing the regular season at the top of their respective league, regardless of their fate in the playoffs. This means that the two League Champions are not guaranteed to make the Japan Series. The Chunichi Dragons took advantage of this in the first Climax Series season, finishing second in the regular season but sweeping the Hanshin Tigers and the League Champion Yomiuri Giants in the Central League to win a place in the Japan Series; they subsequently defeated the Hokkaido Nippon Ham Fighters to claim their first Japan Series in 52 years.\nIn 2008, the format of Climax Series will have a slight change, in which the second stage will be played over a maximum of six games, with the League Champion starting with an automatic one game advantage.\nUnited States and Canada.\nMajor League Baseball.\nMajor League Baseball (MLB) itself does not use the term \"playoffs\" for championship tournaments. Instead, it uses the term \"postseason\" as the title of the elimination tournament held after the conclusion of the regular season. From to and 2021 season, it consisted of a first round single-elimination Wild Card Game between the two wild-card teams in each league. From , the postseason begins with a two best-of-three Wild Card Series first round, followed by a best-of-five second round series called the Division Series, and two rounds of best-of-seven series for the League Championship Series and World Series. One exception is , when the first-round series, the Wild Card Series, a best-of-three round, was created, along with the other rounds. The first three seeds went to division champions, the next three seeds to division runners-up, and the last two to the next-best records. The pairings for the Wild Card Series are as follows: top seed vs. eighth, second vs. seventh, third vs. sixth, and fourth vs. fifth. The division series has the 1\u20138 winner play the 4\u20135 winner, while the 2\u20137 winner plays the 3\u20136 winner.\nMLB uses a \"2\u20133\u20132\" format for the final two rounds of its postseason tournament. The singular term \"playoff\" is reserved for the rare situation in which two (or more) teams find themselves tied at the end of the regular season and are forced to have a tiebreaking playoff game (or games) to determine which team will advance to the postseason. Thus, a \"playoff\" is actually \"part of the regular season\" and can be called a \"pennant playoff\". However, the plural term \"playoffs\" is conventionally used by fans and media to refer to baseball's postseason tournament, not including the World Series.\nMLB is the oldest of the major American professional sports, dating back to the 1870s. As such, it is steeped in tradition. The final series to determine its champion has been called the \"World Series\" (originally \"World's Championship Series\" and then \"World's Series\") as far back as the National League's contests with the American Association during the 1880s.\nMinor League Baseball.\nMost of the domestic Minor League Baseball (MiLB) leagues which are affiliated with Major League Baseball conduct playoffs after their regular season to determine champions.\nBefore the 2021 reorganization of MiLB, most leagues at the Triple-A, Double-A, and Class A-Advanced classification levels included four qualifying teams which competed in two best-of-five rounds: semi-finals and finals. Most Class A, Class A Short Season, and Rookie League playoffs consisted of two best-of-three rounds. The champions of the two Triple-A leagues, the International League and Pacific Coast League, met in the Triple-A National Championship Game, a single game to determine an overall champion of the classification.\nIn the 2021 season, the first after the reorganization, no MiLB league had more than two teams involved in playoffs, with some leagues not holding a postseason at all.\nTaiwan.\nTaiwan's playoff is different to many such competitions, due to the league's split-season format. The winners of the first half-season and the winners of the second half-season are eligible to play in the playoffs, but if the best overall team have not won either half season then they qualify into a wild card series against the weaker half-season winner, with the winner of this advancing into the Taiwan Series to face the other half-season winner. If the first and second half winners are different, but one of them is also the best overall team, then both teams progress directly to the Taiwan Series. Finally, if one team wins both halves of the season then a playoff will take place between the second and third best teams for the right to play them in the Final Series; in this case the team winning both halves of the season will begin the Taiwan Series with an automatic one game advantage.\nBasketball.\nNational Basketball Association.\nThe present organization known as the National Basketball Association, then called the BAA (Basketball Association of America), had its inaugural season in 1946\u201347. Teams had always have different strength of schedule from each other; currently, a team plays a team outside its conference twice, a team within its conference but outside its division three or four times, and a team from its own division four times.\nIn the current system, eight clubs from each of the league's two conferences qualify for the playoffs, with separate playoff brackets for each conference. In the 2002\u201303 season, the first-round series were expanded from best-of-5 to best-of-7; all other series have always been best-of-7. In all series, home games alternate between the two teams in a 2-2-1-1-1 format.\nThe 2-3-2 finals format was adopted from the 1985 Finals to 2013, copying the format that was then in effect in the National Hockey League. Prior to 1985, almost all finals were played in the 2-2-1-1-1 format (although the 1971 Finals between Milwaukee and Baltimore were on an alternate-home basis, some 1950s finals used the 2-3-2 format, and the 1975 Golden State-Washington and 1978 and 1979 Seattle-Washington Finals were on a 1-2-2-1-1 basis). Also, prior to the 1980s, Eastern and Western playoffs were on an alternate-home basis except for series when distance made the 2-2-1-1-1 format more practical. Since 2014, the NBA Finals restored the original format.\nTeams are seeded according to their regular-season record. Through the 2014\u201315 season, the three division champions and best division runner-up received the top four seeds, with their ranking based on regular-season record. The remaining teams were seeded strictly by regular-season record. However, if the best division runner-up had a better record than other division champs, it could be seeded as high as second. Beginning in 2015\u201316, the NBA became the first major American league to eliminate automatic playoff berths for division champions; the top eight teams overall in each conference now qualify for the playoffs, regardless of divisional alignment.\nSince the 2019\u201320 season, only the top six teams qualify directly to the playoffs. The remaining two teams in each conference are determined through what is officially considered a separate postseason tournament, consisting of the seventh through tenth-placed teams. Known as a play-in tournament, it consists of three, one-game series:\nThe winner of the 7\u20138 game advances to the playoffs as the 7th seed, while the loser faces the winner of the 9\u201310 game (the loser of it is eliminated from playoff contention). The winner of this third game advances to the playoffs as the 8th seed, while the loser is also eliminated from playoff contention. From there, the playoffs continue as normal.\nElsewhere.\nTop flight basketball leagues elsewhere also employ a playoff system mimicking the NBA's. However, most leagues are not divided into divisions and conferences, and employ a double round robin format akin to league association football, unlike the NBA where teams are divided into divisions and conferences, which leads to different strengths of schedule per team. Teams are seeded on regular season record. The playoff structure can be single-elimination or a best-of series, with the higher seed, if held the playoffs are not held at a predetermined venue, having the home court advantage.\nAside from the playoffs, some leagues also have a knockout tournament akin to the FA Cup running in parallel to the regular season. These are not considered playoffs.\nIn the EuroLeague, after the regular season plays a best-of-5 playoffs in a 2\u20132\u20131 format. However, from the semifinals on, it is a single elimination tournament held at a predetermined venue. Still others also have a relegation playoff.\nIn NCAA Division I basketball conferences, a playoff or \"postseason tournament\" is held after the regular season. Most conferences, including all of the \"major\" basketball conferences (ACC, American, Big East, Big Ten, Big 12, Pac-12, SEC), hold their tournaments at a predetermined venue, with all conference teams participating (unless barred due to NCAA sanctions). A few conferences hold early rounds at campus sites and later rounds at a predetermined site. For example, the Mid-American Conference holds its first-round games at campus sites, but the rest of the tournament in Cleveland. The Big South Conference holds its first round at campus sites, gives hosting rights for its quarterfinals and semifinals to the regular-season champion, and plays its final at the home court of the top remaining seed. The America East Conference, ASUN Conference, and Patriot League hold all tournament games at campus sites. A small number of conferences do not invite all of their teams to the conference tournament, with one example being the Ivy League, in which only four of the eight members advance to the tournament (which is at a predetermined site). In many such tournaments, higher seeds are afforded byes. The winners, and some losers which are selected as \"at-large bids\", play in the NCAA tournament, which is also single-elimination and held at predetermined venues.\nIn the WNBA Playoffs, the league's best 8 teams, regardless of conference alignment, compete, and are seeded based on their regular-season records. The top two seeds are reserved for the conference leaders plus the next six teams with the next-best records. Since 2025, the league quarterfinals are best-of-three on an odd-even basis, the league semifinals are best-of-5 on a 2-2-1 basis and the championship is best-of-seven, with a 2-2-1-1-1 basis.\nCanadian football.\nIn the Canadian Football League, the playoffs begin in November. After the regular season, the top team from each division has an automatic home game berth in the Division Final, and a bye week during the Division Semifinal. The second-place team from each division hosts the third-place team in the Division Semifinal, unless the fourth-place team from the opposite division finishes with a better record. This \"crossover rule\" does not come into play if the teams have identical records\u2014there are no tiebreakers. While the format means that it is possible for two teams in the same division to play for the Grey Cup, so far only two crossover teams have won the divisional semifinal game. The winners of each Division's Semifinal game then travel to play the first place teams in the Division Finals. Since 2005, the Division Semifinals and Division Finals have been sponsored by Scotiabank and are branded as the \"Scotiabank East Championship\" and \"Scotiabank West Championship\". The two division champions then face each other in the Grey Cup game, which is held on the third or fourth Sunday of November.\nThe Edmonton Elks are notable for qualifying for the CFL playoffs every year from 1972 to 2005, a record in North American pro sports. They are also the first crossover team to ever win the divisional semifinal game.\nThere were no playoffs in 2020.\nCricket.\nThere are a number of T20 leagues played in cricket for a few weeks each in many countries, which all generally follow some variation of the Page playoff system, and have 8 teams.\nBig Bash League.\nThe KFC Big Bash League (BBL) Finals Series is the playoff stage of the Australian professional men's Twenty20 cricket league. The current format involves four teams battling it out in a four-match structure to determine the season's champion. \nThe key feature of the finals series is the \"double-chance\" advantage given to the top two teams, which significantly rewards success in the regular season.\nIndian Premier League.\nThe Indian Premier League is the largest T20 league, and uses the Page playoff format: the top two teams in the group stage play a semi-final, and the third and fourth-place teams play an eliminator match, to determine which will remain in contention for the final. The two remaining teams that have not yet qualified for the final among the top four teams then play a second semi-final, and then the final occurs.\nT20 Blast.\nThe Vitality Blast, England and Wales' premier domestic T20 competition, uses a straightforward knockout structure to determine its champion, culminating in a spectacular single-day event known as Finals Day.\nThe four winning teams from the quarter-finals meet on a single day at a single neutral venue to determine the champion. This is universally known as Finals Day, and it is traditionally held at Edgbaston Stadium in Birmingham.\nFinals Day is famous for its festival atmosphere, non-stop cricket action, and the high-pressure nature of three winner-takes-all matches.\nThe Hundred.\nThe Hundred is an English 100-ball cricket tournament. The top three teams from the 8-team group stage advance to the playoffs, with the winner of a semi-final between the second and third-placed teams facing the table-toppers in the final.\nMinor League Cricket.\nMinor League Cricket (MiLC) features 27 American teams split into the Pacific and Atlantic conferences, each of which is split into two regional divisions. The top two teams from each division advance to the Quarterfinals, with the final contested by one team from each conference. The Quarterfinal is unique in that it is a best-of-three series, and that it sees the top team from one division playing the second-placed team from the other division of their conference; this offers teams an incentive to finish as high as possible in the league stage so as to draw an easier matchup in the Quarterfinals.\nHockey.\nNational Hockey League.\nThe National Hockey League playoff system is an elimination tournament competition for the Stanley Cup, consisting of four rounds of best-of-seven series. The first three rounds determine which team from each conference will advance to the final round, dubbed the Stanley Cup Finals. The winner of that series becomes the NHL and Stanley Cup champion.\nSince 2014, the Conference Quarterfinals consists of four match-ups in each conference, based on the seedings division-wise (No. 1 vs. No. 4, and No. 2 vs. No. 3). The division winner with the best record in the conference plays the lowest wild-card seed, while the other division winner plays the top wild-card seed (wild-card teams, who are de facto 4th seeds, may cross over to another division within the conference). In the Conference Semifinals, the four remaining teams in the conference face each other. In the third round, the Conference Finals, the two surviving teams play each other, with the conference champions proceeding to the Stanley Cup Finals.\nFor the first two rounds, the higher-seeded team has home-ice advantage (regardless of point record). Thereafter, it goes to the team with the better regular season record. In all rounds the team with home-ice advantage hosts Games 1, 2, 5 and 7, while the opponent hosts Games 3, 4 and 6 (Games 5\u20137 are played \"if necessary\").\nFor the , in which the regular season was prematurely ended by the COVID-19 pandemic only the top four teams in each conference, as determined by points-per-game, qualified directly to the First Round of the Stanley Cup Playoffs. The remaining four First Round teams per conference were determined by best-of-five \"Stanley Cup Qualifiers.\"\nKontinental Hockey League.\nThe Kontinental Hockey League, based in Russia and including teams from several nearby countries, operates a playoff system similar to that of the NHL, also consisting of four rounds of single-elimination best-of-seven series. The first three rounds determine which team from each conference will advance to the final round, dubbed the Gagarin Cup Finals. The winner of that series becomes the KHL and Gagarin Cup champion.\nLike the NHL, the Conference Quarterfinals consists of four match-ups in each conference. The winner of each division receives one of the top two seeds in its conference; the others are based on regular-season record. Unlike the NHL, divisional alignment plays no added role in playoff seeding\u2014all teams are seeded solely within their conference. Playoff pairings are based on seeding number within the conference (No. 1 vs. No. 8, No. 2 vs. No. 7, No. 3 vs. No. 6, and No. 4 vs. No. 5). The division winner with the best record in the conference plays the lowest wild-card seed, while the other division winner plays the next-lowest seed (wild-card teams, who are de facto 4th seeds, may cross over to another division within the conference). The playoff pairings are reseeded after the first round (a feature that was once used in the NHL, but now abandoned). Therefore, the Conference Semifinals feature the top remaining seed in the conference playing the lowest remaining seed, and the two other first-round survivors playing one another. In the third round, the Conference Finals, the two surviving teams play each other, with the conference champions proceeding to the Gagarin Cup Finals.\nFor the first two rounds, the higher-seeded team has home-ice advantage (regardless of point record). Thereafter, it goes to the team with the better regular season record. In all rounds the team with home-ice advantage hosts Games 1, 2, 5 and 7, while the opponent hosts Games 3, 4 and 6 (Games 5\u20137 are played \"if necessary\").\nElite Ice Hockey League.\nIn the United Kingdom, the Elite Ice Hockey League playoffs are an elimination tournament where the draw is based on the finishing position of teams in the league. Of the 10 teams which compete, the top 8 qualify for the playoffs. The first round (the quarter-finals) are played over two legs (home and away) where the team who finished in 1st place in the regular season plays the team which finished 8th, 2nd plays 7th and so on, with the aggregate score deciding which team progresses.\nThe semi-finals and final are held over the course of a single weekend at the National Ice Centre in Nottingham. Each consists of a single game with the losing team being eliminated, with the two semi-final games being played on the Saturday and the final on the Sunday. There is also a third-place game held earlier on the Sunday between the losing teams from the semi-finals. Unlike in the NHL, the winners of the Elite League playoffs are not considered to be the league champions for that season (that title goes to the team which finishes in first place in the league), rather the playoffs are considered to be a separate competition although being crowned playoff champions is a prestigious accolade nonetheless. The most recent playoff champions are the Nottingham Panthers.\nNASCAR.\nNASCAR implemented a \"playoff\" system beginning in 2004, which they coined the \"Chase for the NEXTEL Cup\". When first introduced, only NASCAR's top series used the system, although the other two national racing series (currently known as the Xfinity Series and the Gander Outdoors Truck Series) have since adopted similar systems. One unique feature of the NASCAR playoffs is that the non-qualifying drivers continue to compete alongside the playoff drivers: the qualifying drivers merely have their championship points reset one or more times during the playoffs to figures so high that no non-qualifying driver could ever catch them.\nThere are actually two different playoffs going on at the end of the season in each series: one for the drivers and another \"owner's points\" playoff for the racing teams. Only one multi-driver team has ever won the Cup series owner's point championship: in 2015, Kyle Busch won the championship after missing the first 11 races of the season due to injury; 3 other drivers drove the No. 18 car during his absence. Because of the way the playoffs were structured that year, however, both he and his No. 18 team won their respective championships with 5043 points. There have been two cases where a playoff driver failed to enter every playoff race. In 2005, Kurt Busch was fired by Roush Racing with two races left in the season. Busch finished 10th out of 10 Chase drivers, but Kenny Wallace stepped in to drive the No. 97 car to an 8th-place finish in the owner's points race. In 2012, Dale Earnhardt Jr. missed two playoff races due to injury. Regan Smith drove the No. 88 car for two races, including a top-10 finish at Kansas Speedway. In that case, Smith's 43 additional championship points on top of Earnhardt's 2,245 were not enough to pull the No. 88 team out of 12th place out of 12 playoff contenders.\nIn the original version of the Chase (2004\u20132006), following the 26th race of the season, all drivers in the top 10 and any others within 400 points of the leader got a spot in the 10-race playoff. Like the current system, drivers in the Chase had their point totals adjusted. However, it was based on the number of points at the conclusion of the 26th race. The first-place driver in the standings led with 5,050 points; the second-place driver started with 5,045. Incremental five-point drops continued through 10th place with 5,005 points.\nThe first major change to the Chase was announced by NASCAR chairman and CEO Brian France on January 22, 2007. After 26 races, the top 12 drivers advanced to contend for the points championship and points were reset to 5000. Each driver within the top 12 received an additional 10 points for each win during the \"regular season\", or first 26 races, thus creating a seeding based on wins. As in previous years, the Chase consisted of 10 races and the driver with the most points at the conclusion of the 10 races was the NEXTEL Cup Series Champion. Under the points system then in use, drivers could earn 5 bonus points for leading the most laps, and 5 bonus points for leading a single lap.\nBrian France explained why NASCAR made the changes to the chase:\n\"The adjustments taken [Monday] put a greater emphasis on winning races. Winning is what this sport is all about. Nobody likes to see drivers content to finish in the top 10. We want our sport -- especially during the Chase -- to be more about winning.\"\nBeginning with the 2008 season, the playoff became known as the \"Chase for the Sprint Cup\" due to the NEXTEL/Sprint merger.\nThe next format of the Chase was announced by France on January 26, 2011, along with several other changes, most significantly to the points system. After 26 races, 12 drivers still advanced to the Chase, but the qualifying criteria changed, as well as the number of base points that drivers received at the points reset.\nUnder this system. only the top 10 drivers in points automatically qualified for the Chase. They were joined by two \"wild card\" qualifiers, specifically the two drivers ranked from 11th through 20th in points who had the most race wins (with tiebreakers used if needed to select exactly two qualifiers). These drivers then had their base points reset to 2,000 instead of the previous 5,000, reflecting the greatly reduced points available from each race (a maximum of 48 for the race winner, as opposed to a maximum of 195 in the pre-2011 system). After the reset, the 10 automatic qualifiers received 3 bonus points for each race win, while the wild card qualifiers received no bonus.\nOn January 30, 2014, even more radical changes to the Chase were announced; these took effect for the 2014 season:\nThe Chase for the Sprint Cup has been generally panned since its inception, as many drivers and owners have criticized the declining importance of the first 26 races, as well as very little change in schedule from year to year. Mike Fisher, the director of the NASCAR Research and Development Center, has been one of the more vocal critics of the system, saying that \"Due to NASCAR having the same competitors on the track week in, week out, a champion emerges. In stick-and-ball sports, every team has a different schedule, so head-to-head series are necessary to determine a champion. That does not apply to auto racing.\"\nNASCAR extended the Chase format to its other two national touring series, the Xfinity Series and Gander Outdoors Truck Series (then the Camping World Truck Series), beginning in 2016. The formats used in the two lower series are broadly similar to the format used in the Cup Series, but have some significant differences:\nStarting with the 2017 season, NASCAR abandoned the term \"Chase\", instead calling its final series the \"playoffs\".\nRugby league.\nNational Rugby League.\nPlay-offs are used to decide the premiers of the National Rugby League (NRL) in Australasia, where they are known as \"finals\" (also as \"semi-finals\" or \"semis\") \u2013 as in Australian rules football, the participating teams only come from within a single division, and the tournament is staged as single matches rather than a series. Currently, in the NRL, eight teams qualify for the finals; starting with the 2012 season, the system was changed from the McIntyre final eight to the same system used by the AFL.\nPreviously, the term play-off was used in the NSWRL and BRL competitions to describe matches which were played as tie breakers to determine qualification for the finals series. Since 1995, points differential decides finals' qualification and play-offs are no longer held.\nSuper League.\nThe Super League rugby league competition has used a play-off system to decide its champion since 1998. The original play-off format featured the top five highest-ranked teams after the regular season rounds. Starting in 2002, the play-offs added an extra spot to allow the top six to qualify. With the addition of two new teams for the 2009 season, the play-offs expanded to eight teams. The next format, scrapped after the 2014 season, worked as follows:\nWeek One\nWeek Two\nWeek Three\nWeek Four\n\"* Opponents decided by the QPO winner (in Week 1) that finished higher in the regular season\nBeginning in 2015, the Super League season was radically reorganised, and more closely integrated with that of the second-level Championship. Following a home-and-away season of 22 matches, the top eight clubs in Super League now enter a single round-robin mini-league known as the Super 8s, with the top four teams after that stage entering a knockout play-off to determine the champion. The four bottom teams in Super League at the end of the home-and-away season are joined by the top four from the Championship after its home-and-away season. These eight teams play their own single-round-robin mini-league known as The Qualifiers; at its end, the top three teams are assured of places in the next season's Super League, with the fourth- and fifth-place teams playing a single match billed as the \"Million Pound Game\", with the winner also playing in Super League in the following season.\nOther leagues.\nThe two tiers directly below Super League, the Championship and League 1 (the latter of which was known as Championship 1 from 2009 to 2014)\u2014formerly the National Leagues until the 2009 addition of a French club to the previously all-British competition\u2014used the old top six system to determine which teams were promoted between its levels through the 2014 season. After that season, both leagues abandoned the top six system. Before the 2008 season, when Super League established a franchising system and ended automatic promotion and relegation in Super League, the National Leagues also used this system to determine the team that earned promotion to Super League. The top six system involved the following:\nWeek One\nWeek Two\nWeek Three\nWeek Four\nSince 2015, all clubs in Super League and the Championship play a 22-match home-and-away season. Upon the end of the home-and-away season, the clubs will split into three leagues, with two of them including Championship clubs. The Super 8s will feature the top eight Super League sides. The second league, The Qualifiers, will include the bottom four clubs from Super League and the top four from the Championship, whilst the third will feature the remaining eight Championship sides. The bottom two leagues will begin as single round-robin tournaments. In The Qualifiers, the top three sides will either remain in or be promoted to Super League, with the fourth- and fifth-place teams playing the aforementioned \"Million Pound Game\" for the final Super League place. In the third league, the sides compete for the Championship Shield, with the top four teams after the round-robin phase entering a knockout playoff for the Shield. The bottom two teams are relegated to League 1.\nLeague 1 currently conducts a 15-match, single round-robin regular season. At that time, the league splits in two. The top eight clubs play in their own Super 8s, also contested as a single round robin. At the end of the Super 8s, the top club earns the season title and immediate promotion to the Championship. The second- through fifth-place clubs contest a knockout playoff for the second place in the Championship. The bottom eight clubs play their own single round-robin phase; at its end, the top two teams play a one-off match for the League 1 Shield.\nRugby union.\nEngland.\nPremiership.\nIn the Gallagher Premiership, the top four qualify for the play-offs, where they are not referred to by that name. The tournament is a Shaughnessy playoff: the team that finished first after the league stage plays the team that finished fourth, while the team that finished second plays the team that finished third in the Semi-Finals, with the higher-ranked team having home advantage. The winners of these semi-finals qualify for the Premiership Final at Twickenham, where the winner will be champions of the league.\nChampionship.\nThrough the 2016\u201317 season, the second-level RFU Championship used play-offs\u2014but unlike the Premiership, the Championship officially used the term \"play-offs\". At the end of the league stage, top teams advanced to a series of promotion play-offs. From the first season of the Championship in 2009\u201310 to 2011\u201312, the top eight teams advanced; from 2012\u201313 through to 2016\u201317, the top four advanced. A relegation play-off involving the bottom four teams existed through the 2011\u201312 season, but was scrapped from 2012 to 2013 on.\nThe original promotion play-offs divided the eight teams into two groups of four each, with the teams within each group playing a home-and-away mini-league. The top two teams in each group advanced to a knockout phase. In 2010, the semi-finals were one-off matches; in 2011, they became two-legged. The top team in each pool played the second-place team from the other group in the semi-finals; the winners advanced to the two-legged final, where the ultimate winner earned promotion to the Premiership (assuming that the team met the minimum criteria for promotion).\nIn the first year of the play-offs in 2010, all eight teams started equal. After that season, it was decided to reward teams for their performance in league play. in 2011 and 2012, the top two teams at the end of the league stage carried over 3\u00a0competition points to the promotion play-offs; the next two teams carried over 2; the next two carried over 1; and the final two teams carried over none. (Points were earned using the standard bonus points system.)\nThe relegation play-offs, like the first stage of the promotion play-offs, were conducted as a home-and-away league, with the bottom team at the end of league play relegated to National League 1. As with the 2010 promotion play-offs, that season's relegation play-offs started all teams equal. in 2011 and 2012, each team in the relegation play-offs carried over 1\u00a0competition point for every win in the league season.\nBeginning with the 2012\u201313 season, the pool stage of the promotion playoffs was abolished, with the top four sides directly entering the semi-finals. The format of the knockout stage remained unchanged from 2012, with two-legged semi-finals followed by a two-legged final. At the other end of the table, the bottom club is now automatically relegated.\nEffective with the 2017\u201318 season, the promotion play-offs were scrapped for a minimum of three seasons, to be replaced with automatic promotion for the club finishing atop the league at the end of the home-and-away season (provided said club meets minimum Premiership standards).\nFrance.\nThe highest level of French rugby union, the Top 14, expanded its playoffs starting with the 2009\u201310 season from a four-team format to six teams. In the new system, the top two teams after the double round-robin season receive first-round byes. The first-round matches involve the third- through sixth-place teams, bracketed so that 3 hosts 6 and 4 hosts 5. The winners then advance to face the top two teams in the semifinals, which are held at nominally neutral sites (a traditional feature in the French playoffs)\u2014although in the 2011\u201312 season, the semifinals were held at Stadium de Toulouse, occasionally used as a \"big-game\" venue by traditional Top 14 power Stade Toulousain. The winners of these semifinals qualify for the final at Stade de France (though in 2016, the final was at Camp Nou in Barcelona due to conflict with UEFA Euro 2016), where the winner will be champions of the league and receive the Bouclier de Brennus. Before 2009\u201310, the playoffs format was identical to that of the English Premiership with the exception of neutral sites for the semifinals.\nBeginning in 2017\u201318, only the bottom club is automatically relegated to Rugby Pro D2. The second-from-bottom Top 14 side plays a one-off match against the runner-up of the Pro D2 playoffs for the final place in the next Top 14 season.\nPro D2 adopted the Top 14 playoff system effective in 2017\u201318, though with all matches held at the higher seed's home field. The playoff champion earns automatic promotion; the runner-up enters a one-off match for potential promotion to Top 14. Previously, Pro D2 used a four-team playoff, involving the second- through fifth-place teams, to determine the second of two teams promoted to the next season's Top 14, with the regular-season champions earning automatic promotion. Under this system, the promotion semifinals were held at the home fields of the second- and third-place teams, and the promotion final was held at a neutral site.\nUnited Rugby Championship.\nThe United Rugby Championship (URC), originally known as the Celtic League and later as Pro12 and Pro14, adopted a four-team playoff starting with the 2009\u201310 season. The format was essentially identical to that of the English Premiership. Through the 2013\u201314 season, the final was held at a ground chosen by the top surviving seed, with the caveat that the venue must have a capacity of at least 18,000. In 2012\u201313, top seed Ulster could not use its regular home ground of Ravenhill for that reason (the ground was later expanded to meet the requirement). The league changed to using a predetermined site for its championship final in 2014\u201315.\nWith the addition of two South African sides in 2017\u201318, the league split into two conferences and expanded its playoffs to six teams. The top team of each conference earns a bye into the semifinals, where they will host the winners of matches between the second- and third-place teams from the other conferences (with the second-place team hosting the third-place team from the opposite conference).\nAfter the 2020\u201321 season, both South African sides left the league and were replaced by the country's four former Super Rugby franchises, with the competition being rebranded as the URC. The league split into four regionally based pools\u2014one each for Ireland, South Africa, and Wales, plus a joint Italian\u2013Scottish pool. While the top team of each pool at the end of the regular season will receive a trophy branded as a regional \"Shield\" and automatic qualification for the following season's European Rugby Champions Cup, all teams are combined into a single table for purposes of playoff qualification. The top eight teams advance to knockout playoffs, with the higher seed hosting all matches leading up to the championship final, which continues to be held at a predetermined site.\nNew Zealand.\nBoth domestic competitions in New Zealand rugby \u2014 the semi-professional National Provincial Championship (known by several sponsored names) and the nominally amateur Heartland Championship \u2014 use a playoff system to determine their champions, although the term \"playoff\" is also not used in New Zealand, with \"finals\" used instead.\nNational Provincial Championship.\nIn the 2006 Air New Zealand Cup, the first season of the revamped domestic structure in that country, the top six teams after Round One of the competition automatically qualified for the finals, officially known as Round Three. Their relative seeding was determined by their standings at the end of the Top Six phase of Round Two. The teams that finished below the top six entered repechage pools in Round Two, with the winner of each pool taking up one of the final two finals slots. The seventh seed was the repechage winner with the better record, and the eighth seed was the other repechage winner.\nFrom 2007 onward, the former Rounds One and Two were collapsed into a single pool phase of play in which all teams participated. In 2007 and 2008, the top eight teams advanced to the playoffs; in what was intended to be the final season of the Air New Zealand Cup format in 2009, the Shaughnessy format was used, with the top four advancing to the finals. The New Zealand Rugby Union (NZRU) ultimately decided to stay with the previous format for the rebranded 2010 ITM Cup, with the same four-team playoff as in 2009. Starting in 2011, the NZRU split the ITM Cup into two seven-team leagues, the top-level Premiership and second-level Championship, and instituted promotion and relegation in the ITM Cup (a feature of the country's former National Provincial Championship). The competition was renamed the Mitre 10 Cup in 2016.\nThe playoffs in each season format have consisted of a single-elimination tournament. The teams are bracketed in the normal fashion, with the higher seed receiving home-field advantage. In 2007 and 2008, the playoff was rebracketed after the quarterfinals, with the highest surviving seed hosting the lowest surviving seed and the second-highest surviving seed hosting the third surviving seed. The winners of these semifinals qualify for the Cup Final (2006\u201310) or Premiership/Championship Final (2011\u2013), held at the home ground of the higher surviving seed. From 2011 onward, the winner of the Championship Final is promoted to the Premiership, replacing that league's bottom team.\nBecause the 2011 season ran up against that year's Rugby World Cup in New Zealand, the competition window was truncated, with only the top two teams in each division advancing to the final match. The Shaughnessy finals series returned to both divisions in 2012, and is currently used in non-World Cup years.\nHeartland Championship.\nIn the Heartland Championship, teams play for two distinct trophies \u2014 the more prestigious Meads Cup and the Lochore Cup. The 12 Heartland Championship teams are divided into two pools for round-robin play in Round One, with the top three in each pool advancing to the Meads Cup and the bottom three dropping to the Lochore Cup.\nRound Two in both the Meads and Lochore Cups is an abbreviated round-robin tournament, with each team playing only the teams it did not play in Round One. The top four teams in the Meads Cup pool at the end of Round Two advance to the Meads Cup semifinals; the same applies for the Lochore Cup contestants.\nThe semifinals of both cups are seeded 1 vs 4 and 2 vs 3, with the higher seeds earning home field advantage. The semifinal winners advance to their respective cup final, hosted by the higher surviving seed.\nSuper Rugby.\nThroughout the pre-2011 history of Super Rugby\u2014both in the Super 12 and Super 14 formats\u2014the competition's organiser, SANZAR (renamed SANZAAR in 2016), held a Shaughnessy playoff involving the top four teams. The top two teams on the league ladder each hosted a semifinal, with the top surviving team hosting the final.\nIn May 2009, SANZAR announced that it would adopt an expanded playoff when the competition added a new Australian team for the 2011 season. Through 2015, the Super Rugby playoff involved six teams\u2014the winners of each of three conferences (Australia, New Zealand and South Africa conferences), plus the three non-winners with the most competition points without regard to conference affiliation.\nThe top two conference winners received a first-round bye; each played at home against the winner of an elimination match involving two of the four other playoff teams. As in the previous system, the final was hosted by the top surviving seed.\nFurther expansion of the competition in 2016 to 18 teams, with one extra entry from South Africa and new teams based in Argentina and Japan, saw the playoff bracket expand to eight teams. The teams were split into African and Australasian groups, with the Argentine and Japanese teams joining the African group. Each group in turn was divided into two conferences (Australia, New Zealand, Africa 1, Africa 2). Conference winners received the top four playoff seeds, and were joined by the top three remaining Australasian teams and the top remaining team from the African group on table points, again without regard to conference affiliation. The higher seed still hosted all playoff matches, including the final.\nWith the contraction of the league to 15 teams for 2018, with one Australian and two South African teams being axed, the playoff format changed yet again. The number of conferences was reduced from four to three\u2014Australia, New Zealand and South Africa, with the Argentine team joining the South Africa conference and the Japanese team joining the Australia conference. The playoff will remain at eight teams, with the three conference winners joined by five \"wildcards\", specifically the top remaining teams without regard to conference affiliation. The conference winners and the top wildcard will host quarterfinals, with all remaining matches hosted by the higher seed.\nSummary.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He is described as made of stone and is ultimately killed in a duel with the thunder god Thor.\nPrior to his demise, Hrungnir engaged in a wager with Odin in which Odin stakes his head on his horse, Sleipnir, being faster than Hrungnir's steed Gullfaxi. During the race, which Sleipnir wins, Hrungnir enters \u00c1sgard, and there becomes drunk and abusive. After they grow weary of him, the gods call on the god Thor to battle Hrungnir. He is slain by Thor's hammer Mj\u00f6lnir.\nHrungnir is comparable to the Hurrian Ullikummi, a stone-giant who grew so quickly that he reached the heavens. He was slain by the thunder-god Teshub who is equivalent also to the Luwian Tar\u1e2bunz and Hittite Tar\u1e2bunna.\nName.\nThe Old Norse name Hrungnir has been translated as 'brawler', or as 'big person, strong man', 'noise-maker'.\nAttestations.\nProse Edda.\nIn \"Sk\u00e1ldskaparm\u00e1l\" (The Language of Poetry), written in the 13th century CE by Snorri Sturluson, the god Odin is portrayed as riding his horse Sleipnir into J\u00f6tunheim when he meets the j\u00f6tunn Hrungnir, mounted on his horse Gullfaxi (Gold-mane). They have a short verbal exchange about the quality of their respective horse, during which Odin states his willingness to bet his head (his life) on the result. Hrungnir declares that he has \"a horse that must be much longe-paced, it [is] called Gullfaxi.\" Then Hrungnir gets angry, leaps upon his horse and follows Odin in a race towards \u00c1sgard, \"intending to pay him back for his boasting\". Although Sleipnir turns out to be the fastest horse, the race is very close and Odin is not able to keep Hrungnir out of the place of gods, \u00c1sgard. There, the \u00c6sir (gods) invites Hrungnir for a drink. \nHrungnir becomes so intoxicated that he threatens to remove \"Val-hall and take it to Giantland\" and to \"bury Asgard and kill all the gods\", besides the beautiful goddesses Freyja and Sif whom he intends to keep for himself. The gods then call the thunder-god Thor to expel the unwanted guest, and the two of them agree to a duel. Thor arrives at the appointment with his servant \u00dej\u00e1lfi, and Hrungnir is escorted by Mokkurk\u00e1lfi ('Mist-calf'), a mighty creature made of clay, and with the heart of a mare. But the giant Mokkurk\u00e1lfi is said to be \"quite terrified\" and he \"wets himself\" at the sight of Thor, whereas Hrungnir, whose heart, head and shield appear to be made of stone, is \"standing unguardedly\". After the fight is over and Hrungnir eventually defeated, Thor turns out to be stuck under the j\u00f6tunn's leg. Thor's three-year-old son Magni is the only one able to lift up the gigantic leg among all the present \u00c6sir (gods). As a reward, Thor offers him Hrungnir's horse Gullfaxi.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\u2014\u200a\nSkaldic poetry.\n\"Haustl\u00f6ng\" (Autumn-long, ), a poem written by the early 10th-century skald \u00dej\u00f3\u00f0\u00f3lfr of Hvinir and from which Snorri claims to derive his own account, depicts Thor's journey to the duel while the cosmological elements are reacting: the \"ground all low\" (earth) is \"battered with hail\" and \"all the hawk's sanctuaries\" (the skies) are in flame; \"Svolnir\u2019s widow\" (Odin's consort, J\u00f6r\u00f0 [Earth]) practically split apart\". Then Hrungnir and Thor fight by hurling their weapons at each other (the j\u00f6tunn's whetstone and Thor's hammer), and the poem alludes to the removal of the piece of whetstone from Thor's head.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\u2014\u200a\nCompared to Snorri's account, \u00dej\u00f3\u00f0\u00f3lfr emphasizes more on Thor's journey to the battle, escorted by noise and flames, while Snorri makes relatively little of it and also describes Hrungnir's journey. Thor's servant \u00dej\u00e1lfi and Hrungnir's clay-made giant Mokkurk\u00e1lfi are absent from \u00dej\u00f3\u00f0\u00f3lfr\u2019s 10th-century version.\nIn \"Ragnarsdr\u00e1pa\", the 9th-century skald Bragi Boddason mentions \"Hrungnir's skull-splitter\".\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\u2014\u200a\nBragi also refers to the shield as \"Hrungnir's sole-blade\" and refers to Hrungnir as the \"thief of \u00der\u00fa\u00f0r\", the daughter of Thor.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\u2014\u200a\nTheories.\nAccording to scholar John Lindow, the reaction of cosmological elements (the earth is cracking, the sky burning) during Thor's journey to the battle, as told in \"Haustl\u00f6ng\", \"suggests the cosmic nature of Thor\u2019s duel with Hrungnir\". The motivation for the duel, which is not mentioned by 10th-century skald \u00dej\u00f3\u00f0\u00f3lfr in \"Haustl\u00f6ng\", could have originally been the abduction of Thor's daughter \u00der\u00fa\u00f0r by the stone-made giant Hrungnir, as suggested by an earlier kenning by 9th-century skald Bragi: 'leaf of the soles of the thief of \u00der\u00fa\u00f0r [SHIELD]' (\"bla\u00f0 ilja \u00der\u00fa\u00f0ar \u00fej\u00f3fs\").\nGeorges Dum\u00e9zil argues that the story involves the initiation of \u00dej\u00e1lfi by Thor in the killing of the clay-made monster.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "74681", "revid": "18186449", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=74681", "title": "Palestinian refugees", "text": "Displaced persons and refugees\nPalestinian refugees are citizens of Mandatory Palestine, and their descendants, who fled or were expelled from their country, village or house over the course of the 1948 Palestine war and during the 1967 Six-Day War. Most Palestinian refugees live in or near 68 Palestinian refugee camps across Jordan, Lebanon, Syria, the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, and make up a large proportion of the Palestinian people. In 2019 more than 5.6 million Palestinian refugees were registered with the United Nations.\nIn 1949, the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) defined Palestinian refugees to refer to the original \"Palestine refugees\" as well as their patrilineal descendants. However, UNRWA's assistance is limited to Palestine refugees residing in UNRWA's areas of operation in the Palestinian Territories, Lebanon, Jordan and Syria.\nAs of 2019, more than 5.6 million Palestinians were registered with UNRWA as refugees, of which more than 1.5 million live in UNRWA-run camps. The term \"Palestine refugee\" does not include internally displaced Palestinians, who became Israeli citizens, or displaced Palestinian Jews. According to some estimates, as many as 1,050,000\u20131,380,000 people, who descend from displaced people of Mandatory Palestine are not registered under UNRWA or UNHCR mandates.\nDuring the 1948 Palestine War, around 85% of the population or 700,000 Palestinian Arabs, living in the area that became Israel fled or were expelled from their homes, to the West Bank, the Gaza Strip, and to the countries of Lebanon, Syria and Jordan. They, and their descendants who are also entitled to registration, are assisted by UNWRA in 59 registered camps, ten of which were established in the aftermath of the Six-Day War in 1967 to cope with the new wave of displaced Palestinians. They are also the world's oldest unsettled refugee population, having been under the ongoing governance of Arab states following the 1948 Arab\u2013Israeli War, the refugee populations of the West Bank under Israeli governance since the Six-Day War and Palestinian administration since 1994, and the Gaza Strip administered by the Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) since 2007.\nToday, the largest number of refugees, over 2,000,000, live in Jordan, where by 2009 over 90% of UNWRA-registered Palestinian refugees had acquired full citizenship rights. This figure consists almost exclusively of West Bank\u2013descended Palestinians; however, as of December 2021, Palestinians with roots in the Gaza Strip are also still kept in legal limbo. In 2021, Jordanian politician Jawad Anani estimated that roughly 50% of Jordan's population had West Bank\u2013Palestinian roots. Another approximately 2,000,000 refugees live in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, under Israeli occupation and blockade. Approximately 500,000 refugees live in each of Syria and Lebanon respectively, albeit under very different circumstances. While Palestinian refugees in Syria maintained their stateless status, the Syrian government during Assad's rule afforded them the same economic and social rights enjoyed by Syrian citizens; they were also drafted into the Armed Forces despite not being citizens. Citizenship or legal residency in some host countries is denied, most notably for the Palestinian refugees in Lebanon, where the absorption of Palestinians would upset a delicate confessional balance. For the refugees themselves, these situations mean they have reduced rights: no right to vote, limited property rights and access to social services, among other things.\nOn 11 December 1948, the General Assembly of the United Nations (UNGA) adopted Resolution 194 which affirmed the Palestinians right to return to their homes.\nDefinitions.\nUNRWA.\nThe United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) is an organ of the United Nations created exclusively for the purpose of aiding those displaced by the Arab\u2013Israeli conflict, with an annual budget of approximately $600 million. It defines a \"Palestine refugee\" as a person \"whose normal place of residence was Mandatory Palestine between June 1946 and May 1948, who lost both their homes and means of livelihood as a result of the 1948 Arab\u2013Israeli conflict\". The Six-Day War of 1967 generated a new wave of Palestinian refugees who could not be included in the original UNRWA definition. From 1991, the UN General Assembly has adopted an annual resolution allowing the 1967 refugees within the UNRWA mandate. UNRWA aids all \"those living in its area of operations who meet its working definition, who are registered with the Agency and who need assistance\" and those who first became refugees as a result of the Six-Day War, regardless whether they reside in areas designated as Palestine refugee camps or in other permanent communities.\nA Palestine refugee camp is \"a plot of land placed at the disposal of UNRWA by the host government to accommodate Palestine refugees and to set up facilities to cater to their needs\". About 1.4 million of registered Palestine refugees, approximately one-third, live in the 58 UNRWA-recognised refugee camps in Jordan, Lebanon, Syria, the Gaza Strip and the West Bank. The UNRWA definition does not cover final status.\nRegistered descendants of UNRWA Palestine refugees, like \"Nansen passport\" and \"Certificate of Eligibility\" holders (the documents issued to those displaced by World War II) or like UNHCR refugees, inherit the same Palestine refugee status as their male parent. According to UNRWA, \"The descendants of Palestine refugee males, including adopted children, are also eligible for registration.\"\nThe UNHCR had counted 90,000 refugees by 2014.\nPalestinian definitions.\nPalestinians make several distinctions relating to Palestinian refugees. The 1948 refugees and their descendants are broadly defined as \"refugees\" (\"laji'un\"). The Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), especially those who have returned and form part of the PNA, but also Palestinian refugee camp residents in Lebanon, repudiate this term, since it implies being a passive victim, and prefer the autonym of 'returnees' (\"a'idun\"). Those who left since 1967, and their descendants, are called \"nazihun\" or \"displaced persons\", though many may also descend from the 1948 group.\nOrigin of the Palestine refugees.\nMost Palestinian refugees have retained their refugee status and continue to reside in refugee camps, including within the State of Palestine in the West Bank and in the Gaza Strip. Their descendants form a sizable portion of the Palestinian diaspora.\nPalestinian refugees from the 1948 Palestine War.\nDuring the 1948 Palestine War, some 700,000 Palestinian Arabs or 85% of the Palestinian Arab population of territories that became Israel fled or were expelled from their homes. Some 30,000 to 50,000 were alive by 2012.\nThe causes and responsibilities of the exodus are a matter of controversy among historians and commentators of the conflict. While historians agree on most of the events of the period, there remains disagreement as to whether the exodus was the result of a plan designed before or during the war or was an unintended consequence of the war. According to historian Benny Morris, the expulsion was planned and encouraged by the Zionist leadership.\nAccording to Morris, between December 1947 and March 1948, around 100,000 Palestine Arabs fled. Among them were many from the higher and middle classes from the cities, who left voluntarily, expecting to return when the Arab states won the war and took control of the country. When the Haganah and then the emerging Israeli army (Israel Defense Forces or IDF) went on the defensive, between April and July, a further 250,000 to 300,000 Palestinian Arabs left or were expelled, mainly from the towns of Haifa, Tiberias, Beit-Shean, Safed, Jaffa and Acre, which lost more than 90 percent of their Arab inhabitants. Expulsions took place in many towns and villages, particularly along the Tel Aviv\u2013Jerusalem road and in Eastern Galilee. About 50,000\u201370,000 inhabitants of Lydda and Ramle were expelled towards Ramallah by the IDF during Operation Danny, and most others during operations of the IDF in its rear areas. During Operation Dekel, the Arabs of Nazareth and South Galilee were allowed to remain in their homes. Today they form the core of the Arab Israeli population. From October to November 1948, the IDF launched Operation Yoav to remove Egyptian forces from the Negev and Operation Hiram to remove the Arab Liberation Army from North Galilee during which at least nine events named massacres of Arabs were carried out by IDF soldiers. These events generated an exodus of 200,000 to 220,000 Palestinian Arabs. Here, Arabs fled fearing atrocities or were expelled if they had not fled. After the war, from 1948 to 1950, the IDF resettled around 30,000 to 40,000 Arabs from the borderlands of the new Israeli state.\nPalestinian refugees from Six-Day War.\nAs a result of the Six-Day War, around 280,000 to 325,000 Palestinians fled or were expelled from the territories conquered in the Six-Day War by Israel, including the demolished Palestinian villages of Imwas, Yalo, Bayt Nuba, Surit, Beit Awwa, Beit Mirsem, Shuyukh, Jiftlik, Agarith and Huseirat, and the \"emptying\" of the refugee camps of Aqabat Jabr and Ein as-Sultan.\nPalestinian exodus from Kuwait (Gulf War).\nThe Palestinian exodus from Kuwait took place during and after the Gulf War. During the Gulf War, more than 200,000 Palestinians voluntarily fled Kuwait during the Iraqi occupation of Kuwait due to harassment and intimidation by Iraqi security forces, in addition to getting fired from work by Iraqi authority figures in Kuwait. After the Gulf War, Kuwaiti authorities forcibly pressured nearly 200,000 Palestinians to leave Kuwait in 1991. Kuwait's policy, which led to this exodus, was a response to alignment of Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) with the dictator Saddam Hussein, who had earlier invaded Kuwait.\nPrior to the Gulf War, Palestinians numbered 400,000 out of Kuwait's population of 2.2 million. The Palestinians who fled Kuwait were Jordanian citizens. In 2013, there were 280,000 Jordanian citizens of Palestinian origin in Kuwait. In 2012, 80,000 Palestinians (without Jordanian citizenship) lived in Kuwait. In total, there are 360,000 Palestinians in Kuwait as of 2012\u20132013.\nPalestinian refugees as part of the Syrian refugee crisis.\nMany Palestinians in Syria were displaced as a result of the Syrian Civil War starting in 2011. By October 2013, 235,000 Palestinians had been displaced within Syria itself and 60,000 (alongside 2.2 million Syrians) had fled the country. By March 2019, the UHCR estimated that 120,000 Palestine refugees had fled Syria since 2011, primarily to Lebanon and Jordan, but also Turkey and further afield.\nThere were reports that Jordan and Lebanon had turned away Palestinian refugees attempting to flee the humanitarian crises in Syria. By 2013, Jordan had absorbed 126,000 Syrian refugees but Palestinians fleeing Syria were placed in a separate refugee camp under stricter conditions and banned from entering Jordanian cities.\nPalestinian refugees from Syria also sought asylum in Europe, especially Sweden, which had offered asylum to any Syrian refugees that managed to reach its territory, albeit with some conditions. Many did so by finding their way to Egypt and making the journey by sea. In October 2013, the PFLP-GC claimed that some 23,000 Palestinian refugees from the Yarmouk Camp alone had immigrated to Sweden.\nPalestinian refugees during the 2023 Israel\u2013Gaza war.\nAs of January 2024, more than 85% of Palestinians in Gaza, approximately 1.9 million people, were internally displaced during the Gaza war. Some wounded Palestinians from Gaza were allowed to leave for Egypt. As of 2025, there are over 100,000 Gazan refugees living in Egypt.\nRefugee statistics.\nThe number of Palestine refugees varies depending on the source. For 1948\u201349 refugees, for example, the Israeli government suggests a number as low as 520,000 as opposed to 850,000 by their Palestinian counterparts. As of January 2015, UNRWA cites 5,149,742 registered refugees in total, of whom 1,603,018 are registered in camps.\nThe number of UNRWA registered Palestine refugees by country or territory in January 2015 were as follows:\nGaza Strip.\nAs of January 2015, the Gaza Strip has 8 UNRWA refugee camps with 560,964 Palestinian refugees, and 1,276,929 registered refugees in total, out of a population of 1,816,379.\nWest Bank.\nAs of January 2015, the West Bank has 19 UNRWA refugee camps with 228,560 Palestinian refugees, and 774,167 registered refugees in total, out of a population of 2,345,107.\nJordan.\n\"More than 2 million registered Palestine refugees live in Jordan. Most Palestine refugees in Jordan, but not all, have full citizenship\", following Jordan's annexation and occupation of the West Bank. The percentage of Palestinian refugees living in refugee camps to those who settled outside the camps is the lowest of all UNRWA fields of operations. Palestine refugees are allowed access to public services and healthcare, as a result, refugee camps are becoming more like poor city suburbs than refugee camps. Most Palestine refugees moved out of the camps to other parts of the country and the number of people registered in refugee camps as of January 2015 is 385,418, who live in ten refugee camps. This caused UNRWA to reduce the budget allocated to Palestine refugee camps in Jordan. Former UNRWA chief-attorney James G. Lindsay wrote in 2009: \"In Jordan, where 2 million Palestinian refugees live, all but 167,000 have citizenship, and are fully eligible for government services including education and health care.\" Lindsay suggests that eliminating services to refugees whose needs are subsidized by Jordan \"would reduce the refugee list by 40%\".\nPalestinians who moved from the West Bank (whether refugees or not) to Jordan, are issued yellow-ID cards to distinguish them from the Palestinians of the \"official 10 refugee camps\" in Jordan. From 1988 to 2012, thousands of those yellow-ID card Palestinians had their Jordanian citizenship revoked. Human Rights Watch estimated that about 2,700 Palestinians were stripped of Jordanian nationality between 2004 and 2008. In 2012, the Jordanian government promised to stop revoking the citizenship of some Palestinians, and restored citizenship to 4,500 Palestinians who had previously lost it.\nLebanon.\n100,000 Palestinians fled to Lebanon because of the 1948 Arab\u2013Israeli War and were not allowed to return. As of January 2015, there were 452,669 registered refugees in Lebanon.\nIn a 2007 study, Amnesty International denounced the \"appalling social and economic condition\" of Palestinians in Lebanon. Until 2005, Palestinians were forbidden to work in over 70 jobs because they do not have Lebanese citizenship, but this was later reduced to around 20 as of 2007 after liberalization laws. In 2010, Palestinians were granted the same rights to work as other foreigners in the country.\nLebanon gave citizenship to about 50,000 Christian Palestinian refugees during the 1950s and 1960s. In the mid-1990s, about 60,000 Shiite Muslim refugees were granted citizenship. This caused a protest from Maronite authorities, leading to citizenship being given to all Christian refugees who were not already citizens.\nIn the 2010s, many Palestinian refugees in Lebanon began immigrating to Europe, both legally and illegally, as part of the European migrant crisis, due to a deterioration in living conditions there as part of the Syrian civil war. In December 2015, sources told \"Al Jazeera\" that thousands of Palestinians were fleeing to Europe by way of Turkey, with about 4,000 having fled the Ain al-Hilweh camp alone in recent months. Many were reaching Germany, with others going to Russia, Sweden, Belgium, and Norway. A census completed in January 2018 found that only around 175,000 Palestinian refugees were living in Lebanon, as opposed to previous UNRWA figures which put the number at between 400,000 and 500,000, as well as other estimates that placed the number between 260,000 and 280,000.\nAccording to writer and researcher Mudar Zahran, a Jordanian of Palestinian heritage, the media chose to deliberately ignore the conditions of the Palestinians living in Lebanese refugee camps, and that the \"tendency to blame Israel for everything\" has provided Arab leaders with an excuse to deliberately ignore the human rights of the Palestinian in their countries.\nSyria.\nSyria had 528,616 registered Palestinian refugees in January 2015. There were 9 UNRWA refugee camps with 178,666 official Palestinian refugees.\nAs a result of the Syrian civil war, large numbers of Palestinian refugees fled Syria to Europe as part of the European migrant crisis, and to other Arab countries. In September 2015, a Palestinian official said that only 200,000 Palestinian refugees were left in Syria, with 100,000 Palestinian refugees from Syria in Europe and the remainder in other Arab countries.\nSaudi Arabia.\nAn estimated 240,000 Palestinians are living in Saudi Arabia.\nIraq.\nThere were 34,000 Palestinian refugees living in Iraq prior to the Iraq War. In the aftermath of the war, the majority fled to neighboring Jordan and Syria, or were killed. Thousands lived as internally displaced persons within Iraq or were stranded in camps along Iraq's borders with Jordan and Syria, as no country in the region would accept them, and lived in temporary camps along the no man's land in the border zones.\nOther countries.\nIndia agreed to take in 165 refugees, with the first group arriving in March 2006. Generally, they were unable to find work in India as they spoke only Arabic though some found employment with UNHCR's non-governmental partners. All of them were provided with free access to public hospitals. Of the 165 refugees, 137 of them later found clearance for resettlement in Sweden. In November 2006, 54 were granted asylum in Canada, and in 2007, some 200 were accepted for resettlement in Sweden and Iceland, and Brazil agreed to take 100.\nIn 2009, significant numbers of these refugees were allowed to resettle abroad. More than 1,000 were accepted by various countries in Europe and South America, and an additional 1,350 were cleared for resettlement in the United States. Another 68 were allowed to resettle in Australia. However, the majority of Palestine refugees strongly oppose resettlement and much rather want to return to their homes in the region of Palestine.\nPositions.\nOn 11 December 1948 the United Nations General Assembly discussed Bernadotte's report and passed a resolution: \"that refugees wishing to return to their homes and live at peace with their neighbour should be permitted to do so at the earliest practicable date.\" This General Assembly article 11 of Resolution 194 has been annually re-affirmed.\nIsraeli views.\nThe Jewish Agency promised to the UN before 1948 that Palestinian Arabs would become full citizens of the State of Israel, and the Israeli declaration of independence invited the Arab inhabitants of Israel to \"full and equal citizenship\". In practice, Israel does not grant citizenship to the refugees, as it does to those Arabs who continue to reside in its borders. The 1947 Partition Plan determined citizenship based on residency, such that Arabs and Jews residing in Palestine but not in Jerusalem would obtain citizenship in the state in which they are resident. Professor of Law at Boston University Susan Akram, Omar Barghouti and Ilan Papp\u00e9 have argued that Palestinian refugees from the envisioned Jewish State were entitled to normal Israeli citizenship based on laws of state succession.\nFollowing the Six-Day War in 1967, Israel gained control over a substantial number of refugee camps in the territories it captured from Egypt and Jordan. The Israeli government attempted to resettle them permanently by initiating a subsidized \"build-your-own home\" program. Israel provided land for refugees who chose to participate; the Palestinians bought building materials on credit and built their own houses, usually with friends. Israel provided the new neighborhoods with necessary services, such as schools and sewers. The United Nations General Assembly passed Resolutions 31/15 and 34/52, which condemned the program as a violation of the refugees' \"inalienable right of return\", and called upon Israel to stop the program. Thousands of refugees were resettled into various neighborhoods, but the program was suspended due to pressure from the PLO.\nArab states.\nMost Palestinian refugees live either in the West Bank or Gaza Strip, or the three original \"host countries\" of Jordan, Lebanon and Syria who unwillingly accepted the first wave of refugees in 1948; these refugees are supported by UNRWA. The small number of refugees who settled in Egypt or Iraq were supported directly by those countries' governments. Over the last seven decades, a number of refugees have migrated to other Arab states, particularly the Arab states of the Gulf, primarily as economic migrants.\nArab states' view of Palestinian refugees has varied over time. Arab governments have often supported the refugees in the name of Arab unity, or because they viewed the Palestinians as an important source of skilled human capital to support their economic development. However, Arab governments have also frequently \"despised\" the Palestinian refugees \u2013 either viewing them as a threat to demographic balance (as in Lebanon), or because of the \"political message of freedom and emancipation that their \u2018Palestinian-ness\u2019 carried\", or else because in some countries' history Palestinians have been \"somewhat associated with strife and unrest\".\nPalestinian refugees have taken citizenship in other Arab states, most notably in Jordan. However, the conferring of citizenship is a sensitive topic, as \"it is often perceived as allowing Israel to evade its responsibility towards the refugees\". On 17 October 2023 during the Gaza war, Jordan's king Abdullah warned against pushing refugees into Egypt or Jordan, adding that the humanitarian situation must to be dealt with inside Gaza and the West Bank: \"That is a red line, because I think that is the plan by certain of the usual suspects to try and create de facto issues on the ground. No refugees in Jordan, no refugees in Egypt.\"\nTashbih Sayyed, a fellow of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, criticized Arab nations of violating human rights and making the children and grandchildren of Palestinian refugees second class citizens in Lebanon, Syria, or the Gulf States, and said that the UNRWA Palestine refugees \"cling to the illusion that defeating the Jews will restore their dignity\".\nPalestinian views.\nMost Palestine refugees claim a Palestinian right of return. In lack of an own country, their claim is based on Article 13 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR), which declares that \"Everyone has the right to leave any country including his own, and to return to his country\", although it has been argued that the term only applies to citizens or nationals of that country. Although all Arab League members at the time (1948) \u2013 Egypt, Iraq, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, Syria, and Yemen \u2013 voted against the resolution, they also cite the article 11 of United Nations General Assembly Resolution 194, which \"Resolves that the refugees wishing to return to their homes and live at peace with their neighbors should be permitted to do so at the earliest practicable date, and that compensation should be paid for the property of those choosing not to return [...].\" However it is currently a matter of dispute whether Resolution 194 referred only to the estimated 50,000 remaining Palestine refugees from the 1948 Palestine War, or additionally to their UNRWA-registered 4,950,000 descendants. The Palestinian National Authority supports this claim, and has been prepared to negotiate its implementation at the various peace talks. Both Fatah and Hamas hold a strong position for a claimed \"right of return\", with Fatah being prepared to give ground on the issue while Hamas is not.\nHowever, a report in Lebanon's Daily Star newspaper in which Abdullah Muhammad Ibrahim Abdullah, the Palestinian ambassador to Lebanon and the chairman of the Palestinian Legislative Council's Political and Parliamentary Affairs committees, said the proposed future Palestinian state would not be issuing Palestinian passports to UNRWA Palestine refugees \u2013 even refugees living in the West Bank and Gaza.\nAn independent poll by Khalil Shikaki was conducted in 2003 with 4,500 Palestinian refugee families of Gaza, West Bank, Jordan and Lebanon. It showed that the majority (54%) would accept a financial compensation and a place to live in West Bank or Gaza in place of returning to the exact place in modern-day Israel where they or their ancestors lived (this possibility of settlement is contemplated in the Resolution 194). Only 10% said they would live in Israel if given the option. The other third said they would prefer to live in other countries, or rejected the terms described. However, the poll has been criticized as \"methodologically problematic\" and \"rigged\". In 2003, nearly a hundred refugee organizations and NGOs in Lebanon denounced Shikaki's survey, as no local organization was aware of its implementation in Lebanon.\nIn a 2 January 2005 opinion poll conducted by the Palestinian Association for Human Rights involving Palestinian refugees in Lebanon:\nThe Oslo Accords.\nUpon signing the Oslo Accords in 1993, Israel, the EU and the US recognized PLO as the legitimate representative of the Palestinian people. In return, Yasser Arafat recognized the State of Israel and renounced terrorism. At the time, the accords were celebrated as a historic breakthrough. In accordance with these agreements, the Palestinian refugees began to be governed by an autonomous Palestinian Authority, and the parties agreed to negotiate the permanent status of the refugees, as early as 1996. However, events have halted the phasing process and made the likelihood of a future sovereign Palestinian state uncertain. In another development, a rift developed between Fatah in the West-Bank and Hamas in Gaza after Hamas won the 2006 elections. Among other differences, Fatah officially recognizes the Oslo Accords with Israel, whereas Hamas does not.\nUnited States.\nAs of May 2012, the United States Senate Appropriations Committee approved a definition of a Palestine refugee to include only those original Palestine refugees who were actually displaced between June 1946 and May 1948, resulting in an estimated number of 30,000.\nReferences.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\nBooks.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nOther.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Presper Eckert", "text": "American electrical engineer and computer pioneer (1919\u20131995)\nJohn Adam Presper \"Pres\" Eckert Jr. (April 9, 1919 \u2013 June 3, 1995) was an American electrical engineer and computer pioneer. With John Mauchly, he designed the first general-purpose electronic digital computer (ENIAC), presented the first course in computing topics (the Moore School Lectures), founded the Eckert\u2013Mauchly Computer Corporation, and designed the first commercial computer in the U.S., the UNIVAC, which incorporated Eckert's invention of the mercury delay-line memory.\nEducation.\nEckert was born in Philadelphia to Ethel M. Hallowell, who came from an old Philadelphia Quaker family, and John Eckert, a wealthy real estate developer of Swiss German and Alsatian descent. He was raised in a large house in Philadelphia's Germantown section. During elementary school, he was driven by chauffeur to William Penn Charter School, and in high school joined the Engineer's Club of Philadelphia and spent afternoons at the electronics laboratory of television inventor Philo Farnsworth in Chestnut Hill. He placed second in the country on the math portion of the College Board examination.\nEckert initially enrolled in the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School to study business at the encouragement of his parents, but in 1937 transferred to Penn's Moore School of Electrical Engineering. In 1940, at age 21, Eckert applied for his first patent, \"Light Modulating Method and Apparatus\". At the Moore School, Eckert participated in research on radar timing, made improvements to the speed and precision of the Moore School's differential analyzer, and in 1941 assisted in teaching a summer course in electronics under the Engineering, Science, and Management War Training (ESMWT) offered through the Moore School by the United States Department of War.\nDevelopment of ENIAC.\nJohn Mauchly, then chairman of the physics department of nearby Ursinus College, was a student in the summer electronics course, and the following fall secured a teaching position at the Moore School. Mauchly's proposal for building an electronic digital computer using vacuum tubes, many times faster and more accurate than the differential analyzer for computing ballistics tables for artillery, caught the interest of the Moore School's Army liaison, Lieutenant Herman Goldstine, and on April 9, 1943, was formally presented in a meeting at Aberdeen Proving Ground to director Colonel Leslie Simon, Oswald Veblen, and others. A contract was awarded for Moore School's construction of the proposed computing machine, which would be named ENIAC, and Eckert was made the project's chief engineer. ENIAC was completed in late 1945 and was unveiled to the public in February 1946.\nEntrepreneurship.\nBoth Eckert and Mauchly left the Moore School in March 1946 over a dispute involving assignment of claims on intellectual property developed at the university. In that year, the University of Pennsylvania adopted a new patent policy to protect the intellectual purity of the research it sponsored, which would have required Eckert and Mauchly to assign all their patents to the university had they stayed beyond March.\nEckert and Mauchly's agreement with the University of Pennsylvania was that Eckert and Mauchly retained the patent rights to the ENIAC but the university could license it to the government and non-profit organizations. The university wanted to change the agreement so that they would also have commercial rights to the patent.\nIn the following months, Eckert and Mauchly started up the Electronic Control Company which built the Binary Automatic Computer (BINAC). One of the major advances of this machine, which was used from August 1950, was that data was stored on magnetic tape. The Electronic Control Company soon became the Eckert\u2013Mauchly Computer Corporation, and it received an order from the National Bureau of Standards to build the Universal Automatic Computer (UNIVAC). Eckert was awarded the Howard N. Potts Medal in 1949. In 1950, Eckert\u2013Mauchly Computer Corporation ran into financial troubles and was acquired by Remington Rand Corporation. The UNIVAC I was finished on December 21, 1950.\nIn 1968, \"For pioneering and continuing contributions in creating, developing, and improving the high-speed electronic digital computer\", Eckert was awarded the National Medal of Science.\nLater career.\nEckert remained with Remington Rand and became an executive within the company. He continued with Remington Rand as it merged with the Burroughs Corporation to become Unisys in 1986. In 1989, Eckert retired from Unisys but continued to act as a consultant for the company. He died of leukemia in Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania.\nIn 2002, he was inducted, posthumously, into the National Inventors Hall of Fame.\n\"Eckert architecture\".\nEckert believed that the widely adopted term \"von Neumann architecture\" should properly be known as the \"Eckert architecture\", since the stored-program concept central to the von Neumann architecture had already been developed at the Moore School by the time von Neumann arrived on the scene in 1944\u20131945. Eckert's contention that von Neumann improperly took credit for devising the stored-program computer architecture was supported by Jean Bartik, one of the original ENIAC programmers.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

According to the \"Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica\", \"Her work has been praised for the beauty of its language and images.\"\nEarly life and education.\nAvison, the daughter of a Methodist minister, was born in Galt, Ontario, in 1918. She moved to Regina, Saskatchewan, in 1920, and Calgary, Alberta, a few years later. Her family moved again, in 1930, to Toronto, Ontario. She attended Alma College, located in St. Thomas, Ontario, ca. 1935. As a teenager she was hospitalized for anorexia.\nShe attended Victoria College at the University of Toronto, entering in 1936 and getting her B.A. in 1940 (and returning to pick up her M.A. in 1965). Before she finished her B.A. she was a published poet; the poem \"Gatineau\" appeared in the Canadian Poetry Magazine in 1939. Additionally, she began publishing poetry in the college magazine, Acta Victoriana.\nCareer.\nBesides writing poetry, Avison worked a variety of other jobs, such as working as a file clerk, proofreader, and editor. She also worked in the Registrar's Office and Library at the University of Toronto. Avison worked as a librarian, was a social worker at the Presbyterian Church Mission in Toronto, and taught at Scarborough College. She wrote most of her poetry in her spare time, and chose paying jobs which left her time to write. She didn't apply for a Canada Council grant.\nIn 1951 Avison's junior high school textbook, \"History of Ontario\", was published.\nAs mentioned previously, Avison's poem \"Gatineau\" appeared in \"Canadian Poetry Magazine\" in 1939. In 1943, anthologist A.J.M. Smith included her poetry in his \"Book of Canadian Poetry\". (In her autobiography, she mentions a \"chaste skinny dip\" with Smith.)\nIn 1956 Avison received a Guggenheim Memorial Foundation Grant; she spent eight months in the United States and was able to attend classes at the universities of Chicago and Indiana. She ghostwrote a book entitled \"A Doctor's Memoir\" and wrote her first book of poetry, \"Winter Sun.\" It was published in 1960 and won the Governor General's Award.\nAvison was moved by the Hungarian Uprising of 1956 and translated eight Hungarian poems that then appeared in \"The Plough and The Pen\" - this brought recognition to various twentieth century Hungarian poets. Avison successfully completed her M.A. at the University of Toronto, but while she began a Ph.D. she did not matriculate as she did not write a thesis.\nAvison converted to Christianity (from agnosticism) in 1963. She wrote about that experience in her second book of poetry, \"The Dumbfounding\" (1966).\nAvison taught at Scarborough Hall, University of Toronto, between 1966 and 1968, and also volunteered at Presbyterian mission named Evangel Hall during this time. Avison was writer-in-residence at the University of Western Ontario for eight months in 1973. From 1973 to 1978 she worked in the archives division of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC). In 1978 she joined Toronto's Mustard Seed Mission as a secretary, and worked there until her retirement in 1986.\nAvison became an Officer of the Order of Canada in 1984.\nHer fourth collection of poems, \"No Time\", came out in 1990, and won her a second Governor General's Award.\nIn 2003 Avison's \"Concrete and Wild Carrot\" won the Griffin Poetry Prize. \"Lauding Avison as 'a national treasure,' Griffin Poetry Prize judges praised the 'sublimity' and 'humility' of her poetry -- which they described as 'some of the most humane, sweet and profound poetry of our time.'\"\nAvison was honoured for her contributions to Canadian literature by various honorary degrees: Acadia University (1983), York University (1985), and Victoria University (1988).\nMargaret Avison died in Toronto on July 31, 2007, age 89, from undisclosed causes.\nWriting.\nAvison can be considered a spiritual or metaphysical poet; \"her work is often described by reviewers as introspective, observant, and deeply spiritual.\" \"Many critics compare her work to the great metaphysical poets of the 17th century.\"\n\"The Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica\" describes her as a \"Canadian poet who revealed the progress of an interior spiritual journey in her three successive volumes of poetry,\" referring to her first three books, \"Winter Sun\", \"The Dumbfounding\", and \"sunblue\".\nWith \"Winter Sun\", \"Avison established herself as a difficult and introspective poet given to private images and subtle shadings of emotion that challenge and frustrate the reader\" (says \"The Canadian Encyclopedia)\". \"These complexities in her writing conceal a deeply religious and vulnerable sensibility.\" \"In this volume the poet's subject matter varies from environmental destruction and the plight of the poor to metaphysical ponderings and playful explorations of language. Avison's emphasis is on looking at the familiar in new and thought-provoking ways.\" \"One of Avison's principal concerns in \"Winter Sun\" is perception, and she consistently emphasizes looking at the familiar in new and thought-provoking ways. Ernest H. Redekop has argued that 'there is a profound sense in Avison's poems that the world must not be forced into ordinary limits of sight and articulation.' In the poem \"Perspective,\" for instance, Avison attacks linear perspective.\"\n\"The Dumbfounding\" was \"a more accessible record of spiritual discovery, and a more revealing account of the unmasked, narrative 'I.'\" In this work, \"Avison expresses her wonder at her own rediscovered faith. It employs the same poetic techniques as \"Winter Sun\", but here the poet is no longer searching for meaning. \"Truth\" has been identified as the presence of a personal, loving, and forgiving God.\"\n\"This was further developed in \"sunblue\" (1978), a combination of social concern and moral values fused by religious conviction and a continuing restatement of personal faith.\" \"Both s\"unblue\" and \"No Time\" reconfirm Avison's commitment to her Christian faith... In conjunction with their Christian themes, Avison's poems often celebrate the creative power of the imagination as well as examining the concept of paradoxes and depicting people and landscapes from conflicting viewpoints.\"\n\"Avison has the reputation of being a cerebral poet. Her work has been characterized as 'intellectual'\" and 'deliberate'; her use of word-play, disconcerting shifts in viewpoint, complex metaphors, and literary allusions make her poetry a challenge to read.\" \"The thing with her poetry is that you must grapple with it, it just does not open up. Its rewards come only to those are willing to make the effort,\" said Zezulka. \"Her poems were not snacks, they were full meals.\"\n\"Reviewers have praised the poet for using complex language not as an end in itself, but to accurately convey her subject matter: the love and power of God.\" While \"some secularist critics find her post-conversion poetry too dogmatic,\" her defenders \"claim that the purpose of Avison's poetry goes beyond that of simple religious proselytizing.\"\nReviewing Avison's posthumous collection, \"Listening: Last Poems\" (2007), poet Judith Fitzgerald wrote of her: \"An original, an authentic visionary ... Avison praises Creation in all its transplendent awesome/awful mutations.\"\nThe University of Manitoba Archives &amp; Special Collections holds the https:// .

{"id": "74687", "revid": "50244296", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=74687", "title": "Zielona G\u00f3ra", "text": "City in Lubusz Voivodeship, Poland\nZielona G\u00f3ra (; lit.\u2009'Green Mountain'; ) is the largest city in Lubusz Voivodeship, located in western Poland, with 140,403 inhabitants (2021[ [update]]). The region is closely associated with vineyards and holds an annual Wine Fest. Zielona G\u00f3ra is one of the two capital cities of Lubusz Voivodeship, hosting the province's elected assembly, while the seat of the centrally appointed governor is in the city of Gorz\u00f3w Wielkopolski.\nIn 1222 Duke Henry the Bearded from the Piast dynasty brought the first settlers to the area. In 1323 Zielona G\u00f3ra was granted town privileges. The town was incorporated into the Kingdom of Bohemia in 1506 and became part of the Habsburg Empire in 1526. It experienced a wave of witch trials in the 17th century. As a result of the First Silesian War, the city became part of the Kingdom of Prussia in 1742. It then was part of the North German Confederation and the German Reich until the end of World War II in 1945, when it became again part of Poland.\nToponymy.\nIn the Silesian language, the city is called \"\u0179el\u016fno G\u016fra\" (in Steuer's Silesian alphabet) or \"Grinberg\"; using the Silesian primer alphabet: \"Ziel\u014dn\u014f G\u014dra\" or \"Grinberg\"; in Silesian German, the city was called \"Grienberg\".\nIn the 16th century, pseudo-historical Latin names appeared for the city, such as \"Prasia Elysiorum\" and \"Thalloris\".\nHistory.\nMiddle Ages.\nThe first settlement in the area of Zielona G\u00f3ra was built in the valley near the Z\u0142ota \u0141\u0105cza stream during the reign of the Polish ruler Mieszko I. The oldest settlement was agricultural. It later developed into a trading point along routes from Pozna\u0144 to \u017baga\u0144 and further to Lusatia. The written records of the Slavic settlement date to 1222 and an increase of its population by Henry the Bearded. Other documents date the settlement to 1302.\nThe region received an influx of German burghers in the second half of the 13th century during the medieval Ostsiedlung. In 1323, the settlement became a city with \"Crossener Recht\", a variation of Magdeburg rights. The earliest mention of the town's coat of arms is from 1421, although it is believed to have been arranged since the beginning of the 14th century. A document in the town archive of Thorn (Toru\u0144) dating from before 1400 used a sigil with the name \"GRVNINBERG\", an early form of the German name \"Gr\u00fcnberg\".\nIn 1294, Duke Henryk III of the Duchy of G\u0142og\u00f3w, founded a church in honour of Saint Hedwig, the High Duchess consort of Poland and patron saint of Silesia. Now designated a co-cathedral, it is the oldest building in the city. A wooden castle near the city, built ca. 1272, was the residence of Duke John of \u015acinawa from 1358 to 1365. Janusz had ceded his lands to Duke Henry V of Iron. In 1477 the town defeated a 5,000-strong army from neighbouring Brandenburg which attempted to seize it during the succession war to the Duchy of G\u0142og\u00f3w. In 1488, Duke John II of \u017baga\u0144, destroyed the castle to prevent his enemies from using it.\nThe deposition of Duke John II of \u017baga\u0144 in 1488 marked the end of the long rule of the Piast dynasty in the Duchy of G\u0142og\u00f3w and the city of Zielona G\u00f3ra. Later on, the duchy was ruled by the future Kings of Poland John I Albert and Sigismund I the Old. It was integrated with the Kingdom of Bohemia in 1506, although Polish king Sigismund I the Old still claimed his rights to the city in 1508.\nEarly modern period.\nThe city flourished during the reign of Sigismund I the Old. In 1505 Sigismund issued a privilege allowing the sale of cloth products from Zielona G\u00f3ra throughout Poland. In 1641, King W\u0142adys\u0142aw IV Vasa of Poland confirmed these rights. Another important branch of the city's economy at this time was winemaking.\nThe city converted to Lutheranism during the Protestant Reformation through the efforts of Paul Lemberg, Abbot of Sagan. The city declined during the 17th century, especially during the Thirty Years' War (1618\u20131648) and following decades. Gr\u00fcnberg endured plundering, debts, emigration of burghers, and fires. In 1651 during the Counter Reformation, the Habsburg monarchy of Austria reintroduced Roman Catholicism and suppressed Protestantism.\nThe city was subjected to heavy Germanisation and German craftsmen banned Poles from attending any practice allowing them to work as members of guilds. A rebellion caused by conscription ended with many Poles being imprisoned. From 1640, witch trials took place, the number of which increased significantly in 1663\u20131665. As a result, in 1669 the local court was deprived of the right to impose the death penalty on women accused of witchcraft.\nThe city was annexed by the Kingdom of Prussia by the 1742 Treaty of Breslau which ended the First Silesian War. The Prussians introduced religious toleration, leading to the construction of the Protestant parish church \"Zum Garten Christ\" from 1746 to 1747. Catholic Poles were later discriminated against, however. In 1758, during the Seven Years' War, POWs brought the plague to the city.\nLate modern period.\nThe city's textile industry was booming by the end of the 1700s. By 1800, large parts of the city walls had been dismantled to allow the city to expand. The textile industry suffered during the 1820s while adjusting to the Industrial Revolution and an import ban by the Russian Empire. The city's economy began to recover after many clothiers emigrated to Congress Poland. English industrialists were among the 19th-century economic reformers of Gr\u00fcnberg.\nDuring industrialisation, many Germans from the countryside moved to large industrial cities and a large number of Poles came to German cities to work as well. The Polish population was pushed by Germanisation to rural villages, although some remained in the town contributed to the economic revival of the city. A Polish church remained functional until 1809 and a Polish craftsmen association (\"Towarzystwo Polskich Rzemie\u015blnik\u00f3w\") was established by Kazimierz Lisowski in 1898; it existed till 1935 when Lisowski was murdered by the Gestapo. In 1923 a branch of the Union of Poles in Germany was established. In 1932 the German authorities did not allow the establishment of a Polish school.\nSince 1816 after the Napoleonic Wars, Gr\u00fcnberg was administered within the district \"Landkreis Gr\u00fcnberg\" in the Province of Silesia. In 1871 it became part of the German Empire during the unification of Germany. English industrialists purchased some of the city's textile factories during the 1870s and 1880s. By 1885, most of Gr\u00fcnberg's population of 14,396 were Protestants. The city was first connected to the Glogau (G\u0142og\u00f3w)-Gr\u00fcnberg-Guben railway line in 1871, followed by connections to Christianstadt (Nowogr\u00f3d Bobrza\u0144ski) in 1904, Wollstein (Wolsztyn) in 1905, and a local line to Sprottau (Szprotawa) in 1911.\nIn 1919, Gr\u00fcnberg became part of the Province of Lower Silesia within Weimar Germany. On 1 April 1922 it became a district-free city. This status was revoked on 1 October 1933 while part of Nazi Germany. During the \"Kristallnacht\" in 1938, the Germans destroyed the synagogue.\nWorld War II.\nDuring World War II the German Nazi government operated 42 forced labour camps in armaments production in the city, intended initially for Polish men and women, and later also Russians, Ukrainians, Britons, French and Italians. There were also three subcamps of the Gross-Rosen concentration camp within the modern city limits for Jewish men and women. In January 1945, a German-perpetrated death march of Jewish women from S\u0142awa reached the city, and the remaining prisoners were also sent on death marches westwards.\nOn 11 February 1945, the authorities of Zielona G\u00f3ra, then still Gr\u00fcnberg, received a report about Russians in the vicinity of Nowa S\u00f3l. Wehrmacht soldiers and civilians organizing defense in cities were threatened with being cut off from the south-west. In this situation, the preparations of Zielona G\u00f3ra for defense by regular troops were interrupted. On 11 February the Yalta Conference ended and it was not known exactly what would happen to Zielona G\u00f3ra. On 12 February the most important German offices and management boards of larger enterprises were evacuated beyond Nysa \u0141u\u017cycka.\nOn 13 February other residents were encouraged to leave the city through megaphones. The last train left in the evening. One of the previously sent transports was hit by an English air attack in Dresden and, according to some, about 900 inhabitants of Zielona G\u00f3ra died at the local railway station. On 14 February. Hitler's ardent supporters called on the Hitler Youth to defend themselves. Previously, the so-called Sonderkommando, which from the morning started blowing up strategic objects and immobilizing various technical devices, e.g. power plants, gas plants and waterworks.\nThe defenders set up two machine guns on the Branibor Hill. Having heard about the imminent threat from Nowa S\u00f3l, they withdrew to the city center. On the other hand, the supporters of a quick surrender, including the worker Alfred Kuntzel, the Nazi Friedrich Brucks and the communist Karl Laube formed a surrender committee. The Soviet Red Army occupied Gr\u00fcnberg with little fighting on 14 February 1945, during World War II.\nThe Red Army headed by the Third Army began artillery fire at 13:00 from cannons positioned on the hills south of Racula. After reaching the northern border of this village, the reconnaissance units moved towards the city. Some of them, following an arc, ended up in Racula, others in Stary Kisielin and even in Jany, and still others took over J\u0119drzych\u00f3w (Zielona G\u00f3ra). The main unit entered the city along Wroc\u0142awska Street. Soon, small groups of Red Army soldiers began to appear from the side of Ko\u017cuchowska Street. The 3rd Army established their headquarters in the Poviat Office building.\nIn that period, about 500 people committed suicide. The following month, according to the post-war Potsdam Agreement, the town was placed under Polish administration under territorial compensation for the territories of former Eastern Poland annexed by the Soviet Union. The remaining German inhabitants who had not fled their homes from the Eastern Front were expelled in accordance with the Potsdam Agreement.\nThe town was partly resettled with Poles transferred from Polish areas annexed by the Soviet Union. The city was briefly renamed \"Zielonog\u00f3ra\" in 1945, before the historic Polish name \"Zielona G\u00f3ra\" was restored. The 18th-century Protestant church was reconsecrated as a Catholic church (\"Ko\u015bci\u00f3\u0142 Matki Boskiej Cz\u0119stochowskiej\"). The city's first post-war mayor was Tomasz Sobkowiak, a former prisoner of the Auschwitz concentration camp during the German occupation of Poland. He is remembered as an efficient administrator, with a friendly attitude towards Germans.\nRecent history.\nFrom 1950 to 1998 Zielona G\u00f3ra was the capital of the Zielona G\u00f3ra Voivodeship. The city's population rebounded quickly after the war. By 1950 it had more inhabitants than at any point in its history.\nThe University of Zielona G\u00f3ra was opened in 2001. The city is also the seat of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Zielona G\u00f3ra-Gorz\u00f3w.\nGeography.\nZielona G\u00f3ra is surrounded by tree-covered hills. The adjacent woodland makes up approximately half of the city's total area. The name of the city translates to 'Green Mountain' in both Polish and German. Zielona G\u00f3ra features several tourist attractions and important historical sites including the preserved medieval Old Town, 13th-century Market Square, tenements, palaces, parks and the famous Palm House on Wine Hill. Its strong connection to vineyards and grape-picking earned Zielona G\u00f3ra the nickname \"The City of Wine\".\nWineries.\nThe city has been known for its wines for centuries. It is now one of two places in Poland with wine grape cultivation mainly for white wines, the other being the wine growing region near the town of Warka in Masovia. The first wineries around the city were built in 1314. At the Parady\u017c Abbey near Zielona G\u00f3ra, monks have been making wine since 1250. The number of vineyards at peak production is estimated at 4,000 in the region, with 2,500 in Zielona G\u00f3ra itself.\nDuring the communist era wine production was reduced, but since 1990 it has recovered. Since 1852, an annual wine festival has taken place in the town. Wine is no longer produced in Zielona G\u00f3ra itself, with the last factory closed in the early 1990s.\nVodka \"Luksusowa\" (namely: Luxury vodka), made from potatoes rather than grain, is produced in distillery in Zielona G\u00f3ra. \"Jarz\u0119biak\", a Polish fruit vodka made from rowan berries and other fruit ingredients, registered as a regional traditional beverage by the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development of Poland, is also produced in Zielona G\u00f3ra.\nAnother officially designated traditional beverage is the Zielona G\u00f3ra beer, with local brewing traditions dating back to the 18th century.\nClimate.\nThe climate is oceanic (K\u00f6ppen: \"Cfb\"). Despite being some distance from the sea, western standards as well as air masses are still predominant in the western than eastern, not very different from German cities near the border.\nDemographics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Module:Historical populations/styles.css\"/&gt;\nSights.\nAmong the landmarks of Zielona G\u00f3ra are:\nEducation.\nThe city has a university and a College of International Trade and Finance. Currently there are 18,000 students studying in the city.\nSecondary education.\nSecondary education is based on the high school type of educational facility.\nTransport.\nZielona G\u00f3ra Airport is located at Babimost, north-east of the city. It is currently the eleventh busiest airport in Poland, in terms of traffic size. Formerly a military base, it has become an important transport hub for western Poland. LOT Polish Airlines currently offers daily flights to Warsaw.\nThe city lies at the junction of National Road 3, National Road 27 and National Road 32 and is a major interchange on S3 Expressway along European route E65.\nZielona G\u00f3ra G\u0142\u00f3wna railway station is the most important railway station of Zielona G\u00f3ra. It has train connections to Gorz\u00f3w Wielkopolski, Zb\u0105szynek, Rzepin, Warsaw, Frankfurt (Oder) and Krak\u00f3w, main cities of the surrounding regions: Pozna\u0144, Szczecin and Wroc\u0142aw as well as direct international connections to Berlin, Vienna.\nSports.\nZielona G\u00f3ra is home to many sports teams, both professional and amateur. Motorcycle speedway is considered the most popular sport in the city, with the local club, Falubaz Zielona G\u00f3ra, being one of the most historic, successful, and well-supported teams in the country. The city is also represented by Zastal Zielona G\u00f3ra, a basketball club that has enjoyed a period of significant success in recent years. In football, Lechia Zielona G\u00f3ra competes in the lower tiers of the Polish league pyramid.\nTwin towns \u2013 sister cities.\nZielona G\u00f3ra is twinned with:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is a city in the Metropolis GZM, a metropolis with a population of two million. It is in the Silesian Highlands, on the K\u0142odnica River (tributary of the Oder).\nIt has been part of the Silesian Voivodeship since its formation in 1999. Previously, it was in Katowice Voivodeship, and before then, part of the Autonomous Silesian Voivodeship. Ruda \u015al\u0105ska is one of the cities in the Katowice urban area (population 2.7\u00a0million) and within the greater Katowice-Ostrava metropolitan area (population 5,294,000). The population of the city is 135,008 (December 2021).\nHistory.\nA large village is known to have existed at the location of the present day city center in 1243. The city name appears to indicate the awareness and perhaps exploitation of ores from early times.\nThe area underwent rapid industrialization (coal, steel, zinc) in the 19th and the beginning of 20th century. However, it remained a cluster of industrial settlements and villages until the 1950s, when it was administratively united. However, it never developed into a truly unified city.\nBefore the German invasion of Poland and the outbreak of World War II, in 1939, German saboteurs carried out an attack in Ruda. Following the invasion, the area was under German occupation from 1939 to 1945. Several Polish teachers from present-day Ruda \u015al\u0105ska were murdered by the Germans in concentration camps as part of the \"Intelligenzaktion\". The Germans also established and operated a \"Polenlager\" forced labour camp for Poles in the present-day district of Koch\u0142owice, and the E83 forced labour subcamp of the Stalag VIII-B/344 prisoner-of-war camp in the present-day district of Chebzie. The Polish resistance movement was active in the area. In 1945, the German occupation ended, and the area was restored to Poland, although with a Soviet-installed communist regime, which then stayed in power until the fall of communism in the 1980s.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Module:Historical populations/styles.css\"/&gt;\nAfter the fall of communism in 1989, the significant heavy industry was largely scaled down or restructured. The area has been transforming to a service-based economy. The well-known still operating coal mine is \"Halemba\".\nSince 2007, Ruda \u015al\u0105ska has been a member of the Upper Silesian Metropolitan Union (predecessor to the Metropolis GZM), the largest legally recognized urban area in Poland.\nTransport and infrastructure.\nSignificant roadways are Highway A4 and the Drogowa Trasa \u015arednicowa. There are several small railway stations, mainly on the line Katowice-Gliwice.\nSince 1950, Ruda \u015al\u0105ska is the site of a transmission facility, which was used from 1950 to 1988 for medium-wave radio broadcasting.\nHigher education.\nThe neighboring cities of Katowice and Gliwice are large academic centers. Ruda \u015al\u0105ska is a seat of the Higher Academy of Commerce (Wy\u017csza Szko\u0142a Handlowa).\nSubdivisions.\nThe city of Ruda \u015al\u0105ska is divided into following subdivisions:\nNotable people.\nRuda \u015al\u0105ska is the largest population center in Poland never to have been visited by Lech Wa\u0142\u0119sa.

Aside from his very successful reign, he was a highly respected scholar and author. His first wife and co-ruler was Cleopatra Selene II, daughter of Queen Cleopatra VII of Ptolemaic Egypt and Roman Triumvir Mark Antony.\nLife.\nEarly life and education.\nJuba II was a Berber prince from Numidia, Born in Hippone (Annaba). He was the only child and heir of King Juba I of Numidia; his mother's identity is unknown, though Juba II claimed to be a descendant of General Hannibal (Scol. Lucan, Pharsalia 8.287). In 46 BC, his father was defeated by Julius Caesar (in Thapsus, North Africa), and in 40 BC Numidia became a Roman province. His father had been an ally of the Roman General Pompey.\nSeveral modern scholars cite his age at Caesar's triumph in 46 BC as four or six giving rises to the typically cited birth year range of 52\u201350 BC, which his biographer, Duane Roller, believes is incorrect. Roller instead places his birth in early 48 BC because the Greek term \"brephos\" was used for him which means infant. The word for a child of age 4 to 6 is \"pais\" which was not used for him in the ancient sources. Therefore, Roller places his age in the triumph at anywhere from 2 months to 2 years, which actually indicates a birth year range between 48 and 46 BC.\nJuba II was brought to Rome by Julius Caesar and he took part in Caesar's triumphal procession. In Rome he learned the Latin and Greek, became romanized and was granted Roman citizenship. Through dedication to his studies, he is said to have become one of Rome's best educated citizens, and by age 20 he wrote one of his first works entitled \"Roman Archaeology\". \nHe was raised by Julius Caesar and later by his great-nephew Octavian (future Emperor Augustus). While growing up, Juba II accompanied Octavian on military campaigns, gaining valuable experience as a leader. He fought alongside Octavian in the Battle of Actium in 31 BC.\nRestoration to the Numidian throne.\nIn 30 BC, Octavian restored Juba II as king of Numidia. Juba II established Numidia as an ally of Rome. Probably as a result of his services to Augustus in a campaign in Hispania, between 27 BC and 25 BC, the Emperor made the final decision to give him his kingship of Mauretania. His kingdom replaced the province of Africa Nova which included territories of both Eastern Numidia and Western Numidia. This kingdom of Numidia (except the territory of Western Numidia) was in 25 BC directly annexed to the Roman Empire as the part of the Roman province of Africa Proconsularis and Juba II received Mauretania as his kingdom, enlarged by territory of Western Numidia. The marriage of Juba II and Cleopatra Selene II likely took place in 25 BC, when Cleopatra Selene was of proper age and Juba II was sent to rule Mauretania.\nReign in Mauretania.\nAccording to Strabo, upon the death of the Mauretanian king Bocchus II, who was an ally of the Romans, his kingdom was briefly governed directly by Rome (33 BC - 25 BC), then in 25 BC Juba II received it from Augustus. When Juba II and Cleopatra Selene moved to Mauretania, they named their new capital \"Caesaria\" (modern Cherchell, Algeria), in honour of Augustus. The construction and sculpture projects at Caesaria and another city, Volubilis, display a rich mixture of Egyptian, Greek and Roman architectural styles.\nCleopatra is said to have exerted considerable influence on Juba II's policies. Juba II encouraged and supported the performing arts, research of the sciences and research of natural history. Juba II also supported Mauretanian trade. The Kingdom of Mauretania was of great importance to the Roman Empire. Mauretania engaged in trade all across the Mediterranean, particularly with Spain and Italy. Mauretania exported fish, grapes, pearls, figs, grain, wooden furniture and purple dye harvested from certain shellfish, which was used in the manufacture of purple stripes for senatorial robes. Juba II sent a contingent to Iles Purpuraires to re-establish the ancient Phoenician dye manufacturing process. Tingis (modern Tangier), a town at the Pillars of Hercules (modern Strait of Gibraltar) became a major trade centre. In Gades, (modern C\u00e1diz) and Carthago Nova (modern Cartagena) in Spain, Juba II was appointed by Augustus as an honorary Duovir (a chief magistrate of a Roman colony or town).\nThe value and quality of the Mauretanian coinage became highly regarded. The Greek historian Plutarch describes him as 'one of the most gifted rulers of his time'. Between 2 BC and AD 2, he travelled with Gaius Caesar (a grandson of Augustus), as an advisor to the Eastern Mediterranean. In AD 21, Juba II made his son Ptolemy his co-ruler. \nJuba II died in AD 23. Juba II was buried alongside his first wife in the Royal Mausoleum of Mauretania. Ptolemy then became the sole ruler of Mauretania. \nWorks.\nWritings.\nJuba wrote a number of books in Greek on history, natural history, geography, grammar, painting and theatre. He compiled a comparison of Greek and Roman institutions known as \u038c\u03bc\u03bf\u03b9\u03cc\u03c4\u03b7\u03c4\u03b5\u03c2 (\"Resemblances\"). His guide to Arabia became a bestseller in Rome. Only fragments of his works survive. He collected a substantial library on a wide variety of topics, which no doubt complemented his own prolific output. Pliny the Elder refers to him as an authority 65\u00a0times in the \"Natural History\" and in Athens, a monument was built in the Gymnasium of Ptolemy in recognition of his writings.\nTen works by Juba II have provisionally been identified, but all are fragmentary:\nJuba's works survive only in quotations or citations by others, in both Greek and Latin. There are around 100 of these, about half in Pliny the Elder's \"Natural History\". Others can be found in Athenaeus, Plutarch, Claudius Aelianus Harpokration, Diosc\u00f3rides, Galen, Philostratus, Herodian, Tatian, Ammianus Marcellinus, Solinus, Hesychius of Miletus, Stephanos of Byzantium, Photios, the \"Etymologicum Magnum\", the \"Geoponica\" and various scholia on classical authors.\nJuba may have written plays, but these are not quoted, and no titles are known. The supposition relies on a reading of a passage in Athenaeus. There are two late citations to Juba that seem to be spurious. Photios cites the otherwise unknown \"On the Deterioration of Words\", while Fulgentius cites a certain \"Fisiologia\". Both may have been epitomes of Juba's authentic works.\nA treaty on metrics was formerly ascribed to him, but is now generally thought to have been written by an homonym.\nPatron of arts and sciences.\nJuba II was a noted patron of the arts and sciences and sponsored several expeditions and biological research. According to Pliny the Younger, Juba II sent an expedition to the Canary Islands and Madeira. He named them the Canary Islands for the particularly ferocious dogs (\"canarius\" \u2013 from \"canis\" \u2013 meaning \"of the dogs\" in Latin) the expedition found there.\nFlavius Philostratus recalled one of his anecdotes: \"And I have read in the discourse of Juba that elephants assist one another when they are being hunted, and that they will defend one that is exhausted, and if they can remove him out of danger, they anoint his wounds with the tears of the aloe tree, standing round him like physicians.\"\nJuba's Greek physician Euphorbus wrote that a succulent spurge found in the High Atlas was a powerful laxative. In 12 BC, Juba named this plant \"Euphorbia\" after Euphorbus, in response to Augustus dedicating a statue to Antonius Musa, Augustus's own personal physician and Euphorbus's brother. Botanist and taxonomist Carl Linnaeus assigned the name \"Euphorbia\" to the entire genus in the physician's honour. \"Euphorbia\" was later called \"Euphorbia regis-jubae\" (\"King Juba's euphorbia\") to honour the king's contributions to natural history and his role in bringing the genus to notice. The palm tree genus \"Jubaea\" is also named after Juba.\nThe following plant genera, species and varieties have been named after Juba:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "74700", "revid": "14650386", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=74700", "title": "Equestrianism", "text": "Equestrianism (from Latin , , , 'horseman', 'horse'), commonly known as horse riding (Commonwealth English) or horseback riding (American English), includes the disciplines of riding, driving, and vaulting. This broad description includes the use of horses for practical working purposes, transportation, recreational activities, artistic or cultural exercises, and competitive sport.\nHowever, recent studies have raised serious concerns about the impact of riding on horse welfare and pain (see: Impact of Riding on Horse Welfare).\nOverview of equestrian activities.\nHorses are trained and ridden for practical working purposes, such as in police work or for controlling herd animals on a ranch. They are also used in competitive sports including dressage, endurance riding, eventing, reining, show jumping, tent pegging, vaulting, polo, horse racing, driving, and rodeo (see additional equestrian sports listed later in this article for more examples). Some popular forms of competition are grouped together at horse shows where horses perform in a wide variety of disciplines. Horses (and other equids such as mules) are used for non-competitive recreational riding, such as fox hunting, trail riding, or hacking. There is public access to horse trails in almost every part of the world; many parks, ranches, and public stables offer both guided and independent riding. Horses are also used for therapeutic purposes both in specialized para-equestrian competition as well as non-competitive riding to improve human health and emotional development.\nHorses are also driven in harness racing, at horse shows, and in other types of exhibition such as historical reenactment or ceremony, often pulling carriages. In some parts of the world, they are still used for practical purposes such as farming.\nHorses continue to be used in public service, in traditional ceremonies (parades, funerals), police and volunteer mounted patrols and for mounted search and rescue.\nRiding halls, also known as indoor arenas or schools, enable training of horse and rider in all weathers as well as indoor competition riding.\nHistory of horse use.\nThough there is controversy over the exact date horses were domesticated and when they were first ridden, the best estimate is that horses first were ridden approximately 3500 BC. There is some evidence that about 3000 BC, near the Dnieper River and the Don River, people were using bits on horses, as a stallion that was buried there shows teeth wear consistent with using a bit. However, the most unequivocal early archaeological evidence of equines put to working use was of horses being driven. Chariot burials about 2500 BC present the most direct hard evidence of horses used as working animals. In ancient times chariot warfare was followed by the use of war horses as light and heavy cavalry. The horse played an important role throughout human history all over the world, both in warfare and in peaceful pursuits such as transportation, trade and agriculture. Horses lived in North America, but died out at the end of the Ice Age. Horses were brought back to North America by European explorers, beginning with the second voyage of Columbus in 1493. Equestrianism was introduced in the 1900 Summer Olympics as an Olympic sport with jumping events.\nHorse racing.\nHumans appear to have long expressed a desire to know which horse or horses were the fastest, and horse racing has ancient roots. Gambling on horse races appears to go hand-in hand with racing and has a long history as well. Thoroughbreds have the pre-eminent reputation as a racing breed, but other breeds also race.\nTypes of horse racing.\nUnder saddle:\nIn harness:\nDistance racing:\nInternational and Olympic disciplines.\nEquestrian events were first included in the modern Olympic Games in 1900. By 1912, all three Olympic disciplines were part of the games. Three forms of competition are recognized worldwide and are a part of the equestrian events at the Olympics. They are governed by the rules of the International Federation for Equestrian Sports (FEI):\nThe additional internationally sanctioned but non-Olympic disciplines governed by the FEI are: combined driving; endurance; reining; and vaulting. These disciplines are part of the FEI World Equestrian Games every four years and may hold their own individual World Championships in other years. The FEI also recognizes horseball and tent pegging as its two regional disciplines.\nPara-equestrian disciplines.\nPara-equestrian competition at the international level, including the Paralympics, are also governed by the FEI and offer the following competition events:\nImpact of Riding on Horse Welfare.\nSeveral studies have raised concerns about the effects of horseback riding on horses.\nA British study examined lameness and pain in both sport and school horses whose owners reported no such issues. Despite the owners\u2019 reports, the examination showed that about 73% of the horses exhibited some degree of lameness, and about half of them showed signs of pain during riding. Pain was measured using the Ridden Horse Pain Ethogram (RHpE). Similar results have been found in other studies and locations. Similar issues have also been found in leisure riding horses.\nAlthough rider skill positively affects horse welfare, it was found that all riders, regardless of skill or experience, fail to recognize behavioral signs that indicate pain. The researchers note that educating riders to recognize behaviors indicating pain may allow earlier detection of problems in the horse and provide appropriate treatment. Indeed, learning the RHpE improved veterinarians\u2019 ability to identify musculoskeletal pain in horses significantly.\nIn addition, it was found that riders struggle to recognize proper saddle fit or suitable saddle shape, regardless of their skill level. Various saddle and fitting issues can cause back pain. Harmful problems documented include asymmetrical saddle panels and a poorly fitted tree head (too narrow or too wide). The Society of Master Saddlers has published guidelines for optimal saddle fitting. Researchers have highlighted the importance of regular saddle fitting checks by a qualified fitter.\nHowever, even among qualified Society of Master Saddlers fitters, agreement on saddle assessments was not complete, so fitting a saddle according to the guidelines does not guarantee protection against errors.\nIt was found that the rider\u2019s weight affects the horse\u2019s pain. In addition, weight distribution on the horse\u2019s back also seems to be important. It is estimated that a skilled rider has better stability and weight distribution, which eases strain on the horse\u2019s back.\nHaute \u00c9cole.\nThe \"haute \u00e9cole\" (F. \"high school\"), an advanced component of Classical dressage, is a highly refined set of skills seldom used in competition but often seen in demonstration performances.\nThe world's leading Classical dressage programs include:\nOther major classical teams include the South African Lipizzaners and the Hollandsche Manege of the Netherlands.\nHorse shows.\nHorse shows are held throughout the world with a tremendous variety of possible events, equipment, attire, and judging standards used. However, most forms of horse show competition can be broken into the following broad categories:\nEnglish riding.\nIn addition to the classical Olympic events, the following forms of competition are seen. In North America they are referred to as \"English riding\" in contrast with western riding; elsewhere in the world, if a distinction is necessary, they are usually described as \"classic riding\": \nWestern riding.\nWestern riding evolved from the cattle-working and warfare traditions brought to the Americas by the Spanish, and both equipment and riding style evolved to meet the working needs of the cowboy on ranches in the American West.\nThe most noticeable feature of western style riding is the western saddle, which has a substantial saddle tree that provides support to horse and rider when working long hours in the saddle. The western saddle features a prominent pommel topped by a horn (a knob used for dallying a lariat after roping an animal), wide stirrups, and in some cases, both front and back cinches. The depth of the seat may depend on the activity, a deeper seat used for barrel racing or cutting cows or a more shallow seat for general ranch riding or Steer wrestling.\nFinished western horses are asked to perform with a loose rein controlled by one hand. The headstall of a western bridle may utilize either a Snaffle bit or curb bit. Bitless headstalls are also seen, such as a bosal-style hackamore on younger horses, or various styles of mechanical hackamore. In Vaquero style training, a combination of a bosal and bit, called a \"two-rein\", is used at some stages of training. The standard western bridle lacks a noseband and usually consists of a single set of reins attached to a curb bit that has somewhat longer shanks than the curb of an English Weymouth bridle or a pelham bit. Western bridles have either a browband or else a \"one ear\" loop (sometimes two) that crosses in front of the horse's ear. Two styles of Western reins developed: The long split reins of the Texas tradition, which are completely separated, or the \"Romal\" reins of the California tradition, which are closed reins with a long single attachment (the romal) that can be used as a quirt. Modern rodeo competitors in timed events sometimes use a closed rein without a \"romal\".\nWestern riders wear a long-sleeved shirt, long pants or jeans, cowboy boots, and a wide-brimmed cowboy hat. A rider may wear protective leather leggings called chaps. Riders may wear brighter colors or finer fabrics in competition than for work. In particular, horse show events such as Western pleasure may much flashier equipment. Saddles, bits and bridles are ornamented with substantial amounts of silver, rider clothing may have vivid colors and even rhinestones or sequins.\nHarness.\nHorses, ponies, mules and donkeys are driven in harness in many different ways. For working purposes, they can pull a plow or other farm equipment designed to be pulled by animals. In many parts of the world they still pull wagons for basic hauling and transportation. They may draw carriages at ceremonies, in parades or for tourist rides.\nAs noted in \"horse racing\" \"above\", horses can race in harness, pulling a very lightweight cart known as a sulky. At the other end of the spectrum, some draft horses compete in horse pulling competitions, where single or teams of horses and their drivers vie to determine who can pull the most weight for a short distance.\nIn horse show competition, the following general categories of competition are seen:\nRodeo.\nRodeo events include the following forms of competition:\nRoping.\nRoping includes a number of timed events that are based on the real-life tasks of a working cowboy, who often had to capture calves and adult cattle for branding, medical treatment and other purposes. A lasso or lariat is thrown over the head of a calf or the horns of adult cattle, and the animal is secured in a fashion dictated by its size and age.\n\"Rough Stock\" competition.\nIn spite of popular myth, most modern \"broncs\" are not in fact wild horses, but horses bred specifically as bucking stock.\nOther equestrian activities.\nThere are many other forms of equestrian activity and sports seen worldwide. There are both competitive events and pleasure riding disciplines available.\nHealth issues.\nHorseback riding is a leading cause of sports-related traumatic brain injury in the United States. A 2023 study of 210 equestrians found a higher incidence of concussion in equestrian sports than football or rugby.\nHandling, riding and driving horses have inherent risks. Horses are large prey animals with a well-developed flight or fight instinct able to move quickly and unexpectedly. When mounted, the rider's head may be up to from the ground, and the horse may travel at a speed of up to . The injuries observed range from very minor injuries to fatalities.\nA study in Germany reported that the relative risk of injury from riding a horse, compared to riding a bicycle, was 9 times higher for adolescents and 5.6 times higher for younger children, but that riding a horse was less risky than riding a moped. In Victoria, Australia, a search of state records found that equestrian sports had the third highest incidence of serious injury, after motor sports and power boating. In Greece, an analysis of a national registry estimated the incidence of equestrian injury to be 21 per 100,000 person-years for farming and equestrian sports combined, and 160 times higher for horse racing personnel. Other findings noted that helmets likely prevent traumatic brain injuries.\nIn the United States each year an estimated 30 million people ride horses, resulting in 50,000 emergency department visits (1 visit per 600 riders per year). A survey of 679 equestrians in Oregon, Washington and Idaho estimated that at some time in their equestrian career one in five will be seriously injured, resulting in hospitalization, surgery or long-term disability. Among survey respondents, novice equestrians had an incidence of any injury that was threefold over intermediates, fivefold over advanced equestrians, and nearly eightfold over professionals. Approximately 100 hours of experience are required to achieve a substantial decline in the risk of injury. The survey authors conclude that efforts to prevent equestrian injury should focus on novice equestrians.\nMechanisms of injury.\nThe most common injury is falling from the horse, followed by being kicked, trampled and bitten. About 3 out of 4 injuries are due to falling, broadly defined. A broad definition of falling often includes being crushed and being thrown from the horse, but when reported separately each of these mechanisms may be more common than being kicked.\nTypes and severity of injury.\nIn Canada, a 10-year study of trauma center patients injured while riding reported that although 48% had suffered head injuries, only 9% of these riders had been wearing helmets at the time of their accident. Other injuries involved the chest (54%), abdomen (22%) and extremities (17%). A German study reported that injuries in horse riding are rare compared to other sports, but when they occur they are severe. Specifically, they found that 40% of horse riding injuries were fractures, and only 15% were sprains. Furthermore, the study noted that in Germany, one quarter of all sport related fatalities are caused by horse riding.\nMost horse related injuries are a result of falling from a horse, which is the cause of 60\u201380% of all such reported injuries. Another common cause of injury is being kicked by a horse, which may cause skull fractures or severe trauma to the internal organs. Some possible injuries resulting from horse riding, with the percent indicating the amounts in relation to all injuries as reported by a New Zealand study, include:\nAmong 36 members and employees of the Hong Kong Jockey Club who were seen in a trauma center during a period of 5 years, 24 fell from horses and 11 were kicked by the horse. Injuries comprised: 18 torso; 11 head, face or neck; and 11 limb. The authors of this study recommend that helmets, face shields and body protectors be worn when riding or handling horses.\nIn New South Wales, Australia, a study of equestrians seen at one hospital over a 6-year period found that helmet use both increased over time and was correlated with a lower rate of admission. However, 81% of admissions were wearing a helmet at the time of injury, In the second half of the study period, of the equestrians seen at a hospital, only 14% were admitted. In contrast, a study of child equestrians seen at a hospital emergency department in Adelaide reported that 60% were admitted.\nIn the United States, an analysis of National Electronic Injury Surveillance System (NEISS) data performed by the Equestrian Medical Safety Association studied 78,279 horse-related injuries in 2007: \"The most common injuries included fractures (28.5%); contusions/abrasions (28.3%); strain/sprain (14.5%); internal injury (8.1%); lacerations (5.7%); concussions (4.6%); dislocations (1.9%); and hematomas (1.2%). Most frequent injury sites are the lower trunk (19.6%); head (15.0%); upper trunk (13.4%); shoulder (8.2%); and wrist (6.8%). Within this study patients were treated and released (86.2%), were hospitalized (8.7%), were transferred (3.6%), left without being treated (0.8%), remained for observation (0.6%) and arrived at the hospital deceased (0.1%).\"\nHead injuries.\nHorseback riding is one of the most dangerous sports, especially in relation to head injury. Statistics from the United States, for example, indicate that about 30 million people ride horses annually. On average, about 67,000 people are admitted to the hospital each year from injuries sustained while working with horses. 15,000 of those admittances are from traumatic brain injuries. Of those, about 60 die each year from their brain injuries. Studies have found horseback riding to be more dangerous than several sports, including skiing, auto racing and football. Horseback riding has a higher hospital admittance rate per hours of riding than motorcycle racing, at 0.49 per thousand hours of riding and 0.14 accidents per thousand hours, respectively.\nHead injuries are especially traumatic in horseback riding. About two-thirds of all riders requiring hospitalization after a fall have sustained a traumatic brain injury. Falling from a horse without wearing a helmet is comparable to being struck by a car. Most falling deaths are caused by head injury.\nThe use of riding helmets substantially decreases the likelihood and severity of head injuries. Riders falling with a helmet are five times less likely to experience a traumatic brain injury than a rider who falls without a helmet. Helmets work by crushing on impact and extending the length of time it takes the head to stop moving. Despite this, helmet usage rates in North America are estimated to be between eight and twenty percent.\nOnce a helmet has sustained an impact from falling, that part of the helmet is structurally weakened, even if no visible damage is present. Helmet manufacturers recommend that a helmet that has undergone impact from a fall be replaced immediately. In addition, helmets should be replaced every three to five years; specific recommendations vary by manufacturer.\nRules on helmet use in competition.\nMany organizations mandate helmet use in competition or on show grounds, and rules have continually moved in the direction of requiring helmet use. In 2011, the United States Equestrian Federation passed a rule making helmet use mandatory while mounted on competition grounds at U.S. nationally rated eventing competitions. Also in 2011, the United States Dressage Federation made helmet use in competition mandatory for all riders under 18 and all riders who are riding any test at Fourth Level and below. Riders competing at Prix St. Georges and above and also riding a test at Fourth Level or below, must also wear a helmet at all times while mounted.\nRiding astride.\nThe idea that riding a horse astride could injure a woman's sex organs is a historic, but sometimes popular even today, misunderstanding or misconception, particularly that riding astride can damage the hymen. Evidence of injury to any female sex organs is scant. In female high-level athletes, trauma to the perineum is rare and is associated with certain sports (see Pelvic floor#Clinical significance). The type of trauma associated with equestrian sports has been termed \"horse riders' perineum\". A case series of 4 female mountain bike riders and 2 female horse riders found both patient-reported perineal pain and evidence of sub-clinical changes in the clitoris; the relevance of these findings to horse riding is unknown.\nIn men, sports-related injuries are among the major causes of testicular trauma. In a small controlled but unblinded study of 52 men, varicocele was significantly more common in equestrians than in non-equestrians. The difference between these two groups was small, however, compared to differences reported between extreme mountain bike riders and non-riders, and also between mountain bike riders and on-road bicycle riders. Horse-riding injuries to the scrotum (contusions) and testes (blunt trauma) were well known to surgeons in the 19th century and early 20th century. Injuries from collision with the pommel of a saddle are mentioned specifically.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\nUse of horses for sport or work"}

{"id": "74702", "revid": "1317575126", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=74702", "title": "Ptolemy of Mauretania", "text": "Roman Client King of Mauretania (AD 20-40)\nPtolemy of Mauretania (, \"Ptolema\u00eeos\"; ; 13~9 BC \u2013 AD40) was the last Roman client king and ruler of Mauretania for Rome. He was the son of Juba II, the king of Numidia and a member of the Berber Massyles tribe, as well as a descendant of the Ptolemaic dynasty via his mother Cleopatra Selene II.\nLife.\nPtolemy was the son of King Juba II and Queen Cleopatra Selene II of Mauretania. His birth date is not certainly known but must have occurred before his mother's death, which has been estimated to have taken place in 5BC. He had a sister (possibly younger) who is evidenced by an Athenian inscription, but her name has not been preserved. She may have been called Drusilla. \nHis father Juba II was the son of King Juba I of Numidia, who was descended from the Berbers of North Africa and was an ally to the Roman Triumvir Pompey. His mother Cleopatra Selene II was the daughter of the Ptolemaic Greek Queen Cleopatra VII of Egypt and the Roman Triumvir Mark Antony. Ptolemy was of Berber, Greek and Roman ancestry. Ptolemy and his sister were the only known children of Juba II and Cleopatra Selene II to reach maturity, and were among the younger grandchildren to Mark Antony. Through his maternal grandfather, Ptolemy was distantly related to Julius Caesar and the Julio-Claudian dynasty. Ptolemy was a first cousin to Germanicus and the Roman Emperor Claudius and a second cousin to the Emperor Caligula, the Empress Agrippina the Younger, the Empress Valeria Messalina and the Emperor Nero. \nPtolemy was most probably born in Caesaria, the capital of the Kingdom of Mauretania (modern Cherchell, Algeria) in the Roman Empire. He was named in honor of his mother's ancestors, in particular the Ptolemaic dynasty. In choosing her son's name, Cleopatra Selene II created a distinct Greek-Egyptian tone and emphasized her role as the monarch who would continue the Ptolemaic dynasty. She by-passed the ancestral names of her husband. By naming her son Ptolemy instead of a Berber ancestral name, she offers an example rare in ancient history, especially in the case of a son who is the primary male heir, of reaching into the mother's family instead of the father's for a name. This emphasized the idea that his mother was the heiress of the Ptolemies and the leader of a Ptolemaic government in exile.\nThrough his parents, Ptolemy had Roman citizenship, and they sent him to Rome to be educated. His mother likely died in 5BC and was placed in the Royal Mausoleum of Mauretania, built by his parents. In Rome, Ptolemy received a good Roman education. He was part of the remarkable court of his maternal aunt Antonia Minor, an influential aristocrat who presided over a circle of various princes and princesses which assisted in the political preservation of the Roman Empire's borders and affairs of the client states. Antonia Minor, the youngest daughter of Mark Antony and the youngest niece of Emperor Augustus, was a half-sister of Ptolemy's late mother, also a daughter of Mark Antony. Antonia Minor's mother was Octavia Minor, Mark Antony's fourth wife and the second sister of Octavian (later Augustus). \nPtolemy lived in Rome until the age of 21, when he returned to the court of his aging father in Mauretania.\nReign.\nWhen Ptolemy returned to Mauretania, JubaII made Ptolemy his co-ruler and successor. Coinage has survived from JubaII's co-rule with his son. On coinage, on one side is a central bust of JubaII with his title in Latin\" \u2018King Juba\u2019\". On the other side is a central bust of Ptolemy and the inscription stating in Latin\" \u2018King Ptolemy son of Juba\u2019\". JubaII died in 23 and was placed alongside Cleopatra SeleneII in the Royal Mausoleum of Mauretania. Ptolemy then became the sole ruler of Mauretania.\nDuring his co-rule with JubaII, and into his sole rule, Ptolemy, like his father, appeared to be a patron of art, learning, literature and sports. In Athens, Greece, statues were erected to JubaII and Ptolemy in a gymnasium, and a statue was erected in Ptolemy's honor in reference to his taste in literature. Ptolemy dedicated statues of himself on the Acropolis. The Athenians honored Ptolemy and his family with inscriptions dedicated to them, and this reveals that the Athenians had respect towards the Roman Client Monarchs and their families, which was common in the 1st century.\nIn the year 17, the local Berber tribes, the Numidian Tacfarinas and Garamantes, started to revolt against the Kingdom of Mauretania and Rome. The war had ravaged Africa, and Berber forces included former slaves from Ptolemy's household who had joined in the revolt. Ptolemy through his military campaigns was unsuccessful in ending the Berber revolt. The war reached the point where Ptolemy summoned the Roman governor of Africa, Publius Cornelius Dolabella, and his army to assist him in ending the revolt. The war ended in the year 24. Although Ptolemy's army and the Romans won, both parties suffered considerable losses of infantry and cavalry.\nThe Roman Senate, impressed by Ptolemy's loyal conduct, had sent a Roman senator to visit him. The Roman senator recognized Ptolemy's loyal conduct and awarded him an ivory scepter, an embroidered triumphal robe, and the senator greeted Ptolemy as \"king, ally, and friend\". This recognition was a tradition which recognized and rewarded the allies of Rome.\nPtolemy, through his military campaigns, had proven his capability and loyalty as an ally and Client King to Rome. He was a popular monarch with the Berbers and had travelled extensively throughout the Roman Empire, including Alexandria, Egypt and Ostia, Italy.\nIn Caesaria, prayers were offered for the health of Ptolemy at the Temple of Saturn \"frugifer dues\". Mauretania was a region that was abundant in agriculture, and a god considered equivalent to Saturn was the god of agriculture. This cult was an important one in the kingdom. A temple and a sanctuary were dedicated to Saturn in Caesaria by 30 and, throughout Mauretania, various temples were dedicated to Saturn.\nHis mother originated from Egypt, where there were various imperial cults dedicated to the Pharaohs and their relatives, and there is a possibility that his father's Royal Numidian ancestors may have had imperial cults dedicated to them.\nA surviving inscription in Mauretania hints that either JubaII or Ptolemy established an imperial cult honoring Hiempsal II, a previous Numidian King and paternal grandfather of JubaII. According to inscription evidence, Ptolemy may have established a Royal Mauretanian cult honoring himself and his late parents (see Berber mythology). One inscription is dedicated to his genius, and another inscription expressed wishes for his good health.\nEvidence suggesting that Ptolemy could have deified JubaII after his death is from the writings of the Christian author of the 3rd century, Marcus Minucius Felix. In Felix's \"Octavius\", the writer records a dialogue between a Christian and a pagan from Cirta. This dialogue was part of a Christian argument that divinity is impossible for mortals. Felix lists humans who were said to have become divine: \"Saturn, Jupiter, Romulus and Juba\". Further literary evidence, suggesting the deification of JubaII by Ptolemy, is from the brief euhemerist exercise entitled \"On the Vanity of Idols\" by the 3rd-century Christian saint Cyprian. In his exercise in deflating the gods, Cyprian observed and stated that the Mauretanians were manifestly worshiping their kings and did not conceal their name by any disguise. According to the surviving evidence, there is a strong probability that JubaII and Ptolemy were deified by the Berbers after their deaths.\nCoinage from Ptolemy's sole reign is different from those during the time Ptolemy co-ruled with JubaII. His royal title on coinage is in Latin\" \u2018King Ptolemy\u2019\" and there is no surviving coinage that shows his royal title in Greek. On his coinage there is no Ancient Egyptian imagery. The coinage from his sole reign displays a variety of themes. Ptolemy personified himself as an elephant on coins. Elephant personification is an ancient coinage tradition in which his late parents partook when they ruled Mauretania. The elephant has symbolic functions: an icon representing Africa and an iconic monetary characteristic from the Hellenistic period which displays influence and power. Another animal Ptolemy uses on coins is a lion leaping, which is a symbol of animal kingship and is a symbol representing Africa.\nOther coins display Roman themes. A rare revealing gold coin, dated from the year 39, celebrates Ptolemy's ascent, his rule, and his loyalty to Rome. On one side of the coin is a central bust of JubaII inscribed in Latin \"\u2018King Juba son of Juba\u2019\". JubaII is personified like a Greek Egyptian pharaoh from the Ptolemaic dynasty. The other side of the coin is an eagle with its wings displayed on a thunderbolt, and Ptolemy's initials are inscribed in Latin. Through his father's central bust and inscription, Ptolemy is celebrating and showing the continuation of his family and rule, while honoring his paternal ancestry. Ptolemy through the eagle is celebrating the Roman Peace, honoring the rule of the Roman Empire, while he is showing his allegiance and loyalty to Ancient Rome. Another coin, dating from the year 40, celebrates his senatorial decree. The coin shows, on one side, a curule chair upon which is a wreath and has a sceptre leaning against it. On the other side of the coin, Ptolemy is wearing a fillet on his head.\nPtolemy seemed to have had expensive tastes and enjoyed luxury items. He owned a custom-made citrus wood wine table. Mauretania had many citrus trees and produced many citrus wood tables, which were frequently sought out by aristocrats and monarchs.\nPtolemy married a woman named Julia Urania, who came from obscure origins. She is only known through a funeral inscription found at Caesaria through her freedwoman Julia Bodina. Bodina ascribed Julia Urania as \"Queen Julia Urania\". There is a possibility that Julia Urania was a member of the royal family of Emesa (modern Homs, Syria). Drusilla, who is recorded as descendant of Cleopatra VII and Mark Antony, was most likely the daughter of the royal couple, born around 38. \nDeath.\nThe Kingdom of Mauretania was one of the wealthiest Roman client kingdoms, and after 24, Ptolemy continued to reign without interruption. In late 40, Caligula invited Ptolemy to Rome and welcomed him with appropriate honors. Ptolemy was confirmed as king and an ally and friend of the empire, but he was assassinated by the order of Caligula. Caligula's motivation is unclear. Ancient historians claim envy of Ptolemy's wealth or a theatrical crowd's admiration of Ptolemy's purple cloak. Later historians have suggested other motivations. Some of these are inspired by Suetonius's claim about the purple cloak, while others are independent of the claims of the ancient historians, for example, the idea that Ptolemy may have been implicated in a plot by Gaetulicus or Caligula wanted to exert greater control over Mauretania.\nAfter Ptolemy's murder in Rome, his former household slave Aedemon, from outrage and out of loyalty to his former master, took revenge against Caligula by starting the revolt of Mauretania with the Berbers against Rome. The Berber revolt was a violent one, and the rebels were skilled fighters against the Roman Army. The Roman generals Gnaeus Hosidius Geta and Gaius Suetonius Paulinus were needed to end the revolt. Mauretania was divided into two provinces, which were Mauretania Tingitana and Mauretania Caesariensis.\nIn popular culture.\nPtolemy is a minor character in the novels by Robert Graves, \"I Claudius \" and \"Claudius the God\".\nHe appears in Stephanie Dray's novel \"Daughters of the Nile\", which marked the end of the trilogy focusing on Ptolemy's mother.\nThroughout Algeria and Morocco, statues have survived that belonged to Ptolemy. There is a nude statue of him, dated from the 1st century, which is on display at the Museum of History and Civilizations in Rabat, Morocco. His sculpted images are of a youthful appearance, and particularly those first portraits created during the reign of JubaII virtually show his relations to the Julio-Claudian dynasty. This is evident by the arrangement of the comma shaped locks over the forehead. There is a seven-inch fine bronze Roman imperial bust of Ptolemy about age 15 which Sotheby's auctioned in New York for $960,000 in 2004.\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The work is based on a collection of testimonials from German civilians and \"Wehrmacht\" military personnel; and devoted to the expulsion of Germans after World War II from states previously occupied by Nazi Germany. It includes as well selected interviews with British and American politicians who participated at the Potsdam Conference, including Robert Murphy, Geoffrey Harrison (drafter of article XIII of the Potsdam Protocol), and Denis Allen (drafter of article IX on the provisional post-war borders). The book attempts to describe the crimes committed against the German nation by the Soviet Union, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Yugoslavia at the end of World War II\u00a0\u2013 as perceived by the expellees themselves and settlers brought in \"Heim ins Reich\" (Home into the Empire) from the east.\nThe author begins with the history of German settlement in Central and Eastern Europe since the 12th century, the impact of the Treaty of Versailles on German minorities in Poland and Czechoslovakia, the failure of the League of Nations system of minority protection, the outbreak of World War\u00a0II and selected crimes committed by the Nazis, followed by the story of refugees from the former Eastern parts of Germany (Silesia, East Prussia, Pomerania, East Brandenburg), as well as the fate of German minorities in Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Poland, Romania, Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union.\nIn the book, de Zayas claims that approximately two million Germans died during the post period of 1944\u20131949, although his claim does not withstand scrutiny. Most recent research on the subject has put the number at around half a million.\nPrinting history.\nThe book originated as a script for a television documentary by the Bavarian Broadcasting. It was a popular rendition of the author's monography on the expulsions called the \"Nemesis at Potsdam\" (). This shorter introduction to the subject was published in German as \"Anmerkungen zur Vertreibung der Deutschen aus dem Osten\" (4 editions during 1986\u20131996, Kohlhammer Verlag, Stuttgart, ), first printed in English under the title of \"The German Expellees: Victims in War and Peace\" (St. Martin's Press, New York, 1993, Macmillan, London). The new, 1994 English title, included the then neologism \"ethnic cleansing\", used at that time in relation to the crimes committed by Serbs in Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina of the 1990s. The 5th expanded German 2006 edition was titled \"Die deutschen Vertriebenen\" (Leopold Stocker Verlag, ). The book ends with 12 historical theses, 14 legal theses and 10 conclusions. It was positively reviewed in Germany by Andreas Hillgruber in the Historische Zeitschrift and Gotthold Rhode in the \"Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung\".\nThe 2006 English edition was expanded by about 20%. It contains additional information from interviews with the children of the displaced, German expellees who migrated to the United States and Canada, new photos and new statistical tables.\nReviews.\n\"This popularly written but still scholarly study follows the author's other successful books in the fields of history and international law [which] were hailed by historians as well as lawyers as masterpieces of academic craftsmanship. His book presents in a nutshell the history of the ethnic German population which had settled in the early 13th century in large parts of what is nowadays Eastern Europe.\" \"Netherlands International Law Review\" 1986, pp.\u00a0430\u2013431. \n\"This is the story of the ethnic Germans who found themselves in the wrong place at the wrong time. Some two million died and fifteen million were displaced \u2013 driven from their lands by those opposed to anyone and everything German... De Zayas's moving plea is that one's home should be a human right. As frontiers once more shift in Eastern Europe and families flee in Bosnia, he could hardly have chosen a better moment to deliver it.\" \"The Times\", (London) 18 November 1993. \nCriticism.\nOne reviewer, Rainer Ohliger of Humboldt University, argues that de Zayas over-emphasizes the role of the Bund der Vertriebenen (non-governmental association representing the expellees) and its property and territorial claims. It has been noted that no West\u2013East migration occurred when this possibility arose after the unification of the German states, and that practically no Germans have returned to the East after the Baltic States, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Romania entered the European Union.\nThe book has also been criticized for its victim perspective, normally unsuitable for scholarly works, unfavourably comparing it with a more recent book of Detlef Brandes. The 2006 revised and enlarged edition of \"Terrible Revenge\" with Palgrave/Macmillan takes some of these considerations into account. In the introduction the author notes that a \"Terrible Revenge\" is a popularized version of his longer monograph \"Nemesis at Potsdam\" (1\u20133 editions Routledge, 6th edition Picton Press, Rockland, Maine 2003). See also review of the Future of Freedom Foundation.\nOther reviews have criticized both de Zayas and Brandes reversely. According to Eagle Glassheim on the H-Net website, Brandes does not provide any moral conclusion deriving from violence against civilians due to their ethnic heritage.\nGenocide historians Donald Bloxham and Tony Kushner describe the book as \"tendentious\".\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is one of the most ancient of all sports, as its basic premise \u2013 to identify which of two or more horses is the fastest over a set course or distance \u2013 has been mostly unchanged since at least classical antiquity.\nHorse races vary widely in format, and many countries have developed their own particular traditions around the sport. Variations include restricting races to particular breeds, running over obstacles, running over different distances, running on different track surfaces, and running in different gaits. In some races, horses are assigned different weights to carry to reflect differences in ability, a process known as handicapping.\nWhile horses are sometimes raced purely for sport, a major part of horse racing's interest and economic importance is in the gambling associated with it, an activity that in 2019 generated a worldwide market worth around US$115\u00a0billion.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nWorld Championship.\nThe International Federation of Horseracing Authorities was founded in 1961 with the task of standardizing international Thoroughbred horseracing practices, but no official world championship exists.\nHistory.\nHorse racing has a long and distinguished history and has been practiced in civilizations across the world since ancient times. Archaeological records indicate that horse racing occurred in Ancient Greece, Ancient Rome, Babylon, Syria, Arabia, and Egypt. It also plays an important part of myth and legend, such as in the contest between the steeds of the god Odin and the giant Hrungnir in Norse mythology.\nChariot racing was one of the most popular sports of ancient Greece, Rome and the Byzantine Empire. By 648 BCE, both chariot and mounted horse racing events were part of the ancient Greek Olympics, and were important in the other Panhellenic Games. Chariot racing was dangerous to both driver and horse, often leading to serious injury and even death. In the Roman Empire, chariot and mounted horse racing were major industries. The chariot teams were organized into four different principal factions, each distinguished by a color: red, white, blue, and green. From the mid-fifth century BCE, spring carnival in Rome closed with a horse race. Fifteen to twenty riderless horses, originally imported from the Barbary Coast of North Africa, were set loose to run the length of the Via del Corso, a long, straight city street. The race lasted about two-and-a-half minutes.\nIn later times, Thoroughbred racing became popular with British royalty and aristocrats, earning it the title of \"Sport of Kings\".\nHistorically, equestrians honed their skills through games and races. Equestrian sports provided entertainment for crowds and displayed the horsemanship required for battle. Horse racing evolved from impromptu competitions among riders and drivers. The various forms of competition, which required demanding and specialized skills from both horse and rider, resulted in the systematic development of specialized breeds and equipment. The popularity of equestrian sports throughout the centuries has resulted in the preservation of skills that would otherwise have vanished once horses were no longer used in combat.\nIn Britain, horse racing became well-established in the 18th century, and continued to grow in popularity. King Charles II (reigned 1649 to 1685) was an avid sportsman who gave Newmarket its prominence. By 1750, the Jockey Club was formed as a way to control the Newmarket races, set the rules of the game, prevent dishonesty, and create a level field. The Epsom Derby began in 1780. The first of the five classic races began with the St Leger Stakes in 1776. In 1814, the system was complete with five annual races. While Newmarket and the Jockey Club set the standards, most of the racing took place in landowners' fields and in rising towns for small cash prizes and enormous local prestige. The system of wagering was essential to funding and growing of the industry, and all classes, from paupers to royalty participated. Members of high society were in control, and they made a special effort to keep out the riff-raff and to keep the criminal element away from the wagering. With real money at stake, the system needed skilled jockeys, trainers, grooms, and experts at breeding, which opened up new careers for working-class rural men. Every young ambitious stable boy could dream of making it big.\nIn addition to its rich history, horse racing is marked by noteworthy statistics. The Thoroughbred Secretariat still holds the fastest times in all three Triple Crown races from his 1973 wins. North American Jockey Russell Baze has an unmatched 12,842 victories. Economic significance is reflected in the career earnings of Romantic Warrior, totaling over $27 million.\nHorse racing has also seen technological advancements, with innovations like photo finishes, electronic timing, and advanced breeding selection techniques enhancing the sport's precision and competitiveness.\nHorse racing was one of the few sports that continued during the 2020 COVID-19 crisis, with the Australian and Hong Kong racing jurisdictions carrying on, albeit with no crowds. The United States, the United Kingdom, and France were some of the more prominent racing bodies to either postpone or cancel all events.\nTypes of horse racing.\nThere are many types of horse racing, including:\nDifferent breeds of horses have been bred to excel in each of these disciplines. Breeds that are used for flat racing include the Thoroughbred, Quarter Horse, Arabian, Paint, and Appaloosa. Jump racing breeds include the Thoroughbred and AQPS. In harness racing, Standardbreds are used in Australia, New Zealand and North America. In Europe, Russian and French Trotters are used with Standardbreds. Light cold blood horses, such as Finnhorses and Scandinavian Coldblood Trotters are also used in harness racing within their respective geographical areas.\nThere are also races for ponies: both flat and jump and harness racing.\nFlat racing.\nFlat racing is the most common form of horse racing seen worldwide. Flat racing tracks are typically oval in shape and are generally level, although in Great Britain and Ireland there is much greater variation, including figure-of-eight tracks like Windsor and tracks with often severe gradients and changes of camber, such as Epsom Racecourse. Track surfaces vary, with turf most common in Europe and dirt more common in North America and Asia. Newly designed synthetic surfaces, such as Polytrack or Tapeta, are seen at some tracks.\nIndividual flat races are run over distances ranging from to more than , although races longer than are quite rare, and distances between are the most common. Short races are generally referred to as \"sprints\", while longer races are known as \"routes\" in the United States or \"staying races\" in Europe. Although fast acceleration (\"a turn of foot\") is usually required to win either type of race, sprints are generally seen as a test of speed, while long-distance races are seen as a test of stamina. The most prestigious flat races in the world, such as the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe, Melbourne Cup, Japan Cup, Epsom Derby, Kentucky Derby and Dubai World Cup, are run over distances in the middle of this range and are seen as tests of both speed and stamina to some extent.\nIn the most prestigious races, horses are generally allocated the same weight to carry for fairness, with allowances given to younger horses and female horses running against males. These races are called conditions races and offer the biggest purses. There is another category of races called handicap races where each horse is assigned a different weight to carry based on its ability. Besides the weight they carry, horses' performance can also be influenced by position relative to the inside barrier, sex, jockey, and training.\nJump racing.\nJump (or jumps) racing in Great Britain and Ireland is known as National Hunt racing (although, confusingly, National Hunt racing also includes flat races taking place at jumps meetings; these are known as National Hunt flat races). Jump racing can be subdivided into steeplechasing and hurdling, according to the type and size of obstacles being jumped. The word \"steeplechasing\" can also refer collectively to any type of jump race in certain racing jurisdictions, particularly in the United States.\nTypically, horses progress to bigger obstacles and longer distances as they get older, so that a European jumps horse will tend to start in National Hunt flat races as a juvenile, move on to hurdling after a year or so, and then, if thought capable, move on to steeplechasing.\nHarness racing.\nA type of racing where horses go around a track while pulling a sulky and a driver behind them. In this sport, Standardbreds are used. These horses are separated into two categories, trotters and pacers. Pacers move the legs on each side of their body in tandem, while trotters move their diagonal legs together. Pacers are typically faster than trotters. Occasionally a horse will break their gait into a canter or gallop, requiring the driver to pull back and slow the horse, which might lose position or even cause disqualification. Notable races include the Hambletonian and the Breeder's Crown series.\nSaddle trot racing.\nRidden trot races are more common in places such as Europe and New Zealand. These horses are trotters who race on the flat under saddle with a jockey on their backs.\nEndurance racing.\nThe length of an endurance race varies greatly. Some are relatively short, at ten miles, while other races can be up to one hundred miles. There are a few races that are even longer than one hundred miles and last multiple days. These different lengths of races are divided into five categories: pleasure rides (10\u201320 miles), non-competitive trail rides (21\u201327 miles), competitive trail rides (20\u201345 miles), progressive trail rides (25\u201360 miles), and endurance rides (40\u2013100 miles in one day, up to in multiple days). Because each race is very long, trails of natural terrain are generally used.\nContemporary organized endurance racing began in California around 1955, and the first race marked the beginning of the Tevis Cup. This race was a one-hundred-mile, one-day-long ride starting in Squaw Valley, Placer County, and ending in Auburn. Founded in 1972, the American Endurance Ride Conference was the United States' first national endurance riding association. The longest endurance race in the world is the Mongol Derby, which is long.\nBreeds.\nIn most horse races, entry is restricted to certain breeds; that is, the horse must have a sire (father) and a dam (mother) who are studbook-approved individuals of whatever breed is racing. For example, in a normal harness race, the horse's sire and dam must both be pure Standardbreds. The exception to this is in Quarter Horse racing, where an Appendix Quarter Horse may be considered eligible to race against (standard) Quarter Horses. The designation of \"Appendix\" refers to the addendum section, or Appendix, of the Official Quarter Horse registry. An Appendix Quarter Horse is a horse that has either one Quarter Horse parent and one parent of any other eligible breed (such as Thoroughbred, the most common Appendix cross), two parents that are registered Appendix Quarter Horses, or one parent that is a Quarter Horse and one parent that is an Appendix Quarter Horse. AQHA also issues a \"Racing Register of Merit\", which allows a horse to race on Quarter Horse tracks, but not be considered a Quarter Horse for breeding purposes (unless other requirements are met).\nA stallion with a good pedigree who has won many races may be put to stud when he is retired, and fillies and mares of merit may become broodmares. While artificial insemination, intracytoplasmic sperm injection, embryo transfer and other advanced reproductive technologies, along with DNA identification have expanded options for horses of most breeds, Thoroughbred registry requires live cover breeding.\nPedigrees of stallions are recorded in various books and websites, such as \"Weatherbys Stallion Book\", the \"Australian Stud Book\" and \"Thoroughbred Heritage\".\nThoroughbred.\nThere are three founding sires that all Thoroughbreds can trace back to: the Darley Arabian, the Godolphin Arabian, and the Byerley Turk, named after their respective owners Thomas Darley, Lord Godolphin, and Captain Robert Byerley. They were taken to England, where they were bred with mares from English and imported bloodlines. The resultant foals were the first generation of thoroughbreds, and all modern thoroughbreds are their descents. Thoroughbreds range in height from as small as 15 hands (a hand being four inches) to over 17 hands. Thoroughbreds can travel medium distances at fast paces, requiring a balance between speed and endurance. Thoroughbreds may be bay, black, dark bay/brown, chestnut, gray, roan, white or palomino. Artificial insemination, cloning and embryo transfer are not allowed in the Thoroughbred breed.\nStandardbred.\nThe standardbred is a breed of horse used for a variety of purposes, but they are largely bred for harness racing. They are descended from Thoroughbreds, Morgans, and extinct breeds. Standardbreds are typically docile and easy to handle. They do not spook easily and are quite versatile in what they can do, with an active post-racing career program by the United States Trotting Association.\nArabian horse.\nThe Arabian horse was developed by the Bedouin people of West Asia specifically for stamina over long distances, so they could outrun their enemies. It was not until 1725 that the first Arabian horses were brought to North America, and not until about the time of the Civil War that they were bred as purebreds. Until the formation in 1908 of the Arabian Horse Club of America (becoming the Arabian Horse Registry of America in 1969), Arabians were recorded with the Jockey Club in a separate subsection from Thoroughbreds.\nArabians must be able to withstand traveling long distances at a moderate pace. They have an abundance of slow twitch (type I muscle fibers), enabling their muscles to work for extended periods of time. This is in contrast to the larger fast twitch (type II) muscle fibers that predominate in the Quarter Horse, which allow for short bursts of explosive speed but poor endurance. The Arabian is primarily used today in endurance racing but is also raced over traditional race tracks in many countries.\nArabian Horse Racing is governed by the International Federation of Arabian Horse Racing.\nQuarter Horse.\nThe ancestors of the Quarter Horse were prevalent in America in the early 17th century. These horses were a blend of Colonial Spanish horses crossed with English horses that were brought over in the 1700s. The native horse and the English horse were bred together, resulting in a compact, muscular horse. At this time, they were mainly used for chores such as plowing and cattle work. The American Quarter Horse was not recognized as an official breed until the formation of the American Quarter Horse Association in 1940.\nIn order to be successful in racing, Quarter Horses need to be able to propel themselves forward at extremely fast sprinter speed. The Quarter Horse has much larger hind limb muscles than the Arabian, which make it less suitable for endurance racing. It also has more type II-b muscle fibers, which allow the Quarter Horse to accelerate rapidly.\nWhen Quarter Horse racing began, it was very expensive to lay a full mile of track so it was agreed that a straight track of four hundred meters, or one-quarter of a mile, would be laid instead. It became the standard racing distance for Quarter Horses and inspired their name. With the exception of the longer, distance contests, Quarter Horse races are run flat out, with the horses running at top speed for the duration. There is less jockeying for position, as turns are rare, and many races end with several contestants grouped together at the wire. The track surface is similar to that of Thoroughbred racing and usually consists of dirt.\nIn addition to the three main racing breeds above and their crosses, horse racing may be conducted using various other breeds: Appaloosa, American Paint Horse, Selle Fran\u00e7ais, AQPS and Korean Jeju.\nHorse breeds and muscle structure.\nMuscles are bundles of contractile fibers that are attached to bones by tendons. These bundles have different types of fibers within them, and horses have adapted over the years to produce different amounts of these fibers.\nTraining.\nThe conditioning program for the horses varies depending on the race length. Genetics, training, age, and skeletal soundness are all factors that contribute to a horse's performance. The muscle structure and fiber type of horses depends on the breed; therefore, genetics must be considered when constructing a conditioning plan. A horse's fitness plan must be coordinated properly in order to prevent injury or lameness. If these are to occur, they may negatively affect a horse's willingness to learn. Sprinting exercises are appropriate for training two-year-old racehorses, but the number is limited by psychological factors as well as physical. A horse's skeletal system adapts to the exercise it receives. Because the skeletal system does not reach full maturity until the horse is at least six years of age, young racehorses often suffer injuries.\nHorse racing by continent.\nNorth America.\nUnited States.\nIn the United States, Thoroughbred flat races are run on surfaces of either dirt, synthetic or turf. Other tracks offer Quarter Horse racing and Standardbred racing, on combinations of these three types of racing surfaces. Racing of other breeds, such as Arabian horse racing, is found on a limited basis. American Thoroughbred races are run at a wide variety of distances, most commonly from ; with this in mind, breeders of Thoroughbred race horses attempt to breed horses that excel at a particular distance (see dosage index).\nHorse racing in the United States and on the North American continent dates back to 1665, which saw the establishment of the Newmarket Course in Salisbury, New York, a section of what is now known as the Hempstead Plains of Long Island, New York. This first racing meet in North America was supervised by New York's colonial governor, Richard Nicolls. The area is now occupied by the present Nassau County, New York, a region of Greater Westbury and East Garden City. The South Westbury section is still known as Salisbury.\nThe first record of quarter-mile length races dated back to 1674 in Henrico County, Virginia. Each race consisted of only two horses, and they raced down the village streets and lanes. The Quarter Horse received its name from the length of the race.\nTracing back the history of horse racing in the United States to its earliest inception in 1665, this sport has become an industry contributing approximately $15 billion to the U.S. economy in 2019. Horse racing has become the second most popular spectator sport in the United States with the establishment of historic tracks like Belmont Park, major events like the Kentucky Derby, and significant institutions such as the American Stud Book.\nThe American Stud Book was started in 1868, prompting the beginning of organized horse racing in the United States. There were 314 tracks operating in the United States by 1890; and in 1894, the American Jockey Club was formed.\nThe Pleasanton Fairgrounds Racetrack at the Alameda County Fairgrounds in California is the oldest remaining horse racing track in America, dating from 1858, when it was founded by the sons of the Spaniard Don Agust\u00edn Bernal.\nBelmont Park is located at the western edge of the Hempstead Plains in New York. Its mile-and-a-half main track is the largest dirt Thoroughbred racecourse in the world, and it has the sport's largest grandstand.\nOne of the latest major horse tracks opened in the United States was the Meadowlands Racetrack in New Jersey, opening in 1977 for Thoroughbred and Harness racing. It is the home of the Meadowlands Cup. Other more recently opened tracks include Remington Park, Oklahoma City, opened in 1988, Sam Houston Race Park in the Houston metro area, opened in 1994, and Lone Star Park in the Dallas\u2013Fort Worth Metroplex, opened in 1997; the latter track hosted the prestigious Breeders' Cup series of races in 2004.\nThoroughbred horse racing in the United States has its own Hall of Fame in Saratoga Springs, New York. The Hall of Fame honors remarkable horses, jockeys, owners, and trainers.\nThe traditional high point of US horse racing is the Kentucky Derby, held on the first Saturday of May at Churchill Downs in Louisville, Kentucky. This race is known to be the \"Most Exciting Two Minutes Sports\" attracting the largest television audience of any American horse race. The Kentucky Derby, along with the Preakness Stakes (held two weeks later at Pimlico Race Course in Baltimore, Maryland) and the Belmont Stakes (held three weeks after the Preakness at Belmont Park on Long Island), form the Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing for three-year-olds. They are all held through May and the beginning of June. In recent years the Breeders' Cup races, run at the end of the year, have challenged the Triple Crown events as determiners of the three-year-old champion. The Breeders' Cup is normally held at a different track every year; however, the 2010 and 2011 editions were both held at Churchill Downs, and 2012, 2013 and 2014 races were held at Santa Anita Park. Keeneland, in Lexington, Kentucky, hosted the 2015 Breeders' Cup.\nThe corresponding Standardbred event is the Breeders Crown. There is also a Triple Crown of Harness Racing for Pacers and a Triple Crown of Harness Racing for Trotters.\nAmerican betting on horse racing is sanctioned and regulated by the state where the race is located. Simulcast betting exists across state lines with minimal oversight except the companies involved through legalized parimutuel gambling. A takeout, or \"take\", is removed from each betting pool and distributed according to state law, among the state, race track and horsemen. A variety of factors affect takeout, namely location and the type of wager that is placed. One form of parimutuel gaming is Instant Racing, in which players bet on video replays of races.\nAdvanced Deposit Wagering (ADW) is a form of gambling on the outcome of horse races in which the bettor must fund his or her account before being allowed to place bets. ADW is often conducted online or by phone. In contrast to ADW, credit shops allow wagers without advance funding; accounts are settled at month-end. Racetrack owners, horse trainers and state governments sometimes receive a cut of ADW revenues.\nCanada.\nThe most famous racehorse from Canada is generally considered to be Northern Dancer, who after winning the Kentucky Derby, Preakness and Queen's Plate in 1964 went on to become the most successful Thoroughbred sire of the twentieth century; his two-minute-flat Derby was the fastest on record until Secretariat in 1973. The only challenger to his title of greatest Canadian horse would be his son Nijinsky II, who is the last horse to win the English Triple Crown. Woodbine Racetrack (1956) in Toronto is home of the King's Plate (1860), Canada's premier Thoroughbred stakes race, and the North America Cup (1984), Canada's premier Standardbred stakes race. It is the only race track in North America which stages Thoroughbred and Standardbred (harness) meetings on the same day. The Canadian International and Woodbine Mile (1981) are Canada's most important Grade I races worth Can$1,000,000 each, and have been won by many renowned horses such as Secretariat and Wise Dan respectively. Other key races include Woodbine Oaks (1956), Prince of Wales Stakes (1929), Breeders' Stakes (1889) and Canadian Derby (1930).\nEurope.\nBelgium.\nHorse racing in Belgium takes place at three venues \u2013 Hippodrome Wellington in Ostend (opened in 1883 in honour of Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington), Hippodroom Waregem in Waregem in Flanders and Hippodrome de Wallonie in Mons, Wallonia.\nCzech Republic.\nThere are 15 racecourses in the Czech Republic, most notably Pardubice Racecourse, where the country's most famous race, the Velka Pardubicka steeplechase, has been run since 1874. However, the first official race was organized back in 1816 by Emperor Francis II near Kladruby nad Labem. The Czech horse racing season usually starts at the beginning of April and ends sometime in November. Racing takes place mostly at weekends and there is usually one meeting on a Saturday and one on Sunday. Horse races, as well as Thoroughbred horse breeding, is organized by Jockey Club Czech Republic, founded in 1919.\nFrance.\nFrance has a major horse racing industry. It is home to the famous Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe held at Longchamp Racecourse, the richest race in Europe and the third richest turf race in the world after the Japan Cup and the Everest with a prize of 4\u00a0 million Euros (approximately US$4.2\u00a0 million). Other major races include the Grand Prix de Paris, the Prix du Jockey Club (the French Derby) and the Prix de Diane. Besides Longchamp, France's other premier flat racecourses include Chantilly and Deauville. There is also a smaller but nevertheless important jumps racing sector, with Auteil Racecourse being the best known. The sport's governing body is France Galop.\nGreat Britain.\nHorse racing in Great Britain is predominantly thoroughbred flat and jumps racing. It was in Great Britain in the 17th to 19th centuries that many of the sport's rules and regulations were established. Named after Edward Smith-Stanley, 12th Earl of Derby, The Derby was first run in 1780. The race serves as the middle leg of the British Triple Crown, preceded by the 2000 Guineas and followed by the St Leger. The name \"Derby\" has since become synonymous with great races all over the world, and as such has been borrowed many times in races abroad.\nThe Grand National is the most prominent race in British culture, watched by many people who do not normally watch or bet on horse racing at other times of the year. Many of the sport's greatest jockeys, most notably Sir Gordon Richards, have been British. The sport is regulated by the British Horseracing Authority. The BHA's authority does not extend to Northern Ireland; racing in Ireland is governed on an All-Ireland basis.\nGreece.\nDespite having an ancient tradition with well-documented history, all racetracks in Greece have ceased operation due to the Greek government-debt crisis.\nHungary.\nHungary has a long-standing horse racing tradition. The first horse racing in Pest was noted on June 6, 1827. Although racing in Hungary is neither as popular nor as prestigious as it is in Western Europe, the country is notable for producing some fine international racehorses. Foremost of these is Kincsem, foaled in 1874 and the most successful Thoroughbred racehorse ever, having won 54 races in 54 starts. The country also produced Overdose, a horse who won his first 12 races, including group races in Germany and Italy, and finished fourth in the King's Stand Stakes at Royal Ascot.\nIreland.\nIreland has a rich history of horse racing; point to pointing originated there, and even today, jump racing is more popular than racing on the flat. As a result, every year Irish horse racing fans travel in huge numbers to the highlight event of the National Hunt calendar, the Cheltenham Festival, and in recent years Irish owned or bred horses have dominated the event. Ireland has a thriving Thoroughbred breeding industry, stimulated by favorable tax treatment. The world's largest Thoroughbred stud farm, Coolmore Stud, has its main site there (in addition to major operations in the U.S. and Australia).\nIn recent years, various Irish bred and trained horses achieved victory in one or more of the British 2000 Guineas, The Derby and the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe, considered the three most prestigious races in Europe. In the six runnings of the Epsom Derby between 2008 and 2013, Irish horses filled 20 of the first 30 placings, winning the race 5 times.\nItaly.\nHistorically, Italy has been one of the leading European horse-racing nations, albeit in some respects behind Great Britain, Ireland, and France in size and prestige. The late Italian horse breeder Federico Tesio was particularly notable. In recent years, however, the sport in the country has suffered a major funding crisis, culminating in its 2014 expulsion from the European Pattern.\nNetherlands.\nIn Wassenaar in the Hague there is a grass course at Duindigt.\nPoland.\nHorse racing in Poland can be dated to 1777, when a horse owned by Polish noble Kazimierz Rzewuski beat the horse of the English charg\u00e9 d'affaires, Sir Charles Whitworth, on the road from Wola to Ujazd\u00f3w Castle. The first regular horse racing was organized in 1841 on Mokot\u00f3w Fields in Warsaw by Towarzystwo Wy\u015bcig\u00f3w Konnych i Wystawy Zwierz\u0105t Gospodarskich w Kr\u00f3lestwie Polskim (in English, the Society of Horse Racing in Congress Poland). The main racetrack in Poland is Warsaw's S\u0142u\u017cewiec Racecourse. The industry was severely limited during the Communist era, when gambling, the major source of funding, was made illegal.\nSweden.\nHarness racing (also known as trotting), is a popular sport in Sweden, with significant amounts of money wagered annually.\nOceania.\nAustralia.\nHorse racing in Australia was founded during the early years of settlement and the industry has grown to be among the top three leading Thoroughbred racing nations of the world. The world-famous Melbourne Cup, the \"race that stops a nation\", has recently attracted many international entries. In country racing, records indicate that Goulburn commenced racing in 1834. Australia's first country racing club was established at Wallabadah in 1852 and the Wallabadah Cup is still held on New Year's Day (the current racecourse was built in 1898).\nIn Australia, the most famous racehorse was Phar Lap (bred in New Zealand), who raced from 1928 to 1932. Phar Lap carried 9 st 12 lb (62.5 kg) to win the 1930 Melbourne Cup. Australian steeplechaser Crisp is remembered for his battle with Irish champion Red Rum in the 1973 Grand National. In 2003\u20132005 the mare Makybe Diva (bred in Great Britain) became the only racehorse to ever win the Melbourne Cup three times, let alone in consecutive years. Still more recently, another mare, Winx. won the prestigious Cox Plate four straight times, and set a modern-era world record for most consecutive race wins by a Thoroughbred, winning the last 33 races of her career. In harness racing, Cane Smoke had 120 wins, including 34 in a single season, Paleface Adios became a household name during the 1970s, while Cardigan Bay, a pacing horse from New Zealand, enjoyed great success at the highest levels of American harness racing in the 1960s. More recently, Blacks A Fake has won four Inter Dominion Championships, making him the only horse to complete this feat in Australasia's premier harness race.\nCompetitive endurance riding commenced in Australia in 1966, when the Tom Quilty Gold Cup was first held in the Hawkesbury district, near Sydney. The Quilty Cup is considered the National endurance ride and there are now over 100 endurance events contested across Australia, ranging in distances from 80\u00a0km to 400\u00a0km. The world's longest endurance ride is the Shahzada 400\u00a0km Memorial Test which is conducted over five days traveling 80 kilometers a day at St Albans on the Hawkesbury River, New South Wales. In all endurance events there are rigorous checks by veterinarians, conducted before, during, and after the competition.\nNew Zealand.\nRacing is a long-established sport in New Zealand, stretching back to colonial times.\nHorse racing is a significant part of the New Zealand economy which in 2004 generated 1.3% of the GDP. The indirect impact of expenditures on racing was estimated to have generated more than $1.4\u00a0billion in economic activity in 2004 and created 18,300 full-time equivalent jobs. More than 40,000 people were involved in some capacity in the New Zealand racing industry in 2004. In 2004, more than one million people attended race meetings in New Zealand. There are 69 Thoroughbred and 51 harness clubs licensed in New Zealand. Racecourses are situated in 59 locations throughout New Zealand.\nThe bloodstock industry is important to New Zealand, with the export sale of horses \u2013 mainly to Australia and Asia \u2013 generating more than $120\u00a0million a year. During the 2008\u201309 racing season 19 New Zealand bred horses won 22 Group One races around the world.\nNotable thoroughbred racehorses from New Zealand include Carbine, Nightmarch, Sunline, Desert Gold and Rising Fast. Phar Lap and Tulloch were both bred in New Zealand but did not race there.\nThe most famous New Zealand standardbred horse is probably Cardigan Bay. Stanley Dancer drove the New Zealand bred horse, Cardigan Bay to win $1\u00a0million in stakes in 1968, the first harness horse to surpass that milestone in American history. Other horses of note include Young Quinn, Christian Cullen, Lazarus and the trotter Lyell Creek.\nAfrica.\nMauritius.\nOn 25 June 1812, the Champ de Mars Racecourse was inaugurated by The Mauritius Turf Club which was founded earlier in the same year by Colonel Edward A. Draper. The Champ de Mars is situated on a prestigious avenue in Port Louis, the capital city and is the oldest racecourse in the Southern Hemisphere. The Mauritius Turf Club is the second oldest active turf club in the world.\nUndeniably, racing is one of the most popular sports in Mauritius now attracting regular crowds of 20,000 people or more to the only racecourse of the island.\nA high level of professionalism has been attained in the organization of races over the last decades preserving the unique electrifying ambiance prevailing on race days at the Champ de Mars.\nMembers of the British royal family, such as Queen Elizabeth II, Princess Margaret or Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother have attended or patronized races at the Champ de Mars numerous times.\nChamp de Mars has four classic events a year such as the Duchess of York Cup, the Barb\u00e9 Cup, the Maiden Cup, and the Duke of York Cup.\nMost of the horses are imported from South Africa but some are also acquired from Australia, the United Kingdom and France.\nSouth Africa.\nHorse racing is a popular sport in South Africa that can be traced back to 1797. The first recorded race club meeting took place five years later in 1802. The national horse racing body is known as the National Horseracing Authority and was founded in 1882. The premier event, which attracts 50,000 people to Durban, is the Durban July Handicap, which has been run since 1897 at Greyville Racecourse. It is the largest and most prestigious event on the continent, with betting running into the hundreds of millions of Rands. Several July winners have gone on to win major international races, such as Colorado King, London News, and Ipi Tombe. However, the other notable major races are the Summer Cup, held at Turffontein Racecourse in Johannesburg, and The Sun Met, which is held at Kenilworth Racecourse in Cape Town.\nAsia.\nChina.\nHorse racing in one form or another has been a part of Chinese culture for millennia. Horse racing was a popular pastime for the aristocracy at least by the Zhou dynasty \u2013 4th century B.C. General Tian Ji's stratagem for a horse race remains perhaps the best-known story about horse racing in that period. In the 18th and 19th centuries, horse racing and equestrian sports in China was dominated by Mongol influences.\nThoroughbred horse racing came to China with British settlements in the middle 1800s and most notably centered around the treaty ports, including the two major race courses in Shanghai, the Shanghai Racecourse and the International Recreation Grounds (in Kiang-wan), and the racecourses of Tianjin. The Kiang-wan racecourse was destroyed in the lead-up to the Second Sino-Japanese War and the Shanghai Race Club closed in 1954. The former Shanghai Racecourse is now People's Square and People's Park and the former club building was the Shanghai Art Museum.\nAs Hong Kong and Macau are Special Administrative Region, they're exempted from the ban on gambling on mainland China. (See below)\nHorse racing was banned in the Republic of China in 1945, and the People's Republic of China maintained the ban after 1949, although allowances were made for ethnic minority peoples for whom horse sports are a cultural tradition. Speed horse racing (\u901f\u5ea6\u8d5b\u9a6c) was an event in the National Games of China, mainly introduced to cater to minority peoples, such as the Mongols. The racecourse was initially 5\u00a0km, but from 2005 (the 10th National Games) was extended to 12\u00a0km. The longer race led to deaths and injuries to participating horses in both 2005 and the 11th National Games in 2009. Also, with the entry into the sport of Han majority provinces such as Hubei, which are better funded and used Western, rather than traditional, breeding and training techniques, meant that the original purpose of the event to foster traditional horse racing for groups like the Mongols was at risk of being usurped. At the 2009 National Games, Hubei won both the gold and silver medals, with Inner Mongolia winning bronze. As a result of these factors, the event was abolished for the 12th National Games in 2013.\nClub horse racing reappeared on a small scale in the 1990s. In 2008, the China Speed Horse Race Open in Wuhan was organized as the qualification round for the speed horse race event at the National Games the next year, but was also seen by commentators as a step towards legalizing both horse racing and gambling on the races. The Wuhan Racecourse was the only racecourse that organized races in China. In 2014, the Wuhan Jockey Club organized more than 80 races. Almost all Chinese trainers and jockeys stabled in Wuhan. However, with the demise of the event at the National Games and the government not relenting from the ban on commercial racing, various racecourses built in recent years are all in a state of disuse: The Nanjing Racecourse, which previously hosted National Games equestrian events, is now used as a car park; the Beijing Jockey Club was shut down in 2008. The racecourse in Inner Mongolia has not been active since 2012.\nHorse racing eventually returned to mainland China in 2014 as a one-day, five-card event for foreign horses, trainers and jockeys. Standardized horse racing events have gradually re-emerged in China.\nHong Kong.\nThe British tradition of horse racing left its mark with the creation of one of the most important entertainment and gambling institutions in Hong Kong. Established as the Royal Hong Kong Jockey Club in 1884, the non-profit organization conducts nearly 700 races every season at the two race tracks: Happy Valley and Sha Tin.\nAll horses are imported, as Hong Kong has no breeding industry. The sport annually draws millions of dollars of tax revenue. Off-track betting is available from overseas bookmakers.\nToday, the Hong Kong Jockey Club is a cornerstone of modern Hong Kong. It donates all its profits to the Hong Kong government, charities and public institutions. It is the territory's largest taxpayer, contributing 11% of the government's revenues in 2000. In economic terms, the Hong Kong Jockey Club is an old-fashioned government-protected monopoly; all other forms of gambling are illegal in this industry.\nMacau.\nThe Macau Trotting Club started in 1980, shutting down in 1988. In 1989, the Jockey Club of Macau was established for flat racing, closing after an unsuccessful year, to be purchased again in 1990. Racing resumed in 1991, peaking in 2003\u20132004, when more races were run in Macao than in Honk Kong. Racing was discontinued in 2024.\nIndia.\nIndia's first racecourse was set up in Madras in 1777, Guindy race course. Today India has nine racetracks operated by seven racing authorities.\nIndonesia.\nIndonesia has several local horse racing traditions including West Sumatra's \"pacu kudo\" and Bima's \"pacoa jara\". Modern flats racing was first inroduced during the Dutch colonial era. Post-independance, all equestrian sports are governed by the Equestrian Association of Indonesia (PORDASI). \nJapan.\nJapan has two governing bodies that control its horseracing \u2013 the Japan Racing Association (JRA), and National Association of Racing (NAR). Between them they conduct more than 21,000 horse races a year. The JRA is responsible for horseracing events at ten major racecourses in metropolitan areas, while the NAR is responsible for various local horseracing events throughout Japan. Racing in Japan is mainly flat racing, but Japan also has jump racing and a sled-pulling race known as Ban'ei (also called Draft Racing).\nJapan's top stakes races are run in the spring, autumn, and winter. These include the country's most prominent race \u2013 the Grade 1 Japan Cup, a 2,400 m (about 1\u00bd mile) invitational turf race run every November at Tokyo Racecourse for a purse of \u00a5476\u00a0 million (about US$5.6\u00a0million), one of the richest turf races in the world. Other noted stakes races include the February Stakes, Japanese Derby, Takamatsunomiya Kinen, Yasuda Kinen, Takarazuka Kinen, Arima Kinen, Satsuki Sho, Kikka Sho, and the Tenno Sho races run in the spring and fall. Japan's top jump race is the Nakayama Grand Jump, run every April at Nakayama Racecourse.\nMalaysia.\nIn Malaysia, horse racing was introduced during the British colonial era and remains to the present day as a gambling activity. There are three race courses in Peninsular Malaysia, namely Penang Turf Club, Perak Turf Club, and Selangor Turf Club. Within and only within the turf clubs, betting on horse racing is a legal form of gambling. Racing in Peninsular Malaysia and Singapore is conducted and governed under the Rules of the Malayan Racing Association and betting in Malaysia is operated and organized by Pan Malaysian Pools Sdn Bhd. In East Malaysia, races are governed independently by the Royal Sabah Turf Club and the Sarawak Turf Club.\nMongolia.\nMongolian horse racing takes place during the Naadam festival. Mongolia does not have Thoroughbred horse racing. Rather, it has its own Mongolian style of horse racing in which the horses run for at least a distance of 25 kilometers.\nPakistan.\nHorse races are held in Pakistan at four clubs. In Lahore at Lahore Race Club, Rawalpindi at Chakri, in Karachi at Karachi Race Club, and in Gujrat at Gujrat Race Club.\nPhilippines.\nHorseracing in the Philippines began in 1867. The history of Philippine horseracing has three divisions according to the breeds of horses used. They are the Philippine-pony era (1867\u20131898), the Arabian-horse era (1898\u20131930), and the Thoroughbred-era (1935\u2013present).\nSaudi Arabia.\nHorce races are mainly held at the King Abdulaziz Racetrack, which hosts the richest thoroughbred horse race; the Saudi Cup.\nSingapore.\nHorse racing was introduced to Singapore by the British in 1843, and remained one of the legal forms of gambling after independence. It was a highly popular form of entertainment with the local Singaporean community for 181 years. Races were typically held on Friday evenings and Sundays at the Singapore Turf Club in Kranji. Horse racing also left its mark in the naming of roads in Singapore such as Race Course Road in Little India, where horse racing was first held in Singapore, and Turf Club Road in Bukit Timah where Singapore Turf Club used to be situated before moving to its final location in 1999. In-person attendance at horse races declined dramatically during the 2010s, and after the COVID-19 pandemic the 30,000-seat grandstand was regularly filled to less than 10% capacity. The racetrack was finally closed in October 2024, its land reclaimed by the government to make way for public housing.\nSouth Korea.\nHorse racing in South Korea dates back to May 1898, when a foreign language institute run by the government included a donkey race in its athletic rally. However, it wasn't until the 1920s that modern horse racing involving betting developed. The nation's first authorised club, the Chosun Racing Club, was established in 1922 and a year later, the pari-mutuel betting system was officially adopted for the first time.\nThe Korean War disrupted the development of horse racing in the country, but after the Seoul Olympics in 1988, the Olympic Equestrian Park was converted into racing facilities named Seoul Race Park, which helped the sport to develop again.\nThailand.\nThe first horse race in Thailand took place in 1897, following King Chulalongkorn's visit to Europe. Racecourses were soon established in exclusive sports clubs, most notably the Royal Bangkok Sports Club (RBSC), founded in 1901. Royal Turf Club of Thailand followed in 1916. Betting on horse races is one of the few legal forms of gambling in Thailand.\nThe sport became highly popular during the mid-twentieth century but has largely declined since then.\nTurkey.\nHorses have played an important role in Turks' lives throughout history, highlighted by a 2000 year old inscription detailing rules of horseracing, and the hippodrome of Constantinople built in AD 203. During the Ottoman Empire in the 16th century, cross-country races of about 15 miles were run.\nThe first modern horse racing dates to 1856 in \u0130zmir. After the Republic of Turkey was established in 1923 by Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk, the number of breeding and racing Arabian and Thoroughbred racehorses accelerated rapidly, especially after the beginning of the 1930s. The Jockey Club of Turkey, founded in 1950, was the turning point of both the Turkish breeding and racing industries.\nUnited Arab Emirates.\nThe big race in the UAE is the Dubai World Cup, a race with a purse of US$12 million, which was the largest purse in the world until being surpassed by the Saudi Cup, a race in Riyadh with a $20\u00a0 million purse that held its first edition in 2020. Other races include the Dubai Kahayla Classic with a purse of US$250,000.\nThe Meydan Racecourse in Dubai, reportedly the world's largest race track, opened on March 27, 2010, for the Dubai World Cup race. The race track complex contains two tracks with seating for 60,000, a hotel, restaurants, theater and a museum.\nThere is no parimutuel betting in the UAE as gambling is illegal.\nSouth America.\nArgentina.\nIn Argentina the sport is known as turf. Some of the most famous racers are Irineo Leguisamo, Vilmar Sanguinetti, Marina Lezcano, Jorge Valdivieso, Pablo Falero and Jorge Ricardo. The most notable Argentine horse of recent decades is Invasor, who won Uruguay's Triple Crown in 2005; won four U.S. Grade I races in 2006, including the Breeders' Cup Classic, on his way to being named that country's Horse of the Year; and ended his racing career in 2007 with two more Grade I/Group One wins, including the Dubai World Cup.\nCarlos Gardel's tango Por una cabeza is about horse racing, a sport of which he was a known fan. Gardel was a good friend of Irineo Leguisamo, who is the most recognized Uruguayan jockey, who raced numerous years in Argentine.\nBetting.\nAt many horse races, there is a gambling station, where gamblers can stake money on a horse. Gambling on horses is prohibited at some tracks; Springdale Race Course, home of the nationally renowned TD Bank Carolina Cup and Colonial Cup Steeplechase in Camden, South Carolina, is known as one of the tracks where betting is illegal, due to a 1951 law. Where gambling is allowed, most tracks offer parimutuel betting where gamblers' money is pooled and shared proportionally among the winners once a deduction is made from the pool. In some countries, such as the UK, Ireland, and Australia, an alternative and more popular facility is provided by bookmakers who effectively make a market in odds. This allows the gambler to 'lock in' odds on a horse at a particular time (known as 'taking the price' in the UK). Parimutuel gambling on races also provides not only purse money to participants but considerable tax revenue, with over $100\u00a0billion wagered annually in 53 countries.\nDeaths and injuries.\nAnna Waller, a member of the Department of Emergency Medicine at the University of North Carolina, co-authored a four-year-long study of jockey injuries and stated to \"The New York Times\" that \"For every 1,000 jockeys you have riding [for one year], over 600 will have medically treated injuries.\" She added that almost 20% of these were serious head or neck injuries. The study reported 6,545 injuries during the years 1993\u20131996. More than 100 jockeys were killed in the United States between 1950 and 1987.\nHorses also face dangers in racing. 1.5 horses die out of every 1,000 starts in the United States. The U.S. Jockey Club in New York estimates that about 600 horses died at racetracks in 2006. The Jockey Club in Hong Kong reported a far lower figure of 0.58 horses per 1,000 starts. There is speculation that drugs used in horse racing in the United States, which are banned elsewhere, are responsible for the higher death rate in the United States.\nIn the Canadian province of Ontario, a study of 1,709 racehorse deaths between 2003 and 2015 found that the majority of deaths were attributable to \"damage during exercise to the horses' musculoskeletal system\", including fractures, dislocations, and tendon ruptures. Mortality rates were eight times higher for thoroughbreds than standardbreds, and highest amongst young horses. The study also found that the incidence of off-track deaths was twice as high for thoroughbreds.\nIn the United Kingdom, 186 horses were killed as a direct result of racing in 2019. Of these 145 died in National Hunt (jump) racing and 41 in flat racing. A report published in 2005 estimated that \"around 375 horses who are entered into races each season die from their injuries, or they are killed because they are considered of no further commercial value, even though they are young enough to continue racing.\" It added, \"Reasons for horses being destroyed include broken legs, back, neck and pelvis; fatal spinal injuries, exhaustion, heart attack, and burst blood vessels in the lungs.\"\nIn Australia, a 2025 analysis by The Guardian reported that at least 174 racehorses died from racing or training-related injuries in the previous 12 months, based on a report released through the Coalition for the Protection of Racehorses (CPR) on Tuesday. The report noted that 138 horses died or were euthanised due to injuries sustained during races or training sessions. 85% of the deaths recorded were from front limb fatal injury.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Rice played his entire 16-year MLB career for the Boston Red Sox. In 2009, Rice was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame.\nRice was an eight-time American League (AL) All-Star and was named the AL's Most Valuable Player in 1978 after becoming the first major league player in 19 years to hit for 400 total bases. He went on to become the ninth player to lead the major leagues in total bases in consecutive seasons. He joined Ty Cobb as one of two players to lead the AL in total bases three consecutive seasons. He batted above .300 seven times during his 16 season career, and collected 100+ runs batted in (RBI) eight times. Rice also had 200 hits in four seasons, and 20+ home runs 11 times. He also led the league in home runs three times, RBIs and slugging percentage twice each, and averaged more than 117 hits for every 100 regular season MLB games he had played in during his career. Between 1975 and 1986, Rice led all major league players in hits, RBIs and total bases, as well as all AL players in home runs and runs scored.\nFrom 1975 through 1980 he was part of one of the sport's great outfields along with Fred Lynn and Dwight Evans (who was his teammate for his entire career); Rice continued the tradition of his predecessors Ted Williams and Carl Yastrzemski as a power-hitting left fielder who played his entire career for the Red Sox. He ended his career with a .502 slugging percentage, and then ranked tenth in AL history with 382 home runs; his career marks in homers, hits (2,452), RBI (1,451) and total bases (4,129) remain Red Sox records for a right-handed hitter, with Evans eventually surpassing his Boston records for career runs scored, at bats and extra base hits by a right-handed hitter. When Rice retired, his 1,503 career games in left field ranked seventh in AL history.\nNotable seasons.\nIn the minor leagues, Rice's three-run home run was the key blow in helping the Pawtucket Red Sox (International League) defeat the Tulsa Oilers (American Association) in a 5\u20132 win in the 1973 Junior World Series. After he was AAA's International League Rookie of the Year, Most Valuable Player and Triple Crown winner in 1974, he and fellow rookie teammate Fred Lynn were brought up to the Red Sox at the same time, and were known as the \"Gold Dust Twins\". \nRice was promoted in the Red Sox organization to be a full-time player in 1975, and finished in second place for the American League's Rookie of the Year honors, and third in the Most Valuable Player voting, after he finished the season with 174 base hits, 102 runs batted in, a .309 batting average and 22 home runs; Lynn won both awards(145 games with the Red Sox, he batted .331 with 21 home runs and 105 RBIs). The Red Sox won the AL's East Division, but Rice did not play in either the League Championship Series or World Series because of a wrist injury sustained in the last week of the regular season when he was hit by a pitch. The Red Sox went on to lose the World Series four games to three to the Cincinnati Reds of the National League (NL).\nWhen the 1977 season ended, Rice found himself leading the AL in three different offensive categories. His 39 home runs was tops in the league; the first time he led the league in this statistic. He also led the league with a .593 slugging average and 392 total bases, the most by an AL player in 39 years.\nIn 1978, after having the best season in his career , Rice won the American League's Most Valuable Player award in a campaign where he hit .315 (third in the league) and led the league in home runs (46), RBI (139), hits (213), triples (15), total bases (406, and slugging percentage (.600). Altogether he led the AL in 11 different categories that season, one shy of tying the Major league record of 12 set in 1921 by Rogers Hornsby. Rice is one of two AL players ever to lead his league in triples and home runs in the same season. He also remains the only player to lead the major leagues in triples, home runs and RBIs in the same season. His 406 total bases that year is still a Red Sox record, and was the most in the AL since Joe DiMaggio had 418 in 1937. He was the first major leaguer with 400 or more total bases since Hank Aaron in 1959. This feat was not repeated until 1997, when Larry Walker had 409 in the NL. No AL player has done it since Rice in 1978, and his total remains the third highest by an AL right-handed hitter, behind DiMaggio and Jimmie Foxx (438 in 1932).\nRice had another superb season in 1979. Beside having his third season with over 200 hits, he had finished in the top three in eight different AL batting categories. He finished third in runs scored and second in home runs, RBIs, hits, slugging average, runs created, and extra base hits. He also led the league in total bases for the third straight time, and had the fourth-highest AL Batting Average. He is the only player in MLB history with three consecutive years of having at least 200 hits and 39 home runs while batting at least .315 in each of those years.\nAt the end of the 1983 season Rice led the AL in four categories including home runs, RBIs, total bases, and grounding into double plays. He had tied Milwaukee Brewers player George Scott's (1975) record and became the second player to lead the AL in those categories in the same season. In 2012 Miguel Cabrera, a Detroit Tiger, became the third AL player to reach this mark; no NL player has ever led that league in these three categories in the same year.\nIn 1986, Rice had 200 hits, batted .324, and had 110 RBIs. The Red Sox made it to the World Series for the second time during his career. This time, Rice played in all 14 postseason games, where he collected 14 hits, including two home runs. He also scored 14 runs and drove in six. His 14 runs scored is the fifth most by an individual during a single year's postseason play. The Red Sox went on to lose the World Series to the New York Mets, four games to three, the fourth consecutive Series appearance by Boston which they lost in seven games.\nCareer accomplishments.\nRice led the AL in home runs three times (1977, 1978, 1983), in RBIs twice (1978, 1983), in slugging percentage twice (1977, 1978), and in total bases four times (1977\u20131979, 1983). In fact, his 1157 total bases over the three consecutive seasons leading the league ties him for seventh place with Rogers Hornsby and is five total bases shy of Babe Ruth's three year mark of 1162 total bases. Rice also picked up Silver Slugger Awards in 1983 and 1984 (the award was created in 1980). Rice hit at least 39 home runs in a season four times, had eight 100-RBI seasons and four seasons with over 200 hits, and batted over .300 seven times. He finished his MLB career with a .298 batting average, 373 doubles, 79 triples, 382 home runs, 1,451 RBIs, 1,249 runs scored, 2,452 hits, 670 walks, and 4,129 total bases. He was an American League All-Star eight times (1977\u20131980, 1983\u20131986). In addition to winning the American League MVP award in 1978, he finished in the top five in MVP voting five other times (1975, 1977, 1979, 1983, 1986).\nRice is the only player in history to lead the league in home runs, RBIs, and triples in the same year. He is also the only player in major league history to record over 200 hits while hitting 39 or more home runs for three consecutive years. He had tied the AL record of leading the league in total bases for three straight seasons. Beside being one of three AL players to have three straight seasons of hitting at least 39 home runs while batting .315 or higher. Also in 1978, Rice became the fourth and final MLB player to lead both leagues at the same time in hitting the most Home Runs and having the most Hits in the same season. During his most productive 12-season span from 1975 to 1986, Rice collectively led all American League players in total games played, at bats, runs scored, hits, homers, RBIs, slugging percentage, total bases, extra base hits, go-ahead RBIs, multi-hit games, and outfield assists. Among all other MLB players, including those in the National League, Rice was the leader in five of the above 12 categories (Mike Schmidt is next on the leader board; he led in four).\nIn 1982, Rice saved a young fan's life. Boston was playing the Chicago White Sox. Dave Stapleton hit a line drive into the stands, and as this was before any safety measures, such as netting, were in place, the line drive hit a young boy in the head. Jim Rice, knowing it would take too long for medical staff to reach the young fan, popped out of the dugout, grabbed the young fan, and brought him to the dugout, where the Boston Red Sox medical staff was able to attend to him quickly. Due to Rice's decisive action, the boy was able to be rushed to the hospital and had emergency surgery, and ultimately, according to the physicians who treated the boy at the hospital, Rice saved the boy's life. Rice continued to play the game in his blood-stained uniform.\nIn 1984 Rice set a major league single-season record by hitting into 36 double plays. On the backside of a 1964 Topps baseball card of Earl Wilson No. 503, Goose Goslin, who got his start in 1921, was credited with grounding into 48 double plays in a season during his career. However, this mark was not followed closely until the mid to late 1930s. Rice's 315 career double plays grounded into ranks him tied in eighth place on the career leaders list with Eddie Murray. Rice did break Brooks Robinson's AL record for GIDP by a right-handed hitter (297) in 1988. Cal Ripken Jr. eventually surpassed this mark in 1999. Rice had led the league for four seasons (1982\u20131985), which tied the major league record that had been established by Ernie Lombardi. In 2009 Miguel Tejada recorded his fifth season leading his league in this category and now holds this record. During the time Rice was the annual GDP leader he also had averaged 112 RBI's per season which is ten RBI's better than second place Albert Pujols RBI average of 102 following his four-year GDP leadership. The on-base prowess of Rice's teammates placed him in a double play situation over 2,000 times during his career. Rice posted a batting average of .310 and slugging percentage of .515 in those situations which is better than his overall career marks in those categories.\nDuring his career Rice played in 35 games where he hit two or more HRs, and drove in four or more runs in a game 48 times. He could hit for both power and average, and currently only 12 other retired players rank ahead of him in both career home runs and batting average: Hank Aaron, Jimmie Foxx, Lou Gehrig, Willie Mays, Stan Musial, Mel Ott, Babe Ruth, Ted Williams, Chipper Jones, Vladimir Guerrero, Mike Piazza, and Larry Walker. In 1981, Lawrence Ritter and Donald Honig included him in their book \"The 100 Greatest Baseball Players of All Time\".\nRice was an accomplished left fielder, finishing his career with a fielding percentage of .980 and 137 outfield assists (comparable to Ted Williams' figures of .974 and 140). Although he did not possess great speed, he had a strong throwing arm and was able to master the various caroms that balls took from the Green Monster (in left field) in Fenway Park. His 21 assists in 1983 remains the most by a Red Sox outfielder since 1944, when Bob Johnson had 23. Aside from playing 1,543 games as an outfielder during his career, Rice also appeared as a designated hitter in 530 games.\nRice's number 14 was retired by the Red Sox in a pre-game ceremony on July 28, 2009.\nCommunity activities.\nRice was associated with a variety of charitable organizations during his career, primarily on behalf of children, some of which carried on into his retirement. He was named an honorary chairman of The Jimmy Fund, the fundraising arm of the Dana\u2013Farber Cancer Institute in Boston, in 1979, and in 1992 was awarded that organization's \"Jimmy Award,\" which honors individuals who demonstrate their dedication to cancer research. Rice is also active in his support of the Neurofibromatosis Foundation of New England. Rice's involvement with Major League Baseball's RBI program (Reviving Baseball in Inner Cities) resulted in the naming of a new youth baseball facility in Roxbury, Massachusetts, in his honor in 1999. A youth recreation center in Rice's hometown of Anderson, South Carolina, is also named in his honor.\nDuring a nationally televised game on August 7, 1982, Rice rushed into the stands to help a young boy struck in the head by a line drive hit by Dave Stapleton. Rice left the dugout and entered the stands to help four-year-old Jonathan Keane, who was bleeding heavily. Rice carried the boy onto the field, through the Red Sox dugout, and into the clubhouse, where he was treated by the team's medical staff. Rice's swift response likely saved Keane's life, as paramedics would likely not have arrived in time. Rice also paid the hospital bill, and Keane made a full recovery from the injury.\nRetirement activities.\nIn 1990, Rice agreed to play for the St. Petersburg Pelicans of the short-lived Senior Professional Baseball Association. After, Rice served as a roving batting coach (1992\u20131994) and hitting instructor (1995\u20132000), and remains an instructional batting coach (2001\u2013present) with the Red Sox organization. While the Red Sox hitting coach, the team led the league in hitting in 1997 and players won two batting titles. Rice was the hitting coach for the American League in the 1997 and 1999 Major League Baseball All-Star Games, both under the same manager, the New York Yankees' Joe Torre. Since 2003, he's also been employed as a commentator for the New England Sports Network (NESN), where he contributes to the Red Sox pre-game and post-game shows. He had a cameo appearance in the NESN movie \"Wait 'til This Year\" and in the film \"Fever Pitch\". The former slugger has been known to pass his wisdom on to the current Sox players and stars from time to time. Rice was elected to the Boston Red Sox Hall of Fame when it was established in 1995 and is the 40th member of Ted Williams' Museum and Hitters Hall of Fame, inducted with Paul Molitor, Dave Winfield and Robin Yount in 2001. On November 29, 2008, the Boston chapter of the Baseball Writers' Association of America (BBWAA) announced that Rice would receive the Emil Fuchs Award for long and meritorious service to baseball.\nDuring his Hall of Fame acceptance speech Rice revealed that he is a devoted fan of \"The Young and the Restless,\" noting that he was watching the show when he was informed of his election into Cooperstown.\nHall of Fame.\nWhile Rice was generally regarded as one of the better hitters of his era based upon statistics traditionally used by the BBWAA to evaluate players' Hall of Fame qualifications, he was not elected until his 15th and final year of eligibility, netting 76.4% of the votes, in 2009. Over the years he was on the BBWAA ballot, he received 3,974 total votes, the most collected by any player voted on for baseball's highest honor. In 2006 and 2007, he received over 63% of votes cast. Rice just missed being elected in 2008 when the count found him on 72.2% of the ballots, only 2.8% short of the required 75%. Rice became the fourth enshrinee inducted into the Hall of Fame on his last chance on the BBWAA ballot and the first since Ralph Kiner in 1975.\nRice's delay in election to the Hall of Fame stemmed in part from more current statistical analysis of player performance which suggested that his HOF credentials might have been more questionable than they were considered during his career. The delay may also have been related to his often difficult relationship with the media during his playing career, many of whom are still voting members of the BBWAA, and his career fading relatively early \u2013 he last played in the major leagues at age 36. Some writers, such as the \"Boston Herald\"'s Sean McAdam, said that Rice's chances improved with the exposure of the \"Steroids Era\" in baseball. In the same article, McAdam expanded this subject by adding: \"In an era when power numbers are properly viewed with a healthy dose of suspicion, Rice's production over the course of his 16 years gains additional stature.\" As such, he received increasingly more votes each year since the 2003 ballot, improving his vote totals by 133 over the last five years on the ballot. However, from several sabermetric standpoints it can be argued that Rice falls short of his peers in the Hall of Fame. Nevertheless, several commentators note that the continued criticism of Rice's statistics not meeting sabermetric standards was unfair since several other Hall of Fame players, notably Andre Dawson and Tony P\u00e9rez, fare even worse against such standards.\nDuring the 2007 season, the Pawtucket Red Sox started a campaign to get Rice inducted which included having fans sign \"the World's Largest Jim Rice Jersey.\u201d\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "74724", "revid": "20957809", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=74724", "title": "Horse racing in Great Britain", "text": "Horse racing is the second largest spectator sport in Great Britain, and one of the longest established, with a history dating back many centuries. According to a report by the British Horseracing Authority it generates \u00a33.39 billion total direct and indirect expenditure in the British economy, of which \u00a31.05 billion is from core racing industry expenditure, and the major horse racing events such as Royal Ascot and Cheltenham Festival are important dates in the British and international sporting and society calendar.\nThe sport has taken place in the country since Roman times and many of the sport's traditions and rules originated there. The Jockey Club, established in 1750, codified the \"Rules of Racing\" and one of its members, Admiral Rous laid the foundations of the handicapping system for horse racing, including the weight-for-age scale. Britain is also home to racecourses including Newmarket, Ascot and Cheltenham and races including The Derby at Epsom, The Grand National and Cheltenham Gold Cup. Great Britain has also produced some of the greatest jockeys, including Fred Archer, Sir Gordon Richards and Lester Piggott.\nBritain has also historically been a hugely important centre for thoroughbred racehorse breeding. In fact all racehorses are called English Thoroughbred, the breed having been created in England. All modern thoroughbred racehorses can trace a line back to three foundation sires which were imported to Britain in the late 17th/early 18th centuries and the General Stud Book first published by James Weatherby still records details of every horse in the breed.\nGambling on horseraces has been one of the cornerstones of the British betting industry and the relationship between the two has historically been one of mutual dependence. The betting industry is an important funder of horse racing in Great Britain, through the betting levy administered by the Horserace Betting Levy Board and through media rights negotiated by racecourses and betting shops.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC_right/styles.css\" /&gt;\nTypes of racing.\nThere are two main forms of horse racing in Great Britain. \nCollectively, the above racing is often referred to as racing \"under rules\", since there is another form of racing which is run on an altogether more informal and \"ad hoc\" basis, known as point-to-point racing. Point-to-point is a form of steeplechasing for amateur riders.\nAll the above forms of the sport are run under the auspices of the governing and regulatory body for horse racing in Great Britain, the British Horseracing Authority. with the exception of point-to-pointing which is administered by the Point-to-Point Authority with the BHA taking on regulatory functions. There is also a limited amount of harness racing which takes place under the auspices of the British Harness Racing Society and Arabian racing which takes place under the auspices of the Arabian Racing Organisation.\nHistory.\nRoman era to Middle Ages.\nHorses were used as beasts of burden in pre-Roman times, but it is thought that the first horse races to take place in Britain were organised by soldiers of the Roman Empire in Yorkshire around 200 AD, although whether the Romans actually introduced the sport is a matter of conjecture. It is believed that Romans at the encampment at Wetherby matched horses against Arabian horses brought to England by Emperor Septimius Severus. Traces of racecourses dating to the Roman occupation exist, but records are scarce.\nThe Venerable Bede reports that the English began to saddle their horses about the year 631.\nThe earliest written mention of \"running-horses\" is a record of Hugh, from the French House of Capet, gifting some as a present to King Athelstan of England in the 9th/10th century. During Athelstan's reign a ban was placed on the export of English horses, such was supposed to be their superiority to continental ones. Continental ones were still permitted for import, and many were brought to England by William the Conqueror. Roger de Montgomerie, 1st Earl of Shrewsbury introduced Spanish stallions to the country.\nThe first recorded race meetings were during the reign of Henry II at Smithfield, London, during the annual St Bartholomew's horse fair. The event is attested by William Fitzstephen writing at some time after 1174 and the poet Drayton. \nDuring the Crusades, horse-breeding improved and horseback contests were popular, but in the form of tournaments, rather than races. King John established a stud at Eltham, Kent and the Middle English romance Sir Bevis of Hampton has couplets which refer to races taking place in the time of Richard I.\nFor the next three centuries there are numerous records of Kings of England keeping 'running horses'. Edward III bought horses at \u00a313 6s 8d each, and was also gifted two by the King of Navarre. The royal stud continued to grow throughout the reign of Henry VII.\n16th Century.\nRecords become more substantial during the time of Henry VIII. He passed a number of laws relating to the breeding of horses and also imported a large number of stallions and mares for breeding from Spain, Italy and the East. He kept a training establishment at Greenwich and the stud at Eltham. and founded the Royal Paddock at Hampton Court, where he kept mares and a \"Barb worth his weight in silver\", which has been given to him by the Marquis of Mantua.\nFormal race meetings began to be instigated too. It is believed that the first occurrence of a trophy being presented to the winner of a race was in 1512 by organisers of a fair in Chester and was a small wooden ball decorated with flowers. Meanwhile, the oldest horse race still in existence, the Kiplingcotes Derby was first run in 1519. The Carlisle Bells, reputedly the oldest sporting trophy in the world, were first competed for in the 16th century, in a race that still bears their name. One of the bells is inscribed \"The sweftes horse thes bel tak\" (\"The swiftest horse takes this bell\").\nRacing was firmly established at Chester, the oldest surviving racecourse in England, by 1540. By the time of Elizabeth, the sport was a \"common amusement\", and the Queen herself is recorded as attending races on Salisbury Plain in the 1580s, as well as keeping up the paddocks at Hampton and founding her own at Blackheath. Racing in the Forest of Galtres dates to 1590, Leith Races were established by 1591, and at Doncaster by 1595.\n17th century.\nDuring Elizabeth's reign, interest in horse racing appears to have waned, for reasons unrecorded, but this changed when in 1605, James I discovered the little village of Newmarket whilst out hawking or riding. He began to spend time there racing horses, and from then on it has been known as the home of horse racing in England. In fact, James built a palace and spent so much time there that the House of Commons petitioned him to concentrate more of his time on running the country. The region has had a long association with horses going back to the time of Boudica and the Iceni. The first recorded race there was a match for \u00a3100 between horses owned by Lord Salisbury and Marquess of Buckingham in 1622, and the racecourse was founded in 1636.\nChester continued to be a centre of the sport and by 1609 there are records of the St George's race being run five time round the \"Roody\" for a prize of silver bells and a sum of money. The first known Rules of Racing date from Kiplingcotes in 1619. Race meetings began to spring up elsewhere in the country. Races were run for silver bells at Gatherley, near Richmond in Yorkshire, Croydon and Theobalds on Enfield Chase. Jockey weights began to be measured and rigorously enforced, and formal training of horses took place, paying attention to food and exercise.\nJames VI and I encouraged the sport. Some of the Spanish horses that ended up in Galloway after the wrecking of the Spanish Armada were kept by local people and raced against the King's own horses when he was in Ireland. They proved better than the King's and were bought for the royal stables. The King supported several meetings, even acting as Clerk of the Course at Lincoln in 1607 and built a house at Newmarket as a hunting lodge and so he could enjoy the racing there. Private match races between gentlemen, riding their own horses, rather than using hired jockeys as became the norm later, became commons.\nAround the time that Charles I of England came to the throne, Spring and Autumn race meetings were introduced to Newmarket and in 1634 the first Gold Cup event was held. Charles gave a 100 guinea silver cup to be raced for at Hyde Park, and instituted a silver plate at Newmarket. Meetings at Stamford and Epsom were now well established.\nAll horse racing was then banned in 1654 by Oliver Cromwell, and many horses were requisitioned by the state. Despite this Cromwell himself kept a stud running of his own. With the restoration of Charles II racing flourished and he instituted the Newmarket Town Plate in 1664, writing the rules himself:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n\"Articles ordered by His Majestie to be observed by all persons that put in horses to ride for the Plate, the new round heat at Newmarket set out on the first day of October, 1664, in the 16th year of our Sovereign Lord King Charles II, which Plate is to be rid for yearly, the second Thursday in October for ever\"\nKing Charles II, Rules of the Newmarket Town Plate\nWilliam III founded a riding academy and gave plates to be ridden for in many parts of the country. Between 1695 and 1702, he ran his own horses at Newmarket, including in a 2000 guinea match against the Duke of Somerset. The influential Tregonwell Frampton, known as the \"Father of the Turf\" was keeper of William's horses, and performed the same task for Queen Anne, George I and possibly Charles II and James II. He did much to improve the breed.\nThe three foundation sires of the modern thoroughbred, the Byerley Turk, Darley Arabian and Godolphin Barb were imported to England in the late 17th and early 18th centuries and founded the lines which can be traced down to every modern thoroughbred racehorse. At this point, they weren't the only influential sires. Others, including the grey Barb donated by the King to a Mr Hutton, and known as Hutton's Grey Barb contributed importantly to the breed.\n The improvement of the breed was not purely for sporting purposes though. Warfare and conquest were also factors. As Whyte noted, \"to the excellence of the British horse... may be ascribed much of our superiority over other nations, both in commerce and in war.\"\n18th century.\nIn the early 18th century, Queen Anne kept a large string of horses and was instrumental in the founding of Royal Ascot where the opening race each year is still called the Queen Anne Stakes. The first published account of race results was John Cheney's \"Historical list of all the Horse Matches run, and all plates and prizes run for in England and Wales\" which dates to 1727. The Weatherby family succeeded Cheney as the keepers of the most complete set of racing records, and in a later work which came into their possession, published in York in 1748, the result is recorded of a race run in September 1709 on Clifton and Rawcliffe Ings, near York, for a gold cup of \u00a350.\nIn 1740, Parliament introduced an act \"to restrain and to prevent the excessive increase in horse racing\"; this was largely ignored and in the 1750 the Jockey Club was formed to create and apply the Rules of Racing. However, until the 1760s, individual horses seldom ran more than five or six times, due to the scarcity of prizes on offer, but this began to change with major race meetings expanding the prizes on offer. Newmarket and York led the way in this.\nRaces were still generally for mature horses, and were typically run in matches, or in best-of-three heats over long distances.\nThree-year-old races were first run in 1731 and two-year-olds raced for the first time at Newmarket in 1769. In 1791, Cash became the first yearling to race, and beat a three-year-old in a match at Newmarket, in receipt of 3 stones.\nNewmarket itself continued to grow as a centre of racing and many of the racecourse's historic meetings (with persist to this day) were established in the 1760s and 1770s.\nBy the end of the century the 12th Earl of Derby and Sir Charles Bunbury were key influencers in the sport. Under their auspices the Derby and Oaks were established at Epsom, inspired by the St Leger and the growing popularity of shorter races, for younger horses. These races, along with the Leger and the Guineas at Newmarket (which were established early in the 19th century) became known as the Classics.\nAt around the same time, jockeys began to earn a reputation in their own right, with early pioneers including Frank Buckle, Sam Chifney Sr and Jem Robinson.\n19th century.\nInterest in the sport was at a high throughout the 18th and 19th centuries. As Whyte's History of the English Turf noted in 1840, \"For nearly a century and a half, the \"Turf\" has formed a favourite amusement of \"Kings, Lords and Commons\". Or as Rice's History reported in 1879, \"for some two hundred years the pursuit of Horse-racing has been attractive to more of our countrymen than any other out-door pastime\" Other traditional rural sports, including hawking, shooting and hare-hunting, had much diminished by this period, due to enclosure and \"gradual refinement of manners\" and racing was at its \"acme\".\nHandicap races, in which horses are assigned weights to carry in proportion to their ability, became popular from the turn of the 19th century onwards. The first had been run at Ascot in 1791 and others followed. Many have persisted to this day including the Chester Cup (from 1824), Northumberland Plate (1833), Cesarewitch and Cambridgeshire Handicaps at Newmarket (both 1839), Goodwood's Stewards' Cup (1839), the Ebor at York (1843), the City and Suburban Handicap at Epsom (1851) and the traditional opener for the flat racing season, the Lincoln (1853).\nSteeplechasing first became organised by Tom Colman at St Albans in the early 1830s. By the end of that decade, the Grand National had been established at Aintree by William Lynn.\nIn 1875, Sandown Park became the first racecourse to open a separate members' enclosure.\nBy the turn of the 20th century, it was said that \"time has only strengthened and confirmed the national passion for the sport.\" Concerns over its moral effects were prevalent though. An interest in horse racing and the attendant gambling was described as the \"offspring of a passion we should wish to disown\", with a warning that \"the modern turf is fast becoming the very manor of the worst\".\n20th century to date.\nIn 1947 Hamilton hosted the first evening race meeting in Great Britain. Now Wolverhampton Racecourse holds the most evening meetings, with nearly 50 a year.\nThe Jockey Club governed the sport until its governance role was handed to the British Horseracing Board, (formed in June 1993) and while the BHB became responsible for strategic planning, finance, politics, race planning, training and marketing, the Jockey Club continued to regulate the sport. In 2006 it formed the Horseracing Regulatory Authority to carry out the regulatory process whilst it focused on owning 13 racecourses and the gallops in Newmarket and Lambourn. In July 2007 the HRA merged with the BHB to form the British Horseracing Authority.\nRacecourses.\nThere are 60 licensed racecourses in Great Britain, with a further two in Northern Ireland (Down Royal and Downpatrick). Apart from Chelmsford City and Ffos Las (which opened in 2009), all the courses date back to 1927 or earlier. The oldest is Chester Racecourse, which dates to the early 16th century.\nUnlike some other countries, which include the United States, racing in Britain usually takes place on turf. However, there are six courses which have all-weather tracks \u2013 Kempton Park, Lingfield, Southwell, Wolverhampton, Chelmsford City and Newcastle. Southwell's surface is Fibresand. Wolverhampton installed a Tapeta surface in August 2014, replacing the existing Polytrack; Newcastle converted its Gosforth Park flat racing turf track to a Tapeta course with the addition of a floodlit all-weather straight mile in May 2016. All flat racing at Newcastle now takes place on the Tapeta surface with a turf course retained solely for a winter programme of jumps racing. The other three British all-weather tracks are all Polytrack. Ireland has a single all-weather Polytrack course at Dundalk. Courses also vary wildly in layout. There are very few which are regular ovals, as is the typical layout of other countries like the United States. Each course has its own idiosyncrasies, and horses are known to be more suited to some tracks than others, hence the idiom \"horses for courses.\"\nThere are two main operating groups of British racecourses \u2013 Jockey Club Racecourses, which runs fifteen courses, and Arena Racing Company, which runs sixteen courses.\nImportant races and meetings.\nFlat.\nBritain is home to some of the world's most important flat races and race meetings. While ancient horse races like the Kiplingcotes Derby and Newmarket Town Plate are now mainly curiosities, there are many older races which retain modern relevance. The five British Classics \u2013 the 1,000 Guineas, 2,000 Guineas, The Oaks, The Derby and the St. Leger \u2013 were founded in the late 18th and early 19th centuries and still represent the pinnacle of achievement for each generation of horses. The structure and distances of these races, if not the exact names, have been adopted by many other European horse racing authorities, such as Ireland. Royal Ascot is the major flat racing festival in Europe and attracts horses from all over the world. The modern flat season in Britain now also climaxes with British Champions Day, a festival of championship races, also held at Ascot.\nNational Hunt.\nIn National Hunt racing, the Cheltenham Festival is the foremost jump racing festival in the world, and is an annual target for both British and Irish trainers. The festival hosts races such as the Cheltenham Gold Cup and Champion Hurdle, which are seen as the peak of their disciplines and over the years have been won by horses whose appeal has transcended the sport, including Kauto Star and Desert Orchid. More widely known still is the Grand National at Aintree, which despite being a very long and difficult race that is historically contested by a lower grade of horses than races at Cheltenham, has produced some of the sports equine superstars, like Red Rum. It has an estimated global audience of 600 million viewers.\nMedia coverage.\nNewspapers.\nBritish horse racing is served by a daily, national newspaper, the \"Racing Post\", founded in 1986. This publication carries industry news, race cards for all British and Irish race meetings, tipping columns and betting information, as well as smaller sections on greyhound racing and general sport. There are also dedicated weekly publications including \"Racing Plus\" and monthly magazines such as \"Thoroughbred Owner &amp; Breeder\". In addition, there is a limited amount of racing coverage in broader equestrian magazines, such as \"Horse &amp; Hound\". Many national dailies also carry racing news and information in their sports pages.\nAt various times in history, there has been more than one racing daily, and fierce rivalries have existed between them. For most of the 20th century, the \"Sporting Life\" and \"Sporting Chronicle\" were the two competing papers, before the Manchester-based \"Chronicle\" closed in 1983 due to debts and falling circulation. The \"Racing Post\" was founded in 1986 to fill the gap and challenge the \"Sporting Life\" monopoly that resulted and these two were rivals throughout the 80s and 90s. Ultimately, only the \"Post\" survived as the owners of the \"Sporting Life\", Trinity Mirror, closed the \"Life\" and took over the \"Racing Post\" trademark.\nIn the Victorian era, there was a wide range of sporting newspapers that carried racing news to a greater or lesser extent. These include \"Bell's Life in London\" (forerunner to the Sporting Life), \"The Sporting Times\" and \"The Sportsman\" (not to be confused with the short-lived 2006 newspaper of the same name). In 1840, \"Bell's Life\" is reported to compete with the \"Sunday Times\" as the two weekly turf newspapers. There were also four monthly magazines at that time \u2013 the \"Old Sporting Magazine\" (founded 1792), the \"New Sporting Magazine\" (founded 1824), the \"Sporting Review\" (founded 1837) and the \"Sportsman\" (stated to have originated in 1829, so not the same as the \"Sportsman\" above which was founded in 1865). However, coverage of horse racing in newspapers is believed to date as far back as the \"Evening English Chronicle\" in 1779.\nTelevision.\nThere are two dedicated horse racing channels on British digital television \u2013 Sky Sports Racing (free to air) and Racing TV (subscription only). Daily broadcasts of British race meetings are split between the two according to contracts arranged by racecourses and racecourse owning groups. Saturday racing and key midweek festival meetings are also broadcast on terrestrial television by ITV. The channel broadcasts a Saturday afternoon programme of live racing, usually between 13:30 and 16:00, and an hour-long weekly magazine show on Saturday mornings on ITV4. The coverage is presented by Ed Chamberlin and Oli Bell with AP McCoy, Alice Plunkett, Mick Fitzgerald and Francesca Cumani. 60 days of racing are shown on ITV4, and 40 days of racing are shown on ITV.\nITV had previously shown horse racing since its first weeks on air in 1955, and in the 1970s it provided an alternative to BBC coverage with the ITV Seven which featured as part of the channel's \"World of Sport\" programme. This lasted until the early 1980s, when coverage was gradually transferred to Channel 4. Prior to 2017, ITV had not shown any horse racing since 1988.\nFor many years, racing was also broadcast on the BBC, who pioneered coverage of the sport in the 1950s. The network retained the rights to key race meetings, such as the Grand National, Royal Ascot and the Derby until 2012 when it was outbid for the rights by Channel 4. The BBC broadcast some of the key moments in the history of British horse racing, such as Red Rum winning his third Grand National and the 1967 victory of Foinavon in the same race after most of the field fell at the same fence.\nChannel 4's covered the sport for more than thirty years. Initially it showed the midweek events which were previously shown on ITV but from late 1985 it covered all of the racing previously shown by ITV. Between 2013 and 2016, Channel 4 was the exclusive home of horse racing on terrestrial television. The last day of \"Channel 4 Racing\" was on 27 December 2016.\nAs with other sports, many of the people who have presented racing on television through the years have become inseparably linked with racing in the public consciousness. Foremost among these for many years was the BBC's Peter O'Sullevan, known as \"the voice of racing\", who commentated on fifty Grand Nationals. Channel 4's most recognisable racing figure was John McCririck, famed for his eccentric dress sense and use of the bookmakers' sign language \"tic-tac\". Other notable presenters of Channel 4's coverage included Derek Thompson, John Francome, John Oaksey and Brough Scott. Clare Balding transferred from the BBC in 2013 to become lead presenter.\nBetting.\nWagering money on horse races is as old as the sport itself, but in the United Kingdom, the links between horse racing and nationwide wagering are very strong. Betting shops are common sights in most towns, tending to be sited wherever a significant number of people with disposable cash can be expected. \nAs early as 1938, \u00a3500,000,000 was being gambled on horse racing in England according to the Christian Social Council Committee on Gambling. However, betting shops were not legalised until 1960, at which time many of the famous British betting shop chains such as William Hill, Ladbrokes and Corals were legally established on the high street. Previously, betting was either on course, via certain credit betting offices, or illegally conducted, often in or around public houses, with \"bookies runners\" ferrying the bets from bookmaker to client.\nClement Freud, a future Member of Parliament and racehorse owner, argued in a 27 October 1975 Commons debate that government policy was \u201cmilking\u201d British racing for revenue, treating it primarily as a source of tax income rather than nurturing the sport.\nBetting in the United Kingdom is taxed under the authority of various Acts of Parliament. A gross profit tax is levied on all UK-based bookmakers, payable to the Exchequer. At the same time, an additional sum is collected by the Horserace Betting Levy Board (HBLB), a non-departmental public body sponsored by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS). The HBLB uses these funds to support race prize money, integrity services, and the improvement of horse racing in Britain.\nFor the 2022\u201323 fiscal year, the levy generated approximately \u00a399 million in income for the Board, reflecting a continued recovery in betting turnover following the disruption of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nOn 6 October 2001, the UK Government abolished the turnover-based betting duty, which had previously been charged at 9% on either the stake or the winnings, at the discretion of the bettor. The reform replaced the system with a gross profits tax on bookmakers, shifting the point of taxation from the customer to the operator.\nSince 2015, the United Kingdom has experienced significant growth in online gambling, driven by widespread internet access and the expansion of mobile technology. Increasingly, punters place wagers through digital platforms that provide access to real-time data, live odds, and betting exchanges. Online communities, discussion forums, and tipping websites also allow punters to share information and strategies. The popularity of major racing events such as the Cheltenham Festival continues to draw large online participation, with hundreds of thousands of users engaging in digital betting and discussion each year.\nKey people.\nJockeys.\nIn the early days of British horse racing, owners tended to ride their own horses in races. This practice died out as racing became more organised and the owners, most of them aristocrats, had grooms ride the horses instead. Jockeys at this time were often scruffy and unkempt and not well-regarded. The 19th century racing chronicler, Nimrod, referred to the \"costume\" of the jockeys of the previous century as \"deformity personified\". Nevertheless, several Yorkshire-based jockeys became acclaimed in the mid-to-late 18th century. These included John Mangle, Bill Pierse, John Shepherd, three different individuals named John Singleton, Ben Smith and Bill Clift. Between them they won many of the early runnings of the oldest classic, the St. Leger. Their counterparts in the south became similarly celebrated, and exercised a similar dominance over the Newmarket classics. Amongst their number were Sam Chifney, Jem Robinson, the Arnull family \u2013 John, Sam and Bill \u2013 and \"the first man to bring respectability to the profession\" \u2013 Frank Buckle.\nThe 19th century was dominated by three jockeys \u2013 Nat Flatman, George Fordham and Fred Archer \u2013 who among them won forty flat jockeys' championships. With the expansion of print media and the growth of interest in horse racing among ordinary people, these jockeys became nationally recognised figures, with a profile enjoyed by the footballers and TV celebrities of today. When Archer died at his own hand, it is said:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nIn London, special editions of the evening papers were issued; crowds thronged Fleet Street to buy them and omnibuses stopped to allow passengers to read the billboards\u00a0... In tram or train, Archer's death was the sole topic of conversation. No greater interest could have been aroused had he been Prime Minister or a member of the Royal family.\n\u2013 \"Tanner &amp; Cranham, pp 78\u201379\"\nThe high profile of jockeys at this time is illustrated (literally) by the number of caricatures of jockeys that feature in Victorian society magazine, \"Vanity Fair\", alongside Members of Parliament (MPs), aristocrats and other national figures.\nThree figures dominate the flat racing scene of the 20th century too \u2013 Steve Donoghue, Gordon Richards and Lester Piggott. Richards is often regarded as the greatest jockey ever and set many records which still stand, including most flat race victories and most flat jockey championships. Piggott is descended from the great racing families of the 19th century, the Days and the Cannons.\nIn the modern day, Frankie Dettori is the jockey with the widest public profile beyond racing, appearing on Celebrity Big Brother and launching his own food range. He has also gained public attention for his feats on the racetrack, including his 'Magnificent Seven' wins at Ascot in 1997 and three jockeys' championships. Kieren Fallon was a regular champion around the turn of the century, and younger jockeys to have won multiple championships include Ryan Moore and current champion Oisin Murphy. Hayley Turner came to prominence as the first British woman to win a Group 1 race outright and as Champion Apprentice in 2005, and more recently Hollie Doyle has broken several of Turner's records and been nominated for BBC Sports Personality of the Year.\nHistorically, jumps jockeys have not had the same profile as their flat counterparts, but this changed to some extent in the 20th century. The large television audience enjoyed by the Grand National has helped in this regard. Previously unknown jockeys like 2013 winner Ryan Mania have received their first nationwide coverage as a result of the race.\nThe most-celebrated jumps jockey of all-time is the Northern Irishman Tony McCoy, winner of every Jumps Jockeys' Championship from 1995/96 until 2014/15 and the only horse racing figure to ever win the BBC Sports Personality of the Year. He broke Gordon Richards' record for most winners in a season in 2001/02 and his total number of career wins by the time he retired was 4,358, well eclipsing the numbers set by Peter Scudamore and Richard Dunwoody who between them were the leading jumps jockeys of the 1980s and early 1990s. Richard Johnson, who has been second to McCoy in nearly all of his championships has the second most wins jockey of all time, and gained tabloid fame in the late 1990s for his relationship with Zara Philips.\nFormer champion jump jockeys Dick Francis and John Francome have become known to a wider public after enjoying second careers as writers of racing-based fiction, while Francome (until the end of 2012) and Mick Fitzgerald are known as horse racing TV pundits.\nAs of November 2017, there are around 450 professional jockeys licensed in the United Kingdom, along with around 300 amateur riders.\nTrainers.\nFormal training of racehorses began to be common in the reign of James I.\nThe two dominant forces in modern-day flat training in Britain in the modern era are Irish-based trainer Aidan O'Brien and Godolphin, through their trainers Saeed Bin Suroor and Charlie Appleby. They largely concentrate on Group races. Operating in much larger numbers of runners, but with a greater spread of quality, are trainers such as Mark Johnston, Richard Hannon Jr. and Richard Fahey.\nIn the jumps sphere, Nicky Henderson and Paul Nicholls dominate, along with the likes of David Pipe, Philip Hobbs, Jonjo O'Neill and Dan Skelton. In recent years, the Irish trainer Willie Mullins has enjoyed huge success in Britain, coming close to taking the Trainers Championship in 2015/16.\nOwners.\nAristocratic families have always owned horses in Britain, and the list of Classic winners features names such as the Earl of Grafton, Earl Grosvenor and Earl of Egremont from early days. In the modern era, Queen Elizabeth II retained a stable of horses trained by the likes of Michael Stoute. The Queen Mother was famously keen on horse racing, and a race at the Cheltenham Festival, the Queen Mother Champion Chase, is named in her honour. The current King and Queen continue to own horses, although a number of them were sold after the death of his mother, Queen Elizabeth II.\nThe two most prominent flat owners of the current era are Sheikh Mohammed, under the Godolphin banner and the team of Michael Tabor, John Magnier and others, based in Ireland.\nProminent jumps owners include JP McManus, Graham Wylie and Trevor Hemmings\nAdministrators.\nModern-day racing originated in Britain, so many figures from British racing have shaped the sport. Admiral Rous established the handicapping process for horse racing, including the weight-for-age scale, while in the 20th century, form expert and sometime administrator of the sport, Phil Bull established Timeform whose ratings are often used to assess the all-time great horses.\nKey data.\nKey data for 2004, 2005 and 2010 extracted from the British Horseracing Board's annual reports for https:// and https://, the https:// annual reportfrom its successor organisation, the British Horseracing Authority and the https:// British Horseracing Fact Book\nThe Chief Executive of the BHB stated in the 2005 annual report that \"Success was achieved in an environment of great uncertainty.\" The sport is adapting to the loss of income from pre-race data following court ruling prohibiting the practice of charging for such in 2004 and 2005, to which the BHB attributes the fall in prize money in 2005. The data charges were themselves designed to replace income lost when a statutory levy was abolished. In 2004 attendances exceeded 6 million for the first time since the 1950s (2004 annual report). The decrease in 2005 is attributable to the closure of Ascot Racecourse for redevelopment for the entire year.\nRacehorse welfare.\nA 2006 investigation by \"The Observer\" found that each year 6\u201310,000 horses are slaughtered for consumption abroad, a significant proportion of which are horses bred for racing.\u00a0\nThe industry produces approximately 5,000 foals, whilst 4\u20135,000 racehorses are retired each year, 90 being taken into care by the industries charity Retraining of Racehorses.\u00a0 Research conducted by the Equine Fertility Unit found that 66% of thoroughbred foals were never entered for a race, and more than 80% were no longer in training after four years.\u00a0 Foal production has increased threefold since 1966.\u00a0 Racehorses are capable of living for more than 30 years.\u00a0\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\nOrganisations\nMedia"}

At the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, she won a gold medal in the individual all-around competition, as well as two silver medals and two bronze medals.\nRetton's performance made her one of the most popular athletes in the United States. Her gold medal win was historic as Retton was the first American woman to win the all-around gold medal in Olympic gymnastics.\nEarly life.\nMary Lou Retton was born on January 24, 1968, in Fairmont, West Virginia. Her father, Ronnie, operated a coal-industry transportation equipment business. She attended Fairmont Senior High School, but did not graduate. She competed in the 1984 Olympic Games in Los Angeles, California, during her sophomore year of high school.\nGymnastics career.\nWhen Retton was eight years old she was inspired by watching Nadia Com\u0103neci outshine defending Olympic two-event winner Olga Korbut on television at the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal, and she took up gymnastics in her hometown of Fairmont, West Virginia. She was coached by Gary Rafaloski. Her parents then decided to move the family to Houston, Texas, to train under Romanians B\u00e9la and M\u00e1rta K\u00e1rolyi, who had coached Nadia Com\u0103neci before their defection to the United States. Under the K\u00e1rolyis, Retton soon began to make a name for herself in the U.S., winning the American Cup in 1983 and placing second to Dianne Durham (another K\u00e1rolyi student) at the US Nationals that same year. Though Retton missed the World Gymnastics Championships in 1983 due to a wrist injury, she won the American Classic in 1983 and 1984, as well as Japan's Chunichi Cup in 1983.\nAfter winning her second American Cup, the U.S. Nationals, and the U.S. Olympic Trials in 1984, Retton suffered a knee injury when she was performing a floor routine at a local gymnastics center at this time. She had sat down to sign autographs when she felt her knee lock, forcing her to undergo an operation five weeks prior to the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles. This was the first time the Summer Olympics had been held in the United States in 52 years.\nRetton recovered just in time for this most prestigious of tournaments, and in the competition, which was boycotted by the Soviet bloc nations except for Romania, Retton was engaged in a close battle with Ecaterina Szabo of Romania for the all-around gold medal. Trailing Szabo (after uneven bars and balance beam) by 0.15 with two events to go, Retton scored perfect 10s on floor exercise and vault\u2014the last event in an especially dramatic fashion, as there had been fears that her knee injury and the subsequent surgery might impair her performance. Retton won the all-around gold medal by 0.05 points, beating Szabo to become the first female gymnast from outside Eastern Europe to win the individual all-around gold. She also became the first American woman to be an Olympic all-around champion, which was an honor she held alone until the ongoing six-peat of American all-around champions \u2014 Carly Patterson in Athens 2004, Nastia Liukin in Beijing 2008, Gabby Douglas in London 2012, Simone Biles in Rio de Janeiro 2016 and Paris 2024, and Sunisa Lee in Tokyo 2021.\nAt the same Olympics, Retton won four additional medals: silver in the team competition and the horse vault, and bronze in the floor exercise and uneven bars. For her performance, she was named \"Sports Illustrated\" Magazine's \"Sportswoman of the Year.\" She appeared on a Wheaties box, and became the cereal's first official spokeswoman.\nIn 1985, Retton won the American Cup all-around competition for the third and final time. She retired in 1986.\nPost-gymnastics career.\nPolitical views.\nRetton was an outspoken supporter of the Reagan administration and appeared in a variety of television ads supporting Ronald Reagan as well as appearing at a rally for his reelection campaign just a month after the Olympics in her home state of West Virginia. Retton delivered the Pledge of Allegiance with fellow former gymnast and 1996 Olympic gold medalist Kerri Strug on the second night of the 2004 Republican National Convention.\nHonors.\nRetton's hometown, Fairmont, West Virginia, named a road and a park in the town after her. In 1985, she received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement presented by Awards Council member General Chuck Yeager.\nRetton was elected to the National Italian American Sports Hall of Fame in 1992. In 1993, the Associated Press released results of a sports study in which Retton was statistically tied for first place with fellow Olympian Dorothy Hamill as the most popular athlete in America. In 1997, Retton was inducted into the International Gymnastics Hall of Fame. In January 2020, Retton was the first woman inducted into the Houston Sports Hall of Fame.\nCompensated endorsements.\nDuring the 1990s, Retton worked as a spokeswoman, appearing in advertisements for the U.S. drugstore chain Revco.\nRetton has had many commercial endorsements, including bowling and shampoo. She was the first female athlete to be pictured on the front of a Wheaties box, and General Mills stated that Wheaties sales improved after her appearance. In 2019, Retton became a spokesperson for Australian Dream, a pain relief cream; and briefly, in 2023 as a spokesperson for Colonial Penn Life Insurance.\nSafe Sport Authorization Act of 2017.\nAfter the USA Gymnastics sex abuse scandal hit the news in 2016, the Protecting Young Victims from Sexual Abuse and Safe Sport Authorization Act of 2017 was introduced to the 115th Congress. Retton and other members of USA Gymnastics met with the bill sponsor, Senator Dianne Feinstein, with the aim of convincing her to drop the bill. Despite these efforts, on February 14, 2018, the act was signed into law and became effective immediately.\nPersonal life.\nRetton was born with hip dysplasia, a condition that was aggravated by her years as a competitive gymnast. After experiencing increased pain from the condition, she underwent multiple hip replacement surgeries.\nIn 1990, she married Shannon Kelley, a former University of Texas quarterback and Houston real estate developer who worked for the Houston Baptist University athletic department as of 2012. Together they have four daughters: Shayla (born 1995), McKenna (born 1997), Skyla (born 2000), and Emma (born 2002). McKenna was an NCAA gymnast at Louisiana State University, and Emma was an NCAA gymnast at the University of Arkansas. Retton lived in Houston, Texas until 2009, when her family moved to her native West Virginia. They lived there for two years while her husband was a football coach at Fairmont State University. She moved back to Houston in 2012. Retton and Kelley were divorced in February 2018.\nOn October 10, 2023, Retton's daughter McKenna announced that her mother was critically ill with pneumonia. Retton reportedly did not have health insurance and turned to crowdfunding to raise money for medical expenses. Retton returned home to recover later that month and issued a statement on October 30, 2023, saying \"I'm with family continuing to slowly recover and staying very positive as I know this recovery is a long and slow process. When the time is right, I will be sharing more information about my health issues.\" The total sum collected as of January 22, 2024, was $459,234. Upon inquiry from \"USA Today\", Retton would not comment on any details surrounding her medical issue nor how much of the donations were allocated toward her healthcare. Her daughter said any \"remaining funds\" would go towards a charity, but failed to provide any details or timeline.\nOn May 17, 2025, she was arrested in Marion County, West Virginia for DUI. In July 2025 she pleaded no contest to a non-aggravated DUI charge. She was fined $100.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "74729", "revid": "31831", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=74729", "title": "Chymotrypsinogen", "text": "Inactive precursor of digestive enzyme chymotrypsin\nChymotrypsinogen is an inactive precursor (zymogen) of chymotrypsin, a digestive enzyme which breaks proteins down into smaller peptides. Chymotrypsinogen is a single polypeptide chain consisting of 245 amino acid residues. It is synthesized in the acinar cells of the pancreas and stored inside membrane-bounded granules at the apex of the acinar cell. Release of the granules from the cell is stimulated by either a hormonal signal or a nerve impulse, and the granules spill into a duct leading into the duodenum.\nActivation.\nChymotrypsinogen must be inactive until it gets to the digestive tract, in order to prevent damage to the pancreas or any other organs. It is activated by another enzyme called trypsin. The active form is called \u03c0-chymotrypsin and is used to create \u03b1-chymotrypsin. Trypsin cleaves the peptide bond in chymotrypsinogen between arginine-15 and isoleucine-16. This creates two peptides within the \u03c0-chymotrypsin molecule, held together by a disulfide bond. One \u03c0-chymotrypsin acts on another by breaking a leucine and serine peptide bond. The activated \u03c0-chymotrypsin reacts with other \u03c0-chymotrypsin molecules to cleave and remove two dipeptides: serine-14\u2013arginine-15 and threonine-147\u2013asparagine-148. This reaction produces \u03b1-chymotrypsin. The yield of \u03b1-chymotrypsin can be affected by inhibitors such as hydrocinnate and also by pH, temperature and calcium chloride.\nThe activation process can be studied using fluorescence probe 2-p-toluidinylnaphthalene-6-sulfonate (TNS). TNS forms covalent bonds with chymotrypsinogen and as the bonds break to form chymotrypsin in the presence of trypsin, the fluorescence increases.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "74730", "revid": "44242786", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=74730", "title": "Grand National", "text": "English steeplechase horse race at Aintree Racecourse\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Jockey colours header/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThe Grand National is a National Hunt horse race held annually at Aintree Racecourse in Aintree, Merseyside, England. First run in 1839, it is a handicap steeplechase over an official distance of about , with horses jumping 30 fences over two laps. It is the most valuable jump race in Europe, with a prize fund of \u00a31 million in 2017. An event that is prominent in British culture, the race is popular amongst many people who do not normally watch or bet on horse racing at other times of the year.\nThe course over which the race is run features much larger fences than those found on conventional National Hunt tracks. Many of these fences, particularly Becher's Brook, The Chair and the Canal Turn, have become famous in their own right and, combined with the distance of the event, create what has been called \"the ultimate test of horse and rider\".\nThe Grand National has been broadcast live on free-to-air terrestrial television in the United Kingdom since 1960. From then, until 2012, it was broadcast by the BBC. Channel 4 broadcast the event between 2013 and 2016: UK broadcasting rights were transferred to ITV from 2017. An estimated 500 to 600 million people watch the Grand National in over 140 countries. The race has also been broadcast on radio since 1927; BBC Radio held exclusive rights until 2013. Talksport acquired radio commentary rights in 2014: Both the BBC and Talksport currently broadcast the race in full.\nThe Grand National had suffered three major disruptions in post-war history. The 1993 Grand National was not held due to a series of false starts, the postponement of the 1997 Grand National to a Monday because of an IRA bomb threat and the 2023 Grand National being delayed due to Animal Rising protesters. \nThe most recent running of the race, in 2025, was won by Patrick Mullins riding Nick Rockett. Since 2017, the race and accompanying festival have been sponsored by Randox.\nHistory.\nFounding and early Nationals (1829\u20131850).\nThe Grand National was founded by William Lynn, a syndicate head and proprietor of the Waterloo Hotel, on land he leased in Aintree from William Molyneux, 2nd Earl of Sefton. Lynn set out a course, built a grandstand, and Lord Sefton laid the foundation stone on 7 February 1829. There is much debate regarding the first official Grand National; most leading published historians, including John Pinfold, now prefer the idea that the first running was in 1836 and was won by The Duke. This same horse won again in 1837, while Sir William was the winner in 1838. These races have long been disregarded because of the belief that they took place at Maghull and not Aintree. However, some historians have unearthed evidence in recent years that suggests those three races were run over the same course at Aintree and were regarded as having been Grand Nationals up until the mid-1860s. Contemporary newspaper reports place all the 1836\u201338 races at Aintree, although the 1839 race is the first described as \"national\". However, attempts to restore The Nationals of 1836\u20131838 in the record books have been unsuccessful. \nIn 1838 and 1839 three significant events occurred to transform the race from a small local affair to a national event. Firstly, the Great St. Albans Chase, which had clashed with the steeplechase at Aintree, was not renewed after 1838, leaving a major hole in the chasing calendar. Secondly, the railway, opened from Manchester to Liverpool in 1830, was linked to a line from London and Birmingham in 1839 enabling rail transport to the Liverpool area from large parts of the country for the first time. Finally, a committee was formed to better organise the event. These factors led to a more highly publicised race in 1839 which attracted a larger field of top quality horses and riders, greater press coverage, and increased attendance on race day. Over time the first three runnings of the event were quickly forgotten to secure the 1839 race its place in history as the first official Grand National. \nThe 1839 race was won by rider Jem Mason on the aptly named, Lottery. The Duke was ridden by Martin Becher. The fence Becher's Brook is named after him and is where he fell in the race.\nBy the 1840s, Lynn's ill-health blunted his enthusiasm for Aintree. Edward Topham, a respected handicapper and prominent member of Lynn's syndicate, began to exert greater influence over the National. He turned the chase into a handicap in 1843 after it had been a weight-for-age race for the first four years, and took over the land lease in 1848. One century later, the Topham family bought the course outright.\nLater in the century, the race was the setting of a thriller by the popular novelist Henry Hawley Smart.\nWar National Steeplechase (1916\u20131918).\nFor three years during the First World War, while Aintree Racecourse was taken over by the War Office, an alternative race was run at Gatwick Racecourse, a now disused course on land now occupied by Gatwick Airport. The first of these races, in 1916, was called the Racecourse Association Steeplechase, and in 1917 and 1918 the race was called the War National Steeplechase. The races at Gatwick are not always recognised as \"Grand Nationals\" and their results are often omitted from winners' lists.\nTipperary Tim (1928).\nOn the day of the 1928 Grand National, before the race had begun, Tipperary Tim's jockey William Dutton heard a friend call out to him: \"Billy boy, you'll only win if all the others fall down!\" These words turned out to be true, as 41 of the 42 starters fell during the race. That year's National was run during misty weather conditions with the going very heavy. As the field approached the Canal Turn on the first circuit, Easter Hero fell, causing a pile-up from which only seven horses emerged with seated jockeys. By the penultimate fence, this number had reduced to three, with Great Span looking most likely to win ahead of Billy Barton and Tipperary Tim. Great Span's saddle then slipped, leaving Billy Barton in the lead until he too then fell. Although Billy Barton's jockey Tommy Cullinan managed to remount and complete the race, it was Tipperary Tim who came in first at outside odds of 100/1. With only two riders completing the course, this remains a record for the lowest number of finishers.\nSecond World War and the 1950s.\nAlthough the Grand National was run as normal in 1940 and most other major horse races around the world were able to be held throughout the war, the commandeering of Aintree Racecourse for defence use in 1941 meant no Grand National could be held from 1941 to 1945. It recommenced in 1946, when it was run on a Friday, and from 1947 was moved to a Saturday, at the urging of the Home Secretary James Chuter Ede, who thought this would make it more accessible to working people. It has normally been run on a Saturday ever since.\nDuring the 1950s the Grand National was dominated by Vincent O'Brien, who trained different winners of the race for three consecutive years between 1953 and 1955. Early Mist secured O'Brien's first victory in 1953; Royal Tan won in 1954, and Quare Times completed the Irish trainer's hat-trick in 1955.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nOh, that's racing!\n The Queen Mother on Devon Loch's collapse moments from certain victory\nThe running of the 1956 Grand National witnessed one of the chase's most bizarre incidents. Devon Loch, owned by Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother, had cleared the final fence in the leading position, five lengths clear of E.S.B. from what seemed like certain victory, Devon Loch suddenly, and inexplicably, half-jumped into the air and collapsed in a belly-flop on the turf. Despite efforts by jockey Dick Francis, Devon Loch was unable to complete the race, leaving E.S.B. to cross the finishing line first. Responding to the commiserations of E.S.B.\u2019s owner, the Queen Mother famously commented: \"Oh, that's racing!\"\nHad Devon Loch completed the race he might have set a new record for the fastest finishing time, which E.S.B. missed by only four-fifths of a second. Many explanations have been offered for Devon Loch's behaviour on the run-in, but the incident remains inexplicable. The incident became part of the folklore of the event, and by extension British sporting culture. In modern language, the phrase \"to do a Devon Loch\" is often used to describe a last-minute failure to achieve an expected victory.\nFoinavon (1967).\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nRutherfords has been hampered, and so has Castle Falls; Rondetto has fallen, Princeful has fallen, Norther has fallen, Kirtle Lad has fallen, The Fossa has fallen, there's a right pile-up... And now, with all this mayhem, Foinavon has gone off on his own! He's about in front of everything else!\n Commentator Michael O'Hehir describes the chaotic scene at the 23rd fence in 1967\nIn the 1967 Grand National, most of the field were hampered or dismounted in a m\u00eal\u00e9e at the 23rd fence, allowing a rank-outsider, Foinavon, to become a surprise winner at odds of 100/1. A loose horse named Popham Down, who had unseated his rider at the first jump, suddenly veered across the leading group at the 23rd, causing them to either stop, refuse or unseat their riders. Racing journalist Lord Oaksey described the resulting pile-up by saying that Popham Down had \"cut down the leaders like a row of thistles\". Some horses even started running in the wrong direction, back the way they had come. Foinavon, whose owner had such little faith in him that he had travelled to Worcester that day instead, had been lagging some behind the leading pack, giving his jockey, John Buckingham, time to steer his mount wide of the havoc and make a clean jump of the fence on the outside. Although 17 jockeys remounted and some made up considerable ground, particularly Josh Gifford on 15/2 favourite Honey End, none had time to catch Foinavon before he crossed the finishing line. The 7th/23rd fence was officially named the 'Foinavon fence' in 1984.\n1970s and Red Rum.\nThe 1970s were mixed years for the Grand National. In 1973, eight years after Mrs. Mirabel Topham announced she was seeking a buyer, the racecourse was finally sold to property developer Bill Davies. Davies tripled the admission prices, and consequently, the attendance at the 1975 race, won by L'Escargot, was the smallest in living memory. It was after this that bookmaker Ladbrokes made an offer, signing an agreement with Davies allowing them to manage the Grand National.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThey're willing him home now! The 12-year-old Red Rum, being preceded only by loose horses, being chased by Churchtown Boy... They're coming to the elbow, just a furlong now between Red Rum and his third Grand National triumph! It's hats off and a tremendous reception, you've never heard one like it at Liverpool... Red Rum wins the National!\n Commentator Peter O'Sullevan describes Red Rum's record third Grand National win in 1977\nDuring this period, Red Rum was breaking all records to become the most successful racehorse in Grand National history. Originally bought as a yearling in 1966 for 400 guineas (\u00a3420), he passed through various training yards before being bought for 6,000 guineas (\u00a36,300) by Ginger McCain on behalf of Noel le Mare. Two days after the purchase while trotting the horse on Southport beach, McCain noticed that Red Rum appeared lame. The horse was suffering from pedal osteitis, an inflammatory bone disorder. McCain had witnessed many lame carthorses reconditioned by being galloped in sea-water. He successfully used this treatment on his newly acquired racehorse.\nRed Rum became, and remains as of 2025, the only horse to have won the Grand National three times, in 1973, 1974, and 1977. He also finished second in the two intervening years, 1975 and 1976.\nIn 1973, he was in second place at the last fence, 15 lengths behind champion horse Crisp, who was carrying . Red Rum made up the ground on the run-in and, two strides from the finishing post, he pipped the tiring Crisp to win by three-quarters of a length in what is arguably the most memorable Grand National of all time. Red Rum finished in 9 minutes 1.9 seconds, taking 18.3 seconds off the previous record for the National which had been set in 1935 by Reynoldstown. His record was to stand for the next seventeen years.\nBob Champion's National (1981).\nTwo years before the 1981 Grand National, jockey Bob Champion had been diagnosed with testicular cancer and given only months to live by doctors. But by 1981 he had recovered and was passed fit to ride in the Grand National. He rode Aldaniti, a horse deprived in its youth and which had only recently recovered from chronic leg problems. Despite a poor start, the pair went on to win &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;4+1\u20442 lengths ahead of the much-fancied Spartan Missile, ridden by amateur jockey and 54-year-old grandfather John Thorne. Champion and Aldaniti were instantly propelled to celebrity status, and within two years, their story had been re-created in the film \"Champions\", starring John Hurt.\nSeagram's sponsorship (1984\u20131991).\nFrom 1984 to 1991, Seagram sponsored the Grand National. The Canadian distiller provided a solid foundation on which the race's revival could be built, firstly enabling the course to be bought from Davies and to be run and managed by the Jockey Club. It is said that Ivan Straker, Seagram's UK chairman, became interested in the potential opportunity after reading a passionate newspaper article written by journalist Lord Oaksey, who, in his riding days, had come within three-quarters of a length of winning the 1963 National. The last Seagram-sponsored Grand National was in 1991. Coincidentally, the race was won by a horse named Seagram. Martell, then a Seagram subsidiary, took over sponsorship of the Aintree meeting for an initial seven years from 1992, in a \u00a34 million deal.\nThe race that never was (1993).\nThe result of the 1993 Grand National was declared void after a series of incidents commentator Peter O'Sullevan later called \"the greatest disaster in the history of the Grand National.\"\nWhile under starter's orders, one jockey was tangled in the starting tape which had failed to rise correctly. A false start was declared, but due to a lack of communication between course officials, 30 of the 39 jockeys did not realise this and began the race.\nCourse officials tried to stop the runners by waving red flags, but many jockeys continued to race, believing that they were protesters (a group of whom had invaded the course earlier), while Peter Scudamore only stopped because he saw his trainer, Martin Pipe, waving frantically at him.\nSeven horses completed the course, meaning the result was void. The first past the post was Esha Ness (in the second-fastest time ever), ridden by John White, trained by Jenny Pitman and owned by Patrick Bancroft.\nThe Monday National (1997).\nThe 1997 Grand National was postponed after two coded bomb threats were received from the Provisional Irish Republican Army. The course was secured by police who then evacuated jockeys, race personnel, and local residents along with 60,000 spectators. Cars and coaches were locked in the course grounds, leaving some 20,000 people without their vehicles over the weekend. With limited accommodation available in the city, local residents opened their doors and took in many of those stranded. This prompted tabloid headlines such as \"We'll fight them on the Becher's\", in reference to Winston Churchill's war-time speech. The race was run 48 hours later on the Monday, with the meeting organisers offering 20,000 tickets with free admission.\nRecent history (2004\u2013present).\nRed Rum's trainer Ginger McCain returned to the Grand National in 2004, 31 years after Red Rum's epic run-in defeat of Crisp to secure his first of three wins. McCain's Amberleigh House came home first, ridden by Graham Lee, overtaking Clan Royal on the final straight. Hedgehunter, who would go on to win in 2005, fell at the last while leading. McCain had equalled George Dockeray and Fred Rimell's record feat of training four Grand National winners.\nIn 2005 John Smith's took over from Martell as main sponsors of the Grand National and many of the other races at the three-day Aintree meeting for the first time. In 2006 John Smith's launched the John Smith's People's Race which gave ten members of the public the chance to ride in a flat race at Aintree on Grand National day. In total, thirty members of the public took part in the event before it was discontinued in 2010.\nIn 2009, Mon Mome became the longest-priced winner of the National for 42 years when he defied outside odds of 100/1 to win by 12 lengths. The victory was also the first for trainer Venetia Williams, the first female trainer to triumph since Jenny Pitman in 1995. The race was also the first National ride for Liam Treadwell.\nIn 2010 the National became the first horse race to be televised in high-definition in the UK.\nIn August 2013 Crabbie's was announced as the new sponsor of the Grand National. The three-year deal between the alcoholic ginger beer producer and Aintree saw the race run for a record purse of \u00a31 million in 2014.\nIn March 2016 it was announced that Randox Health would take over from Crabbie's as official partners of the Grand National festival from 2017, for at least five years.\n The sponsorship award was controversial as Aintree's chairwoman, Rose Paterson, was married to Owen Paterson, a Member of Parliament (MP) who also earns a \u00a350,000 annual fee as a consultant for Randox.\nThe 2020 race was not run owing to the coronavirus pandemic; in its place, a virtual race was produced using CGI technology and based on algorithms of the 40 horses most likely to have competed. The virtual race was won by Potters Corner, winner of the 2019 Welsh Grand National. (Another computer-generated virtual race was made also, whose runners were many horses who had won the Grand National in past years, each shown with its performance as at its racing prime. Its winner was Red Rum by less than a length, having just passed Manifesto.)\nIn December 2020 Randox Health announced they had extended their sponsorship for a further 5 years which will make them sponsors to 2026.\nIn 2021, Rachael Blackmore became the first female jockey to win the race, on the horse Minella Times.\nIn 2023, the race was disrupted by the Animal Rising protests, the first such disruptions since the cancellation of the 1993 Grand National due to a series of false starts and the 1997 Grand National due to the IRA bomb threat.\nThe course.\nThe Grand National is run over the National Course at Aintree and consists of two laps of 16 fences, the first 14 of which are jumped twice. Horses completing the race cover a distance of , the longest of any National Hunt race in Britain. As part of a review of safety following the 2012 running of the event, from 2013 to 2015 the start was moved forward away from the crowds and grandstands, reducing the race distance by from the historical . The course has one of the longest run-ins from the final fence of any steeplechase, at .\nThe Grand National was designed as a cross-country steeplechase when it was first officially run in 1839. The runners started at a lane on the edge of the racecourse and raced away from the course out over open countryside towards the Leeds and Liverpool Canal. The gates, hedges, and ditches that they met along the way were flagged to provide them with the obstacles to be jumped along the way with posts and rails erected at the two points where the runners jumped a brook. The runners returned towards the racecourse by running along the edge of the canal before re-entering the course at the opposite end. The runners then ran the length of the racecourse before embarking on a second circuit before finishing in front of the stands. The majority of the race, therefore, took place not on the actual Aintree Racecourse but instead in the adjoining countryside. That countryside was incorporated into the modern course but commentators still often refer to it as \"the country\".\nFences.\nThere are 16 fences on the National Course topped with spruce from the Lake District. The cores of 12 fences were rebuilt in 2012 and they are now made of a flexible plastic material which is more forgiving than the traditional wooden core fences. They are still topped with at least of spruce for the horses to knock off. Some of the jumps carry names from the history of the race. All 16 are jumped on the first lap, but on the final lap, the runners bear to the right onto the run-in for home, avoiding The Chair and the Water Jump. The following is a summary of all 16 fences on the course:\nHeight: \nOften met at great speed, which can lead to several falls, the highest being 12 runners in 1951. The drop on the landing side was reduced after the 2011 Grand National. It was bypassed in both 2019 and 2023 on the final lap, after equine casualties. The fence was moved nearer to the start from the 2024 race, to try to reduce the speed of the field early in the race.\nHeight: \nBefore 1888 the first two fences were located approximately halfway between the first to second and second to third jumps. The second became known as The Fan, after a mare who refused the obstacle three years in succession. The name fell out of favour with the relocation of the fences.\nHeight: ; fronted by a ditch\nThe first big test in the race as horses are still adapting to the obstacles. In 2022, the race was shortened to 29 fences by bypassing this fence following a fatality.\nHeight: \nA testing obstacle that often leads to falls and unseated riders. In 2011 the 20th became the first fence in Grand National history to be bypassed on the final lap, following an equine fatality.\nHeight: \nA plain obstacle which precedes the most famous fence on the course. It was bypassed on the final lap for the first time in 2012 so that medics could treat a jockey who fell from his mount on the first lap and had broken a leg.\nHeight: , with the landing side to lower than the takeoff side\nThe drop at this fence often catches runners by surprise. Becher's has always been a popular vantage point as it can present one of the most spectacular displays of jumping when the horse and rider meet the fence right. Jockeys must sit back in their saddles and use their body weight as ballast to counter the steep drop. It takes its name from Captain Martin Becher who fell there in the first Grand National and took shelter in the small brook running along the landing side of the fence while the remainder of the field thundered over. It is said that Becher later reflected: \"Water tastes disgusting without the benefits of whisky.\" It was bypassed in 2011 along with fence 20, after an equine casualty, and again in 2018 after a jockey was attended by doctors, both occurring on the final lap.\nHeight: \nOne of the smallest on the course, it was named in 1984 after the 1967 winner who avoided a m\u00eal\u00e9e at the fence to go on and win the race at outside odds of 100/1.\nHeight: \nNoted for its sharp 90-degree left turn immediately after landing. Before the First World War it was not uncommon for loose horses to continue straight ahead after the jump and end up in the Leeds and Liverpool Canal itself. There was once a ditch before the fence but this was filled in after a m\u00eal\u00e9e in the 1928 race. It was bypassed for the first time in 2015 on the final lap as vets arrived to treat a horse who fell on the first lap.\nHeight: with a brook\nThe fence was originally known as the Second Brook but was renamed after a horse named Valentine was reputed to have jumped the fence hind legs first in 1840. A grandstand was erected alongside the fence in the early part of the 20th century but fell into decline after the Second World War and was torn down in the 1970s.\nHeight: \nA plain obstacle that leads the runners alongside the canal towards two ditches.\nHeight: , with a ditch on the takeoff side. This fence was 5 feet hight but was lowered by 2 inches from 2024.\nHeight: , with a ditch on the landing side\nThe runners then cross the Melling Road near to the Anchor Bridge, a popular vantage point since the earliest days of the race. This also marks the point where the runners are said to be re-entering the \"racecourse proper\". In the early days of the race, it is thought there was an obstacle near this point known as the Table Jump, which may have resembled a bank similar to those still seen at Punchestown in Ireland. In the 1840s the Melling Road was also flanked by hedges and the runners had to jump into the road and then back out of it.\nHeight: \nA plain obstacle that comes at a point when the runners are usually in a good rhythm and thus rarely causes problems.\nHeight: \nThe last fence on the final lap and which has often seen very tired horses fall. Despite some tired runners falling on the 30th and appearing injured, no horse deaths have occurred at the 30th fence to date.\nOn the first lap of the race, runners continue around the course to negotiate two fences which are only jumped once:\nHeight: , preceded by a 6\u00a0ft (1.83 m) wide ditch\nThis fence is the site of the accident that claimed the only human life in the National's history: in 1862, Joe Wynne fell here and died from his injuries, although a coroner's inquest revealed that the rider was in a gravely weakened condition through consumption. This brought about the ditch on the take-off side of the fence in an effort to slow the horses on approach. The fence was the location where a distance judge sat in the earliest days of the race. On the second circuit, he would record the finishing order from his position and declare any horse that had not passed him before the previous runner passed the finishing post as \"distanced\", meaning a non-finisher. The practice was done away with in the 1850s, but the monument where the chair stood is still there. The ground on the landing side is six inches higher than on the takeoff side, creating the opposite effect to the drop at Becher's. The fence was originally known as the Monument Jump, but \"The Chair\" came into more frequent use in the 1930s. Today it is one of the most popular jumps on the course for spectators.\nHeight: \nOriginally a stone wall in the very early Nationals. The Water Jump was one of the most popular jumps on the course, presenting a great jumping spectacle for those in the stands and was always a major feature in the newsreels' coverage of the race. As the newsreels made way for television in the 1960s, so, in turn, did the Water Jump fall under the shadow of its neighbour, The Chair, in popularity as an obstacle.\nOn the final lap, after the 30th fence, the remaining runners bear right, avoiding The Chair and Water Jump, to head onto a \"run-in\" to the finishing post. The run-in is not perfectly straight: an \"elbow\" requires jockeys to make a slight right before finding themselves truly on the home straight. It is on this run-in\u2014one of the longest in the United Kingdom at \u2014that many potential winners have had victory snatched away, such as Devon Loch in 1956, Crisp in 1973, What's Up Boys in 2002 and Sunnyhillboy in 2012.\nRecords.\nLeading horse:\nLeading jockey:\nLeading trainers:\nLeading owners:\nWinners.\nThe following table lists the winners of the last ten Grand Nationals:\nJockeys.\nWhen the concept of the Grand National was first envisaged it was designed as a race for gentlemen riders, meaning men who were not paid to compete, and while this was written into the conditions of the early races many of the riders who weighed out for the 1839 race were professionals for hire. Throughout the Victorian era the line between the amateur and professional sportsman existed only in terms of the rider's status, and the engagement of an amateur to ride in the race was rarely considered a handicap to a contender's chances of winning. Many gentleman riders won the race before the First World War.\nAlthough the number of amateurs remained high between the wars their ability to match their professional counterparts gradually receded. After the Second World War, it became rare for any more than four or five amateurs to take part in any given year. The last amateur rider to win the Grand National was Mr Patrick Mullins in 2025 aboard Nick Rockett. The penultimate amateur to win the race was Sam Waley-Cohen in 2022 when riding Noble Yeats. By the 21st century, however, openings for amateur riders had become very rare with some years passing with no amateur riders at all taking part. Those that do in the modern era are most usually talented young riders who are often close to turning professional. In the past, such amateur riders would have been joined by army officers, such as David Campbell who won in 1896, and sporting aristocrats, farmers or local huntsmen and point to point riders, who usually opted to ride their own mounts. But all these genres of rider have faded out in the last quarter of a century with no riders of military rank or aristocratic title having taken a mount since 1982.\nThe Sex Discrimination Act 1975 made it possible for female jockeys to enter the race. The first female jockey to enter the race was Charlotte Brew on the 200/1 outsider Barony Fort in the 1977 race. The first female jockey to complete the race was Geraldine Rees on Cheers in 1982. The 21st century has not seen a significant increase in female riders but it has seen them gain rides on mounts considered to have a genuine chance of winning. In 2005, Carrie Ford finished fifth on the 8/1 second-favourite Forest Gunner. In 2012, Katie Walsh achieved what was at the time the best result yet for a female jockey, finishing third on the 8/1 joint-favourite Seabass. In 2015, Nina Carberry became the first female jockey to take a fifth ride in the Grand National, her best placing being seventh in 2010. Rachael Blackmore became the first female jockey to win the Grand National aboard Minella Times in 2021.\nProfessionals now hold dominance in the Grand National and better training, dietary habits and protective clothing have ensured that riders' careers last much longer and offer more opportunities to ride in the race. Of the 37 riders who have enjoyed 13 or more rides in the race, 19 had their first ride in the 20th century and 11 had careers that continued into or started in the 21st century. Despite that, a long-standing record of 19 rides in the race was set by Tom Olliver back in 1859 and was not equalled until 2014 by A. P. McCoy. This has since been topped by Richard Johnson. Longevity is no guarantee of success, however, as 13 of the 34 never tasted the glory of winning the race. McCoy is the only rider to successfully remove himself from the list after winning at the 15th attempt in 2010. Richard Johnson set a new record of 21 failed attempts to win the race from 1997 to 2019, having finished second twice. The other 16 riders who never won or have not as yet won, having had more than 12 rides in the race are:\nPeter Scudamore technically lined up for thirteen Grand Nationals without winning but the last of those was the void race of 1993, which meant that he officially competed in twelve Nationals.\nMany other well-known jockeys have failed to win the Grand National. These include champion jockeys such as Terry Biddlecombe, John Francome, Josh Gifford, Stan Mellor, Jonjo O'Neill (who never finished the race) and Fred Rimell. Three jockeys who led over the last fence in the National but lost the race on the run-in ended up as television commentators: Lord Oaksey (on Carrickbeg in 1963), Norman Williamson (on Mely Moss in 2000), and Richard Pitman (on Crisp in 1973). Dick Francis also never won the Grand National in 8 attempts although he did lead over the last fence on Devon Loch in the 1956 race, only for the horse to collapse under him when well in front only from the winning post. Pitman's son Mark also led over the last fence, only to be pipped at the post when riding Garrison Savannah in 1991. David Dick won the 1956 Grand National on E.S.B. when Devon Loch collapsed. He also holds the record for the number of clear rounds \u2013 nine times, though this has been surpassed by Ruby Walsh (11). Since 1986, any jockey making five or more clear rounds has been awarded the Aintree Clear Rounds Award.\nHorse welfare.\nStatistics.\nThe Grand National has been described by the BBC as higher risk than lots of other horse races. According to the British Horseracing Authority, as of 2022, the five-year average fatality rate for jump racing was 0.43%. However, the rate for the Grand National over the last ten runnings was more than twice as high, at 1.12%.\nHistory of fatalities.\nDuring the 1970s and 1980s, the Grand National saw a total of 12 horses die (half of which were at Becher's Brook); in the next 20-year period from 1990 to 2010, when modifications to the course were most significant, there were 17 equine fatalities. The 2011 and 2012 races each yielded two deaths, including one each at Becher's Brook. In 2013, when further changes were made to introduce a more flexible fence structure, there were no fatalities in the race itself although two horses died in run-up races over the same course. The animal welfare charity League Against Cruel Sports counts the number of horse deaths over the three-day meeting from the year 2000 to 2013 at 40. \nThere were no equine fatalities in the main Grand National race for seven years until 2019, when one horse died at the first fence. In 2021, one horse was euthanised after the race after suffering an injury on a flat section between fences. Two more were euthanised after suffering injuries in the 2022 event. One of the incidents came at fence 3, the other on the gallop between fences 12 and 13. There was one fatality in 2023, following a fall at the first fence, and two other horses taken away by ambulance.\n The involvement of animal rights protesters was questioned after the race. Sandy Thompson, trainer of the fatally injured Hill Sixteen, claimed along with several other racing personalities that the protesters had (directly or indirectly) caused the death of the gelding and were equally responsible for the number of fallers, because the delay they caused to the start, after storming the course close to post time, got the horses worked up and \"hyper\". The protesters have denied these comments, saying they had every right to break and enter and trespass onto racecourse ground and stage a protest despite officials' orders not to.\nIn April 2025, animal rights organisations criticised the Grand National after a horse that was leading the race suffered a grim fall, and a second collapsed shortly after the competition.\nOrganiser changes.\nOver the years, Aintree officials have worked in conjunction with animal welfare organisations to reduce the severity of some fences and to improve veterinary facilities. In 2008, a new veterinary surgery was constructed in the stable yard which has two large treatment boxes, an X-ray unit, video endoscopy, equine solarium, and sandpit facilities. Further changes in set-up and procedure allow vets to treat horses more rapidly and in better surroundings. Those requiring more specialist care can be transported by specialist horse ambulances, under police escort, to the nearby Philip Leverhulme Equine Hospital at the University of Liverpool at Leahurst. A mobile on-course X-ray machine assists in the prompt diagnosis of leg injuries when horses are pulled up, and oxygen and water are available by the final fence and finishing post. Five vets remain mobile on the course during the running of the race and can initiate treatment of injured fallers at the fence. Additional vets are stationed at the pull-up area, finishing post, and in the surgery.\nSome of the National's most challenging fences have also been modified, while still preserving them as formidable obstacles. After the 1989 Grand National, in which two horses died in incidents at Becher's Brook, Aintree began the most significant of its modifications to the course. The brook on the landing side of Becher's was filled in and, after the 2011 race which also saw an equine fatality at the obstacle, the incline on the landing side was levelled out and the drop on was reduced by between 4 and 5 inches (10\u201313\u00a0cm) to slow the runners. Other fences have also been reduced in height over the years, and the entry requirements for the race have been made stricter. Screening at the Canal Turn now prevents horses from being able to see the sharp left turn and encourages jockeys to spread out along the fence, rather than take the tight left-side route. Additionally, work has been carried out to smooth the core post infrastructure of the fences with protective padding to reduce impact upon contact, and the height of the toe-boards on all fences has been increased to . These orange-coloured boards are positioned at the base of each fence and provide a clear ground line to assist horses in determining the base of the fence.\nParts of the course were widened in 2009 to allow runners to bypass fences if required. This was utilised for the first time during the 2011 race as casualties at fences 4 and 6 (Becher's Brook) resulted in marshals diverting the remaining contenders around those fences on the final lap.\nSome within the horseracing community, including those with notable achievements in the Grand National such as Ginger McCain and Bob Champion, have argued that the lowering of fences and the narrowing of ditches, primarily designed to increase horse safety, has made matters worse by encouraging the runners to race faster. \nAfter the 2023 race, the Jockey Club announced several major changes to the event for 2024, recognising \"the need for more substantial updates on several key areas in order to better protect the welfare of racehorses and jockeys\". This included a reduction in the size of the field for the first time, from 40 to 34 (long called for by welfare campaigners such as the RSPCA), as well as infrastructure changes such as moving fences to slow the speed of the race at the start, and further development of pre-race veterinary protocols.\nGrand National Legends.\nIn 2009, the race sponsors John Smith's launched a poll to determine five personalities to be inducted into the inaugural \"Grand National Legends\" initiative. The winners were announced on the day of the 2010 Grand National and inscribed on commemorative plaques at Aintree. They were:\nA panel of experts also selected three additional legends:\nIn 2011, nine additional legends were added:\nJohn Smith's also added five \"people's legends\" who were introduced on Liverpool Day, the first day of the Grand National meeting. The five were:\nA public vote announced at the 2012 Grand National saw five more additions to the Legends hall:\nThe selection panel also inducted three more competitors:\nSponsorship.\nSince 1984 it has been sponsored by 5 different companies.\nPopular culture.\nThe race features in the 2010 Jilly Cooper novel \"Jump!,\" where female jockey Amber Lloyd-Foxe rides the winning horse, Mrs Wilkinson, to victory.\nNotes.\nFavourites.\nIn the 71 races of the post-war era (excluding the void race in 1993), the favourite or joint-favourite have only won the race twelve times (in 1950, 1960, 1973, 1982, 1996, 1998, 2005, 2008, 2010, 2019, 2023, and 2024) and have failed to complete the course in 37 Nationals.\nMares.\nSince its inception, 13 mares have won the race, most recently in 1951:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nGreys.\nThree greys have won:\nFemale jockeys.\nSince 1977, women have ridden in 24 Grand Nationals.

On 1 January 2017 Veghel, together with Schijndel and Sint-Oedenrode, merged into a new municipality called Meierijstad. This created the largest municipality of the province of North Brabant in terms of land area.\nHistory.\nThe first known settlements date to Roman times and were established near the River Aa. The oldest written record of Veghel dates from 1225. It is a document of the Abbey of Berne, written in Latin on a piece of parchment, and describes several properties owned by the abbey. Among those is an estate located in the settlement of \"Vehchele\".\nIn 1310, John II of Brabant granted the inhabitants the right to use common grounds. For some decades in the 16th and 17th century, the municipality was ruled by the Lords Van Erp; they resided at their castle of Frisselsteijn in Veghel.\nIn 1648 Veghel became part of the Republic of the Seven United Netherlands. As a former part of the Duchy of Brabant, Veghel is situated in the Meierij of 's-Hertogenbosch. \nLike all the other areas of Brabant and Limburg which were transferred to the Netherlands by the Peace of Westphalia), Veghel was a Catholic town. It suffered economic and religious oppression from the Protestant Dutch and was part of the military buffer zone of the Dutch Republic.\nIn 1719 Veghel became a market town, when it was granted market rights by the States General of the Netherlands. This gave it the privilege of holding weekly markets and four annual fairs. However, it was not until the French wars of 1795 that Veghel formally received freedom of religion again and received a guarantee of full common rights from the Dutch government. \nIn 1810 Veghel became part of the Kingdom of the Netherlands. From the middle of the 19th century, the agrarian market town began to industrialize as a consequence of the opening of the South Willem's Canal. The wealth generated by new industries helped support the construction of large-scale buildings, such as the neogothic church by Pierre Cuypers and the neoclassical town hall, dates from that period. Monastic orders developed Veghel as a regional centre of health care and education, which it remains to this day.\nIn 1940 Veghel was occupied by German troops. With the beginning of Operation Market Garden in 1944, Veghel was one of the dropping-sites for Allied paratroops owing to its strategic location.\nThe period since the 1950s has seen much growth, with the development of new industries. Also several international companies (e.g. Mars, Incorporated, FrieslandCampina, , Agrifirm, Kuehne + Nagel, DHL Supply Chain, Alliance Healthcare, ThyssenKrupp and Vanderlande Industries) have established centers in Veghel. \nIts shopping centre and marketplace earned the town the name of \"Pearl of the Meierij\". Veghel is an educational centre for the surrounding district: it has several secondary schools, a senior secondary vocational school, and the Pedagogic Academy, founded in 1872 and one of the oldest higher vocational schools in the area.\nSince 1994, Veghel and the neighbouring town of Erp have formed a single municipality.\nDemographics.\nTowns.\nPopulation figures as of 1 January 2015, ranked by size:\nPopulation centres.\nPopulation figures as of 1 January 2015, ranked by size:\nLanguage.\nThe language spoken by the native population is North Meierijs (an East Brabantian dialect, which is very similar to colloquial Dutch).\nNationalities.\nCompared to other towns in the region, the ethnic makeup of Veghel is relatively diverse. More than 22% of the town's population, or 17% of the municipality's population, is of foreign origin. In total, Veghel is home to people of more than a hundred different nationalities. About 90% of the municipality's total foreign population lives inside the town proper of Veghel.\nLocal festivals.\nEvery November sees the celebration of the entry of St Nicholas (\"Sinterklaas\").\nEvery two years in June or July, the Slokdarmfestival takes place.\nOn 1 September the harbour festival takes place.\nIn February or March the traditional carnival is held.\nTwin towns - sister cities.\nVeghel is twinned with:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Pamplona was the primary name of the kingdom until its union with Aragon (1076\u20131134). However, the territorial designation Navarre came into use as an alternative name in the late tenth century, and the name Pamplona was retained well into the twelfth century.\nHouse of \u00cd\u00f1iguez, 824?\u2013905.\nThe \u00cd\u00f1iguez dynasty are credited with founding the Navarrese kingdom (of Pamplona) in or around 824 when they are said to have risen against an attempt to extend Frankish (Carolingian) authority into the region. The Cordoban sources referred to them as sometimes-rebellious vassals, rather than in the manner used to refer to the Christian realms outside their control. They were supplanted in 905 when an anti-Cordoba coalition placed the succeeding Jim\u00e9nez dynasty in power.\nHouse of Jim\u00e9nez, 905\u20131234.\nIn 905, a coalition of neighbors forced Fort\u00fan Garc\u00e9s to retire to a monastery, and enthroned in his place a scion of a new dynasty. Under their reign, the name Navarre began to supplant that of Pamplona.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"template:sticky header/styles.css\"/&gt;\nWith the assassination of Sancho IV, Navarre was partitioned by his cousins Alfonso VI of Le\u00f3n and Sancho Ram\u00edrez of Arag\u00f3n, and the latter made king, leading to more than half a century of Aragonese control.\nThe death of Alfonso led to a succession crisis in Arag\u00f3n and the nobles of Navarre took advantage to reestablish an independent monarchy, crowning a grandnephew (through an illegitimate brother) of the assassinated Sancho IV.\nHouse of Champagne, 1234\u20131284.\nThe death of Sancho VII, the last of the Jim\u00e9nez kings, led to the crown of Navarre being inherited by the son of his sister Blanche, Countess of Champagne, she having been regent during much of her brother's reign.\nCapetian dynasty, 1284\u20131441.\nHouse of Capet, 1284\u20131349.\nHenry's unexpected death left his infant daughter Joan as the only heir to the throne. Joan's mother Blanche of Artois served as regent for the next ten years. In 1284 Joan was married to the future Philip IV of France, ending Blanche's regency. Philip assumed the throne of France a year later as \"King of France and Navarre\".\nHouse of \u00c9vreux, 1328\u20131441.\nAfter the deaths of Louis and his infant son John, his brothers Philip and Charles held the crowns of France and Navarre until their own deaths. At that time, the crown of France passed to Philip of Valois, a distant cousin who was not descended from Joan I, and the crown of Navarre was allowed to pass to Louis' daughter Joan II, despite her presumed illegitimacy. Joan reigned together with her husband Philip III until his death, and then alone until her own death. \nHouse of Trast\u00e1mara, 1425\u20131479.\nBlanche I reigned together with her husband John II. In 1458, John additionally inherited the crown of Aragon from his older brother; after his death, the Navarrese crown was given to Eleanor, the only living child of him and Blanche, while his Aragonese crown was given to Ferdinand II of Aragon, son of John and his second wife Juana Enr\u00edquez. \nClaimants.\nAfter Blanche's death in 1441, John retained the crown of Navarre for himself until he died 38 years later, keeping it from his son and elder daughter, Charles IV and Blanche II. Conflict with his son led to the Navarrese Civil War. Though some of the sources regard Charles and Blanche as the legitimate monarchs, the \"de facto\" king of Navarre was still John II. Eleanor did not claim to be the queen until her father's death.\nHouse of Foix, 1479\u20131517.\nEleanor, who had allied with her father against her brother and sister, outlived her father by only three weeks. By that time she was the widow of Gaston IV, Count of Foix, and their oldest son Gaston of Foix, Prince of Viana had also died. She was thus succeeded by her grandson Francis. \nHouse of Albret, 1484\u20131516.\nCatherine reigned together with her husband John III. After his death, she reigned alone for eight months until her own death. During their reign, Navarre was defeated by Ferdinand II of Aragon in 1512, resulting in the loss of all its territory south of the Pyrenees, including the royal capital of Pamplona. Ferdinand, the son of John II and his second wife and thus the half-brother of Catherine's grandmother Eleanor, was then crowned King of Navarre, and that branch of the title descended through the Aragonese and Spanish monarchs. Catherine and John III were left with Lower Navarre, that small fraction of the kingdom's former territory that is on the north side of the Pyrenees, which was united with other lands in France that were under their control.\nDivision of the kingdom.\nLower Navarre.\nIn 1530, Charles V decided to renounce definitively any claim to Lower Navarre due to the impossibility of controlling it, and because it was being effectively ruled by Henry II.

Acts may apply only to individual entities (called private laws), or to the general public (public laws). For a bill to become an act, the text must pass through both houses with a majority, then be either signed into law by the president of the United States, be left unsigned for ten days (excluding Sundays) while Congress remains in session, or, if vetoed by the president, receive a congressional override from &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;2\u20443 of both houses.\nPublic law, private law, designation.\nIn the United States, acts of Congress are designated as either public laws, relating to the general public, or private laws, relating to specific institutions or individuals. Since 1957, all Acts of Congress have been designated as \"Public Law X\u2013Y\" or \"Private Law X\u2013Y\", where X is the number of the Congress and Y refers to the sequential order of the bill (when it was enacted). For example, P. L. 111\u20135 (American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009) was the fifth enacted public law of the 111th United States Congress. Public laws are also often abbreviated as Pub. L. No. X\u2013Y.\nWhen the legislation of those two kinds are proposed, it is called public bill and private bill respectively.\nUsage.\nThe word \"act\", as used in the term \"act of Congress\", is a common, not a proper noun. The capitalization of the word \"act\" (especially when used standing alone to refer to an act mentioned earlier by its full name) is deprecated by some dictionaries and usage authorities. However, the Bluebook requires \"Act\" to be capitalized when referring to a specific legislative act. The United States Code capitalizes \"act\".\nThe term \"act of Congress\" is sometimes used in informal speech to indicate something for which getting permission is burdensome. For example, \"It takes an act of Congress to get a building permit in this town.\"\nPromulgation (United States).\nAn act adopted by simple majorities in both houses of Congress is promulgated, or given the force of law, in one of the following ways:\nThe president promulgates acts of Congress made by the first two methods. If an act is made by the third method, the presiding officer of the house that last reconsidered the act promulgates it.\nUnder the United States Constitution, if the president does not return a bill or resolution to Congress with objections before the time limit expires, then the bill automatically becomes an act; however, if the Congress is adjourned at the end of this period, then the bill dies and cannot be reconsidered (see pocket veto). If the president rejects a bill or resolution while the Congress is in session, a two-thirds vote of both houses of Congress is needed for reconsideration to be successful.\nPromulgation in the sense of publishing and proclaiming the law is accomplished by the president, or the relevant presiding officer in the case of an overridden veto, delivering the act to the archivist of the United States. The archivist provides for its publication as a slip law and in the United States Statutes at Large after receiving the act. Thereafter, the changes are published in the United States Code.\nJudicial review and constitutionality.\nThrough the process of judicial review, an act of Congress that violates the Constitution may be declared unconstitutional by the courts. A judicial declaration that an act of Congress is unconstitutional does not remove the act from the Statutes at Large or the United States Code; rather, it prevents the act from being enforced. However, the act as published in annotated codes and legal databases is marked with annotations indicating that it is no longer good law.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The optic nerve transmits visual information from the eye to the brain. Glaucoma may cause vision loss if left untreated. It has been called the \"silent thief of sight\" because the loss of vision usually occurs slowly over a long period of time. A major risk factor for glaucoma is increased pressure within the eye, known as intraocular pressure (IOP). It is associated with old age, a family history of glaucoma, and certain medical conditions or the use of some medications. The word \"glaucoma\" comes from the Ancient Greek word (), meaning 'gleaming, blue-green, gray'.\nOf the different types of glaucoma, the most common are called open-angle glaucoma and closed-angle glaucoma. Inside the eye, a liquid called aqueous humor helps to maintain shape and provides nutrients. The aqueous humor normally drains through the trabecular meshwork.\u00a0In open-angle glaucoma, the drainage is impeded, causing the liquid to accumulate and the pressure inside the eye to increase. This elevated pressure can damage the optic nerve. In closed-angle glaucoma, the drainage of the eye becomes suddenly blocked, leading to a rapid increase in intraocular pressure. This may lead to intense eye pain, blurred vision, and nausea. Closed-angle glaucoma is an emergency requiring immediate attention.\nIf treated early, the progression of glaucoma may be slowed or even stopped. Regular eye examinations, especially if the person is over 40 or has a family history of glaucoma, are essential for early detection. Treatment typically includes prescription of eye drops, medication, laser treatment or surgery. The goal of these treatments is to decrease eye pressure.\nGlaucoma is a leading cause of blindness in African Americans, Hispanic Americans, and Asians. Its incidence rises with age, to more than eight percent of Americans over the age of eighty, and closed-angle glaucoma is more common in women.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nEpidemiology.\nIn 2013 for the population aged 40-80 years, the global prevalence of glaucoma was estimated at 3.54%, thus affecting 64.3 million worldwide. The same year, 2.97 million people in North America had open-angle glaucoma. By 2040, the prevalence of all types of glaucoma was projected to increase to 111.82 million worldwide and to 4.72 million in North America.\nGlobally, glaucoma is the second-leading cause of blindness, while cataracts are a more common cause. In the United States, glaucoma is a leading cause of blindness for African Americans, who have higher rates of primary open-angle glaucoma, and Hispanic Americans. Bilateral vision loss can negatively affect mobility and interfere with driving.\nA meta-analysis published in 2009 found that people with primary open-angle glaucoma do not have increased mortality rates or increased risk of cardiovascular death.\nA 2024 \"JAMA Ophthalmology\" article reports that in 2022, an estimated 4.22 million people in the U.S. had glaucoma, with 1.49 million experiencing vision impairment due to the condition, according to a meta-analysis. The study found that Black adults were about twice as likely to be affected by glaucoma as White adults. Glaucoma prevalence was 1.62% among individuals aged 18 and older and 2.56% among those aged 40 and older, while vision-affecting glaucoma occurred in 0.57% and 0.91% of these age groups, respectively.\nSigns and symptoms.\nOpen-angle glaucoma usually presents with no symptoms early in the course of the disease, but it may gradually progress to involve difficulties with vision. It usually involves deficits in the peripheral vision followed by central vision loss as the disease progresses, but less commonly it may present as central vision loss or patchy areas of vision loss. On an eye examination, optic nerve changes are seen indicating damage to the optic nerve head (increased cup-to-disc ratio on fundoscopic examination).\nAcute angle-closure glaucoma, a medical emergency due to the risk of impending permanent vision loss, is characterized by sudden ocular pain, seeing halos around lights, red eye, very high intraocular pressure, nausea and vomiting, and suddenly decreased vision. Acute angle-closure glaucoma may further present with corneal edema, engorged conjunctival vessels, and a fixed and dilated pupil on examination.\nOpaque specks may occur in the lens in glaucoma, known as glaukomflecken. The word is German, meaning \"glaucoma-specks\".\nRisk factors.\nGlaucoma can affect anyone. Some people have a higher risk or susceptibility to develop glaucoma due to certain risk factors, including increasing age, high intraocular pressure, a family history of glaucoma, and use of steroid medications. \nOcular hypertension.\nOcular hypertension (increased pressure within the eye) is an important risk factor for glaucoma, but only about 10\u201370% of people, depending on ethnic group, with primary open-angle glaucoma actually have elevated ocular pressure. Ocular hypertension\u2014an intraocular pressure above the traditional threshold of or even above \u2014is not necessarily a pathological condition, but it increases the risk of developing glaucoma. \nA study with 1636 persons aged 40\u201380 who had an intraocular pressure above 24mmHg in at least one eye, but no indications of eye damages, showed that after five years, 9.5% of the untreated participants and 4.4% of the treated participants had developed glaucomatous symptoms, meaning that only about one in 10 untreated people with elevated intraocular pressure will develop glaucomatous symptoms over that period. Given these results, the clinical decision to treat everyone with elevated intraocular pressure with glaucoma therapy as a preventative measure is a matter of debate. As of 2018, most ophthalmologists favored treatment of those with additional risk factors.\nFor eye pressures, a value of above atmospheric pressure is often used, with higher pressures leading to a greater risk. However, some may have high eye pressure for years and never develop damage. Conversely, optic nerve damage may occur with normal pressure, known as normal-tension glaucoma. In case of above-normal intraocular pressure, the mechanism of open-angle glaucoma is believed to be the impeded exit of aqueous humor through the trabecular meshwork, while in closed-angle glaucoma, the iris blocks the trabecular meshwork. Diagnosis is achieved by performing an eye examination. Often, the optic nerve shows an abnormal amount of cupping.\nFamily history and genetics.\nPositive family history is a risk factor for glaucoma. The relative risk of having primary open-angle glaucoma is increased about two- to four-fold for people who have a sibling with glaucoma. Glaucoma, particularly primary open-angle glaucoma, is associated with mutations in several genes, including \"MYOC, ASB10, WDR36, NTF4\", \"TBK1\", and \"RPGRIP1.\" Many of these genes are involved in critical cellular processes that are implicated in the development and progression of glaucoma, including regulation of intraocular pressure, retinal ganglion cell health, and optic nerve function. Normal-tension glaucoma, which comprises 30-90% of primary open-angle glaucoma (depending on ethnic group), is also associated with genetic mutations (including \"OPA1\" and \"OPTN\" genes).\nAdditionally, some rare genetic conditions increase the risk of glaucoma, such as Axenfeld-Rieger syndrome and primary congenital glaucoma, which is associated with mutations in \"CYP1B1\" or \"LTBP2.\" They are inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion. Axenfeld-Rieger syndrome is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion and is associated with \"PITX2\" or \"FOXC1\".\nEthnicity.\nThe total prevalence of glaucoma is about the same in North America and Asia, but the prevalence of angle-closure glaucoma is four times higher in Asia than in North America.\nIn the United States, glaucoma is more common in African Americans, Latinos, and Asian-Americans.\nOther.\nOther factors can cause glaucoma, known as \"secondary glaucoma\", including prolonged use of steroids (steroid-induced glaucoma); conditions that severely restrict blood flow to the eye, such as severe diabetic retinopathy and central retinal vein occlusion (neovascular glaucoma); ocular trauma (angle-recession glaucoma); plateau iris; and inflammation of the middle layer of the pigmented vascular eye structure (uveitis), known as uveitic glaucoma.\nPathophysiology.\nThe main effect of glaucoma is damage to the optic nerve. Eventually, this damage leads to vision loss, which can deteriorate with time. The underlying cause of open-angle glaucoma remains unclear. Several theories exist on its exact etiology. Intraocular pressure is a function of the production of liquid aqueous humor by the ciliary processes of the eye, and its drainage through the trabecular meshwork. Aqueous humor flows from the ciliary processes into the posterior chamber, bounded posteriorly by the lens and the zonules of Zinn, and anteriorly by the iris. It then flows through the pupil of the iris into the anterior chamber, bounded posteriorly by the iris and anteriorly by the cornea.\nFrom here, the trabecular meshwork drains aqueous humor via the scleral venous sinus (Schlemm's canal) into scleral plexuses and general blood circulation.\nIn open/wide-angle glaucoma, flow is reduced through the trabecular meshwork due to the degeneration and obstruction of the trabecular meshwork, whose original function is to absorb the aqueous humor. Loss of aqueous humor absorption leads to increased resistance and thus a chronic, painless buildup of pressure in the eye.\nIn primary angle-closure glaucoma, the iridocorneal angle is narrowed or completely closed, obstructing the flow of aqueous humor to the trabecular meshwork for drainage. This is usually due to the forward displacement of the iris against the cornea, resulting in angle closure. This accumulation of aqueous humor causes an acute increase in pressure and damage to the optic nerve.\nThe pathophysiology of glaucoma is not well understood. Several theories exist regarding the mechanism of the damage to the optic nerve in glaucoma. The biomechanical theory hypothesizes that the retinal ganglion-cell axons (which form the optic nerve head and the retinal nerve fiber layer) are particularly susceptible to mechanical damage from increases in the intraocular pressure as they pass through pores at the lamina cribrosa. Thus, increases in intraocular pressure would cause nerve damage as seen in glaucoma. The vascular theory hypothesizes that a decreased blood supply to the retinal ganglion cells leads to nerve damage. This decrease in blood supply may be due to increasing intraocular pressures, and may also be due to systemic hypotension, vasospasm, or atherosclerosis. This is supported by evidence that those with low blood pressure, particularly low diastolic blood pressure, are at an increased risk of glaucoma. \nThe primary neurodegeneration theory hypothesizes that a primary neurodegenerative process may be responsible for degeneration at the optic nerve head in glaucoma. This would be consistent with a possible mechanism of normal tension glaucoma (those with open-angle glaucoma with normal eye pressures) and is supported by evidence showing a correlation of glaucoma with Alzheimer's dementia and other causes of cognitive decline.\nBoth experimental and clinical studies implicate that oxidative stress plays a role in the pathogenesis of open-angle glaucoma as well as in Alzheimer's disease.\nDegeneration of axons of the retinal ganglion cells (the optic nerve) is a hallmark of glaucoma. The inconsistent relationship of glaucomatous optic neuropathy with increased intraocular pressure has provoked hypotheses and studies on anatomic structure, eye development, nerve compression trauma, optic nerve blood flow, excitatory neurotransmitter, trophic factor, retinal ganglion cell or axon degeneration, glial support cell, immune system, aging mechanisms of neuron loss, and severing of the nerve fibers at the scleral edge.\nDiagnosis.\nScreening for glaucoma is an integral part of a standard eye examination performed by optometrists and ophthalmologists. The workup for glaucoma involves taking a thorough case history, with the emphasis on assessment of risk factors. \nThe baseline glaucoma evaluation tests include intraocular pressure measurement by using tonometry, anterior chamber angle assessment by optical coherence tomography, inspecting the drainage angle (gonioscopy), and retinal nerve fiber layer assessment with a fundus examination, measuring corneal thickness (pachymetry), and visual field testing.\nTypes.\nGlaucoma has been classified into specific types:\nPrimary glaucoma and its variants.\nPrimary glaucoma (H40.1-H40.2) includes primary open-angle glaucoma (chronic open-angle, chronic simple, glaucoma simplex), which can be high-tension or low-tension, and primary angle closure glaucoma (primary closed-angle, narrow-angle, pupil-block, acute congestive), which can manifest as acute, chronic, intermittent, or superimposed on chronic open-angle closure glaucoma (also called \"combined mechanism\" glaucoma).\nOther variants of primary glaucoma include:\nPrimary angle closure glaucoma is caused by contact between the iris and trabecular meshwork, which in turn obstructs outflow of the aqueous humor from the eye. This contact between the iris and trabecular meshwork (TM) may gradually damage the function of the meshwork until it fails to keep pace with aqueous production, and the pressure rises. In over half of all cases, prolonged contact between the iris and TM causes the formation of synechiae (effectively \"scars\").\nThese cause permanent obstruction of aqueous outflow. In some cases, pressure may rapidly build up in the eye, causing pain and redness (symptomatic, or so-called \"acute\"-angle closure). In this situation, the vision may become blurred, and halos may be seen around bright lights. Accompanying symptoms may include a headache and vomiting.\nDiagnosis is made from physical signs and symptoms - pupils mid-dilated and unresponsive to light, cornea edematous (cloudy), reduced vision, redness, and pain. However, the majority of cases are asymptomatic. Before the very severe loss of vision, these cases can only be identified by examination, generally by an eye-care professional.\nDevelopmental glaucoma.\nDevelopmental glaucoma (Q15.0)\nSecondary glaucoma.\nSecondary glaucoma (H40.3-H40.6) encompasses numerous subtypes: inflammatory glaucoma (all types of uveitis, Fuchs heterochromic iridocyclitis); phacogenic glaucoma (angle-closure with mature cataract, phacoanaphylactic glaucoma from lens capsule rupture, phacolytic glaucoma, lens subluxation); glaucoma secondary to intraocular hemorrhage (hyphema, hemolytic/erythroclastic glaucoma); traumatic glaucoma (angle recession glaucoma); postsurgical glaucoma (aphakic pupillary block, ciliary block); neovascular glaucoma; drug-induced glaucoma (corticosteroid-induced, alpha-chymotrypsin); and glaucoma of miscellaneous origin (associated with intraocular tumors, retinal detachments, severe chemical burns, essential iris atrophy, or toxic glaucoma).\nNeovascular glaucoma, an uncommon type of glaucoma, is difficult or nearly impossible to treat, and is often caused by proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) or central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO). It may also be triggered by other conditions that result in ischemia of the retina or ciliary body. Individuals with poor blood flow to the eye are highly at risk for this condition.\nNeovascular glaucoma results when new, abnormal vessels begin developing in the angle of the eye that begin blocking the drainage. People with such a condition begin to rapidly lose their eyesight. Sometimes, the disease appears very rapidly, especially after cataract surgery procedures.\nToxic glaucoma is open-angle glaucoma with an unexplained significant rise of intraocular pressure following an unknown pathogenesis. Intraocular pressure can sometimes reach . It characteristically manifests as ciliary body inflammation and massive trabecular edema that sometimes extends to Schlemm's canal. This condition is differentiated from malignant glaucoma by the presence of a deep and clear anterior chamber and a lack of aqueous misdirection. Also, the corneal appearance is not as hazy. A reduction in visual acuity can occur, followed by neuroretinal breakdown.\nAbsolute glaucoma.\nAbsolute glaucoma (H44.5) is the end stage of all types of glaucoma. The eye has no vision, absence of pupillary light reflex and pupillary response, and has a stony appearance. Severe pain is present in the eye. The treatment of absolute glaucoma is a destructive procedure, like cyclocryoapplication, cyclophotocoagulation, or injection of 99% alcohol.\nVisual field defects in glaucoma.\nIn glaucoma visual field defects result from damage to the retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL). Field defects are seen mainly in primary open angle glaucoma. Because of the unique anatomy of the RNFL, many noticeable patterns are seen in the visual field. Most of the early glaucomatous changes are seen within the central visual field, mainly in Bjerrum's area, 10-20\u00b0 from fixation.\nThe following are the common glaucomatous field defects:\nScreening.\nThe United States Preventive Services Task Force stated, as of 2013, that there was insufficient evidence to recommend for or against screening for glaucoma. Therefore, there is no national screening program in the US. Screening, however, is recommended starting at age 40 by the American Academy of Ophthalmology.\nThere is no screening program in the UK; however, opportunistic testing is recommended for at-risk groups, including free eye tests.\nTreatment.\nThe goal of glaucoma management for patients with increased intraocular pressure is to decrease the intraocular pressure (IOP), thus slowing the progression of glaucoma and preserving the quality of life for patients, with minimal side-effects. This requires appropriate diagnostic techniques and follow-up examinations, and judicious selection of treatments for the individual patient. Although increased IOP is only one of the major risk factors for glaucoma, lowering it via various pharmaceuticals and/or surgical techniques is currently the mainstay of glaucoma treatment. \nVascular flow and neurodegenerative theories of glaucomatous optic neuropathy have prompted studies on various neuroprotective therapeutic strategies, including nutritional compounds, some of which may be regarded by clinicians as safe for use now, while others are on trial.&lt;ref name=\"DOI10.1016/B978-0-323-88442-6.00039-X\"&gt;Yu Jun Wo, Ching\u2010Yu Cheng, Rachel S.

The choice of\u00a0medication usually depends on the dose, duration, and side effects of each medication. However, in general, prostaglandin analogues are the first-line treatment for glaucoma.\nProstaglandin analogues, such as latanoprost, bimatoprost, and travoprost, reduce the IOP by increasing the aqueous fluid outflow through the draining angle. It is usually prescribed once daily at night. The systemic side effects of this class are minimal. However, they can cause local side effects, including redness of the conjunctiva, a change in the iris color, and eyelash elongation.\nSeveral other classes of medications could be used as a second-line in case of\u00a0treatment failure or presence of contraindications to prostaglandin analogues. These include:\nEach of these medicines may have local and systemic side effects. Wiping the eye with an absorbent pad after the administration of eye drops may result in fewer adverse effects. Initially, glaucoma drops may reasonably be started in either one or in both eyes.\nAdherence.\nPoor compliance with medications and follow-up visits are a major reason for treatment failure and disease progression in glaucoma patients. Poor adherence could lead to increased complication rates, thus increasing the need for non-pharmacological interventions, including surgery. Patient education and communication must be ongoing to sustain successful treatment plans for this lifelong disease with no early symptoms.\nLaser.\nArgon laser trabeculoplasty (ALT) may be used to treat open-angle glaucoma, but this is a temporary solution, not a cure. A 50-\u03bcm argon laser spot is aimed at the trabecular meshwork to stimulate the opening of the mesh to allow more outflow of aqueous fluid. Usually, half of the angle is treated at a time. Traditional laser trabeculoplasty uses a thermal argon laser in an argon laser trabeculoplasty procedure.\nNd:YAG laser peripheral iridotomy (LPI) may be used in patients susceptible to or affected by angle closure glaucoma or pigment dispersion syndrome. During laser iridotomy, laser energy is used to make a small, full-thickness opening in the iris to equalize the pressure between the front and back of the iris, thus correcting any abnormal bulging of the iris. In people with narrow angles, this can uncover the trabecular meshwork. In some cases of intermittent or short-term angle closure, this may lower the eye pressure. Laser iridotomy reduces the risk of developing an attack of acute angle closure. In most cases, it also reduces the risk of developing chronic angle closure or of adhesions of the iris to the trabecular meshwork. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations have shown that an optimal iridotomy size to relieve the pressure differential between the anterior and posterior side of the iris is around 0.1\u00a0mm to 0.2\u00a0mm. This coincides with clinical practice of LPI where an iridotomy size of 150 to 200 microns is commonly used. However, larger iridotomy sizes are sometimes necessary.\nSurgery.\nBoth laser and conventional surgeries are performed to treat glaucoma. Surgery is the primary therapy for those with congenital glaucoma. Generally, these operations are a temporary solution, as there is not yet a cure for glaucoma.\nCanaloplasty.\nCanaloplasty is a nonpenetrating procedure using microcatheter technology. To perform a canaloplasty, an incision is made into the eye to gain access to the Schlemm's canal, similarly to a viscocanalostomy. A microcatheter will circumnavigate the canal around the iris, enlarging the main drainage channel and its smaller collector channels through the injection of a sterile, gel-like material called viscoelastic. The catheter is then removed, and a suture is placed within the canal and tightened.\nBy opening the canal, the pressure inside the eye may be relieved, although the reason is unclear, since the canal (of Schlemm) does not have any significant fluid resistance in glaucoma or healthy eyes. Long-term results are not available.\nTrabeculectomy.\nThe most common conventional surgery performed for glaucoma is the trabeculectomy. Here, a partial thickness flap is made in the scleral wall of the eye, and a window opening is made under the flap to remove a portion of the trabecular meshwork. The scleral flap is then sutured loosely back in place to allow fluid to flow out of the eye through this opening, resulting in lowered intraocular pressure and the formation of a bleb or fluid bubble on the surface of the eye.\nScarring can occur around or over the flap opening, causing it to become less effective or lose effectiveness altogether. Traditionally, chemotherapeutic adjuvants, such as mitomycin C (MMC) or 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), are applied with soaked sponges on the wound bed to prevent filtering blebs from scarring by inhibiting fibroblast proliferation. Contemporary alternatives to prevent the scarring of the meshwork opening include the sole or combinative implementation of nonchemotherapeutic adjuvants such as the Ologen collagen matrix, which has been clinically shown to increase the success rates of surgical treatment.\nCollagen matrix prevents scarring by randomizing and modulating fibroblast proliferation in addition to mechanically preventing wound contraction and adhesion.\nGlaucoma drainage implants.\nThe first glaucoma drainage implant was developed in 1966. Since then, several types of implants have followed on from the original: the Baerveldt tube shunt, or the valved implants, such as the Ahmed glaucoma valve implant or the ExPress Mini Shunt and the later generation pressure ridge Molteno implants. These are indicated for glaucoma patients not responding to maximal medical therapy, with previous failed guarded filtering surgery (trabeculectomy). The flow tube is inserted into the anterior chamber of the eye, and the plate is implanted underneath the conjunctiva to allow a flow of aqueous fluid out of the eye into a chamber called a bleb.\nThe ongoing scarring over the conjunctival dissipation segment of the shunt may become too thick for the aqueous humor to filter through. This may require preventive measures using antifibrotic medications, such as 5-fluorouracil or mitomycin-C (during the procedure), or other nonantifibrotic medication methods, such as collagen matrix implant, or biodegradable spacer, or later on create a necessity for revision surgery with the sole or combinative use of donor patch grafts or collagen matrix implant.\nLaser-assisted nonpenetrating deep sclerectomy.\nThe most common surgical approach currently used for the treatment of glaucoma is trabeculectomy, in which the sclera is punctured to alleviate intraocular pressure.\nNonpenetrating deep sclerectomy (NPDS) surgery is a similar, but modified, procedure, in which instead of puncturing the scleral bed and trabecular meshwork under a scleral flap, a second deep scleral flap is created, excised, with further procedures of deroofing the Schlemm's canal, upon which, percolation of liquid from the inner eye is achieved and thus alleviating intraocular pressure, without penetrating the eye. NPDS is demonstrated to have significantly fewer side effects than trabeculectomy. However, NPDS is performed manually and requires higher level of skills that may be assisted with instruments. In order to prevent wound adhesion after deep scleral excision and to maintain good filtering results, NPDS as with other non-penetrating procedures is sometimes performed with a variety of biocompatible spacers or devices, such as the Aquaflow collagen wick, ologen Collagen Matrix, or Xenoplast glaucoma implant.\nLaser-assisted NPDS is performed with the use of a CO2 laser system. The laser-based system is self-terminating once the required scleral thickness and adequate drainage of the intraocular fluid have been achieved. This self-regulation effect is achieved as the CO2 laser essentially stops ablating as soon as it comes in contact with the intraocular percolated liquid, which occurs as soon as the laser reaches the optimal residual intact layer thickness.\nClear lens extraction.\nFor people with chronic closed-angle glaucoma, lens extraction can relieve the block created by the pupil and help regulate the intraocular pressure. A study found that CLE is even more effective than laser peripheral iridotomy in patients with angle closure glaucoma. A systematic review comparing lens extraction and laser peripheral iridotomy for treating acute primary angle closure found that lens extraction potentially provides better intraocular pressure control and reduces medication needs over time. However, it remains uncertain if it significantly lowers the risk of recurrent episodes or reduces the need for additional operations.\nTreatment approaches for primary glaucoma.\nPrimary angle closure glaucoma: Once any symptoms have been controlled, the first line (and often definitive) treatment is laser iridotomy. This may be performed using either Nd:YAG or argon lasers, or in some cases by conventional incisional surgery. The goal of treatment is to reverse and prevent contact between the iris and the trabecular meshwork. In early to moderately advanced cases, iridotomy is successful in opening the angle in around 75% of cases. In the other 25%, laser iridoplasty, medication (pilocarpine), or incisional surgery may be required.\nPrimary open-angle glaucoma: Prostaglandin agonists work by opening uveoscleral passageways. Beta-blockers, such as timolol, work by decreasing aqueous formation. Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors decrease bicarbonate formation from ciliary processes in the eye, thus decreasing the formation of aqueous humor. Parasympathetic analogs are drugs that work on the trabecular outflow by opening up the passageway and constricting the pupil. Alpha 2 agonists (brimonidine, apraclonidine) both decrease fluid production (via inhibition of AC) and increase drainage. A review of people with primary open-angle glaucoma and ocular hypertension concluded that medical IOP-lowering treatment slowed down the progression of visual field loss.\nNeovascular glaucoma.\nAnti-VEGF agents as injectable medications, along with other standard of care treatment for decreasing intraocular pressure, may improve pressure in people with neovascular glaucoma for short periods. Evidence suggests that this improvement may last 4\u20136 weeks. There is no sufficient evidence to suggest that anti-VEGF medications are effective either for short-term or for longer-term treatment. The short, medium, and long-term safety of anti-VEGF treatment has not been well investigated.\nPrognosis.\nIn open-angle glaucoma, the typical progression from normal vision to complete blindness takes about 25 years to 70 years without treatment, depending on the method of estimation used.\nHistory.\nThe association of elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) and glaucoma was first described by Englishman Richard Banister in 1622: \"...that the Eye be grown more solid and hard, then naturally it should be...\". Angle-closure glaucoma was treated with cataract extraction by John Collins Warren in Boston as early as 1806. The invention of the ophthalmoscope by Hermann Helmholtz in 1851 enabled ophthalmologists for the first time to identify the pathological hallmark of glaucoma, the excavation of the optic nerve head due to retinal ganglion cell loss. The first reliable instrument to measure intraocular pressure was invented by Norwegian ophthalmologist Hjalmar August Schi\u00f8tz in 1905. About half a century later, Hans Goldmann in Bern, Switzerland, developed his applanation tonometer, which, still today, despite numerous innovations in diagnostics, is considered the gold standard of determining this crucial pathogenic factor. In the late 20th century, further pathomechanisms beyond elevated IOP were discovered and became the subject of research, like insufficient blood supply, often associated with low or irregular blood pressure, to the retina and optic nerve head. The first drug to reduce IOP, pilocarpine, was introduced in the 1870s; other major innovations in pharmacological glaucoma therapy were the introduction of beta blocker eye drops in the 1970s and of prostaglandin analogues and topical (locally administered) carbonic anhydrase inhibitors in the mid-1990s. Early surgical techniques like iridectomy and fistulating methods have recently been supplemented by less invasive procedures like small implants, a range of options now widely called MIGS (micro-invasive glaucoma surgery).\nEtymology.\nThe word \"glaucoma\" comes from the Ancient Greek , a derivative of \"(glaukos),\" which commonly described the color of eyes which were not dark (i.e. blue, green, light gray). Eyes described as due to disease might have had a gray cataract in the Hippocratic era, or, in the early Common Era, the greenish pupillary hue sometimes seen in angle-closure glaucoma. This colour is reflected in the Chinese word for glaucoma, \u9752\u5149\u773c \"(q\u012bnggu\u0101ngy\u01cen),\" literally \"cyan-light eye\". An alternative hypothesis connects the name to the Ancient Greek noun for 'owl', or (both \"glaux\").\nResearch.\nEye drops vs. other treatments.\nThe TAGS randomised controlled trial investigated whether eye drops or trabeculectomy is more effective in treating advanced primary open-angle glaucoma. After two years, researchers found that vision and quality of life are similar in both treatments. At the same time, eye pressure was lower in people who underwent surgery, and in the long run, surgery is more cost-effective.\nThe LiGHT trial compared the effectiveness of eye drops and selective laser trabeculoplasty for open-angle glaucoma. Both contributed to a similar quality of life, but most people undergoing laser treatment were able to stop using eye drops. Laser trabeculoplasty was also shown to be more cost-effective.\nComparison of effects of brimonidine and timolol.\nA 2013 Cochrane systematic review compared the effect of brimonidine and timolol in slowing the progression of open-angle glaucoma in adult participants. The results showed that participants assigned to brimonidine showed less visual field progression than those assigned to timolol, though the results were not significant, given the heavy loss-to-followup and limited evidence. The mean intraocular pressures for both groups were similar. Participants in the brimonidine group had a higher occurrence of side effects caused by medication than participants in the timolol group.\nSocial disparities in glaucoma care and research.\nA study conducted in the UK showed that people living in an area of high deprivation were likely to be diagnosed in the later stage of the disease. It also showed that there was a lack of professional ophthalmic services in the area of high deprivation.\nA study in 2017 shows that there is a huge difference in the volume of glaucoma testing depending on the type of insurance in the US. Researchers reviewed 21,766 persons aged \u2265 40 years old with newly diagnosed open-angle glaucoma (OAG) and found that Medicaid recipients had substantially lower volume of glaucoma testing performed compared to patients with commercial health insurance.\nResults from a meta-analysis of 33,428 primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) participants published in 2021 suggest that there are substantial ethnic and racial disparities in clinical trials in the US. Although ethnic and racial minorities have a higher disease burden, the 70.7% of the study participants was White as opposed to 16.8% Black and 3.4% Hispanic/Latino.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The Miller cycle was patented by Ralph Miller, an American engineer, https:// dated Dec 24, 1957. The engine may be two- or four-stroke and may be run on diesel fuel, gases, or dual fuel. It uses a supercharger or a turbocharger to offset the performance loss of the Atkinson cycle.\nThis type of engine was first used in ships and stationary power-generating plants, and is now used for some railway locomotives such as the GE PowerHaul. It was adapted by Mazda for their KJ-ZEM V6, used in the Millenia sedan, and in their Eunos 800 sedan (Australia) luxury cars. Subaru combined a Miller-cycle flat-4 with a hybrid driveline for their concept \"Turbo Parallel Hybrid\" car, known as the Subaru B5-TPH. Nissan introduced a small three-cylinder engine with variable intake valve timing that claims to operate an Atkinson cycle at low load (thus the lower power density is not a handicap) and a Miller cycle when under light boost.\nOverview.\nA traditional reciprocating internal combustion engine uses four strokes, of which two can be considered high-power: the compression stroke (high power flow from crankshaft to the charge) and power stroke (high power flow from the combustion gases to crankshaft).\nIn the Miller cycle, the intake valve is left open longer than it would be in an Otto-cycle engine. In effect, the compression stroke is two discrete cycles: the initial portion when the intake valve is open and final portion when the intake valve is closed. This two-stage compression stroke creates the so-called \"fifth\" stroke that the Miller cycle introduces. As the piston initially moves upwards in what is traditionally the compression stroke, the charge is partially expelled back out through the still-open intake valve. Typically, this loss of charge air would result in a loss of power. However, in the Miller cycle, this is compensated for by the use of a supercharger. The supercharger typically will need to be of the positive-displacement (Roots or screw) type due to its ability to produce boost at relatively low engine speeds. Otherwise, low-speed power will suffer. Alternatively, a turbocharger can be used for greater efficiency, if low-speed operation is not required, or supplemented with electric motors.\nIn the Miller-cycle engine, the piston begins to compress the fuel-air mixture only after the intake valve closes; and the intake valve closes after the piston has traveled a certain distance above its bottom-most position: around 20 to 30% of the total piston travel of this upward stroke. So in the Miller cycle engine, the piston actually compresses the fuel-air mixture only during the latter 70% to 80% of the compression stroke. During the initial part of the compression stroke, the piston pushes part of the fuel-air mixture through the still-open intake valve, and back into the intake manifold.\nCharge temperature.\nThe charge air is compressed using a supercharger (and cooled by an intercooler) to a pressure higher than that needed for the engine cycle, but filling of the cylinders is reduced by suitable timing of the inlet valve. Thus the expansion of the air and the consequent cooling take place in the cylinders and partially in the inlet. Reducing the temperature of the air/fuel charge allows the power of a given engine to be increased without making any major changes such as increasing the cylinder/piston compression relationship. When the temperature is lower at the beginning of the cycle, the air density is increased without a change in pressure (the mechanical limit of the engine is shifted to a higher power). At the same time, the thermal load limit shifts due to the lower mean temperatures of the cycle.\nThis allows ignition timing to be advanced beyond what is normally allowed before the onset of detonation, thus increasing the overall efficiency still further. An additional advantage of the lower final charge temperature is that the emission of NOx in diesel engines is decreased, which is an important design parameter in large diesel engines on board ships and power plants.\nCompression ratio.\nEfficiency is increased by having the same effective compression ratio and a larger expansion ratio. This allows more work to be extracted from the expanding gases as they are expanded almost to atmospheric pressure. In an ordinary spark ignition engine at the end of the expansion stroke of a wide open throttle cycle, the gases are at around five atmospheres when the exhaust valve opens. Because the stroke is limited to that of the compression, still some work could be extracted from the gas. Delaying the closing of the intake valve in the Miller cycle in effect shortens the compression stroke compared to the expansion stroke. This allows the gases to be expanded to atmospheric pressure, increasing the efficiency of the cycle. \nSupercharger losses or turbocharger lag.\nThe benefits of using positive-displacement superchargers come with a cost due to parasitic load. About 15 to 20% of the power generated by a supercharged engine is usually required to do the work of driving the supercharger, which compresses the intake charge (also known as boost). On the other hand while turbochargers aren't as high in terms of being a parasitic load, the spooling up of the turbine from the exhaust gases would result in the engine being stuck in the Atkinson cycle at lower RPM. This inconsistency could in principle be addressed with techniques like the MGU-H that was used in Formula 1 but this has never been implemented on commercial engines and much less specifically on Atkinson cycle engines. \nMajor advantage/drawback.\nThe major advantage of the cycle is that the expansion ratio is greater than the compression ratio. By intercooling after the external supercharging, an opportunity exists to reduce NOx emissions for diesel, or knock for spark ignition engines. However, multiple tradeoffs on boosting system efficiency and friction (due to the larger displacement) need to be balanced for every application.\nSummary of the patent.\nThe overview given above may describe a modern version of the Miller cycle, but it differs in some respects from the 1957 patent. The patent describes \"a new and improved method of operating a supercharged intercooled engine\". The engine may be two-cycle or four-cycle and the fuel may be diesel, dual fuel, or gas. It is clear from the context that \"gas\" means gaseous fuel and not gasoline. The pressure-charger shown in the diagrams is a turbocharger, not a positive-displacement supercharger. The engine (whether four-stroke or two-stroke) has a conventional valve or port layout, but an additional \"compression control valve\" (CCV) is in the cylinder head. The servo mechanism, operated by inlet manifold pressure, controls the lift of the CCV during part of the compression stroke and releases air from the cylinder to the exhaust manifold. The CCV would have maximum lift at full load and minimum lift at no load. The effect is to produce an engine with a variable compression ratio. As inlet manifold pressure goes up (because of the action of the turbocharger) the effective compression ratio in the cylinder goes down (because of the increased lift of the CCV) and vice versa. This \"will insure proper starting and ignition of the fuel at light loads\".\nAtkinson-cycle engine.\nA similar delayed valve-closing method is used in some modern versions of Atkinson cycle engines, but without the supercharging. These engines are generally found on hybrid electric vehicles, where efficiency is the goal, and the power lost compared to the Miller cycle is made up through the use of electric motors."}

He was a patrician Claudian but his mother was from a plebeian family. He was the son of Livia Drusilla and the stepson of her second husband, the Emperor Augustus. He was also brother of the Emperor Tiberius; the father of the Emperor Claudius and general Germanicus; paternal grandfather of the Emperor Caligula, and maternal great-grandfather of the Emperor Nero.\nDrusus launched the first major Roman campaigns across the Rhine and began the conquest of Germania, becoming the first Roman general to reach the Weser and Elbe rivers. In 12 BC, he led a successful campaign into Germania, subjugating the Sicambri. Later that year he led a naval expedition against Germanic tribes along the North Sea coast, conquering the Batavi and the Frisii, and defeating the Chauci near the mouth of the Weser. In 11 BC, he conquered the Usipetes and the Marsi, extending Roman control to the Upper Weser. In 10 BC, he launched a campaign against the Chatti and the resurgent Sicambri, subjugating both. The following year, while serving as consul, he conquered the Mattiaci and defeated the Marcomanni and the Cherusci, the latter near the Elbe. His Germanic campaigns were cut short in the summer of 9 BC by his death after a riding accident.\nDrusus was a very able commander. His death slowed the northward expansion of the Roman Empire, and foreshadowed the disastrous Battle of the Teutoburg Forest. He was enormously popular among his men, who erected the Drususstein in his honor; his memory was elevated during the reign of his son Claudius. Drusus' accomplishments in battle were considerable. He fought numerous Germanic chiefs in single combat, and was likely the fourth and final Roman to achieve the \"spolia opima\" (for taking the armor and weapons of an enemy king after defeating him in single combat), though he died before he could be honored for it.\nEarly life.\nChildhood.\nDrusus was the youngest son of Livia Drusilla from her marriage to Tiberius Claudius Nero, who was legally declared his father before the couple divorced. Drusus was born between mid-March and mid-April 38 BC, three months after Livia married Augustus on 17 January. Gerhard Radke has proposed the date of 28 March as his most likely birthday, while Lindsay Powell interprets Ovid's \"Fasti\" as indicating a date of 13 January. Rumors arose that Augustus was the child's real father, although impossible as Livia was already pregnant when she met her future husband (Emperor Claudius nonetheless encouraged the rumor during his reign to create an impression of more direct lineage from Augustus).\nDrusus was raised in Claudius Nero's house with his brother, the future emperor Tiberius, until his legal father's death. The two brothers developed a famously close relationship that would last the rest of their lives. Tiberius named his eldest son after his brother, although eldest sons were usually named after their father or grandfather. Drusus named his second son (future emperor Claudius) after Tiberius.\nName.\nAccording to Suetonius, Drusus was originally given the name \"Decimus\" as his praenomen, but his full name was later changed to \"Nero Claudius Drusus\". It is not known when or why the change occurred. The names were unusual at the time, both putting heavy emphasis on his maternal ancestry by using Livia's father's cognomen instead of that of her husband; in his original name the use of the praenomen Decimus was also atypical for prevalent families of the late Republic (especially for a patrician). The eventual use of his father's cognomen Nero as a praenomen was highly unconventional as well. His full name given at his \"Dies lustricus\" is generally assumed to have been \"Decimus Claudius Drusus\", but some historians such as Andrew Pettinger, Pierre Grimal, T. P. Wiseman, Greg Rowe, Barbara Levick and Eric D. Huntsman believe it may have been \"Decimus Claudius Nero\", \"Decimus Claudius Nero Drusus\" or \"Decimus Claudius Drusus Nero\" instead.\nLivia may have passed down her father's cognomen to her son simply because, besides her adoptive brother Marcus Livius Drusus Libo, there was no one else to pass it down for the future. In 1988 C.J. Simpson asserted that there are three moments in history where the name change is probable to have happened; when his brother Tiberius was adopted by Marcus Gallius, when their father died in 33 BC, or when he assumed the toga virilis. Simpson personally argued against the time of adoption of his brother as a plausible time for his name change since Simpson believed the event may even have happened before Drusus was born; he also rejected the point of death of their father as likely since it would have probably have brought attention to the circumstances surrounding Livia's divorce and remarriage, which had become a part of Mark Antony's propaganda at the time. Simpson stated that in his opinion Livia chose the names Decimus and Drusus for her younger son to minimize association with her ex-husband after she married Octavian due to the former's poor status at the time, but that several years after the man's death it was opportune to emphasize her younger son's connection with his elder brother and that the name change was probably done upon him assuming the toga virilis. Levick believed the adoption of Tiberius necessitated Drusus wearing the name of the Nerones. Simpson responded 1993 in that he believes that Levick's interpretation is incompatible with Suetonius account as he cannot accept that Livia and Octavian (once married) would have allowed the adoption of the boy to take place at all, due to Gallius opposition of Octavian. Since Seutonius makes it clear that Tiberius did use Gallius name (although briefly) but dropped it out of respect for his step-father the adoption must have happened before Drusus was born.\nJean Mottershead proposed in her commentary of Suetonius's \"Divus Claudius\" that Drusus' \"praenomen\" derived from his father's maternal side of the family, possibly the Junii or Laelii as they were the only senatorial families who regularly used the praenomen \"Decimus\". She also believes that the name change happened when his father died and he moved into Octavian's household. Klaus Scherberich is critical of Mottershead's proposal, he argues that there are no examples of a conservative patrician family like the Claudii Nerones adopting a completely new praenomen from a maternal ancestor, especially when said gentes were non-patrician. Scherberich is also sceptical of Simpson's explanation.\nLindsay Powell believes that Drusus personally (despite his young age) may have changed his name directly after his father's death to preserve and honor his memory. In his opinion another motivation for the boy may have been the meaning of the name \"Nero\", which in ancient Sabine (the language of the people which the Claudii descended from) meant \"strong\" or \"valiant\", a fitting name for a boy from such a distinguished clan.\nMarriage.\nDrusus married Antonia Minor, the daughter of Mark Antony and Augustus' sister, Octavia Minor, and gained a reputation of being completely faithful to her. Their children were Germanicus, Claudius, a daughter named Livilla ('little Livia'), and at least two others who did not survive childhood. After Drusus' death, Antonia never remarried, though she outlived him by nearly five decades. Three emperors were direct descendants of Drusus: his son Claudius, his grandson Caligula, and his great-grandson Nero.\nCareer.\nAugustus bestowed many honors on his stepsons. In 19 BC, Drusus was granted the ability to hold all public offices five years before the minimum age. When Tiberius left Italy during his term as praetor in 16 BC, Drusus legislated in his place. He became quaestor the following year, fighting against Raetian bandits in the Alps. Drusus repelled them, gaining honors, but was unable to smash their forces, and required reinforcement from Tiberius. The brothers easily defeated the local Alpine tribes.\nDrusus arrived in Gaul in late 15 BC to serve as \"legatus Augusti pro praetore\" (governor on Augustus' behalf with the authority of a praetor) of the three Gaulish provinces. His contribution to the ongoing building and urban development in Gaul can be seen in the establishment of the \"pes Drusianus\", or \u2018Drusian foot\u2019, of about , which was in use in Samarobriva (modern Amiens) and among the Tungri. From 14 to 13 BC, Augustus himself was also active in Gaul, whether in Lugdunum (modern Lyon) or along the Rhine frontier.\nAs governor of Gaul, Drusus made his headquarters at Lugdunum, where he decided to establish the \"concilium Galliarum\" or \u2018council of the Gaulish provinces\u2019 sometime between 14 and 12 BC. This council would elect from its members a priest to celebrate games and venerate Rome and Augustus as deities every 1 August at the altar of the three Gauls that Drusus established at Condate in 10 BC. Drusus' son Tiberius\u2014the future emperor Claudius\u2014was born in Lugdunum on the same day that this altar was inaugurated.\nGermanic campaigns.\nStarting in 14 BC, Drusus built a string of military bases along the Rhine\u2014fifty according to Florus\u2014and established an alliance with the Batavi in preparation for military action in Germania Libera. He is likely to have had seven legions under his command. In spring of 12 BC, he embarked an expeditionary force, perhaps consisting of the Legiones I Germanica and V Alaudae, by ship from the vicinity of modern Nijmegen, making use of one or more canals he had built for the purpose. Drusus sailed to the mouth of the Ems and penetrated into the territory of the Chauci in present-day Lower Saxony. The Chauci concluded a treaty acknowledging Roman supremacy, and would remain allies of Rome for years to come. As they continued to ascend the Ems, the Romans were attacked by the Bructeri in boats. Drusus' forces defeated the Bructeri, but, as it was now late in the campaign season, turned back for their winter quarters in Gaul, taking advantage of their new alliance with the Frisii to navigate through the difficult conditions on the North Sea.\nAs a reward for the successes of his campaign in 12 BC, Drusus was made \"praetor urbanus\" for 11 BC when he returned to Rome for the winter. News of Drusus' achievements\u00a0\u2013 navigating the North Sea, carrying the Roman eagles into new territory, and fixing new peoples into treaty relations with Rome\u00a0\u2013 caused considerable excitement in Rome and were commemorated on coins.\nIn the spring of his term as \"praetor urbanus\", he set out for the German border once more. This time, he assembled a force consisting of all or part of five legions in addition to auxiliaries and, setting out from Vetera on the Rhine, ascended the River Lippe. Here he encountered the Tencteri and Usipetes, whom he defeated in two separate engagements. He reached the Werra Valley before deciding to turn back for the season, as winter was coming on, supplies were dwindling, and the omens were unfavorable. While his forces were making their way back through the territory of the Cherusci, the latter tribe laid an ambush for them at Arbalo. The Cherusci failed to capitalize on their initial advantage, whereupon the Romans broke through their lines, defeated the Germanic attackers, and acclaimed Drusus as \"imperator\". To show his continued mastery of the ground, Drusus garrisoned a number of positions within Germania during the winter of 11\u201310 BC, including one somewhere in Hesse and one in Cheruscan territory, probably either at Haltern or Bergkamen-Oberaden, both in present-day North Rhine\u2013Westphalia.\nHe rejoined his wife Antonia and two children for a time in Lugdunum before the family returned to Rome, where Drusus reported to Augustus. Drusus was given the honor of an ovation, and for the third time, Augustus closed the doors of the Temple of Janus, signifying that the whole Roman world was then at peace.\nDrusus was granted the office of proconsul for the following year. In 10 BC, the Chatti joined with the Sicambri and attacked Drusus' camp, but they were driven back. Drusus pursued them, proceeding from the sites of present-day Mainz and , where he set up a base of supply, to Hedem\u00fcnden, where a strong new camp was established. Around this time, the canny Marcomannic king Maroboduus responded to the Roman incursion by relocating his people \"en masse\" to Bohemia. In summer of 10 BC, Drusus left the field in order to return to Lugdunum, where he inaugurated the sanctuary of the Three Gaulish provinces at Condate on 1 August. Augustus and Tiberius were in Lugdunum for this occasion (when Drusus' youngest son Claudius was born), and afterwards Drusus accompanied them back to Rome.\nDrusus easily won election as consul for the year 9 BC. Once more he left the city before assuming office. His consulship conferred the chance for Drusus to attain Rome's highest and rarest military honor, the \"spolia opima\", or spoils of an enemy chieftain slain personally by an opposing Roman general who was fighting (as consuls did) under his own auspices. He quickly returned to the field, stopping to confer with his staff at Lugdunum and to dedicate a temple to Caesar Augustus at Andemantunnum, before rejoining his command at Mainz, from which the year's expedition departed in early spring. Drusus led the army via R\u00f6dgen through the territories of the Marsi and Cherusci until he even crossed the river Elbe. Here he is said to have seen an apparition of a Germanic woman who warned him against proceeding farther and that his death was near. Drusus turned back, erecting a trophy to commemorate his reaching the Elbe, perhaps on the site of Dresden or Magdeburg.\nDrusus had sought out multiple Germanic (at least three) chieftains during his campaigns in Germany (12 BC\u20139 BC), engaging them in \"dazzling displays of single combat\". The sources are ambiguous, but suggest that he could have potentially taken the \"spolia opima\" from a Germanic king, thus becoming the fourth and final Roman to gain this honor. Regardless of whether he was actually able to take them in combat, however, Drusus' untimely death would prevent him from ever going through with the official ceremony. Notably, after Drusus' death, Augustus deposited the laurels from his \"fasces\" not in the Temple of Jupiter Optimus Maximus as he had done in the past, but in the Temple of Jupiter Feretrius. J.W. Rich suggests that this action was done as an affirmation to Drusus' memory; had the young commander lived, he would have placed \"spolia opima\" in the temple himself.\nDeath and legacy.\nDrusus was returning from his advance to the Elbe when he fell from his horse, by which point Tiberius had joined him. Though he survived the initial accident, infection set in, and he died about a month later. Shortly before his death he wrote a letter to Tiberius complaining about the style in which Augustus ruled and discussed forcing him to restore the republic. Suetonius reports that he had refused to return to Rome just before his death. Drusus' body was brought back to the city, and his ashes were deposited in the Mausoleum of Augustus. He remained extremely popular with the legionaries, who erected a monument (the Drususstein) in \"Mogontiacum\" (modern Mainz) on his behalf. Remnants of this are still standing.\nThe Senate raised an arch on the Appian Way in his memory (unrelated to the Arch of Drusus) which read \"DE GERM\" and depicted his Elbe trophy as well as him fighting on horseback, a testament to his personal bravery. They also posthumously granted him the hereditary honorific title \"Germanicus\", which was given to his eldest son before passing to his youngest. It would be used by many members of the Julio-Claudian dynasty, including its last three emperors: his grandson Caligula, his son Claudius, and his great-grandson Nero. Augustus later wrote a biography of him which does not survive. By Augustus' decree, festivals were held in Mogontiacum at Drusus' death day and probably also on his birthday.\nDrusus' mother Livia, much affected by the death of her second son, took the advice of the philosopher Areus to put up many statues and images of Drusus and speak often about him. The surviving Latin work \"Consolatio ad Liviam\" is framed as an Ovidian message of consolation to Livia on this occasion, though it is generally considered a literary exercise \"composed between the death of Livia [AD 29] and that of Tiberius [AD 37]\".\nAugustus noted the successes of Drusus' campaigns\u2014for which, as Drusus' superior, he took credit\u2014in his \"Res Gestae Divi Augusti\", written in 14 AD:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;I restored peace to the provinces of Gaul and Spain, likewise Germany, which includes the ocean from Cadiz to the mouth of the river Elbe. [...] I sailed my ships on the ocean from the mouth of the Rhine to the east region up to the borders of the Cimbri, where no Roman had gone before that time by land or sea, and the Cimbri and the Charydes and the Semnones and the other Germans of the same territory sought by envoys the friendship of me and of the Roman people.\u2014\u200a\nUpon Claudius' accession to the principate in 41 AD, his late father Drusus received new public honors, including annual games in the Circus Maximus on 14 January for Drusus' birthday, coin issues depicting Drusus' likeness and his commemorative arch, and the restoration of a monument near the Ara Pacis Augustae that featured a statue of Drusus. Claudius also completed a road from Italy into Raetia that followed the route Drusus had taken and whose road-markers commemorated Drusus' achievements in the Alpine war. Such Claudian commemorations of Drusus' memory are thought to have become less prominent once Claudius had his own British triumph to celebrate.\nHistorian Michael McNally considers Drusus to have been the most able of the various Roman commanders who attempted to conquer Germania, as well as the most successful. While the furthest extent of territorial gains would be realized the year after his death, under Tiberius, Drusus' death marked a slowing of Roman expansion. Drusus' successors would prove unfit for the task of conquering Germania, with disastrous results. Drusus was succeeded as commander in Germania by Tiberius, but Tiberius fell out of imperial favor, and chose self exile in 6 BC. Command then fell to Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus. Ahenobarbus was partly successful, becoming the first and last Roman general to cross the Elbe river, but was generally bogged down in suppressing revolts. Command then fell to Publius Quinctilius Varus, under whom the Battle of the Teutoburg Forest (also called the Varian disaster) would occur. The destruction of Varus' entire army marked the end of northward Roman expansion. The Rhine became the de facto border of the Roman empire, rendering moot much of Drusus' life work.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

She was known as Julia Augusta after her formal adoption into the Julia \"gens\" in AD\u00a014.\nLivia was the daughter of senator Marcus Livius Drusus Claudianus and his wife Alfidia. She married Tiberius Claudius Nero around 43\u00a0BC, and they had two sons, Tiberius and Drusus. In 38\u00a0BC, she divorced Tiberius Claudius Nero and married the political leader Octavian. The Senate granted Octavian the title \"Augustus\" in\u00a027 BC, effectively making him emperor. In her role as Roman empress, Livia served as an influential confidant to her husband and was rumoured to have been responsible for the deaths of several of his relatives, including his grandson Agrippa Postumus.\nAfter Augustus died in AD\u00a014, Tiberius was elevated, and Livia continued to exert political influence as the mother of the emperor until her death in AD\u00a029. She was grandmother of the emperor Claudius, great-grandmother of the emperor Caligula, and great-great-grandmother of the emperor Nero. Livia was deified by Claudius in AD\u00a042, bestowing her the title \"Diva Augusta\".\nBirth and first marriage to Tiberius Claudius Nero.\nLivia Drusilla was born on 30 January 59 BC as the daughter of Marcus Livius Drusus Claudianus by his wife Alfidia. The diminutive \"Drusilla\" often found in her name suggests that she was not her father's first daughter. She may have had a brother named Gaius Livius Drusus who had two daughters named Livia Pulchra and Livilla. Her father also adopted Marcus Livius Drusus Libo.\nShe was married around 43 BC to Tiberius Claudius Nero, her cousin of patrician status who was fighting with her father on the side of Julius Caesar's assassins against Octavian. Her father committed suicide in the Battle of Philippi, along with Gaius Cassius Longinus and Marcus Junius Brutus, but her husband continued fighting against Octavian, now on behalf of Mark Antony and his brother Lucius Antonius. Her first child, the future emperor Tiberius, was born in 42 BC. In 40 BC, the family was forced to flee Italy in order to avoid the recriminations of Octavian in the aftermath of the siege of Perusia. They joined with Sextus Pompeius, a son of Pompey Magnus, who opposed the Second Triumvirate from his base in Sicily. Later, Livia, her husband Tiberius Nero and their two-year-old son, Tiberius, moved on to Greece.\nWife to Augustus.\nAfter peace was established between the Triumvirate and the followers of Sextus Pompeius, a general amnesty was announced, and Livia returned to Rome, where she was personally introduced to Octavian in 39 BC. At this time, Livia already had a son, the future emperor Tiberius, and was pregnant with the second, Nero Claudius Drusus (also known as Drusus the Elder). Legend said that Octavian fell immediately in love with her, despite the fact that he was still married to Scribonia. Octavian divorced Scribonia on 30 October 39 BC, the very day Scribonia gave birth to his only biological child, daughter Julia the Elder. \nSeemingly around that time, when Livia was six months pregnant with her second child, Tiberius Claudius Nero was persuaded or forced by Octavian to divorce Livia. She gave birth on 14 January; three days later Octavian married Livia after waiving the traditional waiting period. On the day of his wedding to Livia, Octavian received a supposed omen of an eagle dropping a white hen with a laurel branch in its mouth into Livia's lap. This omen was interpreted as being an indication toward Livia's fertility, as she had given birth to two sons in her short four years of marriage to Nero. This was ironic because her first pregnancy by Augustus ended in a stillbirth, and she was unable to ever conceive another child. Tiberius Claudius Nero was present at the wedding, giving her in marriage \"just as a father would.\" The importance of the patrician Claudii to Octavian's cause, and the political survival of the Claudii Nerones are probably more rational explanations for the tempestuous union. Nevertheless, Livia and Augustus remained married for the next 51 years, despite the fact that they had no children apart from the single stillbirth. She always enjoyed the status of privileged counselor to her husband, petitioning him on the behalf of others and influencing his policies, an unusual role for a Roman wife in a culture dominated by the pater familias.\nAfter Mark Antony's suicide following the Battle of Actium in 31 BC, Octavian returned to Rome triumphant; on 16 January 27 BC, the Senate bestowed upon him the honorary title of \"Augustus\" (\"honorable\" or \"revered one\"). Augustus rejected monarchical titles, instead choosing to refer to himself as \"Princeps Civitatis\" (\"First Citizen of the State\") or \"Princeps Senatus\" (\"First among the Senate\"). He and Livia formed the role model for Roman households. Despite their wealth and power, Augustus' family continued to live modestly in their house on the Palatine Hill. Livia would set the pattern for the noble Roman \"matrona\". She wore neither excessive jewelry nor pretentious costumes; she took care of the household and her husband (often making his clothes herself), always faithful and dedicated. In 35 BC, Octavian gave Livia the unprecedented honor of ruling her own finances and dedicated a public statue to her. She owned and effectively administered copper mines in Gaul, estates of palm groves in Judea, and dozens of papyrus marshes in Egypt. She had her own circle of clients and pushed many prot\u00e9g\u00e9s into political offices, including the grandfathers of the later emperors Galba and Otho.\nWith Augustus being the father of only one daughter (Julia by Scribonia), Livia revealed herself to be an ambitious mother and soon started to push her own sons, Tiberius and Drusus, into power. Drusus was a trusted general and married Augustus' favorite niece, Antonia Minor, having three children: the popular general Germanicus, Livilla, and the future emperor Claudius. Drusus was killed in a riding accident only a few years later, dying in 9 BC. This was also the same year in which Livia was honored by the dedication of the Ara Pacis Augustae as a birthday present. Tiberius married Augustus' daughter Julia in 11 BC and was ultimately adopted as Augustus' heir in AD 4.\nRumor had it that Livia was behind the death of Augustus' nephew Marcellus in 23 BC. After Julia's two elder sons by Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa, whom Augustus had adopted as sons and successors, had died, the one remaining son, Agrippa Postumus, was adopted at the same time as Tiberius, but later Agrippa Postumus was sent into exile and finally killed. Tacitus charges that Livia was not altogether innocent of these deaths and Cassius Dio also mentions such rumours. There are also rumors mentioned by Tacitus and Cassius Dio that Livia brought about Augustus' death by poisoning fresh figs, although modern historians view this as unlikely. Augustus' granddaughter was Julia the Younger. Sometime between AD 1 and 14, her husband Lucius Aemilius Paullus was executed as a conspirator in a revolt. Modern historians theorize that Julia's exile was not actually for adultery but for involvement in Paullus' revolt. Tacitus alleged that Livia had plotted against her stepdaughter's family and ruined them. Julia died in AD 29 on the island to which she had been sent in exile twenty years earlier.\nReign of Tiberius.\nAugustus died on 19 August AD 14, being deified by the senate shortly afterward. In his will, he left one third of his property to Livia, and the other two thirds to Tiberius. In the will, he also adopted her into the Julian family and granted her the honorific title of \"Augusta\". These dispositions permitted Livia to maintain her status and power after her husband's death, under the new name of Julia Augusta. Tacitus and Cassius Dio wrote that rumours persisted that Augustus was poisoned by Livia, but these are mainly dismissed as malicious fabrications spread by political enemies of the dynasty. The most famous of these rumors was that Livia, unable to poison his food in the kitchens because Augustus insisted on only eating figs picked fresh from his garden, smeared each fruit with poison while still on the tree to preempt him. In Imperial times, a variety of fig cultivated in Roman gardens was called the \"Liviana\", perhaps because of her reputed horticultural abilities, or as a tongue-in-cheek reference to this rumor.\nFor some time, Livia and her son Tiberius, the new emperor, appeared to get along with each other. Speaking against her became treason in AD 20, and in AD 24 he granted his mother a theater seat among the Vestal Virgins. Livia exercised unofficial but very real power in Rome. Eventually, Tiberius became resentful of his mother's political status, particularly against the idea that it was she who had given him the throne. At the beginning of his reign Tiberius vetoed the unprecedented title \"Mater Patriae\" (\"Mother of the Fatherland\") that the Senate wished to bestow upon her, in the same manner in which Augustus had been named \"Pater Patriae\" (\"Father of the Fatherland\") (Tiberius also consistently refused the title of \"Pater Patriae\" for himself).\nThe historians Tacitus and Cassius Dio depict an overweening, even domineering dowager, ready to interfere in Tiberius\u2019 decisions. The most notable instances were the cases of Urgulania, grandmother of Claudius's first wife Plautia Urgulanilla, who correctly assumed that her friendship with the empress placed her above the law; and Munatia Plancina, suspected of murdering Germanicus and saved at Livia's entreaty. (Plancina committed suicide in AD 33 after being accused again of murder after Livia's death.) A notice from AD 22 records that Julia Augusta (Livia) dedicated a statue to Augustus in the center of Rome, placing her own name even before that of Tiberius.\nAncient historians give as a reason for Tiberius' retirement to Capri his inability to endure his mother any longer. Until AD 22 there had, according to Tacitus, been \"a genuine harmony between mother and son, or a hatred well concealed;\" Dio tells us that at the time of his accession already Tiberius heartily loathed her.\nDeath and aftermath.\nIn AD 22 she had fallen ill, and Tiberius hastened back to Rome in order to be with her. But in AD 29 when she finally fell ill and died, he remained on Capri, pleading pressure of work and sending Caligula to deliver the funeral oration. Suetonius adds the macabre detail that \"when she died... after a delay of several days, during which he held out hope of his coming, [she was at last] buried because the condition of the corpse made it necessary...\". Divine honours he also vetoed, stating that this was in accord with her own instructions. Later he vetoed all the honours the Senate had granted her after her death and cancelled the fulfillment of her will.\nIt was not until 13 years later, in AD 42 during the reign of her grandson Claudius, that all her honours were restored and her deification finally completed. She was named \"Diva Augusta\" (\"The Divine Augusta\"), and an elephant-drawn chariot conveyed her image to all public games. A statue of her was set up in the Temple of Augustus along with her husband's, races were held in her honor, and women were to invoke her name in their sacred oaths. Her and Augustus' tomb was later sacked at an unknown date.\nHer Villa ad Gallinas Albas north of Rome is currently being excavated; its famous frescoes of imaginary garden views may be seen at the National Roman Museum. One of the most famous statues of Augustus (the Augustus of Prima Porta) came from the grounds of the villa.\nPersonality.\nWhile reporting various unsavory hearsay, the ancient sources generally portray Livia as a woman of proud and queenly attributes, faithful to her imperial husband. Dio records two of her utterances: \"Once, when some naked men met her and were to be put to death in consequence, she saved their lives by saying that to a chaste woman such men are in no way different from statues. When someone asked her how she had gained respect from Augustus, she answered that it was by being scrupulously chaste herself, doing gladly whatever pleased him, not meddling with any of his affairs, and, in particular, by pretending neither to hear nor to notice the favourites of his passion.\"\nWith the passage of time, however, some thought that with widowhood a haughtiness and an overt craving for power and the outward trappings of status came increasingly to the fore. Livia had always been a principal beneficiary of the climate of adulation that Augustus had done so much to create, and which Tiberius despised (\"a strong contempt for honours\", Tacitus, \"Annals\" 4.37). In AD 24, whenever she attended the theatre, a seat among the Vestals was typically reserved for her (\"Annals\" 4.16), but this may have been intended more as an honour for the Vestals than for her (cf. Ovid, \"Tristia\", 4.2.13f, \"Epist. ex Ponto\" 4.13.29f).\nLivia played a vital role in the formation of her children Tiberius and Drusus. Attention focuses on her part in the divorce of her first husband, father of Tiberius, in 39/38 BC. Her role in this is unknown, as well as in Tiberius's divorce of Vipsania Agrippina in 12 BC at Augustus's insistence: whether it was merely neutral or passive, or whether she actively colluded in Caesar's wishes.\nLegacy.\nThe Roman tribe Livia was named in her honor.\nIn literature and popular culture.\nIn ancient literature.\nThe ancient sources all agree that Livia was Augustus' best confidant and counselor, but the extent of her influence remained disputed due to the numerous attempts by her political enemies to defame her dynasty. According to Suetonius, who had access to imperial records, Augustus would write down lists of items to be discussed with Livia, and then take careful notes of her replies to be consulted again later.\nIn Tacitus' \"Annals\", meanwhile, Livia is famously depicted as having great influence, to the extent where she \"had the aged Augustus firmly under control\u2014so much so that he exiled his only surviving grandson to the island of Planasia\"; Tacitus goes on to call her \"a real catastrophe to the nation as a mother, and to the house of the Caesars as a stepmother\" and \"a compliant wife, but an overbearing mother\".\nLivia's image appears in ancient visual media such as coins and portraits. Following Octavia the Younger, Cleopatra and possibly Fulvia, she was the third (or fourth) woman to appear on provincial coins in 16 BC. On official Roman coinage, she was probably portrayed as Salus Augusta on the dupondius of Tiberius. Her portrait images can be chronologically identified partially from the progression of her hair designs, which represented more than keeping up with the fashions of the time as her depiction with such contemporary details translated into a political statement of representing the ideal Roman woman. Livia's image evolves with different styles of portraiture that trace her effect on imperial propaganda that helped bridge the gap between her role as wife to the emperor Augustus, to mother of the emperor Tiberius. Becoming more than the \"beautiful woman\" she is described as in ancient texts, Livia serves as a public image for the idealization of Roman feminine qualities, a motherly figure, and eventually a goddesslike representation that alludes to her virtue. Livia's power in symbolizing the renewal of the Republic with the female virtues \"Pietas\" and \"Concordia\" in public displays had a dramatic effect on the visual representation of future imperial women as ideal, honorable mothers and wives of Rome. Livia also restored the temple of the \"Bona Dea.\"\nLivia is mentioned by Pliny the Elder, who describes the vines of the Pulcino wine (\"Vinum Pucinum\" - today at best \"Prosecco\"). This then special and rare wine from the sunny slopes northeast of Barcola in the direction of the place Prosecco or Duino (near the historic place Castellum Pucinum) was according to Pliny the favorite wine of the Empress Livia. She is said to have loved this Vinum Pucinum for its medicinal properties and at the end of her long life (she was 87) she attributed her old age to its consumption and commended it to everyone as an \"elixir for a long life\".\nIn modern literature.\nIn the popular fictional work \"I, Claudius\" by Robert Graves\u2014based on Tacitus' innuendo\u2014Livia is portrayed as a thoroughly Machiavellian, scheming political mastermind. Determined never to allow republican governance to flower again, as she felt they led to corruption and civil war, and devoted to bringing Tiberius to power and then maintaining him there, she is involved in nearly every death or disgrace in the Julio-Claudian family up to the time of her death. On her deathbed she only fears divine punishment for all she had done, and secures the promise of future deification by her grandson Claudius, an act which, she believes, will guarantee her a blissful afterlife. However, this portrait of her is balanced by her intense devotion to the well-being of the Empire as a whole, and her machinations are justified as a necessarily cruel means to what she firmly considers a noble aspiration: the common good of the Romans, achievable only under strict imperial rule.\nIn John Maddox Roberts's short story \"The King of Sacrifices,\" set in his SPQR series, Livia hires Decius Metellus to investigate the murder of one of Julia the Elder's lovers. In \"Antony and Cleopatra\" by Colleen McCullough, Livia is portrayed as a cunning and effective advisor to her husband, whom she loves passionately. Luke Devenish's \"Empress of Rome\" novels, \"Den of Wolves\" (2008) and \"Nest of Vipers\" (2010), have Livia as a central character in a fictionalized account of her life and times.\nLivia plays an important role in two Marcus Corvinus mysteries by David Wishart, \"Ovid\" (1995) and \"Germanicus\" (1997). She is mentioned posthumously in \"Sejanus\" (1998).\nOn television and film.\nThe 2021 Sky Atlantic series \"Domina\" relates the rise of the Roman Principate with a focus on Livia's role and relationships. She is portrayed as having sworn a sacred oath to her father's shade to restore the Republic and to be playing a long con to that effect in concert with Gn. Calpurnius Piso. The child Livia is played by Meadow Nobrega, the adolescent and young adult Livia by Nadia Parkes, and the adult Livia by Kasia Smutniak.\nDescendants.\nHer marriage with Augustus produced only one pregnancy, which miscarried. However, through her sons by her first husband, Tiberius and Drusus, she was a direct ancestor of all of the Julio-Claudian emperors as well as most of the extended Julio-Claudian imperial family.\n1.

She was a niece of the Emperor Augustus, sister-in-law of the Emperor Tiberius, paternal grandmother of the Emperor Caligula and Empress Agrippina the Younger, mother of the Emperor Claudius, and maternal great-grandmother and paternal grandaunt of the Emperor Nero. She outlived her husband Nero Claudius Drusus, her oldest son, her daughter, and several of her grandchildren.\nBiography.\nBirth and early life.\nShe was born in Athens, and after 36\u00a0BC was taken to Rome by her mother with her siblings. She was the youngest of five. Her mother had three children, named Claudia Marcella Major, Claudia Marcella Minor, and Marcus Claudius Marcellus, from her first marriage and another daughter, named Antonia Major, by the same father (Mark Antony). Antonia never knew her father; Mark Antony divorced her mother in 32\u00a0BC and committed suicide in 30\u00a0BC.\nShe was raised by her mother, her uncle, and her aunt, Livia Drusilla and inherited properties in Italy, Greece, and Egypt. She was said to have received visitors to her house, such as Valerius Asiaticus and Lucius Vitellius, a consul and the father of the future emperor Aulus Vitellius.\nMarriage and family.\nIn 16\u00a0BC, she married the Roman general and future consul (9\u00a0BC) Nero Claudius Drusus. Drusus was the stepson of her uncle Augustus, second son of Livia Drusilla, and brother of future Emperor Tiberius. They had many children, but only three survived: the famous general Germanicus, Livilla, and the Roman Emperor Claudius.\nA poem by Crinagoras of Mytilene mentions Antonia's first pregnancy, which may be of a child before Germanicus who must have died in infancy or early childhood.\nDrusus died in 9 June BC in Germany, due to complications from injuries he sustained after falling from a horse. After his death, although pressured by her uncle to remarry, she never did.\nAntonia raised her children in Rome. Tiberius adopted Germanicus in 4\u00a0AD. Germanicus died in 19\u00a0AD, allegedly poisoned through the handiwork of Gnaeus Calpurnius Piso and Munatia Plancina. Tacitus suggests but does not outright say in \"Annals\" 3.3 that, on the orders of Tiberius and Livia Drusilla, Antonia was forbidden to go to his funeral. When Livia Drusilla died in June of 29\u00a0AD, Antonia took care of her younger grandchildren Caligula, Agrippina the Younger, Julia Drusilla, Julia Livilla, and later Claudia Antonia.\nConflict with Livilla.\nIn 31\u00a0AD, a plot by her daughter Livilla and Tiberius\u2019 notorious Praetorian prefect, Sejanus, to murder the Emperor Tiberius and Caligula and to seize the throne for themselves, was exposed by Apicata, the estranged ex-wife of Sejanus. Livilla allegedly poisoned her husband, Tiberius' son, Drusus Julius Caesar (nicknamed \"Castor\"), in 23\u00a0AD to remove him as a rival.\nSejanus was executed before Livilla was implicated in the crime. After Apicata's accusation, which came in the form of a letter to the emperor, several co-conspirators were executed while Livilla was handed over to her mother for punishment. Cassius Dio states that Antonia imprisoned Livilla in her room until she starved to death.\nSuccession of Caligula and death.\nWhen Tiberius died, Caligula became emperor in March 37\u00a0AD. Caligula awarded her a senatorial decree, granting her all the honors that Livia Drusilla had received in her lifetime. She was also offered the title of \"Augusta\", previously only given to Augustus's wife Livia, but rejected it.\nAntonia died on 1 May 37. Suetonius and Cassius Dio claim she was driven to suicide by Caligula. According to Barrett, But since he had not reached Rome until 28 March, and was absent from the city for much of April, collecting the remains of his mother and brother, there would hardly have been much time to drive Antonia to her death by insulting behaviour. It is also difficult to imagine that he would have paid her no honours on her death, as Suetonius implies. She died at a time when the euphoria of the beginning of his reign was still rampant, and quite apart from any question of personal affection, a public slight at this time to the most respected woman in Rome, whose death was marked in local Fasti, would have been politically unimaginable.\nWhen Claudius became emperor after his nephew's assassination in 41\u00a0AD, he gave his mother the title of \"Augusta\". Her birthday became a public holiday, which had yearly games and public sacrifices held. An image of her was paraded in a carriage.\nCultural depictions.\nShe is remembered in \"De Mulieribus Claris\", a collection of biographies of historical and mythological women by the Florentine author Giovanni Boccaccio, composed in 1361\u201362. It is notable as the first collection devoted exclusively to biographies of women in Western literature.\nAntonia is one of the main characters in the novel \"I, Claudius\". In the 1976 television adaptation of the book she is portrayed by Margaret Tyzack. She is a loyal wife deeply in love with her husband Nero Claudius Drusus. However, she is unloving towards her son Claudius, whom she regards as a fool. Furthermore, after finding evidence that Livilla murdered her husband Drusus Julius Caesar and rightfully believing she was also poisoning her daughter for the same reason, she kills Livilla by locking her in her room until she starves to death. During the reign of Caligula she is so disgusted by the state of Rome that she commits suicide.\nShe is a leading character in the novel by Lindsey Davis, \"The Course of Honour\" (1997), where she guides and advises Claudius and his supporters.\nIn the 1968 ITV historical drama \"The Caesars\", Antonia was indirectly mentioned by Tiberius (played by Andr\u00e9 Morell), who noted that Germanicus was a blood relative of Augustus on his mother's [Antonia] side.\nColleen Dewhurst portrayed Antonia opposite Susan Sarandon as Livilla in the 1985 miniseries \"A.D.\"\nIsabelle Connolly (adult) and Beau Gadsdon (child) portrayed Antonia in British-Italian historical drama television series \"Domina\" (2021).\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

A hybrid SACD contains a Compact Disc Digital Audio (CDDA) layer and can also be played on a standard CD player.\nHistory.\nThe Super Audio CD format was introduced in 1999, and is defined by the \"Scarlet Book\" standard document. Philips and Crest Digital partnered in May 2002 to develop and install the first SACD hybrid disc production line in the United States, with a production capacity of up to three million discs per year. SACD did not achieve the level of growth that compact discs enjoyed in the 1980s, and was not accepted by the mainstream market.\nBy 2007, SACD had failed to make a significant impact in the marketplace; consumers were increasingly downloading low-resolution music files over the internet rather than buying music on physical disc formats. A small and niche market for SACD has remained, serving the audiophile community.\nContent.\nMany popular artists have released some or all of their back catalog on SACD. Pink Floyd's album \"The Dark Side of the Moon\" (1973) sold over 800,000 copies by June 2004 in its SACD Surround Sound edition. The Who's rock opera \"Tommy\" (1969), and Roxy Music's \"Avalon\" (1982), were released on SACD to take advantage of the format's multi-channel capability. All three albums were remixed in 5.1 surround, and released as hybrid SACDs with a stereo mix on the standard CD layer.\nSome popular artists have released new recordings on SACD. Sales figures for Sting's \"Sacred Love\" (2003) album reached number one on SACD sales charts in four European countries in June 2004.\nBetween 2007 and 2008, the rock band Genesis re-released all of their studio albums across three SACD box sets. Each album in these sets contains both new stereo and 5.1 mixes. The original stereo mixes were not included. The US &amp; Canada versions do not use SACD but CD instead.\nBy August 2009, 443 labels had released one or more SACDs.\nMany SACD discs that were released from 2000 to 2005 are now out of print and available only on the used market. By 2009, the major record companies were no longer regularly releasing discs in the format, with new releases confined to the smaller labels.\nTechnology.\nSACD discs have identical physical dimensions as standard compact discs. The areal density of the disc is the same as a DVD. There are three types of disc:\nA stereo SACD recording has an uncompressed rate of 5.6\u00a0Mbit/s, four times the rate for Red Book CD stereo audio.\nCommercial releases commonly include both surround sound (five full-range plus LFE multi-channel) and stereo (dual-channel) mixes on the SACD layer. Some reissues retain the mixes of earlier multi-channel formats (examples include the 1973 quadraphonic mix of Mike Oldfield's \"Tubular Bells\" and the 1957 three-channel stereo recording by the Chicago Symphony Orchestra of Mussorgsky's \"Pictures at an Exhibition\", reissued on SACD in 2001 and 2004 respectively).\nDisc reading.\nObjective lenses in conventional CD players have a longer working distance, or focal length, than lenses designed for SACD players. In SACD-capable DVD, Blu-ray and Ultra HD Blu-ray players, the red DVD laser is used for reading SACDs. This means that when a hybrid SACD is placed into a conventional CD player, the infrared laser beam passes through the SACD layer and is reflected by the CD layer at the standard 1.2\u00a0mm distance, and the SACD layer is out of focus. When the same disc is placed into an SACD player, the red laser is reflected by the SACD layer (at 0.6\u00a0mm distance) before it can reach the CD layer. Conversely, if a conventional CD is placed into an SACD player, the laser will read the disc as a CD since there is no SACD layer.\nDirect Stream Digital.\nSACD audio is stored in Direct Stream Digital (DSD) format using pulse-density modulation (PDM) where audio amplitude is determined by the varying proportion of 1s and 0s. This contrasts with compact disc and conventional computer audio systems using pulse-code modulation (PCM) where audio amplitude is determined by numbers encoded in the bit stream. Both modulations require neighboring samples to reconstruct the original waveform; the more neighboring samples, the lower the frequency that can be encoded.\nDSD is 1-bit, has a sampling rate of 2.8224\u00a0MHz, and makes use of noise shaping quantization techniques in order to push 1-bit quantization noise up to inaudible ultrasonic frequencies. This gives the format a greater dynamic range and wider frequency response than the CD. The SACD format is capable of delivering a dynamic range of 120\u00a0dB from 20\u00a0Hz to 20\u00a0kHz and an extended frequency response up to 100\u00a0kHz, although most available players list an upper limit of 70\u201390\u00a0kHz, and practical limits reduce this to 50\u00a0kHz. Because of the nature of sigma-delta converters, DSD and PCM cannot be directly compared. DSD's frequency response can be as high as 100\u00a0kHz, but frequencies that high compete with high levels of ultrasonic quantization noise. With appropriate low-pass filtering, a frequency response of 20\u00a0kHz can be achieved along with a dynamic range of nearly 120\u00a0dB, which is about the same dynamic range as PCM audio with a resolution of 20 bits.\nDirect Stream Transfer.\nTo reduce the space and bandwidth requirements of DSD, a lossless data compression method called Direct Stream Transfer (DST) is used. DST compression is compulsory for multi-channel regions and optional for stereo regions. It typically compresses by a factor of between two and three, allowing a disc to contain 80 minutes of both 2-channel and 5.1-channel sound.\nDirect Stream Transfer compression was standardized as an amendment to the MPEG-4 Audio standard, ISO/IEC 14496-3:2001/Amd 6:2005 (Lossless coding of oversampled audio), in 2005. It contains the DSD and DST definitions as described in the Super Audio CD Specification. The MPEG-4 DST provides lossless coding of oversampled audio signals. Target applications of DST are archiving and storage of 1-bit oversampled audio signals and SA-CD.\nA reference implementation of MPEG-4 DST was published as ISO/IEC 14496-5:2001/Amd.10:2007 in 2007.\nCopy protection.\nSACD has several copy protection features at the physical level, which made the digital content of SACD discs difficult to copy until the jailbreak of the PlayStation 3. The content may be copyable without SACD quality by resorting to the analog hole, or ripping the conventional 700\u00a0MB layer on hybrid discs. Copy protection schemes include physical pit modulation and 80-bit encryption of the audio data, with a key encoded on a special area of the disc that is only readable by a licensed SACD device. The HD layer of an SACD disc cannot be played back on computer CD/DVD drives, and SACDs can only be manufactured at the disc replication facilities in Shizuoka and Salzburg.\nNonetheless, very early versions of the PlayStation 3 with an SACD-compatible drive and appropriate firmware and certain Blu-ray players can use specialized software to extract a DSD copy of the HD stream.\nSound quality.\nSound quality parameters achievable by the Red Book CD-DA and SACD formats compared with the limits of human hearing are as follows:\nIn September 2007, the Audio Engineering Society published the results of a year-long trial, in which a range of subjects\u2014including professional recording engineers\u2014were asked to discern the difference between high-resolution audio sources (including SACD and DVD-Audio) and a compact disc audio (44.1\u00a0kHz/16 bit) conversion of the same source material under double-blind test conditions. Out of 554 trials, there were 276 correct answers, a 49.8% success rate corresponding almost exactly to the 50% that would have been expected by chance guessing alone. When the level of the signal was elevated by 14\u00a0dB or more, the test subjects were able to detect the higher noise floor of the CD-quality loop easily. The authors commented:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Now, it is very difficult to use negative results to prove the inaudibility of any given phenomenon or process. There is always the remote possibility that a different system or more finely attuned pair of ears would reveal a difference. But we have gathered enough data, using sufficiently varied and capable systems and listeners, to state that the burden of proof has now shifted. Further claims that careful 16/44.1 encoding audibly degrades high resolution signals must be supported by properly controlled double-blind tests.\nFollowing criticism that the original published results of the study were not sufficiently detailed, the AES published a list of the audio equipment and recordings used during the tests. Since the Meyer\u2013Moran study in 2007, approximately 80 studies have been published on high-resolution audio, about half of which included blind tests. Joshua Reiss performed a meta-analysis on 20 of the published tests that included sufficient experimental detail and data. In a paper published in the July 2016 issue of the AES Journal, Reiss says that, although the individual tests had mixed results, and that the effect was \"small and difficult to detect,\" the overall result was that trained listeners could distinguish between high-resolution recordings and their CD equivalents under blind conditions: \"Overall, there was a small but statistically significant ability to discriminate between standard-quality audio (44.1 or 48 kHz, 16 bit) and high-resolution audio (beyond standard quality). When subjects were trained, the ability to discriminate was far more significant.\" Hiroshi Nittono pointed out that the results in Reiss's paper showed that the ability to distinguish high-resolution audio from CD-quality audio was \"only slightly better than chance.\"\nContradictory results have been found when comparing DSD and high-resolution PCM formats. Double-blind listening tests in 2004 between DSD and 24-bit, 176.4\u00a0kHz PCM recordings reported that among test subjects no significant differences could be heard. DSD advocates and equipment manufacturers continue to assert an improvement in sound quality above PCM 24-bit 176.4\u00a0kHz. A 2003 study found that despite both formats' extended frequency responses, people could not distinguish audio with information above 21\u00a0kHz from audio without such high-frequency content. In a 2014 study, however, Marui et al. found that under double-blind conditions, listeners were able to distinguish between PCM (192\u00a0kHz/24 bits) and DSD (2.8\u00a0MHz) or DSD (5.6\u00a0MHz) recording formats, preferring the qualitative features of DSD, but could not discriminate between the two DSD formats.\nPlayback hardware.\nIn 1999, the Sony SCD-1 player was introduced concurrently with the SACD format, at a price of approximately US$5,000 (). It weighed over and played two-channel SACDs and Red Book CDs only. Electronics manufacturers, including Onkyo, Denon, Marantz, Pioneer, and Yamaha, offer or offered SACD players. Sony has made in-car SACD players.\nIn order to play back SACD content digitally without any conversion, some players are able to offer an output carrying encrypted streams of DSD, either via IEEE 1394 or more commonly, HDMI.\nSACD players are not permitted to offer an output carrying an unencrypted stream of DSD.\nThe first two generations of Sony's PlayStation 3 game console were capable of reading SACD discs. Starting with the third generation (introduced October 2007), SACD playback was removed. All PlayStation 3 models, however, will play DSD Disc format. The PlayStation 3 was capable of converting multi-channel DSD to lossy 1.5\u00a0Mbit/s DTS for playback over S/PDIF using the 2.00 system software. The subsequent revision removed the feature.\nSeveral brands have introduced (mostly high-end) Blu-ray Disc and Ultra HD Blu-ray players that can play SACD discs.\nUnofficial playback of SACD disc images on a PC is possible through freeware audio player foobar2000 for Windows using the open source plug-in extension SACDDecoder. macOS music software Audirvana also supports playback of SACD disc images."}

The main types of toruses include ring toruses, horn toruses, and spindle toruses. A ring torus is sometimes colloquially referred to as a donut or doughnut.\nIf the axis of revolution does not touch the circle, the surface has a ring shape and is called a torus of revolution, also known as a ring torus. If the axis of revolution is tangent to the circle, the surface is a horn torus. If the axis of revolution passes twice through the circle, the surface is a spindle torus (or \"self-crossing torus\" or \"self-intersecting torus\"). If the axis of revolution passes through the center of the circle, the surface is a degenerate torus, a double-covered sphere. If the revolved curve is not a circle, the surface is called a \"toroid\", as in a square toroid.\nReal-world objects that approximate a torus of revolution include swim rings, inner tubes and ringette rings. \nA torus is different than a \"solid torus\", which is formed by rotating a disk, rather than a circle, around an axis. A solid torus is a torus plus the volume inside the torus. Real-world objects that approximate a \"solid torus\" include O-rings, non-inflatable lifebuoys, ring doughnuts, and bagels.\nIn topology, a ring torus is homeomorphic to the Cartesian product of two circles: \"S\"1 \u00d7 \"S\"1, which is sometimes used as the definition. It is a compact 2-manifold of genus 1. The ring torus is one way to embed this space into Euclidean space, but another way to do this is the Cartesian product of the embedding of \"S\"1 in the plane with itself. This produces a geometric object called the Clifford torus, a surface in 4-space.\nIn the field of topology, a torus is any topological space that is homeomorphic to a torus. The surface of a coffee cup and a doughnut are both topological tori with genus one.\nAn example of a torus can be constructed by taking a rectangular strip of flexible material such as rubber, and joining the top edge to the bottom edge, and the left edge to the right edge, without any half-twists (compare Klein bottle).\nEtymology.\n\"Torus\" is a Latin word denoting something round, a swelling, an elevation, a protuberance.\nGeometry.\nA torus of revolution in 3-space can be parametrized as:\nformula_1\nusing angular coordinates \"\u03b8\", \"\u03c6\" \u2208 [0, 2\u03c0), representing rotation around the tube and rotation around the torus's axis of revolution, respectively, where the \"major radius\" \"R\" is the distance from the center of the tube to the center of the torus and the \"minor radius\" \"r\" is the radius of the tube.\nThe ratio \"R\"/\"r\" is called the \"aspect ratio\" of the torus. The typical doughnut confectionery has an aspect ratio of about 3 to 2.\nAn implicit equation in Cartesian coordinates for a torus radially symmetric about the z-axis is\nformula_2\nAlgebraically eliminating the square root gives a quartic equation,\nformula_3\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Stack/styles.css\"/&gt;\nThe three classes of standard tori correspond to the three possible aspect ratios between R and r:\nWhen \"R\" \u2265 \"r\", the interior\nformula_4\nof this torus is diffeomorphic (and, hence, homeomorphic) to a product of a Euclidean open disk and a circle. The volume of this solid torus and the surface area of its torus are easily computed using Pappus's centroid theorem, giving:\nformula_5\nThese formulae are the same as for a cylinder of length 2\u03c0\"R\" and radius r, obtained from cutting the tube along the plane of a small circle, and unrolling it by straightening out (rectifying) the line running around the center of the tube. The losses in surface area and volume on the inner side of the tube exactly cancel out the gains on the outer side.\nExpressing the surface area and the volume by the distance p of an outermost point on the surface of the torus to the center, and the distance q of an innermost point to the center (so that \"R\" = and \"r\" =), yields\nformula_6\nAs a torus is the product of two circles, a modified version of the spherical coordinate system is sometimes used.\nIn traditional spherical coordinates there are three measures, R, the distance from the center of the coordinate system, and \u03b8 and \u03c6, angles measured from the center point.\nAs a torus has, effectively, two center points, the centerpoints of the angles are moved; \u03c6 measures the same angle as it does in the spherical system, but is known as the \"toroidal\" direction. The center point of \u03b8 is moved to the center of r, and is known as the \"poloidal\" direction. These terms were first used in a discussion of the Earth's magnetic field, where \"poloidal\" was used to denote \"the direction toward the poles\".\nIn modern use, toroidal and poloidal are more commonly used to discuss magnetic confinement fusion devices.\nTopology.\nTopologically, a torus is a closed surface defined as the product of two circles: \"S\"1 \u00d7 \"S\"1. This can be viewed as lying in C2 and is a subset of the 3-sphere \"S\"3 of radius \u221a2. This topological torus is also often called the Clifford torus. In fact, \"S\"3 is filled out by a family of nested tori in this manner (with two degenerate circles), a fact that is important in the study of \"S\"3 as a fiber bundle over \"S\"2 (the Hopf bundle).\nThe surface described above, given the relative topology from R3, is homeomorphic to a topological torus as long as it does not intersect its own axis. A particular homeomorphism is given by stereographically projecting the topological torus into R3 from the north pole of \"S\"3.\nThe torus can also be described as a quotient of the Cartesian plane under the identifications\n formula_7\nor, equivalently, as the quotient of the unit square by pasting the opposite edges together, described as a fundamental polygon \"ABA\"\u22121\"B\"\u22121.\nThe fundamental group of the torus is just the direct product of the fundamental group of the circle with itself:\n formula_8\nIntuitively speaking, this means that a closed path that circles the torus's \"hole\" (say, a circle that traces out a particular latitude) and then circles the torus's \"body\" (say, a circle that traces out a particular longitude) can be deformed to a path that circles the body and then the hole. So, strictly 'latitudinal' and strictly 'longitudinal' paths commute. An equivalent statement may be imagined as two shoelaces passing through each other, then unwinding, then rewinding.\nThe fundamental group can also be derived from taking the torus as the quotient formula_9 (see below), so that formula_10 may be taken as its universal cover, with deck transformation group formula_11. \nIts higher homotopy groups are all trivial, since a universal cover projection formula_12 always induces isomorphisms between the groups formula_13 and formula_14 for formula_15, and formula_10 is contractible.\nThe torus has homology groups:\nformula_17\nThus, the first homology group of the torus is isomorphic to its fundamental group-- which in particular can be deduced from Hurewicz theorem since formula_18 is abelian.\nThe cohomology groups with integer coefficients are isomorphic to the homology ones-- which can be seen either by direct computation, the universal coefficient theorem or even Poincar\u00e9 duality.\nIf a torus is punctured and turned inside out then another torus results, with lines of latitude and longitude interchanged. This is equivalent to building a torus from a cylinder, by joining the circular ends together, in two ways: around the outside like joining two ends of a garden hose, or through the inside like rolling a sock (with the toe cut off). Additionally, if the cylinder was made by gluing two opposite sides of a rectangle together, choosing the other two sides instead will cause the same reversal of orientation.\nTwo-sheeted cover.\nThe 2-torus is a twofold branched cover of the 2-sphere, with four ramification points. Every conformal structure on the 2-torus can be represented as such a two-sheeted cover of the 2-sphere. The points on the torus corresponding to the ramification points are the Weierstrass points. In fact, the conformal type of the torus is determined by the cross-ratio of the four points.\n\"n\"-dimensional torus.\nThe torus has a generalization to higher dimensions, the , often called the or hypertorus for short. (This is the more typical meaning of the term \"\"n\"-torus\", the other referring to \"n\" holes or of genus \"n\".) Just as the ordinary torus is topologically the product space of two circles, the \"n\"-dimensional torus is \"topologically equivalent to\" the product of \"n\" circles. That is:\n formula_19\nThe standard 1-torus is just the circle: \"T\"1 = \"S\"1. The torus discussed above is the standard 2-torus, \"T\"2. And similar to the 2-torus, the \"n\"-torus, \"T\"\"n\" can be described as a quotient of R\"n\" under integral shifts in any coordinate. That is, the \"n\"-torus is R\"n\" modulo the action of the integer lattice Z\"n\" (with the action being taken as vector addition). Equivalently, the \"n\"-torus is obtained from the \"n\"-dimensional hypercube by gluing the opposite faces together.\nAn \"n\"-torus in this sense is an example of an \"n-\"dimensional compact manifold. It is also an example of a compact abelian Lie group. This follows from the fact that the unit circle is a compact abelian Lie group (when identified with the unit complex numbers with multiplication). Group multiplication on the torus is then defined by coordinate-wise multiplication.\nToroidal groups play an important part in the theory of compact Lie groups. This is due in part to the fact that in any compact Lie group \"G\" one can always find a maximal torus; that is, a closed subgroup which is a torus of the largest possible dimension. Such maximal tori \"T\" have a controlling role to play in theory of connected \"G\". Toroidal groups are examples of protori, which (like tori) are compact connected abelian groups, which are not required to be manifolds.\nAutomorphisms of \"T\" are easily constructed from automorphisms of the lattice Z\"n\", which are classified by invertible integral matrices of size \"n\" with an integral inverse; these are just the integral matrices with determinant \u00b11. Making them act on R\"n\" in the usual way, one has the typical \"toral automorphism\" on the quotient.\nThe fundamental group of an \"n\"-torus is a free abelian group of rank\u00a0\"n\". The \"k\"th homology group of an \"n\"-torus is a free abelian group of rank \"n\" choose\u00a0\"k\". It follows that the Euler characteristic of the \"n\"-torus is 0 for all\u00a0\"n\". The cohomology ring \"H\"\u2022(formula_20,\u00a0Z) can be identified with the exterior algebra over the Z-module Z\"n\" whose generators are the duals of the \"n\" nontrivial cycles.\nConfiguration space.\nAs the \"n\"-torus is the \"n\"-fold product of the circle, the \"n\"-torus is the configuration space of \"n\" ordered, not necessarily distinct points on the circle. Symbolically, \"T\"\"n\" = (\"S\"1)\"n\". The configuration space of \"unordered\", not necessarily distinct points is accordingly the orbifold \"T\"\"n\" / \"S\"\"n\", which is the quotient of the torus by the symmetric group on \"n\" letters (by permuting the coordinates).\nFor \"n\" = 2, the quotient is the M\u00f6bius strip, the edge corresponding to the orbifold points where the two coordinates coincide. For \"n\" = 3 this quotient may be described as a solid torus with cross-section an equilateral triangle, with a twist; equivalently, as a triangular prism whose top and bottom faces are connected with a 1/3 twist (120\u00b0): the 3-dimensional interior corresponds to the points on the 3-torus where all 3 coordinates are distinct, the 2-dimensional face corresponds to points with 2 coordinates equal and the 3rd different, while the 1-dimensional edge corresponds to points with all 3 coordinates identical.\nThese orbifolds have found significant applications to music theory in the work of Dmitri Tymoczko and collaborators (Felipe Posada, Michael Kolinas, et al.), being used to model musical triads.\nFlat torus.\nA flat torus is a torus with the metric inherited from its representation as the quotient, R2 / L, where L is a discrete subgroup of R2 isomorphic to Z2. This gives the quotient the structure of a Riemannian manifold, as well as the structure of an abelian Lie group. Perhaps the simplest example of this is when L = Z2: R2 / Z2, which can also be described as the Cartesian plane under the identifications (\"x\", \"y\") ~ (\"x\" + 1, \"y\") ~ (\"x\", \"y\" + 1). This particular flat torus (and any uniformly scaled version of it) is known as the \"square\" flat torus.\nThis metric of the square flat torus can also be realised by specific embeddings of the familiar 2-torus into Euclidean 4-space or higher dimensions. Its surface has zero Gaussian curvature everywhere. It is flat in the same sense that the surface of a cylinder is flat. In 3 dimensions, one can bend a flat sheet of paper into a cylinder without stretching the paper, but this cylinder cannot be bent into a torus without stretching the paper (unless some regularity and differentiability conditions are given up, see below).\nA simple 4-dimensional Euclidean embedding of a rectangular flat torus (more general than the square one) is as follows:\n formula_21\nwhere \"R\" and \"P\" are positive constants determining the aspect ratio. It is diffeomorphic to a regular torus but not isometric. It can not be analytically embedded (smooth of class \"Ck\", 2 \u2264 \"k\" \u2264 \u221e) into Euclidean 3-space. Mapping it into \"3\"-space requires one to stretch it, in which case it looks like a regular torus. For example, in the following map:\n formula_22\nIf \"R\" and \"P\" in the above flat torus parametrization form a unit vector (\"R\", \"P\") = (cos(\"\u03b7\"), sin(\"\u03b7\")) then \"u\", \"v\", and 0 &lt; \"\u03b7\" &lt; \u03c0/2 parameterize the unit 3-sphere as Hopf coordinates. In particular, for certain very specific choices of a square flat torus in the 3-sphere \"S\"3, where \"\u03b7\" = \u03c0/4 above, the torus will partition the 3-sphere into two congruent solid tori subsets with the aforesaid flat torus surface as their common boundary. One example is the torus \"T\" defined by\n formula_23\nOther tori in \"S\"3 having this partitioning property include the square tori of the form \"Q\" \u22c5 \"T\", where \"Q\" is a rotation of 4-dimensional space R4, or in other words \"Q\" is a member of the Lie group SO(4).\nIt is known that there exists no \"C\"2 (twice continuously differentiable) embedding of a flat torus into 3-space. (The idea of the proof is to take a large sphere containing such a flat torus in its interior, and shrink the radius of the sphere until it just touches the torus for the first time. Such a point of contact must be a tangency. But that would imply that part of the torus, since it has zero curvature everywhere, must lie strictly outside the sphere, which is a contradiction.) On the other hand, according to the Nash-Kuiper theorem, which was proven in the 1950s, an isometric \"C\"1 embedding exists. This is solely an existence proof and does not provide explicit equations for such an embedding.\nIn April 2012, an explicit \"C\"1 (continuously differentiable) isometric embedding of a flat torus into 3-dimensional Euclidean space R3 was found. It is a flat torus in the sense that, as a metric space, it is isometric to a flat square torus. It is similar in structure to a fractal as it is constructed by repeatedly corrugating an ordinary torus at smaller scales. Like fractals, it has no defined Gaussian curvature. However, unlike fractals, it does have defined surface normals, yielding a so-called \"smooth fractal\". The key to obtaining the smoothness of this corrugated torus is to have the amplitudes of successive corrugations decreasing faster than their \"wavelengths\". (These infinitely recursive corrugations are used only for embedding into three dimensions; they are not an intrinsic feature of the flat torus.) This is the first time that any such embedding was defined by explicit equations or depicted by computer graphics.\nConformal classification of flat tori.\nIn the study of Riemann surfaces, one says that any two smooth compact geometric surfaces are \"conformally equivalent\" when there exists a smooth homeomorphism between them that is both angle-preserving and orientation-preserving. The Uniformization theorem guarantees that every Riemann surface is conformally equivalent to one that has constant Gaussian curvature. In the case of a torus, the constant curvature must be zero. Then one defines the \"moduli space\" of the torus to contain one point for each conformal equivalence class, with the appropriate topology. It turns out that this moduli space \"M\" may be identified with a punctured sphere that is smooth except for two points that have less angle than 2\u03c0 (radians) around them: One has total angle \u03c0 and the other has total angle 2\u03c0/3. \n\"M\" may be turned into a compact space \"M*\" \u2013 topologically equivalent to a sphere \u2013 by adding one additional point that represents the limiting case as a rectangular torus approaches an aspect ratio of 0 in the limit. The result is that this compactified moduli space is a sphere with \"three\" points each having less than 2\u03c0 total angle around them. (Such a point is termed a \"cusp\", and may be thought of as the vertex of a cone, also called a \"conepoint\".) This third conepoint will have zero total angle around it. Due to symmetry, \"M*\" may be constructed by glueing together two congruent geodesic triangles in the hyperbolic plane along their (identical) boundaries, where each triangle has angles of \u03c0/2, \u03c0/3, and 0. (The three angles of a hyperbolic triangle T determine T up to congruence.) As a result, the Gauss\u2013Bonnet theorem shows that the area of each triangle can be calculated as \u03c0 \u2212 (\u03c0/2 + \u03c0/3 + 0) = \u03c0/6, so it follows that the compactified moduli space \"M*\" has area equal to \u03c0/3.\nThe other two cusps occur at the points corresponding in \"M*\" to (a) the square torus (total angle \u03c0) and (b) the hexagonal torus (total angle 2\u03c0/3). These are the only conformal equivalence classes of flat tori that have any conformal automorphisms other than those generated by translations and negation.\nGenus \"g\" surface.\nIn the theory of surfaces there is a more general family of objects, the \"genus\" \"g\" surfaces. A genus \"g\" surface is the connected sum of \"g\" two-tori. (And so the torus itself is the surface of genus 1.) To form a connected sum of two surfaces, remove from each the interior of a disk and \"glue\" the surfaces together along the boundary circles. (That is, merge the two boundary circles so they become just one circle.) To form the connected sum of more than two surfaces, successively take the connected sum of two of them at a time until they are all connected. In this sense, a genus \"g\" surface resembles the surface of \"g\" doughnuts stuck together side by side, or a 2-sphere with \"g\" handles attached.\nAs examples, a genus zero surface (without boundary) is the two-sphere while a genus one surface (without boundary) is the ordinary torus. The surfaces of higher genus are sometimes called \"n\"-holed tori (or, rarely, \"n\"-fold tori). The terms double torus and triple torus are also occasionally used.\nThe classification theorem for surfaces states that every compact connected surface is topologically equivalent to either the sphere or the connect sum of some number of tori, disks, and real projective planes.\nToroidal polyhedra.\nPolyhedra with the topological type of a torus are called toroidal polyhedra, and have Euler characteristic \"V\" \u2212 \"E\" + \"F\" = 0. For any number of holes, the formula generalizes to \"V\" \u2212 \"E\" + \"F\" = 2 \u2212 2\"g\", where \"g\" is the topological genus.\nToroidal polyhedra have been used to show that the maximum number of colors to color a map on a torus is seven. The Szilassi polyhedron is one example of a toroidal polyhedron with this property.\nThe Szilassi polyhedron's dual, the Cs\u00e1sz\u00e1r polyhedron, is the only polyhedron other than the tetrahedron which has the property that every possible edge connecting two vertices is an edge of the polyhedron.\nThe term \"toroidal polyhedron\" is also used for higher-genus polyhedra and for immersions of toroidal polyhedra, although some authors only include those with genus 1.\nSelf-crossing toroidal polyhedra are determined by the topology of their abstract manifold. One subset of the self-crossing toroidal polyhedra are the crown polyhedra, which are the only toroidal polyhedra that are also noble.\nAutomorphisms.\nThe homeomorphism group (or the subgroup of diffeomorphisms) of the torus is studied in geometric topology. Its mapping class group (the connected components of the homeomorphism group) is surjective onto the group formula_24 of invertible integer matrices, which can be realized as linear maps on the universal covering space formula_25 that preserve the standard lattice formula_26 (this corresponds to integer coefficients) and thus descend to the quotient.\nAt the level of homotopy and homology, the mapping class group can be identified as the action on the first homology (or equivalently, first cohomology, or on the fundamental group, as these are all naturally isomorphic; also the first cohomology group generates the cohomology algebra:\n formula_27\nSince the torus is an Eilenberg\u2013MacLane space \"K\"(\"G\", 1), its homotopy equivalences, up to homotopy, can be identified with automorphisms of the fundamental group); all homotopy equivalences of the torus can be realized by homeomorphisms \u2013 every homotopy equivalence is homotopic to a homeomorphism.\nThus the short exact sequence of the mapping class group splits (an identification of the torus as the quotient of formula_25 gives a splitting, via the linear maps, as above):\n formula_29\nThe mapping class group of higher genus surfaces is much more complicated, and an area of active research.\nColoring a torus.\nThe torus's Heawood number is seven, meaning every graph that can be embedded on the torus has a chromatic number of at most seven. (Since the complete graph formula_30 can be embedded on the torus, and formula_31, the upper bound is tight.) Equivalently, in a torus divided into regions, it is always possible to color the regions using no more than seven colors so that no neighboring regions are the same color. (Contrast with the four color theorem for the plane.)\nde Bruijn torus.\nIn combinatorial mathematics, a \"de Bruijn torus\" is an array of symbols from an alphabet (often just 0 and 1) that contains every \"m\"-by-\"n\" matrix exactly once. It is a torus because the edges are considered wraparound for the purpose of finding matrices. Its name comes from the De Bruijn sequence, which can be considered a special case where \"n\" is\u00a01 (one dimension).\nCutting a torus.\nA solid torus of revolution can be cut by \"n\" (&gt; 0) planes into at most\n formula_32\nparts. (This assumes the pieces may not be rearranged but must remain in place for all cuts.)\nThe first 11 numbers of parts, for 0 \u2264 \"n\" \u2264 10 (including the case of \"n\" = 0, not covered by the above formulas), are as follows:\n 1, 2, 6, 13, 24, 40, 62, 91, 128, 174, 230, ... (sequence in the OEIS).\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is popular in many countries and is prepared in various forms as a sweet snack that can be homemade or purchased in bakeries, supermarkets, food stalls, and franchised specialty vendors.\nDoughnuts are usually deep fried from a flour dough, but other types of batters can also be used. Various toppings and flavors are used for different types, such as sugar, chocolate or maple glazing. Doughnuts may also include water, leavening, eggs, milk, sugar, oil, shortening, and natural or artificial flavors.\nThe two most common types are the ring doughnut and the filled doughnut, which is injected with fruit preserves (the jelly doughnut), cream, custard, or other sweet fillings. Small pieces of dough are sometimes cooked as doughnut holes. Once fried, doughnuts may be glazed with a sugar icing, spread with icing or chocolate, or topped with powdered sugar, cinnamon, sprinkles or fruit. Other shapes include balls, flattened spheres, twists, and other forms. Doughnut varieties are also divided into cake (including the old-fashioned) and yeast-risen doughnuts. Doughnuts are often accompanied by coffee or milk. \n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nHistory.\nEarly history.\nA recipe for a deep-fried dough ball was recorded by Cato the Elder in his \"De agri cultura\", using cheese, honey, and poppy seeds, called \"globi\". Similar types of fried dough recipes have either spread to, or originated, in other parts of Europe and the World.\nA 13th-century Arabic cookbook, written by Ibn Raz\u012bn al-Tuj\u012bb\u012b contains a recipe for a doughnut-like variant of sfenj, made by frying leavened semolina dough, the dough is meant to be shaped into a small ball, the recipe also calls for shaping the dough into a Ka'ak with a hole in the middle to test its proofing. This is done before frying the first batch and results in a shape reminiscent of a modern doughnut.\nThe cookbook \"K\u00fcchenmeisterei\" (\"Mastery of the Kitchen\"), published in Nuremberg in 1485, offers a recipe for \"Gef\u00fcllte Krapfen\", stuffed, fried dough cakes.\nThe Spanish and Portuguese churro is a choux pastry dough that would also be served in a ring-shape. The recipe may have been brought from, or introduced to China, in the 16th century.\nEngland and North America.\nDutch settlers brought \"olykoek\" (\"oil cake\") to New York (or New Amsterdam) in the early 18th century. These doughnuts closely resembled later ones but did not yet have their current ring shape.\nA recipe for fried dough \"nuts\" was published, in 1750 England, under the title \"How to make Hertfordshire Cakes, Nuts and Pincushions\", in \"The Country Housewife's Family Companion by William Ellis.\"\nA recipe labelled \"dow nuts\", again from Hertfordshire, was found in a book of recipes and domestic tips written around 1800, by the wife of Baron Thomas Dimsdale, the recipe being given to the dowager Baroness by an acquaintance who transcribed for her the cooking instructions for a \"dow nut\".\nThe first cookbook using the near conventional \"dough nuts\" spelling was possibly the 1803 edition of \"The Frugal Housewife: Or, Complete Woman Cook\", which included dough nuts in an appendix of American recipes.\nOne of the earliest mentions of \"dough-nut\" was in Washington Irving's 1809 book \"A History of New York, from the Beginning of the World to the End of the Dutch Dynasty\":\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Sometimes the table was graced with immense apple-pies, or saucers full of preserved peaches and pears; but it was always sure to boast of an enormous dish of balls of sweetened dough, fried in hog's fat, and called dough-nuts, or oly koeks: a delicious kind of cake, at present scarce known in this city, excepting in genuine Dutch families.\nThe name \"oly koeks\" was almost certainly related to the \"oliekoek\": a Dutch delicacy of \"sweetened cake fried in fat.\"\nEtymology.\n\"Dough nut\".\nOne of the earliest known literary usages of the term dates to an 1808 short story describing a spread of \"fire-cakes and dough-nuts\". Washington Irving described \"dough-nuts\", in his 1809 \"History of New York, as\" \"balls of sweetened dough, fried in hog's fat, and called dough-nuts, or\" olykoeks\".\" These \"nuts\" of fried dough might now be called doughnut holes. The word \"nut\" is here used in the earlier sense of \"small rounded cake or cookie\", also seen in ginger nut. \"Doughnut\" is the traditional spelling and still dominates even in the United States though \"donut\" is often used. At present, \"doughnut\" and the shortened form \"donut\" are both pervasive in American English.\n\"Donut\".\nThe first known printed use of \"donut\" was in \"Peck's Bad Boy and his Pa\" by George W. Peck, published in 1900, in which a character is quoted as saying, \"Pa said he guessed he hadn't got much appetite, and he would just drink a cup of coffee and eat a donut.\" According to author John T. Edge the alternative spelling \"donut\" was invented in the 1920s when the New York\u2013based Display Doughnut Machine Corporation abbreviated the word to make it more pronounceable by the foreigners they hoped would buy their automated doughnut making equipment. The donut spelling also showed up in a \"Los Angeles Times\" article dated August 10, 1929 in which Bailey Millard jokingly complains about the decline of spelling, and that he \"can't swallow the 'wel-dun donut' nor the ever so 'gud bred'\".\nThe interchangeability of the two spellings can be found in a series of \"National Donut Week\" articles in \"The New York Times\" that covered the 1939 World's Fair. In four articles beginning 9 October, two mention the \"donut\" spelling. Dunkin' Donuts, which was so-named in 1950, following its 1948 founding under the name Open Kettle (Quincy, Massachusetts), is the oldest surviving company to use the \"donut\" variation; other chains, such as the defunct Mayflower Doughnut Corporation (1931), did not use that spelling. According to the Oxford Dictionaries while \"doughnut\" is used internationally, the spelling \"donut\" is American, with Krispy Kreme being a notable exception. The spelling \"donut\" remained rare until the 1950s, and has since grown significantly in popularity.\nTypes.\nRings.\nHanson Gregory, an American, claimed to have invented the ring-shaped doughnut in 1847 aboard a lime-trading ship when he was 16 years old. Gregory was dissatisfied with the greasiness of doughnuts twisted into various shapes and with the raw center of regular doughnuts. He claimed to have punched a hole in the center of dough with the ship's tin pepper box, and to have later taught the technique to his mother. \"Smithsonian Magazine\" states that his mother, Elizabeth Gregory, \"made a deep-fried dough that cleverly used her son's spice cargo of nutmeg and cinnamon, along with lemon rind,\" and \"put hazelnuts or walnuts in the center, where the dough might not cook through\", and called the food 'doughnuts'.\nRing doughnuts may be formed by a number of methods, including joining the ends of a long, skinny piece of dough into a ring, or using a doughnut cutter, which simultaneously cuts the outside and inside shape, leaving a doughnut-shaped piece of dough and a doughnut hole (the dough removed from the center). This smaller piece of dough can be cooked and served as a \"doughnut hole\" or added back to the batch to make more doughnuts. A disk-shaped doughnut can also be stretched and pinched into a torus until the center breaks to form a hole. Alternatively, a doughnut depositor can be used to place a circle of liquid dough (batter) directly into the fryer.\nThere are two types of ring doughnuts, those made from a yeast-based dough for raised doughnuts, or those made from a special type of cake batter. Yeast-raised doughnuts contain about 25% oil by weight, whereas cake doughnuts' oil content is around 20%, but have extra fat included in the batter before frying. Cake doughnuts are fried for about 90 seconds at approximately , turning once. Yeast-raised doughnuts absorb more oil because they take longer to fry, about 150 seconds, at . Cake doughnuts typically weigh between , whereas yeast-raised doughnuts average and are generally larger, and taller (due to rising) when finished.\nDaniela Galarza, for \"Eater\", wrote that \"the now-standard doughnut's hole is still up for debate. Food writer Michael Krondl surmises that the shape came from recipes that called for the dough to be shaped like a jumble \u2013 a once common ring-shaped cookie. In \"Cuisine and Culture: A History of Food and People\", culinary historian Linda Civitello writes that the hole was invented because it allowed the doughnuts to cook faster. By 1870 doughnut cutters shaped in two concentric circles, one smaller than the other, began to appear in home-shopping catalogues\".\nTopping.\nAfter frying, ring doughnuts are often topped. Raised doughnuts are generally covered with a glaze (icing). Cake doughnuts can also be glazed, powdered with confectioner's sugar, or covered with cinnamon and granulated sugar. They are also often topped with cake frosting (top only) and sometimes sprinkled with coconut, chopped peanuts, or sprinkles.\nHoles.\nDoughnut holes are small, bite-sized doughnuts that were traditionally made from the dough taken from the center of ring doughnuts. Before long, doughnut sellers saw the opportunity to market \"holes\" as a novelty and many chains offer their own variety, some with their own brand names such as \"Munchkins\" from Dunkin' Donuts and \"Timbits\" from Tim Hortons.\nTraditionally, doughnut holes are made by frying the dough removed from the center portion of the doughnut. Consequently, they are considerably smaller than a standard doughnut and tend to be spherical. Similar to standard doughnuts, doughnut holes may be topped with confections, such as glaze or powdered sugar.\nOriginally, most varieties of doughnut holes were derivatives of their ring doughnut (yeast-based dough or cake batter) counterparts. However, doughnut holes can also be made by dropping a small ball of dough into hot oil from a specially shaped nozzle or cutter. This production method has allowed doughnut sellers to produce bite-sized versions of non-ring doughnuts, such as filled doughnuts, fritters and Dutchies.\nFilled.\nFilled doughnuts are flattened spheres injected with fruit preserves, cream, custard, or other sweet fillings, and often dipped into powdered sugar or topped off with frosting. Common varieties include the Boston cream, coconut, key lime, and jelly.\nOther shapes.\nOthers include the fritter and the Dutchie, which are usually glazed. These have been available on Tim Hortons' doughnut menu since the chain's inception in 1964, and a 1991 \"Toronto Star\" report found these two were the chain's most popular type of fried dough in Canada.\nThere are many other specialized doughnut shapes such as old-fashioned, bars or Long Johns (a rectangular shape), or twists. Other shapes include balls, flattened spheres, twists, and other forms. In the northeast United States, bars and twists are usually referred to as \"crullers\". Another is the beignet, a square-shaped doughnut covered with powdered sugar, commonly associated with New Orleans.\nRegional variations.\nAsia.\nCambodia.\n\"Nom kong\" (\u1793\u17c6\u1794\u17bb\u17d0\u1784\u1780\u1784\u17cb), the traditional Cambodian doughnut, is named after its shape \u2013 the word '\u1780\u1784\u17cb' (pronounced \"kong\" in Khmer) literally means \"wheel\", whilst \"nom\" ('\u1793\u17c6\u1794\u17bb\u17d0\u1784') is the general word for pastry or any kind of starchy food. A very inexpensive treat for everyday Cambodians, this sweet pastry consists of a jasmine rice flour dough moulded into a classic ring shape and then deep fried in fat, then drizzled with a palm sugar toffee and sprinkled with sesame seeds. The rice flour gives it a chewy texture that Cambodians are fond of. This childhood snack is what inspired Cambodian-American entrepreneur Ted Ngoy to build his doughnut empire, inspiring the film The Donut King.\nChina.\nA few sweet, doughnut-style pastries are regional in nature. Cantonese cuisine features an oval-shaped pastry called \"ng\u00e0uhleis\u014du\" (\u725b\u8137\u9165, lit. \"ox-tongue pastry\", due to its tongue-like shape).\nA spherical food called \"saa1 jung\" (\u6c99\u7fc1), which is also similar to a cream puff but denser with a doughnut-like texture and usually prepared with sugar sprinkled on top, is normally available in dim sum\nCantonese restaurants. An oilier Beijing variant of this called \u9ad8\u529b\u8c46\u6c99, \"gaoli dousha\", is filled with red bean paste; originally, it was made with egg white instead of dough. Many Chinese cultures make a chewy doughnut known as \"shuangbaotai\" (\u96d9\u5305\u80ce), which consists of two conjoined balls of dough.\nChinese restaurants in the United States sometimes serve small fried pastries similar to doughnut holes with condensed milk as a sauce.\nChinese cuisine features long, deep-fried doughnut sticks that are often quite oily, hence their name in Mandarin, \"y\u00f3uti\u00e1o\" (\u6cb9\u689d, \"oil strips\"); in Cantonese, this doughnut-style pastry is called \"y\u00e0uhjagw\u00e1i\" (\u6cb9\u70b8\u9b3c, \"ghosts fried in oil\"). These pastries are lightly salted and are often served with congee, a traditional rice porridge or soy milk for breakfast.\nIndia.\nIn India, an old-fashioned sweet called gulgula is made of sweetened, deep-fried flour balls. A leavening agent may or may not be used.\nThere are a couple of unrelated doughnut-shaped food items. A savory, fried, ring-shaped snack called a \"vada\" is often referred to as the Indian doughnut. The \"vada\" is made from \"dal\", lentil or potato flours rather than wheat flour. In North India, it is in the form of a bulging disc called \"dahi-vada\", and is soaked in curd, sprinkled with spices and sliced vegetables, and topped with a sweet and sour chutney. In South India, a vada is eaten with \"sambar\" and a coconut chutney.\nSweet pastries similar to old-fashioned doughnuts called \"badushahi\" and \"jalebi\" are also popular. \"Balushahi\", also called \"badushah\", is made from flour, deep fried in clarified butter, and dipped in sugar syrup. Unlike a doughnut, \"balushahi\" is dense. A \"balushahi\" is ring-shaped, but the well in the center does not go all the way through to form a hole typical of a doughnut. \"Jalebi\", which is typically pretzel-shaped, is made by deep frying batter in oil and soaking it in sugar syrup. A variant of \"jalebi\", called \"imarti\", is shaped with a small ring in the center around which a geometric pattern is arranged.\nAlong with these Indian variants, typical varieties of doughnuts are also available from U.S. chains such as Krispy Kreme and Dunkin' Donuts retail outlets, as well as local brands such as Mad Over Donuts and the Donut Baker.\nIndonesia.\nThe Indonesian, \"donat kentang\" is a potato doughnut, a ring-shaped fritter made from flour and mashed potatoes, coated in powder sugar or icing sugar.\nJapan.\nIn Japan, \"an-doughnut\" (\u3042\u3093\u30c9\u30fc\u30ca\u30c3\u30c4, \"bean paste doughnut\") is widely available at bakeries. \"An-doughnut\" are similar to the German \"Berliner\", but contain red azuki bean paste. Mister Donut is one of the most popular doughnut chains in Japan. Native to Okinawa is a spheroid pastry similar to doughnuts called \"sata andagi\". Mochi donuts are \"a cross between a traditional cake-like doughnut and chewy mochi dough similar to what's wrapped around ice cream\". This hybrid confection was originally popularized in Japan by Mister Donut before spreading to the United States via Hawaii. The Mister Donut style, also known as \"pon de ring\", uses tapioca flour and produces mochi donuts that are easy to pull apart. Another variation developed in the United States uses glutinous rice flour which produces a denser mochi donut akin to Hawaiian-style butter mochi. Mochi donuts made from glutinous rice flour \"typically contain half the amount of calories as the standard cake or yeast doughnut\".\nMalaysia.\n\"Kuih keria\" is a hole doughnut made from boiled sweet potato that is mashed. The sweet potato mash is shaped into rings and fried. The hot doughnut is then rolled in granulated sugar. The result is a doughnut with a sugar-crusted skin.\nNepal.\n\"Sel roti\" is a Nepali homemade, ring-shaped, rice doughnut prepared during Tihar, the widely celebrated Hindu festival in Nepal. A semiliquid dough is usually prepared by adding milk, water, sugar, butter, cardamom, and mashed banana to rice flour, which is often left to ferment for up to 24 hours. A \"sel roti\" is traditionally fried in \"ghee\".\nPakistan.\nDoughnuts are available at most bakeries across Pakistan. The Navaz Sharif variety, available mainly in the city of Karachi, is covered in chocolate and filled with cream, similar to a Boston cream. Doughnuts can readily be found at the many Dunkin' Donuts branches spread across Pakistan.\nPhilippines.\nLocal varieties of doughnuts sold by peddlers and street vendors throughout the Philippines are usually made of plain well-kneaded dough, deep-fried in refined coconut oil and sprinkled with refined (not powdered or confectioner's) sugar. Round versions of this doughnut are known as \"bu\u00f1uelos\" (also spelled \"bunwelos\", and sometimes confusingly known as \"bicho-bicho\"), similar to the doughnuts in Spain and former Spanish colonies. Indigenous versions of the doughnut also exist, like the \"cascaron\", which is prepared similarly, but uses ground glutinous rice and coconut milk in place of wheat flour and milk.\nOther native doughnut recipes include the \"shakoy\", \"kumukunsi\", and \"binangkal\". \"Shakoy\" or \"siyakoy\" from the Visayas islands (also known as \"lubid-lubid\" in the northern Philippines) uses a length of dough twisted into a distinctive rope-like shape before being fried. The preparation is almost exactly the same as doughnuts, though there are variants made from glutinous rice flour. The texture can range from soft and fluffy, to sticky and chewy, to hard and crunchy (in the latter case, they are known as \"pilipit\"). They are sprinkled with white sugar, but can also be topped with sesame seeds or caramelized sugar. \"Kumukunsi\" is a \"jalebi\"-like native doughnut from the Maguindanao people. It is made with rice flour, duck eggs, and sugar that is molded into rope-like strands and then fried in a loose spiral. It has the taste and consistency of a creamy pancake. \"Binangkal\" are simple fried dough balls covered in sesame seeds. Other fried dough desserts include the mesh-like \"lokot-lokot\", the fried rice cake \"panyalam\", and the banana fritter \"maruya\", among others.\nTaiwan.\nIn Taiwan, \"shu\u0101ngb\u0101ot\u0101i\" (\u96d9\u80de\u80ce, lit. \"twins\") is two pieces of dough wrapped together before frying.\nThailand.\nIn Thailand, a popular breakfast food is \"pa thong ko\", also known as Thai donuts, a version of the Chinese \"yiu ja guoy/youtiao\". Often sold from food stalls in markets or by the side of the road, these doughnuts are small, sometimes X-shaped, and sold by the bag full. They are often eaten in the morning with hot Thai tea.\nVietnam.\nVietnamese varieties of doughnuts include \"b\u00e1nh ti\u00eau\",\" b\u00e1nh cam\", and \"b\u00e1nh r\u00e1n\". \"B\u00e1nh ti\u00eau\" is a sesame-topped, deep-fried pastry that is hollow. It can be eaten alone or cut in half and served with \"b\u00e1nh b\u00f2\", a gelatinous cake, placed inside the pastry. \"B\u00e1nh cam\" is from Southern Vietnam and is a ball-shaped, deep-fried pastry coated entirely in sesame seeds and containing a mung bean paste filling. \"B\u00e1nh r\u00e1n\" is from Northern Vietnam and is similar to \"b\u00e1nh cam\"; however, the difference is that \"b\u00e1nh r\u00e1n \"is covered with a sugar glaze after being deep-fried and its mung bean paste filling includes a jasmine essence.\nEurope.\nArmenia.\nArmenia \u2013 \"Ponchik\" (, borrowed from the Russian word \u043f\u043e\u043d\u0447\u0438\u043a) is a deep-fried piece of dough shaped into a flattened sphere, that turns into a puffed-up sphere upon frying and then becomes a flattened sphere after it is opened. Ponchiks are filled with custard (plain, vanilla or chocolate mostly), while nowadays, they also get filled with Nutella, caramel and jam. In Armenian cuisine, ponchik has evolved from its possibly medieval Armenian (although under different name) and Soviet roots into a beloved street and caf\u00e9 dessert with a distinctly local character. While the Russian ponchik is often unfilled, or filled with jam and resembles a normal donut, the Armenian version is always filled with custard and puffy, collapsing after It is opened. \"Tutalik\" () is another Armenian doughnut-like dessert similar to doughnut holes, Armenian doughnuts are sometimes also referred to as \"chickies.\"\nAustria.\nIn Austria, doughnut equivalents are called \"Krapfen\". They are especially popular during Carnival season (Fasching), and do not have the typical ring shape, but instead are solid and usually filled with apricot jam (traditional) or vanilla cream (\"Vanillekrapfen\"). A second variant, called \"Bauernkrapfen\" are also made of yeast dough, and have a thick outside ring, but are very thin in the middle.\nBelgium.\nIn Belgium, the \"smoutebollen\" in Dutch, or \"croustillons\" in French, are similar to the Dutch kind of \"oliebollen\", but they usually do not contain any fruit, except for apple chunks sometimes. They are typical carnival and fair snacks and are coated with powdered sugar.\nCzech Republic.\nU.S.-style doughnuts are available in the Czech Republic, buit traditional ones have a solid shape and are filled with jelly (strawberry or apricot). The shape is similar to doughnuts in Germany or Poland. They are called \"Koblihy\" (\"Kobliha\" in singular). They may also be filled with nougat or with vanilla custard. There are now many fillings; halved or non-filled knots with sugar and cinnamon on top.\nDenmark.\nIn Denmark, U.S.-style doughnuts may be found at various stores, e.g. McDonald's and most gas stations. The Berliner, however, is also available in bakeries.\nFinland.\nin Finland, a sweet doughnut is called a \"munkki\" (the word also means \"monk\") and are commonly eaten in caf\u00e9s and cafeteria restaurants. It is sold cold and sometimes filled with jam (like U.S. jelly donuts) or a vanilla sauce. A ring doughnut is also known as \"donitsi\".\nA savory form of doughnut is the \"lihapiirakka\" (literally \"meat pie\"). Made from a doughnut mixture and deep fried, the end product is more akin to a savory doughnut than any pie known in the English-speaking world.\nFormer Yugoslavia.\nDoughnuts similar to the Berliner are prepared in the northern Balkans, particularly in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, North Macedonia and Serbia (\"pokladnice\" or \"krofne\"). They are also called \"krofna\", \"krafna\" or \"krafne\", a name derived from the Austrian \"Krapfen\" for this pastry. In Croatia, they are especially popular during Carneval season and do not have the typical ring shape, but instead are solid. Traditionally, they are filled with jam (apricot or plum). However, they can be filled with vanilla or chocolate cream. Other types of doughnuts are \"u\u0161tipci\" and \"fritule\". \nFrance.\nThe French \"beignet\", literally \"bump\", is the French and New Orleans equivalent of a doughnut: a pastry made from deep-fried choux pastry.\nGermany.\nIn parts of Germany, the doughnut equivalents are called \"Berliner\" (sg. and pl.), but not in the capital city of Berlin itself and neighboring areas, where they are called \"Pfannkuchen\" (which is often found misleading by people in the rest of Germany, who use the word \"Pfannkuchen\" to describe a pancake, which is also the literal translation of it). Both \"Berliner\" and \"Pfannkuchen\" are abbreviations of the term \"Berliner Pfannkuchen\", however.\nIn middle Germany, doughnuts are called \"Kreppel\" or \"Pfannkuchen\". In southern Germany, they are also called \"Krapfen\" and are especially popular during Carnival season (\"Karneval\"/\"Fasching\") in southern and middle Germany and on New Year's Eve in northern Germany. A \"Berliner\" does not have the typical ring shape of a doughnut, but instead is solid and usually filled with jam, while a ring-shaped variant called \"Kameruner\" is common in Berlin and eastern Germany. \"Bismarcks\" and \"Berlin doughnuts\" are also found in Australia, Canada, Denmark, Finland, Switzerland and the United States. Today, U.S.-style doughnuts are also available in Germany, but are less popular than their native counterparts.\nGreece.\nIn Greece, a doughnut-like snack called \"loukoumas (\u03bb\u03bf\u03c5\u03ba\u03bf\u03c5\u03bc\u03ac\u03c2)\", which is spherical and soaked in honey syrup, is available. It is often served with sprinkled cinnamon and grated walnuts or sesame seeds.\nHungary.\nF\u00e1nk is a sweet traditional Hungarian cake. The most commonly used ingredients are flour, yeast, butter, egg yolk, rum, salt, milk and oil for frying. The dough is allowed to rise for approximately 30 minutes, resulting in an extremely light pastry. \"F\u00e1nk\" is usually served with powdered sugar and lekvar.\nIt is supposed that \"F\u00e1nk\" pastry is of the same origin as German Berliner, Dutch \"oliebol\", and Polish \"p\u0105czki\".\nItaly.\nItalian doughnuts include \"ciambelle\", krapfen from Trentino-Alto Adige, \"zippuli\" or \"zeppole\" from Calabria and Campania, \"maritozzi\" from Latium, above all Rome, \"bomboloni\" from Tuscany, \"frittelle\" from Veneto and many others. In the island of Sardinia there is a particular donut, a ring cake called \"lorica\".\nLithuania.\nIn Lithuania, a kind of doughnut called \"spurgos\" is widely known. Some spurgos are similar to Polish p\u0105czki, but some specific recipes, such as cottage cheese doughnuts (\"var\u0161k\u0117s spurgos\"), were invented independently.\nNetherlands.\nIn the Netherlands, \"oliebollen\", referred to in cookbooks as \"Dutch doughnuts\", are a type of fritter, with or without raisins or currants, and usually sprinkled with powdered sugar. Variations of the recipe contain slices of apple or other fruits. They are traditionally eaten as part of New Year celebrations.\nNorway.\nIn Norway, smultring is the prevailing type of doughnut traditionally sold in bakeries, shops, and stalls. However, U.S.-style doughnuts are widely available in larger supermarkets, McDonald's restaurants, 7-elevens and bakeries. The Berliner is more common than U.S.-style doughnut, and sold in most supermarkets and bakeries alongside \"smultring\" doughnuts.\nPoland.\nIn Poland and parts of the U.S. with a large Polish community, like Chicago and Detroit, the round, jam-filled doughnuts eaten especially\u2014though not exclusively\u2014during Carnival are called p\u0105czki (). P\u0105czki have been known in Poland at least since the Middle Ages. J\u0119drzej Kitowicz has described that during the reign of the Augustus III under influence of French cooks who came to Poland at that time, p\u0105czki dough fried in Poland has been improved, so that p\u0105czki became lighter, spongier, and more resilient.\nPortugal.\nThe malasada is a common type of holeless donut created in Portugal. They are made of fried dough. In Madeira and the Azores they are eaten on Fat Tuesday. It is also popular in Hawaii and Cape Cod. The malasada arrived after immigrants came in.\nRomania.\nThe Romanian dessert \"gogo\u0219i\" are fried dough balls similar to filled doughnuts. They are stuffed with chocolate, jam, cheese and other combinations and may be dusted with icing sugar.\nRussia.\nIn Russia and the other Post-Soviet countries, \"ponchiki\" (, plural form of \u043f\u043e\u043d\u0447\u0438\u043a, \"ponchik\") or (, especially in St. Petersburg) are a very popular sweet doughnut, with many fast and simple recipes available in Russian cookbooks for making them at home as a breakfast or coffee pastry.\nSlovenia.\nIn Slovenia, a jam-filled doughnut known as \"krofi\", is very popular. It is the typical sweet during Carnival time, but is to be found in most bakeries during the whole year. The most famous \"krofi\" come from the village of Trojane in central Slovenia, and are originally filled with apricot jam filling.\nSpain.\nIn Spain, there are two different types of doughnuts. The first one, simply called \"d\u00f3nuts\", or more traditionally \"berlinas\", is a U.S.-style doughnut, i.e., a deep-fried, sweet, soft, ring of flour dough. The Spanish term \"berlinesas\" mainly refers to a type of pastry rather different from the classic doughnut (see ).\nThe second type of doughnut is a traditional pastry called \"rosquilla\" or \"rosquete\" (the latter name is typical in the Canary Islands), made of fermented dough and fried or baked in an oven. \"Rosquillas\" were purportedly introduced in Spain by the Romans. In Spain, there are several variants of them depending on the region where they are prepared and the time of the year they are sold. In some regions they are considered a special pastry prepared only for Easter. Although overall they are more tightly textured and less sweet than U.S.-style doughnuts, they differ greatly in shape, size and taste from one region to another.\nThe \"churro\" is a sweet pastry of deep-fried dough similar to a doughnut but shaped as a long, thin, ribbed cylinder rather than a ring or sphere. \"Churros\" are commonly served dusted in sugar as a snack or with a cup of hot chocolate.\nSwitzerland.\nIn Switzerland, there are \"Zigerkrapfen\", \"Berliner\" and \"tortelli di San Giuseppe\".\nSweden.\nSimilar to the Finnish \"munkki\", the Swedish \"munk\" is a sweet doughnut commonly eaten as \"fika\" along with coffee. It is sold cold and is sometimes filled with jam (U.S. jelly) or a vanilla sauce. A ring doughnut is also known as simply \"munk\".\nUkraine.\nIn Ukraine doughnuts are called \"pampushky\" (). \"Pampushky\" are made of yeast dough containing wheat, rye or buckwheat flour. Traditionally they are baked, but may also be fried. According to William Pokhlyobkin, the technology of making \"pampushky\" points to German cuisine, and these buns were possibly created by German colonists in Ukraine.\nUnited Kingdom.\nIn the United Kingdom, both filled and ring doughnuts are popular, with jam doughnuts and other varieties readily available at supermarkets. In some parts of Scotland, ring doughnuts are referred to as \"doughrings\", with the 'doughnut' name being reserved exclusively for the nut-shaped variety. Glazed, twisted rope-shaped doughnuts are known as \"yum-yums\". It is also possible to buy fudge doughnuts in certain regions of Scotland. Fillings include jam, custard, cream, sweet mincemeat, chocolate and apple. Common ring toppings are sprinkle-iced and chocolate.\nIn Northern Ireland, ring doughnuts are known as \"gravy rings\", \"gravy\" being an archaic term for hot cooking oil.\nNorth America.\nCaribbean region.\nA \"kurma\" is a small, sweet, fried cube-shaped or rectangular doughnut which originated in Eastern India but is sold in Trinidad and Tobago.\nCosta Rica.\nA traditional Puntarenas cream-filled doughnut is round and robust, managing to keep the cream inside liquified. They are popular in Costa Rica.\nMexico.\nThe Mexican \"donas\" are similar to doughnuts, including the name; the dona is a fried-dough pastry-based snack, commonly covered with powdered brown sugar and cinnamon, white sugar or chocolate.\nUnited States and Canada.\nFrosted, glazed, powdered, Boston cream, coconut, sour cream, cinnamon, chocolate, and jelly are some of the varieties eaten in the United States and Canada. There are also potato doughnuts (sometimes referred to as spudnuts).\nDoughnuts are ubiquitous in the United States and can be found in most grocery stores, as well as in specialty . They are equally popular in Canada. Canadians eat more doughnuts per capita than any other nation and has more doughnuts shops per capita than any other nation.\nA popular doughnut in Hawaii is the malassada. Malassadas were brought to the Hawaiian Islands by early Portuguese settlers, and are a variation on Portugal's filh\u00f3s. They are small, eggy balls of yeast dough deep-fried and coated in sugar.\nImmigrants have brought various doughnut varieties to the United States. To celebrate Fat Tuesday in eastern Pennsylvania, churches sell a potato starch doughnut called a Fastnacht (or Fasnacht). The treats are so popular there that Fat Tuesday is often called Fastnacht Day. The Polish doughnut, the p\u0105czki, is popular in U.S. cities with large Polish communities such as Chicago, Milwaukee, and Detroit.\nIn regions of the country where apples are widely grown, especially the Northeast and Midwest states, cider doughnuts are a harvest season specialty, especially at orchards open to tourists, where they can be served fresh. Cider doughnuts are a cake doughnut with apple cider in the batter. The use of cider affects both the texture and flavor, resulting in a denser, moister product. They are often coated with either granulated, powdered sugar, or cinnamon sugar.\nIn southern Louisiana, a popular variety of the doughnut is the beignet, a fried, square doughnut served traditionally with powdered sugar. Perhaps the most well-known purveyor of beignets is New Orleans restaurant Cafe Du Monde.\nIn Quebec, homemade doughnuts called \"beignes de No\u00ebl\" are traditional Christmas desserts.\nMiddle East and North Africa.\nIran.\nThe Persian \"zoolbia\" and \"bamiyeh\" are fritters of various shapes and sizes coated in a sugar syrup. Doughnuts are also made in the home in Iran, referred to as doughnut, even in the plural.\nIsrael.\nJelly doughnuts, known as \"sufganiyah\" (\u05e1\u05d5\u05e4\u05d2\u05e0\u05d9\u05d4, pl. sufganiyot \u05e1\u05d5\u05e4\u05d2\u05e0\u05d9\u05d5\u05ea) in Israel, have become a traditional Hanukkah food in the recent era, as they are cooked in oil, associated with the holiday account of the miracle of the oil. Traditional \"sufganiyot\" are filled with red jelly and topped with icing sugar. However, many other varieties exist, with some being filled with \"dulce de leche\" (particularly common after the South American aliyah early in the 21st century).\nMorocco.\nIn Morocco, \"Sfenj\" is a similar pastry eaten sprinkled with sugar or soaked in honey.\nTunisia.\nIn Tunisia, traditional pastries similar to doughnuts are \"yo-yos\". They come in different versions both as balls and in shape of doughnuts. They are deep-fried and covered in a honey syrup or a kind of frosting. Sesame seeds are also used for flavor and decoration along with orange juice and vanilla.\nOceania.\nAustralia.\nIn Australia, the doughnut is a popular snack food. Jam doughnuts are particularly popular, especially in Melbourne, Victoria and the Queen Victoria Market, where they are a tradition. Jam doughnuts are similar to a Berliner, but are served hot: red jam (raspberry or strawberry) is injected into the bun before it is deep-fried, and then it is coated with either sugar or sugar mixed with cinnamon as soon as it has been cooked. Jam doughnuts are sometimes also bought frozen. In South Australia, they are known as Berliner or Kitchener and often served in cafes. Popular variants include custard-filled doughnuts, and more recently Nutella-filled doughnuts.\nMobile vans that serve doughnuts, traditional or jam, are often seen at spectator events, markets, carnivals and fetes, and by the roadside near high-traffic areas like airports and the car parks of large shopping centres. Traditional cinnamon doughnuts are readily available in Australia from specialized retailers and convenience stores. Doughnuts are a popular choice for schools and other not-for-profit groups to cook and sell as a fundraiser.\nNew Zealand.\nIn New Zealand, the doughnut is a popular food snack available in corner dairies. They are in the form of a long sweet bread roll with a deep cut down its long axis. In this cut is placed a long dollop of sweetened clotted cream and on top of this is a spot of strawberry jam. Doughnuts are of two varieties: fresh cream or mock cream. The rounded variety is widely available as well.\nSouth America.\nBrazil.\nIn Brazil, bakeries, grocery stores and pastry shops sell ball-shaped doughnuts popularly known as \"sonhos\" (lit. dreams). The dessert was brought to Brazil by Portuguese colonizers that had contact with Dutch and German traders. They are the equivalent of nowadays \"bolas de Berlim\" (lit. balls of Berlin) in Portugal, but the traditional Portuguese yellow cream was substituted by local dairy and fruit products. They are made of a special type of bread filled with \"goiabada\" (guava jelly) or milk cream, and covered by white sugar.\nChile.\nThe \"Berlin\" (plural \"Berlines\") doughnut is popular in Chile because of the large German community. It may be filled with jam or with \"manjar\", the Chilean version of \"dulce de leche\".\nPeru.\nPeruvian cuisine includes picarones which are doughnut-shaped fritters made with a squash and sweet potato base. These snacks are almost always served with a drizzle of sweet molasses-based sauce.\nSub-Saharan Africa.\nSouth Africa.\nIn South Africa, an Afrikaans variation known as the \"koeksister\" is popular. Another variation, similar in name, is the Cape Malay \"koesister\" being soaked in a spiced syrup and coated in coconut. It has a texture similar to more traditional doughnuts as opposed to the Afrikaans variety. A further variation is the \"vetkoek\", which is also dough deep fried in oil. It is served with mince, syrup, honey or jam.\nIn popular culture.\nThe doughnut has made many appearances in popular culture, particularly in the United States and Australia. References extend to objects or actions that are doughnut-shaped.\nIn film, the doughnut has inspired \"Dora's Dunking Doughnuts\" (1933), \"The Doughnuts\" (1963) and . In video games, the doughnut has appeared in games like \"The Simpsons Game\" and \"Donut Dilemma\". In the cartoon \"\u00a1Mucha Lucha!\", there are four things that make up the code of mask wrestling: honor, family, tradition, and doughnuts. Also, in the television sitcom \"The Simpsons\", Homer Simpson's love affair with doughnuts is a prominent ongoing joke as well as the focal point of more than a few episodes. In the children's book \"Homer Price\", Homer's Uncle Ulysses installs a doughnut making machine in his lunchroom in the fictional town of Centerburg. There is also a children's book \"Arnie the Doughnut\" and music albums \"The Doughnut in Granny's Greenhouse\".\nIn films, TV shows, and other popular culture references, police officers are associated with doughnuts, depicted as enjoying them during their coffee break or office hours. This clich\u00e9 has been parodied in the film \"\", where Officer Zed is instructing new recruits how to \"properly\" consume their doughnuts with coffee. It is also parodied in the television series \"Twin Peaks\", where the police station is always in large supply. In the video game \"Neuromancer\", there is a \"Donut World\" shop, where only policemen are allowed. During a citywide \"lockdown\" after the Boston Marathon bombing, a handful of selected Dunkin' Donuts locations were ordered to remain open to serve police and first responders despite the closing of the vast majority of city businesses.\nIndustry by country.\nAustralia.\nDonut King is Australia's largest retailer of doughnuts. A Guinness Book of Records largest doughnut made up of 90,000 individual doughnuts was set in Sydney in 2007 as part of a celebration for the release of \"The Simpsons Movie\".\nCanada.\nPer capita, Canadians consume the most doughnuts, and Canada has the most doughnut stores per capita.\nUnited States.\nWithin the United States, the Providence metropolitan area was cited as having the most doughnut shops per capita (25.3 doughnut shops per 100,000 people) as of 13 January 2010. National Doughnut Day celebrates the doughnut's history and role in popular culture. There is a race in Staunton, Illinois, featuring doughnuts, called the Tour de Donut.\nPink boxes.\nIn the US, especially in Southern California, fresh doughnuts sold by the dozen at local doughnut shops are typically packaged in generic pink boxes. This phenomenon has been attributed to Ted Ngoy and Ning Yen, refugees of the Cambodian genocide who began to transform the local doughnut shop industry in 1976. They proved so adept at the business and in training fellow Chinese Cambodian refugees to follow suit that these local doughnut shops soon dominated native franchises such as Winchell's Donuts. Ngoy and Yen allegedly planned to purchase boxes of a lucky red color rather than the standard white, but settled on a leftover pink stock because of its lower cost.\nIn the mid-1970s, pink doughnut boxes were already a common sight in the eastern and midwestern United States, due to the fact that Dunkin' Donuts used a solid pink color for its boxes at that time. (It switched to a different box design sometime after 1975.) But the chain did not begin to establish a major presence in California until the 2010s.\nOwing to the success of Ngoy and Yen's business, the color soon became a recognizable standard in California. Due to the locality of Hollywood, the pink boxes frequently appeared as film and television props and were thus transmitted into popular culture.\nHolidays and festivals.\nNational Doughnut Day.\nNational Doughnut Day, also known as National Donut Day, celebrated in the United States of America, is on the first Friday of June each year, succeeding the Doughnut Day event created by The Salvation Army in 1938 to honor those of their members who served doughnuts to soldiers during World War I. About 250 Salvation Army volunteers went to France. Because of the difficulties of providing freshly baked goods from huts established in abandoned buildings near the front lines, the two Salvation Army volunteers (Ensign Margaret Sheldon and Adjutant Helen Purviance) came up with the idea of providing doughnuts. These are reported to have been an \"instant hit\", and \"soon many soldiers were visiting The Salvation Army huts\". Margaret Sheldon wrote of one busy day: \"Today I made 22 pies, 300 doughnuts, 700 cups of coffee.\"\nSoon, the women who did this work became known by the servicemen as \"Doughnut Dollies\".\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The franchise moved to Gwinnett County, Georgia, in 2009 to play in the newly built Coolray Field as the Gwinnett Braves.\nThe R-Braves came to Richmond in 1966 after the Braves' top affiliate, the Atlanta Crackers, moved to Virginia. The then-Milwaukee Braves had bought the Crackers as part of their planned move to Atlanta in 1965; under MLB rules of the day, they bought the Crackers in order to obtain the major league rights to Atlanta. However, an injunction forced the Braves to play a lame-duck season in Milwaukee in 1965, leaving them to operate the Crackers in Atlanta for one more season. When searching for a new home for the Crackers, they landed in Richmond, where Parker Field had been left open by the previous year's move of the Richmond Virginians, a New York Yankees affiliate that moved in 1965.\nAt the time of the R-Braves' departure to Gwinnett, only the Baltimore Orioles and their Appalachian League affiliate, the Bluefield Orioles, had held a longer affiliation agreement in a single city than Atlanta/Richmond's 43 seasons.

{"id": "74805", "revid": "10202399", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=74805", "title": "Mother Goose", "text": "Imaginary author of nursery rhymes and tales\nMother Goose is a character that originated in children's fiction, as the imaginary author of a collection of French fairy tales and later of English nursery rhymes. She also appeared in a song, the first stanza of which often functions now as a nursery rhyme. The character also appears in a pantomime tracing its roots to 1806.\nThe term's appearance in English dates back to the early 18th century, when Charles Perrault's fairy tale collection, \"Contes de ma M\u00e8re l'Oye\", was first translated into English as \"Tales of My Mother Goose\". Later a compilation of English nursery rhymes, titled \"Mother Goose's Melody, or, Sonnets for the Cradle\", helped perpetuate the name both in Britain and the United States.\nThe character.\nMother Goose's name was identified with English collections of stories and nursery rhymes popularised in the 17th century. English readers would already have been familiar with Mother Hubbard, a stock figure when Edmund Spenser published the satire \"Mother Hubberd's Tale\" in 1590, as well as with similar fairy tales told by \"Mother Bunch\" (the pseudonym of Madame d'Aulnoy) in the 1690s. An early mention appears in an aside in a versified French chronicle of weekly events, Jean Loret's \"La Muse Historique\", collected in 1650. His remark, \"comme un conte de la M\u00e8re Oye\" (\"like a Mother Goose story\") shows that the term was readily understood. Additional 17th-century Mother Goose/Mere l'Oye references appear in French literature in the 1620s and 1630s.\nSpeculation about origins.\nIn the 20th century, Katherine Elwes-Thomas theorised that the image and name \"Mother Goose\" or \"M\u00e8re l'Oye\" might be based upon ancient legends of the wife of King Robert II of France, known as \"Berthe la fileuse\" (\"Bertha the Spinner\") or \"Berthe pied d'oie\" (\"Goose-Footed Bertha\" ), often described as spinning incredible tales that enraptured children. Other scholars have pointed out that Charlemagne's mother, Bertrada of Laon, came to be known as the goose-foot queen (\"regina pede aucae\"). There are even sources that trace Mother Goose's origin back to the biblical Queen of Sheba. Stories of Bertha with a strange foot (goose, swan or otherwise) exist in many languages including Middle German, French, Latin and, Italian. Jacob Grimm theorised that these stories are related to the Upper German figure Perchta or Berchta (English Bertha). Like the legends of \"Bertha la fileuse\" in France and the story of Mother Goose Berchta was associated with children, geese, and spinning or weaving, although with much darker connotations. \nDespite evidence to the contrary, it has been stated in the United States that the original Mother Goose was the Bostonian wife of Isaac Goose, either named Elizabeth Foster Goose (1665\u20131758) or Mary Goose (d. 1690, age 42). She was reportedly the second wife of Isaac Goose (alternatively named Vergoose or Vertigoose), who brought to the marriage six children of her own to add to Isaac's ten. After Isaac died, Elizabeth went to live with her eldest daughter, who had married Thomas Fleet, a publisher who lived on Pudding Lane (now Devonshire Street). According to Early, \"Mother Goose\" used to sing songs and ditties to her grandchildren all day, and other children swarmed to hear them. Finally, it was said, her son-in-law gathered her jingles together and printed them. No evidence of such printing has been found, and historians believe this story was concocted by Fleet's great-grandson John Fleet Eliot in 1860. \nIona and Peter Opie, leading authorities on nursery lore, give no credence to either the Elwes-Thomas or the Boston suppositions. It is generally accepted that the term does not refer to any particular person.\nNursery tales and rhymes.\nCharles Perrault, one of the initiators of the literary fairy tale genre, published a collection of such tales in 1695 called \"Histoires ou contes du temps pass\u00e9s, avec des moralit\u00e9s\" under the name of his son, which became better known under its subtitle of \"Contes de ma m\u00e8re l'Oye\" or \"Tales of My Mother Goose\". Perrault's publication marks the first authenticated starting-point for Mother Goose stories. An English translation of Perrault's collection, Robert Samber's \"Histories or Tales of Past Times, Told by Mother Goose\", appeared in 1729 and was reprinted in America in 1786.\nNursery rhymes were once believed to have been published in John Newbery's compilation \"&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Visible anchor/styles.css\" /&gt;Mother Goose's Melody, or, Sonnets for the cradle\" published some time in London in the 1760s, but the first edition was probably published in 1780 or 1781 by Thomas Carnan, Newbery's stepson and successor. Although this edition was registered with the Stationers' Company in 1780, no copy has ever been confirmed, and the earliest surviving edition is dated 1784. The name \"Mother Goose\" has been associated in the English-speaking world with children's poetry ever since.\nPantomime.\nIn addition to being the purported author of nursery rhymes, Mother Goose is herself the title character in one\nrecorded by the Opies, only the first verse of which figures in later editions of their book. Titled \"Old Mother Goose and the Golden Egg\", this verse prefaced a 15-stanza poem that rambled through a variety of adventures involving not only the egg but also Mother Goose's son Jack. There exists an illustrated chapbook omitting their opening stanza that dates from the 1820s and another version was recorded by J. O. Halliwell in his \"The Nursery Rhymes of England\" (1842). Other shorter versions were also recorded later.\nAll of them, however, were dependent on a very successful pantomime first performed in London in 1806, and it is only by reference to its script that the unexplained gaps in the poem's narration are made clear. The pantomime, staged at Covent Garden during the Christmas season, was the work of Thomas John Dibdin and its title, \"Harlequin and Mother Goose, or The Golden Egg\", signals how it combines the \"Commedia dell'arte\" tradition and other folk elements with fable \u2013 in this case \"The Goose That Laid the Golden Eggs\". The stage version became a vehicle for the clown Joseph Grimaldi, who played the part of Avaro, but there was also a shorter script for shadow pantomime which allowed special effects of a different kind.\nSpecial effects were needed since the folk elements in the story made a witch-figure of Mother Goose. In reference to this, and especially the opening stanza, illustrations of Mother Goose began depicting her as an old lady with a strong chin who wears a tall pointed hat and flies astride a goose. Ryoji Tsurumi has commented on the folk aspects of this figure in his monograph on the play. In the first scene, the stage directions show her raising a storm and, for the first time onstage, flying a gander\u00a0\u2013 and she later raises a ghost in a macabre churchyard scene. These elements contrast with others from the harlequinade tradition in which the old miser Avaro transforms into Pantaloon, while the young lovers Colin and Colinette become Harlequin and Columbine.\nA new Mother Goose pantomime was written for the comedian Dan Leno by J. Hickory Wood and Arthur Collins for performances at Theatre Royal, Drury Lane in 1902. This had a different story line in which the poor but happy Mother Goose is tempted with wealth by the Devil. This was the ancestor of all the pantomimes of that title that followed, adaptations of which continue to appear. Playwright John J. McNally adapted the libretto by Wood and Collins for the 1903 Broadway musical \"Mother Goose\" which starred comedian Joseph Cawthorn in the title role. It used music by composer Frederick Solomon and lyrics by George V. Hobart.\nBecause nursery rhymes are usually referred to as Mother Goose songs in the US, however, children's entertainments in which a medley of nursery characters are introduced to sing their rhymes often introduced her name into American titles. Early 20th century examples of these include \"A dream of Mother Goose and other entertainments\" by J. C. Marchant and S. J. Mayhew (Boston, 1908); \"Miss Muffet Lost and Found : a Mother Goose play\" by Katharine C. Baker (Chicago, 1915); \"The Modern Mother Goose: a play in three acts\" by Helen Hamilton (Chicago, 1916); and the up-to-the-moment \"The Strike Mother Goose Settled\" by Evelyn Hoxie (Franklin Ohio and Denver Colorado, 1922).\nSculpture.\nIn the United States there is a granite statue of a flying Mother Goose by Frederick Roth at the entrance to Rumsey Playfield in New York's Central Park. Installed in 1938, it has several other nursery rhyme characters carved into its sides. On a smaller scale, there is Richard Henry Recchia's contemporary bronze rotating statue in the Rockport, Massachusetts, public library. There Mother Goose is depicted telling the tales associated with her to two small children, with twelve reliefs illustrating such stories about its round base.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He wrote more than 80 novels, plays, essays, poems, and philosophical reflections. Mulisch's works have been translated into 38 languages so far.\nAlong with Willem Frederik Hermans and Gerard Reve, Mulisch is considered one of the \"Great Three\" (\"De Grote Drie\") of Dutch postwar literature. His novel \"The Assault\" (1982) was adapted into a film that won both a Golden Globe and an Academy Award. Mulisch's work is also popular among the country's public: a 2007 poll of NRC Handelsblad readers voted his novel \"The Discovery of Heaven\" (1992) the greatest Dutch book ever written. He was regularly mentioned as a possible future Nobel laureate. He won the 2007 International Nonino Prize in Italy.\nLife.\nHarry Kurt Victor Mulisch was born on 29 July 1927 in Haarlem in the Netherlands. Mulisch's father was from Austria-Hungary and emigrated to the Netherlands after the First World War. During the German occupation in World War II his father worked for a German bank which also dealt with confiscated Jewish assets. His mother, Alice Schwarz, was Jewish. Mulisch and his mother escaped transportation to a concentration camp thanks to Mulisch's father's collaboration with the Nazis, but his maternal grandmother was killed in a gas chamber. Mulisch was raised largely by his parents' housemaid, Frieda Falk. Mulisch said of himself, he did not just write about World War II, he was WWII.\nMulisch lived in Amsterdam from 1958 until his death in 2010.\nMulisch had two daughters, his daughters Frieda and Anna, with his wife Sjoerdje Woudenberg, and a son, Menzo, from his relationship with Kitty Saal.\nDeath.\nMulisch died in 2010. His death occurred at his Amsterdam home and his family was with him at the time. Dutch prime minister Mark Rutte described his death as \"a loss for Dutch literature and the Netherlands\". Culture minister Halbe Zijlstra bemoaned the demise of the \"Big Three\" as Gerard Reve and Willem Frederik Hermans had already died. Marlise Simons of \"The New York Times\" said his \"gift for writing with clarity about moral and philosophical themes made him an enormously influential figure in the Netherlands and earned him recognition abroad\". \"The L Magazine\"'s Mark Ashe quoted the American editions of his novels by referring to him as \"Holland's Greatest Author\" and \"Holland's most important postwar writer\".\nWorks.\nMulisch gained international recognition with the film \"The Assault\" (1986), based on his book \"of the same title\" (1982). It received an Oscar and a Golden Globe for best foreign movie and has been translated into more than twenty languages.\nHis novel \"The Discovery of Heaven\" (1992) is considered his masterpiece and was voted \"the best Dutch-language book ever\" by Dutch readers in a 2007 newspaper poll. \"It is the book that shaped our generation; it made us love, even obsess, with reading\", said Peter-Paul Spanjaard, 32, a lawyer in Amsterdam at the time of Mulisch's death. It was filmed in 2001 as \"The Discovery of Heaven\" by Jeroen Krabb\u00e9, starring Stephen Fry.\nAmong the many awards he received for individual works and his total body of work, the most important is the Prijs der Nederlandse Letteren (\"Prize of Dutch Literature\", a lifetime achievement award) in 1995.\nThemes in his work.\nA frequent theme in his work is the Second World War. His father had worked for the Germans during the war and went to prison for three years afterwards. As the war spanned most of Mulisch's formative phase, it had a defining influence on his life and work. In 1963, he wrote a non-fiction work about the Eichmann case: \"Criminal Case 40/61\". Major works set against the backdrop of the Second World War are \"De Aanslag\" (The Assault), \"Het stenen bruidsbed\", and \"Siegfried\".\nMulisch often incorporated ancient legends or myths in his writings, drawing on Greek mythology (e.g. in \"De Elementen\"), Jewish mysticism (in \"De ontdekking van de Hemel\" and \"De Procedure\"), well known urban legends and politics \nMulisch was politically left-wing, once signing a book \"dedicated in admiration\" to Fidel Castro.\nIn 1984, he delivered the Huizinga Lecture in Leiden, the Netherlands, under the title \"Het Ene\" (\"The Unifying Principle\").\nHonours and awards.\nPlanetoid.\nMulisch was honoured with a planetoid in his name on 12 October 2006 (see 10251 Mulisch)\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n10 See also: \u201cAugustinus P.

It was separated from the Duchy of Bavaria in 976, and was the first newly created Imperial State after the original German stem duchies.\nCarinthia remained a State of the Holy Roman Empire until its dissolution in 1806, though from 1335 it was ruled within the Austrian dominions of the Habsburg dynasty. A constituent part of the Habsburg monarchy and of the Austrian Empire, it remained a Cisleithanian crown land of Austria-Hungary until 1918. By the 1920 Carinthian plebiscite in October 1920, the main area of the duchy formed the Austrian state of Carinthia.\nHistory.\nIn the seventh century the area was part of the Slavic principality of Carantania, which fell under the suzerainty of Duke Odilo of Bavaria in about 743. The Bavarian stem duchy was incorporated into the Carolingian Empire when Charlemagne deposed Odilo's son Duke Tassilo III in 788. In the 843 partition by the Treaty of Verdun, Carinthia became part of East Francia under King Louis the German. From 889 to 976 it was the Carinthian March of the renewed Bavarian duchy, though in 927 the local Count Berthold of the Luitpolding dynasty was vested with ducal rights by the German king Henry the Fowler. After Berthold became Duke of Bavaria in 938, both territories were ruled by him. Upon his death in 948 the Luitpoldings, though heirs of the royal Ottonian dynasty, were not able to retain their possessions, as King Otto I bought the loyalty of his younger brother Henry I with the Bavarian lands.\nEstablishment.\nDuke Henry's son Henry II \"the Quarreller\" from 974 onwards, revolted against his cousin Emperor Otto II, whereupon he was deposed as Duke of Bavaria in favour of Otto's nephew Duke Otto I of Swabia. At the same time Emperor Otto II created a sixth duchy in addition to the original stem duchies, the new Duchy of Carinthia. He reverted the possession of the territories to the Luitpoldings, when he split Carinthia from the Bavarian lands and installed the former Duke Berthold's son Henry the Younger as duke in 976.\nOver the centuries, the name 'Carinthia' (\"K\u00e4rnten\") gradually replaced former 'Carantania'. The realm of the Carinthian dukes initially comprised a vast territory including the marches of Styria (\"marchia Carantana\"), Carniola and Istria; they also ruled over the Italian March of Verona in the south. Nevertheless, Henry the Younger was the first and also the last Luitpolding duke; as he chose to join the unsuccessful War of the Three Henries against Emperor Otto II, he lost Carinthia two years later and was succeeded by the Emperor's nephew Otto I, a scion of the Salian dynasty. Though Henry once again managed to regain the ducal title in 985, Carinthia upon his death in 989 fell back to the Imperial Ottonian dynasty in Bavaria.\nEppensteins and Sponheims.\nCarinthia, however, remained a separate entity, and in 1012 Count Adalbero I of Eppenstein, Margrave of the Carinthian March (later Styria) since about 1000, was vested with the duchy by the last Ottonian emperor Henry II, while the Istrian march was separated and given to Count Poppo of Weimar. Adalbero was removed from office in 1035 after he had fallen out of favour with the Salian Emperor Conrad II. In 1039 Carinthia was inherited by Emperor Henry III himself, who split off the Carniolan march the following year and granted it to Margrave Poppo of Istria. In 1077, the duchy was given to Luitpold, again a member of the Eppensteiner family, which, however, became extinct with the death of Luitpold's younger brother Henry III of Carinthia in 1122. Upon his death the duchy was further reduced in area: a large part of the Eppenstein lands in what is today Upper Styria passed to Margrave Ottokar II of Styria.\nThe remainder of Carinthia passed from Duke Henry III to his godchild Henry from the House of Sponheim, who ruled as Henry IV, from 1122 to his early death the following year. The most outstanding of the Spanheim dukes was Bernhard, the first Carinthian duke who was actually described and honoured in documents as \"prince of the land\". The last Spanheim duke was Ulrich III; he signed an inheritance treaty with his brother Archbishop Philip of Spanheim of Salzburg, who, however, could not prevail against the Bohemian king Ottokar II P\u0159emysl. In spite of being supported by the Habsburg king Rudolf I of Germany, who defeated Ottokar II at the Battle on the Marchfeld in 1278, Philip never gained actual power. The duchy was seized by Rudolph and Philip died a year later in 1279.\nHabsburgs.\nRudolf, after being elected King of the Romans and defeating King Ottokar II, at first gave Carinthia to Count Meinhard II of Gorizia-Tyrol. In 1335, after the death of Henry, the last male of this line, Emperor Louis the Bavarian gave Carinthia and the southern part of the Tyrol as an imperial fief to the Habsburg family on 2 May in Linz. The Habsburgs would continue to rule Carinthia until 1918. As with the other component parts of the Habsburg monarchy, Carinthia remained a semi-autonomous state with its own constitutional structure for a long time. The Habsburgs divided up their territories within the family twice, according to the 1379 Treaty of Neuberg and again in 1564. Each time, the Duchy of Carinthia became part of Inner Austria and was ruled jointly with the adjacent duchies of Styria and Carniola.\nCarinthia saw five Turkish incursions into its territory between 1473 and 1483, with much plundering and killing at the hands of Ottoman cavalry. These raids led to the Carinthian Peasant Revolt of 1478, as peasants, left unprotected by the nobility, tried to defend themselves and formed a peasants' league to organize their own defense. The raids also prompted the construction of defensive structures like fortified churches and castles (tabor).\nEmpress Maria Theresa of Austria and her son Joseph II attempted to create a more unitary Habsburg state, and in 1804 Carinthia was integrated into the newly established Austrian Empire under Francis II/I. According to the 1809 Treaty of Sch\u00f6nbrunn, the Upper Carinthian territories around Villach formed part of the short-lived Napoleonic Illyrian Provinces; Carinthia as a whole remained a part of the Habsburg Kingdom of Illyria until its dissolution in 1849.\nIn 1867, the duchy became a crown land of Cisleithania, the western part of Austria-Hungary (see History of Austria).\nOver the centuries, the German language, which carried more prestige, expanded at the expense of Slovene, but the fact that in the 16th century the Estates of Carinthia could still point out that Carinthia was \"a Windic Archduchy\", i.e. a sovereign Slovene principality, shows that the Carinthian people were aware of their ancient and pre-German roots.\nWorld War I and Carinthian Plebiscite.\nDuring World War I, Carinthia experienced a relatively high number of war deaths: thirty-seven for every 1,000 inhabitants. This was higher than in most other German-speaking areas of Austria-Hungary (except German South Moravia).\nFollowing the end of the war and the dissolution of Austria-Hungary, the 1919 Treaty of Saint-Germain stipulated the Carinthian Canal Valley stretching from Tarvisio as far as Pontafel (187 square miles) go to Italy and that the Slovene-speaking areas of the Me\u017ea Valley, the Drava Valley area around Unterdrauburg, which was afterwards renamed Dravograd, and the Jezersko area (128 square miles of territory) be ceded to the new SHS State. The Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, however, was not satisfied with these parts of the former duchy and also occupied land north of the Karawanks mountain range, including the capital city of Klagenfurt. The Entente powers decided on a two-stage referendum, of which the first stage, the Carinthian Plebiscite was held on 10 October 1920 to determine the fate of Carinthia. The outcome in favour of Austria did not change the borders as decided upon in the Treaty of Saint-Germain.\nThe Austrian part of the former duchy today forms the federal state of Carinthia (), while the area that was ceded to Italy as a part of the claimed \"Julian March\" belongs to the autonomous region of Friuli\u2013Venezia Giulia. Most of the area awarded to Yugoslavia (cf. Slovenian Carinthia) now forms part of the larger Carinthia Statistical Region in Slovenia.\nArea and population.\nArea:\nPopulation (1910 Census):\nLinguistic composition.\nAccording to the last Austrian Imperial census of 1910, the Duchy of Carinthia was composed of the following linguistic communities:\nTotal: 396,228\nThe Austrian censuses did not count ethnic groups, nor the mother tongue, but the \"language of daily interaction\" ().\nReligious composition.\nTotal: 396,228\nDukes of Carinthia.\nVarious dynasties.\nLuitpoldings\nSalian dynasty\nLuitpoldings\nOttonian dynasty\nSalian dynasty\nHouse of Eppenstein\nSalian dynasty\nElder House of Welf\nEzzonids\nHouse of Z\u00e4hringen\nHouse of Eppenstein\nVarious dynasties.\nP\u0159emyslid dynasty\nHouse of Habsburg\nHouse of Habsburg.\nInner Austrian Habsburgs.\nCarinthia was unified with the rest of the Habsburg territories again in 1619.\nSee List of rulers of Austria\nNotes and references.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\nVal Canale/Canal Valley - region of Carinthia now part of Italy"}
{"id": "74818", "revid": "4497767", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=74818", "title": "Carantania", "text": "Early medieval Slavic principality\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Stack/styles.css\"/&gt;\nCarantania, also known as Carentania (, , in Old Slavic \"\"), was a Slavic principality that emerged in the second half of the 7th century, in the territory of present-day southern Austria and north-eastern Slovenia. Since the middle of the 8th century, it was allied with Bavaria against the Avars, and consequently became a vassal state of the Frankish Empire. In the same time, Christianisation of Carantanian Slavs was initiated, mainly through missionary activities of the Archdiocese of Salzburg. By 828, internal autonomy of the principality was abolished, and the entire Carantanian territory was gradually integrated into the East Frankish administrative system, based on counties and marches. Carantania thus became the predecessor of the March of Carinthia, created within the Carolingian Empire by 889.\nOrigin of the name.\nThe name \"Carantania\" is of proto-Slavic origin. Paul the Deacon mentions Slavs in \"Carnuntum, which is erroneously called Carantanum\" (\"Carnuntum, quod corrupte vocitant Carantanum\").\nA possible etymological explanation is that it may have been formed from a toponymic base \"carant-\" which ultimately derives from pre-Indo-European root *\"karra\" meaning 'rock', or that it is of Celtic origin and derived from *\"karant-\" meaning 'friend, ally'. Its Slavic name \"\" was adopted from the Latin *\"carantanum\". The toponym \"Carinthia\" (Slovene: &lt; Proto-Slavic \"*kor\u01ebt\u2019\u044csko\") is also claimed to be etymologically related, deriving from pre-Slavic *\"carantia\". In Slovene, \"Korotan\" remained a synonym for both Carinthia and Carantania well into the 19th and early 20th century. Nowadays, \"Karantanija\" is used for the early medieval Slavic principality, while \"Koro\u0161ka\" for the duchy and region that emerged from it from the 10th century onward.\nThe name, like most toponyms beginning with *\"Kar(n)-\" in this area of Europe, are in turn most likely linked to the pre-Roman tribe of the Carni that once populated the eastern Alps.\nTerritory.\nCarantania's capital was most likely Karnburg () in the Zollfeld Field (), north of modern-day town of Klagenfurt (). The principality was centered in the area of modern Carinthia, and included territories of modern Styria, most of today's East Tyrol and of the Puster Valley, the Lungau and Ennspongau regions of Salzburg, and parts of southern Upper Austria and Lower Austria. It most probably also included the territory of the modern Slovenian province of Carinthia. The few existing historical sources distinguish between two separate Slavic principalities in the Eastern Alpine area: Carantania and Carniola. The latter, which appears in historical records dating from the late 8th century, was situated in the central part of modern Slovenia. It was (at least by name) the predecessor of the later Duchy of Carniola.\nThe borders of the later Carantania state, which was under the feudal overlordship of the Carolingians, and its successor (the March of Carinthia, 826\u2013976), as well as of the later Duchy of Carinthia (from 976), extended beyond historical Carantania.\nHistory.\nIn the 4th century Chur became the seat of the first Christian bishopric north to the Alps. Despite a legend assigning its foundation to an alleged Briton king, St. Lucius, the first known bishop is one Asinio in AD 451.\nIn the aftermath of the Gothic War (535-554), the Byzantine Empire found itself unable to prevent the Germanic tribe of the Lombards from invading Italy and founding a kingdom there. The territory left behind by the Lombards in Pannonia was subsequently settled by Slavs (with the help of their Avar overlords) in the last decades of the 6th century. In 588 they reached the area of the Upper Sava River and in 591 they arrived in the Upper Drava region, where they soon fought the Bavarians under Duke Tassilo I. In 592 the Bavarians won, but three years later in 595 the Slavic-Avar army gained victory and thus consolidated the boundary between the Frankish and the Avar territories. By that time, today's East Tyrol and Carinthia came to be referred to in historical sources as \"Provincia Sclaborum\" (the Country of Slavs).\nIn the 6th century Chur was also conquered by the Franks.\nBetween the 9th and 10th centuries, the Alpine Slavs, who are reckoned to be among the ancestors of present-day Slovenes, settled the eastern areas of the Friuli region. They settled in the easternmost mountainous areas of Friuli, known as the Friulian Slavia, as well as the Karst Plateau and the area north and south from Gorizia. \nSlavic settlement in the Eastern Alps region is assumed to be connected to the collapse of local dioceses in the late 6th century, a change in population and material culture, and most importantly, in the establishment of a Slavic language group in the area. The territory settled by Slavs, however, was also inhabited by the remains of the indigenous Romanized population, which preserved Christianity.\nSlavs in both the Eastern Alps and the Pannonian region are assumed to be originally subject to Avar rulers (\"kagans\"). After Avar rule weakened around 610, a relatively independent March of the Slavs (\"marca Vinedorum\"), governed by a duke, emerged in southern Carinthia in the early 7th century. Historical sources mention Valuk as the duke of Slavs (\"Wallux dux Winedorum\").\nThe year 626 brought an end to Avar dominance over Slavs, as the Avars were defeated at Constantinople. In 658 Samo died and his Tribal Union disintegrated. A smaller part of the original March of the Slavs, centred north of modern Klagenfurt, preserved independence and came to be known as \"Carantania\". The name \"Carantania\" itself begins to appear in historical sources soon after 660. The first clear indication of a specific ethnic identity and political organisation may be recognised in the geographical term \"Carantanum\" which Paul the Deacon used in reference to the year 664, and in connection to which he also mentioned a specific Slavic people (\"gens Sclavorum\") living there.\nWhen about 740 Prince Boruth asked the Bavarian duke Odilo for help against the pressing danger posed by Avar tribes from the east, Carantania lost its independence. Boruth's successors had to accept the overlordship of Bavaria and the semifeudal Frankish kingdom, ruled by Charlemagne from 771 to 814. Charlemagne also put an end to the invasions undertaken by the Avars, who had regained eastern parts of Carantania between 745 and 795.\nIn 828, Carantania finally became a margraviate of the Carolingian Empire. The local princes were deposed for following the anti-Frankish rebellion of Ljudevit Posavski, the prince of Slavs of Lower Pannonia, and replaced by a Germanic (primarily Bavarian) ascendancy. By the 843 Treaty of Verdun, it passed into the hands of Louis the German (804\u2013876) who, according to the \"Annales Fuldenses\" (863), gave the title of a \"prefect of the Carantanians\" (\"praelatus Carantanis\") to his eldest son Carloman. In 887 Arnulf of Carinthia (850\u2013899), a grandson of Louis the German, assumed his title of King of the East Franks and became the first Duke of Carinthia.\nThe city of Chur suffered several invasions by the Magyars in 925-926, when the cathedral was destroyed.\nIn the area of Carantania 954\u2013979 exist Slavic parish \"pagus Crouuati\"(Croats) which is mentioned in royal charters, ruled by count Hartwig in the name of the German king.\nThe Ducal Inauguration.\nThe principality of Carantania is particularly notable for the ancient ritual of installing Carantanian dukes (or princes, both an approximate translation of Knez/Knyaz/F\u00fcrst), a practice that continued after Carantania was incorporated into the later Duchy of Carinthia. It was last performed in 1414, when the Habsburg Ernest the Iron was enthroned as Duke of Carinthia. The ritual took place on the Prince's Stone (Slovene \"Kne\u017eji kamen\", German \"F\u00fcrstenstein\"), an ancient Roman column capital near \"Krnski grad\" (now Karnburg) and was performed in Slovene by a free peasant who, selected by his peers, in the name of the people of the land questioned the new Prince about his integrity and reminded him of his duties. Later, when the Duchy of Carinthia had fallen to the Habsburgs, the idea that it was actually the people from whom the Duke of Carinthia received his legitimation was the basis of the Habsburgs' claim to the unique title of Archduke.\nThe coronation of Carinthian Dukes consisted of three parts: first, a ritual in Slovene was performed at the Prince's Stone; then a mass was held at the cathedral of Maria Saal (); and subsequently, a ceremony took place at the \"Duke's Chair\" (, German: ), where the new Duke swore an oath in German and where he also received the homage of the estates. The Duke's Chair is located at \"Zollfeld\" valley, north of Klagenfurt in modern Carinthia, Austria.\nThe ceremony was first described by the chronicler John of Viktring on the occasion of the coronation of Meinhard II of Tyrol in 1286. It is also mentioned in Jean Bodin's book \"Six livres de la R\u00e9publique\" in 1576.\nMentions in late medieval literature.\nChronicle of Fredegar mentions Carantania as \"Sclauvinia\", Dante Alighieri (1265\u20131321) mentions Carantania as \"Chiarentana\". The same name was also used by Florentines, such as the poet Fazio degli Uberti (circa 1309\u20131367), the famous chronicler Giovanni Villani (c. 1275\u20131348), and Giovanni Boccaccio (1313\u20131375), who wrote that the Brenta River rises from the mountains of Carantania, a land in the Alps dividing Italy from Germany.\nEthnic and social structure.\nThe population of ancient Carantania had a polyethnic structure. The core stratum was represented by two groups of Slavs who had settled in the Eastern Alps region in 6th century and are the ancestors of the present-day Slovenes and partially also Austrians. Other ethnic strong element included the descendants of the Romanised aboriginal peoples (Noricans), which is attestable on the basis of a recent DNA analysis and a number of place names. It is also possible that traces of Dulebes, Avars, Bulgars, Croats and the Germanic peoples were present among Carantanians.\nLanguage.\nIn its early stages, the language of Carantanian Slavs was essentially Proto-Slavic. In Slovenian linguistic literature and reference books it is sometimes provisionally termed \"Alpine Slavic\" (\"alpska slovan\u0161\u010dina\"). Its Proto-Slavic character can be deduced from language contacts of Alpine Slavs with the remainders of the Romanised aboriginal population, later also with Bavarians. The adopted Pre-Slavic placenames and river names and their subsequent phonetic development in Alpine Slavic, as well as Bavarian records of Alpine Slavic names, shed light on the characteristics of the Alpine Slavic language.\nFrom the 9th century onwards, Alpine Slavic underwent a series of gradual changes and innovations which were characteristic of South Slavic languages. By roughly the 13th century, these developments gave rise to the Slovene language.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "74819", "revid": "48572021", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=74819", "title": "Pupil", "text": "Part of an eye\nThe pupil is a hole located in the center of the iris of the eye that allows light to strike the retina. It appears black because light rays entering the pupil are either absorbed by the tissues inside the eye directly, or absorbed after diffuse reflections within the eye that mostly miss exiting the narrow pupil. The size of the pupil is controlled by the iris, and varies depending on many factors, the most significant being the amount of light in the environment. The term \"pupil\" was coined by Gerard of Cremona.\nIn humans, the pupil is circular, but its shape varies between species; some cats, reptiles, and foxes have vertical slit pupils, goats and sheep have horizontally oriented pupils, and some catfish have annular types. In optical terms, the anatomical pupil is the eye's aperture and the iris is the aperture stop. The image of the pupil as seen from outside the eye is the entrance pupil, which does not exactly correspond to the location and size of the physical pupil because it is magnified by the cornea. On the inner edge lies a prominent structure, the collarette, marking the junction of the embryonic pupillary membrane covering the embryonic pupil.\nFunction.\nThe iris is a contractile structure, consisting mainly of smooth muscle, surrounding the pupil. Light enters the eye through the pupil, and the iris regulates the amount of light by controlling the size of the pupil. This is known as the pupillary light reflex.\nThe iris contains two groups of smooth muscles; a circular group called the sphincter pupillae, and a radial group called the dilator pupillae. When the sphincter pupillae contract, the iris decreases or constricts the size of the pupil. The dilator pupillae, innervated by sympathetic nerves from the superior cervical ganglion, cause the pupil to dilate when they contract. These muscles are sometimes referred to as intrinsic eye muscles.\nThe sensory pathway (rod or cone, bipolar, ganglion) is linked with its counterpart in the other eye by a partial crossover of each eye's fibers. This causes the effect in one eye to carry over to the other.\nEffect of light.\nThe pupil gets wider in the dark and narrower in light. When narrow, the diameter be 1.5 to 4 millimeters. In the dark it will be the same at first, but will approach the maximum distance for a wide pupil 3 to 8\u00a0mm. However, in any human age group there is considerable variation in maximal pupil size. For example, at the peak age of 15, the dark-adapted pupil can vary from 4\u00a0mm to 9\u00a0mm with different individuals. After 25 years of age, the average pupil size decreases, though not at a steady rate. At this stage the pupils do not remain completely still, therefore may lead to oscillation, which may intensify and become known as hippus. The constriction of the pupil and near vision are closely tied. In bright light, the pupils constrict to prevent aberrations of light rays and thus attain their expected acuity; in the dark, this is not necessary, so it is chiefly concerned with admitting sufficient light into the eye.\nWhen bright light is shone on the eye, light-sensitive cells in the retina, including rod and cone photoreceptors and melanopsin ganglion cells, will send signals to the oculomotor nerve, specifically the parasympathetic part coming from the Edinger-Westphal nucleus, which terminates on the circular iris sphincter muscle. When this muscle contracts, it reduces the size of the pupil. This is the pupillary light reflex, which is an important test of brainstem function. Furthermore, the pupil will dilate if a person sees an object of interest.\nClinical significance.\nEffect of drugs.\nIf the drug pilocarpine is administered, the pupils will constrict and accommodation is increased due to the parasympathetic action on the circular muscle fibers, conversely, atropine will cause paralysis of accommodation (cycloplegia) and dilation of the pupil.\nCertain drugs cause constriction of the pupils, such as opioids. Other drugs, such as atropine, LSD, MDMA, mescaline, psilocybin mushrooms, cocaine and amphetamines may cause pupil dilation.\nThe sphincter muscle has a parasympathetic innervation, and the dilator has a sympathetic innervation. In pupillary constriction induced by pilocarpine, not only is the sphincter nerve supply activated but that of the dilator is inhibited. The reverse is true, so control of pupil size is controlled by differences in contraction intensity of each muscle.\nAnother term for the constriction of the pupil is miosis. Substances that cause miosis are described as miotic. Dilation of the pupil is mydriasis. Dilation can be caused by mydriatic substances such as an eye drop solution containing tropicamide.\nDiseases.\nA condition called \"bene dilitatism\" occurs when the optic nerves are partially damaged. This condition is typified by chronically widened pupils due to the decreased ability of the optic nerves to respond to light. In normal lighting, people affected by this condition normally have dilated pupils, and bright lighting can cause pain. At the other end of the spectrum, people with this condition have trouble seeing in darkness. It is necessary for these people to be especially careful when driving at night due to their inability to see objects in their full perspective. This condition is not otherwise dangerous.\nSize.\nThe size of the pupil (often measured as diameter) can vary from 1.5 mm. to 8mm. Pupil size can be a symptom of an underlying disease. Dilation of the pupil is known as mydriasis and contraction as miosis.\nNot all variations in size are indicative of disease however. In addition to dilation and contraction caused by light and darkness, it has been shown that solving simple multiplication problems affects the size of the pupil. The simple act of recollection can dilate the size of the pupil, however when the brain is required to process at a rate above its maximum capacity, the pupils contract. There is also evidence that pupil size is related to the extent of positive or negative emotional arousal experienced by a person.\nMyopic individuals have larger resting and dark dilated pupils than hyperopic and emmetropic individuals, likely due to requiring less accommodation (which results in pupil constriction).\nSome humans are able to exert direct control over their iris muscles, giving them the ability to manipulate the size of their pupils (i.e. dilating and constricting them) on command, without any changes in lighting condition or eye accommodation state. However, this ability is likely very rare and its purpose or advantages over those without it are unclear.\nAnimals.\nNot all animals have circular pupils. Some have slits or ovals which may be oriented vertically, as in crocodiles, vipers, cats and foxes, or horizontally as in some rays, flying frogs, mongooses and artiodactyls such as elk, red deer, reindeer and hippopotamus, as well as the domestic horse. Goats, sheep, toads and octopus pupils tend to be horizontal and rectangular with rounded corners. Gecko pupils are generally of the shape of a slit with multiple notches, such that when it is closed, the pupil becomes a series of pinholes, and when it is open, the pupil is roughly circular. When a pupil has a slit form, it is sometimes called \"stenopaic\". The cuttlefish pupil is a smoothly curving W shape.\nBony fishes generally have circular pupils with a nearly spherical lens behind it. But in some, especially nocturnal ones, the pupil is elongated in the rostral end to create a lensless (aphakic) gap.\nAmphibian pupils can be circular (urodeles and aquatic anurans), horizontal oval (most anurans), horizontal diamond (\"Hyperolius horstockii\"), vertical diamond (\"Corythomantis greeningi\"), heart-shaped (\"Bombinator pachypus\"), vertically pear-shaped (\"Pelobates fuscus\") or diagonally pear-shaped (\"Caloptochephalus quoyi\").223 The king penguin's pupil when contracting in bright light becomes square-shaped. The pupil of some sharks is a diagonal slit, as in nurse shark, tassled wobbegong, and angel shark, though it is more commonly a vertical oval slit. It is a square diamond in the tiger shark. A certain \"Scyliorhinidae sp.\" is reported to have diagonal slit pupil with multiple openings, similar to that of a gecko. Most seals have vertical slit pupils, but \"Phoca barbata\" has diagonal slit pupils. Most prosimians have vertical slit pupils, except the tarsiers with their circular pupils with an enormous dynamic range.227\nOnly one bird, black skimmer, is known to have slit pupils.226\nLlamas and camels have horizontal rectangular pupils with a pair of serrated edges, such that when the pupil shrinks, the edges mesh together like two rows of fangs. This structure is the \"umbraculum\". In horses, gazelles, and goats, the umbraculum is much smaller, and in these species, the umbraculum is usually called the \"corpora nigra\" or sometimes the \"granula iridica\". Newborn horses have round pupils, but at around 5 years old, the pupil reaches its final form. The horse has 3 or 4 large ones on the top edge, and 5 or 6 small ones on the bottom edge. The sheep has up to 20, the highest recorded.227 Many artiodactyls have a similar pupil. The rock hyrax has a circular pupil with a spade-shaped umbraculum, attached to the upper edge of the pupil, and it contains muscles that can extend or contract independently of the pupil. Under a strong light, the pupil would contract, and the umbraculum would extend, shielding the pupil. This allows them to look into the sun, leading to a Zulu legend that they are blind. Similar structures appear in some Loricariids, flatfishes,222 the bottlenose dolphin, the beluga whale. In these species, it is usually called the \"operculum\" or the \"operculum pupillare\". In the bottlenose dolphin, it has the function of allowing equivalent visual acuity both in air and in water. The operculum of skates (such as the clearnose skate or the thornback skate) is particularly complex, as it is a spade with frills on its edges. Thus, at maximal extension, the pupil becomes a series of pinholes arranged in a U-shape.158 In a few amphibians, the tadpole has a similarly shaped structure named the \"elygium\", although it is disputed on whether it differs from the umbraculum.\nAlthough human pupils are normally circular, abnormalities like colobomas can result in unusual pupil shapes, such as teardrop, keyhole or oval pupil shapes.\nThere may be differences in pupil shape even between closely related animals. In felids, there are differences between small- and large eyed species. The domestic cat \"(Felis sylvestris domesticus)\" has vertical slit pupils, its large relative the Siberian tiger \"(Panthera tigris altaica)\" has circular pupils and the Eurasian lynx \"(Lynx lynx)\" is intermediate between those of the domestic cat and the Siberian tiger. A similar difference between small and large species may be present in canines. The small red fox \"(Vulpes vulpes)\" has vertical slit pupils whereas their large relatives, the gray wolf \"(Canis lupus lupus)\" and domestic dogs \"(Canis lupus familiaris)\" have round pupils.\nEvolution and adaptation.\nOne explanation for the evolution of slit pupils is that they can exclude light more effectively than a circular pupil. This would explain why slit pupils tend to be found in the eyes of animals with a crepuscular or nocturnal lifestyle that need to protect their eyes during daylight. Constriction of a circular pupil (by a ring-shaped muscle) is less complete than closure of a slit pupil, which uses two additional muscles that laterally compress the pupil. For example, the cat's slit pupil can change the light intensity on the retina 135-fold compared to 10-fold in humans. However, this explanation does not account for circular pupils that can be closed to a very small size (e.g., 0.5\u00a0mm in the tarsier) and the rectangular pupils of many ungulates which do not close to a narrow slit in bright light. An alternative explanation is that a partially constricted circular pupil shades the peripheral zones of the lens which would lead to poorly focused images at relevant wavelengths. The vertical slit pupil allows for use of all wavelengths across the full diameter of the lens, even in bright light. It has also been suggested that in ambush predators such as some snakes, vertical slit pupils may aid in camouflage, breaking up the circular outline of the eye.\nThe W-shape of the cuttlefish reduces light from the dorsal visual field significantly more than it reduces light from the horizontal band. This is hypothesized to benefit cuttlefish in its natural habitat, where the scene is brighter near the sea surface. Also, it preserves more of the frontal and caudal visual acuity compared to a circular pupil.\nMany pupils, at maximal constriction, would become two or more pinholes. The pinholes are vertically aligned in some geckos and the cat. In the geckos, there are usually 4 diamond pinholes. The pinholes are horizontally aligned in many species with prominently horizontal rectangular pupils, such as the goat, the horse, and many artiodactyls. The pinholes are U-shaped in some skates.158 Similarly, in species with a roughly horizontal pupil and an operculum, when the operculum is maximally extended, it would bisect the pupil into two vertical slits. This is usually assumed to have certain optical advantages. For example, it is shown that by dividing the pupil in the middle by an operculum, a nocturnal animal may have a slit pupil that protects the retina, and yet still pass high spatial frequencies. One hypothesis for the gecko's multi-pinhole eye is that it allows the eye to use defocus blur to estimate distance, similar to Scheiner's disc used in clinical eye examination. Generally, animals that form multiple pinholes under bright light have rod-rich retinas, have no fovea, and are neither strictly nocturnal nor strictly diurnal.\nActivity pattern and behavior.\nIn a study of Australian snakes, pupil shapes correlated both with diel activity times and with foraging behavior. Most snake species with vertical pupils were nocturnal and also ambush foragers, and most snakes with circular pupils were diurnal and active foragers. Overall, foraging behaviour predicted pupil shape accurately in more cases than did diel time of activity, because many active-foraging snakes with circular pupils were not diurnal. It has been suggested that there may be a similar link between foraging behaviour and pupil shape amongst the felidae and canidae discussed above.\nA 2015 study confirmed the hypothesis that elongated pupils have increased dynamic range, and furthered the correlations with diel activity. However it noted that other hypotheses could not explain the orientation of the pupils. They showed that vertical pupils enable ambush predators to optimise their depth perception, and horizontal pupils to optimise the field of view and image quality of horizontal contours. They further explained why elongated pupils are correlated with the animal's height.\nSociety and culture.\nThe pupil plays a role in eye contact and nonverbal communication. The voluntary or involuntary enlargement or dilation of the pupils indicates cognitive arousal, interest in the subject of attention, and/or sexual arousal. On the other hand, when the pupil is voluntarily or involuntarily contracted, it could indicate the opposite - disinterest or disgust. Exceptionally large or dilated pupils are also perceived to be an attractive feature in body language.\nIn a surprising number of unrelated languages, the etymological meaning of the term for pupil is \"little person\". This is true, for example, of the word \"pupil\" itself: this comes into English from Latin \"p\u016bpilla\", which means \"doll, girl\", and is a diminutive form of \"pupa\", \"girl\". (The double meaning in Latin is preserved in English, where \"pupil\" means both \"schoolchild\" and \"dark central portion of the eye within the iris\".) This may be because the reflection of one's image in the pupil is a minuscule version of one's self. In the Old Babylonian period (c. 1800-1600 BC) in ancient Mesopotamia, the expression \"protective spirit of the eye\" is attested, perhaps arising from the same phenomenon.\nThe English phrase \"apple of my eye\" arises from an Old English usage, in which the word \"apple\" meant not only the fruit but also the pupil or eyeball.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The film was produced by Thomas H. Ince, directed by Reginald Barker, and co-written by C. Gardner Sullivan and Ince. The film stars stage actor George Beban in the title role as the Italian immigrant, Pietro \"Beppo\" Donnetti. In 1991, this film was deemed \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\" by the United States Library of Congress and selected for preservation in the National Film Registry.\nPlot.\nThe film tells the story of Pietro \"Beppo\" Donnetti. Donnetti is a poor, but happy, gondolier in Venice, Italy. Beppo falls in love with Annette Ancello, but her father, Trudo, wants her to marry another suitor, one who is a successful businessman. If Beppo can prove himself within a year, Trudo agrees to allow him to marry Annette.\nBeppo sails for America to make his fortune, making a living working as a shoeshiner on a street corner in New York City. He borrows money from an Irish ward boss, Bill Corrigan, and sends for Annette to join him. In exchange, Beppo agrees to help Corrigan's candidate win the Italian vote in the ward.\nWhen Annette arrives in New York, she and Beppo are married, and the following year they have a son, Tony. Beppo, Annette and Tony live a happy life in their Lower East Side tenement. The happiness is interrupted when the baby contracts a fever during a heatwave. The doctor instructs them to feed pasteurized milk to the baby. Beppo works hard to earn the money to purchase the expensive milk. While walking to the store to buy the milk, Beppo is robbed. He attacks the men who robbed him and is arrested. Beppo asks Corrigan to help his baby while he is in jail: \"I must get-a-de-milk or my babee is die.\" Corrigan rebuffs Beppo, and Beppo's baby dies during Beppo's five days in jail.\nWhen Beppo is released from jail, he learns that Corrigan's young daughter is ill and vows to avenge his son's death by killing Corrigan's daughter. Beppo sneaks into Corrigan's house, but when he sees Corrigan's daughter lying in her crib, he cannot act on his plan, and he leaves the child unharmed.\nIn the final scene of the narrative, Beppo is shown placing flowers and sobbing over his son's grave.\nPrologue and epilogue.\nThe film employs a prologue and epilogue to frame the narrative story. In the prologue, a stage curtain rises and shows the lead actor, George Beban, in an upper class apartment wearing a smoking jacket. He sits on a couch and opens a book titled \"The Italian\" by Thomas H. Ince and C. Gardner Sullivan. As he begins reading, the film fades into the narrative story. In the epilogue, the film shifts from the image of Beppo kneeling at his son's grave to Beban turning to the last page of the book, closing the book and looking thoughtful. The stage curtain is then drawn closed.\nSome critics have suggested the prologue and epilogue were intended to demonstrate the care with which Beban, a noted stage actor, had selected a story worthy of his talents.\nProduction.\nHistorical accounts indicate that Thomas Ince and C. Gardner Sullivan had originally titled their project \"Dago\", but agreed to change the title at the request of the film's star, George Beban. \"The Italian\" marked the first motion picture role for Beban, who had gained acclaim as a Broadway actor and vaudevillian specializing in ethnic caricatures. Beban only agreed to join the project for a salary of $7000 and a percentage of the films profits.\nInce and Sullivan are credited with writing the film's story, but film historian Kevin Brownlow has shown that the plot was essentially lifted from the earlier Independent Moving Pictures (Ince's former employer) film \"The Wop\" (1913).\nThough set on Manhattan's Lower East Side, the New York scenes for \"The Italian\" were shot in the immigrant quarter of San Francisco. While most accounts indicate that the scenes of Beppo as a gondolier were shot in the Venice district of Los Angeles, an account published by the \"Los Angeles Times\" in November 1914 reported that \"Ince sent Beban to Italy to get special canal scenes for the eight-reel play.\"\nOne of the vivid scenes in \"The Italian\" is the fight scene between Beppo and his muggers. The scene lasts five minutes on the screen, and a newspaper story reported that, for realism, \"a number of the biggest men at Inceville were used in the scene.\"\nIn a story on the production of \"The Italian\", a newspaper reported that a hundred pounds of rice were bought for the film's wedding scene. An initial order of fifty pounds of rice was left uncovered overnight by a \"property man\" at the Inceville studio. A \"heavy rain caused each grain to swell to enormous proportions,\" requiring the purchase of another fifty pounds of rice.\nCritical reception.\nInitial reviews.\nUpon the release of \"The Italian\", the \"Los Angeles Times\" gave the film a positive review which included the following comments:\"There are possibilities in the role of Pietro, in 'The Italian' ... that a less clever character artist than George Beban might overlook ... The story is full of human interest, requiring a full understanding of the character, and Beban by look and gesture is at all times in fullest sympathy with the difficult role. ... [A]ll go to make a story that pulsates with human interest. The pathos of the child's death because of the lack of necessities and the imprisonment of the poor Italian furnish the real lesson of the Ghetto.\"\n\"The Washington Post\" called it \"a fascinating story,\" and \"a simple story of ghetto life, showing that love, faith, and loyalty are not unknown quantities in this dark sphere.\"\nA newspaper in Fort Wayne, Indiana praised the film for its \"rare quality of charm and a warmth of appeal that is truly unique\" and concluded: \"Here is a story beautiful and exquisite in theme ... Its simplicity and utter humanness have an appeal that reaches straight to the heart of the onlooker.\" Another review in the same paper also commended the \"simple beauty of the story itself\" and also praised Beban's performance:\"George Beban, who has the difficult role of Pietro Donnetti, gives a piece of character work that is truly marvelous. This artist has developed mimicry to its highest form of expression. His mobile countenance mirrored every emotion so perfectly, each varying mood was portrayed so truly, that it was hard to believe that this man was naught but a pantomimist. The upward glance when the heart was bitten again by the fangs of emotion, the hysterical joy of the Latin nature when in high spirits, all these phrases were delineated by this artist in a way that moved and thrilled.\"\nA newspaper in San Antonio, Texas praised the \"vein of innocent humor\" that runs through the film at the expense of Beppo and concluded: \"'The Italian' is regarded as Thomas H. Ince's masterpiece and is said to be greater than his 'Wrath of the Gods,' 'The Typhoon' and 'The Bargain.'\"\nModern assessments.\nIn 2008, \"The Italian\" was released on DVD as part of a two-disc compilation titled, \"Perils of the New Land: Films of the Immigrant Experience (1910-1915).\" At the time of the DVD release, \"The New York Times\" praised the film for Reginald Barker's strong direction, including his use of a mobile camera and \"liberal use of close-up\" which give the film a subjective, personal feel. The \"Times\" also praised Beban's \"powerful lead performance\" which it described as follows:\"The audience is drawn to identify with Beppo, even though he remains in many respects an appalling ethnic caricature: dark, brooding, vengeful. That Barker and Beban are able to create so much sympathy for Beppo, despite their own, occasionally quite obvious condescension to the character, is a mark of emerging maturity in the movie business; no longer are films dealing in one-dimensional 'types.'\"\nThe \"Los Angeles Times\" in 2008 described \"The Italian\" as \"a shameless melodrama that, despite unfortunate stereotypes, musters considerable sympathy for its titular immigrant.\" The \"Times\" also noted that \"Beban, the silent-era star known for his ethnic impersonations, hams up a storm as Beppo, a jaunty Venetian.\"\nThe film publication \"Cineaste\" published a review of \"The Italian\" in March 2009, focusing on the film's depiction of the Italian-American immigrant experience as a Darwinian jungle rather than a promised land paved with gold:\"Against Horatio Alger expectations, \"The Italian\" is a story of failure suffused with a soft-focused, dappled nostalgia for the old country ... 'From sunny Italy to the New York ghetto,' read the taglines on Paramount's original one-sheet, contrasting scenes of 'carefree Beppo at home' in the serene canals of Old Italy with the mean streets of New York where 'to live your baby must have Pasteurized milk.' America is not a promised land paved with gold but a Darwinian jungle, where dreams meet dead ends.\"\nCineaste also credited Beban for his intense performance, commenting on the fight sequence in which Beban's character \"seethes with murderous determination\" as the camera focuses on his face in an extreme close-up: \"Beban's sudden transformation from amiability to wrath recalls the first glimpse of Spencer Tracy after nearly being lynched in Fritz Lang's \"Fury\".\"\nA reviewer for the publication \"Bright Sights\" wrote that the film had a powerfully downbeat conclusion with a social message:\"Projecting overwhelming grief, Beban reveals some hefty acting chops, and \"The Italian\" certainly gets its liberal point across, a model of how American movies dress social consciousness in the garb of melodrama. Even here, in its infancy, feature film was eager to pick up the call for social reform that sounded out in urban America before the First World War.\"\nIn his 2004 historical book on the depiction of Italians in Hollywood movies, Peter Bondanella praised the film:\"A number of elements sets \"The Italian\" apart from the other films treating the Italian immigrant experience. ... Its melodramatic plot reflects a serious sense of artistic construction, aimed at milking the last bit of emotion out of the audience. George Beban's outstanding performance shows his roots in the dramatic theater. ... Finally, the depiction of the tragic story of Beppo shows a certain sympathy for the character of the poor Italian bootblack but also includes a callous disregard for depicting Italian immigrants in a stereotypical manner, an attitude that no doubt reflected the opinions of the majority of Americans at the time. Its plot is simple and compelling.\"\nDespite its occasional use of patronizing stereotypes, Bondanella concludes that Beppo \"is represented with great dignity and even comic twists, making Beppo a far more lovable figure than one might expect.\" He concludes his chapter on the film with the following comment: \"In short, what emerges from \"The Italian\" is an unusually complex view of tenement life and multiethnic immigration in America, and the film consequently retains its value not only as social history but also as a work of art.\"\nIn his book about the history of film editing, Don Fairservice credits \"The Italian\"'s director, Reginald Barker, for his early use of editing to maintain story continuity and for his use of multidirectional camera positioning and variable framing to emphasize character development and psychological motivation rather than plot.\nA review in \"DVD Talk\" concluded that Beban's performance was able to overcome the film's melodramatic premise:\"Beppo is a delightful character ... His rage after being robbed was another standout moment. The camera does a very tight closeup, one of the closest I can recall for a film from 1915, and his anger and fear are almost palatable. ... The ending of the film is also very dramatic and works well, without a false Hollywood happy ending ... It was nice to see the hardships of poverty portrayed without any easy answers, something that doesn't often happen.\"\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "74830", "revid": "49214", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=74830", "title": "Jaws (film)", "text": "1975 thriller film by Steven Spielberg\nJaws is a 1975 American thriller film directed by Steven Spielberg. Based on the 1974 novel by Peter Benchley, it stars Roy Scheider as police chief Martin Brody, who, with the help of a marine biologist (Richard Dreyfuss) and a professional shark hunter (Robert Shaw), hunts a man-eating great white shark that attacks beachgoers at a New England summer resort town. Murray Hamilton plays the town's mayor, and Lorraine Gary portrays Brody's wife. The screenplay is credited to Benchley, who wrote the first drafts, and actor-writer Carl Gottlieb, who rewrote the script during principal photography.\nShot mostly on location at Martha's Vineyard in Massachusetts from May to October 1974, \"Jaws\" was the first major motion picture to be shot on the ocean and consequently had a troubled production, going over budget and schedule. As the art department's mechanical sharks often malfunctioned, Spielberg decided to mostly suggest the shark's presence, employing an ominous and minimalist theme created by composer John Williams to indicate its impending appearances. Spielberg and others have compared this suggestive approach to that of director Alfred Hitchcock. Universal Pictures released the film to over 450 screens, an exceptionally wide release for a major studio picture at the time, accompanied by an extensive marketing campaign with heavy emphasis on television spots and tie-in merchandise.\nRegarded as a turning point in motion picture history, \"Jaws\" was the prototypical summer blockbuster and won several awards for its music and editing. It was the highest-grossing film in history until the release of \"Star Wars\" two years later; both films were pivotal in establishing the modern Hollywood business model, which pursues high box-office returns from action and adventure films with simple high-concept premises, released during the summer in thousands of theaters and advertised heavily. \"Jaws\" was followed by three sequels, none of which involved Spielberg or Benchley, as well as many imitative thrillers. In 2001, the Library of Congress selected it for preservation in the United States National Film Registry.\nPlot.\nIn the New England beach town of Amity Island, a young woman goes for a late-night ocean swim. An unseen force attacks and pulls her underwater. Her partial remains are found washed up on the beach the next morning. After the coroner concludes it was a shark attack, Amity police chief Martin Brody plans to close the beaches. Mayor Larry Vaughn persuades him to reconsider, fearing the town's summer economy will suffer. The coroner, apparently under pressure, now concurs with the mayor's theory that it was a boating accident. Brody reluctantly accepts their conclusion until young Alex Kintner is killed at a crowded beach. A $3,000 bounty is placed on the shark, causing an amateur shark-hunting frenzy. Quint, an eccentric local shark hunter, offers his services for $10,000. Consulting oceanographer Matt Hooper examines the girl's remains, confirming she was killed by an unusually large shark.\nWhen local fishermen catch a tiger shark, Vaughn declares the beaches safe. A skeptical Hooper dissects the shark and, finding no human remains inside its stomach, concludes the killer shark is still active. While searching the night waters in Hooper's boat, Hooper and Brody find the half-sunken boat of Ben Gardner, a local fisherman. Hooper dons a scuba suit and goes underwater to check the boat's hull and finds a large shark tooth embedded into it. He drops the tooth after encountering Gardner's severed head. Vaughn dismisses Brody and Hooper's assertions that a great white shark caused the deaths and refuses to close the beaches, allowing only increased safety precautions. On the Fourth of July weekend, tourists pack the beaches. The shark enters a nearby lagoon, killing a boater and nearly killing Brody's son, Michael, who is hospitalized with shock. Brody then convinces a guilt-ridden Vaughn to hire Quint.\nDespite initial tension between Quint and Hooper, and Brody's fear of the ocean, the three head out to sea on Quint's boat, the \"Orca\", to hunt for the shark. As Brody lays down a chum line, the shark suddenly appears behind the boat. Quint, estimating it is long and weighs , harpoons it with a line attached to a flotation barrel, but the shark pulls it underwater and disappears.\nAt nightfall, Quint and Hooper drunkenly exchange stories about their assorted body scars. One of Quint's is a removed tattoo; he reveals that during World War II, he survived the sinking of the , during which sharks killed many U.S. sailors. The shark returns, ramming the boat's hull and disabling the power. The men work through the night, repairing the engine. In the morning, Brody attempts to call the Coast Guard, but Quint, obsessed with killing the shark without outside assistance, smashes the radio. After a long chase, Quint harpoons the shark with another barrel. The line is tied to the stern cleats, but the shark drags the boat backward, swamping the deck and flooding the engine compartment. As Quint is about to sever the line to save the boat's transom, the cleats break off. The barrels stay attached to the shark. To Brody's relief, Quint speeds the \"Orca\" toward shore to draw the shark into shallower waters, but the damaged engine fails.\nAs the boat takes on water, the trio attempt a riskier approach. Hooper suits up and enters a shark-proof cage, intending to lethally inject the shark with strychnine via a hypodermic spear. The shark attacks the cage, causing Hooper to drop the spear. While the shark destroys the cage, Hooper escapes to the ocean bottom. The shark leaps onto the boat's stern, subsequently devouring Quint. Trapped on the sinking vessel, Brody thrusts a scuba tank into the shark's mouth and, climbing onto the crow's nest, shoots the tank with a rifle. The resulting explosion kills the shark. Hooper resurfaces and he and Brody paddle back to shore, clinging to the remaining barrels.\nProduction.\nDevelopment.\nRichard D. Zanuck and David Brown, producers at Universal Pictures, independently heard about Peter Benchley's novel \"Jaws\". Brown came across it in the literature section of lifestyle magazine \"Cosmopolitan\", which at that time was edited by his wife, Helen Gurley Brown. A small card written by the magazine's book editor gave a detailed description of the plot, concluding with the comment \"might make a good movie\". The producers each read the book over the course of a single night and agreed the next morning that it was \"the most exciting thing that they had ever read\" and that they wanted to produce a film version, although they were unsure how it would be accomplished. They purchased the film rights in 1973, before the book's publication, for approximately $175,000 (). Brown claimed that had they read the book twice, they would never have made the film because they would have realized how difficult it would be to execute certain sequences.\nTo direct, Zanuck and Brown first considered veteran filmmaker John Sturges\u2014whose r\u00e9sum\u00e9 included another maritime adventure, \"The Old Man and the Sea\"\u2014before offering the job to Dick Richards, whose directorial debut, \"The Culpepper Cattle Co.\", had come out the previous year. They soon grew irritated by Richards's habit of describing the shark as a whale and dropped him from the project. Meanwhile, Steven Spielberg very much wanted the job. The 26-year-old had just directed his first theatrical film, \"The Sugarland Express\", for Zanuck and Brown. At the end of a meeting in their office, Spielberg noticed their copy of the still-unpublished Benchley novel, and after reading it was immediately captivated. He later observed that it was similar to his 1971 television film \"Duel\" in that both deal with \"these leviathans targeting everymen\". He also revealed in \"The Making of \"Jaws\"\" documentary on the 2012 DVD release that he directly referenced \"Duel\" by repurposing the sound of the truck being destroyed as the death roar of the shark. After Richards's departure, the producers signed Spielberg to direct in June 1973, before the release of \"The Sugarland Express\".\nBefore production began, Spielberg grew reluctant to continue with \"Jaws\", in fear of becoming typecast as the \"truck and shark director\". He wanted to move over to 20th Century Fox's \"Lucky Lady\" instead, but Universal exercised its right under its contract with the director to veto his departure. Brown helped convince Spielberg to stick with the project, saying that \"after [\"Jaws\"], you can make all the films you want\". The film was given an estimated budget of $3.5\u00a0million and a shooting schedule of 55\u00a0days. Principal photography was set to begin in May 1974. Universal wanted the shoot to finish by the end of June, when the major studios' contract with the Screen Actors Guild was due to expire, to avoid any disruptions due to a potential strike.\nWriting.\nFor the screen adaptation, Spielberg wanted to stay with the novel's basic plot, but discarded Benchley's subplots. He declared that his favorite part of the book was the shark hunt on the last 120\u00a0pages, and told Zanuck when he accepted the job, \"I'd like to do the picture if I could change the first two acts and base the first two acts on original screenplay material, and then be very true to the book for the last third.\" When the producers purchased the rights to his novel, they promised Benchley that he could write the first draft of the screenplay. The intent was to make sure a script could be done despite an impending threat of a Writer's Guild strike, given Benchley was not unionized. Benchley wrote three drafts before the script was turned over to other writers; delivering his final version to Spielberg, he declared, \"I'm written out on this, and that's the best I can do.\" Benchley later described his contribution to the finished film as \"the storyline and the ocean stuff\u2014basically, the mechanics\", given he \"didn't know how to put the character texture into a screenplay.\" One of the changes was to remove the novel's adulterous affair between Ellen Brody and Matt Hooper, at the suggestion of Spielberg, who feared it would compromise the camaraderie between the men on the \"Orca\". During the film's production, Benchley agreed to play a small onscreen role as a reporter.\nSpielberg, who felt that the characters in Benchley's script were still unlikable, invited the young screenwriter John Byrum to do a rewrite, but he declined the offer. \"Columbo\" creators William Link and Richard Levinson also declined Spielberg's invitation. Tony and Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright Howard Sackler was in Los Angeles when the filmmakers began looking for another writer and offered to do an uncredited rewrite; since the producers and Spielberg were unhappy with Benchley's drafts, they quickly agreed. At the suggestion of Spielberg, Brody's characterization made him afraid of water, \"coming from an urban jungle to find something more terrifying off this placid island near Massachusetts.\"\nSpielberg wanted \"some levity\" in \"Jaws\", humor that would avoid making it \"a dark sea hunt\", so he turned to his friend Carl Gottlieb, a comedy writer-actor then working on the sitcom \"The Odd Couple\". Spielberg sent Gottlieb a script, asking what the writer would change and if there was a role he would be interested in performing. Gottlieb sent Spielberg three pages of notes, and picked the part of Harry Meadows, the politically connected editor of Amity's newspaper. He passed the audition one week before Spielberg took him to meet the producers regarding a writing job.\nWhile the deal was initially for a \"one-week dialogue polish\", Gottlieb eventually became the primary screenwriter, rewriting nearly the entire script during a nine-week period of principal photography. The script for each scene was typically finished the night before it was shot, after Gottlieb had dinner with Spielberg and members of the cast and crew to decide what would go into the film. Many pieces of dialogue originated from the actors' improvisations during these meals; a few were created on set just prior to filming. John Milius contributed other dialogue polishes, and \"Sugarland Express\" writers Matthew Robbins and Hal Barwood also made uncredited contributions. Spielberg has claimed that he prepared his own draft, although it is unclear to what degree the other screenwriters drew on his material. One specific alteration he called for in the story was to change the cause of the shark's death from extensive wounds to a scuba tank explosion, as he felt audiences would respond better to a \"big rousing ending\". The director estimated the final script had a total of 27 scenes that were not in the book.\nBenchley had written \"Jaws\" after reading about sport fisherman Frank Mundus's capture of an enormous shark in 1964. According to Gottlieb, Quint was loosely based on Mundus, whose book \"Sportfishing for Sharks\" he read for research. Sackler came up with the backstory of Quint as a survivor of the World War II disaster. The question of who deserves the most credit for writing Quint's monologue about the \"Indianapolis\" has caused substantial controversy. Spielberg described it as a collaboration between Sackler, Milius, and actor Robert Shaw, who was also a playwright. According to the director, Milius turned Sackler's \"three-quarters of a page\" speech into a monologue, and that was then partially rewritten by Shaw. Gottlieb gives primary credit to Shaw, downplaying Milius's contribution.\nCasting.\nThough Spielberg complied with a request from Zanuck and Brown to cast known actors and Benchley suggesting Robert Redford, Paul Newman and Steve McQueen for the leads, he wanted to avoid hiring any big stars. He felt that \"somewhat anonymous\" performers would help the audience \"believe this was happening to people like you and me\", whereas \"stars bring a lot of memories along with them, and those memories can sometimes\u00a0... corrupt the story.\" The director added that in his plans \"the superstar was gonna be the shark\". The first actors cast were Lorraine Gary, the wife of Universal president, Sidney Sheinberg, as Ellen Brody, and Murray Hamilton as the mayor of Amity Island. Stuntwoman-turned-actress Susan Backlinie was cast as Chrissie Watkins (the first victim) as she knew how to swim and was willing to perform nude. Most minor roles were played by residents of Martha's Vineyard, where the film was shot. One example was Deputy Hendricks, played by future television producer Jeffrey Kramer. Lee Fierro plays Mrs. Kintner, the mother of the shark's second victim Alex Kintner (played by Jeffrey Voorhees).\nThe role of Brody was offered to Robert Duvall, but the actor was interested only in portraying Quint. Charlton Heston expressed a desire for the role but Spielberg felt that Heston would bring a screen persona too grand for the part of a police chief of a modest community. Roy Scheider became interested in the project after overhearing Spielberg at a party talk with a screenwriter about having the shark jump up onto a boat. Spielberg was apprehensive about hiring Scheider, fearing he would portray a \"tough guy\", similar to his role in \"The French Connection\".\nNine days before the start of production, neither Quint nor Hooper had been cast. The role of Quint was originally offered to actors Lee Marvin and Sterling Hayden, both of whom passed. Zanuck and Brown had just finished working with Robert Shaw on \"The Sting\", and suggested him to Spielberg. Shaw was reluctant to take the role since he did not like the book but decided to accept at the urging of both his wife (actress Mary Ure) and his secretary\u2014\"The last time they were that enthusiastic was \"From Russia with Love\". And they were right\". Shaw based his performance on fellow cast member Craig Kingsbury, a local fisherman, farmer and legendary eccentric, who was cast in the small role of fisherman Ben Gardner. Spielberg described Kingsbury as \"the purest version of who, in my mind, Quint was\" and some of his offscreen utterances were incorporated into the script as lines of both Gardner and Quint. Another source for some of Quint's dialogue and mannerisms, especially in the third act at sea, was Vineyard mechanic and boat-owner Lynn Murphy.\nFor the role of Hooper, Spielberg initially wanted Jon Voight. Timothy Bottoms, Jan-Michael Vincent, Joel Grey, and Jeff Bridges were also considered for the part. Spielberg's friend George Lucas suggested Richard Dreyfuss, whom he had directed in \"American Graffiti\". The actor initially passed but changed his decision after he attended a pre-release screening of \"The Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz\", which he had just completed. Disappointed in his performance and fearing that no one would want to hire him once \"Kravitz\" was released, he immediately called Spielberg and accepted the role in \"Jaws\". Because the film the director envisioned was so dissimilar to Benchley's novel, Spielberg asked Dreyfuss not to read it. As a result of the casting, Hooper was rewritten to better suit the actor, as well as to be more representative of Spielberg, who came to view Dreyfuss as his \"alter ego\".\nFilming.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nWe started the film without a script, without a cast and without a shark.\n\u2014Actor Richard Dreyfuss on the film's troubled production\nPrincipal photography began on May 2, 1974, on the island of Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts, selected after consideration was given to eastern Long Island. Brown explained later that the production \"needed a vacation area that was lower middle class enough so that an appearance of a shark would destroy the tourist business.\" Martha's Vineyard was also chosen because the surrounding ocean had a sandy bottom that never dropped below for out from shore, which allowed the mechanical sharks to operate while also beyond sight of land. As Spielberg wanted to film the aquatic sequences relatively close-up to resemble what people see while swimming, cinematographer Bill Butler devised new equipment to facilitate marine and underwater shooting, including a rig to keep the camera stable, regardless of tide, and a sealed submersible camera box. Spielberg asked the art department to avoid red in both scenery and wardrobe, so that the blood from the attacks would be the only red element and cause a bigger shock.\nInitially the film's producers wanted to train a great white shark but quickly realized this was not possible, so three full-size pneumatically powered prop sharks\u2014which the film crew nicknamed \"Bruce\" after Spielberg's lawyer, Bruce Ramer\u2014were made for the production: a \"sea-sled shark\", a full-body prop with its belly missing that was towed with a line, and two \"platform sharks\", one that moved from camera-left to right (with its hidden left side exposing an array of pneumatic hoses), and an opposite model with its right flank uncovered. The sharks were designed by art director and production designer Joe Alves during the third quarter of 1973. Between November 1973 and April 1974, the sharks were fabricated at Rolly Harper's Motion Picture &amp; Equipment Rental in Sun Valley, California. Their construction involved a team of as many as 40 effects technicians, supervised by mechanical effects supervisor Bob Mattey, best known for creating the giant squid in \"20,000 Leagues Under the Sea\". After the sharks were completed, they were trucked to the shooting location. In early July, the platform used to tow the two side-view sharks capsized as it was being lowered to the ocean floor, forcing a team of divers to retrieve it. The model required 14 operators to control all of the moving parts. For Quint's boat, the \"Orca\", Alves and his team constructed two identical 42-foot models for the film. The second boat, dubbed \"Orca II\", had no motor and was designed to sink on command.\n\"Jaws\" was the first major motion picture to be shot on the ocean, resulting in a troubled shoot, and went far over budget. David Brown said that the budget \"was $4\u00a0million and the picture wound up costing $9\u00a0million\"; the effects outlays alone grew to $3 million due to the problems with the mechanical sharks. Disgruntled crew members gave the film the nickname \"Flaws\". Spielberg attributed many problems to his perfectionism and his inexperience. The former was epitomized by his insistence on shooting at sea with a life-sized shark; \"I could have shot the movie in the tank or even in a protected lake somewhere, but it would not have looked the same,\" he said. As for his lack of experience: \"I was naive about the ocean, basically. I was pretty naive about mother nature and the hubris of a filmmaker who thinks he can conquer the elements was foolhardy, but I was too young to know I was being foolhardy when I demanded that we shoot the film in the Atlantic Ocean and not in a North Hollywood tank.\" Gottlieb said that \"there was nothing to do except make the movie\", so everyone kept overworking, and while as a writer he did not have to attend the ocean set every day, once the crewmen returned they arrived \"ravaged and sunburnt, windblown and covered with salt water\".\nShooting at sea led to many delays: unwanted sailboats drifted into frame, cameras got soaked, and the \"Orca\" once began to sink with the actors on board. The prop sharks frequently malfunctioned owing to a series of problems including bad weather, pneumatic hoses taking on salt water, frames fracturing due to water resistance, corroding skin, and electrolysis. From the first water test onward, the \"non-absorbent\" neoprene foam that made up the sharks' skin soaked up liquid, causing the sharks to balloon, and the sea-sled model frequently got entangled among forests of seaweed. Spielberg later calculated that during the 12-hour daily work schedule, on average only four hours were actually spent filming. Gottlieb was nearly decapitated by the boat's propellers, and Dreyfuss was almost imprisoned in the steel cage. The actors were frequently seasick. Shaw also fled to Canada whenever he could due to tax problems, engaged in binge drinking, and developed a grudge against Dreyfuss, who was getting rave reviews for his performance in \"Duddy Kravitz\". Editor Verna Fields rarely had material to work with during principal photography, as according to Spielberg \"we would shoot five scenes in a good day, three in an average day, and none in a bad day.\"\nThe delays proved beneficial in some regards. The script was refined during production, and the unreliable mechanical sharks forced Spielberg to shoot many scenes so that the shark was only hinted at. For example, for much of the shark hunt, its location is indicated by the floating yellow barrels. The opening had the shark devouring Chrissie, but it was rewritten so that it would be shot with Backlinie being dragged and yanked by cables to simulate an attack. Spielberg also included multiple shots of just the dorsal fin. This forced restraint is widely thought to have added to the film's suspense. As Spielberg put it years later, \"The film went from a Japanese Saturday matinee horror flick to more of a Hitchcock, the less-you-see-the-more-you-get thriller.\" In another interview, he similarly declared, \"The shark not working was a godsend. It made me become more like Alfred Hitchcock than like Ray Harryhausen.\" The acting became crucial for making audiences believe in such a big shark: \"The more fake the shark looked in the water, the more my anxiety told me to heighten the naturalism of the performances.\"\nFootage of real sharks was shot by Ron and Valerie Taylor in the waters off Dangerous Reef in South Australia, with a short actor in a miniature shark cage to create the illusion that the sharks were enormous. During the Taylors' shoot, a great white attacked the boat and cage. The footage of the cage attack was so stunning that Spielberg was eager to incorporate it in the film. No one had been in the cage at the time and the script, following the novel, originally had the shark killing Hooper in it. The storyline was consequently altered to have Hooper escape from the cage, which allowed the footage to be used. As production executive Bill Gilmore put it, \"The shark down in Australia rewrote the script and saved Dreyfuss's character.\"\nAlthough principal photography was scheduled to take 55 days, it did not wrap until October 6, 1974, after 159 days. Spielberg, reflecting on the protracted shoot, stated, \"I thought my career as a filmmaker was over. I heard rumors\u00a0... that I would never work again because no one had ever taken a film 100 days over schedule.\" Spielberg was offered, several times, to bow out from the film to shut down production. Spielberg himself was not present for the shooting of the final scene in which the shark explodes, as he believed that the crew were planning to throw him in the water when the scene was done. It has since become a tradition for Spielberg to be absent when the final scene of one of his films is being shot. Afterward, underwater scenes were shot at the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios water tank in Culver City, with stuntmen Dick Warlock and Frank James Sparks as stand-ins for Dreyfuss in the scene where the shark attacks the cage, as well as near Santa Catalina Island, California. Fields, who had completed a rough cut of the first two-thirds of the film, up until the shark hunt, finished the editing and reworked some of the material. According to Zanuck, \"She actually came in and reconstructed some scenes that Steven had constructed for comedy and made them terrifying, and some scenes he shot to be terrifying and made them comedy scenes.\" The boat used for the \"Orca\" was brought to Los Angeles so the sound effects team could record sounds for both the ship and the underwater scenes.\nTwo scenes were altered following test screenings. As the audience's screams had covered up Scheider's \"bigger boat\" one-liner, Brody's reaction after the shark jumps behind him was extended, and the volume of the line was raised. Spielberg also decided that he was greedy for \"one more scream\", and reshot the scene in which Hooper discovers Ben Gardner's body, using $3,000 of his own money after Universal refused to pay for the reshoot. The underwater scene was shot in Fields's swimming pool in Encino, California, using a lifecast latex model of Craig Kingsbury's head attached to a fake body, which was placed in the wrecked boat's hull. To simulate the murky waters of Martha's Vineyard, powdered milk was poured into the pool, which was then covered with a tarpaulin.\nMusic.\nJohn Williams composed the film's score, which earned him an Academy Award and was later ranked the sixth-greatest score by the American Film Institute. The main \"shark\" theme, a simple alternating pattern of two notes\u2014variously identified as \"E and F\" or \"F and F sharp\"\u2014became a classic piece of suspense music, synonymous with approaching danger (see leading-tone). Williams described the theme as \"grinding away at you, just as a shark would do, instinctual, relentless, unstoppable.\" The piece was performed by tuba player Tommy Johnson. When asked by Johnson why the melody was written in such a high register and not played by the more appropriate French horn, Williams responded that he wanted it to sound \"a little more threatening\". When Williams first demonstrated his idea to Spielberg, playing just the two notes on a piano, Spielberg was said to have laughed, thinking that it was a joke. As Williams saw similarities between \"Jaws\" and pirate movies, at other points in the score he evoked \"pirate music\", which he called \"primal, but fun and entertaining\". Calling for rapid, percussive string playing, the score contains echoes of Claude Debussy's \"La mer\" and of Igor Stravinsky's \"The Rite of Spring\".\nThere are various interpretations of the meaning and effectiveness of the primary music theme, which is widely described as one of the most recognizable cinematic themes of all time. Music scholar Joseph Cancellaro proposes that the two-note expression mimics the shark's heartbeat. According to Alexandre Tylski, like themes Bernard Herrmann wrote for \"Taxi Driver\", \"North by Northwest\", and particularly \"Mysterious Island\", it suggests human respiration. He further argues that the score's strongest motif is actually \"the split, the rupture\"\u2014when it dramatically cuts off, as after Chrissie's death. The relationship between sound and silence is also taken advantage of in the way the audience is conditioned to associate the shark with its theme, which is exploited toward the film's climax when the shark suddenly appears with no musical introduction.\nSpielberg later said that without Williams's score the film would have been only half as successful, and according to Williams it jumpstarted his career. He had previously scored Spielberg's debut feature, \"The Sugarland Express\", and went on to collaborate with the director on almost all of his films. The original soundtrack for \"Jaws\" was released by MCA Records on LP in 1975, and as a CD in 1992, including roughly a half hour of music that Williams redid for the album. In 2000, two versions of the score were released: Decca/Universal reissued the soundtrack album to coincide with the release of the 25th-anniversary DVD, featuring the entire 51 minutes of the original score, and Var\u00e8se Sarabande put out a rerecording of the score performed by the Royal Scottish National Orchestra, conducted by Joel McNeely.\nThemes.\nInfluences.\nHerman Melville's \"Moby-Dick\" is the most notable artistic antecedent to \"Jaws\". The character of Quint strongly resembles Captain Ahab, the obsessed captain of the \"Pequod\" who devotes his life to hunting a sperm whale. Quint's monologue reveals a similar obsession with sharks; even his boat, the \"Orca\", is named after the only natural enemy of the white shark. In the novel and original screenplay, Quint dies after being dragged under the ocean by a harpoon tied to his leg, similar to the death of Ahab in Melville's novel. A direct reference to these similarities may be found in Spielberg's draft of the screenplay, which introduces Quint watching the film version of \"Moby-Dick\"; his continuous laughter prompts other audience members to get up and leave the theater. However, the scene from \"Moby-Dick\" could not be licensed from the film's star, Gregory Peck, its copyright holder. Screenwriter Carl Gottlieb also drew comparisons to Ernest Hemingway's \"The Old Man and the Sea\": \"\"Jaws\" is\u00a0... a titanic struggle, like Melville or Hemingway.\"\nThe underwater scenes shot from the shark's point of view have been compared with passages in two 1950s horror films, \"Creature from the Black Lagoon\" and \"The Monster That Challenged the World\". Gottlieb named two science fiction productions from the same era as influences on how the shark was depicted, or not: \"The Thing from Another World\", which Gottlieb described as \"a great horror film where you only see the monster in the last reel\"; and \"It Came From Outer Space\", where \"the suspense was built up because the creature was always off-camera\". Those precedents helped Spielberg and Gottlieb to \"concentrate on showing the 'effects' of the shark rather than the shark itself\". Scholars such as Thomas Schatz have described how \"Jaws\" melds various genres while essentially being an action film and a thriller. Most is taken from horror, with the core of a nature-based monster movie while adding elements of a slasher film. The second half is both a buddy film in the interaction between the crew of the \"Orca\", and a supernatural horror based on the shark's depiction of a nearly Satanic menace. Ian Freer describes \"Jaws\" as an aquatic monster movie, citing the influence of earlier monster films such as \"King Kong\" and \"Godzilla\". Charles Derry, in 1977, also compared \"Jaws\" to \"Godzilla\"; and Spielberg cited \"Godzilla, King of the Monsters!\" (1956) as a formative influence growing up, due to the \"masterful\" way in which \"it made you believe it was really happening.\"\nCritics such as Neil Sinyard have described similarities to Henrik Ibsen's play \"An Enemy of the People\". Gottlieb himself said he and Spielberg referred to \"Jaws\" as \"\"Moby-Dick\" meets \"Enemy of the People\"\". The Ibsen work features a doctor who discovers that a seaside town's medicinal hot springs, a major tourist attraction and revenue source, are contaminated. When the doctor attempts to convince the townspeople of the danger, he loses his job and is shunned. This plotline is paralleled in \"Jaws\" by Brody's conflict with Mayor Vaughn, who refuses to acknowledge the presence of a shark that may dissuade summer beachgoers from coming to Amity. Brody is vindicated when more shark attacks occur at the crowded beach in broad daylight. Sinyard calls the film a \"deft combination of Watergate and Ibsen's play\".\nScholarly criticism.\n\"Jaws\" has received attention from academic critics. Stephen Heath relates the film's ideological meanings to the then-recent Watergate scandal. He argues that Brody represents the \"white male middle class\u2014[there is] not a single black and, very quickly, not a single woman in the film\", who restores public order \"with an ordinary-guy kind of heroism born of fear-and-decency\". Yet Heath moves beyond ideological content analysis to examine \"Jaws\" as a signal example of the film as \"industrial product\" that sells on the basis of \"the pleasure of cinema, thus yielding the perpetuation of the industry (which is why part of the meaning of \"Jaws\" is to be the most profitable movie)\".\nAndrew Britton contrasts the film to the novel's post-Watergate cynicism, suggesting that its narrative alterations from the book (Hooper's survival, the shark's explosive death) help make it \"a communal exorcism, a ceremony for the restoration of ideological confidence.\" He suggests that the experience of the film is \"inconceivable\" without the mass audience's jubilation when the shark is annihilated, signifying the obliteration of evil itself. In his view, Brody serves to demonstrate that \"individual action by the one just man is still a viable source for social change\". Peter Biskind argues that the film does maintain post-Watergate cynicism concerning politics and politicians insofar as the sole villain beside the shark is the town's venal mayor. Yet he observes that, far from the narrative formulas so often employed by New Hollywood filmmakers of the era\u2014involving Us vs. Them, hip counterculture figures vs. \"The Man\"\u2014the overarching conflict in \"Jaws\" does not pit the heroes against authority figures, but against a menace that targets everyone regardless of socioeconomic position.\nWhereas Britton states that the film avoids the novel's theme of social class conflicts on Amity Island, Biskind detects class divisions in the screen version and argues for their significance. \"Authority must be restored\", he writes, \"but not by Quint\". The seaman's \"working class toughness and bourgeois independence is alien and frightening\u00a0... irrational and out of control\". Hooper, meanwhile, is \"associated with technology rather than experience, inherited wealth rather than self-made sufficiency\"; he is marginalized from the conclusive action, if less terminally than Quint. Britton sees the film more as concerned with the \"vulnerability of children and the need to protect and guard them\", which in turn helps generate a \"pervasive sense of the supreme value of family life: a value clearly related to [ideological] stability and cultural continuity\".\nFredric Jameson's analysis highlights the polysemy of the shark and the multiple ways in which it can be and has been read\u2014from representing alien menaces such as communism or the Third World to more intimate dreads concerning the unreality of contemporary American life and the vain efforts to sanitize and suppress the knowledge of death. He asserts that its symbolic function is to be found in this very \"polysemousness which is profoundly ideological, insofar as it allows essentially social and historical anxieties to be folded back into apparently 'natural' ones\u00a0... to be recontained in what looks like a conflict with other forms of biological existence.\" He views Quint's demise as the symbolic overthrow of an old, populist, New Deal America and Brody and Hooper's partnership as an \"allegory of an alliance between the forces of law-and-order and the new technocracy of the multinational corporations\u00a0... in which the viewer rejoices without understanding that he or she is excluded from it.\"\nNeal Gabler analyzed the film as showing three different approaches to solving an obstacle: science (represented by Hooper), spiritualism (represented by Quint), and the common man (represented by Brody). The last of the three is the one which succeeds and is in that way endorsed by the film.\nAudience emotional response.\nWhile in theaters, the film was said to have caused a single case of cinematic neurosis in a 17-year-old female viewer. Cinematic neurosis is a condition in which viewers exhibit mental health disturbances, or a worsening of existing mental health disturbances, after viewing a film. The symptoms first presented as sleep disturbances and anxiety, but one day later the patient was screaming \"Sharks! Sharks!\" and experiencing convulsions.\nThis case study caused the film to become notable in the medical community alongside \"The Exorcist\" for causing stress reactions in its viewers, and was later used in a study by Brian R. Johnson to test how susceptible audiences were to cinematic stress inducers. His study found that stress could be induced by cinema in segments of the general population, and \"Jaws\" specifically caused stress reactions in its viewers. While Johnson could not find an exact cause for the stress response in viewers, whether it be the suspense, the gore or the music production, a 1986 study by G. Sparks found that particularly violent films, including \"Jaws\", tended to cause the most intense reactions in viewers.\nRelease.\nMarketing.\nUniversal spent $1.8 million marketing \"Jaws\", including an unprecedented $700,000 on national television spot advertising. The media blitz included about two dozen 30-second advertisements airing each night on prime-time network TV between June 18, 1975, and the film's opening two days later. Beyond that, in the description of film industry scholar Searle Kochberg, Universal \"devised and co-ordinated a highly innovative plan\" for the picture's marketing. As early as October 1974, Zanuck, Brown, and Benchley hit the television and radio talk show circuit to promote the paperback edition of the novel and the forthcoming film. The studio and publisher Bantam agreed on a title logo that would appear on both the paperback and in all of the advertising for the film. The centerpieces of the joint marketing strategy were John Williams's theme and the poster image featuring the shark approaching a lone female swimmer. The poster was based on the paperback's cover, and had the same artist, Bantam employee Roger Kastel. The Seiniger Advertising agency spent six months designing the poster; principal Tony Seiniger explained that \"no matter what we did, it didn't look scary enough\". Seiniger ultimately decided that \"you had to actually go underneath the shark so you could see his teeth.\"\nMore merchandise was created to take advantage of the film's release. In 1999, Graeme Turner wrote that \"Jaws\" was accompanied by what was \"probably the most elaborate array of tie-ins\" including \"a sound-track album, T-shirts, plastic tumblers, a book about the making of the movie, the book the movie was based on, beach towels, blankets, shark costumes, toy sharks, hobby kits, iron-on transfers, games, posters, shark's tooth necklaces, sleepwear, water pistols, and more.\" The Ideal Toy Company, for instance, produced \"The Game of Jaws\" in which the player had to use a hook to fish out items from the shark's mouth before the jaws closed.\nTheatrical run.\nThe glowing audience response to a rough cut of the film at two test screenings in Dallas on March 26, 1975, and one in Long Beach, on March 28, along with the success of Benchley's novel and the early stages of Universal's marketing campaign, generated great interest among theater owners, facilitating the studio's plan to debut \"Jaws\" at hundreds of cinemas simultaneously. A third and final preview screening, of a cut incorporating changes inspired by the previous presentations, was held in Hollywood on April 24. After Universal chairman Lew Wasserman attended one of the screenings, he ordered the film's initial release\u2014planned for a massive total of as many as 900 theaters\u2014to be cut down, declaring, \"I want this picture to run all summer long. I don't want people in Palm Springs to see the picture in Palm Springs. I want them to have to get in their cars and drive to see it in Hollywood.\" Nonetheless, the several hundred theaters that were still booked for the opening represented what was then an unusually wide release. At the time, wide openings were associated with movies of doubtful quality; not uncommon on the exploitation side of the industry, they were customarily employed to diminish the effect of negative reviews and word of mouth. There had been some recent exceptions, including the rerelease of \"Billy Jack\" and the original release of its sequel \"The Trial of Billy Jack\", the \"Dirty Harry\" sequel \"Magnum Force\", and the latest installments in the James Bond series. Still, the typical major studio film release at the time involved opening at a few big-city theaters, which allowed for a series of premieres. Distributors would then slowly forward prints to additional locales across the country, capitalizing on any positive critical or audience response. The outsized success of \"The Godfather\" in 1972 had sparked a trend toward wider releases, but even that film had debuted in just five theaters, before going wide in its second weekend.\nOn June 20, \"Jaws\" opened across North America on 464 screens\u2014409 in the United States, the remainder in Canada. The coupling of this broad distribution pattern with the movie's then even rarer national television marketing campaign yielded a release method virtually unheard-of at the time. (A month earlier, Columbia Pictures had done something similar with a Charles Bronson thriller, \"Breakout\", though that film's prospects for an extended run were much slimmer, and it is today a common misconception that \"Jaws\" was the first to use an ad saturation strategy.) Universal president Sid Sheinberg reasoned that nationwide marketing costs would be amortized at a more favorable rate per print relative to a slow, scaled release. Building on the film's success, the release was subsequently expanded on July 25 to nearly 700 theaters, and on August 15 to more than 950. Overseas distribution followed the same pattern, with intensive television campaigns and wide releases\u2014in Great Britain, for instance, \"Jaws\" opened in December at more than 100 theaters.\nFor its 40th anniversary, the film was released in selected theaters (across approximately 500 theaters) in the United States on Sunday, June 21, and Wednesday, June 24, 2015.\nAnother theatrical reissue was released on September 2, 2022, usually under the title \"Jaws in 3D\" (not to be confused with the second sequel, \"Jaws 3-D\") with the film debuting in both IMAX and RealD 3D formats, as part of the 40th anniversary celebration of another Spielberg film \"E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial\". On the announcement, Travis Reed of RealD 3D remarked: \"\"Jaws\" redefined what it means to be a summer-event blockbuster and now for the first time ever audiences can experience Steven Spielberg's motion picture classic in 3D ... allowing fans a completely new opportunity to immerse themselves in one of the greatest summer suspense thrillers of all time.\"\nFor the film's 50th anniversary, the 2025 TCM Classic Film Festival will hold a special screening, followed by a limited theatrical re-release from August 29 to September 4, 2025, alongside a celebratory exhibition at the Academy Museum of Motion Pictures in Los Angeles.\nReception.\nBox office.\n\"Jaws\" opened in 409 theaters with a record $7 million weekend and grossed a record $21,116,354 in its first 10 days recouping its production costs. It grossed $100 million in its first 59 days from 954 playdates. In just 78 days, it overtook \"The Godfather\" as the highest-grossing film at the North American box office, sailing past that picture's earnings of $86 million, and became the first film to earn $100 million in US theatrical rentals. It spent 14 consecutive weeks as the number-one film in the United States. Its initial release ultimately brought in $123.1 million in rentals. Theatrical re-releases in 1976 and the summer of 1979 brought its total rentals to $133.4 million.\nThe film entered overseas release in December 1975, and its international business mirrored its domestic performance. It broke records in Singapore, New Zealand, Japan, Spain, and Mexico. On January 11, 1976, \"Jaws\" became the highest-grossing film worldwide with rentals of $132 million, surpassing the $131 million earned by \"The Godfather\". By the time of the third film in 1983, \"Variety\" reported that it had earned worldwide rentals of $270 million. \"Jaws\" was the highest-grossing film of all time until \"Star Wars\", which debuted two years later. \"Star Wars\" surpassed \"Jaws\" for the U.S. record six months after its release and set a new global record in 1978. All told, \"Jaws\" grossed $260 million in United States and Canada, and $470 million worldwide across its various releases in the 1970s.\nAs of 2014, \"Jaws\" had sold 128 million tickets in the United States and Canada making it the seventh-highest-grossing movie of all time adjusted for ticket price inflation,\n and 243 million tickets globally. Its inflation-adjusted worldwide gross of $2 billion in 2011 made it the second-most successful franchise film after \"Star Wars\" at the time. In the United Kingdom it was the tenth highest-grossing film released between 1975 and 2018, earning the equivalent of over \u00a380 million in 2018 currency, with admissions estimated at 16.2 million. \"Jaws\" has also sold 13 million tickets in Brazil, a quantity first surpassed by \"Titanic\" in 1998, and that still ranks as the sixth most attended film in the country.\nOn August 29, 2025, \"Jaws\" was re-released for its 50th anniversary. In United States and Canada it earned $950,000 in Thursday night previews and $3,080,000 on Friday, It made $8.1 million for the three-day weekend, finishing second place at the weekend box office behind \"Weapons\", going on to earn $9.9 million over the four-day Labor Day weekend. As of \u00a018, 2025[ [update]], the 50th anniversary reissue has earned $12.8 million in United States and Canada, and $3.4 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $16.2 million.\nAcross all of its releases \"Jaws\" has grossed $280 million in United States and Canada and $ million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $495 million.\nCritical reception.\n\"Jaws\" received mostly positive reviews upon release. Roger Ebert of the \"Chicago Sun-Times\" gave the film four stars, calling it \"a sensationally effective action picture, a scary thriller that works all the better because it's populated with characters that have been developed into human beings. It's a film that's as frightening as \"The Exorcist\", and yet it's a nicer kind of fright, somehow more fun because we're being scared by an outdoor-adventure saga instead of a brimstone-and-vomit devil.\" \"Variety\"'s A. D. Murphy praised Spielberg's directorial skills, and called Robert Shaw's performance \"absolutely magnificent\". According to \"The New Yorker\"'s Pauline Kael, it was \"the most cheerfully perverse scare movie ever made\u00a0... [with] more zest than an early Woody Allen picture, a lot more electricity, [and] it's funny in a Woody Allen sort of way\". For \"New Times\" magazine, Frank Rich wrote, \"Spielberg is blessed with a talent that is absurdly absent from most American filmmakers these days: this man actually knows how to tell a story on screen.\u00a0... It speaks well of this director's gifts that some of the most frightening sequences in \"Jaws\" are those where we don't even see the shark.\" Writing for \"New York\" magazine, Judith Crist described the film as \"an exhilarating adventure entertainment of the highest order\" and complimented its acting and \"extraordinary technical achievements\". Rex Reed praised the \"nerve-frying\" action scenes and concluded that \"for the most part, \"Jaws\" is a gripping horror film that works beautifully in every department\". David Thomson wrote that \"like Coppola on \"The Godfather\", Spielberg asserted his own role and deftly organized the elements of a roller coaster entertainment without sacrificing inner meanings. The suspense of the picture came from meticulous technique and good humor about its own surgical cutting. You have only to submit to the travesty of \"Jaws 2\" to realize how much more engagingly Spielberg saw the ocean, the perils, the sinister beauty of the shark, and the vitality of its human opponents.\"\nVincent Canby of \"The New York Times\" wrote, \"It's a measure of how the film operates that not once do we feel particular sympathy for any of the shark's victims.\u00a0... In the best films, characters are revealed in terms of the action. In movies like \"Jaws\", characters are simply functions of the action\u00a0... like stage hands who move props around and deliver information when it's necessary\". He did describe it as \"the sort of nonsense that can be a good deal of fun\". \"Los Angeles Times\" critic Charles Champlin disagreed with the film's PG rating, saying that \"\"Jaws\" is too gruesome for children, and likely to turn the stomach of the impressionable at any age.\u00a0... It is a coarse-grained and exploitative work which depends on excess for its impact. Ashore it is a bore, awkwardly staged and lumpily written.\" Marcia Magill of \"Films in Review\" said that while \"Jaws\" \"is eminently worth seeing for its second half\", she felt that before the protagonists' pursuit of the shark the film was \"often flawed by its busyness\". William S. Pechter of \"Commentary\" described \"Jaws\" as \"a mind-numbing repast for sense-sated gluttons\" and \"filmmaking of this essentially manipulative sort\"; Molly Haskell of \"The Village Voice\" similarly characterized it as a \"scare machine that works with computer-like precision.\u00a0... You feel like a rat, being given shock therapy\". The most frequently criticized aspect of the film has been the artificiality of its mechanical antagonist: Magill declared that \"the programmed shark has one truly phony close-up\", and in 2002, online reviewer James Berardinelli said that if not for Spielberg's deftly suspenseful direction, \"we would be doubled over with laughter at the cheesiness of the animatronic creature.\" \"Halliwell's Film Guide\" stated that \"despite genuinely suspenseful and frightening sequences, it is a slackly narrated and sometimes flatly handled thriller with an over-abundance of dialogue and, when it finally appears, a pretty unconvincing monster.\"\nAccolades.\n\"Jaws\" won three Academy Awards, those being for Best Film Editing, Best Original Dramatic Score, and Best Sound (Robert Hoyt, Roger Heman, Earl Madery, and John Carter). It was also nominated for Best Picture, losing to \"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\". Spielberg greatly resented the fact that he was not nominated for Best Director.\nAlong with the Academy Award, John Williams and his score won the Grammy Award, the BAFTA Award for Best Film Music, and the Golden Globe Award. To her Academy Award, Verna Fields added the American Cinema Editors' Eddie Award for Best Edited Feature Film. The film was voted Favorite Movie at the People's Choice Awards.\nIt was also nominated for Best Film, Director, Actor (Richard Dreyfuss), Screenplay, Editing and Sound at the 29th British Academy Film Awards, and Best Motion Picture\u2013Drama, Director and Screenplay at the 33rd Golden Globe Awards. Spielberg was nominated by the Directors Guild of America for the DGA Award, and the Writers Guild of America nominated Peter Benchley and Carl Gottlieb's script for Best Adapted Drama.\nHome media and television.\nThe first ever LaserDisc title marketed in North America was the MCA DiscoVision release of \"Jaws\" in 1978. A second LaserDisc was released in 1992, before a third and final version came out under MCA/Universal Home Video's Signature Collection imprint in 1995. This release was an elaborate box-set that included deleted scenes and outtakes, a new two-hour documentary on the making of the film directed and produced by Laurent Bouzereau, a copy of the novel \"Jaws\", and a CD of the soundtrack by John Williams.\nOn television, ABC aired it for the first time on November 4, 1979, right after its theatrical re-release. The first U.S. broadcast received a Nielsen rating of 39.1 and attracted 57 percent of the total audience, the second-highest televised movie audience at the time behind \"Gone with the Wind\" and the fourth-highest rated. In the United Kingdom, 23 million people watched its inaugural broadcast in October 1981, the second-biggest British TV audience ever for a feature film behind \"Live and Let Die\".\nMCA Home Video first released \"Jaws\" on VHS in 1980. For the film's 20th anniversary in 1995, MCA Universal Home Video issued a new Collector's Edition tape featuring a making-of retrospective. This release sold 800,000 units in North America. Another, final VHS release, marking the film's 25th anniversary in 2000, came with a companion tape containing a documentary, deleted scenes, outtakes, and a trailer.\n\"Jaws\" was first released on DVD in 2000 for the film's 25th anniversary, accompanied by a massive publicity campaign. It featured a 50-minute documentary on the making of the film (an edited version of that featured on the 1995 LaserDisc release), with interviews with Spielberg, Scheider, Dreyfuss, Benchley, and other cast and crew members. Other extras included deleted scenes, outtakes, trailers, production photos, and storyboards. The DVD shipped one million copies in just one month. In June 2005, a 30th anniversary edition was released at the JawsFest festival on Martha's Vineyard. The new DVD had many extras seen in previous home video releases, including the full two-hour Bouzereau documentary, and a previously unavailable interview with Spielberg conducted on the set of \"Jaws\" in 1974. On the second JawsFest in August 2012, the Blu-ray disc of \"Jaws\" was released, with over four hours of extras, including \"The Shark Is Still Working\". The Blu-ray release was part of the celebrations of Universal's 100th anniversary, and debuted at fourth place in the charts, with over 362,000 units sold. The film was released on 4K Ultra HD Blu-ray (4K UHD) for its 45th anniversary on June 2, 2020; it was re-released on 4K UHD for its 50th anniversary on June 17, 2025, with a new Bouzereau-directed documentary, \"\".\nLegacy.\nImpact on the film industry.\n\"Jaws\" was key in establishing the benefits of a wide national release backed by heavy television advertising, rather than the traditional progressive release in which a film slowly entered new markets and built support over time. Saturation booking, in which a film opens simultaneously at thousands of theaters, and massive media buys are now commonplace for the major Hollywood studios. According to Peter Biskind, \"Jaws\" \"diminished the importance of print reviews, making it virtually impossible for a film to build slowly, finding its audience by dint of mere quality. ... Moreover, \"Jaws\" whet corporate appetites for big profits quickly, which is to say, studios wanted every film to be \"Jaws\".\" Scholar Thomas Schatz writes that it \"recalibrated the profit potential of the Hollywood hit, and redefined its status as a marketable commodity and cultural phenomenon as well. The film brought an emphatic end to Hollywood's five-year recession, while ushering in an era of high-cost, high-tech, high-speed thrillers.\"\n\"Jaws\" also played a major part in establishing summer as the prime season for the release of studios' biggest box-office contenders, their intended blockbusters; winter had long been the time when most hoped-for hits were distributed, while summer was largely reserved for dumping films thought likely to be poor performers. \"Jaws\" and \"Star Wars\" are regarded as marking the beginning of the new U.S. film industry business model dominated by \"high-concept\" pictures\u2014with premises that can be easily described and marketed\u2014as well as the beginning of the end of the New Hollywood period, which saw auteur films increasingly disregarded in favor of profitable big-budget pictures. The New Hollywood era was defined by the relative autonomy filmmakers were able to attain within the major studio system; in Biskind's description, \"Spielberg was the Trojan horse through which the studios began to reassert their power.\"\n\"Jaws\" set the template for many subsequent horror films, to the extent that the script for Ridley Scott's 1979 science fiction film \"Alien\" was pitched to studio executives as \"\"Jaws\" in space\". Many films based on man-eating animals, usually aquatic, were released through the 1970s and 1980s, such as \"Orca\", \"Grizzly\", \"\", \"Barracuda\", \"Alligator\", \"Day of the Animals\", \"Tintorera\", and \"Eaten Alive\". Spielberg declared \"Piranha\", directed by Joe Dante and written by John Sayles, \"the best of the \"Jaws\" ripoffs\". Among the various foreign mockbusters based on \"Jaws\", three came from Italy: \"Great White\", which inspired a plagiarism lawsuit by Universal and was even marketed in some countries as a part of the \"Jaws\" franchise; \"Monster Shark\", featured in \"Mystery Science Theater 3000\" under the title \"Devil Fish\"; and \"Deep Blood\", which blends in a supernatural element. The 1976 Brazilian film \"Bacalhau\" parodies \"Jaws\", featuring a killer cod in place of a shark. The 2009 Japanese horror film \"Psycho Shark\" was released in the United States as \"Jaws in Japan\". Filmmaker Takashi Yamazaki cited \"Jaws\" and Spielberg as an influence for his 2023 Japanese \"kaiju\" film \"Godzilla Minus One\". That same year, filmmaker Denis Villeneuve named it one of his favorite films of all time, citing it as among his influences for his 2021 adaptation of \"Dune\".\nMisconceptions about sharks and depopulation.\nThe film had broader cultural repercussions as well. Similar to the way the pivotal scene in 1960's \"Psycho\" made showers a new source of anxiety, \"Jaws\" led many viewers to fear going into the ocean. Some even questioned whether sharks could be in Lake Michigan. Reduced beach attendance in 1975 was attributed to it, as well as more reported shark sightings.\nIt is still seen as responsible for perpetuating negative stereotypes about sharks and their behavior, and for producing the so-called \"\"Jaws\" effect\", which allegedly inspired \"legions of fishermen [who] piled into boats and killed thousands of the ocean predators in shark-fishing tournaments.\" Benchley would later campaign to stop the depopulation of sharks, saying that \"\"Jaws\" was entirely a fiction\". Spielberg later echoed this sentiment, saying that he regretted \"the decimation of the shark population because of the book and the film\". Conservation groups have bemoaned the fact that the film has made it considerably harder to convince the public that sharks should be protected.\nRankings.\nIn the years since its release, \"Jaws\" has frequently been cited by film critics and industry professionals as one of the greatest movies of all time. It was number 48 on American Film Institute's \"100 Years ... 100 Movies\", a list of the greatest American films of all time compiled in 1998; it dropped to number 56 on the 10th Anniversary list. AFI also ranked the shark at number 18 on its list of the 50 Best Villains, Roy Scheider's line \"You're gonna need a bigger boat\" 35th on a list of top 100 movie quotes, Williams's score at sixth on a list of 100 Years of Film Scores, and the film as second on a list of 100 most thrilling films, behind only \"Psycho\". In 2003, \"The New York Times\" included the film on its list of the best 1,000 movies ever made. The following year, \"Jaws\" placed at the top of the Bravo network's five-hour miniseries \"The 100 Scariest Movie Moments\". The Chicago Film Critics Association named it the sixth-scariest film ever made in 2006. In 2008, \"Jaws\" was ranked the fifth-greatest film in history by \"Empire\" magazine, which also placed Quint at number 50 on its list of the 100 Greatest Movie Characters of All Time. The film has been cited in many other lists of 50 and 100 greatest films, including ones compiled by Leonard Maltin, \"Entertainment Weekly\", \"Film4\", \"Rolling Stone\", \"Total Film\", \"TV Guide\", \"Vanity Fair\" and \"Variety\".\nIn 2001, the United States Library of Congress selected it for preservation in the National Film Registry, recognizing it as a landmark horror film and the first \"summer movie\". In 2006, its screenplay was ranked the 63rd-best of all time by the Writers Guild of America. In 2012, the Motion Picture Editors Guild listed the film as the eighth best-edited film of all time based on a survey of its membership.\nAdaptations.\nThe film has inspired two theme park rides: one at Universal Studios Florida, which closed in January 2012, and one at Universal Studios Japan. There is also an animatronic version of a scene from the film on the Studio Tour at Universal Studios Hollywood.\nSeveral video games have been based on the film: 1987's \"Jaws\", developed by LJN for the Nintendo Entertainment System; 2006's \"Jaws Unleashed\" by Majesco Entertainment for the Xbox, PlayStation 2, and PC; and 2011's \"Jaws: Ultimate Predator\", also by Majesco, for the Nintendo 3DS and Wii. In 2009, an officially licensed slot machine premiered, and in 2010, a mobile game was released for the iPhone.\nIn 2017, video game developer Zen Studios released a virtual pinball adaptation of the film as part of the Universal Classics add-on pack for the virtual pinball game \"Pinball FX 3\". This table features 3D figures of Quint and Jaws, with the opportunity to play missions from either character's perspective. This table was remastered for \"Pinball FX\" on March 31, 2022. Stern Pinball produced a physical \"Jaws\"-themed pinball cabinet in 2024.\nThe film has inspired two musical adaptations: \"JAWS: The Musical!\" (2002) and \"\", which premiered in 2006 at the Toronto Fringe Festival.\nLego released a set based on the scene where Bruce attacks the Orca with Chief Martin Brody, Matt Hooper, and Sam Quint. The set was released in August 2024 and features 1,497 pieces.\nTributes.\nRichard Dreyfuss made a cameo appearance in the 2010 film \"Piranha 3D\", a loose remake of the 1978 original. Dreyfuss plays Matt Boyd, a fisherman who is the first victim of the title creatures. Dreyfuss later stated that his character was a parody and a near-reincarnation of Matt Hooper, his character in \"Jaws\". During his appearance, Dreyfuss's character listens to the song \"Show Me the Way to Go Home\" on the radio, which Hooper, Quint and Brody sing together aboard the \"Orca\".\nPrimary filming location Martha's Vineyard celebrated the film's 30th anniversary in 2005 with a \"JawsFest\" festival, which had a second edition in 2012.\nAn independent group of fans produced the feature-length documentary \"The Shark Is Still Working\", featuring interviews with the film's cast and crew. Narrated by Roy Scheider and dedicated to Peter Benchley, who died in 2006, it debuted at the 2009 Los Angeles United Film Festival.\nA few months after the film's release in 1975, musician Dickie Goodman released \"Mr. Jaws\", a novelty song that parodied \"Jaws\" by featuring mock interviews with the film's characters, including the shark, the titular \"Mr. Jaws\". The break-in record was a minor hit that autumn, peaking at #4 on the Billboard Hot 100 in October 1975. In 2013, Lemon Demon, the musical project of artist Neil Cicierega, released the song \"Jaws\", which humorously retells the events of the film with increasing exaggerations. \"Jaws\" was the final single for Lemon Demon's 2014 extended play \"Nature Tapes\", which compiled several previously released songs.\nRobert Shaw's son, Ian Shaw, co-wrote and starred as his father in the play \"The Shark Is Broken\" about the making of \"Jaws\", which premiered at the Edinburgh Fringe in 2019 and transferred to the West End in October 2021.\nThe musical \"Bruce\", based on Carl Gottlieb's book \"The Jaws Log\", had its world premiere at the Seattle Rep theatre from May 27 to July 3, 2022. The musical covers the difficulties Spielberg encountered making the movie, including the ongoing issues with the titular mechanical shark.\nOn November 20, 2020, a replica of Bruce the mechanical shark was lifted into place at the Academy Museum of Motion Pictures. The replica, which had been created from the film mold after the original three sharks were destroyed, was on display for 15 years at Universal Studios Hollywood before spending 25 years in a Sun Valley junkyard, until the owner donated the shark to the museum in 2016.\nIn July 2025, San Diego Comic-Con hosted a panel celebrating the 50th anniversary of the film's release with panelists Chris Gore, Fangoria critic Steph Cannon, Pat Jankiewicz, \"Jaws\" memorabilia collector Chris Kiszka, and moderator Mark Atkinson.\nSequels.\n\"Jaws\" spawned three sequels to declining critical favor and commercial performance. Their combined domestic grosses amount to barely half of the first film's. In October 1975, Spielberg declared to a film festival audience that \"making a sequel to anything is just a cheap carny trick\". Nonetheless, he did consider taking on the first sequel when its original director, John D. Hancock, was fired a few days into the shoot; ultimately, his obligations to \"Close Encounters of the Third Kind\", which he was working on with Dreyfuss, made it impossible. \"Jaws 2\" (1978) was eventually directed by Jeannot Szwarc, with Scheider, Gary, Hamilton, and Jeffrey Kramer reprising their roles. It is generally regarded as the best of the sequels.\n\"Jaws 3-D\" (1983) does not feature any of the original actors, although it was directed by Joe Alves, who had served as art director and production designer, respectively, on the two preceding films. Starring Dennis Quaid and Louis Gossett Jr., it was released to heavily negative reviews in 3D format. The effect did not transfer to television or home video, where it was renamed \"Jaws 3\". \"\" (1987) was directed by Joseph Sargent, co-starred Michael Caine, and featured the return of Lorraine Gary as Ellen Brody. \"Entertainment Weekly\" listed it among the worst sequels ever made.\nWhile all three sequels made a profit at the box office (\"Jaws 2\" and \"Jaws 3-D\" were among the top 20 highest-grossing films of their respective years), critics and audiences alike were largely dissatisfied with the films.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He participated in the conquest of Cuba, in Juan de Grijalva's exploration of the coasts of the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula and the Gulf of Mexico, and in the conquest of the Aztec Empire led by Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s. He is considered the conquistador of much of Central America, including Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, and parts of Nicaragua.\nWhile a great warrior, Alvarado developed a reputation for greed and cruelty, and was accused of various crimes and abuses by natives and Spaniards alike. In 1541, Alvarado was crushed by a horse while attempting to quell a native revolt in Mexico, dying a few days later.\nCharacter and appearance.\nPedro de Alvarado was flamboyant and charismatic, and was both a brilliant military commander and a cruel, hardened man. He is described as having \"good features and bearing\", and when presented with a picture of him, the Aztecs referred to him as T\u014dnatiuh. The Aztecs gave Alvarado this name because of his blond hair, and also his infamous temper. He was handsome, and presented an affable appearance, but was volatile and quick to anger.\nHe was ruthless in his dealings with the indigenous peoples he set out to conquer. Historians judge that his greed drove him to excessive cruelty, and his Spanish contemporaries denounced his extreme brutality during his lifetime. He was a poor governor of territories he had conquered, and restlessly sought out new adventures.\nHis tactical brutality, such as the massacre in the Great Temple of Tenochtitlan, often undermined strategic considerations. He was also accused of cruelty against fellow Spaniards. Alvarado was little suited to govern; when he held governing positions, he did little to establish stable foundations for colonial rule. His letters show no interest in civil matters, and he discussed only exploration and war. Alvarado stubbornly resisted attempts by the Spanish Crown to establish ordered taxation in Guatemala, and refused to acknowledge such attempts. As governor of Guatemala, Alvarado has been described by W. George Lovell et al. as \"an insatiable despot who recognized no authority but his own and who regarded Guatemala as little more than his personal estate.\"\nAmerican historian William H. Prescott described Alvarado's character in the following terms:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Alvarado was a cavalier of high family, gallant and chivalrous, and [Cortes'] warm personal friend. He had talents for action, was possessed of firmness and intrepidity, while his frank and dazzling manners made the Tonatiuh an especial favourite with the Mexicans. But, underneath this showy exterior, the future conqueror of Guatemala concealed a heart rash, rapacious, and cruel. He was altogether destitute of that moderation, which, in the delicate position he occupied, was a quality of more worth than all the rest.\u2014\u200a\nSpanish chronicler Antonio de Remesal commented that \"Alvarado desired more to be feared than loved by his subjects, whether they were Indians or Spaniards.\" In his easy recourse to violence, Alvarado was a product of his time, and Alvarado was not the only \"conquistador\" to have resorted to such actions. Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s and Francisco Pizarro carried out deeds of similar cruelty, but have not attracted as much criticism as Alvarado.\nEarly life and family.\nPedro de Alvarado was born in 1485 in the town of Badajoz, Extremadura. His father was G\u00f3mez de Alvarado, and his mother was Leonor de Contreras, G\u00f3mez's second wife. Pedro de Alvarado had a twin sister, Sarra, and four full-blood brothers, Jorge, Gonzalo, G\u00f3mez, and Juan. Pedro had an illegitimate half brother, also named Juan, referred to in contemporary sources as \"Juan el Bastardo\".\nVery little is known of Pedro de Alvarado's early life before his arrival in the Americas. During the conquest of the Americas, tales of his youthful exploits in Spain became popular legends, but their veracity is doubtful. An example is the tale then current that when he was a youth awaiting passage to the Americas, he climbed the church tower in Seville with some friends. A banner pole extended some from an upper window. One of his companions walked out to the end of the pole after removing his cloak and sword, and returned to the tower backwards. Alvarado, afraid of being mocked, walked out onto the pole with both sword and cloak, and turned around at the end to return to the tower facing it.\nAlvarado's paternal grandfather was Juan Alvarado \"el Viejo\" (\"the elder\"), who was \"comendador\" of Hornachos, and his paternal grandmother was Catalina Mess\u00eda. Pedro de Alvarado's uncle on his father's side was Diego de Alvarado y Mess\u00eda, who was the \"comendador\" of Lob\u00f3n, Puebla, and Montijo, \"alcalde\" of Mont\u00e1nchez, and lord of Castellanos and of Cubillana. Diego was a veteran of the campaigns against the Moors.\nFirst campaigns in the Americas.\nAlvarado and his brothers crossed the Atlantic Ocean before 1511, possibly in 1510. By 1511 a system of licenses had been established in Spain to control the flow of colonists to the New World. The only one of the Alvarado brothers who appears in the registers is Juan de Alvarado, in 1511, leading to the assumption that the rest were already in the Americas by the time the licensing system was established. The Alvarado brothers stopped off at Hispaniola, but there are few mentions of their stay there in historical documents.\nSoon after arriving in Santo Domingo, on Hispaniola, Pedro de Alvarado established a friendship with Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s, who at the time was serving as public scribe. Alvarado joined Cort\u00e9s to participate in the conquest of Cuba, under the command of Diego de Vel\u00e1zquez. The conquest of Cuba was launched in 1511, and Pedro de Alvarado was accompanied by his brothers. Soon after the invasion, Alvarado was managing a prosperous \"hacienda\" in the new colony. It is around this time that Pedro de Alvarado emerges into the historical record as a prosperous and influential \"hacienda\"-owner, already well connected with Vel\u00e1zquez, who was now governor of Cuba.\nGrijalva expedition, 1518.\nDiego Vel\u00e1zquez, the governor of Cuba, was enthused by Francisco Hern\u00e1ndez de C\u00f3rdoba's report of gold in the newly discovered Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula. He organised an expedition consisting of four ships and 260 men. He placed his nephew Juan de Grijalva in overall command; Pedro de Alvarado captained one of the ships. The small fleet was stocked with crossbows, muskets, barter goods, salted pork and cassava bread.\nThe fleet left Cuba in April 1518, and made its first landfall upon the island of Cozumel, off the east coast of Yucat\u00e1n. The Maya inhabitants of Cozumel fled the Spanish; the fleet then sailed south from Cozumel, along the east coast of the peninsula. The Spanish spotted three large Maya cities along the coast. On Ascension Thursday the fleet discovered a large bay, which the Spanish named Bah\u00eda de la Ascensi\u00f3n.\nGrijalva did not land at any of these cities and turned back north to loop around the north of the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula and sail down the west coast. At Campeche the Spanish opened fire against the city with small cannon; the inhabitants fled, allowing the Spanish to take the abandoned city. The Maya remained hidden in the forest, so the Spanish boarded their ships and continued along the coast.\nAt Champot\u00f3n, the fleet was approached by a small number of large war canoes, but the ships' cannon soon put them to flight. At the mouth of the Tabasco River the Spanish sighted massed warriors and canoes but the natives did not approach. By means of interpreters, Grijalva indicated that he wished to trade and bartered wine and beads in exchange for food and other supplies. From the natives they received a few gold trinkets and news of the riches of the Aztec Empire to the west. The expedition continued far enough to confirm the reality of the gold-rich empire, sailing as far north as P\u00e1nuco River.\nAt the Papaloapan River, Alvarado ordered his ship upriver, leaving the rest of the small fleet behind to wait for him at the river mouth. This action greatly angered Grijalva, who feared that a lone ship could be lost. After this, the Spanish referred to the river as the \"R\u00edo de Alvarado\" (\"Alvarado's River\"). A little further along the coast, the fleet encountered settlements under Aztec dominion, and was met by Aztec emissaries with gifts of gold and jewels sent by the Emperor Moctezuma II.\nAs punishment for entering the Papaloapan River without orders, Grijalva sent Alvarado with the ship \"San Sebasti\u00e1n\" to relay news of the discoveries back to Cuba. Alvarado made a triumphal entry to Santiago de Cuba, with a great display of the wealth that had been gained from the expedition. His early arrival in Cuba allowed him to ingratiate himself with the Governor Vel\u00e1zquez before Grijalva's return. The rest of the fleet put into the port of Havana five months after it had left. Grijalva was coldly received by the governor, who Alvarado had turned against him, claiming much of the glory of the expedition for himself.\nExpedition to Mexico, 1519.\nGrijalva's return aroused great interest in Cuba. A new expedition was organised, with a fleet of eleven ships carrying 500 men and some horses. Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s was placed in command; Pedro de Alvarado and his brothers Jorge, G\u00f3mez and Juan \"El Bastardo\" joined the expedition. Cort\u00e9s charged Pedro de Alvarado with gathering recruits from the inland estates of Cuba. The crew included officers that would become famous conquistadors, including Crist\u00f3bal de Olid, Gonzalo de Sandoval and Diego de Ordaz. Also aboard were Francisco de Montejo and Bernal D\u00edaz del Castillo, veterans of the Grijalva expedition.\nAlvarado once again commanded the \"San Sebasti\u00e1n\", with 60 men under his orders. The fleet made its first landfall at Cozumel, and remained there for several days. Maya temples were cast down and a Christian cross was put up on one of them. From Cozumel, the fleet looped around the north of the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula and followed the coast to the Tabasco River. In Tabasco, the fleet anchored at Potonch\u00e1n, a Chontal Maya town. The Maya prepared for battle but the Spanish horses and firearms quickly decided the outcome. From Potonch\u00e1n, the fleet continued to San Juan de Ulua. The crew stayed only a short time before relocating to a promontory near Quiahuiztlan and Cempoala, a subject city of the Aztec Empire. Some of the Spaniards stayed near the coast when Cort\u00e9s journeyed inland but Alvarado accompanied Cort\u00e9s on the inland march. While marching toward Tenochtitlan, the expedition made a slight detour to travel through Tlaxcalteca lands. The Tlaxcalteca attacked the Spanish force numerous times but they were unable to rout the Spanish forces. After making an alliance with the Tlaxcalteca, the Spanish went on to conquer the Aztecs.\nAlvarado commanded one of the eleven vessels in the fleet and also acted as Cort\u00e9s' second in command during the expedition's first stay in the Aztec capital city of Tenochtitl\u00e1n. Relations between the Spaniards and their hosts were uneasy, especially given Cort\u00e9s' repeated insistence that the Aztecs desist from idol worship and human sacrifice; in order to ensure their own safety, the Spaniards took the Aztec king Moctezuma hostage. When Cort\u00e9s returned to the Gulf coast to deal with the newly arrived hostile expedition of P\u00e1nfilo de Narv\u00e1ez, Alvarado remained in Tenochtitlan as commander of the Spanish enclave, with strict orders to make sure that Moctezuma not be permitted to escape.\nDuring Cort\u00e9s' absence, relations between the Spaniards and their hosts went from bad to worse, and Alvarado perpetrated the Massacre in the Great Temple, killing Aztec nobles and priests observing a religious festival. Alvarado claims he did so because he feared the Aztecs were plotting against him but there is no physical evidence to support this claim and the alleged warnings he received came from tortured captives that very likely would have said anything to make the torture stop. When Cort\u00e9s returned to Tenochtitlan, he found the Spanish force under siege. After Moctezuma was killed in the attempt to negotiate with his own people, the Spaniards determined to escape by fighting their way across one of the causeways that led from the city across the lake and to the mainland. In a bloody nocturnal action of 10 July 1520, known as La Noche Triste, Alvarado led the rear-guard and was badly wounded. According to satirical verses by Gonzalo Ocampo, in reference to Alvarado crossing a causeway gap during the escape, Alvarado's escape became known as \"Salto de Alvarado\" (\"Alvarado's Leap\").\nPedro then participated in the Siege of Tenochtitlan, commanding one of four forces under Cort\u00e9s. Alvarado was wounded when Cuauhtemoc attacked all three Spanish camps on the feast day of St. John. Alvarado's company was the first to make it to the Tlateloco marketplace, setting fire to the Aztec shrines. Cort\u00e9s' and Sandoval's companies joined him there after four more days of fighting.\nConquest of Soconusco and Guatemala.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n...\u00a0we waited until they came close enough to shoot their arrows, and then we smashed into them; as they had never seen horses, they grew very fearful, and we made a good advance\u00a0... and many of them died.\nPedro de Alvarado describing the approach to Quetzaltenango in his 3rd letter to Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s\nCort\u00e9s despatched Pedro de Alvarado to invade Guatemala with 180 cavalry, 300 infantry, crossbows, muskets, 4 cannons, large amounts of ammunition and gunpowder, and thousands of allied Mexican warriors. Pedro de Alvarado passed through Soconusco with a sizeable force in 1523, en route to conquer Guatemala. Alvarado's army included hardened veterans of the conquest of the Aztecs, and included cavalry and artillery; there were also a great many indigenous allies from Cholula, Tenochtitlan, Texcoco, Tlaxcala, and Xochimilco.\nAlvarado was received in peace in Soconusco, and the inhabitants swore allegiance to the Spanish Crown. They reported that neighbouring groups in Guatemala were attacking them because of their friendly outlook towards the Spanish. Alvarado's letter to Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s describing his passage through Soconusco is lost, and knowledge of events there come from the account of Bernal D\u00edaz del Castillo, who was not present, but related the report of Gonzalo de Alvarado. By 1524, Soconusco had been completely pacified by Alvarado and his forces.\nPedro de Alvarado and his army advanced along the Pacific coast unopposed until they reached the Samal\u00e1 River in western Guatemala. This region formed a part of the K'iche' kingdom, and a K'iche' army tried unsuccessfully to prevent the Spanish from crossing the river. Once across, the conquistadors ransacked nearby settlements in an effort to terrorise the K'iche'. On 8 February 1524 Alvarado's army fought a battle at Xetulul, called Zapotitl\u00e1n by his Mexican allies (modern San Francisco Zapotitl\u00e1n). Although suffering many injuries inflicted by defending K'iche' archers, the Spanish and their allies stormed the town and set up camp in the marketplace.\nAlvarado then turned to head upriver into the Sierra Madre mountains towards the K'iche' heartlands, crossing the pass into the fertile valley of Quetzaltenango. On 12 February 1524 Alvarado's Mexican allies were ambushed in the pass and driven back by K'iche' warriors but the Spanish cavalry charge that followed was a shock for the K'iche', who had never before seen horses. The cavalry scattered the K'iche' and the army crossed to the city of Xelaju (modern Quetzaltenango) only to find it deserted.\nAlmost a week later, on 18 February 1524, a K'iche' army confronted the Spanish army in the Quetzaltenango valley and were comprehensively defeated; many K'iche' nobles were among the dead. This battle exhausted the K'iche' militarily and they asked for peace and offered tribute, inviting Pedro de Alvarado into their capital Q'umarkaj, which was known as Tecpan Utatlan to the Nahuatl-speaking allies of the Spanish. Alvarado was deeply suspicious of the K'iche' intentions but accepted the offer and marched to Q'umarkaj with his army.\nIn March 1524 Pedro de Alvarado entered Q'umarkaj at the invitation of the remaining lords of the K'iche' after their catastrophic defeat, fearing that he was entering a trap. He encamped on the plain outside the city rather than accepting lodgings inside. Fearing the great number of K'iche' warriors gathered outside the city and that his cavalry would not be able to manoeuvre in the narrow streets of Q'umarkaj, he invited the leading lords of the city, Oxib-Keh (the king) and Beleheb-Tzy (the king elect) to visit him in his camp.\nAs soon as they did so, he seized them and kept them as prisoners in his camp. The K'iche' warriors, seeing their lords taken prisoner, attacked the Spaniards' indigenous allies and managed to kill one of the Spanish soldiers. At this point Alvarado decided to have the captured K'iche' lords burnt to death, and then proceeded to burn the entire city. After the destruction of Q'umarkaj and the execution of its rulers, Pedro de Alvarado sent messages to Iximche, capital of the Kaqchikel, proposing an alliance against the remaining K'iche' resistance.\nKaqchikel alliance and conquest of the Tz'utujil.\nOn 14 April 1524, soon after the defeat of the K'iche', the Spanish were invited into Iximche and were well received by the lords Belehe Qat and Cahi Imox. The Kaqchikel kings provided native soldiers to assist the conquistadors against continuing K'iche' resistance and to help with the defeat of the neighbouring Tz'utuhil kingdom. The Spanish only stayed briefly in Iximche before continuing through Atitl\u00e1n, Escuintla and Cuscatl\u00e1n. The Spanish returned to the Kaqchikel capital on 23 July 1524 and on 27 July, Pedro de Alvarado declared Iximche as the first capital of Guatemala, Santiago de los Caballeros de Guatemala (\"St. James of the Knights of Guatemala\").\nThe Kaqchikel appear to have entered into an alliance with the Spanish to defeat their enemies, the Tz'utujil, whose capital was Tecpan Atitlan. Pedro de Alvarado sent two Kaqchikel messengers to Tecpan Atitlan at the request of the Kaqchikel lords, both of whom were killed by the Tz'utujil. When news of the killing of the messengers reached the Spanish at Iximche, the conquistadors marched against the Tz'utujil with their Kaqchikel allies.\nPedro de Alvarado left Iximche just 5 days after he had arrived there, with 60 cavalry, 150 Spanish infantry and an unspecified number of Kaqchikel warriors. The Spanish and their allies arrived at the lakeshore after a day's hard march, without encountering any opposition. Seeing the lack of resistance, Alvarado rode ahead with 30 cavalry along the lake shore. Opposite a populated island the Spanish at last encountered hostile Tz'utujil warriors and charged among them, scattering and pursuing them to a narrow causeway across which the surviving Tz'utujil fled. The rest of Alvarado's army soon reinforced his party and they successfully stormed the island. This battle took place on 18 April.\nThe following day the Spanish entered Tecpan Atitlan but found it deserted. Pedro de Alvarado camped in the centre of the city and sent out scouts to find the enemy. They managed to catch some locals and used them to send messages to the Tz'utujil lords, ordering them to submit to the king of Spain. The Tz'utujil leaders responded by surrendering to Pedro de Alvarado and swearing loyalty to Spain, at which point Alvarado considered them pacified and returned to Iximche. Three days after Pedro de Alvarado returned to Iximche, the lords of the Tz'utujil arrived there to pledge their loyalty and offer tribute to the conquistadors. A short time afterwards a number of lords arrived from the Pacific lowlands to swear allegiance to the king of Spain.\nKaqchikel rebellion.\nPedro de Alvarado rapidly began to demand gold in tribute from the Kaqchikels, souring the friendship between the two peoples. He demanded that their kings deliver 1000 gold leaves, each worth 15 pesos. The Kaqchikel people abandoned their city and fled to the forests and hills on 28 August 1524. Ten days later the Spanish declared war on the Kaqchikel.\nTwo years later, on 9 February 1526, a group of sixteen Spanish deserters burnt the palace of the \"Ahpo Xahil\", sacked the temples and kidnapped a priest, acts that the Kaqchikel blamed on Pedro de Alvarado. The Kaqchikel kept up resistance against the Spanish for a number of years. On 9 May 1530, exhausted by the warfare that had seen the deaths of their best warriors and the enforced abandonment of their crops, the two kings of the most important clans returned from the wilds. A day later they were joined by many nobles and their families and many more people; they then surrendered at the new Spanish capital at Ciudad Vieja.\nPacific lowlands of Guatemala.\nOn 8 May 1524, Pedro de Alvarado continued southwards to the Pacific coastal plain with an army numbering approximately 6000, where he defeated the Pipil of Panacal or Panacaltepeque near Izcuintepeque on 9 May. Alvarado described the terrain approaching the town as very difficult, covered with dense vegetation and swampland that made the use of cavalry impossible; instead he sent men with crossbows ahead. The Pipil withdrew their scouts because of the heavy rain, believing that the Spanish and their allies would not be able to reach the town that day.\nPedro de Alvarado pressed ahead and when the Spanish entered the town the defenders were completely unprepared, with the Pipil warriors indoors sheltering from the torrential rain. In the battle that ensued, the Spanish and their indigenous allies suffered minor losses but the Pipil were able to flee into the forest, sheltered from Spanish pursuit by the weather and the vegetation. Pedro de Alvarado ordered the town to be burnt and sent messengers to the Pipil lords demanding their surrender, otherwise he would lay waste to their lands.\nAccording to Alvarado's letter to Cort\u00e9s, the Pipil came back to the town and submitted to him, accepting the king of Spain as their overlord. The Spanish force camped in the captured town for eight days. A few years later, in 1529, Pedro de Alvarado was accused of using excessive brutality in his conquest of Izcuintepeque, amongst other atrocities.\nIn Guazacap\u00e1n, Pedro de Alvarado described his encounter with people who were neither Maya nor Pipil, speaking a different language altogether; these people were probably Xinca. At this point Alvarado's force consisted of 250 Spanish infantry accompanied by 6,000 indigenous allies, mostly Kaqchikel and Cholutec. Alvarado and his army defeated and occupied the most important Xinca city, named as Atiquipaque. The defending warriors were described by Alvarado as engaging in fierce hand-to-hand combat using spears, stakes and poisoned arrows. The battle took place on 26 May 1524 and resulted in a significant reduction of the Xinca population.\nAlvarado's army continued eastwards from Atiquipaque, seizing several more Xinca cities. Because Alvarado and his allies could not understand the Xinca language, Alvarado took extra precautions on the march eastward by strengthening his vanguard and rearguard with ten cavalry apiece. In spite of these precautions the baggage train was ambushed by a Xinca army soon after leaving Taxisco. Many indigenous allies were killed and most of the baggage was lost, including all the crossbows and ironwork for the horses.\nThis was a serious setback and Alvarado camped his army in Nancintla for eight days, during which time he sent two expeditions against the attacking army. Alvarado sent out Xinca messengers to make contact with the enemy but they failed to return. Messengers from the city of Pazaco, in the modern department of Jutiapa, offered peace to the conquistadors but when Alvarado arrived there the next day the inhabitants were preparing for war. Alvarado's troops encountered a sizeable quantity of gathered warriors and quickly routed them through the city's streets. From Pazaco, Alvarado crossed the R\u00edo Paz and entered what is now El Salvador.\nCuzcatlan (El Salvador).\nAlvarado led the first effort by Spanish forces to extend their dominion to the nation of Cuzcatlan (in modern El Salvador), in June 1524. These efforts established many towns such as San Jos\u00e9 Acatempa in 1525 and Esquipulas in 1560. Spanish efforts were firmly resisted by the indigenous people known as the Pipil and their Mayan speaking neighbors. Despite Alvarado's initial success in the Battle of Acajutla, the indigenous people of Cuzcatl\u00e1n, who according to tradition were led by a warlord called Atl\u00e1catl, defeated the Spaniards and their auxiliaries, and forced them to withdraw to Guatemala.\nAlvarado was wounded on his left thigh, remaining handicapped for the rest of his life. He abandoned the war and appointed his brother, Gonzalo de Alvarado, to continue the task. Two subsequent expeditions were required (the first in 1525, followed by a smaller group in 1528) to bring the Pipil under Spanish control. In 1528 the conquest of Cuzcatl\u00e1n was completed and the city of San Salvador was established.\nTitles and first marriage.\nOn 18 December 1527, the king of Spain named Alvarado as governor of Guatemala; two days later he granted him the coveted military title of \"Adelantado\". Alvarado's close friendship with Cort\u00e9s was broken in the same year; Alvarado had promised Cort\u00e9s that he would marry Cecilia V\u00e1zquez, Cortes' cousin. Alvarado broke his promise and instead married Francisca de la Cueva. Technically, this was not his first marriage as he married an indigenous woman, daughter to Xicotencatl the Elder, who was referred to as Dona Luisa by Spanish speakers and Tlecuiluatzin by Nahuatl speakers.\nFrancisca de la Cueva was well connected at the royal court, being the niece of Francisco de los Cobos, the king's secretary, and a member of the powerful noble house of Albuquerque. This marriage gave Alvarado extra leverage at court and was far more useful to his long term interests; Alvarado thereafter maintained a friendship with Francisco de los Cobos that allowed him access to the king's favour. In 1528, by coincidence both Alvarado and Cort\u00e9s were in Seville at the same time, but Cort\u00e9s ignored him.\nFrancisca de la Cueva died shortly after their arrival in America. Alvarado remained governor of Guatemala until his death. He was made Knight of Santiago in 1527.\nPeru.\nBy 1532, Alvarado's friendship with Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s had soured, and he no longer trusted him. At this time Alvarado requested permission from the king for an expedition south along the Pacific coast, to conquer any lands there that had not already been claimed for the Crown, and specifically rejected that Cort\u00e9s should accompany him. In 1534, Alvarado heard tales of the riches of Peru, headed south to the Andes and attempted to bring the province of Quito under his rule. When he arrived, he found the land already held by Francisco Pizarro's lieutenant Sebasti\u00e1n de Belalc\u00e1zar. The two forces of Conquistadors almost came to battle; however, Alvarado bartered to Pizarro's group most of his ships, horses, and ammunition, plus most of his men, for a comparatively modest sum of money, and returned to Guatemala.\nGovernor of Honduras.\nIn 1532, Alvarado received a Royal Cedula naming him Governor of the Province of Honduras. At that time, Honduras consisted of a single settlement of Spaniards in Trujillo, but he declined to act on it. In 1533 or 1534 he began to send his own work gangs of enslaved Africans and Native Americans into the parts of Honduras adjacent to Guatemala to work the placer gold deposits.\nIn 1536, ostensibly in response to a letter asking for aid from Andr\u00e9s de Cereceda, then acting Governor of the Province of Honduras, Alvarado and his army of Indian allies arrived in Honduras, just as the Spanish colonists were preparing to abandon the country and go look for gold in Peru. In June, 1536, Alvarado engaged the indigenous resistance led by Cicumba in the lower Ulua river valley, and won. He divided up the Indian labor in \"repartimiento\" grants to his soldiers and some of the colonists, and returned to Guatemala.\nDuring a visit to Spain, in 1537, Alvarado had the governorship of Honduras reconfirmed in addition to that of Guatemala for the next seven years. His governorship of Honduras was not uncontested. Francisco de Montejo had a rival claim, and was installed by the Spanish king as Governor of Honduras in 1540. Ten years after being widowed, Alvarado married one of his first wife's sisters, Beatriz de la Cueva, who outlived him.\nAfter the death of Alvarado, de la Cueva maneuvered her own election and succeeded him as governor of Guatemala, becoming the only woman to govern a major political division of the Americas in Spanish colonial times. She drowned a few days after taking office in the destruction of the capital city Ciudad Vieja by a sudden mudflow from the Volc\u00e1n de Agua in 1541.\nDeath in the Mixt\u00f3n War, 1541.\nAlvarado developed a plan to outfit an armada that would sail from the western coast of Mexico to China and the Spice Islands. At great cost, he assembled and equipped 13 ships and approximately 550 soldiers for the expedition. The fleet was about to set sail in 1541 when Alvarado received a letter from Crist\u00f3bal de O\u00f1ate, pleading for help against hostile Indians who were besieging him at Nochistl\u00e1n.\nThe siege was part of a major revolt by the Mixt\u00f3n natives of the Nueva Galicia region of Mexico. Alvarado gathered his troops and went to help O\u00f1ate. In a freak accident, he was crushed by a horse that was spooked and ran amok. Alvarado lay in agony before eventually dying a few days later, on July 4, 1541, and was buried in the church at Tiripet\u00edo, a village between P\u00e1tzcuaro and Morelia (in present-day Michoac\u00e1n).\nFour decades after Alvarado's death, his mestiza daughter Leonor de Alvarado Xicot\u00e9ncatl paid to transport his remains to Guatemala for reburial in the cathedral of the city of Santiago de los Caballeros de Guatemala, now Antigua Guatemala.\nFamily.\nAfter the death of her husband, Beatriz de la Cueva maneuvered her own election and succeeded him as governor of Guatemala, becoming the only woman to govern a major political division of the Americas in Spanish colonial times.\nAlvarado had no children from either of his legal marriages. His life companion was his concubine Luisa de Tlaxcala (also called Xicot\u00e9ncatl or Tecubalsi, her original names after Catholic baptism). She was a Nahua noblewoman, daughter of the Tlaxcallan King Xicotencatl the Elder. Luisa was given by her father in 1519 to Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s as a proof of respect and friendship. In turn Cort\u00e9s gave her \"in guard\" to Pedro de Alvarado, who quickly and unremarkably became her lover. Luisa followed Alvarado in his pursuit of conquests beyond central Mexico. Despite never being his legitimate wife, Luisa de Tlaxcala had numerous possessions and was respected as a Do\u00f1a, both for her relationship with Alvarado and for her noble origin. She died in 1535 and was buried at the Guatemala Cathedral.\nWith Luisa de Tlaxcala Pedro de Alvarado had three children: \n Leonor married a second time, to Francisco de la Cueva y Guzman. The Alvarado fortune remained with their descendants for generations to come, in the family of Villacreces de la Cueva y Guzm\u00e1n, governors of this part of Guatemala.\nBy other women, in more casual relationships, he had two other children: \nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The most common use is to treat refractive errors: myopia, hypermetropia, astigmatism, and presbyopia. Glasses or \"spectacles\" are worn on the face a short distance in front of the eye. Contact lenses are worn directly on the surface of the eye. Intraocular lenses are surgically implanted most commonly after cataract removal but can be used for purely refractive purposes. \nPrescription of corrective lenses.\nCorrective lenses are typically prescribed by an ophthalmologist or an optometrist. The prescription consists of all the specifications necessary to make the lens. Prescriptions typically include the power specifications of each lens (for each eye). Strengths are generally prescribed in quarter-diopter steps (0.25 D), because most people cannot generally distinguish between smaller increments (e.g., eighth-diopter steps / 0.125 D). The use of improper corrective lenses may not be helpful and can even exacerbate binocular vision disorders. Eyecare professionals (optometrists and ophthalmologists) are trained to determine the specific corrective lenses that will provide the clearest, most comfortable, and most efficient vision, avoiding double vision and maximizing binocularity.\nOver-the-counter correction.\nReady-made single-vision reading glasses go by many names, including over-the-counter glasses, ready readers, cheaters, magnifiers, non-prescription readers, or generic readers. They are designed to lessen the focusing burden of near work, such as reading. They are typically sold in retail locations such as pharmacies and grocery stores but are also available in book stores and clothing retailers. They are available in common reading prescriptions with strengths ranging from +0.75 to +3.50 diopters. While these \"magnifiers\" do indeed make the image of the viewed object bigger, their main advantage comes from focusing the image, not magnification.\nThese glasses are not tailored to a person's individual needs. A difference in refractive error between the eyes or the presence of astigmatism will not be accounted for. People with little to no need for correction in the distance may find off-the-shelf glasses work quite well for seeing better during near vision tasks. But if the person has a significant need for distance correction, it is less likely that the over-the-counter glasses will be perfectly effective. Although such glasses are generally considered safe, an individual prescription, as determined by an ophthalmologist or optometrist and made by a qualified optician, usually results in better visual correction and fewer headaches and visual discomfort. Another criticism of over-the-counter glasses is that they may alleviate symptoms, causing a person to forgo the other benefits of routine vision exams, such as early diagnosis of chronic disease.\nSelf-selected corrective lenses.\nAlthough lenses are normally prescribed by optometrists or ophthalmologists, there is evidence from developing countries that allowing people to select lenses for themselves produces good results in the majority of cases and is less than a tenth of the cost of prescription lenses.\nLens types.\nSingle vision.\nSingle vision lenses correct for only one distance. If they correct for far distance, the person must accommodate to see up close. If the person cannot accommodate, they may need a separate correction for near distances, or else use a multifocal lens (see below).\nReading glasses are single vision lenses designed for near work and include over the counter glasses. They come in two main styles: full frames, in which the entire lens is made in the reading prescription, and half-eyes, style glasses that sit lower down on the nose. Full frame readers must be removed to see distance clearly, while the distance can be clearly viewed over the top of half-eye readers.\nBifocal.\nA bifocal is a lens with two sections, separated by a line (see image to the right). Generally, the upper part of the lens is used for distance vision, while the lower segment is used for near vision. The area of the lens that caters to near vision is called the add segment. There are many different shapes, sizes, and positions for the add segment, such as rounded bifocals and D segment bifocals, that are selected for functional differences as well as the visual demands of the patient. Bifocals allow people with presbyopia to see clearly at distance and near without having to remove the glasses, which would be required with single vision correction.\nTrifocal.\nTrifocal lenses are similar to bifocals, except that the two focal areas are separated by a third area (with intermediate focus correction) in the middle. This segment corrects the wearer's vision for intermediate distances roughly at arms' length, \"e.g.\" computer distance. This lens type has two segment lines, dividing the three different correcting segments.\nProgressive.\nProgressive addition or varifocal lenses provide a smooth transition from distance correction to near correction, eliminating segment lines and allowing clear vision at all distances, including intermediate (roughly arms' length). The lack of any abrupt change in power and the uniform appearance of the lens gives rise to the name \"no-line bifocal\".\nMultifocal.\nMultifocal contact lenses (e.g. bifocals or progressives) are comparable to spectacles with bifocals or progressive lenses because they have multiple focal points. Multifocal contact lenses are typically designed for constant viewing through the center of the lens, but some designs do incorporate a shift in lens position to view through the reading power (similar to bifocal glasses).\nAdjustable focus.\nThe power or focal length of adjustable or variable focus can be changed to suit the needs of the wearer. A typical application of such a lens is to refocus the correction allowing clear vision at any distance. Unlike with bifocals, near-vision correction is achieved over the entire field of view, in any direction. Switching between distance and near vision is accomplished by re-adjusting the lens, instead of by tilting and/or rotating the head. The need for constant adjustment when the person's attention switches to an object at a different distance is a design challenge of such a lens. Manual adjustment is more cumbersome than bifocals or similar lenses. Automated systems require electronic systems, power supplies, and sensors that increase the cost, size, and weight of the correction.\nPlano.\nA corrective lens with a power of zero is called a plano lens. These lenses are used when one or both eyes do not require correction of a refractive error. Some people with good natural eyesight like to wear eyeglasses as a style accessory, or want to change the appearance of their eyes using novelty contact lenses.\nLens optical profile.\nAlthough corrective lenses can be produced in many different profiles, the most common is ophthalmic or convex-concave. In an ophthalmic lens, both the front and back surfaces have a positive radius, resulting in a positive/convergent front surface and a negative/divergent back surface. The difference in curvature between the front and rear surface leads to the corrective power of the lens. In hyperopia a convergent lens is needed; therefore, the convergent front surface overpowers the divergent back surface. For myopia the opposite is true: the divergent back surface is greater in magnitude than the convergent front surface. To correct for presbyopia, the lens, or section of the lens, must be more convergent or less divergent than the person's distance lens.\nThe base curve (usually determined from the profile of the front surface of an ophthalmic lens) can be changed to result in the best optic and cosmetic characteristics across the entire surface of the lens. Optometrists may choose to specify a particular base curve when prescribing a corrective lens for either of these reasons. A multitude of mathematical formulas and professional clinical experience has allowed optometrists and lens designers to determine standard base curves that are ideal for most people. As a result, the front surface curve is more standardized and the characteristics that generate a person's unique prescription are typically derived from the geometry of the back surface of the lens.\nBifocals and trifocals.\nBifocals and trifocals result in a more complex lens profile, compounding multiple surfaces. The main lens is composed of a typical ophthalmic lens. Thus the base curve defines the front surface of the main part of the lens while the back surface geometry is changed to achieve the desired distance power. The \"bifocal\" is a third spherical segment, called an \"add segment\", found on the front surface of the lens. Steeper and more convergent than the base curve, the add segment combines with the back surface to deliver the person's near correction. Early manufacturing techniques fused a separate lens to the front surface, but modern processes cut all the geometry into a single piece of lens material. There are many locations, profiles, and sizes of add segments typically referred to as segment type. Some \"seg type\" examples include Flat top, Kryptok, Orthogon, Tillyer Executive, and Ultex A. Trifocals contain two add segments to achieve a lens that corrects the person's vision for three distinct distances.\nThe optical center of the add segment may be placed on the lens surface or may hang off into an empty space near the lens surface. Although the surface profile of a bifocal segment is spherical, it is often trimmed to have straight edges so that it is contained within a small region of the overall lens surface.\nProgressive lens.\nThe progressive addition lens (PAL, also commonly called a no-line or varifocal lens) eliminates the line in bi/tri-focals and is very complex in its profile. PALs are a continuously variable parametric surface that begins using one spherical surface base curve and ends at another, with the radius of curvature continuously varying as the transition is made from one surface to the other. This shift in curvature results in different powers being delivered from different locations on the lens.\nVertex distance.\nVertex distance is the space between the front of the eye and the back surface of the lens. In glasses with powers beyond \u00b14.00D, the vertex distance can affect the effective power of the glasses. A shorter vertex distance can expand the field of view, but if the vertex distance is too small, the eyelashes will come into contact with the back of the lens, smudging the lens and causing annoyance for the wearer. A skilled frame stylist will help the wearer select a good balance of fashionable frame size with good vertex distance to achieve ideal aesthetics and field of view. The average vertex distance in a pair of glasses is 12-14mm. A contact lens is placed directly on the eye and thus has a vertex distance of zero.\nRefractive index.\nIn the UK and the US, the refractive index is generally specified concerning the yellow He-d Fraunhofer line, commonly abbreviated as nd. Lens materials are classified by their refractive index, as follows:\nThis is a general classification. Often for marketing purposes, materials with nd values that are at or above 1.60 can be referred to as \"high-index\". Likewise, Trivex and other borderline normal / mid-index materials may be referred to as mid-index.\nOptical quality.\nAbbe number.\nOf all of the properties of particular lens material, the one that most closely relates to its optical performance is its dispersion, which is specified by the Abbe number. Higher Abbe numbers mean a better lens material, and lower Abbe numbers result in the presence of chromatic aberration (i.e., color fringes above/below or to the left/right of a high contrast object), especially in larger lens sizes and stronger prescriptions (beyond \u00b14.00D). Generally, lower Abbe numbers are a property of mid and higher index lenses that cannot be avoided, regardless of the material used. The Abbe number for a material at a particular refractive index formulation is usually specified as its Abbe value.\nIn practice, an Abbe number change from 30 to 32 will not have a practically noticeable benefit, but a change from 30 to 47 could be beneficial for users with strong prescriptions that move their eyes and look \"off-axis\" of the optical center of the lens. Some users do not sense color fringing directly but will just describe \"off-axis blurriness\".\nAbbe values even as high as that of produce chromatic aberrations which can be perceptible to a user in lenses larger than 40\u00a0mm in diameter and especially in strengths that are in excess of \u00b14\u00a0D. At \u00b18\u00a0D even glass produces chromatic aberration that can be noticed by a user. Chromatic aberration is independent of the lens being of spherical, aspheric, or atoric design.\nThe eye's Abbe number is independent of the importance of the corrective lens's Abbe, since the human eye:\nIn contrast, the eye moves to look through various parts of a corrective lens as it shifts its gaze, some of which can be as much as several centimeters off of the optical center. Thus, despite the eye's dispersive properties, the corrective lens's dispersion cannot be dismissed. People who are sensitive to the effects of chromatic aberrations, or who have stronger prescriptions, or who often look off the lens's optical center, or who prefer larger corrective lens sizes may be impacted by chromatic aberration. To minimize chromatic aberration:\nPower error.\nPower error is the change in the optical power of a lens as the eye looks through various points on the area of the lens. Generally, it is least present at the optic center and gets progressively worse as one looks towards the edges of the lens. The actual amount of power error is highly dependent on the strength of the prescription as well as whether a best spherical form of lens or an optically optimal aspherical form was used in the manufacture of the lens. Generally, the best spherical form lenses attempt to keep the ocular curve between four and seven diopters.\nLens induced oblique astigmatism.\nAs the eye shifts its gaze from looking through the optical center of the corrective lens, the lens-induced astigmatism value increases. In a spherical lens, especially one with a strong correction whose base curve is not in the best spherical form, such increases can significantly impact the clarity of vision in the periphery.\nMinimizing power error and lens induced astigmatism.\nAs corrective power increases, even optimally designed lenses will have distortion that can be noticed by a user. This particularly affects individuals that use the off-axis areas of their lenses for visually demanding tasks. For individuals sensitive to lens errors, the best way to eliminate lens induced aberrations is to use contact lenses. Contacts eliminate all these aberrations since the lens then moves with the eye.\nBarring contacts, a good lens designer does not have many parameters that can be traded off to improve vision. The index has little effect on error. Note that, although chromatic aberration is often perceived as \"blurry vision\" in the lens periphery and gives the impression of power error, this is actually due to color shifting. Chromatic aberration can be improved by using a material with improved ABBE. The best way to combat lens induced power error is to limit the choice of corrective lens to one that is in the best spherical form. A lens designer determines the best-form spherical curve using the Oswalt curve on the Tscherning ellipse. This design gives the best achievable optical quality and least sensitivity to lens fitting. A flatter base-curve is sometimes selected for cosmetic reasons. Aspheric or atoric design can reduce errors induced by using a suboptimal flatter base-curve. They cannot surpass the optical quality of a spherical best-form lens but can reduce the error induced by using a flatter-than-optimal base curve. The improvement due to flattening is most evident for strong farsighted lenses. High myopes (-6D) may see a slight cosmetic benefit with larger lenses. Mild prescriptions will have no perceptible benefit (-2D). Even at high prescriptions, some high myope prescriptions with small lenses may not see any difference, since some aspheric lenses have a spherically designed center area for improved vision and fit.\nIn practice, labs tend to produce pre-finished and finished lenses in groups of narrow power ranges to reduce inventory. Lens powers that fall into the range of the prescriptions of each group share a constant base curve. For example, corrections from -4.00D to -4.50D may be grouped and forced to share the same base curve characteristics, but the spherical form is only best for a -4.25D prescription. In this case, the error will be imperceptible to the human eye. However, some manufacturers may further cost-reduce inventory and group over a larger range which will result in perceptible error for some users in the range who also use the off-axis area of their lens. Additionally, some manufacturers may verge toward a slightly flatter curve. Although if only a slight bias toward plano is introduced it may be negligible cosmetically and optically. These optical degradations due to base-curve grouping also apply to aspherics since their shapes are intentionally flattened and then asphericized to minimize error for the average base curve in the grouping.\nCosmetics and weight.\nReducing lens thickness.\nThe greatest cosmetic improvement on lens thickness (and weight) benefits from choosing a frame that holds physically small lenses. The smallest of the popular adult lens sizes available in retail outlets is about across. There are a few adult sizes of , and although they are quite rare, can reduce lens weight to about half of the 50\u00a0mm versions. The curves on the front and back of a lens are ideally formed with the specific radius of a sphere. This radius is set by the lens designer based on the prescription and cosmetic consideration. Selecting a smaller lens will mean less of this sphere surface is represented by the lens surface, meaning the lens will have a thinner edge (myopia) or center (hyperopia). A thinner edge reduces light entering into the edge, reducing an additional source of internal reflections.\nExtremely thick lenses for myopia can be beveled to reduce flaring out of the very thick edge. Thick myopic lenses are not usually mounted in wire frames, because the thin wire contrasts against the thick lens, to make its thickness much more obvious to others.\nThe index can improve the lens thinness, but at a point, no more improvement will be realized. For example, if an index and lens size is selected with center to edge thickness difference of 1\u00a0mm then changing index can only improve thickness by a fraction of this. This is also true with aspheric design lenses.\nThe lens's minimum thickness can also be varied. The FDA ball drop test (5/8\" 0.56-ounce steel ball dropped from 50 inches) effectively sets the minimum thickness of materials. Glass or CR-39 requires 2.0\u00a0mm, but some newer materials only require 1.5\u00a0mm or even 1.0\u00a0mm minimum thickness.\nWeight.\nMaterial density typically increases as lens thickness is reduced by increasing index. There is also a minimum lens thickness required to support the lens shape. These factors result in a thinner lens which is not lighter than the original. There are lens materials with lower density at higher index which can result in a truly lighter lens. These materials can be found in a material property table. Reducing frame lens size will give the most noticeable improvement in weight for a given material. Ways to reduce the weight and thickness of corrective lenses, in approximate order of importance are these:\nIt is not always possible to follow the above points, because of the rarity of such frames, and the need for a more pleasing appearance. However, these are the main factors to consider if ever it should become necessary and possible to do so.\nFacial distortion and social stigma.\nEyeglasses for a high-diopter nearsighted or farsighted person cause a visible distortion of their face as seen by other people, in the apparent size of the eyes and facial features visible through the eyeglasses.\nEither situation can result in social stigma due to some facial distortions. This can result in the low self-esteem of the eyeglass wearer and lead to difficulty in making friends and developing relationships.\nPeople with very high-power corrective lenses can benefit socially from contact lenses because these distortions are minimized and their facial appearance to others is normal. Aspheric/atoric eyeglass design can also reduce minification and magnification of the eye for observers at some angles.\nLens materials.\nOptical crown glass.\nGlass lenses have become less common owing to the danger of shattering and their relatively high weight compared to CR-39 plastic lenses. They still remain in use for specialised circumstances, for example in extremely high prescriptions (currently, glass lenses can be manufactured up to a refractive index of 1.9) and in certain occupations where the hard surface of glass offers more protection from sparks or shards of material. If the highest Abbe number is desired, the only choices for common lens optical material are optical crown glass and CR-39.\nHigher-quality optical-grade glass materials exist (e.g. Borosilicate crown glasses such as http:// which is commonly used in telescopes and binoculars, and fluorite crown glasses such as the best optical quality low dispersion glass currently in production, https:// made by the German company Schott with the following characteristics and are commonly used in high-end camera lenses).\nOne must bear in mind that the human eye itself has an https:// so the expensive, high-end optical glass types mentioned above have little value for central vision; however, the wearer's view through the side of a glass lens is not comparable to central vision through the eye: Low dispersion glass definitely makes optically superior corrective lenses since it greatly reduces color-fringing of edge-wise viewed contrasty objects, compared to all available plastics. But glass lenses are much heavier, and making them requires specialized glass grinding equipment no longer common in ordinary prescription lens labs: At present, one is often hard-pressed to find an optical laboratory that has the machinery needed shape custom glass lenses.\nA further complication for seeking lenses made of better, even-lower dispersion glass, is that the specialty glass is often expensive. Also, many exotic glass types, with Abbe number contain oxides of heavy metals such as arsenic or lanthanum, some of which are toxic. The need for special venting to protect technicians from exposure to powdered toxic glass further limits the number of optical labs that can safely grind super-low dispersion / large Abbe number glass.\nAbbe numbers (Vd) in excess of Crown Glass and CR-39 are mainly warranted only for unusual special uses, such as\nOptical plastics.\nPlastic lenses are currently the most commonly prescribed lens, owing to their relative safety, low cost, ease of production, and high optical quality. The main drawbacks of many types of plastic lenses are the ease by which a lens can be scratched, and the limitations and costs of producing higher-index lenses.\nCR-39.\nCR-39 lenses are inherently scratch resistant.\nTrivex.\nTrivex was invented by Edwin C. Slagel and patented in September 1998.\nTrivex was developed in 2001 by PPG Industries for the military as transparent armor. With Hoya Corporation and Younger Optics, PPG announced the availability of Trivex for the optical industry in 2001. Trivex is a urethane-based pre-polymer. PPG named the material Trivex because of its three main performance properties: Superior optics, ultra lightweight, and extreme strength.\nTrivex is a relative newcomer that possesses the UV-blocking properties and shatter resistance of polycarbonate while at the same time offering far superior optical quality (i.e., higher Abbe number) and a slightly lower density. Its lower refractive index of vs. polycarbonate's 1.586 may result in slightly thicker lenses depending upon the prescription. Along with polycarbonate and the various high-index plastics, Trivex is a lab favorite for use in rimless frames, owing to the ease with which it can be drilled and its resistance to cracking around the drill holes. One other advantage that Trivex has over polycarbonate is that it can be tinted.\nPolycarbonate.\nPolycarbonate is lighter weight than normal plastic. It blocks UV rays, is shatter resistant, and is used in sports glasses and glasses for children and teenagers. Because polycarbonate is soft and will scratch easily, a scratch-resistant coating is typically applied after shaping and polishing the lens. Standard polycarbonate with an Abbe number of 30 is one of the worst materials optically if chromatic aberration intolerance is of concern. Along with Trivex and the high-index plastics, polycarbonate is an excellent choice for rimless eyeglasses. Similar to the high-index plastics, polycarbonate has a very low Abbe number, which may be bothersome to individuals sensitive to chromatic aberrations.\nHigh-index plastics (thiourethanes).\nHigh-index plastics allow for thinner lenses. The lenses may not be lighter, however, due to the increase in density vs. mid- and normal index materials. A disadvantage is that high-index plastic lenses have a much higher level of chromatic aberrations, which can be seen from their lower Abbe numbers. Aside from the thinness of the lens, another advantage of high-index plastics is their strength and shatter resistance, although not as shatter resistant as polycarbonate. This makes them particularly suitable for rimless eyeglasses.\nThese high-refractive-index plastics are typically thiourethanes, with the sulfur atoms in the polymer being responsible for the high refractive index. The sulfur content can be up to 60 percent by weight for a material with index \nOphthalmic material property tables.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nIndices of refraction for a range of materials can be found in the list of refractive indices.\nLens coatings.\nAnti-reflective.\nAnti-reflective coatings help to make the eye behind the lens more visible. They also help lessen back reflections of the white of the eye as well as bright objects behind the eyeglasses wearer (e.g. windows, lamps). Such a reduction of back reflections increases the apparent contrast of surroundings. At night, anti-reflective coatings help to reduce headlight glare from oncoming cars, street lamps, and heavily lit or neon signs.\nOne problem with anti-reflective coatings is that historically they have been very easy to scratch. Newer coatings try to address this problem by combining scratch resistance with the anti-reflective coating. They also offer a measure of dirt and smudge resistance, due to their hydrophobic qualities. \nUltraviolet protection.\nA UV coating is used to reduce the transmission of light in the ultraviolet spectrum. UV-B radiation increases the likelihood of cataracts, while long-term exposure to UV-A radiation can damage the retina. DNA damage from UV light is cumulative and irreversible. Some materials such as Trivex and Polycarbonate, naturally block most UV light; they have UV-cutoff wavelengths just outside the visible range and do not benefit from the application of a UV coating. Many modern anti-reflective coatings also block UV.\nScratch resistance.\nResists damage to lens surfaces from minor scratches.\nConfusing corrective lens industry terminology.\nSpheric vs. aspheric, atoric, etc..\nLens manufacturers claim that aspheric lenses improve vision over traditional spheric lenses. This statement could be misleading to individuals who do not know that the lenses are being implicitly compared to \"a spheric flattened away from best-form for cosmetic reasons\". This qualification is necessary since best-form spherics are always better than aspherics for an ophthalmic lens application. Aspherics are only used for corrective lenses when, in order to achieve a flatter lens for cosmetic reasons, the lens design deviates from the best-form sphere; this results in degradation of the visual correction, degradation which can, in some part, be compensated for by an aspheric design. The same is true for atoric and bi-aspheric.\nWhile it is true that aspheric lenses are used in cameras and binoculars, it would be wrong to assume that this means aspherics/atorics result in better optics for eyewear. Cameras and telescopes use multiple lens elements and have different design criteria. Spectacles are made of only one ophthalmic lens, and the best-form spheric lens has been shown to give the best vision. In cases where best-form is not used, such as cosmetic flattening, thinning or wrap-around sunglasses, an aspheric design can reduce the amount of induced optical distortions.\nIt is worth noting that aspheric lenses are a broad category. A lens is made of two curved surfaces, and an aspheric lens is a lens where one or both of those surfaces is not spherical. Further research and development is being conducted to determine whether the mathematical and theoretical benefits of aspheric lenses can be implemented in practice in a way that results in better vision correction.\nOptical aberrations of the eye lens vs. corrective lens.\nOptical terms are used to describe errors in the eye's lens and the corrective lens. This can cause confusion since \"astigmatism\" or \"ABBE\" has a drastically different impact on vision depending on which lens has the error.\nAstigmatism disambiguation.\nAstigmatism of the eye: Patients who are prescribed a sphere and a cylinder prescription have astigmatism of the eye, and can be given a toric lens to correct it.\nAstigmatism of the corrective lens: This phenomenon is called lens-induced oblique astigmatism error (OAE) or power error and is induced when the eye looks through the ophthalmic lens at a point oblique to the optical center (OC). This may become especially evident beyond -6D.\nExample: A patient with astigmatism (or no astigmatism) of the eye and a high prescription may notice astigmatism of the lens (OAE) when looking through the corner of their glasses.\nAspheric and atoric disambiguation.\nIn ophthalmic terminology, \"aspheric lens\" specifically refers to a subclass of aspheric lens. Designs that feature \"flatter\" curves trade optical quality for cosmetic appearance. By using a non-spheric lens shape, an aspheric lens attempts to correct the error induced by flattening the lens. Typically, the design focuses on reducing the error (OAE) across the horizontal and vertical lens axis edges. This is of primary benefit to farsighted individuals, whose lenses have a thick center.\nAn atoric lens design refers to a lens with a more complex aspheric lens design. An atoric lens design can address errors over more corners of the lens, not just the horizontal and vertical axis.\nA toric lens is designed to compensate for the astigmatism of a patient's eye. Even though this lens is technically \"aspheric\", the terms \"aspheric\" and \"atoric\" are reserved for lenses which correct errors induced by cosmetic lens flattening.\nU.S. legal requirements for prescriptions.\nIn the United States, laws at the federal and state level govern the provision and effective dates of prescriptions for contact lenses and eyeglasses. Federal law requires that eyeglass and contact lens prescriptions be given to every consumer and that the prescriptions be for a minimum of one year. (FTC Section 456.2 \"Separation of examination and dispensing\" was reviewed in 2004: http://).\nState laws vary. For example, California law also requires prescriptions to be provided to clients whether demanded or not. Eyeglass prescriptions must be for a minimum of two years, and contact prescriptions must be for a minimum of one year.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is the main town of the Torridge local government district.\nToponymy.\nIn ancient records Bideford is recorded as \"Bedeford\", \"Byddyfrod\", \"Bedyford\", \"Bydeford\", \"Bytheford\" and \"Biddeford\". The etymology of the name means \"by the ford,\" and records show that, before there was a bridge, there was a ford at Bideford where River Torridge is estuarine; and at low tide, it is possible (but not advisable) to cross the river by wading on foot.\nHistory.\nEarly history.\nHubba the Dane was said to have attacked Devon in the area around Bideford near Northam or near Kenwith Castle, and was repelled either by Alfred the Great (849\u2013899) or by the Saxon Earl of Devon.\nThe manor of Bideford was recorded in the Domesday Book of 1086 as held at some time in chief from William the Conqueror by the great Saxon nobleman Brictric, but later held by the king's wife Matilda of Flanders (c. 1031\u20131083). There were then 30 villagers, 8 smallholders and 14 slaves in Bideford, within the ancient hundred of Merton in Devon. According to the account by the \"Continuator of Wace\" and others, in his youth Brictric declined the romantic advances of Matilda and his great fiefdom was thereupon seized by her. Whatever the truth of the matter, years later, when she was acting as regent in England for William the Conqueror, she used her authority to confiscate Brictric's lands and threw him into prison, where he died. The Exon Domesday notes that Bideford and nearby Littleham were held at fee farm from the king by Gotshelm, a Devonshire tenant-in-chief of 28 manors and brother of Walter de Claville. Gotshelm's 28 manors descended to the Honour of Gloucester, as did most of Brictric's.\nAfter the death of Matilda in 1083, Brictric's lands were granted by her eldest son King William Rufus (1087\u20131100) to Robert FitzHamon (died 1107), the conqueror of Glamorgan, whose daughter and sole heiress Maud (or Mabel) FitzHamon brought them to her husband Robert de Caen, 1st Earl of Gloucester (pre-1100 \u2013 1147), an illegitimate son of Matilda's younger son King Henry I (reigned 1100\u20131135). Thus Brictric's fiefdom became the feudal barony of Gloucester. The Grenville family held Bideford for many centuries under the overlordship of the feudal barons of Gloucester, which barony was soon absorbed into the Crown, when they became tenants in chief.\nSir Richard I de Grenville (d. after 1142) (\"alias\" de Grainvilla, de Greinvill, etc.) was one of the Twelve Knights of Glamorgan who served in the Norman Conquest of Glamorgan under his elder brother Robert FitzHamon (died 1107), the first Norman feudal baron of Gloucester and Lord of Glamorgan from 1075. He obtained from FitzHamon the lordship of Neath, Glamorgan, where he built Neath Castle and in 1129 founded Neath Abbey. Richard de Grenville was one of three (or four) known sons of Hamo Dapifer (died around 1100) Sheriff of Kent, an Anglo-Norman royal official under both King William the Conqueror (1066\u20131087) and his son King William Rufus (1087\u20131100). He is by tradition the founder and ancestor of the prominent Westcountry Grenville family of Stowe in the parish of Kilkhampton in Cornwall and of Bideford in Devon.\nBy tradition Richard de Grenville is said by Prince (died 1723), (apparently following \"Fuller's Worthies\") to have founded Neath Abbey and bestowed upon it all his military acquisitions for its maintenance, and to have\n\"returned to his patrimony at Bideford where he lived in great honour and reputation the rest of his days\".\nHowever, according to Round (died 1928) \"no proof exists that Richard I de Grenville ever held the manor of Bideford, which was later one of the principal seats of the West Country Grenville family. It was however certainly one of the constituent manors of the Honour of Gloucester granted by King William Rufus to Robert FitzHamon.\" Richard de Grenville is known to have held seven knight's fees from the Honour of Gloucester, granted to him either by his brother FitzHamon or by the latter's son-in-law and heir Robert, 1st Earl of Gloucester (1100\u20131147). Round supposes instead that the Grenvilles of Bideford and Stowe were descended from a certain \"Robert de Grenville\" (\"alias\" de Grainville, de Grainavilla, etc.) who was a junior witness to Richard's foundation charter of Neath Abbey, and who in the 1166 Cartae Baronum return was listed as holding one knight's fee from the Earl of Gloucester, feudal baron of Gloucester. Robert's familial relationship, if any, to Richard is unknown.\nA charter was granted in 1272 to Richard V de Grenville by King Henry III, which created the town's first council. In ancient records Bideford was recorded as a borough; but it only returned members to Parliament during the reigns of Edward I (1272\u20131307) and Edward II (1307\u20131327).\n1500\u20131700.\nThe Grenville family were for many centuries lords of the manor of Bideford and played a major role in the town's development. The monument with an effigy of Sir Thomas Grenville (died 1513) exists in St Mary's Church. His great-great-grandson Sir Richard Grenville (1542\u20131591), the captain of the \"Revenge\", was born in the manor house in Bideford, formerly situated on the site of numbers 1\u20133 Bridge Street. He built himself a new mansion on the quayside in 1585. The family had another seat at Stow House, Kilkhampton, near Bude in Cornwall. Grenville played a major role in the transformation of the small fishing port of Bideford in North Devon into what became a significant trading port with the new American colonies, later specialising in tobacco importation. In 1575 he created the Port of Bideford. Grenville was never elected as Mayor of Bideford, preferring instead to support John Salterne in that role, but he was Lord of the Manor, a title held by the Grenvilles since 1126 and finally ceded by his descendants in 1711 to the Town Council he established. On his return from Roanoke Colony Grenville's ship \"Tiger\" captured a Spanish galleon the \"Santa Maria de San Vicente\" off Bermuda in late August 1585. The Spanish prize was brought into Bideford with riches valued at around 15,000 pounds. Grenville also brought a Native American \"Wynganditoian\" from Roanoke Island with him after returning from a voyage to America in 1586. Grenville named this Native American tribesman Raleigh after his cousin Sir Walter Raleigh. Raleigh converted to Christianity and was baptised at Saint Mary's Church on 27 March 1588, but died from influenza during his residence in Grenville's house on 2 April 1589. His interment was at the same church five days later. Sir Richard Grenville's great-grandson, Sir John Granville, helped restore Charles II to the throne, and in 1661 Charles made Sir John Granville Baron Granville of Bideford and Earl of Bath.\nDuring the English Civil War, Bideford stood with the Parliamentarians against the Royalist forces of Charles I. Following a series of Royalist successes in the South West during 1643, the Parliamentarians withdrew into Bideford and its two small fortresses, one of which was Chudleigh Fort. Here they were besieged. After further Royalist victories it became clear that Bideford would not be relieved, and in August 1643 it was stormed by Royalist forces. Following fierce fighting around the two forts, the town fell.\nIn 1646, 229 people in the town were killed by the plague. It was suggested that a Spanish vessel laden with wool which docked at the quay may have brought this plague to Bideford, and that it was children playing with the wool who first got infected with the plague. Victims were buried from 8 June 1646 to 18 January the next year. After the revocation of the Edict of Nantes and the expulsion of French Protestants from France a considerable number of them immigrated to Bideford, and they brought a lot of new trades to the town, including silk weaving.\nIn the 16th century the merchant and ship owner John Strange was born in the town. When he was in his youth, he fell from a cliff yet did not suffer any injury, then later on in his life someone fired an arrow at his forehead, but it did not penetrate his skull, and the only lasting damage was a scar. Once a malicious person tried to throw him over the Long Bridge, the walls of the bridge being very low, but was unexpectedly and luckily interrupted.\nWitch trial.\nThe Bideford witch trial in 1682 involved three women, Temperance Lloyd, Mary Trembles and Susannah Edwards, accused of witchcraft and which resulted in one of the last hangings for witchcraft in England.\n1800\u20131939.\nIn 1816 a mob forced their way into Bideford prison to try and break out some of the mob's ringleaders, and soldiers from the Royal North Devon Yeomanry had to be mustered, and then patrolled the town, where they arrested several members of the mob who were then escorted to Exeter. In 1835 the Bideford Poor Law Union was founded; followed by the building, in 1837, of the Bideford workhouse in Meddon Street. The workhouse had a 40-bed infirmary and would later become Torridge Hospital and, eventually, a residential building. In 1830 it was reported that 5000 people waved farewell to ships leaving Bideford for New York City, Montreal, and St. Andrews (New Brunswick). Between the years 1840 and 1900 2,467 people emigrated to Canada and 248 to the United States aboard ships from Bideford. \nThe population of Bideford in the 1841 census was 3,830. There were 9 or 10 shipbuilding yards in the 1840s.\nIn 1847 a horse-drawn omnibus taking people to a fair in Torrington fell off Bideford Quay into the River Torridge, and eight people were drowned. The book \"Kingsley's County\" put the expansion and growth of Bideford down to the publication of Charles Kingsley's romance \"Westward Ho!\" in 1855. There was an extension of the London and South Western Railway from Barnstaple in 1856. The Pannier Market opened in 1884. In 1902 the first car arrived in Bideford: it was owned by Dr E.J. Toye, the car being a 4-1/2\u00a0hp Benz.\nWorld War II.\nIn 1942 American GIs arrived in Bideford. At first they were there to work in radar stations across North Devon and work on experimental things. More American troops began to arrive as the war progressed. Experiments nearby, including The Great Panjandrum, were said to be viewed in the area in secret by Dwight D. Eisenhower and Sir Winston Churchill at the Strand Cinema. In 1943 more Americans arrived as D-day training had begun at beaches across North Devon During the war Bideford Ordnance Experimental Station Depot O-617 was set up to experiment on waterproofing equipment for the D-day landings. The Americans' GI camp was at Bowden Green in Bideford, and had plenty of facilities, including a cinema. There was also a vehicle repair shop off the Kingsley Road, and the Pill was taken over by US forces as well. Because of the sheer number of American soldiers in the area by 1943 the American Red Cross opened a club near Chudleigh Fort in East-the-Water. Bideford had an Auxiliary Unit Patrol at Cleave Mine, the men of this patrol were expected to be the resistance if Britain was invaded. During the war 2700 evacuees were expected in Bideford; a large number of these came and stayed throughout the war. During World War II a bomb was dropped on a house in Bowden Green and caused substantial damage. Also during the war an RCAF bomber crashed in East the Water; three men were killed and one badly injured. A memorial has been put on the Tarka Trail to commemorate this. It is also thought that during the war there was an experimental Royal Navy unit testing a secret petrol pipeline in the river. It is thought that after being rescued in the Bristol Channel, some German airman were brought ashore at Bideford, where they were taken to Bideford Hospital. There was also a POW camp at Handy Cross. It has been discovered that the Nazis had a map of Bideford in readiness for a possible invasion, also that the Nazis had an aerial picture of the area for intelligence purposes.\nLong Bridge.\nThe original Long Bridge spanning the River Torridge connecting the East and West of the town was said to have been built out of timber in the year 1286. In 1474 the original structure was replaced by the masonry arch bridge seen today. The bridge was built around the timber so people could still use it while construction was taking place, possibly resulting in the 24 arches all being of different sizes. A traditional explanation is that each arch was funded by a different local guild, although there are no records to confirm this. Another theory is that the piers of the arches of the bridge were built on naturally existing, and therefore randomly situated, large stones in the river. During the first decade of the 17th century, the bridge trustees were taken to court by the people of Bideford for feasting and seeing plays at the expense of the trust funds. The people won the court case, although it is unclear whether the trustees were forced to resign after the scandal, or whatever else happened to them. In 1790 the bridge was the longest in Devon. In the 1820s there was talk of converting the bridge so that it could be raised and lowered to allow larger boats and ships to pass under it. In 1886 a Ship called 'Edward Birkbeck' launched from a Bideford shipyard hit the bridge, but only caused small damage by knocking some of the stones out. In 1925 another incident took place on the bridge: during the widening of the bridge a lorry came off the side of the bridge and crashed into the River Torridge, and it is believed that both the people in the lorry survived. During World War II the 10th arch of the bridge was being repaired, and the police asked for ladders and scaffolding to be removed from the bridge to prevent potential invaders climbing up and capturing the bridge. During the war the Home Guard patrolled the bridge. The Bideford Bridge Trust held responsibility for the long bridge right up until the year 1968 when one of the arches of the bridge collapsed. The Department of Transport then took over the bridge. During the rebuilding of that damaged part of the bridge a crane toppled over, and a man was killed. An inspection by Devon County Council in July 2007 revealed problems with the bridge's concrete and structure, so in September 2008 work began on putting in the cathodic protection system which restored the bridge for another 60 years. A sight which many holiday-makers and locals enjoy is seeing the starlings at dusk, as they roost underneath the bridge.\nPort and shipping.\nBy the 16th century Bideford had become Britain's third largest port. Sir Walter Raleigh landed his first shipment of tobacco here, although, contrary to popular belief, he was not the first to import tobacco to England. Several local roads and a hill have been named after Raleigh. Bideford was heavily involved in the transport of indentured servants to the New World colonies. Bideford also was heavily involved in the Newfoundland cod trade from the 16th century to the mid-18th century. 28 Bideford vessels with a tonnage of 3860 were involved in this practice in the year 1700. In the years 1706, 1707, 1726 and 1758 fishermen of Bideford sent petitions demanding the building of a fort in Newfoundland to protect them from Native Americans and the French. Bideford also imported large amounts of Irish wool in the 18th century.\nTwo prominent shipbuilders in Bideford were George Crocker and Richard Chapman: they built a large number of ships. A number of ships have been built in Bideford, including HMS \"Acorn\", an 18-gun sloop launched in 1807; and , , and HMS \"Ontario\", which were all 18-gun s, and were both 22-gun Royal Navy \"Laurel\"-class post ships, and HMS \"Meda\", a harbour defence motor launch was built and launched in the town. Around 150 ships were built between 1840 and 1877 at Higher Cleave Houses in Bideford. The largest wooden ship to be built in Bideford was the \"Sarah Newman\", a 1,004-ton full-rigged ship built in 1855. During the 19th century over 815 registered wooden sailing ships were launched on the Torridge, as too were hundreds of unregistered craft. Shipbuilding in the Bideford area declined during the 1890s as shipyards in Britain's industrial regions constructed steel steamships. The last wooden merchant ship launched in the River Torridge was the schooner \"PT Harris\" from the Hubbastone yard of PK Harris &amp; Sons, in 1912.\nDuring World War II a was named , also four sixth-rate ships of the line have been named after the town. Nowadays the only shipbuilding in the area is at Appledore Shipbuilders, which has built civilian ships and ships for the Royal Navy and Irish Naval Service. Currently ball clay is exported from Bideford to Castell\u00f3n, Spain and also Naantali, Finland; also wood has been exported to Wismar, Germany. The , the last remaining British-built wooden-hull three-masted topsail schooner, is registered in Bideford and was at one time based there. There are also some fishing boats that still operate out of Bideford.\nLate 20th century.\nIn 1966, Bideford Zoo was built by Mrs K. Tottenham and opened on the 29th May 1966. The original inhabitants included sea lions, bears and raccoons. It finally closed in October 1970. The site is now a housing estate, and the old zoo house known as \"Ford House\" has now been converted into flats.\nLiterary references.\nThis area of North Devon was home to the author Charles Kingsley, and is where he based his novel \"Westward Ho!\". A small seaside town, named after the book, was built after the book's publication.\nWestward Ho!, the only town in the United Kingdom which officially contains an exclamation mark in its name, is approximately three miles (5\u00a0km) from Bideford. A statue was erected in honour of Kingsley near the car park of Victoria Park.\nNamesakes.\nThe city of Biddeford, Maine, in the United States was named after the English town, using the original old English spelling. Also, the town of Bideford in the province of Prince Edward Island, Canada, is named after the English town, as is the small town of Bideford, New Zealand.\nBideford Black.\nBideford Black is a unique pigment which was mined for 200 years up until 1969 in Bideford and the surrounding area. The deposits were formed 350\u00a0million years ago during the Carboniferous period on Gondwana. Bideford Black contains carbon, silica and alumina, with the black colouration created by the carbon. The seams containing Bideford Black Stretch from Hartland, underneath Bideford, and onto Umberleigh. Bideford Black was used in a number of ways; for example, it was used as camouflage paint during World War II, in mascara by Max Factor, by artists, and in the boat-building industry. Bideford Black was processed as a paint and a dye up until the mining stopped. A number of artists (mainly local artists) used these Bideford Black paints and oils in their works. The Bideford Black Mining Company produced Biddiblack powder at a processing plant in Chapel Park, East-the-Water. Some of the miners' houses were situated at Springfield Terrace, East-the-Water.\nThe mining of the pigment became unviable when other blacks went into large, cheap commercial production. Bideford Black has also been known as \"The Mother of Coal\"; there are still a number of places where evidence of the mine can be seen, like old mine entrances just off the Barnstaple road. A number of roads are named after the mining in the town, including Mines Road, Pitt Lane, Biddiblack Way and other roads.\nRecently some Bideford Black was exchanged, by locals, for some pigments provided by Australian Aboriginal Elder Noel Butler. Noel Butler's nephew has used the Bideford Black to paint his body for Aboriginal ceremonial events in Australia. The Heritage lottery fund has given a grant of \u00a38700 to the Burton Art Gallery to fund research into Bideford Black. In October 2013 a display about Bideford Black was presented at Bideford's Burton Art Gallery.\nDemography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Module:Historical populations/styles.css\"/&gt;\nIn 2011 government statistics recorded the population at 17,107, its highest ever. Between 2011 and 2026 Bideford's population was expected to rise by 9,689 people. The birth rate in Bideford is 60.2 out of 1000 women, compared with the 52.8 per 1000 women which is the average for Devon. Life expectancy in Bideford is 80.7 years, that is 0.9 years less than the average for Devon. Bideford has the highest rate of youth offending in Devon at 21.5 in 1000 people, compared with 13.2 in a 1000 people as the Devon average.\nBideford is largely ethnically homogenous, with the 2001 census reporting that 98.3% of the population were white in the parish. 3.3% of school children are from ethnic minorities and 0.9% of school children do not have English as their first language, the lowest in Devon. In 2001 31.6% of households were classed as \"single person households\". In 2004 Bideford was classed as one of the most deprived areas in the Torridge area. In November 2008 1.95% of the population claimed job-seekers allowance. Domestic violence rates are 2.6% higher than the Devon average, alcohol-related crime is 0.4% higher than the Devon average, and drugs-related crime is the same as the Devon average.\nTransport.\nRoads.\nBideford is served by the A39 Atlantic Highway and A386 roads.\nFerry.\nA ferry operates between Bideford quay and Lundy Island, approximately away in the Bristol Channel. The same ship, the MS \"Oldenburg\", also provides evening cruises downstream from Bideford along the River Torridge.\nSouth West Coast Path.\nThe South West Coast Path National Trail runs through the town, and gives access to the North Devon coast.\nBuses.\nBus services are provided by Stagecoach South West; key routes include:\nRailway.\nThe nearest railway station is at Barnstaple away. Bideford was previously connected to the national rail network, but the connection was lost in 1982 (by then a freight branch, which was still operating due to the mining of ball clay traffic from Meeth Quarry) with the closure of the line from Barnstaple to Torrington and Meeth Quarry. Passenger services were closed in 1965 following the publication of the Beeching Report. The station still exists at East-the-Water and is now managed by a preservation group, the Bideford Railway Heritage Centre. The line followed the contours of the River Torridge for much of its route to Torrington and most of it is part of the Tarka Trail.\nIn 2009, \"James May's Toy Stories\" attempted to run OO gauge trains on a temporary track on the right of way. A subsequent attempt in 2011 was successful.\nIn 2009 the Association of Train Operating Companies costed reopening the Barnstaple to Bideford route at \u00a380 million. But in 2010 Devon County Council rejected proposals by Torridge District Council to consider reopening.\nBideford, Westward Ho! and Appledore Railway.\nThe Bideford, Westward Ho! and Appledore Railway was an unusual and short-lived railway built entirely on this peninsula with no direct connection to the rest of the British railway network. The locomotives were fitted with skirts to protect pedestrians, as at one point the line ran along the quay at Bideford. The line had eleven halts which largely served visitors wishing to enjoy the scenery along the coast or the beaches around Westward Ho!. The railway, although authorised in 1896, was opened only as far as Northam by 1901, and finally reached Appledore in 1908.\nThe railway fell into financial difficulties and in the First World War, the War Department requisitioned all of its equipment for use in France. Bideford's 13th-century Long Bridge was temporarily converted into a railway bridge to carry the locomotives and rolling stock onto the main line railway near Bideford Station.\nClimate.\nBideford has a wet but mild climate; during the winter Bideford experiences a lot of changeable weather conditions, mild cloudy/ drizzly weather off the Atlantic with daytime temperatures typically 11/12c and mild nights in high single figures, alternating with clear periods which can allow for frosty nights and early mornings with temperatures-2/-4c and maybe only 4-5c by day: Bideford also gets some snow but it rarely settles for long. During the summer Bideford can experience wet and unsettled weather off the Atlantic but also can be one of the warmest places in Devon when warm continental air masses move up off the continent and in 2022 a short heatwave around 17\u201318 July produced record warmth with temperatures pushing 35c and overnight lows in the high teens.\nEast-the-Water.\nThe town of Bideford has grown to cover land on both sides of the River Torridge; the area located east of the river is known as East-the-Water and also spelled East the Water without hyphens. Much of the land that has been built on in recent years is drained marshland.\nEast-the-Water has its own primary school, local shops, a few factories, approximately 3 bars and pubs, a small health centre and a small industrial area consisting largely of locally owned businesses. It is mainly public housing, especially on the Pollyfield estate. The community also has its own community centre and association, both of which are self-funding and run by a committee of local residents. A key historical feature is Chudleigh Fort, built by the Parliamentarian Major-General James Chudleigh during the English Civil War. The area is surrounded by agricultural land.\nBuried in the now abandoned and neglected East-the-Water Cemetery in adjacent plots are Victoria Cross recipients Gerald Graham and George Channer.\nGovernance.\nBideford Town Council, which is based at Bideford Town Hall, has 16 seats representing four unequal wards, North, South, East and South Outer. At the May 2011 local elections, seven Conservatives, three independents, two Liberal Democrats, two Labour and one Green were elected (there was one vacant seat). There is a mayor and Town Clerk. The town council received widespread attention in February 2012 when the High Court ruled that prayers as part of meetings were not lawful by the Local Government Act 1972.\nTorridge District Council is the next level of local government and most decisions are made by Devon County Council. Torridge District Council is responsible for maintaining Bideford Higher Cemetery.\nThe local MP is the Conservative Geoffrey Cox. The two Devon County Council councillors who represent the town are Anthony Inch and Linda Hellyer, they are both members of the Conservative Party.\nEducation.\nState-funded primary schools in Bideford include East-the-Water Primary School, St. Mary's Church of England Primary School and Westcroft School. Bideford College is the main state-funded secondary school serving the area.\nKingsley School is a co-educational independent school situated in Bideford. It was founded in 2009 when Grenville College and Edgehill College merged. It is a member of the Methodist Independent Schools trust.\nReligion.\nBideford has a number of churches:\nIn 2011, 61.8% of people in Bideford and nearby Northam described themselves as Christian, 0.3% as Buddhist, 0.2% as Muslims and 0.7% were classed as part of the other religion category. The number of religious people in the area is higher than the average in Devon.\nCulture.\nNew Year traditions.\nBideford is renowned for its New Year's Eve celebrations, when thousands of people \u2013 most in fancy dress \u2013 from surrounding towns, villages, and around the world gather on the quay for revelries and a fireworks display. The event normally includes a number of local musical acts performing on the X Radio One Roadshow stage.\nAndrew's Dole is a custom dating from 1605. In that year, the Mayor of Bideford, Andrew Dole, established a trust to provide for loaves of bread to be distributed to poor, elderly, persons who applied at the Mayor's Parlour. The custom continues to this day and takes place on New Year's Day. He also left some land to trustees and the income is distributed to 10 deserving people, for each trustee.\nRadio.\nLocal radio was provided by Heart North Devon. The station, which started in 1992 and originally called Lantern FM, was based in Bideford in a building named \"the Lighthouse\", and later moved to an industrial estate in nearby Barnstaple. In April 2009, the station was rebranded as part of the Heart Network, losing the long-standing Lantern FM name. In August 2010, amid much controversy, the station was merged with its sister operations in other areas of Devon and all operations were moved to new studios in Exeter and renamed Heart Devon. As a result, numerous members of staff at Barnstaple were made redundant. Since then, many of the Lantern FM team, past and present, have reunited to create The Voice, a local radio station currently broadcasting across Devon on DAB Digital radio. The radio station was launched on FM in January 2014 after being granted an FM Licence.\nTelevision.\nLocal news and television programmes are provided by BBC South West and ITV West Country. Television signals are received from the Huntshaw Cross TV transmitter and the local relay transmitter situated in Westward Ho!.\nNewspapers.\nBideford is covered by two main local newspapers, the \"North Devon Gazette\" and the \"North Devon Journal\" which are published weekly. The \"Gazette\" was founded in Bideford, and was originally known as the \"Bideford Gazette\". It is now a free newspaper, delivered to most local homes, and is now based in Barnstaple. The regional daily paper, the \"Western Morning News\", is also available. A local newsletter, the \"Bideford Buzz\", was published monthly from 2000- 18 by a team of volunteers, and from October 2018 is available online only.\nTwinning.\nThe town is twinned with Landivisiau in France. It has been twinned with Landivisiau since 1976; each year members of the Bideford Twinning Association take part in an exchange trip with Landivisiau.\nOn 20 October 2006, British ex-patriate David Riley came to mark the '20-year link' between Manteo on Roanoke Island, North Carolina, and Bideford. The Bideford town clerk, George McLauchlan, told him that locals had never heard of Manteo, and that the only town Bideford was twinned with was in France. Mr Riley handed over a clock to 'celebrate' the twenty-year link, while the Manteo Town manager Kermit Skinner said the link started in the 1980s during the 400th anniversary of Raleigh's voyages to America.\nIt turns out the 'twinning' of Bideford with Manteo had been established 20 years before. But the story goes back much further \u2013 500 years \u2013 to the mysterious disappearance of a colony of more than 100 people on Roanoke Island, many of whom were immigrants from Bideford. The colony was established by Sir Richard Grenville, who brought back two Native American Indians, one of them called Manteo which gave the North Carolina town its name.\nArt.\nBideford Art School was located on The Quay from 1896 to the 1970s. Alumni included Judith Ackland and novelist Rosemary Sutcliff. Today the building houses Bideford Arts Centre. The Burton at Bideford is an art gallery and museum in the town that has collections on various things of interest connected with Bideford's heritage, including clay pipes and tea caddies. The art gallery displays work by local artists featuring local heritage and local landscapes.\nBideford Film Society.\nThe Bideford Film Society was set up in 2001 and with the aid of a grant from the Bridge Trust and Bideford Town Council. The Bideford Film Society shows films just after their cinema release. The films are screened at Kingsley School, or in the Devon Hall at Bideford College.\nMarkets.\nIn 1272 Bideford was granted a market charter, and has had many markets throughout the years. The medieval market was once held near to where the bottom of the High Street is today. The current Pannier Market has been there since 1884, and consists of a large market hall which, as well as markets, hosts boxing matches and other events; and Butchers Row which is now made up of small shops, galleries, and butchers' stalls.\nA farmers' market takes place on the quay on nearly every Saturday throughout the summer. A continental market also visits Bideford annually \u2013 market traders from France, Belgium, Italy, Spain, Holland, Poland and other countries come to sell products on the quay.\nShopping.\nBideford has many small shops and galleries. Affinity Devon, formerly Atlantic Village, is an outlet shopping centre on the western outskirts of the town: it has over thirty retail outlets Opposite Affinity Devon is Atlantic Park, a collection of restaurants, supermarkets and hotel chains built in 2015. This destroyed large parts of Moreton Park Woods and was campaigned against by local residents.\nSport and recreation.\nBideford has two King George's Fields, which are memorials to King George V. One field is used primarily as the home ground of the main local rugby union club, Bideford RFC (Chiefs) who currently play in Counties 1 Western West.\nThe other field, commonly referred to as \"The Sports Ground\", is the home to Bideford AFC, the town's main local football club, they currently play in the Southern Football League Division One South and are managed by Sean William Joyce.\nEast-the-Water also has its own football club, Shamwickshire Rovers FC, which plays at Pollyfield.\nThere is a cricket club in the park called Victoria Park Cricket Club, but there is also Bideford, Littleham and Westward Ho! Cricket Club and they play in Westward Ho!\nThere are two bowling clubs in the town, one is Bideford Bowling Club who play near to The Sports Ground, and the other is Bideford Victoria Park Bowling Club.\nThere is also a gymnastics club in the town called the North Devon Display Gymnastic Club.\nIn 2009 the sixth stage of the Tour of Britain finished in the town, and large crowds lined the quay where it finished. In 2012 the Tour of Britain passed through the town, again large crowds came out to watch.\nOn 19 March 2012 the 2012 Olympic torch relay passed through the town, when large crowds lined the town's streets, and school children from the town's schools were also allowed to line the route \u2013 even though it was during the school day.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It was released in the United Kingdom on 22 November 1963 on Parlophone, eight months after the release of the band's debut album, \"Please Please Me\". Produced by George Martin, the album features eight original compositions (seven by Lennon\u2013McCartney and \"Don't Bother Me\", George Harrison's first recorded solo composition) and six covers (mostly of rock and roll and Motown R&amp;B hits). The sessions also yielded the non-album single, \"I Want to Hold Your Hand\" backed by \"This Boy\". The cover photograph was taken by the fashion photographer Robert Freeman and has since been mimicked by several music groups. A different cover was used for the Australian release of the album, which the Beatles were displeased with.\nIn the United States, the album's tracks were unevenly split over the group's first two albums released on Capitol Records: \"Meet the Beatles!\" and \"The Beatles' Second Album\". It was also released in Canada under the name \"Beatlemania! With the Beatles\". The album was ranked number 420 on \"Rolling Stone\" magazine's list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time in 2003, and was included in Robert Dimery's \"1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die\" (2010). It was also voted number 275 in the third edition of English writer Colin Larkin's \"All Time Top 1000 Albums\" (2000).\nRecording.\nIn 1963, musical groups were typically required to release more than one LP a year. As such, the Beatles' producer George Martin and manager Brian Epstein planned for the band to release two LPs and four singles every year. Shortly after recording the non-album single \"She Loves You\" on 1 July 1963, the Beatles returned to London's EMI Studios only four months after the release of \"Please Please Me\". Unlike their debut, the bulk of whose tracks (10 of the 14, excluding previously issued singles) were recorded in one day, \"With the Beatles\" was recorded over seven sessions across three months. On 18 July, the group tracked four covers: Smokey Robinson's \"You Really Got a Hold on Me\", Barrett Strong's \"Money (That's What I Want)\", the Donays' \"Devil in His Heart\", albeit retitled \"Devil in Her Heart\", and Meredith Willson's \"Till There Was You\", although this recording was deemed unsatisfactory.\nThe Beatles reconvened at the studio on the morning of 30 July, recording a cover of the Marvelettes' \"Please Mr. Postman\" and beginning work on the first new Lennon\u2013McCartney song, \"It Won't Be Long\". Following a break to record a BBC radio session for \"Saturday Club\", they returned in the late-afternoon, recording overdubs on \"Money\", a remake of \"Till There Was You\" and a cover of Chuck Berry's \"Roll Over Beethoven\". The session ended with finishing touches on \"It Won't Be Long\" and recording Paul McCartney's \"All My Loving\", which Beatles historian Mark Lewisohn described as \"by far his best, most complex piece of songwriting yet.\" \"She Loves You\", backed by \"I'll Get You\", was issued as a single on 23 August and was the group's first single to sell over a million copies in Britain alone.\nAfter a break, the Beatles returned to EMI on 11 September 1963. They attempted John Lennon's \"Little Child\" and drummer Ringo Starr's vocal contribution to the album, \"I Wanna Be Your Man\", a Lennon\u2013McCartney original that was given to the Rolling Stones, who released it as their second single; both attempts were deemed unsatisfactory. The group started and finished Lennon's compositions \"All I've Got to Do\" and \"Not a Second Time\", and began recording Harrison's first solo composition, \"Don't Bother Me\", which was also left unfinished. The next day, the band remade \"Hold Me Tight\", which was attempted earlier in the year on 11 February, finished \"Little Child\" and \"Don't Bother Me\", but again left \"I Wanna Be Your Man\" unfinished. On 30 September, Martin added piano and Hammond organ overdubs to \"Money\" and \"I Wanna Be Your Man\", respectively, while the band were on holidays. The band returned on 3 October, recording more takes of \"I Wanna Be Your Man\".\nFour-track recording was installed at EMI before the 17 October session, when the Beatles recorded their new non-album single, \"I Want to Hold Your Hand\" / \"This Boy\", as well as speeches for a Christmas record for the band's fan club. The band finished up \"I Wanna Be Your Man\" on 23 October before Martin commenced mono and stereo mixing the same day and continuing six days later. Final preparations were made on 30 October, with the album officially completed on 4 November.\nPackaging.\nImpressed with Robert Freeman's black-and-white pictures of John Coltrane, Epstein invited the photographer to create the cover image. Harrison later said that, whereas the cover of \"Please Please Me\" had been \"crap\", their second LP was \"the beginning of us being actively involved in the Beatles' artwork... the first one where we thought, 'Hey, let's get artistic.'\" The group asked Freeman to take inspiration from pictures their friend Astrid Kirchherr had taken in Hamburg between 1960 and 1962, featuring the band members in half-shadow and not smiling. To achieve this result, on 22 August 1963, Freeman photographed them in a dark corridor of the Palace Court Hotel in Bournemouth, where the band were playing a summer residency at the local Gaumont Cinema. To fit the square format of the cover, he put Starr in the bottom right corner, \"since he was the last to join the group. He was also the shortest\". McCartney described the result as \"very moody\", adding: \"people think he must have worked at [it] forever and ever. But it was an hour. He sat down, took a couple of rolls, and he had it.\" \nThe original concept was to paint the picture from edge to edge, with no bleeding, title or artist credit \u2013 a concept that went against music industry practice and was immediately vetoed by EMI. The first album to carry an edge-to-edge cover was the Rolling Stones' self-titled debut, released five months later. EMI also objected to the fact that the Beatles were not smiling; it was only after George Martin intervened, as head of Parlophone, that the cover portrait was approved. Freeman was paid \u00a375 for his work, which was three times the fee first offered by EMI.\nMusic critic John Harris finds the cover most reminiscent of the photos Kirchherr took in Hamburg of Lennon, Harrison and Stuart Sutcliffe using the \"half-lit technique\" and says that, together with songs such as \"Roll Over Beethoven\" and \"Money (That's What I Want)\", \"With the Beatles\" thereby represents \"a canny repackaging of their early '60s incarnation: Hamburg shorn of Prellies and leather, and sold to their public as a mixture of accomplished rock 'n' roll and art-house cool\". Harris also sees the LP cover as a \"watershed\" design that encouraged other acts to eschew \"the more cartoonish aspects of pop photography\" and continued to exert an influence in the 1970s on covers such as those for Lou Reed's \"Transformer\" (1972), Patti Smith's \"Horses\" (1975) and various punk rock albums.&lt;ref name=\"Harris/Mojo\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;\nEMI Australia did not receive the cover art (there were union restrictions on importing negatives for printing) and used different shots of the band in a similar style to the black-and-white photograph on other releases. The Beatles were unaware of this until fans showed them the cover during their only Australian tour, and informed the EMI publicity staff that they were not pleased with the substitution.\nThe same photo with a blue tint was used for the cover of the US release \"Meet The Beatles!\"\nRelease and reception.\nParlophone issued \"With the Beatles\" on 22 November 1963, eight months to the day after \"Please Please Me\", with the catalogue number PMC 1206. The album became the first Beatles album released in North America when it was released in Canada on 25 November 1963 under the augmented title \"Beatlemania! With the Beatles\", with additional text on the album cover, and issued only in mono at the time, catalogue number T 6051 (a stereo Canadian release would come in 1968, catalogue number ST 6051). For the United States release, the original running order of \"With the Beatles\" was unevenly split over the group's first two Capitol albums: nine tracks were issued on \"Meet the Beatles!\" (the eight original compositions plus \"Till There Was You\"), while the remaining five songs, all cover versions, were placed on \"The Beatles' Second Album\".\nThe LP had advance orders of a half million and sold another half million by September 1965, making it the second album to sell a million copies in the United Kingdom, after the soundtrack to the 1958 film \"South Pacific\". \"With the Beatles\" remained at the top of the charts for 21 weeks, displacing \"Please Please Me\", so that the Beatles occupied the top spot for 51 consecutive weeks. It even reached number 11 in the \"singles charts\" (because at the time UK charts counted all records sold, regardless of format). No other group or singer has achieved 51 consecutive weeks at number 1 in the album charts. However, the soundtrack for \"South Pacific\" did achieve 70 consecutive weeks at number one in the album charts. Reviewing the album on release for \"Record Mirror\", Peter Jones hailed \"With the Beatles\" as an improvement over \"Please Please Me\", praising the covers and originals, particularly Harrison's \"Don't Bother Me\".\nOn 26 February 1987, \"With the Beatles\" was officially released on compact disc (in mono only, catalogue number CDP 7 46436 2). Having been available only as an import in the US in the past, the album was also issued domestically in the US on LP and cassette on 21 July 1987. Along with the rest of the Beatles' canon, it was re-released on CD in newly re-mastered stereo and mono versions on 9 September 2009.\nThe album was ranked number 420 on \"Rolling Stone\" magazine's list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time in 2003, and was included in Robert Dimery's \"1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die\". It was voted number 275 in the third edition of English writer Colin Larkin's \"All Time Top 1000 Albums\". It was rated the 29th greatest album in the book \"Paul Gambaccini Presents the Top 100 Albums\". This book \"canvassed a panel of experts in seven countries\" to determine the greatest albums.\nPersonnel.\nAccording to Mark Lewisohn:\nThe Beatles\nProduction\nCertifications and sales.\n\u2020 BPI certification awarded only for sales since 1994.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Accius was born in 170 BC at Pisaurum, a town founded in the Ager Gallicus in 184 BC. He was the son of a freedman and a freedwoman, probably from Rome.\nThe year of his death is unknown, but he must have lived to a great age, since Cicero (born 106 BC, hence 64 years younger) writes of having conversed with him on literary matters.\nLiterary works.\nAccius was a prolific writer and enjoyed a very high reputation. The titles and considerable fragments (about 700 lines) of some fifty plays have been preserved. Judging from the titles and fragments, scholars have surmised that most, if not all, of these poems were tragic in nature, although Pliny the Younger ranks him among the erotic poets. His career as a poet can be traced over the course of 36 years from B.C. 140, to B.C. 104.\nMost of his poetical works were imitations or free translations of the Greek, especially Aeschylus. The earliest of these was most likely the \"Atreus\", which was performed in 140, but is now lost. He also wrote on some Roman subjects, one of which, an examination of the tyranny of L.\u00a0Tarquinius Superbus and his expulsion by Lucius Junius Brutus, was titled \"Brutus\", and was probably written in honor of his patron D. Brutus. His favorite subjects were the legends of the Trojan War and the house of Pelops. While only fragments remain, the most important of which were preserved by Cicero, they seem sufficient to justify the terms of admiration in which Accius is spoken of by the ancient writers. He is particularly praised for the strength and vigor of his language, and the sublimity of his thoughts. Although the grandiloquence of his literary style was on occasion mocked by some of his peers, he continued to be cited by other writers long after his death.\nAccius wrote other works of a literary character: \"Libri Didascalicon\", a treatise in verse on the history of Greek and Roman poetry, and dramatic art in particular; also \"Libri Pragmaticon\", \"Parerga\", and \"Praxidica\", of which no fragments remain; and a hexameter \"Annales\" containing the history of Rome, like that of Ennius.\nAs a grammarian.\nAccius also attempted to introduce innovations in Latin orthography and grammar, most of which were attempts to change written Latin to more faithfully reproduce its actual pronunciation. Few of these caught on, although his preference against giving Greek names Latin endings had quite a few supporters, particularly Varro, who dedicated his \"De antiquitate litterarum\" to Accius.\nA spelling convention of writing long vowels double (such as \"aa\" for long \"\u0101\") is also associated with him and is found in texts concurrent with his lifetime.\nPolitics and temperament.\nAccius was politically conservative, and generally noted for his dignity and reserve. He did, however, believe that one with literary gifts, such as himself, ought to be accorded more respect than someone who, through no effort of their own, was merely born into the nobility. He was, by some accounts, a self-important man, and some writers expressed a wry amusement at the larger-than-life statues of himself that he had erected in the temple of the Muses.\nA fragment of Accius' play \"Atreus\" features the line \"\" (\"let them hate, so long as they fear\").\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nGeneral sources.\nThe cited also includes these authorities:"}
