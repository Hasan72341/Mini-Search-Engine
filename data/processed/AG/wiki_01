The Renaissance ch\u00e2teaux which they built new or erected on the foundations of old fortresses earned this part of the Loire Valley the nickname \"The Garden of France.\" Chinon played an important and strategic role during the Middle Ages, serving both French and English kings.\nChinon is known for its wine, castle, and historic town. Its part of the Loire Valley has been registered as a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 2000.\nHistory.\nThe historic town of Chinon is on the banks of the river Vienne about from where it joins the Loire. Settlement in Chinon dates from prehistoric times, with a pronounced importance for both French and English history in the Middle Ages. At this period rivers were the main trade routes, and the Vienne joins both the fertile regions of the Poitou and the city of Limoges, and is a tributary of the Loire, which acted as a traffic thoroughfare. The site was fortified early on, and by the 5th\u00a0century a Gallo-Roman \"castrum\" had been established there.\nTowards the mid 5th century, a disciple of St Martin, St Mexme, established first a hermitage, and then a monastery to the east of the town. This religious foundation bearing his name flourished in the medieval period, being rebuilt and extended four times. The eventual complex contained a large and highly decorated church and a square of canons' residences. Closure and partial demolition during and after the Revolution of 1789 have damaged this once very important church. The imposing second fa\u00e7ade still stands, with its nave dating from the year 1000 AD. Its important remains have been restored as historical monument and a cultural centre.\nDuring the Middle Ages, Chinon further developed, especially under Henry II (Henry Plantagen\u00eat, Count of Anjou, crowned King of England in 1154). The castle was rebuilt and extended, becoming his administrative center and a favourite residence. It was where court was frequently held during the Angevin Empire.\nOn Henry's death at the castle in 1189, Chinon passed to his eldest surviving son from his marriage with Eleanor of Aquitaine, Richard I the Lionheart. On Richard's death in 1199, it passed to the youngest of their children, John Lackland. King John would lose the castle in a siege in 1205 to the French king Philip II Augustus, from which date it was included in the French royal estates as the royal duchy of Touraine.\nThe castle in Chinon served as a prison for a time when Philip IV the Fair ordered the Knights Templar arrested in 1307. Jacques de Molay, Grand Master, and a few other dignitaries of the Order of the Temple were incarcerated there prior to trial and eventual execution.\nChinon again played a significant role in the struggle for the throne between the French and the English during the Hundred Years' War (1337\u20131453) when the heir apparent, the future Charles VII of France sought refuge and installed his court there in 1425. The province remained faithful to him and he made lengthy stays with his court there. In 1429, the 17-year-old Joan of Arc came to Chinon to meet and to acknowledge him as the rightful heir to the throne. After interrogation to prove she had been sent on a mission from God and with the men and arms then accorded to her, she would go on to break the siege of Orl\u00e9ans in June and open the way for Charles to be crowned at Reims in July 1429. The meetings in Chinon with the future Charles VII of France and his acceptance of her constituted the turning point of the war, helping to establish both firmer national boundaries and sentiment.\nChinon also served Louis XII as he waited for the papal legate Cesare Borgia to bring the annulment papers from Jeanne de France, enabling him to marry Anne of Brittany in 1498, and thus solidifying an even more coherent French territory.\nIn 1490, the commune of Chinon was the birthplace of the writer, humanist, humorist, philosopher and satirist Fran\u00e7ois Rabelais, author of \"Gargantua and Pantagruel\" amongst other works, which figure in the canon of great world literature. The region is the scene of these fantastic, critical and observant adventures.\nFrom the 16th century, Chinon was no longer a royal residence, and in 1631 it became part of the estates of the Duke of Richelieu, who neglected the fortress. Apart from townhouses and convents that were built, the city changed little up to the Revolution. In the 1820s, however, the fortifications were pulled down and the banks of the river Vienne were opened up to the outside.\nIn the late 19th and 20th centuries, Chinon grew to the east, towards the railway station, and to the north on the hill. The historic centre was registered as a conservation area in 1968, and since that time has been undergoing restoration in order to preserve its historic, natural and architectural identity.\nGeography.\nChinon is located in the heart of the \"Val de Loire\", 47\u00a0km (29 miles) southwest of Tours and 305\u00a0km (189 miles) south west of Paris. It extends on both the banks of the Vienne, with the historic town mainly on the northern bank, at the foot of the medieval castle.\nChinon's importance derives in great part from its geographical position, located on the Vienne just before it joins the Loire. From prehistoric times, rivers acted as the principal trade routes, and the Vienne not only joins the fertile southern plains of the Poitou and the city of Limoges, but joining the Loire, gives access to both the seaport in Nantes and the \u00cele-de-France Paris region, thus providing not only a natural protective barrier, but a source of wealth.\nThe natural rocky outcrop that dominates the northern bank provides not only a natural fort and defensive position; it also acts as protection from flooding.\nPopulation.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Module:Historical populations/styles.css\"/&gt;\nWine.\nCarved into the banks of the Vienne River are the \"caves\", or wine cellars, for Chinon's well-known Cabernet Franc-based red wines.\nMonuments.\nThe historic town.\nThe historic town of Chinon presents an interesting architectural ensemble, from the Middle Ages and the beginning of the Renaissance when the Loire Valley was the seat of the king's court.\nTopography has played a major role: the formerly fortified town was developed at the foot of the castle on the rocky outcrop, protecting the northern side, with the Vienne River in the south. Apart from the natural defensive protection on both sides, this fact makes a long narrow urban space, with the main streets running parallel to the river.\nThe town was developed on both sides of the river: the fortified town at the base of the castle; the canons' quarter to the east; and on the other bank a suburb on the way to the southern regions of the Poitou, important to the 12th century Plantagenets.\nThe former fortified town at the foot of the castle contains a significant collection of old houses and narrow streets, including some half timber houses dating from the end of the 14th or the 15th centuries. The majority of the houses line the main street of this quarter, the rue Voltaire that then becomes the rue Haute Saint Maurice, originally Gallo-Roman, and also presents a number of \"h\u00f4tels particuliers\", or town manor houses, some with graceful turrets, winding staircase towers, and decorative elements form the end of the 15th or the beginning of the 16th century. Others, more sober and classical, date from the following periods, with some fine examples from the 17th and 18th centuries.\nThis street continues on past the church of Saint Maurice to its end where it was formerly enclosed by the fortifications. It also, at the main crossroads of the \"Grand Carroi\", offered the only access to the castle from within the town, and is the street that Joan of Arc took to go up and meet the future Charles VII in 1429.\nThe stone houses are made of the local tufa stone, a soft luminous limestone, easy to carve and lending itself to the often ornate sculpted decorations of the late Gothic and early Renaissance period. The roofs are of slate, another particular regional architectural element.\nThe quarter to the east was enclosed as well. It too lost these elements in the 1820s in an effort to open the town up to circulation and commerce. In this quarter one finds the parish church of Saint Etienne, and further the canons' quarter of the collegiate church of Saint Mexme. Here the houses are often larger, some presenting courtyards and gardens, dating from the late 15th century and on, a few fine examples of which were the canons' residences. To the south one can join the promenade along the river, or go up the rocky slope north east to the Chapelle Sainte-Radegonde.\nThe quarters of the former fortified town and that of Saint Etienne-Saint Mexme are divided by what was the only open space during the Middle Ages which was developed in the 18th and 19th centuries, and the architectural elements date from this period. It now presents a square sheltered by trees with outdoor restaurants tables.\nThe town of Chinon also offers an unusual variety of perspectives, allowing one to take its measure in several ways: from the bank opposite the castle, or river by boat, from which one can fully see the architectural presence and importance of its castle and town; from the interior of the historic town itself; and from the rocky outcrop, either from the castle itself, or along the high narrow roads along it that lead past semi-troglodytic homes and caves to the chapel of Saint Radegonde, giving a panoramic view of the historic town and the valley that opens up on the other side of the river.\nChinon is also a participant in the Loire Valley cycling tourism circuit.\nCollegiate church of Saint-Mexme.\nSaint Mexme is the patron saint of Chinon, credited with having saved the town and its inhabitants in the 5th century from dying of thirst during a siege with a massive rain and thunder storm. This moment is depicted in one of the stained glass windows of the apse in the church of Saint Etienne in Chinon by the atelier Lobin in the 19th century.\nThe hermitage, then monastery founded by Saint Mexme was destroyed in the 10th century, thus requiring reconstruction around the year 1000 AD. It is at this date that it became a collegiate church. Its importance was confirmed not only by its architecture, but that it was subject directly to the Holy See in Rome.\nThe collegiate church of Saint Mexme was the main religious edifice of the town until the Revolution when it was deconsecrated. A lack of necessary upkeep would lead to its partial collapse in 1817. The remaining largely Romanesque church retains its first fa\u00e7ade, now found in the interior, and its nave, both from the year 1000 AD. The nave is characterized by its horizontal lines: rows of large arcades and a series of high windows topped by a string course and a timber ceiling. Remains of richly painted decoration from the period subsist around the upper windows and in the northern arcade. It is now a Historical Monument, and since 2002 it has housed a small wooden frame theatre used for musical and theatrical events.\nThe imposing fa\u00e7ade, or west front, actually the second one built, dates from 1050 AD. It has a central portion, once richly decorated with carved stones depicting figuratives scenes that were largely mutilated during the Revolution, flanked by two side towers partially rebuilt in the 15th century. Some decorative interlacing and plant motifs can still be seen. This second fa\u00e7ade was most likely architecturally influential in the region at the time. It forms, with the first fa\u00e7ade from the year 1000 AD conserved in the interior, a narthex with a large barrel-vault with semicircular arches; the walls present blind arcades. Visible in the south chapel are some 15th-century paintings that have been conserved, notably a \"Last Judgement\", and a rare \"Fountain of Pity\". A very fine 18th-century open-newel winding stone staircase leads from the narthex to the upper floor. The upper gallery contains mural paintings from the 13th century, and a rare and imposing crucifixion carved in stone near the top of the first fa\u00e7ade also dating from the 1st millennium. In 2006, the window openings were embellished with stained glass, following the designs of the painter Olivier Debr\u00e9. They provide an unbroken view of the surrounding landscape.\nAround the collegiate church are several former canonical residences, dating from the Ancien R\u00e9gime.\nChapelle Sainte-Radegonde.\nThe Chapelle Sainte-Radegonde is half built into the rock face on the eastern outer limits of the town. During Antiquity, a natural underground spring at the back of the actual chapel was a site used for pagan worship. The site was Christianized in the 6th century when Queen Radegonde, later named a Saint, supposedly came to visit the hermit John who lived there. The name of the sanctuary comes from this event.\nTwo naves were created, starting in the 12th century. One is carved directly into the rock and the second made adjacent to it at a later date. The chapel conserves some mural paintings, notably the \"Royal Hunt\", made towards the end of the 12th century, the time of the power and residence of the Plantagenet family in Chinon. The fresco figures 5 riders, two of whom are crowned, and another with a bird of prey on his wrist. It has been presumed that it depicts members of the Plantagenet family in Chinon, the two crowned figures possibly being Henry II and Eleanor of Aquitaine, or their son Henry the Younger, crowned during his father's lifetime in 1170. In addition to its subject matter, this painting is of outstanding quality in its execution, its vivacity and the variety of colours.\nOther paintings, depicting the story of Saint Radegonde and Saint John, were made during the 17th century.\nThe chapel was deconsecrated following the Revolution and used as dwelling places. In 1878, it was bought and restored as a sanctuary by a benefactress of Chinon, Madame Charre.\nChurch of Saint Maurice.\nThe church of Saint Maurice is the parish church of the town, going thru several architectural evolutions. The oldest portion, the bell tower, is Romanesque, dating from the beginning of the 12th century. The nave and the choir both date from the end of the 12th century or beginning of the 13th, with Angevin Gothic style vaults. This style can be found in the Angevin territories, but not restricted to them. The vault is fairly bulbous in form, marked by very ornate sculptured and painted vault bosses, at the junction of the ribs and the capitols at the rib springs. A chapel from the 15th and a side aisle from the early 16th century mark the transition from Flamboyant Gothic to Renaissance architecture. The church was repainted in the 19th century, inspired by the restoration of the Sainte-Chapelle in Paris, and received new stained glass windows commissioned from the Atelier Lobin in Tours.\nThe church of Saint Maurice is the most likely location of Joan of Arc's prayer, while in Chinon in 1429.\nChurch of Saint \u00c9tienne.\nThe church of Saint Etienne, or Saint Stephen in English, is the parish church of the eastern quarter, not far from the collegiate church of Saint Mexme. It was completely reconstructed in the Flamboyant Gothic style, with the exception of the lower portion of the bell tower, in the 15th century. It has a large single aisle covered by ribbed vaults. The apse contains stained glass windows depicting scenes of religious importance in Chinon and the surrounding regions: the meeting of Queen and future Saint Radegonde and Saint John of Chinon in the 6th century; the miracle of Saint Mexme saving Chinon from a siege with a rain and thunder storm in the 5th century; the death of Martin of Tours in Candes-Saint-Martin in 397; and the meeting of Joan of Arc and the future Charles VII in 1429. They were produced on commission by the Atelier Lobin in Tours in the 19th century. It also houses the first statue of Joan of Arc in a church, placed there in 1900, two decades before her canonization.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He went into exile to London in 1795. He was furthermore ruler of the Principality of Orange-Nassau until his death in 1806. In that capacity, he was succeeded by his son William.\nEarly life.\nWilliam Batavus was born in The Hague on 8 March 1748, the only son of William IV, who had the year before been restored as stadtholder of the United Provinces. He was only three years old when his father died in 1751, and a long regency began. His regents were:\nWilliam was made the 568th Knight of the Order of the Garter in 1752.\nStadtholder.\nWilliam V assumed the position of stadtholder and Captain-General of the Dutch States Army on his majority in 1766. However, he allowed the Duke of Brunswick to retain a large influence on the government with the secret \"Acte van Consulentschap\". On 4 October 1767 in Berlin, Prince William married Princess Wilhelmina of Prussia, the daughter of Augustus William of Prussia, niece of Frederick the Great and a cousin of George III. (He himself was George III's first cousin). He became an art collector and in 1774 his \"Galerij Prins Willem V\" was opened to the public.\nThe position of the Dutch during the American War of Independence was one of neutrality. William V, leading the pro-British faction within the government, blocked attempts by pro-American, and later pro-French, elements to drag the government to war in support of the Franco-American alliance. However, things came to a head with the Dutch attempt to join the Russian-led League of Armed Neutrality, leading to the outbreak of the Fourth Anglo-Dutch War in 1780. In spite of the fact that Britain was engaged in fighting on several fronts, the war went badly for the Dutch, leading to the loss of the undefended Caribbean island of Sint Eustatius, a major supplier of contraband arms to the Americans, as well as Nagapattinam. Scandals like the Brest Affair undermined belief in the Dutch navy. The stadtholderian regime and the Duke of Brunswick were suspected of treason in the matter of the loss of the Barrier fortresses. The deterioration of the prestige of the regime made minds ripe for agitation for political reform, like the pamphlet Aan het Volk van Nederland, published in 1781 by Joan van der Capellen tot den Pol.\nAfter the signing of the Treaty of Paris (1783), there was growing restlessness in the United Provinces with William's rule. A coalition of old Dutch States Party \"regenten\" and democrats, called Patriots, was challenging his authority more and more. Mid September 1785 William left The Hague and removed his court to Het Loo Palace in Gelderland, a province remote from the political center. In September 1786 he sent States-Army troops to Hattem and Elburg to overthrow the cities' Patriot vroedschap, despite the defense by Patriot Free Corps, organised by Herman Willem Daendels. This provoked the Patriot-dominated States of Holland to deprive him of his office of Captain-General of the Army. (His function was given to Rhinegrave Salm.) In June 1787 his energetic wife Wilhelmina tried to travel to The Hague to foment an Orangist rising in that city. Outside Schoonhoven, she was stopped by the Gouda Free Corps, taken to a farm near Goejanverwellesluis and after a short detention made to return to Nijmegen.\nTo Wilhelmina and her brother, Frederick William II of Prussia, this was both an insult and an excuse to intervene militarily. Frederick launched the Prussian invasion of Holland in September 1787 to suppress the Patriots. Many Patriots fled to the North of France, around Saint-Omer, in an area where Dutch was spoken. Until his overthrow they were supported by King Louis XVI of France.\nExile in Great Britain and Ireland.\nWilliam V joined the First Coalition against Republican France in 1793 with the coming of the French Revolution. His troops fought in the Flanders Campaign, but in 1794 the military situation deteriorated and the Dutch Republic was threatened by invading armies. The year 1795 was a disastrous one for the \"ancien r\u00e9gime\" of the Netherlands. Supported by the French Army, the revolutionaries returned from Paris to fight in the Netherlands, and in 1795 William V went into exile in England. A few days later the Batavian Revolution occurred, and the Dutch Republic was replaced with the Batavian Republic. \nDirectly after his arrival in England, the Prince wrote a number of letters (known as the Kew Letters) from his new residence in Kew to the governors of the Dutch colonies, instructing them to hand over their colonies to the British as long as France continued to occupy the \"mother country\". Only a number complied, while those that demurred from doing so became confused and demoralised. Almost all Dutch colonies were eventually captured by the British, who in the end returned most, but not all (South Africa and Ceylon), first at the Treaty of Amiens and later with the Convention of London signed in 1814.\nIn 1799 the Hereditary Prince took an active part in the Anglo-Russian invasion of Holland, engineering the capture of a Batavian naval squadron in the Vlieter Incident. The surrender of the ships (that had been paid for by the Batavian Republic) was formally accepted in the name of William V as stadtholder, who was later allowed to sell them to the Royal Navy (for an appreciable amount). But that was his only success, as the troops suffered from choleric diseases, and civilians at that time were unwilling to re-instate the old regime. The arrogance of the tone in his proclamation, demanding the restoration of the stadtholderate, may not have been helpful, according to Simon Schama.\nAfter the Treaty of Amiens in 1802, in which Great Britain recognised the Batavian Republic, an additional Franco-Prussian Convention of 23 May 1802 declared that the House of Orange would be ceded in perpetuity the domains of Dortmund, Weingarten, Fulda and Corvey in lieu of its Dutch estates and revenues (this became the Principality of Nassau-Orange-Fulda). As far as Napoleon was concerned, this cession was conditional on the liquidation of the stadtholderate and other hereditary offices of the Prince. William V, however, had no interest in towns, territories and abbeys confiscated from other rulers, including alternatives as W\u00fcrzburg and Bamberg, but wanted what was his due: his arrears in salaries and other financial perquisites since 1795, or a lump sum of 4 million guilders. The foreign minister of the Batavian Republic, Maarten van der Goes, was willing to secretly try to persuade the \"Staatsbewind\" of the Batavian Republic to grant this additional indemnity, but Napoleon put a stop to it, when he got wind of the affair.\nThe last of the Dutch stadtholders, William V died in exile at his daughter's palace in Brunswick, now in Germany. His body was moved to the Dutch Royal Family crypt in the Nieuwe Kerk in Delft on 29 April 1958.\nIn 1813, his son, William VI returned to the Netherlands and proclaimed himself king, thus becoming the first Dutch monarch from the House of Orange.\nIssue.\nWilliam V and Wilhelmina of Prussia were the parents of five children:\nAppreciation.\nDuring his life and afterward, William V was a controversial person, in himself, and because he was the unwilling center of a political firestorm that others had caused. Many historians and contemporaries have written short appreciations of him that were often acerbic. Phillip Charles, Count of Alvensleben, who was the Prussian envoy to the Hague from 1787 (so not someone who must be suspected to be prejudiced against William) may be taken as an example. He wrote:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It was released in Japan in April 1978, and released overseas by Midway Manufacturing later that year. \"Space Invaders\" was the first video game with endless gameplay and the first fixed shooter, setting the template for the genre. The goal is to defeat waves of descending aliens with a horizontally moving laser cannon to earn as many points as possible. \nDesigner Tomohiro Nishikado drew inspiration from video games such as \"Gun Fight\" and \"Breakout\", electro-mechanical target shooting games, and science fiction narratives such as the novel \"The War of the Worlds\", the anime \"Space Battleship Yamato\", and the film \"Star Wars\". To complete development, he had to design custom hardware and development tools to use the features in microprocessor technology, which was new to him. Upon release, \"Space Invaders\" quickly became a commercial success worldwide; by 1982, it had grossed $3.8 billion ($ billion in 2024-adjusted terms), with a net profit of $450 million ($ billion in 2024 terms). This made it the best-selling video game and highest-grossing entertainment product at the time, and the highest-grossing video game yet.\n\"Space Invaders\" is considered one of the most influential and greatest video games ever, having ushered in the golden age of arcade video games and Japan's long-lasting global success in the video games industry. It inspired several prolific game designers to join the industry and influenced numerous games across different genres. The game has been ported and re-released in various forms, including the 1980 Atari 2600 version, which quadrupled sales of the Atari 2600 console and became the first killer app for video game consoles. The pixelated enemy alien has become a pop culture icon, often representing video games as a whole. The game has spawned dozens of sequels and remakes, been the inspiration for numerous pieces of art and music, been parodied across media, and been the focus of several pieces of legislation to limit access to video games.\nGameplay.\n\"Space Invaders\" is a fixed shooter in which the player moves a laser cannon, referred to as a \"Laser Base\", horizontally across the bottom of the screen and fires at a group of the titular alien invaders overhead. The invaders begin as five rows of eleven\u2014the amount differs in some versions\u2014that move left and right as a group, advancing on the shooter by shifting downward each time they reach a screen edge. The goal is to eliminate all the invaders by shooting them. Regardless of how many game lives remaining the player has, the game ends if the aliens reach the bottom of the screen.\nThe aliens attempt to destroy the player's cannon by firing projectiles. The laser cannon is partially protected by stationary defense bunkers that are gradually destroyed from above by the invaders; the bottom will be destroyed if the player fires when beneath one. As the invaders are defeated, their movement, as well as the accompanying music, speeds up. Defeating all the aliens brings another wave that starts lower, a loop that can continue endlessly. A special \"mystery ship\" will occasionally move across the top of the screen and award bonus points if destroyed.\nDevelopment.\n\"Space Invaders\" was developed by Japanese designer Tomohiro Nishikado, who spent a year designing it and developing the necessary hardware to produce it. Because he worked alone and handmade many of the development tools, the process incurred minimal costs. Taito originally did not credit a designer as anonymity was a required part of Nishikado's contract with the company. The game was a response to Atari, Inc.'s 1976 arcade game \"Breakout\". Nishikado noted that \"Breakout\"-style games were very popular in Japan in 1977. He was a fan of the game and aimed to create something better. The developer wanted to adapt the same sense of achievement and tension from destroying targets one at a time, combining it with elements of target shooting games. The game uses a similar layout to that of \"Breakout\" but with different game mechanics; rather than bounce a ball to attack static objects, players are given the ability to fire projectiles at moving enemies.\nTo improve the design, Nishikado felt the targets should have an interesting shape. Early enemy designs included tanks, combat planes, and battleships. Nishikado was not satisfied with the enemy movements; technical limitations made it difficult to animate flying. The designer believed animating human characters would have been easier to program, but he considered shooting them immoral. Nishikado also said that shooting people was frowned upon. After seeing the release of the 1974 anime \"Space Battleship Yamato\" in Japan, and seeing a magazine feature about the 1977 \"Star Wars\", he thought of using a space theme. Nishikado drew inspiration for the aliens from the novel \"The War of the Worlds\" and created initial bitmap images after the octopus-like aliens. Other alien designs were modeled after squids and crabs. After creating the pixel art, Nishikado created a tool to animate two frames of movement for each character and adjusted the design on-screen with a light pen. He added the bunkers and the mystery ship to the playing field afterward.\nNishikado added several interactive elements that he found lacking in earlier video games, such as enemies reacting to the player's movement and returning fire, and a game over triggered by the enemies killing the player character rather than simply a timer running out. He replaced the timer, typical of arcade games at the time, with descending aliens who effectively served a similar function, where the closer they came, the less time remained for the player. During the process, Nishikado wanted the game's difficulty to increase the longer the game progressed; he reasoned this kept the gameplay fresh and that the game would earn less if players could play for extended periods. He relied on feedback from his coworkers to balance the difficulty; in retrospect, Nishikado stated that without their input he would have made the game less challenging because he struggled to play it. The game was originally titled \"Space Monsters\" after a popular song in Japan at the time, \"\", but was changed to \"Space Invaders\" by the designer's superiors.\nHardware.\nNishikado designed his own custom hardware and development tools for \"Space Invaders\". The game uses an Intel 8080 central processing unit (CPU) and displays raster graphics on a CRT monitor using a bitmapped framebuffer. The game outputs monaural sound hosted by a combination of analog circuitry and a Texas Instruments SN76477 sound chip. The adoption of a microprocessor was inspired by the 1975 arcade game \"Gun Fight\", Midway's microprocessor adaptation of Nishikado's earlier discrete logic game \"Western Gun\", after the designer was impressed by the improved graphics and smoother animation of Midway's version. At the time, Taito had licensed Midway's technology to use in its games. Nishikado used Midway's arcade board as a motherboard and created additional boards and circuitry to expand the capabilities. \nAs microprocessors were manufactured in the United States, Nishikado had to rely on his English skills, which he described as limited, to translate the reference material. He dedicated about six months to studying American games and mastering using a microcomputer. While planning the game, Nishikado made iterative improvements to the hardware. He attributes his previous experience working with integrated circuits and learning assembly language during his university studies with helping him learn how to interact with the new hardware.\nTo add audio, Nishikado worked with Michiyuki Kamei, who created sound effects for Taito's games. Kamei spent four to five months on the audio circuitry for \"Space Invaders\" while also working on another game, \"Blue Shark\". As management had prioritized \"Blue Shark\", his work on \"Space Invaders\" was hurried in order to have both games ready for an unveiling event in the summer of 1978. Kamei decided to reuse parts and designs from other Taito games to meet the deadline. He replaced resistors and capacitors to adjust the pitch and duration of sound effects he created for \"Blue Shark\". To create the invaders' moving sound effect, Kamei reused the 556 timer integrated circuit from \"Super Speed Race\". Kamei felt the first invader sound effects were too comical and changed it after seeing the monster on the cabinet artwork and receiving feedback from Nishikado. Aiming to emulate the \"Jaws\" shark theme, he added resistors to the circuit in order to lower the effect's pitch. Texas Instruments had recently provided Taito free samples of the SN76477 sound chip, which Kamei inspected. Despite the higher cost, he chose it to produce the mystery ship's sound effects because the smaller chip saved space on the board.\nDespite the specially developed hardware, Nishikado was unable to program the game as he wanted\u2014the Control Program board was not powerful enough to display the graphics in color or move the enemies faster\u2014and considered the development of the hardware the most difficult part of the process. While programming, Nishikado discovered that the processor was able to render each frame of the alien's animation graphics faster when there were fewer aliens on the screen. Since the alien's positions updated after each frame, this caused the aliens to move across the screen at an increasing speed as more were destroyed; the accompanying audio sped up as well. Rather than design a compensation for the speed increase, he decided to keep this undocumented feature as a gameplay mechanism. In retrospect, Nishikado noted that this aspect made the game more interesting and compensated for the hardware's limitations.\nThe cabinet artwork features large humanoid monsters absent from the game, which Nishikado attributed to the artist basing the designs on the original \"Space Monsters\" title rather than referring to the in-game graphics. In the upright cabinets, the graphics are generated on a hidden CRT monitor and reflected toward the player using a semi-transparent mirror, behind which is mounted a plastic cutout of a moon bolted against a painted starry background. The backdrop is visible through the mirror and thus appears \"behind\" the graphics. Both Taito's and Midway's first \"Space Invaders\" releases have black-and-white graphics with strips of transparent orange and green cellophane over certain portions of the screen to add color to the image. Later Japanese releases feature a rainbow-colored cellophane overlay; later versions had a color monitor and an electronically generated color overlay.\nRelease.\nTaito first published \"Space Invaders\" on April 19, 1978. The company unveiled the game to businesses in June 1978. The focus of the event was \"Blue Shark\", which Taito management believed would be more successful, and \"Space Invaders\" was included later during the event planning. By July 1978, the company began mass-producing the game. Taito first released an upright arcade cabinet, which it announced in August 1978. The next month, the company released a cocktail-table cabinet version, which was named \"T.T. Space Invaders\" in Japan to indicate it was a \"table-top\" version. Taito then submitted a trademark request for the game's name with the Japan Patent Office on September 18, 1978. \nSoon after release, the developers became aware of a bug with the coin mechanism. Since only a few hundred units had been released at the time, Taito was able to apply a fix by replacing the machines' read-only memory (ROM). Taito also received requests to repair the game's audio, which Kamei discovered resulted from the loudspeaker's paper diaphragm breaking from usage. The company replaced the diaphragms in existing machines with a more durable version and included the upgrade in future arcade cabinets. A gameplay bug was discovered that prevented the invaders' attacks from harming the laser cannon at very close range. Although a programming fix was possible, Taito's management decided against a second ROM replacement; by then, the game's wide-spread popularity made it cost prohibitive. Players eventually adopted the bug as a strategy and named it \"Nagoya shooting\" and \"Wall of Death\". \nThe company had installed over 100,000 machines in Japan by the end of the year. To cope with the demand, Taito licensed the overseas rights to Midway for distribution outside of Japan near the end of 1978. Midway released upright and cocktail versions. By December 1978, Taito had to import Midway cabinets into Japan to meet the country's demand. It added Japanese instruction cards to the cabinets and referred to them as \"Space Invaders M\". The company also released a color version of \"T.T. Space Invaders\" that same month. Success prompted Taito to invest in manufacturing and expand globally, leading the company to found a subsidiary, Taito America, in the United States in 1979. Taito then filed a trademark request for its arcade game with the United States Patent and Trademark Office on December 10, 1979. The company produced 200,000\u2013300,000 units for the Japanese market by June 1979 and increased production to 25,000\u201330,000 units per month with Taito projecting to manufacture 400,000 machines in Japan by the end of 1979. By the end of 1979, an estimated 750,000 \"Space Invaders\" machines were installed worldwide, including 400,000 in Japan and 85,000 in the United Kingdom. Within a year of releasing in the United States, 60,000 units were in the country; the number of units in the United States eventually reached 72,000 by 1982. Nishikado wanted to design newer hardware to stay competitive, but the widespread demand led Taito to support the existing \"Space Invaders\" hardware by creating new games compatible with it. This provided other companies time to develop technology that could match Taito's. \"Space Invaders\" cabinets have since become collector's items, with the cocktail and cabaret versions the rarest. At the end of 2003, Taito announced plans to produce 10,000 \"Space Invaders\" cabinets to sell again for the game's 25th anniversary.\nThe 1980 port to the Atari 2600 was the first official licensing of an arcade game for consoles and became the first killer app for home video game consoles after quadrupling the system's sales. Other official home releases include a 1980 conversion for Atari 8-bit computers and a 1982 release for the Atari 5200 console. Taito released its own version for the Nintendo Famicom in 1985 exclusively in Japan. By 1982, versions of \"Space Invaders\" were available for handheld electronic game devices, tabletop dedicated consoles, home computers, watches and pocket calculators.\nMore than a hundred \"Space Invaders\" video game clones were released for various platforms. At the time, software and video games were not formally recognized as copyrighted works under Japanese copyright law. After the company won a case involving a sequel (\"Space Invaders Part II\") in the Tokyo District Court in December 1982, Taito could pursue legal action against unauthorized reproductions. Clone examples include the 1979 \"Super Invader\" for Apple computers, Epoch Co.'s 1980 \"TV Vader\" dedicated home console, and the 1981 \"TI Invaders\" for the TI-99/4A computer; the latter became the top-selling game for its platform by the end of 1982. Prior to its industry dominance, Nintendo's foray into arcade games consisted of clones of existing popular games, including the 1979 \"Space Invader\" clone \"Space Fever\". The influx of clones led to the term \"Invader game\" to identify the generic classification of games. Unofficial copies dominated the video game market in South Korea, and the market demand for the machine's hardware spurred the early growth of Korea's semiconductor industry.\nReception.\n\"Space Invaders\" initially received mixed responses from within Taito and little interest from Japanese amusement arcade owners. Nishikado's colleagues praised it, applauding his achievement while queuing up to play, whereas his bosses predicted low sales as games often ended more quickly than timer-based arcade games. While amusement arcade owners initially rejected it, pachinko parlors and bowling alleys adopted the game; \"Space Invaders\" caught on in those businesses, with many parlors and alleys installing additional cabinets. Within months, the game became so popular that specialty video arcades, referred to as \"\"Space Invaders\" Parlours\" and \"\"Space Invaders\" Houses\", opened with nothing but \"Space Invaders\" cabinets.\nA year after its release, \"Space Invaders\" became the arcade game industry's all-time best-seller. It remained the top arcade game for three years through 1980. By the end of 1978, the game had grossed Taito US$ (equivalent to $ in 2024) in Japan alone. By June 1979, each arcade machine was earning an average of $ per day. \"Space Invaders\"' popularity propelled it to become the first game that recouped a United States arcade machine's owner within a month of purchasing; prices ranged from $2,000 to $3,000 per machine in 1982. It had grossed more than $ by 1979 (equivalent to $ in 2024). In 1981, the game earned $ weekly in arcades in the United States, second only to \"Pac-Man\". The Arcade Awards ceremony was created that same year to honor the best video games, with \"Space Invaders\" winning the first Best Coin-Op Electronic Game award. By 1982, it had grossed $2\u00a0billion (equivalent to $ in 2024), with a net profit of $450\u00a0million (equivalent to $ in 2024). This made it the best-selling video game and highest-grossing \"entertainment product\" of its time, with comparisons made to the then highest-grossing film \"Star Wars\", which had grossed $486\u00a0million, with a net profit of $175\u00a0million in the early 1980s. By 1982, it had grossed $, equivalent to over $ as of 2016. \"Space Invaders\" earned Taito profits of over $500 million by 2008 (equivalent to $ million in 2024).\nPorts have received mixed reviews; the Atari 2600 version was successful, while the Famicom version was poorly received. After selling over 1.0 million units its first year, the Atari 2600 port sold over 4.2 million copies by the end of 1981, becoming the best-selling Atari 2600 game until the 1982 Atari version of \"Pac-Man\" released. By 1983, the Atari 2600 version had sold almost 6.1 million cartridges. Bill Kunkel and Frank Laney in \"Video\" magazine found the variants on the arcade game interesting but suggested that purists will probably focus on the original version of the game included. Media writer Howard J. Blumenthal suggested that it requires skilled agility and hand-eye coordination and concluded that it was \"a highly competitive reaction game, and one of the best available.\" \"Electronic Games\" magazine writers rated the game a perfect ten overall, noting high rankings for single-player gameplay, while only finding the game's graphics and sound to be merely good. The writers also reviewed the port for Atari's 8-bit home computers, complimenting the game for its excelling gameplay while finding its graphics and sound and enjoyment as a one-player game to be merely \"good\". Conversely, an editor for the \"Personal Computers &amp; Games\" book found this version to be unfaithful to the original game, recommending Roklan's \"Deluxe Invaders\" for an experience more attuned to Taito's arcade game.\nRetrospective.\nThe game has received a positive retrospective reception decades after its release. In rating the arcade release a perfect five stars, Brett Alan Weiss of \"Allgame\" noted \"Space Invaders\"' groundbreaking features and quick success in the United States. While he pointed out the arcade version's simple graphics and level of engagement haven't aged well, Spanner Spencer of \"Eurogamer\" lauded the game's historical impact. He further described \"Space Invaders\" as the epitome of fundamental gameplay with \"no frills\" that retro game enthusiasts seek. \nPorts of the original received generally positive reviews from video game publications. Weiss rated two of the console ports favorably but slightly lower than the arcade. Comparing it to the Atari 2600 version, Weiss complemented the gameplay of the Atari 5200 release, commenting that the different gameplay is a welcome change from the arcade game, but questioned why both Atari console versions were so similar. Writing for \"Entertainment Weekly\", Aaron Morales ranked it the third top game for the Atari 2600 in 2013, citing how it demonstrated that good ports were possible on the console. Reviewing the Super Nintendo Entertainment System release, Weiss praised the quality of the graphic's reproduction as well as how enjoyable the different modes are to play. Conversely, he noted how simplistic the visual are by contemporary standards and commented that players unfamiliar with older games would find it \"archaic\". \"Games World\" magazine's four reviewers\u2014Dave Perry, Nick Walkland, Nick Roberts, and Adrian Price\u2014praised the release for the Game Boy handheld console. While several noted the nostalgia as a major selling point, they also said that the basic gameplay was dated. Perry and Roberts drew attention to its improved graphics when played on the Super Game Boy, which they considered the best way to play it. Writing for \"Polygon\" in 2019, Jeremy Parish ranked this version the 21st greatest title on the handheld system. \nNumerous publications have ranked \"Space Invaders\" among the most important video games. Editors from \"Flux\" and \"Next Generation\" magazines listed it on their respective lists of top video games in 1995 and 1996. \"Flux\" magazine staff ranked \"Space Invaders\" the top game and lauded the scenario for deviating from the contemporary trend of reality-based simulations. They noted that while most games are classics for being either revolutionary or pure, \"Space Invaders\" was both. In placing the game at number 97, \"Next Generation\" editors wrote that it \"provides an elegance and simplicity not found in later games.\" Over a decade later, \"Guinness World Records\" considered \"Space Invaders\" the top-rated arcade game in terms of technical, creative, and cultural impact as well as one of the most successful arcade shooting games. In 2021, Keith Stuart of \"The Guardian\" listed it as the third-greatest video game of the 1970s. \nSeveral publications have regarded \"Space Invaders\" as an influential game. Ryan Geddes and Daemon Hatfield of \"IGN\" listed it as one of the \"Top 10 Most Influential Games\" in 2007, citing it as a source of inspiration to video game designers and the impact it had on the shooting genre. Writing for \"The Times Online\", Michael Moran ranked it the \"most influential video game ever\" in 2007, citing its \"immensely addictive\" gameplay and explosive effect on the industry's growth. In describing it as a \"seminal arcade classic\", \"IGN\"'s Levi Buchanan listed the game as the number eight \"classic shoot 'em up\" that same year. \"1UP.com\"'s Rowan Kaiser ranked it the third \"Most Influential Game of All Time\" in 2011, calling \"Space Invaders\" \"the first video game as a video game, instead of merely a playable electronic representation of something else\" like earlier arcade games. \"Space Invaders\" was inducted into the World Video Game Hall of Fame in 2016. Nishikado noted that he had little attachment to the game for twenty years following its release. He previously considered an earlier game, the 1974 \"Speed Race\", his favorite project over \"Space Invaders\". After learning how much the game is still played and appreciated decades later, he changed his opinion in the 2010s, recognizing \"Space Invaders\" as his best work.\nLegacy.\nRemakes and sequels.\n\"Space Invaders\" has been remade on numerous platforms and spawned many sequels. Re-releases include ported and updated versions of the original arcade game, some of which feature different graphics and additional gameplay options. Sequels feature several modes of gameplay and integrate new elements into the original design. Bally released a pinball version in 1980 with no elements of the arcade game present and the aliens resembling the xenomorphs from the film \"Alien\"; Bally was successfully sued over the resemblance to H. R. Giger's designs. It became the third highest-grossing pinball machine of 1980 in the United States. Super Impulse released a miniature version in 2017 as part of its \"Tiny Arcade\" series. Numskull Designs created another miniature arcade cabinet in 2023, released in the company's Quarter Arcades line.\nTaito has released several arcade sequels. The first was \"Space Invaders Part II\" in 1979 featuring color graphics, an attract mode, new gameplay elements, and added an intermission between gameplay. This was released in the United States as \"Deluxe Space Invaders\" (also known as \"Space Invaders Deluxe\"), but featured a different graphical color scheme and a lunar-city background. Another arcade sequel, \"Space Invaders II\", was released exclusively in the United States. It was in a cocktail-table format with very fast alien firing and a competitive two-player mode. During the summer of 1985, \"Return of the Invaders\" was released with updated color graphics and more complex movements and attack patterns for the aliens. Subsequent arcade sequels included \"Super Space Invaders '91\", \"Space Invaders DX\", and \"Space Invaders '95\", each introducing minor gameplay additions to the original design. Several of the arcade sequels have become collector's items, though some are considered rarer. In 2002, Taito released \"Space Raiders\", a third-person shooter reminiscent of \"Space Invaders\". \"Space Invaders Extreme\", released on the Nintendo DS and PlayStation Portable in 2008, integrates musical elements into the standard gameplay. A 2008 spin-off for WiiWare, \"Space Invaders Get Even\", allows players to control the aliens instead of the laser cannon in a reversal of roles. Later arcade releases include \"Space Invaders Frenzy\" in 2017 and \"Space Invaders Counter Attack\" in 2020. Both games feature two-player electro-mechanical gameplay with a large amount of invaders.\n\"Space Invaders\" and its related games have been included in video game compilations. \"Space Invaders Anniversary\" was released in 2003 for the PlayStation 2 and included nine \"Space Invader\" variants. A similar game for the PlayStation Portable, \"Space Invaders Pocket\", was released in 2005. \"Space Invaders\", \"Space Invaders Part II\" and \"Return of the Invaders\" are included in \"Taito Legends\", a compilation of Taito's classic arcade games released in 2005 on the PlayStation 2, Xbox, and PC. \"Super Space Invaders '91\", \"Space Invaders DX\", and \"Space Invaders '95\" were included in \"Taito Legends 2\", a sequel compilation released in 2006. In 2025, Blaze Entertainment announced it would release a Taito-themed Alpha bartop arcade and a Taito cartridge for the Evercade handheld game console, both which include \"Space Invaders\" among other classic Taito games.\nIndustry impact.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n\"\"Space Invaders\" and games like it represent the roots of everything we see today in gaming. It represents the birth of a new art form, one that literally changed the world. \"Space Invaders\" is important as an historical artifact, no less than the silent films of the early twentieth century or early printed books.\"\n Video game developer Warren Spector on \"Space Invaders\"' industry impact\nFigures in the video game industry have highlighted \"Space Invaders\"'s milestones and the impact they have had. Shigeru Miyamoto, the longtime general manager of Nintendo Entertainment Analysis &amp; Development, considers \"Space Invaders\" the video game industry's most revolutionary title. Video game historian Alexander Smith described Nishikado's design of \"allowing targets to attack the player\" without a timer as \"a new paradigm in video games.\" Developer Eugene Jarvis noted that many games \"still rely on the multiple life, progressively difficult level paradigm\" of Space Invaders and that the game's characters, story, and action \"laid the groundwork for a whole generation\" of video games. Parish credits \"Space Invaders\" as the first to capitalize on quirky characters, noting that the alien characters' \"charm\" and \"rudimentary sense of personality\" helped video games break away from a \"realistic simulation\" design style\u2014previous games were predominantly inspired by sports and racing. Video game journalists Brian Ashcraft and Jean Snow attribute the introduction of multiple video game lives to \"Space Invaders\". While several publications have credited the game for introducing the concept of saving high scores, \"Guinness World Records\" recognizes the 1976 arcade game \"Sea Wolf\" as the first to implement the feature. \nTechnology journalist Jason Whittaker noted that \"Space Invaders\" helped action games become the dominant genre in arcades and on consoles, and he attributes the popularity of shoot 'em ups to the game's simple gameplay rules. \"Electronic Games\" writers observed an increase of science fiction and space-themed games following \"Space Invaders\"' release. They noted that many built upon its gameplay through iterative changes, like \"Galaxian\" and derivatives with a similar style, while others drew inspiration from \"Space Invaders\" but took the design in new directions, such as Atari's \"Asteroids\" and Activision's \"Laser Blast\". Scott Osborne of \"GameSpy\" noted the derivative design of Namco's 1979 \"Galaxian\" and 1981 \"Galaga\" games but acknowledged that their innovative changes and refinements made the games very successful in their own right. The game's influence extended to the development of Williams Electronics's first game, the 1981 \"Defender\"; early versions drew heavily from \"Space Invaders\" before its developer, Jarvis, took it a different direction. Outside shooting games, Sega/Gremlin's 1979 \"Head On\" adopted the concept of \"going round after round\" in lieu of a timer after a senior developer from its parent company, Sega, had seen \"Space Invaders\". The game's designer, Lane Hauck, credits this change to \"Head On\"'s success. \nShooting games.\nMcCarthy considered \"Space Invaders\" an early game that shaped the wider shooter genre. In listing it as one of the ten most influential games, Geddes and Hatfield credited \"Space Invaders\" for introducing design elements that became common place in the industry. The two attributed the popularity of shooting-endless-waves-of-enemies gameplay to the creation of the shoot 'em up subgenre, citing titles like \"Galaga\", \"Centipede\", and \"Ikaruga\" as its lineage. Kevin Bowen of \"GameSpy\" noted that numerous titles, like \"Galaga\" and \"Gradius\", have been influenced by the gameplay established by \"Space Invaders\". Edwards also credited it for spawning the shoot 'em up subgenre, which was very prominent in Japan during the 1980s and early 1990s. He noted that though there were several notable shooting games before it, \"Space Invaders\" \"put it all together\" in way unseen before. \"Gamest\" magazine staff also considered it the beginning of the shooting game genre, outlining the evolution of titles from fixed shooters, like \"Space Invaders\" and \"Galaga\", to scrolling shooters, like \"Scramble\" and the \"Gradius\" series.\nWriting for \"GameSetWatch\" in 2010, Simon Carless noted a similar influence on contemporary first-person shooters like \"\", commenting that it and \"Space Invaders\" share core principles: take cover behind walls and shoot enemies to obtain a high score. Ashcraft credits the game with the origin of the cover system of gameplay, as well as the use of destructible barriers. Video game journalist Craig Granell noted that since its introduction in \"Space Invaders\", the destructible shields concept has become a common-place element in games. In observing the lineage between \"Space Invaders\" and \"Wolfenstein 3D\", English professor Ronald Strickland commented that the two, as well as all previous first-person shooting games, were grounded on the same theme of \"kill or be killed\". Interactive media professor Frans M\u00e4yr\u00e4 made a similar comparison to \"Doom\", commenting that both present a clear challenge to survive by \"shooting everything that moves.\" Nishikado attributed the game's popularity among younger players to these elements, commenting that the more interactive attacks from enemies, coupled with the requirement to defeat them all, made the gameplay more thrilling.\nVideo game audio.\nMusic scholar Andrew Schartmann wrote that the fundamental audio techniques \"Space Invaders\" introduced shaped the industry and that the game's immense popularity facilitated a widespread adoption of those techniques. Prior to \"Space Invaders\", music typically played during introductions or closings. Its looped music plays during gameplay while the game's interactions generate sound effects, which together Schartmann described as a \"rich sonic landscape\". He further noted that while the four-note loop seemed \"pedestrian\", its ability to stir a reaction from players moved video games closer to an art form. The title's changing tempo popularized variability in game music; developers later applied the strategy to pitch, rhythm, form, and other parameters to accommodate nonlinear aspects of games. Karen Collins, a professor of interactive media, echoed similar statements, noting that the combination of introducing continuous background music and dynamically changing the pace during gameplay was itself a worthy milestone. \n\"Next Generation\" editor Neil West cited \"Space Invaders\"'s music as an example of great video game art, commenting on how the simple melody's increasing tempo and synchronization with the enemies' movement chills and excites the player. Tommy Tallarico, a video game composer and sound designer, cited \"Space Invaders\" as an example of how video game music is \"not a passive linear medium\", stating that the interaction elevates the experience to a higher level for the senses. He echoed West's assessment, commenting that the simple beats increased the player's heart rate\u2014instilling a sense of panic\u2014as the invaders approached the bottom of the screen. In describing the audio's increasing pace, video game journalist and historian Bill Loguidice likened the background music to the sound of a heartbeat. He noted that the effect carried forward into other games; for example, \"Dungeons of Daggorath\" features a similar heartbeat sound to indicate player health. Writing for \"GameSpot\", Glenn McDonald made similar observations about the effect the game's audio and noted a similar technique used in \"Asteroids\".\nGrowth of industry.\n\"Space Invaders\"'s success is considered a watershed moment for the Japanese video game industry. Parish called \"Space Invaders\" Japan's first \"hit game\". Whittaker remarked that the game was the start of Japanese developers obtaining market success, a trend that culminated in the country's dominance of the industry in mid-1980s. Martin Picard, a scholar of Japanese culture, called the game's release the turning point for the Japanese video game industry, which led to the global spread of the country's gaming creativity.\nNumerous publications pointed to the game's success as a catalyst for the video game industry's growth. \"Electronic Games\"'s editors called \"Space Invaders\" the impetus behind video gaming becoming a rapidly growing hobby in 1981 and \"the single most popular coin-operated attraction of all time.\" \"Edge\" staff ascribed the shift of games from bars and amusement arcades to more mainstream locations, such as restaurants and department stores, to \"Space Invaders\"; by the end of the 1970s, arcade games began appearing in hotel lobbies, airports, and convenience stores. Writing for \"IGN\", Levi Buchanan attributed the launch of the \"arcade phenomenon\" in North America in part to the title. Whittaker credited \"Space Invaders\" with ending the video game crash of 1977 and ushering in the golden age of video arcade games. Staff for \"Game Informer\" magazine considered it, along with \"Pac-Man\", one of the most popular arcade games for tapping into popular culture and generating excitement during the golden age of arcades. Benj Edwards of \"1UP.com\" wrote that \"Space Invaders\" demonstrated video games could compete against the major entertainment media at the time: films, music, and television.\nIn 1980, Atari sponsored a nation-wide \"Space Invaders\" tournament in the United States. Media coverage of the tournament helped establish video gaming as a mainstream hobby. Video game journalist David McCarthy noted that players continued competing to achieve the highest score for \"Space Invaders\" decades after its release. Twin Galaxies, who officiated and tracked competitive high scores for players, recorded high scores for the arcade version and some of its handheld ports into the 2000s. \nSeveral game developers cited \"Space Invaders\" as their introduction to video games. Miyamoto\u2014the creator of \"Donkey Kong\", \"Mario\", and \"The Legend of Zelda\"\u2014commented that the game incited his interest in video games, leading him to pursue it as a profession. During his time in junior high school, \"Pok\u00e9mon\" creator Satoshi Tajiri felt inspired to make a \"Space Invaders\" sequel after playing it. Hideo Kojima, creator of \"Metal Gear\", cites \"Space Invaders\" as the first game that \"pulled him in\". Jarvis began his career at Williams Electronics developing pinball games but pursued arcade games after seeing \"Space Invaders\"'s gameplay, leading him to work on \"Defender\". He described the industry scene at the time as an \"incredible universe now open to video game designers\", citing the hype of \"Space Invaders\" and other popular space games released around 1979. The creators of \"Doom\", John Romero and John Carmack, have named it as their introduction to video games. Romero commented that he thought games like \"Space Invaders\" and \"Targ\" opened up creative possibilities because they were not limited by physical materials like pinball and electromagnetic games. Andrew and Philip Oliver, the creators of the \"Dizzy\" series, ascribed their initial desire for video games to \"Space Invaders\". Writing for \"The Observer\", Giles Richards attributed the popularity of the game's home console versions to encouraging users to learn programming, many of which later becoming industry leaders.\nIn media.\nMusicians have drawn inspiration for their music from \"Space Invaders\". Soon after the game's arcade release, the Japanese synthpop group Yellow Magic Orchestra reproduced \"Space Invaders\" sounds in its 1978 self-titled album and hit single \"Computer Game\"; the latter sold over 400,000 copies in the United States. The next year, the band Funny Stuff released \"Disco Space Invaders\" in Japan and songwriters Russell Dunlop and Bruce Brown released \"Space Invaders\" in Australia as the group Player One. The trend continued in 1980 with two more songs titled \"Space Invaders\"; one on The Pretenders' self-titled album and another by WGCL disc jockey Victor Blecman.\nDecades later, Video Games Live performed audio from \"Space Invaders\" as part of a special retro \"Classic Arcade Medley\" in 2007. In honor of the game's 30th anniversary, Taito produced an album titled \"Space Invaders 2008\" that features music inspired by the game. Released by Avex Trax in December 2008, the album includes six songs that were originally in the PSP version of \"Space Invaders Extreme\". Taito produced a \"Space Invaders\"-themed animated music video to promote the album. Initially showcased only in its chain of stores (Taito Station) starting in April 2008, the company later released the video on DVD in October 2008.\nMultiple television series have aired episodes that either reference or parody \"Space Invaders\", such as \"Danger Mouse\", \"That '70s Show\", \"Scrubs\", \"Chuck\", \"Robot Chicken\", \"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles\" and \"The Amazing World of Gumball\". Elements are prominently featured in the \"Raiders of the Lost Arcade\" segment of \"Anthology of Interest\u00a0II\", an episode of \"Futurama\". The \"Space Invaders\" aliens appear in the French online short film \"Pixels\", which Happy Madison Productions adapted into a feature film by the same name in 2015.\nIn 2010, Warner Bros. Pictures approached Taito for the film rights to the video game, with Mark Gordon, Jason Blum, and Guymon Casady attached as producers. By the time Warner Bros. acquired the rights in 2014, Akiva Goldsman was slated to produce. In February 2015, Daniel Kunka was set to write the script for the production company, Safehouse Pictures. The project stalled until July 2019, when Warner Bros.'s subsidiary, New Line Cinema, announced that Greg Russo would write the script. Goldsman remained the producer alongside Safehouse Pictures partners Joby Harold and Tory Tunnell. Taito filed the name \"Space Invaders\" for film production with the United States Patent and Trademark Office on July 07, 2021. Years later, Safehouse Pictures brought in Ben Zazove and Evan Turner in August 2025 to write a new script.\n\"Space Invaders\" has been the subject of several books, such as the 1980 \"Space Invaders\" by Mark Roeder and Julian Wolanski, the 1982 \"Invasion of the Space Invaders\" by Martin Amis, and the 2006 \"Tomb Raiders and Space Invaders\" by Geoff King and Tanya Krzywinska. It has been recreated in other video games. Players have used the gameplay mechanics in the sandbox games \"Minecraft\" and \"Astroneer\" to reproduce \"Space Invaders\". Epic Games included a hidden game in \"Fortnite\" that features gameplay similar to \"Space Invaders\". In 2020, Taito made the error page of its website an interactive version of \"Space Invaders\".\nCultural impact.\nWriting for \"The New York Times\", Jeremy Horwitz compared \"Space Invaders\"'s impact on the video game industry to that of The Beatles in the pop music industry. Video game journalist Chris Kohler considers \"Space Invaders\" \"the first 'blockbuster' video game\", stating that it became synonymous with video games worldwide for some time. Many publications and websites use the pixelated alien graphic as an icon for video games in general, including the video game magazine \"Electronic Gaming Monthly\", technology website \"Ars Technica\", and concert event Video Games Live. Brazilian zoologists Adriano Kury and Carla Barros named a new species of arachnid \"Taito spaceinvaders\" in 2014 due to the resemblance of the species' fleck on its dorsal scutum to a \"Space Invaders\" alien. The invader character was adapted into the \"alien monster\" emoji in version 10 of the Unicode standard in 2017.\nThe game has permeated numerous cultural aspects of society. In 1981, \"\"Space Invaders\" Wrist\" was documented as an ailment in \"The New England Journal of Medicine\". Technology author and lecturer Tom Forester noted that North American doctors had identified a condition called \"\"Space Invaders\" elbow\" as a complaint in the 1980s. The game became the center of an urban legend that its popularity led to a shortage of 100-yen coins in Japan, but reports from those living in Japan at the time indicate \"nothing out of the ordinary\" around \"Space Invaders\"'s release and Nishikado expressed skepticism. Numismatist Mark Fox noted that arcade operators would have regularly emptied their machines, keeping the currency in circulation and attributed the myth to lower 100-yen coin productions in 1978 and 1979. Highways England launched a safety campaign in 2018 titled \"Don't be a Space Invader, Stay Safe, Stay Back\"\u2014featuring the game's logo and alien character\u2014to raise awareness on the dangers of tailgating. \nSeveral politicians have lobbied to restrict children from accessing the game. In the United Kingdom, George Foulkes proposed a Private Member's Bill in 1981 titled \"Control of Space Invaders and other Electronic Games Bill\" to allow local councils to restrict it and similar games via licensing for its \"addictive properties\" and for causing \"deviancy\". The bill was never considered by Parliament, as a motion to bring it up was defeated 114 votes to 94 votes. \"Guinness World Records\" recognized this as the \"First arcade videogame debated in Parliament\". In 1981, the Irvington, New York board of trustees proposed a resolution to place age restrictions on \"Space Invaders\" and other arcade games as well as limit the quantity in businesses. A similar restriction occurred in Mesquite, Texas, resulting in a court case that was appealed to the Supreme Court of the United States, who ruled the city ordinance unconstitutional in 1982. \n\"Space Invaders\" has been the subject and inspiration for multiple pieces of art and endeavors. As part of the Japan Media Arts Festival's 10th anniversary in 2006, \"Space Invaders\" was one of several video game-related media selected to represent Japanese entertainment; the media were on display at a special exhibit at The National Art Center in Tokyo. The project selections were compiled by Japan's Agency for Cultural Affairs via a mix of polling from the general public and industry professionals. That same year, \"Space Invaders\" was included in the London Science Museum's Game On exhibition, meant to showcase aspects of video game history, development, and culture, and included in the Barbican Centre's traveling exhibition. At the Belluard Bollwerk International 2006 festival in Fribourg, Switzerland, Guillaume Reymond made a three-minute stop motion video recreation of a game of \"Space Invaders\" as part of the \"Gameover\" project using people sitting in auditorium seats as pixels. The GH ART exhibit at the 2008 Games Convention in Leipzig, Germany, included an art game named \"Invaders!\", which featured \"Space Invaders\"'s gameplay with references to the September 11 attacks in the United States. The game attracted criticism online and a response from Taito stating that it was \"considering all available options \u2013 including legal actions.\" In response, the creator asked for \"Invaders!\" to be removed from the exhibit. A bridge in C\u00e1ceres, Spain, projected by engineers Pedro Plasencia and Hadri\u00e1n Arias, features a pavement design based on \"Space Invaders\", with the laser cannon, shots, and several figures visible on the deck. Anonymous French street artist Invader has created mosaic artwork of \"Space Invader\" aliens around the world, including the International Space Station and European Space Agency installations.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He was the son of W. A. Hewitt, and the father of Bill Hewitt.\nEarly life and early career.\nBorn in Toronto, Ontario, Hewitt attended Upper Canada College and the University of Toronto where he was a member of the Toronto chapter of the Beta Theta Pi fraternity. He was a champion boxer in his student years, winning the intercollegiate title at 112 pounds.\nHewitt developed an early interest in the radio and as a teenager accompanied his father, W. A. Hewitt, on a trip to Detroit, Michigan, to see a demonstration of radio technology sponsored by General Electric.\nHe took a job with Independent Telephone Company, which manufactured radios, and left that job and university when his father\u2014the sports editor of the \"Toronto Daily Star\"\u2014told him that the \"Star\" was going to start its own radio station. Hewitt became a reporter at the paper, and was ready to go on the air when CFCA was launched. CFCA's first hockey broadcast was on February 8, 1923, although it was colleague Norman Albert who performed the play-by-play. Hewitt's first broadcast likely was February 16, of a game between the Toronto Argonaut Rowing Club and the Kitchener Greenshirts. Hewitt recalled the date as being March 22 in his own book, although there was no game scheduled for that night at the Arena Gardens. Hewitt's book also mentioned his first broadcast as being of a game between Parkdale and Kitchener, and the Argonaut Club was based in Parkdale, a neighbourhood of Toronto. He also mentioned that game as going into overtime which the Argonaut-Kitchener game did.\nOn May 24, 1925, Hewitt and his father made what was said to be the world's first broadcast of a horse race.\nIn 1927, he was invited as guest announcer to broadcast the first game from the new Detroit Olympia.\nHewitt was part of the opening night ceremonies for Maple Leaf Gardens on November 12, 1931, and the specially designed broadcast \"gondola\" where Hewitt would broadcast from was brought into the plans with his input, and the blessings of then Toronto Maple Leafs owner Conn Smythe.\n\"Hockey Night in Canada\".\nFor forty years, Hewitt was Canada's premier hockey play-by-play broadcaster for the General Motors (Canada), then later Imperial Oil Limited, Hockey Broadcast on Saturday nights. As the show was aired on Canadian national radio, Hewitt became notable for the phrase \"He shoots, he scores!\" as well as his sign-on at the beginning of each broadcast, \"Hello, Canada, and hockey fans in the United States and Newfoundland.\"\n\"Hockey Night in Canada\" broadcasts from Toronto (aired on local station CFRB as well as successively CNR Radio, the Canadian Radio Broadcasting Commission, and ultimately CBC Radio) were simulcast on CBC Television from 1952 until 1963, with Hewitt handling the play-by-play until October 11, 1958, when he handed the duties over to his son, Bill Hewitt. In the process, he provided colour commentary of the Saturday night games after that, while continuing radio play-by-play of weeknight games. After 1963, Foster was solely on radio while Bill worked on television.\nIn 1951, he started his own radio station in Toronto, CKFH, initially at 1400 kHz, until moving to 1430 in 1959. The station carried Maple Leafs games until losing the rights in 1978. In 1981, the station was sold to Telemedia and was renamed CJCL. He made a bid at purchasing CHIN in 1970.\nLater life.\n Hewitt had retired from television in 1963, but he continued to broadcast Leafs games on radio until 1968. In 1965, he became one of a group of owners of the WHL Vancouver Canucks, a minor professional hockey team. The following year, he and co-owner Cyrus McLean made a presentation to the National Hockey League asking the league to award them an NHL franchise, but their bid was rejected.\nHewitt came out of retirement to broadcast the 1972 Summit Series (with colour commentator Brian Conacher). Hewitt was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame as a builder in 1965. In 1972, he was made an Officer of the Order of Canada. The Foster Hewitt Memorial Award from the Hockey Hall of Fame is named after him, as is the media gondola at the nearby Scotiabank Arena. Hewitt's original gondola from Maple Leaf Gardens was dismantled, then dumped into an incinerator in August 1979 to make room for private boxes, under the MLG leadership of Harold Ballard.\nFoster Hewitt was posthumously inducted into the Canadian Association of Broadcasters Hall of Fame in 1989 and the Ontario Sports Hall of Fame in 1996.\nPersonal life.\nHe and his wife Elizabeth Kathleen How had a son, Bill Hewitt, and a daughter, Elizabeth Ann Somerville. Hewitt died from a combination of Alzheimer's disease, kidney failure, and throat cancer on April 21, 1985, at the age of 82, at Providence Villa Nursing Home in Scarborough, Ontario.\nIn popular culture.\nA Canadian-style pub and grill restaurant was established in his name in Kaohsiung, Taiwan.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Dick\n\"Second Variety\" is a science fiction novelette by American writer Philip K. Dick, first published in \"Space Science Fiction\" magazine, in May 1953, with illustrations by Alex Ebel. Set in a world where a war between the Soviet Union and the United Nations has reduced most of the world to a barren wasteland, the story concerns the discovery, by the few remaining soldiers left, that self-replicating robots originally built to assassinate Soviet agents have gained sentience and are now plotting against both sides. It is one of many stories by Dick examining the implications of nuclear war, particularly after it has destroyed much or all of the planet.\nThe story was adapted into the film \"Screamers\" in 1995. The short story \"Jon's World\", written in 1954, serves as a sequel.\nPlot.\n\"Second Variety\" occurs in the aftermath of an extensive nuclear war between the Soviet Union (sometimes referred to as Russia) and the United Nations. Early Soviet victories forced the North American government and production to flee to a moonbase, leaving the majority of their troops behind. To counter the almost complete Soviet victory, UN technicians develop robots, nicknamed \"claws\"\u2014the basic models are \"a churning sphere of blades and metal\" that ambush their unsuspecting victims \"spinning, creeping, shaking themselves up suddenly from the gray ash and darting toward\u2026 [any warm body]\". UN forces are protected from the claws by a special radiation-emitting wrist tab. Within six years, the sophisticated and independent claws have destroyed the Soviet forces, repairing and redesigning themselves in underground automated factories run without any human oversight.\nThe UN forces receive a message from the Soviets asking for a policy-level officer to go to them for a gravely urgent conference. The UN victory was costlier than they had expected. Major Joseph Hendricks is sent to negotiate with the Soviets. En route to the rendezvous, he meets a small boy named David who asks to accompany Hendricks. When they near the Soviet bunker, soldiers immediately kill the boy, revealing him to be an android. The claws' development program has evolved to develop sophisticated robots, indistinguishable from humans, designed to infiltrate and kill. The three Soviets met by Major Hendricks\u2014soldiers Klaus, Rudi, and a young woman named Tasso\u2014reveal that the entire Soviet Army and command structure collapsed under the onslaught of the new robots\u2014they are all that are left in the command center.\nFrom salvaged internal metal identification plates, two varieties are identified: I-V, a wounded soldier, and III-V, David. II-V\u2014the \"second variety\"\u2014remains unknown. The different models are produced independently of each other in different factories. The Soviets also reveal that the UN protective tabs are ineffective against the new robots. Hendricks attempts to transmit a warning to his headquarters bunker, but is unable to do so.\nDuring the night, Klaus claims Rudi is the II-V and kills him, only for human organs to be revealed. The next morning, Hendricks and the two remaining Soviets return to the UN lines. When they reach the bunker, they discover it overrun: a crowd of David and Wounded Soldier robots attack, but Tasso destroys them with a very powerful hand grenade, stating that it was designed to destroy the robots. Hendricks and Tasso flee, leaving Klaus to the old-style claws. However, Klaus survives both the claws and the bomb blast only to be shot by Tasso, sending \"gears and wheels\" flying. Tasso tells Hendricks that Klaus must have been the II-V robot.\nHendricks, now suffering from a wounded arm and internal injuries, hopes to escape to the Moon Base. He and Tasso search for a hidden escape rocket, which is found to be a single-seat spacecraft. Hendricks attempts to leave, but Tasso convinces him to let her leave and send back help. In his injured state, he has no choice but to agree. Hendricks provides Tasso with the signal code needed to find the Moon Base.\nAlone and armed with Tasso's pistol, Hendricks returns to Klaus' remains and discovers from the parts that the robot was not a II-V, but a IV-V. A group of robots then attack Hendricks, including Davids, Wounded Soldiers, and several Tasso models\u2014the true II-V. Hendricks recognizes that he has doomed the Moon Base by sending a robot to them, and that he cannot withstand the onslaught of robots attacking him. Noticing the bombs carried by all the Tasso models, Hendricks' final thought is that the robots are already producing weapons designed for killing each other.\nReception.\n\"Strange Horizons\" called the story one of \"Dick's most compelling works\", and stated that it is \"often singled out as one of the early stories that most anticipates Dick's preoccupations in his more famous novels\".\nIn 2004, the story was a finalist for the 1954 Retro-Hugo Award for Best Novelette.\nPublication history.\n\"Second Variety\" was first published in the May 1953 issue of \"Space Science Fiction\" magazine. It has since been republished in the following collections:\nAdaptations.\nA Canadian film based on \"Second Variety\", titled \"Screamers\", was made in 1995, featuring Peter Weller. Produced after the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the film employs a new backstory involving a proxy war between disgruntled miners and mercenaries over working conditions on a hostile planet. Jason P. Vest, in \"Future Imperfect: Philip K. Dick at the Movies\", writes that the film is more faithful than most other adaptations, but it received a mixed critical reception and failed at the box office.\nSheldon Wilson directed a sequel titled \"\" in 2009.\nAn audio-drama miniseries based on \"Second Variety\" was made in 2020 as part of the \"Curious Matter Anthology\" podcast.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "74341", "revid": "50882027", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=74341", "title": "DuPont Manual High School", "text": "duPont Manual High School is a public magnet high school located in the Old Louisville neighborhood of Louisville, Kentucky, United States. It serves students in grades 9\u201312. It is a part of the Jefferson County Public School District. DuPont Manual is recognized by the United States Department of Education as a Blue Ribbon School.\nManual, funded by Mr. A. V. duPont, opened in 1892 s an all-male manual training school. It was the second public high school in Louisville. Manual merged with its rival, Male High School, into a consolidated school from 1915 to 1919. Manual permanently merged with the Louisville Girls High School in 1950 and moved into their Gothic-style three-story building, built in 1934. In 2004, after conducting a poll, Louisville's \"Courier-Journal\" newspaper listed Manual as one of Louisville residents' ten favorite buildings. Manual experienced a decline in discipline and test scores in the 1970s. In 1984, Manual became a magnet school, allowing students from throughout the district to apply to five specialized programs of study, or magnets.\nManual and Male High School have the oldest football rivalry in the state, dating back to 1893. Manual's football team has won five state titles and claims two national championships. In the 1980s and 1990s Manual became a prominent academic school and has been included several times in lists of America's top high schools in \"Redbook\" and \"Newsweek\" magazines. The high school has been recognized as a Perennial Top Academic School in Kentucky and holds the most national merit semi-finalists among all JCPS High Schools.\nHistory.\nduPont Manual Training High School.\nIn 1892, Louisville factory owner Alfred Victor du Pont donated $150,000 to the board of Louisville Public Schools to establish a training school to teach young men industrial arts (\"manual\") skills that would fit them for their duties in life. The Victorian building was built on the corner of Brook and Oak Streets by the firm of Clark and Loomis, which also designed the Speed Art Museum and Waverly Hills Sanatorium. After Manual moved out of the building it was used as a Middle School until 1974 when it was converted to apartments. Manual's first principal, Henry Kleinschmid, was a favorite of du Pont but was unpopular with the school board, which conspired to replace him in 1895. Despite a summer of controversy and protest from the du Pont family, Manual's first two graduating classes and the four major local newspapers, the board replaced him with Harry Brownell on July 2.\nManual was initially a three-year school with some general academic classes and an emphasis on mechanical and industrial training. Although graduates recall the school being viewed as blue-collar and academically inferior to Male High School in its early days, numerous early graduates went on to become medical doctors, and students published a literary magazine called \"The Crimson\" from 1899 to 1955. In order to accommodate newly added French and Latin classes, Manual was expanded to a four-year school in 1901. In 1911, Manual became the first school in Kentucky to serve lunches to students.\nIn 1913, Louisville Public Schools announced a plan to merge Manual and its rival Male High School into Louisville Boys High so that the two schools could share a new $300,000 facility. The plan took effect in 1915. Industrial training classes continued at the old Manual building. Parents objected to their children having to travel between the two buildings and the consolidation did not save the school board any money, so they voted to end the experiment in 1919. The new building became Male's home for the next 70 years and Manual returned to its old building at Brook and Oak. In 1923 an expansion added new laboratories, a cafeteria, and the largest gym ever built in Louisville at the time. The addition eventually burned and had to be destroyed in 1991.\nManual's enrollment numbers, which had hovered around 400 since the 1890s, soared from 429 in 1919 to 1,039 in 1925. The Manual Crimsons football team, which had also been consolidated with Male's from 1915 to 1918, had great success in the 1920s, beating Male two years in a row for the first time in its history. Manual shared athletic facilities with Male for many years, but in the early 1920s alumni raised funds to construct Manual Stadium. The stadium opened in 1924 with 14,021 permanent seats. It was one of the largest high school stadiums in America at the time. The original structure was condemned and closed in 1952 after years of heavy use and minimal upkeep, and was reopened after being rebuilt in 1954. Its modern capacity is 11,463.\nLouisville Girls High School.\nThe Louisville Girls High School opened as Female High School in 1856 at what became the intersection of Armory Place and Muhammad Ali Boulevard. It was the female counterpart to Male High School, also opened in 1856, and they were the first two public high schools in Louisville. Female High School moved to a location on First Street north of Chestnut in 1864 and remained there until 1899 when it moved to a location at Fifth and Hill Streets. It changed its name to Louisville Girls High School in 1911.\nIn 1934, the school moved into Reuben Post Halleck Hall, which had just been completed. The building was initially home to the Girls High School on the second and third floors, and Louisville Junior High School on the first. Over 12,000 women graduated from the school in its 94 years of operation.\nMerger.\nBy the 1940s, budget concerns and national trends made it clear that Louisville Girls High School and duPont Manual would merge into one coeducational school. They finally did so in September 1950 and remained in the old Louisville Girls High School building. This fusion of institutions resulted in the birth of the modern duPont Manual High School \u2013 dropping 'Training' from its previous name. The same school building remains in use today, although two major additions have since been made. The middle school located on the building's first floor became Manly Junior High and moved to Manual's old building at Brook and Oak.\nThe merged school began developing traditions such as Homecoming in 1951, and Red and White Day in 1953. Red and White Day eventually became a full week of school spirit related activities preceding the annual Male-Manual football game. Two traditions of the sexually segregated past, sororities and the all-male Mitre Club, persisted into the 1950s as unofficial organizations but gradually faded away. Students began publishing a newspaper, \"The Crimson Record\", in 1955.\nFollowing the \"Brown v. Board of Education\" Supreme Court decision, Manual became racially integrated without controversy in 1956 and graduated its first two black students in 1958. Starting in the 1960s, Manual began to face problems associated with inner city schools in the United States as economically advantaged families moved towards Louisville's suburbs. Manual was exempt from court-ordered busing in the 1970s because its racial makeup already met federal guidelines.\nOn November 11, 1976, what school board members referred to as a race-related riot occurred on campus, injuring 16 and leading to six arrests and 60 suspensions. Students and school administrators agreed that there was an atmosphere of racial tension brewing at Manual in the 1970s that led to the riot. In his 2005 book on the history of Manual, Mike McDaniel wrote that November 11, 1976 was \"quite probably the worst day in the history of Manual.\"\nThe late 1960s and 1970s were a time of major change at Manual. A new wing featuring a gym with a seating capacity of 2,566 opened in 1971. The school had as many as 3,360 students in the 1971\u201372 school year, necessitating 17 portable classrooms in the front and rear courtyards. Manual still had grades seven through twelve at this time, and overcrowding gradually began to improve after Manual dropped the seventh and eight grades when Noe Middle School opened in 1974. Throughout the decade the administration gradually dropped the last vestiges of its manual training emphasis as the number of shop classes dwindled from 16 in 1971 to three in 1979. The Youth Performing Arts School, actually a magnet school within Manual, opened in 1978 and, along with the changing curriculum, presaged Manual's transition to an academically intensive magnet school in the 1980s.\nMagnet school.\nManual became a magnet school in 1984, creating specialty programs and allowing students from around the district to apply to attend. The change initially met with a mixed reaction, especially as most freshmen and sophomores were to be transferred to other schools. One critic in the black community called the plan \"one-way busing\". A few days after the proposal was announced, about 300 students walked out of class at Manual and marched to Central High School, where most of them were being transferred, in protest. The protest succeeded in persuading the school board to modify the proposal to exclude sophomores from being transferred.\nThe magnet programs succeeded in attracting applicants and by the mid-1990s only about a third of students who applied were accepted. In the midst of the transition to magnet school, Manual underwent a $1.9 million building improvement plan which added computer and science labs. Also in 1991, the United States Department of Education recognized Manual as a Blue Ribbon School, the highest honor the department can bestow on a school. The school earned a Blue Ribbon award again in 2020.\nMany interior shots of the 1999 film \"The Insider\" were filmed at Manual. Dr. Jeffrey Wigand, the subject of the film, taught science and Japanese at Manual after he was fired by tobacco company Brown &amp; Williamson in 1993.\nBuilding and campus.\nManual classrooms and offices are located in three buildings spread over two city blocks. The main building was originally called Reuben Post Halleck Hall and was home to the Louisville Girls High School before it merged with Manual. The Gothic-style building was completed in 1934 at a cost of $1.1 million. The tract it was built on had previously been the site of the old Masonic Widows and Orphans Home.\nIn 1967 an urban renewal program demolished a residential block east of the main building to create a running track and various athletic fields. The project doubled Manual's campus to its modern size of . This was a part of a larger city-funded effort which created Noe Middle School north of Manual and increased the size of the University of Louisville campus, which was originally touted as a plan to create a continuous chain of schools over many blocks. Manual even became a home for two of the university's women's athletic teams. In the 1980s, the U of L women's basketball team used Manual's gym as a part-time home, playing a total of 40 games in eight seasons there. The U of L volleyball team used the Manual gym as its primary home from 1977 through 1990, after which the team moved into the newly built Cardinal Arena on its own campus. In 1992, Manual began a $3.5 million renovation of the main building which included a new roof and a glass-enclosed cafeteria for juniors and seniors.\nThe Youth Performing Arts School has its own building a half-block from Manual's main building. It was completed in 1978 at a cost of $1.5 million as the final stage of the same plan that expanded Manual's campus and built Noe. Noe had been built without an auditorium in anticipation of a theater-oriented school being built on site. The YPAS building includes production facilities, a costume shop and an 886-seat proscenium-style theater. The YPAS building did not contain extensive classroom space, however, and for many years teachers conducted YPAS classes in hallways and on loading docks if other space wasn't available. Since 1993, YPAS has used an adjacent facility, built in 1899 and formerly home to Cochran Elementary, as an annex.\nAcademics.\nManual focused on industrial training early in its history, but by the late 1970s it had a standard curriculum. In 1980, Iowa Test of Basic Skills scores ranked Manual 23rd out of the 24 high schools in the county. Under principal Joe Liedtke, academics improved, especially after Manual became a magnet school in 1984 and could attract students from throughout the county.\nAll students enroll in one of five magnet programs. The High School University (HSU) magnet offers a traditional college preparatory curriculum with electives. The Math/Science/Technology (MST) magnet specifically prepares students for college programs in engineering, science and math. Minimal requirements for MST students include courses in algebra, trigonometry, calculus (including mandatory AP Calculus), biology, chemistry and computer programming. The Journalism &amp; Communication (J&amp;C) magnet focuses on journalism, publishing, and media production. To earn class credit, J&amp;C students can participate in the creation of the school's national award-winning publications and productions: yearbook (\"The Crimson\"), a city-wide youth newsmagazine (\"On the Record\"), literary magazine (\"One\" \"Blue\" \"Wall\"), a school news website (\"RedEye\") and a daily morning television show called CSPN-TV, which is streamed online and broadcast to classrooms. The J&amp;C program was formerly known as CMA (Communications and Media Arts), but the name was changed so that the Manual program's specific emphasis on journalism would be reflected in the name, distinguishing the magnet from others in the district with similar names.\nAdmission to the HSU, MST and J&amp;C magnets are decided by a committee of Manual teachers based on academic performance as measured by prior school grades and the Commonwealth Accountability Testing System, although extracurricular involvement is also considered. The acceptance rate to each magnet varies with the number of applicants in any given year; in the mid-1990s about a third of applicants to these three magnets were selected each year. Admission the other two magnets, Visual Arts and the Youth Performing Arts School, are decided based primarily on auditions.\nThe Visual Arts magnet is located in a wing of art classrooms and features an art show each year for graduating seniors. The Visual Arts magnet provides students with the opportunity to work with a variety of media, including clay/sculpture, fibers, printmaking, painting, drawing and graphic design. The Math/Science/Technology program and the Youth Performing Arts School have achieved national recognition on multiple occasions.\nIn 1994, Manual began offering Advanced Placement (AP) courses. In 2001 it offered 45 AP courses, more than any other school in the state. Qualifying students may take college courses free of charge at the University of Louisville, which is located directly south of Manual. In 2000, Manual implemented block scheduling, which allowed students to take eight classes per year, which are scheduled four per day on alternating days.\nSince 2000, Manual has held Kentucky's state record of 52 National Merit Semifinalists, ranking third in the United States for that year. Manual's academic team won state titles at Governor's Cup, Kentucky's top high school academic competition, in 1993, 1994, 2005, and 2013. Matt Morris, a Manual graduate who was on the 1993 and 1994 teams, was the 1994 Teen Champion on \"Jeopardy!\". Three other Manual students have competed on \"Jeopardy!\". Manual's academic teams have also won both National Science Bowl and National Academic League championships, and achieved 7th place at the NAQT's High School National Championships. Manual has a history of one of the top policy debate programs in the state. In the 1990s Manual students won the Jefferson County championships most years and qualified teams for the National Forensic League tournament and the TOC Tournament of Champions. Manual has been mentioned several times in lists of America's top high schools in \"Redbook\" and \"Newsweek\" magazines. In 2002, Manual was separated from the rest of the schools in its district and made to hold its own regional science fair.\nIn 2015, duPont Manual had the distinction of being the high school that sent the most students to the INTEL International Science and Engineering Fair (ISEF).\nIn 2022, duPont Manual was ranked #47 in the National Rankings, #1 in Kentucky High Schools, #1 in Louisville, KY Metro Area High Schools, and #1 in Jefferson County Public Schools High Schools.\nYouth Performing Arts School.\nThe Youth Performing Arts School (YPAS) is one of only two programs in Kentucky allowing high school students to major in performing arts. Between 1995 and 2005, 90% of YPAS students received college scholarships totaling an average of over one million dollars per year. YPAS has its own building a half-block from Manual's main building, which includes classrooms, production facilities, a costume shop and an 886-seat proscenium-style theater. Since 1993, YPAS has used an adjacent facility, built in 1899 and formerly home to Cochran Elementary, as an annex.\nYPAS is one of Manual's magnet programs and YPAS students take their academic classes at Manual and must complete the same academic requirements as any public school student in Kentucky. Unlike the other magnets, YPAS is semi-autonomous; it has its own assistant principals, counselor, administrative staff, and parents' organization. Many Manual students take classes at YPAS, even if it is not their academic major.\nStudents at YPAS major in vocal music, instrumental music (band, orchestra, piano, or guitar), dance, theater, design and production, or musical theatre. YPAS instructors are school teachers recruited from around the district for their backgrounds in the arts. The YPAS choir was the only chorus to perform at the January 2001 inauguration of President George W. Bush.\nAthletics.\nOther sports.\nJohn Reccius, an early Major League Baseball player, organized Manual's first baseball team in 1900. An early baseball star was Ferdie Schupp, who would go on to pitch in the 1917 World Series, but left Manual two months before graduating. Manual claims seven \"mythical\" state baseball championships and has won six official ones, most recently in 1962.

{"id": "74342", "revid": "35936988", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=74342", "title": "Sainte-Chapelle", "text": "French royal chapel in Paris, France\nThe Sainte-Chapelle (; ) is a royal chapel in the Gothic style, within the medieval Palais de la Cit\u00e9, the residence of the Kings of France until the 14th century, on the \u00cele de la Cit\u00e9 in the River Seine in Paris, France.\nConstruction began sometime after 1238 and the chapel was consecrated on 26 April 1248. The Sainte-Chapelle is considered among the highest achievements of the Rayonnant period of Gothic architecture. It was commissioned by King Louis IX of France to house his collection of Passion relics, including Christ's claimed Crown of Thorns \u2013 one of the most important relics in medieval Christendom. This was later held in the nearby Notre-Dame Cathedral until the 2019 fire, which it survived.\nAlong with the Conciergerie, Sainte-Chapelle is one of the earliest surviving buildings of the Capetian royal palace on the \u00cele de la Cit\u00e9. Although damaged during the French Revolution and restored in the 19th century, it has one of the most extensive 13th-century stained glass collections anywhere in the world.\nThe chapel is now operated as a museum by the , along with the nearby Conciergerie, the other remaining vestige of the original palace.\nHistory.\nConstruction of France.\nSainte-Chapelle was inspired by the earlier Carolingian royal chapels, notably the Palatine Chapel of Charlemagne at his palace in Aix-la-Chapelle (now Aachen). It was built in about 800 and served as the oratory of the Emperor. In 1238 Louis IX had already built one royal chapel, attached to the Ch\u00e2teau de Saint-Germain-en-Laye. This earlier chapel had only one level; its plan, on a much grander scale, was adapted for Sainte-Chapelle.\nThe two levels of the new chapel, equal in size, had entirely different purposes. The upper level, where the sacred relics were kept, was reserved exclusively for the royal family and their guests. The lower level was used by the courtiers, servants, and soldiers of the palace. It was a very large structure, long, wide, and high, ranking in size with the new Gothic cathedrals in France.\nIn addition to serving as a place of worship, the Sainte-Chapelle played an important role in the political and cultural ambitions of King Louis and his successors. With the imperial throne at Constantinople occupied by a mere Count of Flanders and with the Holy Roman Empire in uneasy disarray, Louis' artistic and architectural patronage helped to position him as the central monarch of western Christendom, the Sainte-Chapelle fitting into a long tradition of prestigious palace chapels. Just as the Emperor could pass privately from his palace into the Hagia Sophia in Constantinople, so now Louis could pass directly from his palace into the Sainte-Chapelle. More importantly, the two-story palace chapel had obvious similarities to Charlemagne's palatine chapel at Aachen (built 782\u2013805)\u2014a parallel that Louis was keen to exploit in presenting himself as a worthy successor to the first Holy Roman Emperor. The presence of the fragment of the True Cross and crown of thorns gave enormous prestige to Louis IX. Pope Innocent IV proclaimed that it meant that Christ had symbolically crowned Louis with his own crown.\nThe Royal Chapel.\nSainte-Chapelle, in the courtyard of the royal palace on the \u00cele de la Cit\u00e9 (now part of a later administrative complex known as La Conciergerie), was built to house Louis IX's collection of relics of Christ, which included the crown of thorns, the Image of Edessa, and some thirty other items. Louis purchased his Passion relics from Baldwin II, the Latin emperor at Constantinople, for the sum of 135,000 livres. This money was paid to the Venetians to whom the relics had been pawned. \nThe relics arrived in Paris in August 1239, carried from Venice by two Dominican friars. Upon arrival, King Louis hosted a week-long celebratory reception for the relics. For the final stage of their journey they were carried by Louis IX himself, barefoot and dressed as a penitent, a scene depicted in the \"Relics of the Passion\" window on the south side of the chapel. The relics were stored in a large and elaborate silver chest, the \"Grand-Chasse\", on which Louis spent a further 100,000 livres. \nThe entire chapel, by contrast, cost 40,000 livres to build and glaze. Until it was completed in 1248, the relics were housed at chapels at the Ch\u00e2teau de Vincennes and a specially built chapel at the Ch\u00e2teau de Saint-Germain-en-Laye. In 1246, fragments of the True Cross and the Holy Lance were added to Louis's collection, along with other relics. The chapel was consecrated on 26 April 1248 and Louis's relics were moved to their new home with great ceremony. Shortly afterward, the King departed on the Seventh Crusade, in which he was captured and later ransomed and released. In 1704, the French composer Marc-Antoine Charpentier was buried in the chapel's small cemetery, but this cemetery no longer exists.\nThe Parisian scholastic Jean de Jandun praised the building as one of Paris' most beautiful structures in his \"Tractatus de laudibus Parisius\" (1323), citing:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;that most beautiful of chapels, the chapel of the king, most decently situated within the walls of the king's house, enjoys a complete and indissoluble structure of the most solid stone. The most excellent colors of the pictures, the precious gilding of the images, the beautiful transparence of the ruddy windows on all sides, the most beautiful cloths of the altars, the wondrous merits of the sanctuary, the figures of the reliquaries externally adorned with dazzling gems, bestow such a hyperbolic beauty on that house of prayer, that, in going into it below, one understandably believes oneself, as if rapt to heaven, to enter one of the best chambers of Paradise.\nO how salutary prayers to the all-powerful God pour out in these oratories, when the internal and spiritual purities of those praying correspond proportionally with the external and physical elegance of the oratory!\nO how peacefully to the most holy God the praises are sung in these tabernacles, when the hearts of those singers are by the pleasing pictures of the tabernacle analogically beautified with the virtues!\nO how acceptable to the most glorious God appear the offerings on these altars, when the life of those sacrificing shines in correspondence with the gilded light of the altars!\nModifications (16th\u201318th century).\nThe chapel underwent considerable modification in the centuries that followed. A new two-story building, the Treasury of Chartres, was attached to the chapel on the north side shortly after it was completed. It remained until 1783, when it was demolished to build the new Palace of Justice. Another building, which served as a vestiary and sacristy, as well as residence for the guardian of the treasury, was placed on the north side. In the 15th century, Louis X of France built a monumental enclosed stairway from the courtyard on the south side to the upper level. This was damaged by fire in 1630, rebuilt, but finally demolished. Fires in the palace in 1630 and 1776 also caused considerable damage, especially to the furniture, and a flood in the winter of 1689\u20131690 caused major damage to the painted walls of the lower chapel. The original stained glass on the ground floor was removed, and the floor raised. The original ground floor glass was replaced by Gothic-style windows in the 19th century.\nRevolutionary vandalism (18th century).\nSainte-Chapelle, as both a symbol of religion and royalty, was a prime target for vandalism during the French Revolution. The chapel was turned into a storehouse for grain, and the sculpture and royal emblems on the exterior were smashed. The spire was pulled down. Some of the stained glass was broken or dispersed, but nearly two-thirds of the glass today is original; some of the original glass was relocated in other windows, The sacred relics were dispersed although some survive as the \"relics of Sainte-Chapelle\" in the treasury of Notre-Dame de Paris. Various reliquaries, including the \"grande ch\u00e2sse\", were melted down for their precious metal.\nRestoration (19th\u201321st century).\nBetween 1803 and 1837, the upper chapel was turned into a depository for the archives of the Palace of Justice next door. The lower of stained glass was removed to facilitate working light. Some of the glass was used to replace broken glass in other windows, and other panes were put on the market. \nBeginning in 1835, scholars, archeologists and writers demanded that the church be preserved and restored to its medieval state. In 1840, under King Louis-Philippe, a long campaign of restoration began. It was first conducted by F\u00e9lix Duban, then by Jean-Baptiste Lassus and \u00c9mile Boeswillwald, with the young Eug\u00e8ne Viollet-le-Duc as an assistant. The work continued for twenty-eight years, and served as a training ground for a generation of archeologists and restorers. It was faithful to the original drawings and descriptions of the chapel that survived.\nThe restoration of the stained glass was a parallel project, which lasted from 1846 until 1855, with the goal of returning the chapel to its original appearance. It was carried out by the glass craftsmen Antoine Lusson and Mar\u00e9chal de Metz and the designer Louis Steinheil. About one third of the glass, added in later years, was removed and replaced with medieval glass from other sources, or with new glass made in the original Gothic style. Eighteen of the original panels are found today in the Mus\u00e9e de Cluny in Paris.\nThe stained glass was removed and placed into safe storage during World War II. In 1945 a layer of external varnish had been applied to protect the glass from the dust and scratches of wartime bombing. This had gradually darkened, making the already fading images even harder to see. In 2008, a more comprehensive seven-year programme of restoration began, costing some \u20ac10 million to clean and preserve all the stained glass, clean the facade stonework and conserve and repair some of the sculptures. Half of the funding was provided by private donors, the other half coming from the Villum Foundation. Included in the restoration was an innovative thermoformed glass layer applied outside the stained-glass windows for added protection. The restoration of the flamboyant rose window on the west facade was completed in 2015 in time for the 800th anniversary of the birth of St. Louis.\nDescription.\nThe royal chapel is a prime example of the phase of Gothic architectural style called \"Rayonnant\", marked by its sense of weightlessness and strong vertical emphasis. It stands squarely upon a lower chapel, which served as parish church for all the inhabitants of the palace, which was the seat of government.\nExterior.\nThe contemporary visitor entering the courtyard of the Royal Palace would have been met by the sight of a grand ceremonial staircase (the \"Grands Degres\") to their right and the north flank and eastern apse of the Sainte-Chapelle to their left. The chapel exterior shows many of the typical characteristics of Rayonnant architecture\u2014deep buttresses surmounted by pinnacles, crocketted gables around the roof-line and vast windows subdivided by bar tracery. The internal division into upper and lower chapels is clearly marked on the outside by a string-course, the lower walls pierced by smaller windows with a distinctive spherical triangle shape. Despite its decoration, the exterior is relatively simple and austere, devoid of flying buttresses or major sculpture and giving little hint of the richness within.\nNo designer-builder is named in the archives concerned with the construction. In the 19th century it was assumed (as with so many buildings of medieval Paris) to be the work of the master mason Pierre de Montreuil, who worked on the remodelling of the Royal Abbey of Saint-Denis and completed the south transept fa\u00e7ade of Notre-Dame Cathedral in Paris. Modern scholarship rejects this attribution in favour of Jean de Chelles or Thomas de Cormont, while Robert Branner saw in the design the hand of an unidentified master mason from Amiens.\nThe Sainte-Chapelle's most obvious architectural precursors include the apsidal chapels of Amiens Cathedral, which it resembles in its general form, and the Bishop's Chapel (c. 1180s) of Noyon Cathedral, from which it borrowed the two-story design. a major influence on its overall design may have come from contemporary metalwork, particularly the precious shrines and reliquaries made by Mosan goldsmiths.\nThough the buttresses are substantial, they are too close to the vault to counter its side thrust. Metal elements such as iron rods or chains, able to support tension, were used to replace the flying buttresses of previous structures.\nWest front.\nThe west front is composed of a porch two levels high, beneath a flamboyant Gothic rose window installed in the upper chapel in the 15th century. At the top is a pointed arch an oculus window, and a balustrade around the bottom of the roof, decorated with interlaced fleur-de-lys emblems placed by Charles V of France. On either side of the porch are towers which contain the narrow winding stairways to the upper chapel, and which also hide the buttresses. The spires of the towers are also decorated with royal fleur-des-lys beneath a sculpted crown of thorns. This decoration dates to the 15th century, and was restored in about 1850 by Geoffroy-Dechaume.\nThe portal of the upper chapel is located on the balcony of the upper level. The original sculpture of the west portal was smashed during the Revolution. It was restored by Geoffroy-Dechaume between 1854 and 1873.\nSpire.\nThe current spire, high, is the fifth to be built at Sainte-Chapelle since the 13th century. The appearance of the first is unknown, but the second, built in 1383 under Charles V, is pictured in an illustration of the Tres Riches Heures du Duc de Berry. He replaced it with another in about 1460, but this spire burned in 1630. It was replaced by another, which was destroyed following the French Revolution in 1793. The present spire was built of cedar wood by the architect Lassus beginning in 1852. The sculpture decorating the spire was designed in 1853 by Geoffroy-Dechaume. The painter-designer Steinheil designed the sculpture at the base of the spire, and his face appears as two of the apostles, Saint Thomas and Saint Bartholomew. Above the gables are statues representing angels carrying the instruments of The Passion. Above the chevet is a statue of the Archangel Michael slaying a dragon. Around the feet of the archangel are sculptures, also designed by Geoffroy-Dechaume, of eight persons, portrayed by workers of the reconstruction, laying wreaths at the Archangel's feet.\nInterior.\nSaint Chapelle, built to house a reliquary, was itself like a precious reliquary turned inside out (with the richest decoration on the inside). Although the interior is dominated by the stained glass (see below), every inch of the remaining wall surface and the vault was also richly coloured and decorated. Analysis of remaining paint fragments reveals that the original colours were much brighter than those favoured by the 19th-century restorers and would have been closer to the colours of the stained glass. The quatrefoils of the dado arcade were painted with scenes of saints and martyrs and inset with painted and gilded glass, emulating Limoges enamels, while rich textiles hangings added to the richness of the interior.\nThe most striking aspect and original feature of the plan is the nearly total absence of masonry walls in the upper chapel. The walls are replaced by pillars and buttresses, and the space between is almost entirely glass, filling the upper chapel with light.\nLower Chapel.\nThe lower chapel was dedicated to the Virgin Mary, and was used by the non-royal inhabitants of the neighbouring Royal Palace. The portal of the chapel represents the Virgin Mary as a column statue. The portal, and almost all the decoration of the chapel, was created by Geoffroy-Duchaume between 1854 and 1858. The primary decorative themes of the sculpture, columns and murals are the Fleur-de-Lys emblem of Louis IX and a stylised castle, the coat of arms of Blanche of Castile, the mother of Louis IX.\nThe lower chapel is only high, with a six-meter wide central vessel and two narrow side aisles. The supports of the ceiling vaults are unusual; the outward thrust of the vaults is counterbalanced by small, elegant arched buttresses between the outer and inner columns, and they are also reinforced by a metallic structure hidden under the paint and plaster.\nThe one-hundred forty capitals of the columns are an important decorative feature; they are from the mid-13th century, and predate the columns of the upper chapel. They have floral decoration of acanthus leaves typical of the period. Each of the gilded leaves corresponds with a slender colonette above, which rises upward to support the vaults. The columns are painted with alternating floral designs and the castle emblem of Castile. The red, gold and blue painting dates to the 19th century restoration.\nThe original stained glass of the lower chapel was destroyed by a flood in 1690; it was replaced by colourless glass. The present glass depicts scenes from the life of the Virgin Mary, surrounded by grisaille glass, while the apse has more elaborate and colourful scenes from the Virgin's life. All the windows were designed by Steinheil during the 19th century restoration. The lower chapel originally had a doorway to the sacristy on the left lateral traverse. Since it could not have a window, it was decorated in the 13th century with a mural of the Annunciation. This was rediscovered during the 19th-century work, and restored by Steinheil.\nUpper Chapel.\nThe upper chapel is reached by narrow stairways in the towers from lower level. The structure is simple; a rectangle , with four traverses and an apse at the east end with seven bays of windows. The most striking features are the walls, which appear to be almost entirely made of stained glass; a total of of glass, not counting the rose window at the west end. This was a clever illusion created by the master builder; each vertical support of the windows is composed of seven slender columns, which disguise their full thickness. In addition, the walls and windows are braced on the exterior by two belts of iron chain, one at the mid-level of the bays and the other at the top of the lancets; these are hidden behind the bars holding the stained glass. Additional metal supports are hidden under the eaves of the roof to brace the windows against the wind or other stress. Furthermore, the windows of the nave are slightly higher than the windows in the apse ( compared with ), making the chapel appear longer than it actually is.\nThere are two small alcoves set into the walls on the third traverse of the chapel, with archivolts or arches richly decorated above with painting and sculpture of angels. These were the places where the King and Queen worshipped during religious services; the King on the north side, the Queen on the south.\nStained glass.\nThe most famous features of the chapel, among the finest of their type in the world, are the fifteen great stained-glass windows in the nave and apse of the upper chapel, which date from the mid-13th century, as well as the later rose window (put in place in the 15th century). The stone wall surface is reduced to little more than a delicate framework. The thousands of small pieces of glass turn the walls into great screens of coloured light, largely deep blues and reds, which gradually change in intensity from hour to hour.\nMost of the windows were put into place between 1242 and 1248. The names of the glass artists are unknown, but the art historian Louis Grodecki identified what appear to be three different ateliers with different styles. The windows in the apse and most of the windows on the north wall of the nave are made by one workshop. These works are known for supple forms and costumes, with simplified features. The second workshop, named by Grodecki as Master of the Ezekiel window, made the Ezekiel and Daniel windows, as well as the window of the Kings. That work is characterized by elongated forms, and more elaborate and angular draperies. The third artist or workshop is called the Master of Judith and Esther, for the distinct style of those windows, as well as the window of Job. They are distinguished by more subtle details in the faces, and a resemblance to the figures in illuminated manuscripts.\nDespite some damage the windows display a clear iconographical programme. The three windows of the eastern apse illustrate the New Testament, featuring scenes of The Passion (centre) with the Infancy of Christ (left) and the Life of John the Evangelist (right). By contrast, the windows of the nave are dominated by Old Testament exemplars of ideal kingship/queenship in an obvious nod to their royal patrons. The cycle starts at the western bay of the north wall with scenes from the Book of Genesis (heavily restored). The next ten windows of the nave follow clockwise with scenes from Exodus, Joseph, Numbers/Leviticus, Joshua/Deuteronomy, Judges, (moving to the south wall) Jeremiah/Tobias, Judith/Job, Esther, David and the Book of Kings. The final window, occupying the westernmost bay of the south wall brings this narrative of sacral kingship right up to date with a series of scenes showing the rediscovery of Christ's relics, the miracles they performed, and their relocation to Paris in the hands of King Louis himself.\nThe west rose window.\nThe rose window at the west of the upper chapel was made in the late 15th century, later than the other windows. It is a very fine example of the flamboyant Gothic style, named for the flamelike curling designs. It is nine meters in diameter, and is composed of eighty-nine separate panels representing scenes of the Apocalypse. The 15th-century glass artists used a new technique, called silver stain, which allowed them to paint on the glass with enamel paints, and to use fire to fuse the paint onto the glass. This allowed them to modify the color, and create shading and other fine details. It was thoroughly cleaned in 2014\u201315, giving it greater brightness and clarity.\nStained glass from Saint-Chapelle in other museums.\nSome of the early stained glass that was removed from Saint-Chapelle is now found in the other museums, including the National Museum of the Middle Ages, or Mus\u00e9e de Cluny, in Paris and the Victoria and Albert Museum in London. \nArt and decoration.\nSculpture.\nMost of the sculpture of the portals was destroyed during the French Revolution, but between 1855 and 1870 the sculptor Adolphe-Victor Geoffroy-Dechaume was able to recreate it, using 18th century descriptions and engravings. One of the major works he recreated was the tympanum over the portal of the upper chapel, with a figure of Christ giving a blessing, with the Virgin Mary and John the Baptist alongside him. Two angels are behind him, holding the crown of thorns and the cross, the most famous relics of the chapel. On the lintel below, the sculpture depicts Saint Michael weighing the souls of the dead, with those sent to heaven on the left and those damned on the right. Sculpted Biblical scenes from the Old Testament fill the panels on lower walls, including the Creation and Noah's ark. They were made by Geoffroy-Dechaume in 1869\u201370.\nWhile most of the sculpture on the exterior dates to the 19th century, the apse of the upper chapel contains a number of original 12th-century statues, which, unlike the exterior statues, were polychrome. Traces of color were found during the restoration in the 19th century, and the statues were restored to include those colors. The arches of the tribune in the apse at the east end, where the case of sacred relics was placed, is ornamented with the original polychrome angels from the 13th century.\nThe upper chapel walls also displayed a group of sixteen statues of the Apostles, which date to about 1240. Some portray the apostles in simple classical costumes and bare feet, while others are polychrome and have much more elaborate clerical costumes. Some of these statues are now found in the collection of the National Museum of the Middle Ages in the Mus\u00e9e de Cluny.\nPainting.\nThe goal of the two principal architects of the 19th-century restoration, Durban and Lassus, was to recreate the interior, as much as possible, as it appeared in the 13th century. They collected traces of the original polychrome paint from the columns, and in 1842 presented a comprehensive plan for interior decoration. In the soubassements, the lower portions where no traces of original color were found, they used a neutral tone, to avoid conflicting with the colors of the stained glass windows. For their palette of colors on other decoration, they drew upon the illuminations of a 13th-century book of Psalm from the Royal Library. They systematically repainted the forty-four 13th-century quadrilobe medallions on the stone arches of the soubassements, which depicted the martyrdom of saints presented against a gilded background. In 1845 Steinheil continued by repainting all of the medallions of the nave, with the exception of those in the two royal alcoves, following the original compositions. In 1983 the Service of Historic Monuments cleaned four of the medallions which had not been restored, and un-restored two which had been repainted, to study the original traces of paint from before 1845.\nThe relics and the reliquary.\nThe principal relics for which the chapel was built were the crown of thorns, believed to have been worn by Christ during his Passion, and a small piece of the cross on which he was crucified. These were found in Constantinople, which had been captured by the Crusaders in 1204, and was then ruled by Baudouin II of Cortenay. Baudouin agreed to sell the crown for 135,000 livres, which went primarily to Venetian bankers, to whom he had mortgaged the crown to pay for the defence of the city. By purchasing the crown, Louis gained the prestige of funding the conquest of Constantinople, as well as displaying his personal devotion. The crown arrived in August 1239 and was placed in the earlier royal chapel of St. Nicholas, near the palace. Two years later, he made an additional purchase from Baudouin of a piece of the True Cross and other relics related to the Passion, which were brought to Paris in September 1241. Thereafter, on each Holy Friday, the day of the Crucifixion, he conducted a solemn ceremony at Sainte-Chapelle, in which the relic was brought out and displayed to the faithful.\nThe King had a large chasse made to hold and display the sacred objects. This was a case, open on the front, long, made of silver and gilded copper. Each of the individual objects had its own case of precious metal with jewels. This was originally placed above the altar, but between 1264 and 1267, it was placed atop a high tribune in the apse of the church, where everyone could see it. In 1306, a new sacred relic was added: a portion of the skull of Louis himself, since he had been declared a saint.\nDuring the French Revolution, the Chasse and the vessels holding the relics were taken apart and melted down for their jewels and precious metals. The fragment of the cross was transferred first in 1793 to a collection of antiquities, then given to the Bishop of Paris. A new reliquary of gold and crystal was made for the crown of thorns. Since the Concordat of 1801, it was displayed in the treasury of the cathedral of Notre Dame de Paris, but it was saved from the Notre-Dame de Paris fire on 15 April 2019 and was kept temporarily in the Louvre Museum. It returned to the cathedral in December of 2024.\nOrgan.\nAn organ is attested from the beginning; it was replaced in 1493, 1550 and 1762. It was not until July 1791 when the organ was transferred from the Sainte-Chapelle to Saint-Germain l'Auxerrois due to the French Revolution. The organ was built by Fran\u00e7ois-Henri Clicquot, in a case designed by Pierre-No\u00ebl Rousset in 1752. However, its Neoclassical style seems to some writers to be too modern for that date.\nOther \"Saintes-Chapelles\".\nPrior to the dissolution of the Sainte-Chapelle in 1803, following the French Revolution, the term \"Sainte-Chapelle royale\" also referred not only to the building but to the \"chapelle\" itself, the choir of Sainte-Chapelle. However, the term was also applied to a number of other buildings. \nLouis IX's chapel inspired several \"copies\", in the sense of royal or ducal chapels of broadly similar architectural form, built to house relics, particularly fragments of Louis' Passion Relics given by the King. Such chapels were normally attached to a ducal palace (e.g. Bourges, Riom), or else to an Abbey with particular links to the royal family (e.g. St-Germer-de-Fly). As with the original, such Holy Chapels were nearly always additional to the regular palatine or abbatial chapel, with their own dedicated clergy\u2014usually established as a college of canons. For the patrons, such chapels served not only as public expressions of personal piety but also as valuable diplomatic tools, encouraging important visitors to come and venerate their relics and showing their connection to the French crown. Notable \"Saintes-Chapelles\" in France include:\nAs the status of Saint Louis grew among Europe's aristocracy, the influence of his famous chapel also extended beyond France, with important copies at Karl\u0161tejn Castle near Prague (c.\u20091360), the Hofburgkapelle in Vienna (consecrated 1449), Collegiate Church of the Holy Cross and St. Bartholomew, Wroc\u0142aw (c. 1350) and Exeter College, Oxford (1860).\nReferences.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Born into the House of Nassau, he became Prince of Orange in 1544 and is thereby the founder of the Orange-Nassau branch and the ancestor of the monarchy of the Netherlands. In the Netherlands, he is also known as Father of the Fatherland (; ).\nA wealthy nobleman, William originally served the Habsburgs as a member of the court of Margaret of Parma, governor of the Spanish Netherlands. Unhappy with the centralisation of political power away from the local estates and with the Spanish persecution of Dutch Protestants, William joined the Dutch uprising and turned against his former masters. The most influential and politically capable of the rebels, he led the Dutch to several successes in the fight against the Spanish. Declared an outlaw by the Spanish king in 1580, he was assassinated by Balthasar G\u00e9rard in Delft in 1584.\nEarly life and education.\nWilliam was born on 24 April 1533 at Dillenburg Castle in the County of Nassau-Dillenburg, in the Holy Roman Empire (now in Hesse, German Federal Republic). He was the eldest son of Count William I of Nassau-Siegen and his second wife, Countess Juliana of Stolberg. William's father had one surviving daughter by his previous marriage to Walburga of Egmont, and his mother had four surviving children by her previous marriage to Philipp II, Count of Hanau-M\u00fcnzenberg. His parents had twelve children together, of whom William was the eldest; he had four younger brothers and seven younger sisters. The family was religiously devout and William was raised a Lutheran.\nIn 1544, William's agnatic (patrilineal) first cousin, Ren\u00e9 of Chalon, Prince of Orange, died in the siege of St Dizier, childless. In his testament, Ren\u00e9 of Chalon named William the heir to all his estates and titles, including that of Prince of Orange, on the condition that he receive a Roman Catholic education. William's father acquiesced to this condition on behalf of his 11-year-old son, and this was the founding of the House of Orange-Nassau. Besides the Principality of Orange (located today in France) and significant lands in Germany, William also inherited vast estates in the Low Countries (present-day Netherlands and Belgium) from his cousin. Because of William's young age, Emperor Charles V, who was the overlord of most of these estates, served no one.\nWilliam received his Catholic education in the Low Countries, first at his family's estate in Breda and later in Brussels under the supervision of the Emperor's sister Mary of Hungary, governor of the Habsburg Netherlands (Seventeen Provinces). In Brussels, he was taught foreign languages and received a military and diplomatic education under the direction of J\u00e9r\u00f4me Perrenot de Champagney, brother of Cardinal de Granvelle.\nOn 6 July 1551, William married Anna, daughter and heir of Maximiliaan van Egmond, an important Dutch nobleman, a match that had been secured by Charles V. Anna's father had died in 1548, and therefore William became Lord of Egmond and Count of Buren upon his wedding day. The marriage was a happy one and produced three children, one of whom died in infancy. Anna died on 24 March 1558, aged 25, leaving William much grieved.\nCareer.\nImperial favourite.\nBeing a ward of Charles V and having received his education under the tutelage of the Emperor's sister Mary, William came under the particular attention of the imperial family, and became a favourite. He was appointed captain in the cavalry in 1551 and received rapid promotion thereafter, becoming commander of one of the Emperor's armies at the age of 22. This was in 1555, when Charles sent him to Bayonne with an army of 20,000 to take the city in a siege from the French. William was also made a member of the Council of State, the highest political advisory council in the Netherlands. It was in November of the same year (1555) that the gout-afflicted Emperor Charles leaned on William's shoulder during the ceremony when he abdicated the Low Countries in favour of his son, Philip II of Spain. William was also selected to carry the insignia of the Holy Roman Empire to Charles's brother Ferdinand, when Charles resigned the imperial crown in 1556 and was one of the Spanish signatories for the April 1559 Treaty of Cateau-Cambr\u00e9sis.\nIn 1559, Philip II appointed William stadtholder (governor) of the provinces of Holland, Zeeland and Utrecht, thereby greatly increasing his political power. A stadtholdership over Franche-Comt\u00e9 followed in 1561.\nFrom politician to rebel.\nAlthough he never directly opposed the Spanish king, William soon became one of the most prominent members of the opposition in the Council of State, together with Philip de Montmorency, Count of Hoorn, and Lamoral, Count of Egmont. They were mainly seeking more political power for themselves against the \"de facto\" government of Count Berlaymont, Granvelle and Viglius of Aytta, but also for the Dutch nobility and, ostensibly, for the Estates, and complained that too many Spaniards were involved in governing the Netherlands. William was also dissatisfied with the increasing persecution of Protestants in the Netherlands. Brought up as a Lutheran and later a Catholic, William was very religious but was still a proponent of freedom of religion for all people. The activity of the Inquisition in the Netherlands, directed by Cardinal Granvelle, prime minister to the new governor Margaret of Parma (1522\u20131583, natural half-sister to Philip II), increased opposition to Spanish rule among the then mostly Catholic population of the Netherlands. Lastly, the opposition wished to see an end to the presence of Spanish troops.\nAccording to the \"Apology\", William's letter of justification, which was published and read to the States General in December 1580, his resolve to expel the Spaniards from the Netherlands had originated when, in the summer of 1559, he and the Duke of Alba had been sent to France as hostages for the proper fulfilment of the Treaty of Cateau-Cambr\u00e9sis following the Hispano-French war. During his stay in Paris, on a hunting trip to the Bois de Vincennes, King Henry II of France started to discuss with William a secret understanding between Philip II and himself aimed at the violent extermination of Protestantism in France, the Netherlands \"and the entire Christian world\". The understanding was being negotiated by Alba, and Henry had assumed, incorrectly, that William was aware of it. At the time, William did not contradict the king's assumption, but he had decided for himself that he would not allow the slaughter of \"so many honourable people\", especially in the Netherlands, for which he felt a strong compassion.\nOn 25 August 1561, William of Orange married for the second time. His new wife, Anna of Saxony, was described by contemporaries as \"self-absorbed, weak, assertive, and cruel\", and it is generally assumed that William married her to gain more influence in Saxony, Hesse and the Palatinate. The couple had five children. The marriage used Lutheran rites, and marked the beginning of a gradual change in his religious opinions, which was to lead William to revert to Lutheranism and eventually moderate Calvinism. Still, he remained tolerant of other religious opinions.\nUp to this time William's life had been marked by lavish display and extravagance. He surrounded himself with a retinue of young noblemen and dependents and kept open house in his magnificent Nassau palace at Brussels. Consequently, the revenue of his vast estates was not sufficient to prevent him being crippled by debt. But after his return from France, a change began to come over William. Philip made him councillor of state, knight of the Golden Fleece, and stadtholder of Holland, Zeeland and Utrecht, but there was a latent antagonism between the natures of the two men.\nUp to 1564, any criticism of governmental measures voiced by William and the other members of the opposition had ostensibly been directed at Granvelle; however, after the latter's departure early that year, William, who may have found increasing confidence in his alliance with the Protestant princes of Germany following his second marriage, began to openly criticise the King's anti-Protestant politics. In August of that year, Philip issued an order for carrying out the decrees of the anti-Protestant Council of Trent. But, in an iconic speech to the Council of State, William to the shock of his audience justified his conflict with Philip by saying that, even though he had decided for himself to keep to the Catholic faith (at the time), he could not agree that monarchs should rule over the souls of their subjects and take from them their freedom of belief and religion.\nIn early 1565, a large group of lesser noblemen, including William's younger brother Louis, formed the Confederacy of Noblemen. On 5 April, they offered a petition to Margaret of Parma, requesting an end to the persecution of Protestants. From August to October 1566, a wave of iconoclasm (known as the \"Beeldenstorm\") spread through the Low Countries. Calvinists (the major Protestant denomination), Anabaptists, and Mennonites, angered by Catholic oppression and theologically opposed to the Catholic use of images of saints (which in their eyes conflicted with the Second Commandment), destroyed statues in hundreds of churches and monasteries throughout the Netherlands.\nFollowing the Beeldenstorm, unrest in the Netherlands grew, and Margaret agreed to grant the wishes of the Confederacy, provided the noblemen would help to restore order. She also allowed more important noblemen, including William of Orange, to assist the Confederacy, and William went to Antwerp where he succeeded in quelling the riot. In late 1566, and early 1567, it became clear that she would not be allowed to fulfill her promises, and when several minor rebellions failed, many Calvinists and Lutherans fled the country. Following the announcement that Philip II, unhappy with the situation in the Netherlands, would dispatch his loyal general Fernando \u00c1lvarez de Toledo, 3rd Duke of Alba, or Alva (also known as \"The Iron Duke\"), to restore order, William laid down his functions and retreated to his native Nassau in April 1567. He had been financially involved with several of the rebellions.\nAfter his arrival in August 1567, Alba established the \"Council of Troubles\" (known to the people as the \"Council of Blood\") to judge those involved in the rebellion and the iconoclasm. William was one of the 10,000 to be summoned before the council, but he failed to appear. He was subsequently declared an outlaw, and his properties were confiscated. As one of the most prominent and popular politicians of the Netherlands, William of Orange emerged as the leader of armed resistance. He financed the \"Watergeuzen\", refugee Protestants who formed bands of corsairs and raided the coastal cities of the Netherlands (often killing Spanish and Dutch alike). He also raised an army, consisting mostly of German mercenaries, to fight Alba on land. William allied with the French Huguenots, following the end of the second Religious War in France when they had troops to spare. Led by his brother Louis, the army invaded the northern Netherlands in 1568. However, the plan failed almost from the start. The Huguenots were defeated by French royal troops before they could invade, and a small force under Jean de Villers was captured within two days. Villers gave all the plans of the campaign to the Spanish following his capture. On 23 May, the army under the command of Louis won the Battle of Heiligerlee in the northern province of Groningen against a Spanish army led by the stadtholder of the northern provinces, Jean de Ligne, Duke of Arenberg. Arenberg was killed in the battle, as was William's brother Adolf. Alba countered by killing a number of convicted noblemen (including the Counts of Egmont and Hoorn on 6 June), and then by leading an expedition to Groningen. There, he annihilated Louis' forces on German territory in the Battle of Jemmingen on 21 July, although Louis managed to escape. These two battles are now considered to be the start of the Eighty Years' War.\nWar.\nIn October 1568, William responded by leading a large army into Brabant, but Alba carefully avoided a decisive confrontation, expecting the army to fall apart quickly. As William advanced, disorder broke out in his army, and with winter approaching and money running out, William turned back and crossed into France. William made several more plans to invade in the next few years, but little came of them, since he lacked support and money. He remained popular with the public, in part through an extensive propaganda campaign conducted through pamphlets. One of his most important claims, with which he attempted to justify his actions, was that he was not fighting the rightful ruler of the land, the King of Spain, but only the inadequate rule of the foreign governors in the Netherlands, and the presence of foreign soldiers.\nOn 22 August 1571, his second wife Anna gave birth to a daughter, named Christina von Dietz, and fathered by Jan Rubens, best known as the father of painter Peter Paul Rubens; Jan Rubens had been sent by Anna's uncle in 1570 to manage her finances. Later that year, William had this marriage legally dissolved on the grounds that Anna was insane.\nOn 1 April 1572, a group known as the Watergeuzen (\"Sea Beggars\") captured the city of Brielle, which had been left unattended by the Spanish garrison. Contrary to their normal \"hit and run\" tactics, they occupied the town and claimed it for the prince by raising the Prince of Orange's flag above the city. This event was followed by other cities opening their gates for the Watergeuzen, and soon most cities in Holland and Zeeland were in the hands of the rebels, notable exceptions being Amsterdam and Middelburg. The rebel cities then called a meeting of the \"Staten Generaal\" (which they were technically unqualified to do), and reinstated William as the stadtholder of Holland and Zeeland.\nConcurrently, rebel armies captured cities throughout the entire country, from Deventer to Mons. William himself then advanced with his own army and marched into several cities in the south, including Roermond and Leuven. William had counted on intervention from the Huguenots as well, but this plan was thwarted after the St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre on 24 August, which signalled the start of a wave of violence against the Huguenots. After a successful Spanish attack on his army, William had to flee and he retreated to Enkhuizen, in Holland. The Spanish then organised countermeasures, and sacked several rebel cities, sometimes massacring their inhabitants, such as in Mechelen or Zutphen. They had more trouble with the cities in Holland, where they took Haarlem after seven months and a loss of 8,000 soldiers, and they had to break off their siege of Alkmaar.\nIn 1573, William joined the Calvinist Church. He appointed a Calvinist theologian, Jean Taffin (1573\u20131581) as his court preacher. Taffin was later joined by Pierre Loyseleur de Villiers (1577\u20131584), who also became an important political advisor to the prince.\n In 1574, William's armies won several minor battles, including several naval encounters. The Spanish, led by Don Luis de Z\u00fa\u00f1iga y Requesens since Philip replaced Alba in 1573, also had their successes. Their decisive victory in the Battle of Mookerheyde in the south east, on the Meuse embankment, on 14 April cost the lives of two of William's brothers, Louis and Henry. Requesens's armies also besieged the city of Leiden. They broke off their siege when nearby dykes were breached by the Dutch. William was content with the victory, and established the University of Leiden, the first university in the Northern Provinces.\nWilliam married for the third time on 24 April 1575 to Charlotte de Bourbon-Montpensier, a former French nun, who was also popular with the public, although less so with the Catholic faction. They had six daughters. The marriage, which seems to have been a love match on both sides, was happy.\nAfter failed peace negotiations in Breda in 1575, the war continued. The situation improved for the rebels when Don Requesens died unexpectedly in March 1576, and a large group of Spanish soldiers, not having received their salary in months, mutinied in November of that year and unleashed the \"Spanish Fury\" on Antwerp, sacking the city in what became a tremendous propaganda coup for the rebels. While the new governor, Don Juan of Austria, was en route, William of Orange got most of the provinces and cities to sign the Pacification of Ghent, in which they declared themselves ready to fight for the expulsion of Spanish troops together. However, he failed to achieve unity in matters of religion. Catholic cities and provinces would not allow freedom for Calvinists.\nWhen Don Juan signed the Perpetual Edict in February 1577, promising to comply with the conditions of the Pacification of Ghent, it seemed that the war had been decided in favour of the rebels. However, after Don Juan took the city of Namur in 1577, the uprising spread throughout the entire Netherlands. Don Juan attempted to negotiate peace, but the prince intentionally let the negotiations fail. On 24 September 1577, he made his triumphal entry into Brussels, the capital. At the same time, Calvinist rebels grew more radical, and attempted to forbid Catholicism in areas under their control. William was opposed to this both for personal and political reasons. He desired freedom of religion, and he also needed the support of the less radical Protestants and Catholics to reach his political goals. On 6 January 1579, several southern provinces, unhappy with William's radical following, signed the Treaty of Arras, in which they agreed to accept their Catholic governor, Alessandro Farnese, Duke of Parma (who had succeeded Don Juan).\nFive northern provinces, later followed by most cities in Brabant and Flanders, then signed the Union of Utrecht on 23 January, confirming their unity. William was initially opposed to the Union, as he still hoped to unite all provinces. Nevertheless, he formally gave his support on 3 May. The Union of Utrecht would later become a \"de facto\" constitution, and would remain the only formal connection between the Dutch provinces until 1797.\nDeclaration of Independence.\nIn spite of the renewed union, the Duke of Parma was successful in reconquering most of the southern part of the Netherlands. Because he had agreed to remove the Spanish troops from the provinces under the Treaty of Arras, and because Philip II needed them elsewhere subsequently, the Duke of Parma was unable to advance any further until the end of 1581.\nIn March 1580 Philip issued a royal ban of outlawry against the Prince of Orange, promising a reward of 25,000 crowns to any man who would succeed in killing him. William responded with his \"Apology\", a document (in fact written by Villiers) in which his course of actions was defended, the person of the Spanish king viciously attacked, and his own Protestant allegiance restated.\nIn the meantime, William and his supporters were looking for foreign support. The prince had already sought French assistance on several occasions, and this time he managed to gain the support of Francis, Duke of Anjou, brother of King Henry III of France. On 29 September 1580, the Staten Generaal (with the exception of Zeeland and Holland) signed the Treaty of Plessis-les-Tours with the Duke of Anjou. The Duke would gain the title \"Protector of the Liberty of the Netherlands\" and become the new sovereign. This, however, required that the Staten Generaal and William renounce their formal support of the King of Spain, which they had maintained officially up to that moment.\nOn 22 July 1581, the Staten Generaal declared that they no longer recognised Philip II of Spain as their ruler, in the Act of Abjuration. This formal declaration of independence enabled the Duke of Anjou to come to the aid of the resisters. He did not arrive until 10 February 1582, when he was officially welcomed by William in Flushing. On 18 March, the Spaniard Juan de J\u00e1uregui attempted to assassinate William in Antwerp. Although William suffered severe injuries, he survived thanks to the care of his wife Charlotte and his sister Mary. While William slowly recovered, Charlotte became exhausted from providing intensive care and died on 5 May. \nThe Duke of Anjou was not very popular with the Dutch people. The provinces of Zeeland and Holland refused to recognise him as their sovereign, and William was widely criticised for what was called his \"French politics\". When Anjou's French troops arrived in late 1582, William's plan seemed to pay off, as even the Duke of Parma feared that the Dutch would now gain the upper hand.\nHowever, Anjou himself was displeased with his limited powers, and secretly decided to seize Antwerp by force. The citizens, who had been warned in time, ambushed Anjou and his troops as they entered the city on 18 January 1583,\nin what is known as the \"French Fury\". Almost all of Anjou's men were killed, and he was reprimanded by both Catherine de Medici and Elizabeth I of England (whom he had courted). Anjou's position became untenable, and he subsequently left the country in June. His departure discredited William, who nevertheless maintained his support for Anjou. William stood virtually alone on this issue, and became politically isolated. Holland and Zeeland nevertheless maintained him as their stadtholder and attempted to declare him count of Holland and Zeeland, thus making him the official sovereign. \nIn the midst of all this, William married for the fourth and final time on 12 April 1583 to Louise de Coligny, a widowed French Huguenot and daughter of Gaspard de Coligny. She was to be the mother of Frederick Henry (1584\u20131647), William's fourth legitimate son. With her, \"Father William\", as he was affectionately styled, settled at the Prinsenhof at Delft, and lived like a simple Dutch burgher.\nAssassination.\nThe Burgundian Catholic Balthasar G\u00e9rard (born 1557) was a subject and supporter of Philip II, and regarded William of Orange as a traitor to the king and to the Catholic religion. In 1581, when G\u00e9rard learned that Philip II had declared William an outlaw and promised a reward of 25,000 crowns for his assassination, he decided to travel to the Netherlands to kill William. He served in the army of the governor of Luxembourg, Peter Ernst I von Mansfeld-Vorderort, for two years, hoping to get close to William when the armies met. This never happened, and G\u00e9rard left the army in 1584. He went to the Duke of Parma to present his plans, but the Duke was unimpressed. In May 1584, he presented himself to William as a French nobleman, and gave him the seal of the Count of Mansfelt. This seal would allow forgeries of the messages of Mansfelt to be made. William sent G\u00e9rard back to France to pass the seal on to his French allies.\nG\u00e9rard returned in July, having bought two wheel-lock pistols on his return journey. On 10 July, he made an appointment with William of Orange in his home in Delft, the Prinsenhof. That day, William was having dinner with his guest Rombertus van Uylenburgh. After William left the dining room and walked downstairs, van Uylenburgh heard G\u00e9rard shoot William in the chest at close range. G\u00e9rard fled immediately.\nAccording to official records, William's last words were:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Mon Dieu, ayez piti\u00e9 de mon \u00e2me; mon Dieu, ayez piti\u00e9 de ce pauvre peuple. (My God, have pity on my soul; my God, have pity on this poor people).\nG\u00e9rard was caught before he could escape Delft, and was imprisoned. He was tortured before his trial on 13 July, where he was sentenced to an execution brutal even by the standards of that time. The magistrates decreed that the right hand of G\u00e9rard should be burned off with a red-hot iron, that his flesh should be torn from his bones with pincers in six different places, that he should be quartered and disembowelled alive, that his heart should be torn from his chest and flung in his face, and that, finally, his head should be cut off.\nWilliam is sometimes claimed to be the first victim of a firearm political assassination, though James Stewart, Regent of Scotland had been killed by a sniper 13 years earlier.\nBurial and tomb.\nTraditionally, members of the Nassau family were buried in Breda, but as that city was under royal control when William died, he was buried in the New Church in Delft. The monument on his tomb was originally very modest, but it was replaced in 1623 by a new one, made by Hendrik de Keyser and his son Pieter.\nSince then, most of the members of the House of Orange-Nassau, including all Dutch monarchs, have been buried in the same church. His great-grandson William III and II, King of England, Scotland and Ireland, and Stadtholder in the Netherlands, was buried in Westminster Abbey.\nLegacy.\nSuccession and family ties.\nPhilip William, William's eldest son by his first marriage, to Anna of Egmond, succeeded him as the Prince of Orange. However, as Philip William was a hostage in Spain and had been for most of his life, his brother Maurice of Nassau was appointed Stadholder and Captain-General at the suggestion of Johan van Oldenbarneveldt, and as a counterpoise to the Earl of Leicester. Phillip William died in Brussels on 20 February 1618 and was succeeded by his half-brother Maurice, the eldest son by William's second marriage, to Anna of Saxony, who became Prince of Orange. A strong military leader, he won several victories over the Spanish. Van Oldenbarneveldt managed to sign a very favourable twelve-year armistice in 1609, although Maurice was unhappy with this. Maurice was a heavy drinker and died on 23 April 1625 from liver disease. Maurice had several sons by Margaretha van Mechelen, but he never married her. So, Frederick Henry, Maurice's half-brother (and William's youngest son from his fourth marriage, to Louise de Coligny) inherited the title of Prince of Orange. Frederick Henry continued the battle against the Spanish. Frederick Henry died on 14 March 1647 and is buried with his father William \"The Silent\" in Nieuwe Kerk, Delft. The Netherlands became formally independent after the Peace of M\u00fcnster in 1648.\nThe son of Frederick Henry, William II of Orange succeeded his father as stadtholder, as did his son, William III of Orange. The latter also became king of England, Scotland and Ireland from 1689. Although he was married to Mary II, Queen of Scotland and England for 17 years, he died childless in 1702. He appointed his cousin Johan Willem Friso (William's great-great-great-grandson) as his successor as the Prince of Orange. Because Albertine Agnes, a daughter of Frederick Henry, married William Frederik of Nassau-Dietz, the present royal house of the Netherlands is descended from William the Silent through the female line. See House of Orange for a more extensive overview. As the chief financer and political and military leader of the early years of the Dutch revolt, William is considered a national hero in the Netherlands, even though he was born in Germany, and usually spoke French.\nWilliam's descendants led the Netherlands until they were forced to flee in 1795 by the Batavian Revolution inspired by France. Eighteen years later, William Frederick, the son of the last stadholder and a cognatic descendant of William of Orange, returned to the Netherlands as \"sovereign prince.\" A year later, he was granted sovereignty over the Southern Netherlands as well, completing his family's three-century quest to unite the Low Countries. In 1815, William Frederick raised the Netherlands to a kingdom and proclaimed himself King William I. His descendants still reign over the Netherlands today as a constitutional monarchy, presently under King Willem-Alexander. All stadtholders and monarchs of the Netherlands since William the Silent are either direct descendants of him or descendants of his brother.\nMany of the Dutch national symbols can be traced back to William of Orange:\nOther remembrances of William of Orange:\nEpithet.\nThere are several explanations for the origin of the style, \"William the Silent\". The most common one relates to his prudence in regard to a conversation with Henry II, the king of France.\nOne day, during a stag-hunt in the Bois de Vincennes, Henry, finding himself alone with the Prince, began to speak of the great number of Protestant sectaries who, during the late war, had increased so much in his kingdom to his great sorrow. His conscience, said the King, would not be easy nor his realm secure until he could see it purged of the \"accursed vermin,\" who would one day overthrow his government, under the cover of religion, if they were allowed to get the upper hand. This was the more to be feared since some of the chief men in the kingdom, and even some princes of the blood, were on their side. But he hoped by the grace of God and the good understanding that he had with his new son, the King of Spain, that he would soon get the better of them. The King talked on thus to Orange in the full conviction that he was aware of the secret agreement recently made with the Duke of Alba for the extirpation of heresy. But the Prince, subtle and adroit as he was, answered the good King in such a way as to leave him still under the impression that he, the Prince, knew all about the scheme proposed by Alba; and on this understanding the King revealed all the details of the plan which had been arranged between the King of Spain and himself for the rooting out and rigorous punishment of the heretics, from the lowest to the highest rank, and in this service the Spanish troops were to be mainly employed.\nExactly when and by whom the nickname \"the Silent\" was used for the first time is not known with certainty. It is traditionally ascribed to Cardinal de Granvelle, who is said to have referred to William as \"the silent one\" sometime during the troubles of 1567. Both the nickname and the accompanying anecdote are first found in a historical source from the early 17th century.\nPersonal life.\nFirst marriage.\nIn the castle of Buren on 6 July 1551, the 18-year-old William married Anna van Egmond en Buren, aged 18 and the wealthy heiress to the lands of her father. William thus gained the titles Lord of Egmond and Count of Buren. The couple had a happy marriage and became the parents of three children together; their son Philip William would succeed William as prince. Anna died on 24 March 1558, leaving William much grieved.\nA couple of years after Anna's death, William had a brief relationship with Eva Elincx, a commoner, leading to the birth of an illegitimate son, Justinus van Nassau: William officially recognised Justinus as his son and took responsibility for his education \u2013 Justinus would become an admiral in adult life.\nSecond marriage.\nOn 25 August 1561, William of Orange married for the second time. His new wife, Anna of Saxony, was tumultuous, and it is generally assumed that William married her to gain more influence in Saxony, Hesse and the Palatinate. The couple had two sons and three daughters. One of the sons died in infancy and the other son, the famous Maurice of Nassau, who was to eventually succeed his father as stadtholder, never married. Anna died after William renounced her and her own family imprisoned her in one of their castles. The cause was due to the accusation that she committed adultery with the lawyer Jan Rubens (father of the famous painter Peter Paul Rubens), and became pregnant by him, giving birth to a daughter. Before her death William had already announced his third marriage, which drew the disapproval of her family who argued that, despite the adultery, the two were still married.\nThird marriage.\nWilliam married for the third time on 12 June 1575 to Charlotte de Bourbon-Montpensier, a former French nun, who was also popular with the public. They had six daughters. The marriage, which seems to have been a love match on both sides, was happy. Charlotte allegedly died from exhaustion while trying to nurse her husband after an assassination attempt in 1582. Though William was outwardly stoical, it was feared that his grief might cause a fatal relapse. Charlotte's death was widely mourned.\nFourth marriage.\nWilliam married for the fourth and final time on 12 April 1583 to Louise de Coligny, a French Huguenot and daughter of Gaspard de Coligny. She was to be the mother of Frederick Henry (1584\u20131647), William's fourth legitimate son and fifteenth legitimate child. This youngest of William's children, who was born only a few months before William's death, was to be the only one of his sons to bear children and carry the dynasty forward. Incidentally, Frederick Henry's only male-line grandson, William III, would become king of England, Scotland and Ireland, but he would die childless, at which point the agnatic lineage of William the Silent would end, to be succeeded by that of his brother John VI.\nIssue.\nBetween his first and second marriages, William had a common law relationship with Eva Elincx. They had a son, Justinus van Nassau (1559\u20131631), whom William acknowledged. On 4 December 1597 Justinus van Nassau married Anne, Baronesse de M\u00e9rode (9 January 1567 \u2013 Leiden, 8 October 1634). They had three children.\nCoats of arms and titles.\nA noble's power was generally based on his ownership of vast tracts of land and lucrative offices. Besides being ruler over the principality of Orange and a Knight of the Golden Fleece, William possessed other estates, mostly enfeoffed to some other sovereign, either the King of France or the imperial Habsburgs. As holder of these fiefs, he was \"inter alia\":\nWilliam used two sets of arms in his lifetime. The first one shown below was his ancestral arms of Nassau. The second arms he used most of his life from the time he became Prince of Orange on the death of his cousin Ren\u00e9 of Chalon. He placed the arms of Chalon-Arlay as princes of Orange as an inescutcheon on his father's arms. In 1582, William purchased the marquisate of Veere and Vlissingen in Zeeland. It had been the property of Philip II since 1567, but had fallen into arrears to the province. In 1580, the Court of Holland ordered it sold. William bought it as it gave him two more votes in the States of Zeeland. He owned the government of the two towns, and so could appoint their magistrates. He already had one as First Noble for Philip William, who had inherited Maartensdijk. This made William the predominant member of the States of Zeeland. It was a smaller version of the countship of Zeeland (and Holland) promised to William, and was a potent political base for his descendants. William then added the shield of Veere and Buren to his arms as shown in the third coat of arms below. It shows how arms were used to represent political power in general, and the growing political power of William.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The buildings and grounds are managed by the National Park Service to commemorate the life of Herbert Hoover, the 31st president of the United States. The park was established in 1965, shortly after it was named a National Historic Landmark. It now encompasses .\nHoover spent the first eleven years of his life in West Branch. The son of a blacksmith who practiced close to the town, Hoover was born in a small cottage in 1874. The family later moved nearby to the \"House of the Maples\", a two-story house. Within the next few years, Hoover was orphaned and left West Branch to live with relatives in Oregon. Hoover would go on to become a successful mining engineer, humanitarian, and President of the United States.\nThe birthplace cottage fell into private hands and became a tourist destination following Hoover's nomination to the presidency in 1928. After the Hoover family acquired the cottage in the 1930s, they worked to develop a park aimed at recreating Hoover's formative childhood experience. Among the buildings that now stand in the park are a blacksmith shop similar to the one owned by his father, the first West Branch schoolhouse, and the Quaker meetinghouse where the Hoover family worshiped. In the 1960s, the Herbert Hoover Presidential Library and Museum first opened to maintain Hoover's presidential papers and memorabilia. Herbert and his wife, First Lady Lou Henry Hoover, are buried under a monument designed by William Wagner. After the death of Herbert Hoover, an tallgrass prairie was developed.\nHistory.\nBirthplace and childhood home.\nHerbert Clark Hoover spent the first eleven years of his life in West Branch, Iowa, a small farming community with a population around 500. His birthplace cottage was built in the spring of 1871 at the corner of Penn and Downey Streets. The two-room cottage, built for recent settlers Jesse Clark Hoover and his wife Hulda, was only and had two rooms. Jesse and Hulda were both Quakers. Jesse was a blacksmith, and opened a shop shortly after settling. The cottage was built on a stone foundation and built with board and batten timber. The timber was cut in a sawmill in Muscatine.\nOn August 10, 1874, Herbert (known in his childhood as \"Bert\" or \"Bertie\") was born as the second child to Jesse and Hulda. Jesse's blacksmith had grown to be very successful, and in 1878, Jesse Hoover sold the practice to open a farm implement store on the corner of Main and Downey Streets. In March 1879, the family moved to the House of the Maples, a two-story frame house. Hoover may have attended classes at an 1853 schoolhouse at the corner of Main and Downey Streets. He attended Quaker services at the nearby Friends Meetinghouse.\nThe prosperity of the Hoover family suddenly ended on December 13, 1880, when Jesse died of rheumatic fever. Hulda supported the family by sewing and taking in boarders. However, Hulda died of typhoid fever on February 24, 1884. Now an orphan, nine-year-old Herbert Hoover was sent to live with his uncle Allan Hoover on a nearby farm. Two years later, Hoover was sent to Newberg, Oregon to live with another uncle.\nHoover career and presidency.\nHerbert Hoover became a prosperous mining engineer, becoming very wealthy after working in Australia and China. He married Lou Henry in 1899. During World War I, Hoover was moved by a food crisis in Europe. Hoover oversaw operations for the Commission for Relief in Belgium to feed the nation of Belgium throughout the war. After the United States entered the war, Hoover was appointed the head of the U.S. Food Administration. Hoover was lauded for his efforts in his homeland. He campaigned on behalf of Warren G. Harding in 1920, who rewarded Hoover by appointing him Secretary of Commerce in his cabinet.\nIn 1928, Hoover was considered the leading candidate for president by the Republican Party. He defeated Al Smith in a landslide. However, his term was marred by the economic downturn of the Great Depression. Despite efforts to right the economy, Hoover was himself defeated in a landslide in 1932 to Franklin D. Roosevelt. During World War II, Hoover was again tasked with providing food to war-torn countries.\nGravesite.\nHerbert Hoover died from internal bleeding in 1964, enjoying the longest retirement of any President to that point. Hoover considered his years in West Branch to be his most formative, and requested that he and his wife (who had died twenty years earlier) be buried there. Allan Hoover selected the site, which was landscaped before Herbert Hoover's death. 100,000 people lined the funeral procession route between Cedar Rapids and West Branch. William Wagner designed the memorial in collaboration with surviving Hoover family members. Standing at the foot of the monument, one can see the birthplace cottage.\nHistoric development.\nR. Portland and Jennie Scellers purchased the cottage in 1889. They moved it to the rear of the property and turned it so that it faced south. They then built a two-story house and connected it to the cottage. In 1928, when Hoover was nominated as president, tourists began to come to West Branch to see the birthplace of the candidate. The widowed Jennie Scellers opened the cottage to the public. Charging ten cents a tour, she entertained over 17,000 visitors in the first year alone. Enjoying the profitability of the building, Scellers refused to sell the property to the Hoover family, but upon her death in 1934, the house was sold to Hoover's son Allan. He demolished the two-story house and turned the cottage back to its original orientation (facing east).\nHoover and his family believed that, by recreating the surroundings of his early life, visitors could be inspired by the experience. After Allan purchased the cottage in 1935, the Hoovers began work on developing the environment. By 1938, the cottage had been restored by the Hoover Birthplace Committee, a group founded to support Hoover's 1928 campaign stop in West Branch. Lou Henry was the \"de facto\" leader of the group until her death in 1944. She oversaw all of the early developments, including the relocation of the \"Isis\" statue and the acquisition of land around the birthplace. She also developed a retaining wall for Hoover Creek and had a footpath built over it to connect the cottage with \"Isis\". She installed trees, shrubs, and flowers from a Marion garden. Allan Hoover took over the project following his mother's death.\nThe birthplace park hosted the first Hoover Day celebration of Hoover's 74th birthday in 1948. The large crowds that came to celebrate the Iowan inspired Allan Hoover to further develop the site in time for his father's 80th birthday in 1954. The Herbert Hoover Birthplace Park was officially dedicated on June 30, 1952. The following year, a comfort station and picnic shelter were constructed; these have both since been demolished. In collaboration with the Hoover celebration in 1954, the Boy Scouts of America built another picnic shelter and dedicated a bronze plaque to the former president. In 1957, the Hoover family decided to recreate the Jesse Hoover blacksmith shop, which was rebuilt using wood reclaimed from an 1870 barn. The blacksmith shop is a working shop producing various iron items for sale and replacement period hardware for the NPS.\nIn the late 1950s, the park was greatly expanded in response to the proposed Interstate 80, which would pass just south of the park. These land acquisitions maintained the integrity of the site. The Birthplace Society moved a 1905 house to the park in 1964 to serve as the house of the Director of the Presidential Library. The house has since been transferred to the Herbert Hoover Presidential Library Association, who use it as offices. Around the same time, the Birthplace Society moved the Quaker Meetinghouse to the site. Although the Hoovers were originally opposed to the idea, since the church was originally far from the house, they relented when learning of a demolition threat. It was the last building moved to the site before Hoover's death.\nNational Historic Site.\nAs the Herbert Hoover Birthplace, the site was declared a National Historic Landmark on June 23, 1965. The National Historic Site was established on August 12, 1965. When the National Register of Historic Places was created a year later, the site was automatically listed. The complex originally included twenty-eight buildings, fourteen sites, eight structures, and eight objects over . In 2013, the site was redefined to include thirteen buildings, one site, two structures, and one object over .\nThe National Historic Site features West Branch several buildings that would have been standing during Hoover's childhood there. The 1853 schoolhouse was moved to the site near its original location. Likewise, the Friends Meetinghouse where Hoover worshiped has been moved to the site. Jesse Hoover's blacksmith shop has been rebuilt. These four buildings are open for free touring. The gravesite overlooking the cottage can also be visited. Near the gravesite is a tallgrass prairie, designed to resemble the type of landscape that early West Branch settlers would have witnessed. The prairie was named a National Recreation Trail in 1981.\nThe large statue of the Egyptian deity Isis was presented to Hoover as a gift from the people of Belgium, in gratitude for his famine relief efforts on behalf of their country during the war. Sculpted by Belgian native Auguste Puttemans, the statue originally decorated Hoover's home in Palo Alto, California. The Hoovers brought it to West Branch in 1939, located \"contemplating the house\" where Hoover was born.\nThe site also includes historic houses on Downey and Poplar Streets that belonged to significant West Branch residents. These houses are not open to the public. Some of the historic house are used for park operations and storage, while others have been available as housing for park staff. In 2021 the NPS posted an RFEI for adaptive use of the Staples, Wright, and Hayhurst houses.\nIn 2020, the park service embarked on a multi-year flood mitigation project for Hoover creek, a tributary of the West Branch Wapsinonoc creek which runs through the site. The project involved widening the existing creek channel, replacement of bridges, and the construction of a 10-acre retention basin in the park's tallgrass prairie.\nDowney Street.\nLaban Miles was the brother-in-law of Hulda Hoover. The Miles and Hoover families became close friends, and Herbert would play with the Miles children. Laban Miles later served Rutherford B. Hayes as an Indian agent. Hoover briefly lived with the Miles family in 1882 on the Osage Nation reservation while permanent plans were being made for his rearing. A farmstead owned by the Miles family south of the residential district is also part of the park. Also on Downey Street is the Amanda Garvin House, a fine example of Gothic Revival architecture. The Charles E. Smith House was moved to the site in 1969. Smith built his house in 1903, after Hoover had already left West Branch. However, the National Park Service decided to move the house to the site because of its Queen Anne architecture. His sister was the wife of Dr. L. J. Leech, who also lived on the street. Leech lived in Miles' house after moving to West Branch in 1884. While the Miles family foreclosed on their house, Leech purchased it and lived there. He built his own house next door in 1920.\nHannah Varney built her house in 1899 after her divorce from her husband. She lived there for a year before moving to Iowa City and remarried. Her daughters Cora and Clara lived in the house until 1915. The house was moved to its present site in 1967. The P. T. Smith House was the only West Branch house that Hoover distinctly remembered when visiting the town years later. The Hoover children and the Smith children often played together, particularly enjoying sledding on nearby Cook's Hill.\nPoplar Street.\nFour houses are maintained on Poplar Street. The Wright family built a house there in 1873. Like Jesse Hoover, Billy Wright was a blacksmith. E. S. Hayhurst built a house in 1872, but foreclosed on it in 1878. Real estate developer John Wetherell and his wife built a house in 1872 and sold it four years later to the retired Dr. John Staples. David Mackey purchased a house in 1869. Mackey was a carpenter and built the house himself. Shortly after completion, he died, leaving the house to his wife, son, and sister. The widower was elected mayor of West Branch in 1879. Of all the houses on the two streets, the Mackey and Wright Houses have been the least altered since their construction.\nPresidential library and museum.\nIn 1939, Franklin D. Roosevelt established the first Presidential library, a collection of his presidential papers. He donated land and memorabilia to the government and built the structure with private funds. The recently developed National Archives and Records Administration was tasked with its oversight. President Truman followed suit in 1945, announcing that he intended to build a similar library. In response, the United States Congress passed the Presidential Libraries Act of 1955, establishing a system of Presidential libraries.\nHoover originally intended to simply donate his papers to his \"alma mater\", Stanford University, and set up a small museum of memorabilia in West Branch. However, as the relationship between him and Stanford soured in the 1950s, Hoover decided to erect a presidential library and museum. The Herbert Hoover Presidential Library and Museum was the fourth such institution, opening on Hoover's 88th birthday, August 10, 1962. It is one of three libraries in the system that include the birthplace or boyhood home and gravesite of the President.\nThe opening ceremony was dedicated by Harry Truman and Hoover gave a speech. The library and museum was rededicated by President Ronald Reagan following a massive expansion in 1992. The museum is the only part of the National Historic Site that requires an entrance fee ($10 for adults).\nIn popular culture.\nGrant Wood depicted the Herbert Hoover Birthplace in his 1931 piece, \"The Birthplace of Herbert Hoover, West Branch, Iowa\". The painting was produced before the demolition of the Portland Scellers extension and relocation of the original cottage, so the face of the birthplace itself is obscured at the rear of the building in the center.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The park's visitor center is located in Harpers Ferry, Iowa, just north of Marquette.\nIn 2017, the Effigy Mounds were featured in the America the Beautiful Quarters Program.\nMounds.\nPrehistoric earthworks by mound builder cultures are common in the Midwest. However, mounds in the shape of mammals, birds, or reptiles, known as effigies, apparently were constructed primarily by peoples in what is now known as southern Wisconsin, northeast Iowa, and small parts of Minnesota and Illinois. An exception is the Great Serpent Mound in southwestern Ohio.\nEffigy Mounds National Monument takes in the western edge of the effigy region. The North Unit (67 mounds) and South Unit (29 mounds) are located where the counties meet along the Mississippi River. They are contiguous and easily accessible. The Sny Magill Unit (112 mounds) is approximately south of the other units, and offers no visitor facilities. Other mounds are located on remote parts of the Monument property. The monument contains with 206 mounds, of which 31 are effigies. The largest, Great Bear Mound, measures 42 meters from head to tail and rises over a meter above the original ground level.\nIn northeastern Iowa, the Effigy Mounds area was a point of transition between the eastern hardwood forests and the central prairies. Native Americans and early settlers would have been able to draw on natural resources available in forests, wetlands, and prairies. These areas were occupied by humans for many centuries.\nEffigy Mounds is adjacent to the Upper Mississippi River National Wildlife and Fish Refuge, the Driftless Area National Wildlife Refuge, the Yellow River State Forest, and a short distance to the south, Pikes Peak State Park. There are also a number of state-owned wildlife management areas, such as the one at Sny Magill Creek, where Clayton County also maintains a county park.\nTribes associated with the monument.\nNumerous federally recognized tribes have linguistic and cultural ties to the ancestral peoples who built the effigy and other earthwork mounds at the monument site. The National Park Service recognizes a cultural association between the monument and the following present nations:\nPublic access.\nThe visitor center, located at the park entrance, contains museum exhibits highlighting archaeological and natural specimens, an auditorium, and book sales outlet. The park has 14 miles of hiking trails. No paved public automobile access roads exist in the park. Rangers give guided hikes and prehistoric tool demonstrations that are scheduled and advertised, mid-June through Labor Day weekend. Educational programs are presented on- and off-site by appointment.\nNatural features in the monument include forests, tallgrass prairies, wetlands and rivers. There are no lodging or camping facilities in the park. Camping is available at nearby Pikes Peak State Park and Yellow River State Forest in Iowa; there is also Wyalusing State Park in Wisconsin. Various primitive campgrounds exist in the area as well. The national monument is quite close to the town of Marquette, Iowa, and is just across the Mississippi River from the city of Prairie du Chien, Wisconsin, where ample motel and gambling-boat facilities exist.\nEffigy Mounds was proclaimed a National Monument on October 25, 1949. Charles R. Keyes, head of the Iowa Archaeological Survey, and Ellison Orr, chief field supervisor for the Iowa Archaeological Survey, worked to survey and map the area, and to establish its significance for preservation.\nDriftless Area.\nThe Effigy Mounds National Monument is noted for being in the Driftless Area, an area of North America which escaped glaciation during the last ice age. The adjacent Driftless Area National Wildlife Refuge takes its name from this region.\nThe Park Service writes:\nPatchy remnants of Pre-Illinoian glacial drift more than 500,000 years old recently have been discovered in the area. Unlike the rest of Iowa, the Paleozoic Plateau was bypassed by the last of the Pleistocene glaciers (the Wisconsin), allowing the region's fast cutting streams to expose and carve out deep channels in the bedrock-dominated terrain. The area is characterized by thin loess soil cover, isolated patches of glacial drift, deeply entrenched river valleys, and karst (sinkholes, caves, and springs) topography.\nConservation issues.\nFrom 1999 to 2009, Superintendent Phyllis Ewing \"oversaw more than $3 million in illegal construction of boardwalks, trails and other structures that damaged irreplaceable archaeological artifacts.\" She failed to conduct consultation with affiliated American Indian tribes and follow procedures of the National Historic Preservation Act and other statutes. The Park Service conducted an internal investigation, finding numerous violations but no intent to damage the park.\nIn July 2016, Thomas Munson, Superintendent for 20 years of the Effigy Mounds National Monument, was sentenced to several days in prison after pleading guilty to stealing bones in 1990 of 40 ancient Native Americans, who lived between 700 and 2,500 years ago, from the holdings of the museum at the site. The remains had been excavated along with artifacts from burial mounds at the park. Munson was apparently trying to evade the proposed provisions of the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA), which was passed by Congress that year. The act provides for artifacts and bones to be returned or repatriated by governmental agencies and other institutions to tribes who are affiliated with the peoples who buried the items.\nTracing the bones could have demonstrated a link to the affiliated tribes and required return of both the remains and related artifacts from grave goods. Without that evidence, most of the artifacts have been retained by the park museum. The government conducted a five-year investigation through the US Attorney's Office, following questions raised in 2011 by Iowa Tribe of Kansas and Nebraska member Patt Murphy. As tribal representative under NAGPRA to receive \"remains and funerary objects for repatriation and reburial,\" he had requested an inventory from the national monument of all remains and goods, which they could not provide. This began the inquiry. Murphy has praised the work of the US Attorney's Office and others in this case.\nMunson was sentenced to a year of home detention, 10 weekends in jail, and paying \"$108,905 in restitution for the damage he caused to the bones and a $3,000 fine.\" Munson had retired from the National Park Service in 1994.\nJim Nepstad, who was appointed superintendent at the monument in 2011, worked to restore those disturbed areas of the park. He also worked to rebuild the Park Service's standing with area residents and members of the site's affiliated American Indian tribes. He was featured in the documentary .\nIn 2022, archaeologist Susa Snow was appointed superintendent of the monument. https:// That same year, the National Park Service and leaders of the Iowa Tribe of Kansas and Nebraska (ITKN) signed a first-of-its-kind agreement establishing the first Tribal Sister Park relationship between a U.S. national park and a Tribal Nation\u2019s National Park. https://\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He was the Stadtholder of Friesland and Groningen in the Dutch Republic. He also served in the Dutch States Army during the War of the Spanish Succession until his death by accidental drowning in the Hollands Diep in 1711. \nBackground.\nBorn on 14 August 1687 in Dessau, Anhalt, John William Friso was the son of Henry Casimir II, Prince of Nassau-Dietz, and Princess Henri\u00ebtte Amalia of Anhalt-Dessau who were both first cousins of William III. He was also a member of the House of Nassau (the branch of Nassau-Dietz), and through the testamentary dispositions of William III became the progenitor of the new line of the House of Orange-Nassau. He was educated under Jean Lemonon, professor at the University of Franeker.\nSuccession.\nWith the death of William III of Orange, the legitimate male line of William the Silent (the second House of Orange) became extinct. John William Friso, the senior agnatic descendant of William the Silent's brother and a cognatic descendant of Frederick Henry, grandfather of William III, claimed the succession as stadtholder in all provinces held by William III. This was denied to him by the republican faction in the Netherlands. \nThe five provinces over which William III ruled \u2013 Holland, Zeeland, Utrecht, Gelderland and Overijssel \u2013 all suspended the office of stadtholder after William III's death. The remaining two provinces \u2013 Friesland and Groningen \u2013 were never governed by William III, and continued to retain a separate stadtholder, John William Friso. He established the third House of Orange, which became extinct in the male line in 1890. His son, William IV of Orange, later became stadtholder of all seven provinces.\nUnder William III's will, Friso stood to inherit the Principality of Orange, but due to the outbreak of the War of the Spanish Succession, Johan Willem Friso was unable to assert his claims to the principality and other possessions of William III. His inheritance was contested by his cousin, Frederick I of Prussia, as well as by his Catholic relative from Nassau-Siegen and various descendants of the old House of Chalon in France. Additionally, King Louis XIV sought to take control of the principality, which had long been a Protestant enclave. He temporarily supported the claims of the Prince of Conti, who was recognized by the French council as the rightful heir. The Protestant population was expelled, and the Principality of Orange remained in French hands following the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713, with the Prince of Conti acknowledging Louis XIV's sovereignty. The inheritance of William III and the title \"Prince of Orange\" became the subject of a serious dispute between the Frisian branch of the House of Nassau and the Prussian royal family, a conflict that remained unresolved at the time of Johan Willem Friso's death in 1711.\nMilitary career.\nAppointment and first military actions.\nIn 1702 at the start of the War of the Spanish Succession, John William Friso intended to participate in his first military campaign with the Dutch States Army under the supervision of his governor, Van Heemstra, but was prevented by a fall from his horse. He eventually joined the war effort in 1703, serving under Field Marshal Hendrik van Nassau, Lord of Ouwerkerk. In 1704, after intense debate among the Dutch provinces, he was designated the position of General of Infantry. Although only nominally, as he was just 17 years old. Efforts to appoint him as a member of the Council of State in 1705 were blocked by Holland and Utrecht, and later, in 1707, by Zeeland and Overijssel.\nWhen John William Friso came of age in 1707, he formally assumed his titles in the northern provinces, though in Groningen this did not occur until 1708 and was subject to restrictions. He quickly earned distinction as a general. Although he had previously been present at several engagements without holding an official command\u2014such as the siege of Ostend and the siege of Menin\u2014his first significant action as an active participant was at the Battle of Oudenaarde. At Oudenaarde he led the flank attack of 10,000 Dutch infantrymen that would decide the battle in favour of the Allies, for which he would receive much praise in and outside the Republic. \nFollowing that battle he joined Eugene of Savoy in his siege of Lille and was in overal command of the Anglo-Dutch troops at the siege. He positioned his headquarters in the village of Lamberfart, dangerously close to the city's cannons. On August 18, a cannonball struck his quarters while he was getting dressed. The shot narrowly missed him, passing just inches from his face, but killed his chamberlain, Du Cerceau, who was standing nearby. Blood and brain matter splattered across the room, but the prince remained remarkably composed, showing more concern for the loss of his loyal servant than for his own close brush with death. Following this incident, senior officials urged him to relocate his headquarters, and he eventually moved to the safer Castle of Holbeek. Lille fell after several bloody months and the campaign was concluded with the siege of Gent and capture of Brugge in which the Prince of Orange also played his part.\nIn June of 1709, as the allies marched on Tournai Friso was tasked with capturing Mortange and Saint-Amand, to safeguard the siege operations against French attacks from the side of Valenciennes. The primary objective was Fort l'Escarpe, which controlled the crossing of the Scheldt. Friso was fortunate when, after about a dozen shots from his accompanying field guns, the drawbridge unexpectedly fell without being destroyed. Taking advantage of this, his troops swiftly stormed the fort, met little resistance, and captured the garrison.\nBattle of Malplaquet.\nFollowing the capture of Tournai on 3 September the French and Allied armies met at the Battle of Malplaquet. Here he commanded the infantry on the Allied left together with Fran\u00e7ois Nicolas Fagel. Overall control was exercised by Count Tilly, who had succeeded Ouwerkerk as senior Dutch commander. In reality, Tilly's anti-Orangist sympathies meant his largely pro-Orangist senior officers allegedly took their orders from John William Friso. \nThe Duke of Marlborough, the Allied commander in overal control, tasked the 30 Dutch infantry battalions Dutch on left with attacking the French rightwing. This was a hopeless task. The French right wing, commanded by the seasoned military leader Louis-Fran\u00e7ois de Boufflers, was shielded by a forest and a strong line of entrenchments. Additionally, Boufflers commanded twice as many troops as the prince. His forces included the \"r\u00e9giment de Picardie\" and the French and Swiss Guards, some of the best infantry regiments of the French army. The Dutch initially expected to be reinforced by 21 battalions under Henry Withers, which were still advancing from Tournai. However, with the plans having changed, the left flank's forces were now insufficient to execute the operation successfully.\nHalf an hour after the Allied right wing had engaged the enemy, John William Friso ordered his troops to join the fray. His Dutch forces, which included Scottish and Swiss regiments, were the finest in Europe. They launched three determined assaults on the French positions, but despite their tenacity and the ground they managed to seize, they were repelled each time with heavy casualties. Many Dutch infantry officers lost their lives or were severely wounded during the battle, but the prince, remarkably, remained completely unharmed. Throughout the brutal combat, he fought courageously, and had his horse shot out from under him twice. At one point, John William Friso even seized a banner from the Swiss Mey Regiment, planted it on a redoubt, and cried out to his troops: 'Follow me, my friends, here is your post!'\nIt was only when Frederik Sirtema van Grovestins and his cavalry approached the French fortifications from behind, and the French retreated, that John William Friso was able to capture them. The Dutch forces paid a heavy price at Malplaquet, suffering around 10,000 dead and wounded. Yet John William Friso's assaults were not in vain. These fierce attacks made it impossible for Boufflers to reinforce the vulnerable French center, where the Allies ultimately broke through. Nonetheless, he faced significant criticism from the Republic where he was blamed for youthful recklessness and the unnecessary sacrifice of lives. Some British historians, notably Winston Churchill, have later suggested that he turned a feigned attack into a real one in pursuit of glory. However, there is no evidence for this claim. The Dutch had been ordered to drive the enemy from their positions and advance onto the Malplaquet plateau\u2014orders consistent with Marlborough's usual strategy of mounting multiple attacks to unbalance the enemy, and Marlborough never blamed the prince for the heavy Dutch losses. Instead, it seems more likely that both he and Orange had underestimated the strength and resilience of the French defence.\nLast military actions and death.\nAfter Malplaquet the Allies marched on Mons and John William Friso was tasked with leading all operations at the siege. In 1710 he led the Siege of Douai together with the Prince of Anhalt-Dessau. Dessau commanded the right, while Orange led the left. During the siege, the left side made significantly more progress than the right. Years later, Hertel, the Dutch engineer who had served under Dessau, confessed to Vegelin van Claerbergen that he had sabotaged the right-wing's efforts, as the Prince of Orange had requested him\u2014privately\u2014that the progress be delayed there. Later that year he managed to capture Saint Vernant. The prestige that he acquired from his military service should have favored his eventual elevation as stadtholder in the remaining five provinces. However, in 1711, when traveling from the front in Flanders to meet the King of Prussia in The Hague in connection with his suit in the succession dispute, he drowned on 14 July when the ferry boat on the Moerdyk was overturned in heavy weather. His son was born six weeks after his death.\nMarriage and issue.\nOn 26 April 1709, John William Friso married Princess Maria Louise of Hesse-Kassel (1688\u20131765), daughter of Charles I, Landgrave of Hesse-Kassel, and granddaughter of Jacob Kettler, Duke of Courland. They had two children.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Sonority is loosely defined as the loudness of speech sounds relative to other sounds of the same pitch, length and stress, therefore sonority is often related to rankings for phones to their amplitude. For example, pronouncing the fricative [v] will produce a louder sound than the stop [b], so [v] would rank higher in the hierarchy. However, grounding sonority in amplitude is not universally accepted. Instead, many researchers refer to sonority as the resonance of speech sounds. This relates to the degree to which production of phones results in vibrations of air particles. Thus, sounds that are described as more sonorous are less subject to masking by ambient noises.\nSonority hierarchies are especially important when analyzing syllable structure; rules about what segments may appear in onsets or codas together, such as SSP, are formulated in terms of the difference of their sonority values. Some languages also have assimilation rules based on sonority hierarchy, for example, the Finnish potential mood, in which a less sonorous segment changes to copy a more sonorous adjacent segment (e.g. \"-tne- \u2192 -nne-\").\nSonority hierarchy.\nSonority hierarchies vary somewhat in which sounds are grouped together. The one below is fairly typical:\nSound types are the most sonorous on the left side of the scale, and become progressively less sonorous towards the right (e.g., fricatives are less sonorous than nasals).\nThe labels on the left refer to distinctive features, and categories of sounds can be grouped together according to whether they share a feature. For instance, as shown in the sonority hierarchy above, vowels are considered [+syllabic], whereas all consonants (including glides, liquids, nasals, etc.) are considered [\u2212syllabic]. All sound categories falling under [+sonorant] are sonorants, whereas those falling under [\u2212sonorant] are obstruents. In this way, any contiguous set of sound types may be grouped together on the basis of no more than two features (for instance, affricates and fricatives are [\u2212sonorant, +delayed release]).\nSonority scale.\nIn English, the sonority scale, from highest to lowest, is the following:\nIn simpler terms, the scale has members of the same group hold the same sonority from the greatest to the smallest presence of vibrations in the vocal folds. Vowels have the most vibrations, but consonants are characterized as such in part by the lack of vibrations or a break in vibrations. The top of the scale, open vowels, has the most air used for vibrations, and the bottom of the scale has the least air being used for vibrations. That can be demonstrated by putting a few fingers on one's throat and pronouncing an open vowel such as the vowel [a], and then pronouncing one of the plosives (also known as stop consonants) of the [p t k] class. For vowels, there is a consistent level pressure generated from the lungs and diaphragm, and the difference in pressure in one's body and outside the mouth is minimal. For plosive, the pressure generated from the lungs and diaphragm changes significantly, and the difference in pressure in one's body and outside the mouth is maximal before release (no air is flowing, and the vocal folds are not resisting the air flow).\nMore finely-nuanced hierarchies often exist within classes whose members cannot be said to be distinguished by relative sonority. In North American English, for example, the set /p t k/ has /t/ being by far the most subject to weakening when before an unstressed vowel (the usual American pronunciation has /t/ as a flap in \"later\" but normally no weakening of /p/ in \"caper\" or of /k/ in \"faker\").\nIn Portuguese, intervocalic /n/ and /l/ are typically lost historically (e.g. Lat. LUNA &gt; /lua/ 'moon', DONARE &gt; /doar/ 'donate', COLORE &gt; /kor/ 'color'), but /r/ remains (CERA &gt; /sera/ 'wax'), but Romanian has transformed the intervocalic non-geminate /l/ into /r/ (SOLEM &gt; /so\u032fare/ 'sun') and reduced the geminate /ll/ to /l/ (OLLA &gt; /o\u032fal\u0259/ 'pot'). It has, however, left /n/ (LUNA &gt; /lun\u0259/ 'moon') and /r/ (PIRA &gt; /par\u0259/ 'pear') unchanged. Similarly, Romance languages often have geminate /mm/ weaker than /nn/, and geminate /rr/ is often stronger than other geminates, including /pp tt kk/. In such cases, many phonologists refer not to sonority but to a more abstract notion of relative strength. The latter was once posited as universal in its arrangement, but it is now known to be language-specific.\nSonority in phonotactics.\nSyllable structure tends to be highly influenced and motivated by the sonority scale, with the general rule that more sonorous elements are internal (i.e., close to the syllable nucleus) and less sonorant elements are external. For instance, the sequence /plant/ is permissible in many languages, while /lpatn/ is much less likely (this is the sonority sequencing principle). This rule is applied with varying levels of strictness cross-linguistically, with many languages allowing exceptions: for example, in English, /s/ can be found external to stops even though it is more sonorous (e.g. \"strong\", \"hats\").\nIn many languages the presence of two non-adjacent highly-sonorous elements can be a reliable indication of how many syllables are in the word; /ata/ is most likely two syllables, and many languages would deal with the sequences like /mbe/ or /lpatn/ by pronouncing them as multiple syllables, with syllabic sonorants: [m\u0329.be] and [l\u0329.pat.n\u0329].\nEcological patterns in sonority.\nThe sonority ranking of speech sounds plays an important role in developing phonological patterns in language, which allows for the intelligible transmission of speech between individuals in a society. Differences in the occurrence of particular sounds in languages around the world have been observed by numerous researchers. It has been suggested that these differences are as a result of ecological pressures.\nThis understanding was developed from the acoustic adaptation hypothesis, which was a theory initially used to understand differences in bird songs across varying habitats. However, the theory has been applied by researchers as a base for understanding why differences are shown in speech sounds within spoken languages around the world.\nClimates.\nMaddieson and Coup\u00e9's study on 633 languages worldwide observed that some of the variation in the sonority of speech sounds in languages can be accounted for by differences in climate. The pattern follows that in warmer climatic zones, language is more sonorous compared to languages in cooler climatic zones which favour the use of consonants. To explain these differences they emphasise the influence of atmospheric absorption and turbulence within warmer, ambient air, which may disrupt the integrity of acoustic signals. Therefore, employing more sonorous sounds in a language may reduce the distortion of soundwaves in warmer climates. \nFought and Munroe instead argue that these disparities in speech sounds are as a result of differences in the daily activities of individuals in different climates. Proposing that throughout history individuals residing in warmer climates tend to spend more time outdoors (likely engaging in agricultural work or social activities), therefore speech requires effective propagation of sound through the air for acoustic signals to meet the recipient over these long distances, unlike in cooler climates where people are communicating over shorter distances (spend more time indoors).\nAnother explanation is that languages have adapted to maintain homeostasis. Thermoregulation aims to ensure body temperature remains within a certain range of values, allowing for the proper functioning of cells. Therefore, it has been argued that differences in the regularity of phones in a language are an adaptation which helps to regulate internal bodily temperatures. Employing the use of open vowels like /a/ which is highly sonorous, requires the opening of vocal articulators. This allows for air to flow out of the mouth and with it evaporating water which reduces internal bodily temperatures. In contrast, voiceless plosives like /t/ are more common in cooler climates. Producing this speech sound obstructs airflow out of the mouth due to the constriction of vocal articulators. Thus, reducing the transfer of heat out of the body, which is important for individuals residing in cooler climates.\nVegetation.\nA positive correlation exists, so that as temperature increases, so does the use of more sonorous speech sounds. However, the presence of dense vegetation coverage leads to the correlation occurring oppositely, so that less sonorous speech sounds are favoured by warmer climates when the area is covered by dense vegetation. This is said to be because in warmer climates with dense vegetation coverage individuals instead communicate over shorter distances, therefore favour speech sounds which are ranked lower in the sonority hierarchy.\nAltitude.\nEverett, (2013) suggested that in high elevation regions such as in the Andes, languages regularly employ the use of ejective plosives like /k\u02bc/. Everett argued that in high altitude areas, with reduced ambient air pressure, the use of ejectives allows for ease of articulation when producing speech. Moreover, as no air is flowing out of the vocal folds, water is conserved whilst communicating, thus reducing dehydration in individuals residing in high elevation regions.\nA range of other additional factors have also been observed which affect the degree of sonority of a particular language such as precipitation and sexual restrictiveness. Inevitably, the patterns become more complex when considering a range of ecological factors simultaneously. Moreover, large amounts of variation are shown which may be due to patterns of migration.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Like \"Miss\" and \"Mrs.\", the term \"Ms.\" has its origins in the female English title once used for all women, \"Mistress\". It originated in the 17th century and was revived into mainstream usage in the 20th century.\nIt is followed by a full stop, or period, in Canada and the United States, but not in many other English-speaking countries.\nHistorical development and revival of the term.\nMiss and Mrs., are both derived from the then formal Mistress, like Mister did not originally indicate marital status. Ms. was another acceptable, but rarely used, abbreviation for Mistress in England in the 17th and 18th centuries. During the 19th century, however, Mrs. and Miss came to be associated almost exclusively with marital status. Ms. was popularized as an alternative in the late 20th century.\nThe earliest known proposal for the modern revival of Ms. as a title appeared in \"The Republican\" of Springfield, Massachusetts, on November 10, 1901:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;There is a void in the English language which, with some diffidence, we undertake to fill. Every one has been put in an embarrassing position by ignorance of the status of some woman. To call a maiden Mrs is only a shade worse than to insult a matron with the inferior title Miss. Yet it is not always easy to know the facts...\nNow, clearly, what is needed is a more comprehensive term which does homage to the sex without expressing any views as to their domestic situation, and what could be simpler or more logical than the retention of what the two doubtful terms have in common. The abbreviation Ms is simple, it is easy to write, and the person concerned can translate it properly according to circumstances. For oral use it might be rendered as \"Mizz,\" which would be a close parallel to the practice long universal in many bucolic regions, where a slurred Mis' does duty for Miss and Mrs alike.\nThe term was again suggested as a convenience to writers of business letters by such publications as the \"Bulletin of the American Business Writing Association\" (1951) and \"The Simplified Letter\", issued by the National Office Management Association (1952).\nIn 1961, Sheila Michaels attempted to put the term into use when she saw what she thought was a typographical error on the address label of a copy of \"News &amp; Letters\" sent to her roommate. Michaels \"was looking for a title for a woman who did not 'belong' to a man.\" She knew the separation of the now common terms \"Miss\" and \"Mrs.\" had derived from \"Mistress\", but one could not suggest that women use the original title with its now louche connotations. Her efforts to promote use of a new honorific were at first ignored.\nIn 1969, during a lull in an interview with \"The Feminists\" group on WBAI-FM radio in New York City, Michaels suggested the use of \"Ms.\" A friend of Gloria Steinem heard the interview and suggested it as a title for her new magazine. The magazine \"Ms.\" debuted on newsstands in January 1972, and its much-publicized name quickly led to widespread usage. In February 1972, the US Government Printing Office approved using \"Ms.\" in official government documents. In 1976, Marvel Comics introduced a new superhero named Ms. Marvel, billing her as the \"first feminist superhero.\"\nEven several public opponents of such usage, including William Safire, were finally convinced that \"Ms.\" had earned a place in English by the case of US Congresswoman Geraldine Ferraro. Ferraro, a United States vice-presidential candidate in 1984, was a married woman who used her birth surname professionally rather than her husband's (Zaccaro). Safire, though saying \"it breaks my heart,\" admitted in 1984 that it would be equally incorrect to call her \"Miss Ferraro\" (as she was married) or \"Mrs. Ferraro\" (as her husband was not \"Mr. Ferraro\")\u2014and that calling her \"Mrs. Zaccaro\" would confuse the reader.\nUsage.\nSuggestions about how \"Ms.\" should be used, or whether it should be used at all, are varied, with more criticism in the U.K. than in the U.S.\n\"The Daily Telegraph\" states in its style guide that \"Ms\" should only be used if a subject requests it herself and it \"should not be used merely because we do not know whether the woman is Mrs or Miss.\" \"The Guardian\", which restricts its use of honorific titles to leading articles, states in its style guide: \"use Ms for women ... unless they have expressed a preference for Miss or Mrs.\" A BBC Academy style guide states, \"In choosing between Miss, Mrs and Ms, try to find out what the person herself uses, and stick to that.\" \"The New York Times\" embraces the use of all three: Mrs., Miss, and Ms., and will follow the individual\u2019s preferences.\nSome British etiquette writers and famous figures do not support the use of \"Ms\", including Charles Kidd, the editor of Debrett's Peerage and Baronetage, who claims the usage is \"not very helpful\" and that he had been \"brought up to address a married woman as Mrs John Smith, for example.\" Debrett's itself, concerning the case of a married woman who chooses not to take her husband's name, states, \"The ugly-sounding Ms is problematic. Although many women have assumed this bland epithet, it remains incorrect to use it when addressing a social letter.\" The former British Conservative Party Member of Parliament (MP) Ann Widdecombe has stated, \"I can't see the point of Ms and I don't see it as an issue\", whilst author and journalist Jessica Fellowes describes the title Ms as \"ghastly.\" The Queen's English Society has criticised the use of Ms as \"an abbreviation that is not short for anything\", describing it as a \"linguistic misfit [that] came about because certain women suddenly became sensitive about revealing their marital status.\"\nThe default use of \"Ms.\", especially for business purposes, is championed by some American sources, including Judith Martin (\"a.k.a.\" Miss Manners). Concerning business, the Emily Post Institute states, \"Ms. is the default form of address, unless you know positively that a woman wishes to be addressed as Mrs.\" \"The American Heritage Book of English Usage\" states, \"Using Ms. obviates the need for the guesswork involved in figuring out whether to address someone as Mrs. or Miss: you can't go wrong with Ms. Whether the woman you are addressing is married or unmarried, has changed her name or not, Ms. is always correct.\"\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "74361", "revid": "23939382", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=74361", "title": "Binary symmetric channel", "text": "Common communications channel model\nA binary symmetric channel (or BSCp) is a common communications channel model used in coding theory and information theory. In this model, a transmitter wishes to send a bit (a zero or a one), and the receiver will receive a bit. The bit will be \"flipped\" with a \"crossover probability\" of \"p\", and otherwise is received correctly. This model can be applied to varied communication channels such as telephone lines or disk drive storage.\nThe noisy-channel coding theorem applies to BSCp, saying that information can be transmitted at any rate up to the channel capacity with arbitrarily low error. The channel capacity is formula_1 bits, where formula_2 is the binary entropy function. Codes including Forney's code have been designed to transmit information efficiently across the channel.\nDefinition.\nA binary symmetric channel with crossover probability formula_3, denoted by BSCp, is a channel with binary input and binary output and probability of error formula_3. That is, if formula_5 is the transmitted random variable and formula_6 the received variable, then the channel is characterized by the conditional probabilities:\nformula_7\nIt is assumed that formula_8. If formula_9, then the receiver can swap the output (interpret 1 when it sees 0, and vice versa) and obtain an equivalent channel with crossover probability formula_10.\nCapacity.\nThe channel capacity of the binary symmetric channel, in bits, is:\nformula_11\nwhere formula_12 is the binary entropy function, defined by:\nformula_13\nNoisy-channel coding theorem.\nShannon's noisy-channel coding theorem gives a result about the rate of information that can be transmitted through a communication channel with arbitrarily low error. We study the particular case of formula_14.\nThe noise formula_15 that characterizes formula_16 is a random variable consisting of n independent random bits (n is defined below) where each random bit is a formula_17 with probability formula_3 and a formula_19 with probability formula_20. We indicate this by writing \"formula_21\".\nWhat this theorem actually implies is, a message when picked from formula_22, encoded with a random encoding function formula_23, and sent across a noisy formula_16, there is a very high probability of recovering the original message by decoding, if formula_25 or in effect the rate of the channel is bounded by the quantity stated in the theorem. The decoding error probability is exponentially small.\nProof.\nThe theorem can be proved directly with a probabilistic method. Consider an encoding function formula_26 that is selected at random. This means that for each message formula_27, the value formula_28 is selected at random (with equal probabilities). For a given encoding function formula_23, the decoding function formula_30 is specified as follows: given any received codeword formula_31, we find the message formula_32 such that the Hamming distance formula_33 is as small as possible (with ties broken arbitrarily). (formula_34 is called a maximum likelihood decoding function.)\nThe proof continues by showing that at least one such choice formula_35 satisfies the conclusion of theorem, by integration over the probabilities. Suppose formula_3 and formula_37 are fixed. First we show that, for a fixed formula_38 and formula_23 chosen randomly, the probability of failure over formula_14 noise is exponentially small in \"n\". At this point, the proof works for a fixed message formula_41. Next we extend this result to work for all messages formula_41. We achieve this by eliminating half of the codewords from the code with the argument that the proof for the decoding error probability holds for at least half of the codewords. The latter method is called expurgation. This gives the total process the name \"random coding with expurgation\".\nConverse of Shannon's capacity theorem.\nThe converse of the capacity theorem essentially states that formula_43 is the best rate one can achieve over a binary symmetric channel. Formally the theorem states:\nThe intuition behind the proof is however showing the number of errors to grow rapidly as the rate grows beyond the channel capacity. The idea is the sender generates messages of dimension formula_25, while the channel formula_14 introduces transmission errors. When the capacity of the channel is formula_46, the number of errors is typically formula_47 for a code of block length formula_48. The maximum number of messages is formula_49. The output of the channel on the other hand has formula_50 possible values. If there is any confusion between any two messages, it is likely that formula_51. Hence we would have formula_52, a case we would like to avoid to keep the decoding error probability exponentially small.\nCodes.\nVery recently, a lot of work has been done and is also being done to design explicit error-correcting codes to achieve the capacities of several standard communication channels. The motivation behind designing such codes is to relate the rate of the code with the fraction of errors which it can correct.\nThe approach behind the design of codes which meet the channel capacities of formula_53 or the binary erasure channel formula_54 have been to correct a lesser number of errors with a high probability, and to achieve the highest possible rate. Shannon's theorem gives us the best rate which could be achieved over a formula_16, but it does not give us an idea of any explicit codes which achieve that rate. In fact such codes are typically constructed to correct only a small fraction of errors with a high probability, but achieve a very good rate. The first such code was due to George D. Forney in 1966. The code is a concatenated code by concatenating two different kinds of codes.\nForney's code.\nForney constructed a concatenated code formula_56 to achieve the capacity of the noisy-channel coding theorem for formula_14. In his code,\nFor the outer code formula_58, a Reed-Solomon code would have been the first code to have come in mind. However, we would see that the construction of such a code cannot be done in polynomial time. This is why a binary linear code is used for formula_58.\nFor the inner code formula_67 we find a linear code by exhaustively searching from the linear code of block length formula_48 and dimension formula_25, whose rate meets the capacity of formula_14, by the noisy-channel coding theorem.\nThe rate formula_82 which almost meets the formula_14 capacity. We further note that the encoding and decoding of formula_84 can be done in polynomial time with respect to formula_59. As a matter of fact, encoding formula_84 takes time formula_87. Further, the decoding algorithm described takes time formula_88 as long as formula_89; and formula_90.\nDecoding error probability.\nA natural decoding algorithm for formula_84 is to:\nNote that each block of code for formula_67 is considered a symbol for formula_58. Now since the probability of error at any index formula_97 for formula_71 is at most formula_99 and the errors in formula_14 are independent, the expected number of errors for formula_71 is at most formula_102 by linearity of expectation. Now applying Chernoff bound, we have bound error probability of more than formula_103 errors occurring to be formula_104. Since the outer code formula_58 can correct at most formula_103 errors, this is the decoding error probability of formula_84. This when expressed in asymptotic terms, gives us an error probability of formula_108. Thus the achieved decoding error probability of formula_84 is exponentially small as the noisy-channel coding theorem.\nWe have given a general technique to construct formula_84. For more detailed descriptions on formula_67 and formula_58 please read the following references. Recently a few other codes have also been constructed for achieving the capacities. LDPC codes have been considered for this purpose for their faster decoding time.\nApplications.\nThe binary symmetric channel can model a disk drive used for memory storage: the channel input represents a bit being written to the disk and the output corresponds to the bit later being read. Error could arise from the magnetization flipping, background noise or the writing head making an error. Other objects which the binary symmetric channel can model include a telephone or radio communication line or cell division, from which the daughter cells contain DNA information from their parent cell.\nThis channel is often used by theorists because it is one of the simplest noisy channels to analyze. Many problems in communication theory can be reduced to a BSC. Conversely, being able to transmit effectively over the BSC can give rise to solutions for more complicated channels.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The leaves are oval, green, 3\u20137.5\u00a0cm long. The flowers are white, extending from red bracts which look somewhat like shrimps, hence the common name \"shrimp flower\".\nThe specific epithet is named for the American botanist Townshend Stith Brandegee (1843\u20131925). It is sometimes misspelled \"brandegeana\".\nDescription.\n\"Justicia brandegeeana\" is a bushy evergreen shrub growing to tall by broad. The stems and leaves are downy. The leaves are variegated and usually grow in clusters on the branches. As the plant receives more sun, the amount of creamy white on the speckled leaves will increase, and vice versa. The flowers emerge from bracts that form off the stems. The bracts start out white, but with more sun exposure they turn anywhere from pale pink to deep salmon. A chain of bracts will continue to grow until it falls off in most cases; thus the chains can grow anywhere from a few centimetres to nearly in length. Flowers emerge from the bracts; usually they are long, thin, and white with speckled maroon throats.\nBlooming continues for months once it has begun, then halts for a short period before starting again. The flowers attract hummingbirds and butterflies. Pollination is usually by hummingbirds\nThe family \"Acanthaceae\" is in the major group Angiosperms (flowering plants). The genus \"Justicia\" is in the family \"Acanthaceae\". The genus \"Justicia\" comprises about 600 species. Research has been done on the phytochemical components of the numerous Justicia species, showing that they possess antitumor, antiviral and antidiabetic activity. \"J. brandegeena\" has not been a topic of phytochemical research until recently.\nPests and diseases.\nSpider mites and whiteflies may be a problem.\nNematodes\nRoot Rot: Fungal diseases that cause decay and rotting of the roots and premature plant death\nFungal leaf spotting or rust may afflict plants.\nCultivation.\nThe shrimp plant thrives in the shade in tropical areas. It does best in well-drained sandy or loamy soil, but is generally low maintenance and drought-tolerant. As it dislikes temperatures below , in cooler temperate areas it is best grown under glass, where it is excellent as a potted houseplant, owing to its ability to tolerate low light and some neglect. Fertilization is not required.\nThe shape is generally long and spindly. If trimmed back regularly, it can maintain a bushy habit and will not need support. If the branches are allowed to grow long, they will become unable to support themselves and sag towards the ground.\nNumerous cultivars are available, with different flower bract colors, including yellow, pink and dark brick-red.\nIt can be propagated by stem cuttings.\nThis plant has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.\nIn terms of maintenance, if \"Justicia brandegeeana\" is not kept well trimmed it can become a messy shrub. Also, if left alone can grow over 24 inches tall. It therefore requires trimming back annually if it is to hold its shape and retain a desirable size. This shrub is expected to last for 10 to 20 years.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Sister-inline/styles.css\"/&gt; Media related to at Wikimedia Commons\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Sister-inline/styles.css\"/&gt; Data related to at Wikispecies"}

A courtier of Emperor Nikephoros I (r.\u2009802\u00a0\u2013\u00a0811), he survived the disastrous campaign against the Bulgars and was preferred as imperial successor over Staurakios (r.\u2009811\u00a0\u2013\u00a0811), who was severely injured. He was proclaimed emperor by Patriarch Nicephorus I of Constantinople on 2 October 811.\nMichael's policies were generally conciliatory, and he was overwhelmingly influenced by the iconodule clerics Nikephoros and Theodore the Stoudite. He improved relations with the Franks, even to the point of recognising Charlemagne as an emperor \u2013 although not \"of the Romans\" \u2013 and requesting papal arbitration in the Moechian controversy. His half-hearted leadership of the campaign against the Bulgars resulted in defeat in the Battle of Versinikia. The \"strat\u0113gos\" of the Anatolic Theme, Leo the Armenian, a popular and successful general, abandoned Michael on the battlefield but was proclaimed emperor by the military, in what was the last military overthrow of an emperor in Byzantine history. Michael was pressured to abdicate, and he retired to a monastery. His sons were castrated to prevent the continuation of his dynasty.\nBiography.\nMichael was the son of the patrician Theophylact Rhangabe, the admiral of the Aegean fleet. The Rangabe family was of Greek origin. He married Prokopia, the daughter of the former Emperor Nikephoros I, and received the high court dignity of \"Kouropalates\" after his father-in-law's accession in 802.\nMichael survived Nikephoros I's disastrous campaign against Khan Krum of Bulgaria, and was considered a more appropriate candidate for the throne than his severely injured brother-in-law Staurakios, who was proclaimed emperor by the military in the hope that he would recover. When Michael's wife Prokopia failed to persuade her brother Staurakios, who wanted to have him blinded, to name Michael as his successor, a group of senior officials (the \"magistros\" Theoktistos, Domestic of the Schools Stephen, and Patriarch Nicephorus I of Constantinople) forced Staurakios to abdicate in his favour on 2 October 811. Michael was proclaimed emperor before the senate and the \"tagmata\".\nMichael I attempted to carry out a policy of reconciliation, abandoning the exacting taxation instituted by Nikephoros I. While reducing imperial income, Michael generously distributed money to the army, the bureaucracy, and the church. Ruling with the support of the iconodule party in the Church, Michael I diligently persecuted the iconoclasts and forced Patriarch Nicephorus I to back down in his dispute with Theodore the Stoudite, the influential abbot of the monastery of Stoudios. He revoked the exile of Theodore the Stoudites effected by Emperor Nikephoros I, and Theodore became his close confidant. Michael I's piety won him a very positive estimation in the work of the chronicler Theophanes the Confessor. Theophanes also mentions the existence of a group of heretics known as \"Athinganoi\" in Phrygia, who were most likely the successors of the Montanists, who Emperor Leo III the Isaurian (r.\u2009717\u00a0\u2013\u00a0741) attempted to convert by force, as well as of the Paulicians. Patriarch Nicephorus I pressed Michael I to organise the persecution and execution of the \"Athinganoi\", Paulicians and iconoclast abbots. But when Nicephorus I insisted the heretics be given time to repent, Michael I halted the killings.\nIn 812, Michael reopened negotiations with the Franks, and recognized Charlemagne as \"imperator\" and \"basileus\" (\"emperor\"), but not \"Emperor of the Romans\". In exchange for that recognition, Venice and Istria were returned to the Empire. Michael I sent ambassadors to negotiate a marriage alliance between Michael's son Theophylact and a Frankish princess. They also brought a letter from Patriarch Nicephorus I requesting papal arbitration on the issue of the Moechian controversy. Pope Leo III resolved the issue in favour of Theodore the Stoudites, who claimed that, as emperors were bound by canon law, Constantine VI's second marriage was illicit, which was the view of Empress Irene against Emperor Nikephoros. The Pope's judgment was treated as the formal closing of the affair.\nThere were also minor successes against the Arabs in the Anatolic Theme under its \"strat\u0113gos\" Leo the Armenian, another figure exiled by Nikephoros and recalled by Michael. However, Michael dealt with the Bulgars poorly during his reign. In 812, Khan Krum besieged the frontier town of Develtos in Thrace, and Michael was too late to prevent its surrender. His soldiers mutinied, and people in western Thrace began to flee their homes. Some soldiers of the \"tagmata\" tried to proclaim the blinded sons of Constantine V as emperors, but Michael dismissed them in disgrace. The Bulgars nevertheless managed to capture almost all of the fortified towns on the Byzantine-Bulgarian border that were built and consolidated by Empress Irene and Emperors Constantine VI and Nikephoros in the previous decades. Michael was convinced by Nikephoros and Theodore to reject the peace terms offered by Krum, which involved the return of Christians who fled from Bulgarian territory, provoking the capture of Mesembria (Nesebar) by the Bulgars, the last border stronghold, executing all captives who refused to renounce Christianity. Michael I's army prepared for a major engagement at Versinikia near Adrianople, but delayed his attack, leading to further discontent in the military. In June, he began the attack but appeared hesitant; Leo the Armenian fled halfway through the battle, causing a rout. This prompted suspicion of treachery, however, Leo was acclaimed emperor with the support of his soldiers. Once he arrived in Constantinople, Michael I was pressured to retire to a monastery. Leo was crowned by Patriarch Nicephorus I on 12 July 813.\nWith conspiracy in the air, Michael I preempted events by abdicating on 11 July 813 in favour of Leo the Armenian and becoming a monk (under the name Athanasios). His sons were castrated to end the dynasty and were relegated to monasteries, with one of them, Niketas (renamed Ignatios), eventually becoming Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople. Michael I died on 11 January 844.\nNumismatics.\nThe numismatic record of Michael's reign begins after his son's coronation as co-emperor in 811, with new \"nomismata\" struck, bearing Michael I on the obverse and Theophylact (son of Michael I) on the reverse. The \"miliar\u0113sion\", which had not been struck since the reign of Constantine VI (r.\u2009780\u00a0\u2013\u00a0797), was revived by Michael I with a notable alteration. The imperial title \"basileis\" was expanded to \"basileis romaion\" (\"emperors of the Romans\"), seemingly in response to Pope Leo III's coronation of Charlemagne as emperor in 800.\nAssessment and legacy.\nThe reigns of the iconoclast emperors Leo III the Isaurian (r.\u2009717\u00a0\u2013\u00a0741) and Constantine V (r.\u2009741\u00a0\u2013\u00a0775) were militarily successful and saw the abatement of the Arab and Bulgar threat. According to the iconodule Patriarch Nicephorus I of Constantinople, Leo III the Isaurian propaganda ascribed both their military successes and longevity to their iconoclasm. The validity of iconoclasm was only confirmed by the military disasters under the iconodule emperors Michael I and his predecessor Nikephoros I (r.\u2009802\u00a0\u2013\u00a0811) as well as the success of the iconoclast Leo V the Armenian (r.\u2009813\u00a0\u2013\u00a0820) against the Bulgars. Michael I was in general a weak emperor whose policies were formed in mere reaction to outside pressures. Warren Treadgold describes him as \"amiable to a fault, lacking in judgment and easily led\", \"dithering\", seeming \"to have done whatever he had been told most recently\". He was also the last Byzantine emperor to be overthrown by the military, which is ironic given its increased strength in succeeding centuries.\nIn 813, Carolingian Emperor Charlemagne crowned his son Louis the Pious co-emperor in a manner resembling Michael I's crowning of his own son, Theophylact, in 811. This was likely because of the Byzantine practice of inviting foreign ambassadors to witness state rituals. Accepting one such invitation, Hugh of Tours, Count of Tours, and Haito, Bishop of Basel, were present for Michael I's crowning of his son, and so probably returned to the Frankish court with knowledge of Byzantine ceremonies.\nFamily.\nBy his wife Prokopia, Michael I had at least five children:\nNotes and references.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "74374", "revid": "2292051", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=74374", "title": "Michael III", "text": "Byzantine emperor from 842 to 867\nMichael III (; 9/10 January 840 \u2013 24 September 867), also known as Michael the Drunkard, was Byzantine emperor from 842 to 867. Michael III was the third and traditionally last member of the Amorian (or Phrygian) dynasty. He was given the disparaging epithet \"the Drunkard\" () by the hostile historians of the succeeding Macedonian dynasty, but modern historical research has rehabilitated his reputation to some extent, demonstrating the vital role his reign played in the resurgence of Byzantine power in the 9th century. He was also the youngest person to bear the imperial title (aged 4 months), as well as the youngest to succeed as senior emperor (aged 2) in the Roman Empire. In 867, Michael was assassinated by his successor, Basil I.\nLife.\nEarly life and regency.\nMichael was the youngest child of the emperor Theophilos and his empress Theodora. His precise date of birth is uncertain, but the balance of available evidence supports a birthdate in early 840, probably on 9 or 10 January. He was crowned co-emperor soon after, probably on 16 May of the same year. Michael had just turned two years old when his father died, and Michael succeeded him as sole emperor on 20 January 842.\nDuring Michael's minority, the empire was governed by a regency headed by his mother Theodora, her uncle Sergios, and the eunuch Theoktistos, who was Postal Logothete and the most powerful of the three. Within a year the regents had begun to carefully plan a program of restoring iconophile orthodoxy. Stories of Theodora's secret devotion to images during Theophilos' reign are dubious and she was likely motivated not only by religious but also political and pragmatic concerns. Theoktistos had been an enthusiastic supporter of Theophilos and so was clearly motivated by pragmatism in endorsing the later iconophile program. Yet there was little opposition other than from John VII and the clergy of the Hagia Sophia. The future Patriarch Methodios I held a synod in the Palace of Blachernae rather than in the patriarchal church, which suggests that they resisted the changes. However in March, the \"Acts\" of the Second Council of Nicaea (787) were reaffirmed and the leading iconoclasts of the Council of Constantinople of 815 declared to be heretics. Theophilos was not mentioned in order to not alienate the ruling imperial family and its supporters. Theodora had also explicitly demanded that her husband not be dishonoured. Patriarch John VII of Constantinople was then asked to resign, and replaced him with the iconophile Methodios, who, despite his iconophilism, was a close associate of Theophilos. The occasion was marked with a solemn procession on the first Sunday of Lent (11 March 843), from Blachernae to the Hagia Sophia, followed by a liturgy in the church. These events came to be known as the \"Triumph of Orthodoxy\". Methodios carried out an expulsion of iconoclast clergy and was later accused of fomenting dissension within the church. The sources, which are sympathetic to iconophilism, do not report much dissent among the clergy or general population, which suggests a general passivity or neutrality on the issue. With these events the second spell of Byzantine iconoclasm was put to an end, and the autonomy of the Church was affirmed against imperial power.\nAs the emperor was growing up, the courtiers around him fought for influence. Theoktistos disliked Michael's uncle Bardas, and excluded him from court politics. When Theodora and Theoktistos arranged the marriage of Eudokia Dekapolitissa to Michael, who preferred Eudokia Ingerina, Bardas won his nephew's favour by persuading him to allow a plot to murder Theoktistos. In 855, the regency was overthrown when Theoktistos was murdered in the Great Palace of Constantinople, and in 857, Theodora was barred from government and relegated along with her daughters to a monastery in 857.\nWarfare and foreign policy.\nThe internal stabilisation of the state was not entirely matched along the frontiers. Although the Abbasid Caliphate was no longer launching major invasions, and raids were led by local amirs along the frontier rather than the Caliph himself, Byzantine forces were defeated by the Abbasids in Pamphylia, Crete, and on the border with Syria, but a Byzantine fleet of 85 ships did score a victory over the Arabs in 853. There were also many operations around the Aegean and off the Syrian coast by at least three more fleets, numbering 300 ships total. The Byzantines were able to successfully assault Damietta in Egypt in 853. In the 820s, Andalusian Arab pirates seized Crete, which Theoktistos attempted to regain in the first year of the regency, though unsuccessfully. Bardas was planning to sail there but was murdered on the instigation of Basil in 866. The recapture was not achieved until 961, long after Michael's reign.\nA conflict between the Byzantines and the First Bulgarian Empire occurred during 855 and 856. The Byzantine Empire wanted to regain its control over some areas of Thrace, including Philippopolis and the ports around the Gulf of Burgas on the Black Sea. Byzantine forces, led by the emperor and the caesar Bardas, were successful in reconquering a number of cities \u2013 Philippopolis, Develtus, Anchialus and Mesembria among them \u2013 as well as the region of Zagora. At the time of this campaign the Bulgarians were distracted by a war with the Franks under Louis the German and the Croatians. In 853, Khan Boris I of Bulgaria had allied himself to Duke Rastislav of Moravia against the Franks. The Bulgarians were heavily defeated by the Franks; following this, the Moravians changed sides and the Bulgarians then faced threats from Moravia.\nFollowing an expedition led by Michael's uncle and general, Petronas, against the Paulicians from the eastern frontier and the Arab borderlands in 856, the imperial government resettled them in Thrace, thus cutting them off from their coreligionists and populating another border region. The Paulicians, whose power centre was Tephrike, were heavily persecuted after the restoration of icons as they were deemed unorthodox. It was only in 872 that Christopher, Domestic of the Schools, defeated their leader Chrysocheir, and Tephrike was taken in 878. Michael was also responsible, as per the writings of Constantine VII, for the subjugation of the Slavs settled in the Peloponnese.\nMichael took an active part in the wars against the Abbasids and their vassals on the eastern frontier from 856 to 863, and particularly in 857 when he sent an army of 50,000 men against Emir Umar al-Aqta of Melitene. In 859, he personally led a siege on Samosata, but in 860 had to abandon the expedition to repel a naval attack by the Rus' on Constantinople. The Rus' fleet plundered the outer suburbs of the city but left of their own volition, probably because they had acquired sufficient booty. The subsequent relationship with the Rus' was mixed; they requested a Byzantine mission which was short-lived, and engaged in further raids but also trade in the tenth century. It was only in the late tenth century that the Christianisation of the Rus' was achieved by Grand Prince Vladimir of Kiev.\nSoon after the raid, Duke Rastislav requested a Byzantine mission, perhaps to secure a political counterweight to his neighbours; the Franks and the Bulgars. In 863, they sent Cyril and Methodius, who were from Thessalonika. They developed the first Slavic alphabet, the Glagolitic alphabet, and translated many religious texts into this new literary language. Their mission ceased when Rastislav died and other Slavic princes as well as the Franks pressured them. Nevertheless Cyril, Methodius and their disciples were influential in the newly Christian Bulgaria, where they were exiled to from Moravia in 885. They were installed at Ohrid and Pliska, where they were charged with the creation of a Slavic clergy and the expounding of Christianity in the Slavic vernacular, although Greek remained the liturgical and ceremonial language.\nIn 863, Petronas defeated and killed the emir of Melitene at the Battle of Lalakaon, and celebrated a triumph in the capital. The year 863 is seen as a turning point in the Arab-Byzantine wars, after which the Byzantines began to go on the offensive, leading to their triumph in the tenth century.\nWithin the decentralising Abbasid Caliphate, the Armenians, who were vassals of the Abbasids, even participating in the Sack of Amorion of 838, gained a degree of independence. Ashot I of Armenia was crowned king of Armenia in 884, and recognised by Michael and Basil as \"prince of princes\". Friendly relations between Byzantium and Armenia continued into the tenth century, to the benefit of Byzantine eastward expansion.\nPhotian schism and Christianisation of Bulgaria.\nBardas justified his usurpation of the regency by introducing various internal reforms. Under the influence of both Bardas and Photios, Michael presided over the reconstruction of ruined cities and structures, the reopening of closed monasteries, and the fostering of intellectual life in the form of the reorganisation of the imperial university at the Maganaura palace under Leo the Mathematician.\nPhotios, originally a layman, had entered holy orders and was promoted to the position of patriarch on the dismissal of the troublesome Ignatios in 858. Ignatios was a castrated son of Michael I Rhangabe (r.\u2009811\u00a0\u2013\u00a0813) and had deposed one of his predecessor Methodios' associates, Gregory Asbestas, the archbishop of Syracuse. Gregory appealed to the Bishop of Rome. While Gregory awaited a reply, Ignatios was deposed. In spring 859, Ignatios' supporters met in Constantinople and claimed they had deposed Photios, who responded with a synod attacking Ignatios. The stalemate prompted Michael and Photios to send an embassy to Pope Nicholas I, whose legates Radoald of Porto and Zacharias of Anagni approved the deposition of Ignatios at the Council of Constantinople of 861. However, perhaps partly due to the presence of Ignatios' supporters in Rome, Nicholas convened a council in 863 to overrule his legates, declaring that Photios and Asbestas were deposed, leading to the Photian schism. Michael then wrote a contemptuous letter about the alleged barbarity of Latin Rome.\nFearing the potential conversion of Boris I of Bulgaria (r.\u2009852\u00a0\u2013\u00a0889) to Christianity under Frankish influence, Michael III and the Caesar Bardas invaded Bulgaria, imposing the conversion of Boris according to the Byzantine rite, as part of the peace settlement of 864. Michael stood as sponsor, by proxy, for Boris at his baptism. Boris took the additional name of Michael at the ceremony. The Byzantines also allowed the Bulgarians to reclaim the contested border region of Zagora. In 866, Boris appeared to have second thoughts and sought patronage from the Franks and Pope Nicholas I, requesting a Latin archbishop. He corresponded with Nicholas, who responded to him by expressing approval of Bulgar customs and severely criticising those of Byzantium. Photios responded by enumerating western doctrinal and disciplinary deviations in an encyclical, deposing Nicholas and requesting Louis the German's aid in overthrowing him. Michael presided over a synod in 867 in which Photios and the three other eastern patriarchs excommunicated Pope Nicholas and condemned the Latin \"filioque\" clause concerning the procession of the Holy Spirit. The conflict over the patriarchal throne and supreme authority within the church was exacerbated by the success of the active missionary efforts launched by Photios. In the same year, Michael was assassinated and Basil reinstated Ignatios. Despite Ignatios' papal leanings in the Photian schism, he allowed Boris to procure a Byzantine-rite archbishop in 870, and the eastern patriarchs forcefully denied any Roman authority in Bulgaria. Byzantine cultural hegemony was secured, and relations between the two empires remained peaceful throughout Michael's reign. The conversion of the Bulgarians has been evaluated as one of the greatest cultural and political achievements of the Byzantine Empire.\nUnder the guidance of Patriarch Photios, Michael sponsored the mission of Saints Cyril and Methodios to the Khazar Khagan in an effort to stop the expansion of Judaism among the Khazars. Although this mission was a failure, their next mission in 863 secured the conversion of Great Moravia and devised the Glagolitic alphabet for writing in Slavonic, thus allowing Slavic-speaking peoples to approach conversion to Orthodox Christianity through their own rather than an alien tongue.\nRise of Basil the Macedonian and assassination of Michael.\nMichael III's marriage with Eudokia Dekapolitissa was childless, but the Emperor did not want to risk a scandal by attempting to marry his mistress Eudokia Ingerina, daughter of the Varangian (Norse) imperial guard Inger. The solution he chose was to have Ingerina marry his favorite courtier and chamberlain Basil the Macedonian. While Michael carried on his relationship with Ingerina, Basil was kept satisfied with the emperor's sister Thekla, whom her brother retrieved from a monastery. According to Joseph Genesios, Michael met Basil when he heard of his wrestling ability, while other sources state that they met when Basil successfully broke in one of the Emperor's horses. Whatever the circumstances of their acquaintance, Basil was made \"pr\u014dtostrat\u014dr\" (head groom) following the execution of the incumbent, a co-conspirator in a plot of Theodora against Bardas. Michael and Basil appeared to have a common interest in equestrianism, since Michael's favourite pastimes included hunting and chariot-racing, to which end he built luxury stables.\nScholars are divided as to whether Michael and Basil were engaged in a homosexual relationship. One piece of evidence for this is Basil's appointment as \"parakoim\u014dmenos\", which was usually for the chief eunuch and involved close proximity to the Emperor. It is clear that they had a close relationship, with Basil gaining increasing influence over Michael. In April 866, he convinced the Emperor that Bardas was conspiring against him and was duly allowed to murder Bardas while he was preparing to embark on an expedition to Crete. Now without serious rivals, Basil was crowned co-emperor on 26 May 866 and was adopted by the much younger Michael.\nThis curious development may have been intended to legitimise the eventual succession to the throne of Eudokia Ingerina's son Leo, who was widely believed to be Michael's son. Michael celebrated the birth of Leo with public chariot races, a sport he enthusiastically patronized and participated in.\nIf ensuring Leo's legitimacy had been Michael's plan, it backfired. Ostensibly troubled by the favour Michael was beginning to show to another courtier, named Basiliskianos, whom he threatened to raise as another co-emperor, Basil had Michael assassinated as he lay insensible in his bedchamber following a drinking bout on 24 September 867. Basil with a number of his male relatives, plus other accomplices, entered Michael's apartment; the locks had been tampered with and no guard had been placed. Michael's end was grisly; a man named John of Chaldia killed him, cutting off both the emperor's hands with a sword before finishing him off with a thrust to the heart. Basil, as the sole remaining emperor (Basiliskianos had presumably been disposed of at the same time as Michael), automatically succeeded as the ruling \"basileus\".\nMichael's remains were buried in the Philippikos Monastery at Chrysopolis on the Asian shore of the Bosphoros. When Leo VI became ruling emperor in 886, one of his first acts was to have Michael's body exhumed and reburied, with great ceremony, in the imperial mausoleum in the Church of the Holy Apostles in Constantinople. This contributed to the suspicion held by the Byzantine public that Leo was (or at least believed himself to be) Michael's son.\nAssessment and legacy.\nThe reign and personality of Michael are difficult to evaluate because of the hostile accounts written by Byzantine authors operating under Basil I (r.\u2009867\u00a0\u2013\u00a0886) and his successors. Byzantine accounts describe Michael's habitual drunkenness, his obsession with chariot racing and his orchestration of public displays mocking the processions and rituals of the church. His court's politics were characterised by scandal including the assassinations of Bardas, Theoktistos and bizarre relationships with his wife, Eudokia Dekapolitissa, mistress, Eudokia Ingerina and Basil's mistress, Michael's own sister Thekla. And finally Michael's own assassination at the hands of his trusted courtier Basil. The impression gained from Arab sources, however, is one of Michael as an active and often successful military commander. He was also very active in repairing the Walls of Constantinople. Chroniclers of Basil accuse Michael of allowing the registers of military personnel to decline, forcing Basil to undertake a major recruitment effort during his own reign, however the decline could be explained as a natural process due to aging.\nAs the end of the iconoclast period, Michael's reign was the beginning of a period of religious peace with an established orthodoxy and liturgy, which was not to be interfered with by the emperor.\nDespite the bias of the sources, there was a clear continuity in policy between Michael and Basil, which was in the security of the borders with the Abbasid Caliphate and First Bulgarian Empire, as well as opportunism regarding the Moravians, Armenians and Rus'.\nThough Michael was allegedly prone to squander money, his reign stabilised the economy, and by the year 850 the empire's annual revenues had increased to 3,300,000 \"nomismata\". The definitive end to iconoclasm early in his reign led, unsurprisingly, to a renaissance in visual arts. The Empire made considerable advances in internal organisation and religious cohesion, and it had more than held its own against the Abbasid Caliphate. Most importantly Bulgaria had been transformed into a religious and cultural satellite of Byzantium. Much of the credit for these achievements, however, must go to Theodora and Theoktistos up to 855, and Bardas and Petronas thereafter.\nFamily.\nMichael III had no children by his wife Eudokia Dekapolitissa but was conjectured to have fathered one or two sons by his mistress Eudokia Ingerina, who was married to Basil I:\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It tells the story of a small-town Indiana high school basketball team and its journey to the state championship finals. It is inspired in part by the Milan High School team who won the 1954 state championship against Muncie Central High School.\nGene Hackman stars as Norman Dale, a new coach with a spotty past. The film co-stars Barbara Hershey and Dennis Hopper, whose role as the basketball-loving town drunk earned him an Academy Award nomination. Jerry Goldsmith was also nominated for an Academy Award for his score. In 2001, \"Hoosiers\" was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.\"\nPlot.\nIn 1951, Norman Dale arrives in rural Hickory, Indiana. His old friend, high school principal Cletus Summers, has hired him as the civics and history teacher and as head basketball coach.\nThe townspeople, passionate about basketball, are disappointed that Hickory's best player, Jimmy Chitwood, has left the team following the death of the previous coach, who had been a surrogate father to Jimmy. At a meet-and-greet, Norman tells the townspeople he used to coach college basketball. The next day, fellow teacher Myra Fleener warns Norman not to recruit Jimmy. She is encouraging Jimmy to focus solely on his studies so that he will have a future away from Hickory.\nThe small school has only seven players. At the first practice, Norman dismisses Buddy Walker for rudeness, causing another player, Whit Butcher, to walk out in protest. Norman begins drilling the others (Rade Butcher, Merle Webb, Everett Flatch, Strap Purl, and equipment manager Ollie McLellan) with fundamentals and conditioning but no scrimmages or shooting, much to the Huskers' dismay. Whit later apologizes to the coach and rejoins the team.\nNorman instructs the Huskers to pass four times before shooting. During the season opener, Rade disobeys and repeatedly makes baskets without passing first. The coach benches him for the rest of the game, even when Merle fouls out, leaving only four Huskers on the floor. In a subsequent game, when a rival player jabs Norman in the chest during an on-court argument, Rade jumps to his defense and hits the player. During the altercation, Cletus, acting as assistant coach, suffers a mild heart attack. Norman further erodes community support by employing a slow, defensive style that does not immediately produce results. The coach also loses his temper on court and gets ejected from two games.\nWith Cletus laid up, Norman asks former Husker Wilbur \"Shooter\" Flatch, Everett's alcoholic father, to be his assistant coach, with the requirement that Shooter be sober during all games and practices. Shooter agrees, on the condition that Norman not get ejected from any more games. The choice of Shooter confounds the town and embarrasses Everett.\nMid-season, disgruntled townspeople decide to vote on dismissing Norman. Before the meeting, Myra, sensing something amiss regarding Norman's past, uncovers years-old information about his hitting a player and being banned from coaching. At the meeting, Myra goes up to the lectern, intending to read aloud the article she found, but she changes her mind and instead asks the townspeople to give Norman another chance. Nevertheless, they vote to fire the coach. Then Jimmy Chitwood arrives and announces he will rejoin the team, but only if Norman remains as coach. A new vote is taken, and the residents overwhelmingly choose to keep him.\nAfter Jimmy's return, the reinvigorated Huskers rack up a series of wins. To prove to the townspeople (and to Shooter himself) Shooter's value to the team, Norman intentionally gets ejected from a game. This forces Shooter to devise a play that helps Hickory win on a last-second shot. Shooter also regains the respect of his son, Everett.\nDespite a setback when Shooter relapses, the team advances through the state tournament with Jimmy's strong performance. Unsung players, such as short Ollie and devoutly religious Strap, also contribute. Hickory reaches the championship game in Indianapolis. At Butler Fieldhouse, and before the largest crowd they have ever seen, the Huskers face long odds to defeat the heavily favored South Bend Central Bears, who have taller and more athletic players. After falling behind, Hickory fights their way back and ties the game with just a few seconds left. Norman calls a timeout and sets up a play where Jimmy will be a decoy for Merle, who will take the last shot. The Huskers look uncomfortable, and when Norman demands to know what's wrong, Jimmy simply says, \"I'll make it.\" Norman nods in approval and sets up a new play for Jimmy. He scores just before the buzzer sounds, securing the victory for Hickory, the smallest school to ever win the Indiana state championship.\nSometime in the future, a boy shoots baskets in Hickory's home gym. A large black-and-white team portrait with their state championship trophy is seen hanging on the wall, and a voiceover from Coach Dale states, \"I love you guys.\"\nCast.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;* Gene Hackman as Coach Norman Dale\nInspiration.\n The film is inspired in part by the story of the 1954 Indiana state champions, Milan High School ( ). The phrase \"inspired by a true story\" is more appropriate than \"based on a true story\" because the two teams have little in common.\nIn most U.S. states, high school athletic teams are divided into different classes, usually based on the number of enrolled students, with separate state championship tournaments held for each classification. In 1954, Indiana conducted a single state basketball tournament for all its high schools. This practice continued until 1997.\nSome plot points are similar to Milan's real story. Like the film's fictional Hickory High School, Milan was a very small high school in a rural, southern Indiana town. Both schools had undersized teams. Both Hickory and Milan won the state finals by 2 points: Hickory won 42\u201340, and Milan won 32\u201330. The last seconds of the \"Hoosiers\" state final are fairly close to the details of Milan's 1954 final; the last basket in the film was made from virtually the same spot on the floor as Bobby Plump's actual game-winner. The movie's final game was filmed in the same gymnasium that hosted the 1954 Indiana state championship game, Butler University's Hinkle Fieldhouse (called Butler Fieldhouse in 1954) in Indianapolis.\nUnlike the film's plot, the 1954 Milan Indians came into the season as heavy favorites and finished the '53\u2013'54 regular season at 19\u20132. In addition, the 1952\u20131953 team went to the state semifinals, and they were considered a powerhouse going into the championship season despite the school's small enrollment.\nProduction.\nDuring filming in the autumn of 1985, on location at Hinkle Fieldhouse, directors were unable to secure enough extras for shooting the final scenes even after casting calls through the Indianapolis media. To help fill the stands, they invited two local high schools to move a game to the Fieldhouse. Broad Ripple and Chatard, the alma mater of Maris Valainis who played the role of Jimmy Chitwood, obliged, and crowd shots were filmed during their actual game. Fans of both schools came out in period costumes to serve as extras and to supplement the hundreds of locals who had answered the call. At halftime and following the game, actors took to the court to shoot footage of the state championship scenes, including the game-winning shot by Hickory.\nThe film's producers chose New Richmond, Indiana to serve as the fictional town of Hickory and recorded most of the film's location shots in and around the community. Signs on the roads into New Richmond still recall its role in the film. In addition, the old schoolhouse in Nineveh was used for the majority of the classroom scenes and many other scenes throughout the film.\nThe home court of Hickory is located in Knightstown and is now known as the \"Hoosier Gym.\"\nPizzo and Anspaugh shopped the script for two years before they finally found investment for the project. Despite this seeming approval, the financiers approved a production budget of only $6 million, forcing the crew to hire most of the cast playing the Hickory basketball team and many of the extras from the local community around New Richmond. Gene Hackman also predicted that the film would be a \"career killer.\" Despite the small budget, dire predictions, and little help from distributor Orion Pictures, \"Hoosiers\" grossed over $28 million and received two Oscar nominations (Dennis Hopper for Best Supporting Actor and Jerry Goldsmith for Best Original Score).\nShortly after the film's release, five of the actors who portrayed basketball players in the film were suspended by the NCAA from their real-life college basketball teams for three games. The NCAA determined that they had been paid to play basketball, making them ineligible.\nSoundtrack.\nThe music to \"Hoosiers\" was written by veteran composer Jerry Goldsmith. Goldsmith used a hybrid of orchestral and electronic elements in juxtaposition to the 1950s setting to score the film. He also helped tie the music to the film by using recorded hits of basketballs on a gymnasium floor to serve as additional percussion sounds. \"Washington Post\" film critic Paul Attanasio praised the soundtrack, writing, \"And it's marvelously (and innovatively) scored (by composer Jerry Goldsmith), who weaves together electronics with symphonic effects to create a sense of the rhythmic energy of basketball within a traditional setting.\"\nThe score gained Goldsmith an Oscar nomination for Best Original Score, though he ultimately lost to Herbie Hancock for \"Round Midnight\". Goldsmith would later work with filmmakers Angelo Pizzo and David Anspaugh again on their successful 1993 sports film \"Rudy\".\nUntil 2012, the soundtrack was primarily available under the European title \"Best Shot\", with several of the film's cues not included on the album. In 2012, Intrada Records released Goldsmith's complete score, marking the first time the soundtrack has been released on CD in the United States.\nReception.\nCritical response.\nOn Rotten Tomatoes the film holds an approval rating of 92% based on 48 reviews, with an average rating of 7.6/10. The website's critics consensus reads: \"It may adhere to the sports underdog formula, but \"Hoosiers\" has been made with such loving craft, and features such excellent performances, that it's hard to resist.\" Metacritic assigned the film a weighted average score of 76 out of 100, based on 13 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews.\" Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A\" on A+ to F scale.\n\"Chicago Sun-Times\" critic Roger Ebert praised the film, writing: \"What makes \"Hoosiers\" special is not its story but its details and its characters. Angelo Pizzo, who wrote the original screenplay, knows small-town sports. He knows all about high school politics and how the school board and the parents' groups always think they know more about basketball than the coach does. He knows about gossip, scandal and vengeance. And he knows a lot about human nature. All of his knowledge, however, would be pointless without Hackman's great performance at the center of this movie. Hackman is gifted at combining likability with complexity \u2014 two qualities that usually don't go together in the movies. He projects all of the single-mindedness of any good coach, but then he contains other dimensions, and we learn about the scandal in his past that led him to this one-horse town. David Anspaugh's direction is good at suggesting Hackman's complexity without belaboring it.\" \"The New York Times\"' Janet Maslin echoed Ebert's sentiments, writing, \"This film's very lack of surprise and sophistication accounts for a lot of its considerable charm.\"\n\"Washington Post\" critics Rita Kempley and Paul Attanasio both enjoyed the film, despite its perceived sentimentalism and lack of originality. Kempley wrote, \"Even though we've seen it all before, \"Hoosiers\" scores big by staying small.\" Attanasio pointed out some problems with the film: \"[It contains] some klutzy glitches in continuity, and a love story (between Hackman and a sterile, one-note Barbara Hershey) that goes nowhere. The action photography flattens the visual excitement of basketball (you can imagine what a Scorsese would do with it);\" but he noted the film's \"enormous craftsmanship accumulates till you're actually seduced into believing all its Pepperidge Farm buncombe. That's quite an achievement.\"\n\"Time\" magazine's Richard Schickel praised the performance of Gene Hackman, writing that he was { \"Variety\" wrote that the {\nPat Graham of the \"Chicago Reader\" was a rare dissenter, writing of the film that {\n\"Chicago Tribune\" critic Gene Siskel also criticized the film, calling it sentimental and predictable.\nAccolades.\n\"Hoosiers\" has been named by many publications as the best or one of the best sports movies ever made.\n\"Hoosiers\" was ranked number 13 by the American Film Institute on its 100 Years... 100 Cheers list of most inspirational films. The film was the choice of the readers of \"USA Today\" as the best sports movie of all time. In 2001, \"Hoosiers\" was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\" due in part to an especially large number of nominations from Indiana citizens.\nIn June 2008, AFI revealed its \"Ten Top Ten\" \u2014 the best ten films in ten classic American film genres \u2014 after polling over 1,500 people from the creative community. \"Hoosiers\" was acknowledged as the fourth best film in the sports genre.\nA museum to commemorate the real-life achievements of the 1954 Milan team has been established.\nIn 2015, MGM partnered with the Indiana Pacers to create Hickory uniforms inspired by the film. The Pacers first wore the tribute uniforms during select games in the 2015\u201316 NBA regular season in honor of the film's 30th anniversary.\nIn April 2017, Vice President (and former governor of Indiana) Mike Pence said that \"Hoosiers\" is the \"greatest sports movie ever made\" while traveling on a flight from Indonesia to Australia with a pool of journalists.\nAmerican Film Institute Lists\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "74377", "revid": "24902", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=74377", "title": "Michael II", "text": "Byzantine emperor from 820 to 829\nMichael II (, ; 770 \u2013 2 October 829), called the Amorian (, ) and the Stammerer (, or , ), reigned as Byzantine emperor from 25 December 820 to his death on 2 October 829, the first ruler of the Amorian dynasty.\nBorn in Amorium, Michael was a soldier, rising to high rank along with his colleague Leo V the Armenian (r.\u2009813\u00a0\u2013\u00a0820). He helped Leo overthrow and take the place of Emperor Michael I Rhangabe. However, after they fell out Leo sentenced Michael to death. Michael then masterminded a conspiracy which resulted in Leo's assassination at Christmas in 820. Immediately he faced the long revolt of Thomas the Slav, which almost cost him his throne and was not completely quelled until spring 824. The later years of his reign were marked by two major military disasters that had long-term effects: the beginning of the Muslim conquest of Sicily, and the loss of Crete to Andalusian Arab pirates. Domestically, he supported and strengthened the resumption of official iconoclasm, which had begun again under Leo V.\nEarly life.\nMichael was born c.\u2009770 in Amorium, in Phrygia, into a Cappadocian family of professional peasant-soldiers who received land from the government for their military service. They may have been members of the sect of the \"Athinganoi\".\nMichael first rose to prominence as a close aide (\"spatharios\") of the general Bardanes Tourkos, alongside his future antagonists Leo the Armenian and Thomas the Slav. He married Bardanes' daughter Thekla, while Leo married another daughter. Michael and Leo abandoned Bardanes shortly after he rebelled against Emperor Nikephoros I in 803, and they were rewarded with higher military commands: Michael was named the Emperor's Count of the Tent. Michael was instrumental in Leo's overthrow of Michael I Rhangabe in 813, after Rangabe's repeated military defeats against the Bulgarians. Under Leo V, Michael was appointed to command the elite \"tagma\" of the Excubitors.\nThekla and Michael had only one known son, Theophilos (813 \u2013 20 January 842). The existence of a daughter called Helena is possible but there is a contradiction between different sources. Helena is known as the wife of Theophobos, a patrician executed in 842 for conspiring to gain the throne for himself. George Hamartolos and Theophanes report him marrying the sister of the Empress Theodora. Joseph Genesius records Theophobos marrying the sister of the Emperor Theophilos. Whether Helena was sister or sister-in-law to Theophilos is thus unclear.\nMichael became disgruntled with Leo V when he divorced Michael's sister-in-law. In late 820, agents of the Postal Logothete uncovered a plot led by Michael to overthrow Leo, who then imprisoned Michael and sentenced him to death by burning. Empress consort Theodosia secured a postponement of the execution until after Christmas. This allowed Michael to rally undetected plotters to assassinate Leo on Christmas morning in the palace chapel and castrate his sons to prevent the continuation of his dynasty. Michael was immediately proclaimed emperor, while still wearing prison chains on his legs. Later the same day, he was crowned by Patriarch Theodotus I of Constantinople.\nReign.\nIn his internal policy, Michael II supported iconoclasm, but he tacitly encouraged reconciliation with the iconodules, whom he generally stopped persecuting, allowing those exiled by Emperor Leo V the Armenian to return. These included the former patriarch Nikephoros, Anthony the Confessor, and Theodore the Stoudite, who failed, however, to persuade the emperor to abandon iconoclasm. Michael also did not restore the exiled iconodules to their previous positions. Theodore also requested permission to restore icons, resume relations with the bishop of Rome and recognise him as the head of all churches and therefore arbiter of disputes. Michael allowed iconodules to follow their conscience outside of Constantinople but did not make any further concessions, refusing to change imperial policy and banning discussion of the Council of Hieria (754), Second Council of Nicaea (787) and Council of Constantinople (815). When Patriarch Theodotos died in 821, Michael appointed the iconoclast Antony, bishop of Syllaion, against the aspirations of the iconodules.\nRevolt of Thomas the Slav: 821\u2013823.\nMichael's accession prompted his former comrade-in-arms Thomas the Slav to set himself up as rival emperor in Anatolia to avenge Leo V. He had been made the \"tourmarch\u0113s\" of the \"Foederati\" (a command in the Anatolic Theme) by Leo, and so bore at least nominal allegiance to him. The \"strat\u0113gos\" of Sicily, Gregory, also proclaimed allegiance to Leo against Michael but was killed by soldiers under the \"tourmarch\u0113s\" Euphemios which secured the loyalty of the Sicilian fleet to Michael. Thomas was supported by the Bucellarian, Paphlagonian and Cibyrrhaeot themes, while Michael held the European part of the Empire including the Opsikion (commanded by his relative Katakylas), Thracesian, Armeniac and Chaldian themes. To strengthen his position, he won the support of iconodules by stopping persecution, recalling exiled bishops and offering to reinstate Patriarch Nikephoros I of Constantinople if he ignored the iconoclast controversy, which he refused to do.\nIn his quest for support, Thomas presented himself as a champion of the poor, reduced taxation, and concluded an alliance with al-Ma'mun of the Abbasid Caliphate, having himself crowned as emperor by the iconodule Greek Patriarch of Antioch, Job, in the Church of Cassian, then in Abbasid territory, taking the imperial name \"Constantine\". Having amassed a large army, perhaps of 80,000 men as some sources report, Thomas marched into Thrace, winning the support of the theme as well as the Armeniacs and Chaldians. He besieged the capital in December 821. Although Thomas did not win over all the Anatolian themes, he secured the support of the naval theme and their ships, allowing him to intensify his siege of Constantinople. At this point, Michael's usurpation was prevented only by the Walls of Constantinople.\nIn summer 822, the imperial fleet was able to destroy the rebel fleet with Greek fire. The primary sources disagree over whether a large Bulgar force under Khan Omurtag of Bulgaria was acting on Michael's request or of its own accord, nevertheless in spring 823 it marched against Thomas, forcing him to lift his siege of Constantinople. The Bulgars defeated Thomas and many of his men began to desert, leading him to retreat to Arcadiopolis. Michael besieged Thomas in Arcadiopolis and starved him out, leading his supporters to hand him over to the Emperor, who put him to death. The last outbreak of resistance was put down in Anatolia in spring 824. By the end of 823, Michael's power was firmly established and he had negotiated peace with the Bulgars despite their raiding and pillaging in Thrace during Thomas' revolt.\nAftermath.\nThe warfare damaged the rural economy, in particular the region around Constantinople, and many Dalmatian coastal towns cast off imperial authority, which was not reinstated until the reign of Basil I (r.\u2009867\u00a0\u2013\u00a0886). Michael tried to reunite the Empire by pardoning many of Thomas' supporters and marrying the daughter of Constantine VI and Maria of Amnia, Euphrosyne, of the illustrious iconoclast Isaurian dynasty, although she herself was an iconodule. The marriage thus gave Michael's rule a degree of legitimacy, but it caused some outrage since his first wife, Thekla had only recently died, and Euphrosyne was a nun. Nevertheless, the marriage helped to stabilise his authority and position.\nMichael attempted a reconciliation of the iconoclast controversy with Theodore and Nikephoros but they remained determined in their rejection of any compromise between iconoclasm and iconodulia. Theodore insisted that the matter should be resolved by a council presided over by Nikephoros or by the pope as a final arbiter. Nikephoros wrote his \"Refutation\" of the \"Acts\" of the 815 Council of Constantinople. Michael denied that the pope had any authority to intervene in the Eastern Church, so when the abbot Methodios, later Patriarch of Constantinople, arrived in Constantinople with a definition of orthodoxy from Pope Paschal I, he was considered a traitor and imprisoned. This was the only case of oppression of iconodules by Michael recorded in primary sources, and he generally pursued a benevolent policy, hoping he would be able to convert iconodules through dialogue. He wrote to the Carolingian Emperor, Louis the Pious (r.\u2009814\u00a0\u2013\u00a0840), defending the iconoclast position as represented in the synod of 815, and affirming belief in the veneration of relics. He gave an account of Thomas the Slav's revolt and appealed to Louis to suppress eastern monks who were spreading anti-Byzantine propaganda in Rome. He also expressed his disapproval of certain practices associated with iconodules including the mixing of fragments of icons with the Eucharist, the use of icons as altar tables and as sponsors in baptism or tonsuring. This is corroborated by other reports of the extensive cult of images which had developed by the ninth century. Another case of Byzantine diplomacy with the Franks was the gift of the manuscript of Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite to Louis' court in 827, which was purposefully chosen because Louis' adviser Hilduin, abbot of Saint-Denis, chose Dionysius as his abbey's patron saint.\nCampaigns against the Arabs.\nIn 824, Michael sent a fleet to raid the Syrian coast and sack Sozopetra. Caliph al-Ma'mun mounted a combined land and naval raid in 825, but it did not cause much long-term damage and Michael did not retaliate, leaving the eastern frontier in a hostile stalemate.\nMichael inherited a seriously weakened military and was unable to prevent the conquest of Crete in 826 by 10,000 Arab pirates from al-Andalus (who had 40 ships), or to recover the island with an expedition. The pirates had been exiled by the Umayyad emir of al-Andalus and captured Alexandria in 825 but were driven out. Crete was only recovered in 961, and until then remained a base for raiding parties into the Aegean and eastern Mediterranean. In 828, the Cibyrrhaeot navy and army achieved some successes, but was destroyed in a surprise attack and the \"strat\u0113gos\" of the theme was killed. However in 829, the imperial fleet succeeded in driving the pirates out of the Cyclades.\nSicily lacked both a dominant political and culture centre, like Ravenna, Rome or Naples, and an autonomous local military elite, so its population were either divided or reacted passively during the crises of the 820s. Discontent began with the revolt of Thomas the Slav, and developed with Michael's attempt to raise taxation in 826. An anti-imperial faction arose, led by the \"tourmarch\u0113s\" of Sicily, Euphemios, who had led successful raids in North Africa. In 827, the \"strat\u0113gos\" Constantine tried to arrest him, although his motive was unclear. It was likely in response to Euphemios' disloyalty, but later legends report that he wanted to punish Euphemios for abducting his niece from a nunnery and forcing her into marriage. In any event, word of Constantine's intention reached Euphemios when he was raiding on the North African shore, and caused him to initiate a rebellion, seizing Syracuse, proclaiming himself emperor and then killing the \"strat\u0113gos\" Constantine after defeating him at Catania. Some of Euphemios' supporters deserted him for the imperial government, and he was defeated by another garrison commander, which forced him to flee to the Aghlabid emir, Ziyadat Allah I of Ifriqiya, who recognised his title and gave him a fleet. In June 827, a predominantly Arab force landed on the west of the island at Mazara, beginning an invasion. The Byzantines fared poorly at first, retaining control only of a few strongholds and Syracuse. With the death of Euphemios and the arrival of a new \"strat\u0113gos\" in 829 came a series of successes which secured imperial authority by the end of Michael's reign.\nLater years.\nMichael maintained his policy of compromise and neutrality between iconoclasm and iconodulia until his death, and was supported throughout by Patriarch Antony. In October 829, Michael ordered the release of prisoners, reflecting his moderate policy. On 2 October, he died from kidney failure. He was succeeded peacefully by his son Theophilos and Theophilos's stepmother Euphrosyne, since Theophilos was only seventeen years old.\nAssessment and legacy.\nBecause of his iconoclasm, Michael was not popular among the clergy, who depicted him as an ignorant and poorly educated peasant, but he was a competent statesman and administrator. Empress Theodora (r.\u2009842\u00a0\u2013\u00a0856) defended her husband Theophilos, which mitigated the \"damnatio memoriae\" against him and his father Michael, nevertheless the later iconodule sources were highly critical of them. The civil war, which was the most ferocious since the Heraclian revolt (608\u2013610), gravely weakened the imperial government, which saw the beginning of the century-long struggle over Sicily with the Aghlabids and the loss of Crete to Arab pirates from al-Andalus. Both islands became bases for future raids of the coasts of southern Italy and in the Aegean, as well as the conquest of Bari in 842. However, by the end of Michael's reign he had begun a restoration of the Byzantine military. The system of government and military built by Michael enabled the Empire under his grandson Michael III to gain ascendancy in their struggles with the Abbasids and to withstand all the vicissitudes of Byzantine palace life. Michael II's direct descendants, the Amorian dynasty followed by the so-called Macedonian dynasty, ruled the Empire for more than two centuries, inaugurating the Byzantine Renaissance of the 9th and 10th centuries.\nAlthough he arranged the assassination of Leo V, Michael continued with his form of iconoclasm in what came to be known as the \"second\" Byzantine iconoclasm. This iconoclasm was less intransigent than the first; iconodules were not accused of idolatry and images that were suspended high up (and thus unable to be venerated) were permitted to remain in churches. Nevertheless, many iconodule clergymen remained staunchly opposed, especially Patriarch Nikephoros I of Constantinople who was deposed by Leo V but remained active in polemics against imperial authority during Michael's reign.\nFootnotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He caught the eye of the empress Zo\u00eb Porphyrogenita and they began a tempestuous and flagrant affair. It is believed that they conspired to murder her husband, Emperor Romanos III Argyros, who died in 1034. Michael and Zo\u00eb were married the same day and Michael was crowned emperor the day after.\nMichael, handsome and energetic, had poor health and entrusted most of the business of government to his brother. He distrusted Zo\u00eb and went to lengths to ensure that he did not suffer the same fate as his predecessor. The fortunes of the Empire under Michael's reign were mixed. His most triumphant moment came in 1041 when he led the imperial army against Bulgarian rebels. He returned from this victory, but died a few months later.\nEarly life and career.\nMichael came from a family of Greek peasants from Paphlagonia. He worked in Constantinople as a money changer, and was rumored to have a secret second occupation as a counterfeiter of coins. One of Michael's brothers, John the Orphanotrophos, also known as John the Eunuch, was the \"parakoimomenos\", a senior courtier who presided over the women's quarters at the imperial palace. John obtained jobs for several of his younger brothers in the court.\nRomanos Argyros became emperor of the Byzantine Empire as Romanos III in 1028. \"As a ruler he had no ability whatsoever\", and his private life was troubled by his failure to conceive a child with his wife Empress Zo\u00eb. The couple became alienated, with Romanos taking a mistress and Zo\u00eb engaging in a number of affairs. She was enamoured of the handsome young Michael to the extent of flaunting him openly and speaking of making him emperor. Romanos confronted Michael, who denied the accusations, swearing his innocence on holy relics. His suspicions assuaged, Romanos allowed Michael to become his personal servant in 1033.\nRomanos became ill in early 1034, and it was widely believed that Zo\u00eb and Michael had poisoned him. On 11 April Romanos was found dying in his bath. According to court official and later chronicler Michael Psellus, some of his retinue had \"held his head for a long time beneath the water, attempting at the same time to strangle him\". John Scylitzes writes as a simple fact that Romanos was drowned on Michael's orders. Matthew of Edessa's account has Zo\u00eb poisoning Romanos. Zo\u00eb and Michael were married on the day that Romanos III died. The next day the couple summoned the Patriarch Alexios I to officiate at the coronation of the new emperor. Alexios refused to co-operate until the payment of 50 pounds of gold helped change his mind. He crowned Michael as the new Emperor of the Romans as Michael IV.\nReign.\nDomestic policies.\nMichael IV was handsome, clever and generous, but epilepsy and a lack of education prevented him from assuming many of his imperial duties. He was initially reliant on others to direct the government in his name, and afforded significant responsibilities to his brother John, who had already become an influential minister under Constantine\u00a0VIII and Romanos\u00a0III. Zo\u00eb was disappointed in her hopes that Michael would prove a more devoted husband than Romanos. Fearing that the empress might turn on him as she had turned on his predecessor, Michael excluded her from politics and confined her to the palace \"gynaeceum\" (women's quarters). There a watch was kept on Zo\u00eb\u2019s activities, and Michael seldom visited her.\nJohn's reforms of the army and financial system revived the strength of the Empire against its foreign enemies but increased taxes, which caused discontent among the nobility and the commons. John's monopoly of the government and the introduction of such taxes as the \"Aerikon\" led to several conspiracies against him and Michael. Poor harvests and famine caused by bad weather and by a locust plague in 1035 exacerbated discontent. When Michael tried to exercise a measure of control over Aleppo, the local citizens drove off the imperial governor. There were revolts at Antioch, Nicopolis and in Bulgaria.\nIn 1034 Michael ordered the arrest of Constantine Dalassenos on suspicion of treason, accused of fomenting insurrection at Antioch. In 1037 Zo\u00eb conspired to have John the Eunuch poisoned. In 1038 Michael's brother, Constantine, suppressed an uprising of the armies in Anatolia. In 1040 a conspiracy involved the priest Michael Keroularios, who became a monk to save his life and was elected Patriarch of Constantinople under Michael's successor. During the Bulgarian uprising of 1040, John the Eunuch arrested suspected plotters in Anatolia and Constantinople who were hoping to take advantage of the turmoil but was unable to capture the Strategos (military governor) of Theodosiopolis, who joined the rebellion and attempted to capture Thessalonica.\nForeign and military affairs.\nIn terms of military affairs, Michael's reign began poorly. The Arabs sacked Myra, the Serbs threw off Byzantine authority and the Pechenegs raided almost at will up to the gates of Thessalonica. The situation was soon stabilised: on the eastern frontier, Arab pirates were either captured or killed; the Byzantines captured the Muslim fortress of Perkri, on the eastern shore of Lake Van; Edessa was relieved after a long siege and eventually ceded to the empire in 1037.\nOn the western front, Michael and John ordered the general George Maniakes to conquer the Emirate of Sicily. In 1038 Maniakes landed in southern Italy and soon captured Messina. He then defeated the scattered Arab forces and captured towns in the west and south of the island. By 1040 he had stormed and taken Syracuse. He almost succeeded in driving the Arabs from the island, but Maniakes then fell out with his Lombard allies, while his Norman mercenaries, unhappy with their pay, abandoned the Byzantine general and raised a revolt on the Italian mainland, resulting in the temporary loss of Bari. Maniakes was about to strike against them when he was recalled by John the Eunuch on suspicion of conspiracy. After Maniakes's recall, most of the Sicilian conquests were lost and an expedition against the Normans suffered several defeats, although Bari was eventually recaptured.\nIn the north, Pecheneg pressure had initially forced the Serbs to seek the protection of the Byzantine Empire and acknowledge Byzantine authority. In 1040 the Serbs again revolted, as did the Bulgarians. This uprising was partly caused by the heavy taxation in coin (and not, as before, in kind) imposed on Bulgaria by John's policies. It also aimed at the restoration of the Bulgarian state under the leadership of Peter Delyan. The rebels seized Belgrade, proclaimed Delyan Emperor of Bulgaria and then quickly took Scupi. Michael\u00a0IV made things worse by removing from command the \"doux\" of Dyrrhachium, who had been marching against Peter Delyan, accusing him of a conspiracy. His troops, largely Bulgarian, joined the revolt and Delyan laid siege to Thessalonica. Dyrrhachium had been lost and Delyan defeated the \"Strategos\" of Hellas. Most of the theme of Nicopolis had risen up against Michael, disgusted with the greed of John the Eunuch.\nAt this point, Michael's epilepsy left him half paralysed and he developed a severe case of dropsy, which caused his legs to become gangrenous. When he announced that he intended to lead the imperial army against the Bulgarians, his advisors were aghast. In 1041 Michael set off towards Macedonia with an army of 40,000 men, assisted by Norse mercenaries, including the future King Harald III of Norway. Gathering his forces at Mosynopolis the Emperor waited for the Bulgarian army. The military position of the Byzantines was aided by internal dissension among the Bulgarians. Michael advanced, relieving Thessalonica then bringing the Bulgarians to battle, defeating them and capturing Delyan. Michael pushed his army aggressively into Bulgaria. The largest remaining Bulgarian contingent was at Prilapon in a fortified camp commanded by Manuel Ivats. The Byzantines stormed the camp, scattered the Bulgarians and captured Ivats. The rigours of the campaign brought Michael close to death, but he was able to return to Constantinople in triumph.\nFinal illness and death.\nDespite his triumphant campaign, it was now clear to all that Michael was dying. He sought heavenly aid by visiting the shrine of Saint Demetrius at Thessalonica and by building or rebuilding churches. In 1039 he gave monetary gifts to every monk and priest in the empire and also to any parents who made him a godfather to their children. John the Eunuch, eager to ensure that power remained in his hands, forced Zo\u00eb to adopt Michael's and his nephew, their sister's son, also named Michael. After taking Holy Orders, on 10 December 1041 Michael IV died, refusing to the last to see his wife, who begged that she be allowed to visit him one more time. His nephew was crowned emperor as Michael V.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\nPrimary\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSecondary"}

He was the nephew and successor of Michael IV and the adoptive son of Michael IV's wife Empress Zoe. He was popularly called \"the Caulker\" (\"Kalaphates\") in accordance with his father's original occupation.\nNephew of Michael IV, whose sister Maria had married a caulker named Stephen, Michael showed no gratitude either toward Empress Zo\u00eb, who had adopted him, or toward his uncle John the Orphanotrophos, at whose suggestion he owed the throne. A reformer, despised because of his humble origins, Michael V abolished the privileges of the court aristocracy and sought to carry out a deep reform of the administration. After feigning the greatest respect toward his two benefactors, he had them exiled on the advice of his uncle Constantine. But while the exile of John the Orphanotrophos\u2014hated for the heavy tax burden he had imposed on the people\u2014provoked no reaction, that of Empress Zo\u00eb, the last surviving member with her sister Theodora of the strongly legitimate Macedonian dynasty, triggered a revolution. Michael and his uncle Constantine had to flee Constantinople to seek refuge in the Monastery of Stoudios, where, caught by the crowd, they had their eyes gouged out and were confined to two different monasteries on April 21, 1042. His downfall, recounted in detail by the chroniclers of the time, illustrates the influence of the capital\u2019s population on Byzantine political affairs in the 11th century.\nFamily.\nMichael V was the son of a couple named Stephen and Maria. His birth date is not known, but is sometimes given as c. 1015, probably because he was considered \"young\" in 1035. Michael's mother was a sister of the Byzantine emperor Michael IV, and Stephen had been a caulker before becoming an admiral under Michael IV and then botching an expedition to Sicily. Although the emperor preferred another of his nephews, the future Michael V was advanced as heir to the throne by his other uncle John the Orphanotrophos and the Empress Zoe. In 1035, Michael\u00a0IV granted him the title of \"kaisar\" (caesar), and, together with Zoe, adopted his nephew as a son. Michael IV died on 10 December 1041 and Michael V was proclaimed emperor three days later by Zoe.\nReign.\nDetermined to rule on his own, Michael V came into conflict with his uncle John the Orphanotrophos, whom he almost immediately banished to a monastery. Michael now reversed his uncle's decisions, recalling the nobles and courtiers who had been exiled during the previous reign, including the future patriarch Michael Keroularios and the general George Maniakes. Maniakes was promptly sent back to Southern Italy in order to contain the advance of the Normans.\nOn the night of 18 April to 19 April 1042, Michael V banished his adoptive mother and co-ruler Zoe, for plotting to poison him, to the island of Principo, thus becoming sole emperor. His announcement of the event in the morning led to a popular revolt; the palace was surrounded by a mob demanding Zoe's immediate restoration. The demand was met, and Zoe was brought back, though still in a nun's habit. Presenting Zoe to the crowds in the Hippodrome did not quell the public's outrage over Michael's actions. The masses attacked the palace from multiple directions. The emperor's soldiers attempted to fight them off and by April 21, an estimated three thousand people from both sides had died. Once inside the palace, the mob pillaged valuables and tore up the tax rolls. Also on 21 April 1042 Zoe's sister Theodora, who had been removed from her nunnery against her will earlier in the uprising, was declared Empress. In response, Michael fled to seek safety in the monastery of the Stoudion together with his remaining uncle, Constantine. Although he had taken monastic vows, Michael was arrested, blinded and sent to a monastery by then-Chief of the Varangian Guard, Harald Hardrada.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Scott as Dr. Herbert Bock. It was written by Paddy Chayefsky, who was awarded the 1972 Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay. Chayefsky also narrates the film and was one of the producers; he had complete control over the casting and content of the film.\nIn 1995, \"The Hospital\" was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry as being deemed \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".\nPlot.\nAt a Manhattan teaching hospital, the life of Dr. Bock, the Chief of Medicine, is in disarray: he has left his wife, his children don't talk to him, and his once-beloved teaching hospital is falling apart.\nThe hospital is dealing with the sudden deaths of two doctors and a nurse. These are attributed to coincidental or unavoidable failures to provide accurate treatment.\nAt the same time, administrators must deal with a protest against the hospital's annexation of an adjacent and decrepit apartment building. The annexation is to be used for a drug rehabilitation center; the building's current occupants demand that the hospital find them replacement housing before the building is demolished despite the building being condemned sometime before.\nDr. Bock admits to impotence and has thoughts of suicide, but falls in love with Barbara Drummond, a patient's daughter who came with her father from Mexico for his treatment. This temporarily gives Dr. Bock something to live for, after Barbara challenges and engages with him.\nThe deaths are discovered to have been caused by Barbara's father as retribution for the \"inhumanity\" of modern medical treatment. Drummond takes no personal responsibility, claiming his victims would have been saved if they had received prompt, appropriate treatment, but they did not. Dr. Bock and Barbara use a final, accidental death of a doctor at the hospital to cover Drummond's misdeeds. Barbara makes plans to fly with her father back to Mexico. Dr. Bock at first intends to go with them, but at the last minute, driven by his sense of obligation, he insists on staying behind at the hospital so that it will not descend into total chaos.\nCast.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;* George C. Scott as Dr. Herbert \"Herb\" Bock\nProduction.\nIt was filmed at Metropolitan Hospital Center in New York. Frank Thompson designed the costumes for the film.\nReception.\nBox office.\nThe film earned $9 million in North American rentals.\nCritical response.\nWhen \"The Hospital\" was released, film critic Roger Ebert lauded the film, writing, \"\"The Hospital\" is a better movie than you may have been led to believe. It has been criticized for switching tone in midstream, but maybe it's only heading for deeper, swifter waters. [...] Chayevsky's [\"sic\"] bizarre and unexpected ending suggests that men\u2014even madmen\u2014can still use institutions for their own private purpose.\"\nWriting in \"The New York Times\", Vincent Canby found the film \u201ca very serious (in fact, perhaps, a little too serious), very funny melodramatic farce\u00a0... [it] is not, as you might be led to believe, the sort of pious, inside-institution literature that Arthur Hailey grinds out to satisfy the book clubs, if not the muses, nor is it really one of those malpractice horror stores that are so helpful in obtaining lecture tours for medical men\u00a0... the writer\u2019s intelligence, and his only recently exercised gift for fantasy\u00a0... save \u2018The Hospital\u2019 from a couple of serious seizures that, toward the end, overtake the movie when it feels called upon to certify its serious purposes and to straighten out its peculiar plot\u00a0... Mr. Hiller\u00a0... obtains excellent performances from his stars [and] has perfectly cast the film down to roles that are so small they depend\u2014I suspect\u2014as much on natural mannerism as on acting talent.\u201d\nMore recently, film critic Dennis Schwartz gave the film a mildly positive review, writing, \"The gallows humor was the melodramatic farce's saving grace; the film uses its razor-sharp instruments to cut into the hides of the insensitive institutionalized health care providers like Michael Moore's \"Sicko\" does in 2007 to the fat-cat HMOs. My major gripe was that it could have been better, as Chayefsky delivered his part of the bargain and so did Scott; nevertheless the pic flattens out as the director increasingly loses his way in all the bitterness and invented horror stories and leaves us dangling over how to get out of such an irredeemable world (where modern man is perceived as forgotten in death).\" Pauline Kael wrote: \"That great spangled ham George C. Scott in Paddy Chayefsky's farce about the killing incompetence in a modern big-city hospital.

He had formerly served as a military finance minister (\"logothetes tou stratiotikou\", hence the epithet \"Stratiotikos\"). Michael Bringas was chosen for his pliability by the empress Theodora as her successor shortly before her death on 31 August 1056. The appointment had been secured through the influence of Leo Paraspondylos, Theodora's most trusted adviser, who remained chief minister.\nAlthough Michael managed to survive a conspiracy organized by Theodosios, a nephew of the former emperor Constantine\u00a0IX Monomachos, he was faced with the disaffection of the military aristocracy. His most costly error was to ignore the perceived rights of the general Nikephoros Bryennios, who had been demoted and reduced to poverty after falling out with the Empress Theodora; Michael restored Bryennios's military rank, but not his confiscated wealth and estates. Michael compounded his error by rebuffing Bryennios after he had already ordered the restored general to lead a division of 3,000 men to reinforce the army in Cappadocia. From here Bryennios began plotting to overthrow Michael\u00a0VI, and it was his capture that precipitated the military nobility to rally around the general Isaac Komnenos, who was proclaimed emperor in Paphlagonia on 8 June 1057.\nSoon after, the government's army was routed at the Battle of Petroe (20 August 1057) near Nicaea, and Isaac Komnenos advanced on Constantinople. Michael\u00a0VI attempted to negotiate with the rebels through the famous courtier Michael Psellos, offering to adopt Isaac as his son and to grant him the title of \"kaisar\" (caesar), but his proposals were publicly rejected. Privately Isaac showed himself more open to negotiation, and he was promised the status of co-emperor. However, during the course of these secret negotiations, a riot in favor of Isaac broke out in Constantinople. Patriarch Michael Keroularios convinced Michael\u00a0VI to abdicate in Isaac's favor on 30 August 1057. The emperor duly followed the patriarch's advice and became a monk. He retired to his private home and died there shortly thereafter.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "74384", "revid": "38001712", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=74384", "title": "Morgan Stanley", "text": "American financial services company\nMorgan Stanley is an American multinational investment bank and financial services company headquartered at 1585 Broadway in Midtown Manhattan, New York City. With offices in 42 countries and more than 80,000 employees, the firm's clients include corporations, governments, institutions, and individuals. Morgan Stanley ranked No. 61 in the 2023 Fortune 500 list of the largest United States corporations by total revenue and in the same year ranked No. 30 in the Forbes Global 2000.\nThe original Morgan Stanley, formed by J.P. Morgan &amp; Co. partners Henry Sturgis Morgan (a grandson of J.P. Morgan), Harold Stanley, and others, came into existence on September 16, 1935, in response to the Glass\u2013Steagall Act, which required the splitting of American commercial and investment banking businesses. In its first year, the company operated with a 24% market share (US$1.1\u00a0billion) in public offerings and private placements.\nThe current Morgan Stanley is the result of the merger of the original Morgan Stanley with Dean Witter Discover &amp; Co. in 1997. Dean Witter's chairman and CEO, Philip J. Purcell, became the chairman and CEO of the newly merged Morgan Stanley Dean Witter Discover &amp; Co. The new firm changed its name back to \"Morgan Stanley\" in 2001. The main areas of business for the firm today are institutional securities, wealth management and investment management. The bank is considered systemically important by the Financial Stability Board.\nThe company operates in three business segments: Institutional Securities, Wealth Management, and Investment Management.\nHistory.\nEarly years (1935\u20131997).\nMorgan Stanley traces its roots to J.P. Morgan &amp; Co. After the U.S. Congress passed the Glass\u2013Steagall Act in 1933, it was no longer possible for a corporation to have investment banking and commercial banking businesses under a single holding entity. J.P. Morgan &amp; Co. chose the commercial banking business over the investment banking business. As a result, some of the employees of J.P. Morgan &amp; Co., most notably Henry S. Morgan and Harold Stanley, left J.P. Morgan &amp; Co. and joined others from the Drexel partners to form Morgan Stanley. The firm formally opened its doors for business on September 16, 1935, at 2 Wall Street, New York City, just down the street from J.P. Morgan. The firm was involved with the distribution of 1938 US$100\u00a0million (~$ in 2024) of debentures for the United States Steel Corporation as the lead underwriter. The firm also obtained the distinction of being the lead syndicate in the 1939 U.S. rail financing. The firm went through a reorganization in 1941 to allow for more activity in its securities business.\nThe firm was led by Perry Hall, the last founder to lead Morgan Stanley, from 1951 until 1961. During this period, the firm co-managed the World Bank's triple-A-rated bonds offering of 1952, as well as coming up with General Motors' US$300\u00a0million debt issue, US$231\u00a0million IBM stock offering, and the US$250\u00a0million AT&amp;T's debt offering.\nMorgan Stanley credits itself with having created the first viable computer model for financial analysis in 1962, thereby starting a new trend in the field of financial analysis. Future president and chairman Dick Fisher contributed to the computer model as a young employee, learning the Fortran and COBOL programming languages at IBM. In 1967, it established the Morgan &amp; Cie, International in Paris in an attempt to enter the European securities market. The firm acquired Brooks, Harvey &amp; Co., Inc. in 1967 and established a presence in the real estate business. The sales and trading business is believed to be the brainchild of Bob Baldwin.\nIn 1996, Morgan Stanley acquired Van Kampen American Capital.\nAfter the merger (since 1997).\nOn February 5, 1997, the company merged with Dean Witter Discover &amp; Co., the spun-off financial services business of Sears Roebuck. Dean Witter's chairman and CEO, Philip J. Purcell, continued to hold the same roles in the newly merged \"Morgan Stanley Dean Witter Discover &amp; Co.\" Morgan Stanley's president John J. Mack became the firm's president and chief operating officer. In 1998, the name of the firm was changed to \"Morgan Stanley Dean Witter &amp; Co.\" Originally, the name was chosen to be the combination of the two predecessor companies to avoid tension between the two firms. Eventually, in 2001 \"Dean Witter\" was further dropped and the name became \"Morgan Stanley\" for unrevealed reasons. The merged firm began expanding overseas operations: in 1999, Mack set up a joint venture in India with local partner JM Financial.\nMorgan Stanley had offices located on 35 floors across buildings 1, 2, and 5 of the World Trade Center, and was the largest tenant of the WTC complex. Most of these offices had been inherited from Dean Witter which had occupied the space since the mid-1980s. The firm lost 13 employees during the September 11 attacks in 2001 (Thomas F. Swift, Wesley Mercer, Jennifer de Jesus, Joseph DiPilato, Nolbert Salomon, Godwin Forde, Steve R. Strauss, Lindsay C. Herkness, Albert Joseph, Jorge Velazquez, Titus Davidson, Charles Laurencin and Security Director Rick Rescorla) in the towers, while 2,687 were successfully evacuated by Rick Rescorla. The surviving employees moved to temporary headquarters in the vicinity. In 2005 Morgan Stanley moved 2,300 of its employees back to lower Manhattan, at that time the largest such move.\nIn 2003, New York\u2013Presbyterian Hospital named the Morgan Stanley Children's Hospital in recognition of the firm's sponsorship of the hospital, which largely funded its construction through philanthropy. The initiative began under CEO Philip J. Purcell and was completed under John Mack. Employees at the firm have been involved with the hospital since the 1990s and personally donated to the construction of the current child-friendly building, which opened in November 2003.\nThe company found itself in the midst of a management crisis starting in March 2005 that resulted in a loss of the firm's staff. Purcell resigned as CEO of Morgan Stanley in June 2005 when a highly public campaign by former Morgan Stanley partners threatened to damage the firm and challenged his refusal to aggressively increase leverage, increase risk, enter the sub-prime mortgage business and make expensive acquisitions; the same strategies that forced Morgan Stanley into massive write-downs, related to the subprime mortgage crisis, by 2007.\nOn December 19, 2006, Morgan Stanley announced the spin-off of its Discover Card unit. The bank completed the spinoff of Discover Financial on June 30, 2007.\nIn February 2007, Morgan Stanley announced the end of its Indian joint venture: the bank acquired its local partner's stake in the institutional brokerage business, and sold its own stake in the other businesses. The bank then set up a wholly owned subsidiary; the country head of Investment Management, Narayan Ramachandran, became CEO of the new subsidiary. Aisha de Sequeira, a managing director in the Mergers and Acquisitions group, was made Head of Investment Banking.\nTo cope with the write-downs during the subprime mortgage crisis, Morgan Stanley announced on December 19, 2007, that it would receive a US$5\u00a0billion capital infusion from the China Investment Corporation in exchange for securities that would be convertible to 9.9% of its shares in 2010.\nThe bank's Process Driven Trading unit was among several on Wall Street caught in a short squeeze, reportedly losing nearly $300\u00a0million in one day. The bubble's subsequent collapse was considered to be a central component of the 2008 financial crisis.\nThe bank was contracted by the United States Treasury in August 2008 to advise the government on potential rescue strategies for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Within days, Morgan Stanley itself was at risk of failure, with rapidly changing prospects, regulatory model and ownership stakes over the course of four weeks from mid-September to mid-October 2008.\nThe bank Morgan Stanley was reported to have lost over 80% of its market value during the 2008 financial crisis. On September 17, 2008, the British evening-news analysis program \"Newsnight\" reported that Morgan Stanley was facing difficulties after a 42% slide in its share price in two days. CEO John J. Mack wrote in a memo to staff \"we're in the midst of a market controlled by fear and rumours and short-sellers are driving our stock down.\" By September 19, 2008, the share price had slid 57% in four days, and the company was said to have explored merger possibilities with CITIC, Wachovia, HSBC, Standard Chartered, Banco Santander and Nomura. At one point, Hank Paulson offered Morgan Stanley to JPMorgan Chase at no cost, but JPMorgan's Jamie Dimon refused the offer.\nMorgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs, the last two major investment banks in the US, both announced on September 22, 2008, that they would become traditional bank holding companies regulated by the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve's approval of their bid to become banks ended the ascendancy of securities firms, 75 years after Congress separated them from deposit-taking lenders, and capped weeks of chaos that sent Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. into bankruptcy and led to the rushed sale of Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. to Bank of America Corp.\nMUFG Bank, Japan's largest bank, invested $9\u00a0billion in a direct purchase of a 21% ownership stake in Morgan Stanley on September 29, 2008. The payment from MUFG was supposed to be wired electronically; however, because it needed to be made on an emergency basis on Columbus Day when banks were closed in the US, MUFG cut a US$9\u00a0billion physical check, the largest amount written via physical check at the time.

He was known as incompetent as an emperor and reliant on court officials, especially of his finance minister Nikephoritzes, who increased taxation and luxury spending while not properly financing their army (which later mutinied). Under his reign, Bari was lost and his empire faced open revolt in the Balkans. Along with the advancing Seljuk Turks in the eastern front, Michael also had to contend with his mercenaries openly turning against the empire. Michael stepped down as emperor in 1078 and later retired to a monastery.\nLife.\nMichael VII was born c. 1050 in Constantinople, the eldest son of Constantine X Doukas and Eudokia Makrembolitissa. He was probably associated with the throne by the end of 1060, together with or shortly before his newly born brother Konstantios Doukas. When Constantine X died on 23 May 1067, Michael VII was already 17 years old and should have been able to rule by himself. He exhibited little interest in politics, however, and his mother Eudokia and uncle John Doukas governed the empire as effective regents.\nOn 1 January 1068, Eudokia married the general Romanos IV Diogenes, who now became senior co-emperor alongside Michael VII, Konstantios, and another brother, Andronikos. When Romanos\u00a0IV was defeated and captured by Alp Arslan of the Seljuk Turks at the Battle of Manzikert in August 1071, Michael\u00a0VII remained in the background, while the initiative to take power was taken by his uncle John Doukas and his tutor Michael Psellos. Michael\u00a0VII was proclaimed emperor on c. 1 October 1071, although Eudokia co-ruled with Michael\u00a0VII for a month before being dispatched to a monastery.\nAlthough still advised by Michael Psellos and John Doukas, Michael\u00a0VII became increasingly reliant on his finance minister Nikephoritzes. The emperor's chief interests, shaped by Psellos, were in academic pursuits, and he allowed Nikephoritzes to increase both taxation and luxury spending without properly financing the army. As an emperor he was incompetent, often surrounded by sycophantic court officials. In dire straits, imperial officials resorted to property confiscations and even expropriated some of the wealth of the church. The underpaid army tended to mutiny, and the Byzantines lost Bari, their last possession in Italy, to the Normans of Robert Guiscard in 1071. Simultaneously, they faced a serious revolt under Georgi Voyteh in the Balkans, where they faced an attempt at the restoration of the Bulgarian state. Although this revolt was suppressed by the general Nikephoros Bryennios, the Byzantine Empire was unable to recover its losses in Asia Minor.\nAfter Manzikert, the Byzantine government sent a new army to contain the Seljuk Turks under Isaac Komnenos, a brother of the future emperor Alexios\u00a0I Komnenos, but this army was defeated and its commander captured in 1073. The problem was made worse by the desertion of the Byzantines' western mercenaries under Roussel de Bailleul who were setting up an independent principiality in the region of Galatia and Lycaonia. They became the object of the next military expedition in the area, led by Michael's uncle, \"caesar\" John Doukas. This campaign also ended in failure, and John was likewise captured by the enemy. The victorious Roussel now forced John Doukas to stand as pretender to the throne and sacked Chrysopolis, just opposite Constantinople. A new army under Alexios Komnenos (the future emperor), reinforced by Seljuk troops sent by Malik Shah\u00a0I, finally defeated the mercenaries and captured John Doukas in 1074.\nThese misfortunes caused widespread dissatisfaction, exacerbated by the devaluation of the currency, which gave the emperor his nickname \"Parapinak\u0113s.\" In 1078 two generals, Nikephoros Bryennios and Nikephoros Botaneiates, simultaneously revolted in the Balkans and Anatolia, respectively. Botaneiates gained the support of the Seljuk Turks, and he reached Constantinople first. Michael\u00a0VII resigned the throne with hardly a struggle on 24 or 31 March 1078 and retired into the Monastery of Stoudios. He later became metropolitan of Ephesus and died in Constantinople in c. 1090.\nBefore his resignation from the throne, Michael\u00a0VII may have sent an embassy to Song China, following a series of Byzantine embassies to the earlier Tang Empire of China. From the \"Wenxian Tongkao\", written by Chinese historian Ma Duanlin (1245\u20131322), and the 14th century work the \"History of Song,\" it is known that the ruler \"Mie-li-yi-ling-kai-sa\" (\u6ec5\u529b\u4f0a\u9748\u6539\u6492) of \"Fu-lin\" (i.e. Byzantium) sent an embassy to the Song dynasty which arrived on November 1081, during the reign of Emperor Shenzong of Song (r. 1067\u20131085). The \"History of Song\" mentions how the Byzantine diplomat and official named \"Ni-si-tu-ling-si-meng-p'an\" offered saddled horses, sword-blades, and real pearls as tributary gifts to the Song court.\nUsurpers.\nVarious usurpers attempted to overthrow Michael\u00a0VII or rule parts of the empire. These included:\nFamily.\nMichael\u00a0VII Doukas married Maria of Alania, daughter of King Bagrat\u00a0IV of Georgia. By her he had at least one son, Constantine Doukas, co-emperor from c. 1075 to 1078 and from 1081 to 1087/8. He died c. 1095.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

They are pulled through the first section on a barge and then build rafts to continue on the Ohio River. Along the journey, they meet mountain man Linus Rawlings, who is traveling to Pittsburgh to trade his furs. Rawlings and Zebulon's eldest daughter, Eve, are attracted to each other, but he is not ready to settle down.\nRawlings stops at an isolated trading post, which is actually a front run by a clan of river pirates. Linus is led into a cave, stabbed in the back, and then pushed down a hole. The pirates steal his furs and sink his canoe. Wounded, Linus follows them. When they are about to rob the Prescott party, Linus intervenes and helps the Prescotts kill all of the pirates.\nThe Prescotts continue down the river. When the lead raft is caught in rapids, Zebulon and his wife Rebecca drown; Linus arrives to help bury them. Deciding he cannot live without Eve, he asks to marry her and take her to Pittsburgh, but she insists on homesteading at the spot where her parents died.\nThe Plains (1851).\nEve's sister Lilith chooses to go back east, dreaming of becoming rich, and years later becomes a singer and dancer in St. Louis. While performing at a music hall, she attracts the attention of professional gambler Cleve van Valen, who learns that she has just inherited a California gold mine.\nOn a wagon train heading west, Lilith partners with an elderly woman named Agatha; Cleve joins them to avoid his debts and to swindle Lilith of her gold. Wagonmaster Roger Morgan and Cleve court her along the way, but she rejects them both. Surviving an arduous trek and an attack by the Cheyenne together, Lilith falls for Cleve. The pair eventually arrive at the mine, but discover that it is worthless. Cleve leaves; Lilith returns to work in a camp town's dance hall, heartbroken. Morgan finds her and again proposes marriage, to no avail.\nLater, Lilith performs on a Sacramento riverboat. By chance, Cleve is a passenger. The pair happily reunite, and Cleve proposes to her, telling her of the business opportunities waiting in San Francisco. She accepts his proposal.\nThe Civil War (1861\u20131865).\nLinus Rawlings has joined the Union army as a captain in the American Civil War. Despite Eve's wishes, their son Zeb enlists as well, seeking adventure and an escape from farming. The bloody Battle of Shiloh shows Zeb the cruel realities of war, and his father dies there.\nZeb encounters a disillusioned Confederate soldier who suggests deserting. By chance, they eavesdrop on Generals Ulysses S. Grant and William Tecumseh Sherman. The Confederate realizes he has the opportunity to shoot them, leaving Zeb no choice but to kill him. Zeb continues to serve for the rest of the war.\nWhen the war ends, Zeb returns home as a lieutenant and learns his mother died, having lost the will to live after losing Linus. Zeb gives his share of the family farm to his brother and leaves, deciding to stay in the army.\nThe Railroad (1868).\nIn the late 1860s, two competing railroad lines, the Central Pacific Railroad and the Union Pacific Railroad, open up new territories that attract American and European settlers.\nZeb serves in the U.S. Cavalry, trying to maintain peace with the Native Americans with the help of buffalo hunter Jethro Stuart, an old friend of Linus's. When railroad man Mike King violates a treaty by building on Native American territory, the Arapahos retaliate by stampeding buffalo through his camp, killing many.\nDisgusted by Mike's unchecked greed and callousness, Zeb resigns from the army, and then visits Jethro at his mountain cabin before moving on.\nThe Outlaws (1889).\nIn San Francisco, the widowed Lilith auctions off her possessions to pay off debts. She travels to Arizona, inviting Zeb and his family to oversee a cattle ranch, her last remaining asset.\nZeb (now an Arizona marshal), his wife Julie, and their children meet Lilith at Gold City's train station. There, Zeb runs into outlaw Charlie Gant. Zeb had killed Gant's brother in a gunfight. When Gant makes threats against Zeb and his family, Zeb turns to his friend, Gold City marshal Lou Ramsey. However, Gant is not wanted for anything in that territory, so Ramsey can do nothing.\nZeb suspects Gant plans to steal a train's gold shipment, and prepares an ambush with Ramsey's reluctant help. Gant and his gang are killed in the shootout and resulting train wreck. Lilith and the Rawlings family travel by wagon to their new home.\nCast.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nThe film marked then 66-year-old Raymond Massey's last appearance as Abraham Lincoln, a role that he previously played on stage (\"Abe Lincoln in Illinois\" and the stage adaptation of \"John Brown's Body\"), on screen (\"Abe Lincoln in Illinois\") and on television (\"The Day Lincoln Was Shot\", and two more productions of \"Abe Lincoln in Illinois\").\nProduction.\nDevelopment.\nMGM had enjoyed a great success with the big screen remake of \"Ben-Hur\" (1959) and initiated a number of spectacles, including remakes of \"Cimarron\", \"Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse\" and \"Mutiny on the Bounty\".\nIn 1960, MGM struck a deal to produce four films in the Cinerama process, and Bing Crosby approached the studio with a proposition. He was developing a television spectacular called \"How the West Was Won\" based on photographs of the Old West in \"Life\", with profits earmarked for St. John's Hospital, along with an album inspired by the same article recorded with Rosemary Clooney. MGM purchased the film rights from Crosby.\nMGM announced the project in June 1960, originally titled \"The Great Western Story\". The plan was to film a story of six segments featuring 12 stars, with a cohesive overall storyline. Among the historical figures to be featured were Buffalo Bill, the James brothers and Billy the Kid. St. John's Hospital president Irene Dunne and others persuaded the film's stars to accept less than their usual fees. However, the hospital later sued for a share of the film's profits.\nBernard Smith was assigned as producer, and he hired James Webb to write the script. George Peppard was announced as the lead in October 1960, and Irene Dunne and Bing Crosby were originally announced as stars. Laurence Harvey and John Wayne were also slated to appear in one sequence together. \"Filmink\" commented Peppard \"carries the last three-fifths\" of the film, adding \"if anyone is the leading man of that movie, it's him.\"\nBy April 1961, Wayne and Spencer Tracy had confirmed their plans to play Generals Sherman and Grant for a segment directed by John Ford, and James Stewart had been signed as well. Other roles would go to Gregory Peck, Debbie Reynolds, Russ Tamblyn and Carroll Baker, while Henry Hathaway and George Marshall would also direct from a script by James Webb. Crosby was scheduled to provide narration. Jim Hutton was intended to appear in the Civil War segment. Eventually, Harry Morgan appeared as Grant when Tracy was unavailable.\nUltimately, the film contained five sections: the 1830s westward migration, the 1849 California gold rush, the Civil War, the construction of the transcontinental railroad, and the \"taming\" of the Wild West, with one family's story over three generations providing the bridge between each time period. The budget was set to at least $8 million. John Ford directed the Civil War segment, George Marshall the railroad segment and Henry Hathaway the rest. \"We wanted three old pros, no young geniuses,\" said Smith.\nCinerama.\n\"How the West Was Won\" was one of only two dramatic feature films (along with \"The Wonderful World of the Brothers Grimm\") produced with the three-strip Cinerama process. Although the picture quality when projected onto curved screens in theaters is stunning, attempts to convert the film to a smaller screen suffer. When the film is projected in letterbox format, the actors' faces are nearly indistinguishable in long shots.\nShooting.\nFilming started in May 1961 by John Ford in Paducah, Kentucky. Producer Bernard Smith said, \"It is essential for our purposes that virtually the whole movie be shot outdoors. Throughout the movie, one of the basic themes is to show little people against a vast country \u2013 huge deserts, endless plains, towering mountains, broad rivers. We want to capture the spirit of adventure, the restless spirit that led these men and women across the country in [the] face of many difficulties and dangers.\"\nAfter Ford finished his segment, Hathaway took over on location. Hathaway called Ford's segment \"a little stagey\".\nParts of the film were shot in Monument Valley, Utah and in Wildwood Regional Park in Thousand Oaks, California.\nFord complained about having to dress such huge sets, as Cinerama photographed a much wider view than did the standard single-camera process to which Hollywood directors were accustomed. Director Henry Hathaway was quoted as saying, \"That Goddamned Cinerama; do you know a waist shot is as close as you can get with that thing?\"\nA more difficult problem was that filming required that the actors be artificially positioned out of dramatic and emotional frame and out of synchronization with one another. Only when the three-print Cinerama process was projected upon a Cinerama screen did the positions and emotions of the actors synchronize, such as normal eye contact or emotional harmony between actors in a dramatic sequence. Because of the nature of Cinerama, if the film were shown in flat-screen projection, it would appear as if the actors made no eye contact. One brief scene of Mexican soldiers was sourced by John Wayne from his 1960 version of \"The Alamo\".\nStuntman Bob Morgan, husband of Yvonne De Carlo, was seriously injured and lost a leg during a break in filming a gunfight on a moving train while filming the Outlaws portion. Chains holding logs on a flatbed car broke, crushing Morgan as he crouched beside them.\nIn a scene in which George Peppard's character reminisces about his late father, Peppard improvises with an imitation of James Stewart's voice. Ford initially objected, but Peppard felt that it was important in such a long, sprawling film to remind the audience which character his father was supposed to be.\nHathaway later said that making the film was \"goddam trouble. They had an idiot for a producer and Sol Siegel was drunk most of the time. We spent so much money on the picture they almost decided not to do the last part. We had a meeting, and I said, 'You can't quit. You've got to show how the West was won. The West was won when the law took over'.\"\nPost-production.\nFilming was completed in January 1962. After the film was shot, MGM ordered a new ending that resolved the family story, which caused shooting to continue for another month and included George Peppard and Debbie Reynolds. The budget eventually reached $12 million.\nFor \"The Civil War\" segment, footage from MGM's 1957 film \"Raintree County\" of the Civil War Battle of Chickamauga were used for combat scenes during the day, as the scenes with Peppard, Tamblyn, Wayne, and Morgan were all at night. A brief shot of a steamboat going down a river (seen during the end of the Plains Segment) is also used from \"Raintree County\".\nFor \"The Railroad\" segment, a subplot was cut featuring Hope Lange as Stewart's daughter, Julie, who becomes involved in a love triangle with Zeb and King; she ultimately marries and abandons Zeb.\nThe film later inspired a television series of the same name.\nMusic.\nThe film's music was composed and conducted by Alfred Newman. The soundtrack album was originally released by MGM Records. Dimitri Tiomkin, known for his Western film scores, was the first composer approached, but he became unavailable following eye surgery and Newman was hired as a replacement.\nThe score is widely considered as among Newman's best, and it appears on the AFI's 100 Years of Film Scores list. It was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Original Score, losing to the score for \"Tom Jones\".\nDebbie Reynolds sings three songs in the film: \"Raise a Ruckus Tonight\" starting a party around the camp fire, \"What Was Your Name in the States?\" and \"A Home in the Meadow\" to the tune of \"Greensleeves\", with lyrics by Sammy Cahn. Her rendition is heard by Cleve (Gregory Peck), who is so moved that he proposes marriage. This scene ends the Plains segment.\nReception.\nPremiere.\nSurprisingly for such an American film, \"How the West Was Won\" had its world premiere in the United Kingdom at London's Casino Cinerama Theatre on November 1, 1962. It had a $450,000 advance. The film ran at the Casino for 123 weeks, ending in April 1965.\nCritical reception.\nHarold Myers of \"Variety\" called it a \"magnificent and exciting spectacle\" and in relation to the Cinerama process noted that there had been \"a vast improvement in the process. The print joins are barely noticeable, and the wobble, which beset earlier productions, has been eliminated.\" Reviews from London were favorable but with reservations over the storyline. Alexander Walker of the \"Evening Standard\" called it \"a super-epic which shucks away your sophistication. If ever I heard the sound of success it is this.\" \"The Times\" said \"it has a kind of surge and splendour and extravagance not to be despised.\"\nIn 2025, \"The Hollywood Reporter\" listed \"How the West Was Won\" as having the best stunts of 1962.\nBox-office performance.\n\"How the West Was Won\" was a massive commercial success. Produced on a large budget of $15 million, it grossed $46,500,000 at the North American box office, making it the second-highest-grossing film of 1963. The film has grossed over $50 million worldwide.\nAccolades.\nThe following people won Academy Awards for their work:\nThe following were nominated for five other Academy Awards:\nThe score was ranked 25th on the American Film Institute 2005 list AFI's 100 Years of Film Scores.\nThe February 2020 issue of \"New York Magazine\" lists \"How the West Was Won\" as among \"The Best Movies That Lost Best Picture at the Oscars.\"\nRestoration.\nIn 2000, Warner Bros. assigned Crest Digital the task of restoring the original Cinerama negative for \"How the West Was Won\". As part of the process, Crest Digital built its own authentic Cinerama screening room. Hewlett-Packard has led efforts to combine the three image portions to make the Cinerama image look more acceptable on a flat screen. This has finally been accomplished on the latest DVD and Blu-ray disc release. Previously, the lines where the three Cinerama panels join were glaringly visible, but this has been largely corrected on the Warner Bros. DVD and Blu-ray releases. However, the joints remain visible in places, especially against bright backgrounds.\nThe restoration also corrects some of the geometric distortions inherent in the process. For instance, in the final shot, the Golden Gate Bridge appears to curve in perspective as the camera flies underneath it whereas in the Cinerama version, it breaks into three straight sections at different angles.\nThe Blu-ray disc also contains a \"SmileBox\" version simulating the curved-screen effect.\nThough the aspect ratio of Cinerama is 2.59:1, Warner's new releases of the film offer an aspect ratio of 2.89:1, incorporating much information on both sides that was not intended to be seen when projected. The Blu-ray-exclusive SmileBox alternative contains the intended cropping intact.\nIn 2006, Warner Bros. Motion Picture Imaging performed digital restoration on \"How the West Was Won\". The film was restored frame by frame at Prasad Corporation to remove dirt, tears, scratches and other damage, restoring the film's original appearance. The restored version has been shown on television since October 2008 on the Encore Westerns channel.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He achieved considerable success in British cinema before becoming a star in Hollywood. He was nominated for three Academy Awards, three Golden Globes (winning once) and two BAFTA Awards throughout his career.\nMason began his career as a stage actor on the West End, before transitioning into leading man roles in films during the early 1940s. He was the top box-office attraction in the UK in 1944 and 1945; his British films included \"The Seventh Veil\" (1945) and \"The Wicked Lady\" (1945). He starred in \"Odd Man Out\" (1947), the first recipient of the BAFTA Award for Best British Film.\nMoving to the United States in the following decade, Mason starred in such films as George Cukor's \"A Star Is Born\" (1954) - earning a Golden Globe for Best Actor in a Motion Picture \u2013 Musical or Comedy, Alfred Hitchcock's \"North by Northwest\" (1959), Stanley Kubrick's \"Lolita\" (1962), Warren Beatty's \"Heaven Can Wait\" (1978) and Sidney Lumet's \"The Verdict\" (1982).\nHe also starred in a number of successful British and American films from the 1950s to the early 1980s, including: \"\" (1951), \"Julius Caesar\" (1953), \"20,000 Leagues Under the Sea\" (1954), \"Bigger Than Life\" (1956), \"Journey to the Center of the Earth\" (1959), \"Georgy Girl\" (1966), \"Spring and Port Wine\" (1970), and \"The Boys from Brazil\" (1978). Following his death in 1984, his ashes were interred near the tomb of his close friend, fellow English actor Sir Charlie Chaplin.\nEarly life, family and education.\nMason was born on 15 May 1909 in Huddersfield, in the West Riding of Yorkshire, the youngest of three sons of John Mason and Mabel Hattersley, daughter of Joseph Shaw Gaunt. A wealthy wool merchant like his father, John Mason travelled often on business, mainly in France and Belgium. Mabel\u2014who was \"uncommonly well-educated\" and had lived in London to study and begin work as an artist before returning to Yorkshire to care for her father\u2014was \"attentive and loving\" in raising her sons. \nThe Masons lived in a house in its own grounds on Croft House Lane in Marsh. It was replaced in the mid-1970s by flats called Arncliffe Court. A small residential development opposite where the house once stood is now called James Mason Court.\nMason was educated at Marlborough College and took a first in architecture at Peterhouse, Cambridge, where he became involved in stock theatre companies in his spare time. He had no formal acting training, and initially embarked upon it for fun.\nCareer.\n1931\u20131939: Early roles.\nAfter Cambridge, Mason made his stage debut in Aldershot in \"The Rascal\" in 1931. He joined the Old Vic theatre in London under the guidance of Tyrone Guthrie. While there he appeared in productions of \"The Cherry Orchard\", \"Henry VIII\", \"Measure for Measure\", \"The Importance of Being Earnest\", \"Love for Love\", \"The Tempest\", \"Twelfth Night\", and \"Macbeth\". Featuring in many of these were Charles Laughton and Elsa Lanchester. In the mid-1930s he also appeared at the Gate Theatre, Dublin, notably in \"Pride and Prejudice\" with Betty Chancellor. In 1933, Alexander Korda gave Mason a small role in \"The Private Life of Don Juan\" but sacked him three days into shooting.\nFrom 1935 to 1938, Mason starred in many British quota quickies, starting with his first film \"Late Extra\" (1935), in which he played the lead. Albert Parker directed. Mason appeared in \"Twice Branded\" (1936); \"Troubled Waters\" (1936), also directed by Parker; \"Prison Breaker\" (1936); \"Blind Man's Bluff\" (1936), for Parker's \"The Secret of Stamboul\" (1936), and \"The Mill on the Floss\" (1936), an \"A\" movie. Mason had a key support role in Korda's \"Fire Over England\" (1937) with Laurence Olivier and Vivien Leigh. He was in another \"A\", \"The High Command\" (1937) directed by Thorold Dickinson, then went back to quickies, starring in \"Catch As Catch Can\" (1937), directed by Roy Kellino. Korda cast him as the villain in \"The Return of the Scarlet Pimpernel\" (1937)\nMason began appearing in some televised productions of plays, made in the very early days of television: \"Cyrano de Bergerac\" (1938), \"The Moon in the Yellow River\" (1938), \"Bees on the Boat-Deck\" (1939), \"Square Pegs\" (1939), \"L'Avare\" (1939), and \"The Circle\" (1939). He returned to features with \"I Met a Murderer\" (1939) based on a story by Mason and Pamela Kellino, who also starred with Mason and whom he would marry. Her husband Roy Kellino directed.\n1941\u20131957: Leading man status.\nSecond World War\nMason registered as a conscientious objector during World War II (causing his family to break with him for many years), but his tribunal did not exempt him on the requirement for non-combatant military service, which he also refused. He appealed against that aspect of the tribunal's decision, but it became irrelevant once he was included in a general exemption for film work. In 1941\u201342 he returned to the stage to appear in \"Jupiter Laughs\" by A. J. Cronin. He established himself as a leading man in Britain in a series of films: \"The Patient Vanishes\" (1941); \"Hatter's Castle\" (1941) with Robert Newton and Deborah Kerr; \"The Night Has Eyes\" (1941); \"Alibi\" (1942) with Margaret Lockwood; \"Secret Mission\" (1942); \"Thunder Rock\" (1942) with Michael Redgrave; and \"The Bells Go Down\" (1943) with Tommy Trinder.\nMason became hugely popular for his brooding anti-heroes, and occasional outright villains, in the Gainsborough series of melodramas of the 1940s, starting with \"The Man in Grey\" (1943). The film was a huge hit and made him and co-stars Lockwood, Stewart Granger and Phyllis Calvert top-level stars. Mason starred in two wartime dramas, \"They Met in the Dark\" (1943) and \"Candlelight in Algeria\" (1944), then returned to Gainsborough melodrama with \"Fanny By Gaslight\" (1944) with Granger and Calvert; it was another big hit. He starred in \"Hotel Reserve\" (1944), a thriller, then did a ghost story for Gainsborough with Lockwood, \"A Place of One's Own\" (1945). Far more popular was a melodrama, \"They Were Sisters\" (1945).\nSydney Box cast Mason in a psychodrama about musicians, \"The Seventh Veil\" (1945), as the tyrannical guardian of pianist Ann Todd. It was a huge success in Britain and the US and demand for Mason was at a fever pitch. Exhibitors voted him the most popular star in Britain in each year between 1944 and 1947. They also declared him the most popular international star in 1946; he dropped to second place the following year. He was the most popular male star in Canada in 1948.\nMason had a relatively minor role in \"The Wicked Lady\" (1945) with Lockwood, a big hit. He then received his best reviews to date playing a mortally wounded IRA bank robber on the run in Carol Reed's \"Odd Man Out\" (1947). He turned producer with Sydney Box on \"The Upturned Glass\" (1947), which starred Mason with a script by Mason's wife. It was not particularly successful. Neither was \"Bathsheba,\" a play the Masons did on Broadway. Mason went to Hollywood for his first film, \"Caught\" (1949), directed by Max Oph\u00fcls, then played Gustave Flaubert in MGM's \"Madame Bovary\" (1949). He did another with Oph\u00fcls, \"The Reckless Moment\" (1949), and followed it with \"East Side, West Side\" (1949) with Barbara Stanwyck at MGM and \"One Way Street\" (1950) at Universal. He made \"Pandora and the Flying Dutchman\" (1951) with Ava Gardner. None of these films were particularly successful.\nFilms at 20th Century Fox\nMason's Hollywood career was revived when he was cast as General Rommel in \"\" (1951), directed by Henry Hathaway. To do the film he agreed to sign a contract with 20th Century Fox for seven years at one film a year. Mason did a film at Republic Pictures written by his wife and directed by Roy Kellino, \"Lady Possessed\" (1951). At Fox, he played a spy in \"5 Fingers\" (1951), directed by Joseph L. Mankiewicz. MGM hired him to play Rupert of Hentzau in \"The Prisoner of Zenda\" (1952) opposite Granger. He was in the lower budgeted \"Face to Face\" (1952) then went to Paramount to play a villainous sea captain opposite Alan Ladd in \"Botany Bay\" (1953).\nMason was one of many stars in MGM's \"The Story of Three Loves\" (1953). At Fox, he reprised his role as Rommel in \"The Desert Rats\" (1953), then he was reunited with Mankiewicz at MGM, playing Brutus in \"Julius Caesar\" (1953), opposite Marlon Brando. The film was very successful. Mason worked with Carol Reed in \"The Man Between\" (1953), then Fox used him as a villain again in \"Prince Valiant\" (1954). Mason did another film with a screenplay by his wife and directed by Roy Kellino, \"Charade\" (1954).\nWarner Bros., hired him to play Judy Garland's leading man in the George Cukor directed musical drama film \"A Star Is Born\" (1954). He took the role after Cary Grant turned the role down. Mason won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor \u2013 Motion Picture Musical or Comedy and was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor. Jack Moffitt of \"The Hollywood Reporter\" praised the film writing, \"\"A Star Is Born\" is the perfect blend of drama and musical \u2014 of cinematic art and popular entertainment.\"\nHe went over to Disney to play Captain Nemo in \"20,000 Leagues Under the Sea\" (1954), a huge hit which also starred Kirk Douglas. During 1954 and 1955, Mason was the host of some episodes of \"Lux Video Theatre\" on CBS television. Mason appeared with Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz in \"Forever, Darling\" (1956) then starred in and produced a film at Fox, \"Bigger Than Life\" (1956), directed by Nicholas Ray. Mason played a small-town school teacher driven insane by the effects of cortisone. He did another for Fox, the hugely popular melodrama, \"Island in the Sun\" (1957).\n1958\u20131970: Established actor.\nMason began appearing regularly on television in shows such as \"Panic!\", \"General Electric Theater\", \"Schlitz Playhouse\", \"Goodyear Theatre\" and \"Playhouse 90\" (several episodes including \"John Brown's Raid\"). He starred in two thrillers for Andrew L. Stone, \"Cry Terror!\" (1958) and \"The Decks Ran Red\" (1958) then played a suave master spy hunting down Cary Grant with romantic assistance from Eva Marie Saint in \"North by Northwest\" (1959), directed by Alfred Hitchcock.\nAt Fox he had a huge hit returning to Jules Verne science fantasy as the determined Scottish scientist and explorer in \"Journey to the Centre of the Earth\" (1959), taking over a role meant for Clifton Webb. He did a comedy \"A Touch of Larceny\" (1960) and was Sir Edward Carson in \"The Trials of Oscar Wilde\" (1960). He continued to appear on TV shows like \"The DuPont Show with June Allyson\", \"Golden Showcase\", \"Theatre '62\" and \"The Alfred Hitchcock Hour\".\nHe did \"The Marriage-Go-Round\" (1961), then played Dolores' sexually obsessive stepfather Humbert Humbert in Stanley Kubrick's version of \"Lolita\" (1962). He starred in \"Tiara Tahiti\" (1962), then \"Hero's Island\" (1962), which he also produced. He was in \"Torpedo Bay\" (1963).\nIn 1963 Mason settled in Switzerland, and embarked on a transatlantic career. He began to drift into support roles, or second leads: the epic \"The Fall of the Roman Empire\" (1964); \"The Pumpkin Eater\" (1964), with Anne Bancroft; a river pirate who betrays Peter O'Toole's character in \"Lord Jim\" (1965); a Chinese noble in \"Genghis Khan\" (1965); \"The Uninhibited\" (1965); a guest role on \"Dr Kildare\"; James Leamington in the Swinging London-set \"Georgy Girl\" (1966), a role that earned him a second Academy Award nomination, this one for Best Actor in a Supporting Role.\nIn 1967, Mason narrated the documentary \"The London Nobody Knows\". An ardent cinephile on top of his career interests, Mason narrated two British documentary series supervised by Kevin Brownlow: \"Hollywood\" (1980), on the silent cinema and \"Unknown Chaplin\" (1983), devoted to out-take material from the films of Sir Charlie Chaplin. Mason had been a long-time neighbour and friend of the actor and director Charlie Chaplin. In the late 1970s, Mason became a mentor to up-and-coming actor Sam Neill.\nHe was in several episodes of \"ITV Play of the Week\" and he had the lead in \"The Deadly Affair\" (1967) for Sidney Lumet (playing a character based on George Smiley though it was renamed); and \"Stranger in the House\" (1968). He provided a supporting role in \"Duffy\" (1968), \"The Blue Max (1966)\" and \"Mayerling\" (1968) but was top billed in \"The Sea Gull\" (1968) for Sidney Lumet and starred as Bradley Morahan in \"Age of Consent\" (1969) for Michael Powell, a film which Mason also produced. The movie featured Helen Mirren's first major film role, and was Powell's last major film. It was also through this film that Mason met his second wife, Clarissa Kaye. Mason also had the star role in \"Spring and Port Wine\" (1970).\n1970\u20131985: Later roles.\nMason supported Charles Bronson in \"Cold Sweat\" (1970) and Lee Van Cleef in \"Bad Man's River\" (1971). He was a support in \"Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill!\" (1971) and top billed in \"Child's Play\" (1972) for Lumet, replacing Marlon Brando. He was one of many stars in \"The Last of Sheila\" (1973) and played the evil Doctor Polidori in \"\" (1973). He had support roles in \"The MacKintosh Man\" (1973), \"11 Harrowhouse\" (1974), \"The Marseille Contract\" (1974), and \"Great Expectations\" (1974) and was top billed in \"Mandingo\" (1975).\nMason's later 70s performances included \"Kidnap Syndicate\" (1975), \"The Left Hand of the Law\" (1975), \"Autobiography of a Princess\" (1975), \"Inside Out\" (1975), \"The Flower in His Mouth\" (1975), \"Voyage of the Damned\" (1976), \"Hot Stuff\" (1977), \"Cross of Iron\" (1977), \"Jesus of Nazareth\" (1977), \"The Yin and the Yang of Mr. Go\" (1978), \"The Water Babies\" (1978), \"Heaven Can Wait\" (1978), \"The Boys from Brazil\" (1978), \"Murder by Decree\" (1979) (as Dr. Watson), \"The Passage\" (1979), \"Bloodline\" (1979) and as the vampire's servant, Richard Straker, in \"Salem's Lot\" (1979).\nMason was in \"North Sea Hijack\" (1980), supporting Roger Moore, \"Evil Under the Sun\" (1982), \"Ivanhoe\" (1982), and \"A Dangerous Summer\" (1982). One of his last roles, that of the corrupt lawyer Ed Concannon in \"The Verdict\" (1982), opposite Paul Newman, earned him his third and final Oscar nomination, for Best Actor in a Supporting Role. He had parts in \"Yellowbeard\" (1983), \"Alexandre\" (1983), and \"George Washington\" (1984).\nHaving completed playing the lead role in \"Dr. Fischer of Geneva\" (1985), adapted from Graham Greene's eponymous novella for the BBC, he stepped into the role in \"The Shooting Party\" originally meant for Paul Scofield, who was unable to continue after being seriously injured in an accident on the first day of shooting. This was to be Mason's final screen performance in a feature film. He did appear on television in \"A.D.\" (1985) and \"The Assisi Underground\" (1985).\nRecordings.\nJames Mason recorded an album for York Records. The 13-track spoken word album, \"James Mason Reads from the Bible\" was issued on York BYK 703 in 1971.\nPersonal life.\nMason was a devoted lover of animals, particularly cats. He and his wife, Pamela Mason, co-authored the book \"The Cats in Our Lives\", which was published in 1949. James wrote most of the book and also illustrated it. In \"The Cats in Our Lives\", he recounted humorous and sometimes touching tales of the cats (as well as a few dogs) he had known and loved.\nIn 1952, Mason purchased a house previously owned by Buster Keaton. There he discovered reels of nitrate film of some of Keaton's work that was considered lost, including \"The Boat\" (1921). He arranged to have the decomposing films transferred to safety stock, saving them from oblivion.\nIn his youth, Mason was a keen fan of his local Rugby League team, Huddersfield. In later years, he also followed the fortunes of Huddersfield Town.\nMason was married twice:\nMason's autobiography, \"Before I Forget\", was published in 1981.\nDeath.\nMason survived a severe heart attack in 1959. He died as result of another heart attack on 27 July 1984 in Lausanne, Switzerland, and was cremated. Mason left his entire estate to his second wife, Clarissa Kaye, but his will was challenged by his two children. The lawsuit had not been settled when she died on 21 July 1994 from cancer. \nClarissa Kaye Mason left her holdings to the religious guru Sathya Sai Baba, including the actor's ashes, which she had retained in their shared home. Mason's children sued Sai Baba and had Mason's ashes interred in Corsier-sur-Vevey, Vaud, Switzerland. The remains of Mason's friend Charlie Chaplin are in a tomb a few steps away. Mason's children specified that his headstone read: \"Never say in grief you are sorry he's gone. Rather, say in thankfulness you are grateful he was here\", words that were spoken to Portland Mason by U.S. Senator Ted Kennedy after the actor's death.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "74389", "revid": "1310642007", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=74389", "title": "The Hustler (novel)", "text": "American novel about gambling\nThe Hustler is a 1959 debut novel by American writer Walter Tevis. It tells the story of a young pool hustler, Edward \"Fast Eddie\" Felson, who challenges the legendary Minnesota Fats. The novel was well-received by critics, and was adapted into a 1961 film of the same title, starring Paul Newman as Fast Eddie, Jackie Gleason as Minnesota Fats, and Piper Laurie as Sarah. A sequel, \"The Color of Money\", was published in 1984.\nSynopsis.\nEddie \"Fast Eddie\" Felson is a young pool hustler from Oakland, California, who travels the country with his middle-aged partner Charlie Fenniger, pretending to be a worse pool player than he actually is to win bets. He goes with Charlie to Chicago, where he plays the legendary pool player George Hegerman, known as Minnesota Fats, at Bennington\u2019s pool hall. After beating Fats in a number of games, at one time being ahead of him by $18,000, he gets drunk and proceeds to lose to Fats, collapsing exhausted after 40 hours of playing. Eddie leaves Charlie without saying goodbye and returns to hustling.\nEddie meets a college student, Sarah, at a bus station. They commence an affair and begin to live together. Returning to Bennington\u2019s he encounters Bert, a professional gambler, who tells Eddie that despite his talent he lost to Fats due to lack of character, as well as an ingrained eagerness to lose. Nevertheless he offers to back him in a game with a rich pool player in Kentucky named Findlay, taking 75 percent of any winnings while absorbing all losses and paying expenses. Eddie turns him down and resumes hustling. Disregarding Bert's advice, he hustles pool at a pool hall patronized by tough migrants from Appalachia. They break his thumbs.\nAfter recuperating at Sarah's apartment, he accepts Bert's offer. Leaving Sarah behind in Chicago, they travel to Kentucky and Eddie plays Findlay at his home in Lexington. It turns out that Findlay plays billiards, not pool, which puts Eddie at a disadvantage. During the game he realizes that Findlay is a billiard hustler. Though chagrined that he is being \"hustled,\" Eddie has an epiphany. Watching Findlay falter, he realizes the validity of what Bert had been telling him about winning being everything, how people crave an excuse to lose, and how character is as important as skill. Despite continual pain in his thumbs, he wins against Findlay. He and Bert drive back to Chicago, where Eddie reunites with Sarah but does not move back in with her. He returns to Bennington\u2019s where he sees Charlie, who says that he had been worried about him and flew out from Oakland to find him. He confesses that he had held out $5,000 in winnings and pays it to him. Eddie proceeds to play Minnesota Fats with his own money, and beats him.\nBert demands thirty percent of his winnings and says that he is his manager. Charlie backs him up. Eddie rejects paying Bert any money and shrugs off Bert's threat to have his thumbs and an arm broken, and ridicules Bert's intimation that he has criminal connections. As the novel ends, Eddie and Bert are at a stalemate.\nCritical reception.\n\"New York Times\" critic Rex Lardner called the book \"a tense, jolting trip to the tough, dusty, smoky, ball-clackety, money-filled world of the pool shark,\" and wrote that Tevis \"writes like a streak, making straight pool as exciting as a Stanley Ketchell fight. This is a fine, swift, wanton, offbeat novel.\"\nAn unsigned review in \"Time\" said that \"The Hustler\" \"has its faults as a novel, but opens the door on a world that books have not yet made commonplace\". It went on to say that: \"The moral of \"The Hustler\" is obviously sententious, the love story is a cliche, and author Tevis' writing is sometimes too painfully exact. What remains is a succession of scenes in which a smoky, seedy world becomes sharply alive, and where crises are intense even though the scene is grubby and the game is only pool.\"\n\"Kirkus Reviews\" called it a \"compact, tidy novel\", and said: \"Through a language of casual statement which does not disguise the seriousness of its intent, this exploration of moral experience is a pithy and competent performance.\"\nBackground.\nTevis grew up in Kentucky, and became good friends with a youth whose father bought him a pool table to keep him out of trouble. He was introduced to gambling when he was in the Navy, and a writer for \"Kentucky Monthly\" observed in 2019 that \"The combination of pool and gambling started the clock ticking toward what was to come.\" He called himself as a \"B-minus\" pool player who could not play professionals with any hope of winning.\nThe pool rooms described in the book were fictionalized by Tevis, and he insisted that despite claims by Rudolf Wanderone to be the model of the character, Minnesota Fats was entirely fictional. He told an interviewer in 1981: \"A lot of people ask me, 'When did you first meet Minnesota Fats?' And I feel like Walt Disney being asked, 'When did you meet Donald Duck?' Come on, I made him up. One of my contributions to American folklore.\" Tevis has described Fast Eddie's hometown of Oakland as a \"disguised autobiographical reference\" to San Francisco, where Tevis was born.\nA pool player named Eddie Parker asserted that he was the basis for the Fast Eddie character. But Tevis maintained that Fast Eddie was fictitious, and he resented assertions to the contrary, that he had \"created such memorable characters out of mere reportage\". After his death in 1984, his widow debunked claims for years that the Fast Eddie character was based on a real person.\nIn 2019, a researcher examined the novel's original manuscript and found that Tevis had changed the character name from \"New York Fats\" to \"Minnesota Fats,\" lending credence to the claim of Rudolf Wanderone, who called himself \"New York Fats,\" that he was the inspiration for the character.\nPrinting history.\nAvailable editions include:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Radioactive decay often proceeds via a sequence of steps (decay chain). For example, 238U decays to 234Th which decays to 234mPa which decays, and so on, to 206Pb (which is stable):\nformula_1\nIn this example:\nThese might also be referred to as the daughter products of 238U.\nDecay products are important in understanding radioactive decay and the management of radioactive waste.\nFor elements above lead in atomic number, the decay chain typically ends with an isotope of lead or bismuth. Bismuth itself decays to thallium, but the decay is so slow as to be practically negligible.\nIn many cases, individual members of the decay chain are as radioactive as the parent, but far smaller in volume/mass. Thus, although uranium is not dangerously radioactive when pure, some pieces of naturally occurring pitchblende are quite dangerous owing to their radium-226 content, which is soluble and not a ceramic like the parent. Similarly, thorium gas mantles are very slightly radioactive when new, but become more radioactive after only a few months of storage as the daughters of 232Th build up.\nAlthough it cannot be predicted whether any given atom of a radioactive substance will decay at any given time, the decay products of a radioactive substance are extremely predictable. Because of this, decay products are important to scientists in many fields who need to know the quantity or type of the parent product. Such studies are done to measure pollution levels (in and around nuclear facilities) and for other matters.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The film stars Chaplin's Tramp character as an immigrant coming to the United States who is accused of theft on the voyage across the Atlantic Ocean and falls in love with a beautiful young woman along the way. It also stars Edna Purviance and Eric Campbell.\nAccording to Kevin Brownlow and David Gill's documentary series \"Unknown Chaplin\", the first scenes to be written and filmed take place in what became the movie's second half, in which the penniless Tramp finds a coin and goes for a meal in a restaurant, not realizing that the coin has fallen out of his pocket. It was not until later that Chaplin's Tramp was penniless because he had just arrived on a boat from Europe and used this notion as the basis for the first half. Purviance reportedly was required to eat so many plates of beans during the many takes to complete the restaurant sequence (in character as another immigrant who falls in love with Charlie) that she became physically ill.\nThe scene in which Chaplin's character kicks an immigration officer was cited later as evidence of his anti-Americanism when he was forced to leave the United States in 1952. In 1998, \"The Immigrant\" was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.\"\nPlot.\nThe film begins aboard a steamship crossing the Atlantic Ocean and initially showcases the misadventures of an unnamed immigrant, the Little Tramp (Chaplin), who finds himself in assorted mischief. The scene opens with Charlie bent double over the side of the ship, appearing to be seasick. Then it is revealed he is only fishing.\nMuch humor is derived from the heavy sway of the boat, with much sliding around the deck.\nCharlie, among other things, plays cards, eats in the mess hall and avoids seasick passengers. Along the way, he befriends another unnamed immigrant (Purviance) who is traveling to America with her ailing mother. The two have been robbed by a pickpocket who loses the money to the Tramp in a card game. The Tramp, feeling sorry for the two penniless women, attempts to secretly place his winnings from his card game in the woman's pocket but ends up being mistakenly accused of being a pickpocket. The woman manages to clear the Tramp's name. Upon arrival in America, the passengers stare at the Statue of Liberty but, once landed, the Tramp and the woman part company.\nLater, hungry and broke, the Tramp finds a coin on the street outside a restaurant and pockets it. He doesn't realize there is a hole in his pocket, and the coin has fallen straight through and is back on the ground. He enters the restaurant, where he orders a plate of beans, at first eating one bean at a time. There, he is reunited with the woman and discovers her mother is dead. The Tramp orders a second bowl of beans for her.\nAs they eat, they watch the restaurant's burly head waiter (Campbell) and other waiters attack and forcibly eject a patron who is short 10 cents &amp;lpar;&amp;dollar;\u00a0in &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Tooltip/styles.css\" /&gt;) in paying his bill. The Tramp, intimidated by the waiter, checks and now realizes he has lost his coin. Terrified of facing the same treatment as the man he saw thrown out, the Tramp begins planning how he will fight the huge man. However, a stranger enters, flaunting the coin he found outside. When the headwaiter takes the coin, it also falls from his pocket onto the floor. The Tramp then makes many failed attempts to retrieve it without notice. He finally retrieves the coin and nonchalantly pays the waiter, only to be thunderstruck when the waiter reveals the coin to be fake. Once again, the Tramp prepares to fight. Just then, a visiting artist spots the Tramp and the woman and offers them a job to pose for a painting. The two agree. The artist offers to pay for the Tramp and the woman's meal, but the Tramp declines the offer several times for reasons of etiquette, intending to accept the artist's offer eventually; however, he's dismayed when the artist does not renew his offer to pay at the last moment. The artist pays for his own meal and leaves a tip for the waiter. The Tramp notices that the tip is enough to cover the couple's meal and, without the artist noticing, palms the tip and presents it to the waiter as his payment for his and the woman's meal. As a final riposte, he lets the waiter keep the remaining change \u2014 one small coin \u2014 after paying his bill. The waiter thinks the artist himself has given no tip whatsoever and is upset at this supposed action.\nAfterward, outside a marriage license office in the rain, the Tramp proposes marriage to the woman, who is coy and reluctant until the Tramp physically carries her into the office while she waves her arms and kicks her feet in protest.\nProduction.\nEpisode 1 of the 1983 documentary series \"Unknown Chaplin\" reveals that Chaplin developed the storyline for \"The Immigrant\" as filming progressed. Initially, the movie began as a comedy set in an artists' cafe, with Purviance as a brightly dressed patron.\nThis plot was abandoned almost immediately, before Chaplin's character was introduced, the documentary states, and Chaplin began again, with a story, still set in a cafe, about a man who has never been in a restaurant before displaying terrible table manners before meeting a lovely girl (Purviance) and shaping up. Initially, Henry Bergman played the bully-ish head waiter, but Chaplin eventually replaced him with Eric Campbell.\nAccording to \"Unknown Chaplin\", Chaplin developed the idea of the tramp and Purviance's character being immigrants when he realized he needed more plot to justify the restaurant scenes. After filming the film's opening sequences of the arrival in America, he reshot parts of the restaurant scene to be consistent with the new plot (bringing Bergman back in a new role as an artist who resolves the subplot of Charlie being unable to pay for dinner), and added the epilogue in which the Tramp and Purviance are married.\nSound version.\nIn 1932, Amedee Van Beuren of Van Beuren Studios, purchased Chaplin's Mutual comedies for $10,000 each, added music by Gene Rodemich and Winston Sharples and sound effects, and re-released them through RKO Radio Pictures. Chaplin had no legal recourse to stop the RKO release.\nReception.\nLike many American films of the time, \"The Immigrant\" was subjected to some cuts by city and state film censorship boards. The Chicago Board of Censors required two cuts to the film, the first being the closeup showing the stealing of a moneybag, and the second involving nose thumbing as an insult.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Curtis\nIn the Land of the Head Hunters (also called In the Land of the War Canoes) is a 1914 silent film fictionalizing the world of the Kwakwaka'wakw peoples of the Queen Charlotte Strait region of the Central Coast of British Columbia, Canada, written and directed by Edward S. Curtis and acted entirely by Kwakwaka'wakw native people.\nThe film was selected in 1999 for preservation in the U.S. National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically, and aesthetically significant.\" It was the first feature-length film whose cast was composed entirely of Native North Americans; the second, eight years later, was Robert Flaherty's \"Nanook of the North\". Most of the film was shot on the Deer Island near Fort Rupert, British Columbia. It was the first feature film made in British Columbia, and is the oldest surviving feature film made in Canada.\nOriginal release.\nCurtis had earlier experimented with multimedia. In 1911 he created a stage show with slides, a lecture, and live musical accompaniment, called \"The Indian Picture Opera\". He used stereopticon projectors, where two projectors dissolved back and forth between images. This was his prelude to entering the motion picture era.\nThe film opened in New York City and Seattle, Washington in December 1914, with live performances of a score by John J. Braham. Braham had access to wax cylinder recordings of Kwakwaka'wakw music, and the promotional campaign at the time suggested that his score was based on these; in fact, there were few snatches of Kwakwaka'wakw music in the score. Curtis hoped the film would be successful enough to fund the completion of \"The North American Indian\", a multi-volume history of every indigenous tribe on the continent he had been working on since 1906. Although critically praised, the film was a commercial failure. Curtis spent approximately $75,000 to make the film, but it only earned $3,269.18 after a year in theaters. He was so disappointed with the film's financial performance that he sold all the rights to the film to the New York Museum of Natural History in 1919 or 1920. When the museum lost Curtis's donated material, the film was considered lost until 1947.\nSalvaging the film and score.\nA single damaged, incomplete print of the film was salvaged from a dumpster by film collector Hugo Zeiter of Danville Illinois and donated to Chicago's Field Museum of Natural History in 1947. Bill Holm and George Quimby obtained a 16mm copy in 1965 and completed a re-edited version of the film in 1974, having added a soundtrack by Kwakwaka'wakw musicians, and released the result as \"In the Land of the War Canoes\". Independently, some other damaged clips from the film made their way to the UCLA Film and Television Archive. The score had been filed at the library of the Getty Research Institute, but without a title that tied it to the film. The 2008 restoration brought together these materials. Milestone Films has announced plans to release a restored \"One-Hundredth Anniversary\" DVD of the film with the original score in 2014.\nHistorical accuracy.\n\"In the Land of the Head Hunters\" has often been discussed as a flawed documentary film. The film combines many accurate representations of aspects of Kwakwaka'wakw culture, art, and technology from the era in which it was made with a melodramatic plot based on practices that either dated from long before the first contact of the Kwakwaka'wakw with people of European descent or were entirely fictional. Curtis appears never to have specifically presented the film as a documentary, but he also never specifically called it a work of fiction.\nSome aspects of the film do have documentary accuracy: the artwork, the ceremonial dances, the clothing, the architecture of the buildings, and the construction of the dugout, or a war canoe reflected Kwakwaka'wakw culture. Other aspects of the film were based on the Kwakwaka'wakw's orally transmitted traditions or on aspects of other neighboring cultures. The film also accurately portrays Kwakwaka'wakw rituals that were, at the time, prohibited by Canada's potlatch prohibition, enacted in 1884 and not rescinded until 1951.\nHowever, as is noted by the producers who supervised the centennial restoration of the film,\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The most sensational elements of the film\u2014the head hunting, sorcery, and handling of human remains\u2014reflect much earlier practices that had been long abandoned, but which became central elements in Curtis's spectacularized tale. And some activities were never part of Kwakwaka\u2019wakw culture. For example, Curtis borrowed the whaling practices (and the rented whale!) from neighboring groups for what seem to be purely dramatic and cinematic reasons.\nPlot.\nThe following plot synopsis was published in conjunction with a 1915 showing of the film at Carnegie Hall:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;To gain power from the spirit forces, Motana, a great chief's son, goes on a vigil-journey. But though the tribal law forbids the thought of woman during the fasting, his dreams are ever of Naida; her face appearing in the coiling smoke of the prayer-fire he builds high upon a mountain peak. To forfend the anger of the spirits he must pass a stronger ordeal. He sleeps upon the Island of the Dead, then hunts and kills the whale; and raids the clustered sea-lion rookeries, a whole day's paddle out to sea.\nNaida is wooed and won by Motana, and splendid is the wooing. But Naida, with her dowry, is coveted by the Sorcerer. He is evil, old and ugly. Waket, Naida's father fears the baleful \"medicine\" of the Sorcerer, and also stands in dread of the Sorcerer's brother, who is Yaklus, \"the short life bringer,\" and the head-hunting scourge of all the coast. Waket promises Naida to the Sorcerer. So ensues war between the two factions.\nMotana and his father, Kenada, and their clan resolve to rid the region of the head hunters. In their great canoes they attack the village of the Sorcerer and Yaklus. The Sorcerer's head they bring to prove his death to those who believed him \"deathless.\" But Yaklus escapes. After the wedding of Motana and Naida, with pomp of primitive pageantry, and dancing and feasting, in which the throngs of two great totem villages take part, Yaklus attacks and burns Motana's village. Motana is left for dead. Naida is carried away into captivity. Wild is the reveling that follows at the village of Yaklus. The beauty of Naida's dancing saves her life. Naida's slave boy, a fellow captive, escapes. His message brings Motana, who rescues Naida by stealth. The raging Yaklus pursues. Motana, hard pressed, dares the waters of the surging gorge of Hyal. His canoe flies through, but Yaklus is overwhelmed and drowned.\nCast.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;* Maggie Frank\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Saumur station has rail connections to Tours, Angers, La Roche-sur-Yon and Nantes.\nToponymy.\nFirst attested in the Medieval Latin form of \"Salmuri\" in 968 AD, the origin of the name is obscure. Albert Dauzat hypothesized a pre-Celtic unattested element \"*sala\" 'marshy ground' (\"cf.\" Celtic \"salm\" 'which jumps and flows'), followed by another unattested element meaning \"wall\". Many places in Europe seem to contain \"*Sal(m)-\" elements, which may share Old European roots.\nHistory.\nThe Dolmen de Bagneux on the south of the town, is 23 meters long and is built from 15 large slabs of the local stone, weighing over 500 tons. It is the largest in France.\nThe Ch\u00e2teau de Saumur was constructed in the 10th century to protect the Loire River crossing from Norman attacks after the settlement of Saumur was sacked in 845. The castle, destroyed in 1067 and inherited by the House of Plantagenet, was rebuilt by Henry II of England in the later 12th century. It changed hands several times between Anjou and France until 1589.\nHouses in Saumur are constructed almost exclusively of Tuffeau stone. The caves dug to excavate the stone are now often used as commercial wine cellars.\nAmyraldism, or the School of Saumur, is a distinctive form of Reformed theology taught by Moses Amyraut at the University of Saumur in the 17th century. Saumur is also the scene for Balzac's novel \"Eug\u00e9nie Grandet\", written in 1833.\nPrior to the French Revolution, Saumur was the capital of the S\u00e9n\u00e9chauss\u00e9e de Saumur, a bailiwick which existed until 1793. Saumur was the location of the Battle of Saumur during the Revolt in the Vend\u00e9e. It hosted a state prison under Napoleon. The town was an equestrian centre with both the military cavalry school from 1783 and later the Cadre Noir equestrian team.\nWorld War II.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Stack/styles.css\"/&gt; \nDuring the Battle of France in World War II, Saumur was the site of the Battle of Saumur (1940); the town and south bank of the Loire were defended by the teenage cadets of the cavalry school.\nIn 1944 it was the target of the first Tallboy and the fourth Azon bombing raids by Allied planes. On 8/9 June 1944, Tallboy \"earthquake\" bombs were first used, against a railway tunnel near Saumur. The hastily organized night raid was to stop a planned German Panzer Division, travelling to engage the newly landed allied forces in Normandy. The panzers were expected to use the railway to cross the Loire. No. 83 Squadron RAF illuminated the area with flares from four Avro Lancasters and marked the target at low level by three de Havilland Mosquitos. 25 Lancasters of No. 617 Squadron RAF, the \"Dambusters\" then dropped their Tallboys from with great accuracy. They hit the approaches to the bridge, blocked the railway cutting and one pierced the roof of the tunnel, bringing down a huge quantity of rock and soil which blocked the tunnel, badly delaying the German reinforcements moving towards Normandy, especially 2nd SS Panzer Division Das Reich. The damaged tunnel was quickly dug out to make a deeper cutting, resulting in the need for a second attack.\nOn 22 June, nine Consolidated B-24 Liberators of the United States Army Air Forces used the new Azon glide bombs against the Saumur rail bridge; escorted by 43 North American P-51 Mustangs. They failed to destroy the bridge. During the morning of 24 June, 38 American Boeing B-17 Flying Fortresses with conventional bombs attacked the bridge; escort was provided by 121 of 135 P-51s. The bridge was damaged.\nThe town of Saumur was awarded the Croix de Guerre with palm for its resistance and display of French patriotism during the war.\nMain attractions.\nSaumur is home to the Cadre Noir, the \u00c9cole Nationale d'\u00c9quitation (National Equestrian School), known for its annual horse shows, as well as the Armoured Branch and Cavalry Training School, the officer school for armored forces (tanks).\nThere is the national tank museum, the Mus\u00e9e des Blind\u00e9s, with more than 850 armored vehicles, wheeled or tracked. Most of them are from France, though some come from other countries such as Brazil, Germany, and the Soviet Union, as well as axis and allied vehicles of World War Two.\nThe annual military \"Carrousel\" takes place in July each year, as it has done for over 160 years, with displays of horse cavalry skills, historic and modern military vehicles.\nAmongst the most important monuments of Saumur are the great Ch\u00e2teau de Saumur itself which stands high above the town, and the nearby Ch\u00e2teau de Beaulieu which stands just 200 metres from the south bank of the Loire River and which was designed by the architect Jean Drapeau. A giant sequoia tree (which is protected) stands in the grounds of Ch\u00e2teau de Beaulieu. The Dolmen de Bagneux is on the old road going south.\nThe architectural character of the town owes much to the fact that it is constructed almost exclusively of Tuffeau stone.\nThe wine industry surrounds Saumur, many utilising the tunnels as cellars with the hundreds of domaines producing white, red, ros\u00e9 and sparkling wines. Visits to producers and the annual \"Grandes Tabl\u00e9es du Saumur-Champigny\" is an annual event held in early August with over 1\u00a0km of tables set up in Saumur so people can sample the local foods and wine.\nSaumur has a weekly market every Saturday morning with hundreds of stalls open for business in the streets and squares of the old town, from before 8am.\nNotable people.\nSaumur was the birthplace of:\nOther:\nTwin towns \u2013 sister cities.\nSaumur is twinned with:\nDemographics.\nIn 1973 Saumur absorbed four neighbouring communes.

The black-and-white film was exhibited in 2.00:1 Superscope and shot in the film noir style. Daniel Mainwaring adapted the screenplay from Jack Finney's 1954 science-fiction novel \"The Body Snatchers\". The film was an independent production but distributed by Allied Artists Pictures as a double feature with the British science-fiction film \"The Atomic Man\" (and in some markets with \"Indestructible Man\").\nThe film's storyline concerns an extraterrestrial invasion that begins in the fictional California town of Santa Mira. Alien plant spores have fallen from space and grown into large seed pods, each one capable of producing a visually identical copy of a human. As each pod reaches full development, it assimilates the physical traits, memories, and personalities of each sleeping person placed near it until only the replacement is left; these duplicates, however, are devoid of all human emotion. Little by little, a local doctor uncovers this \"quiet\" invasion and attempts to stop it.\nThe slang expression \"pod people\" that arose in late 20th-century U.S. culture refers to the emotionless duplicates seen in the film. \"Invasion of the Body Snatchers\" was selected in 1994 for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress for being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.\"\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nPlot.\nA psychiatrist, Dr. Hill, is called to a Los Angeles hospital, where a man named Dr. Miles Bennell is being held in custody. Miles recounts the events leading up to his arrest and arrival at the hospital.\nIn the nearby town of Santa Mira, Miles sees a number of patients suffering from the belief that their relatives have been replaced with identical-looking impostors. Psychiatrist Dr. Dan Kauffman assures Miles that these cases are merely a mass hysteria. Miles's ex-girlfriend Becky Driscoll has recently come back to town after settling a divorce, and they rekindle their relationship. The couple are called to the home of Miles's friend Jack Belicec, who has found a body in his basement. It has no features or fingerprints, but under their observation it takes on the features of Jack. Remembering that Becky's father was uncharacteristically emerging from his basement, Miles searches there and finds a duplicate of Becky. When Miles calls Dan to the scene, the bodies have disappeared, and Dan tells Miles that he is falling for the same hysteria.\nDistraught by the incidents, Jack and his wife Teddy spend the night at Miles's place. They find duplicates of themselves emerging from pods in Miles's greenhouse and conclude that the townspeople are being replaced while asleep with copies. Miles tries to make a call to authorities, but the operator claims that all lines are busy and he cannot be put through, so Jack and Teddy drive off to seek help in the next town. Miles and Becky realize that all of Santa Mira's inhabitants have been replaced. They hide at Miles's office for the night.\nThey observe truckloads of the pods arrive downtown. Chief Nick Grivett directs the others to take them to towns to be planted and used to replace their populations. Dan and Jack arrive at Miles's office with pods for Becky and Miles, and say they and Teddy are now members of an extraterrestrial race which arrived on Earth through seeds which sprouted the pods. After their takeover, humanity will lose all emotions and sense of individuality.\nUsing misdirection, Miles and Becky overcome and knock out their captors, and leave the office. To avoid recapture, they pretend Dan succeeded in replacing them with emotionless pod people. However, Becky screams at a near-traffic accident, exposing their humanity to the aliens. An alarm is sounded and the couple flees.\nThe couple hide in a mine outside town. After their pursuers move on they hear music, and Miles leaves Becky to investigate. He sees a farm with hundreds of pods being loaded onto trucks. Miles returns to find Becky succumbing to fatigue. Upon kissing her, he realizes that she has been replaced by a pod person. Becky sounds the alarm as Miles runs away. Desperate, he screams at the drivers on the highway for help.\nMiles finishes his story. A driver is wheeled into the hall on a gurney after having been injured in an accident. The attendant recounts that the man had to be dug out from under a load of mysterious pods coming from Santa Mira. With a key detail thus confirmed, Dr. Hill now believes Miles's story. He alerts the police to block the roads in and out of Santa Mira and calls the Federal Bureau of Investigation.\nProduction.\nNovel and screenplay.\nJack Finney's novel ends with the extraterrestrials, who have a lifespan of no more than five years, leaving Earth after they realize that humans are offering strong resistance, despite having little reasonable chance against the alien invasion.\nBudgeting and casting.\n\"Invasion of the Body Snatchers\" was originally scheduled for a 24-day shoot and a budget of US$454,864. The studio later asked Wanger to cut the budget significantly. The producer proposed a shooting schedule of 20 days and a budget of $350,000.\nInitially, Wanger considered Gig Young, Dick Powell, Joseph Cotten, and several others for the role of Miles. For Becky, he considered casting Anne Bancroft, Donna Reed, Kim Hunter, Vera Miles, and others. With the lower budget, however, he abandoned these choices and offered the part to Richard Kiley, who had just starred in \"The Phenix City Story\" for Allied Artists. Kiley turned the role down and Wanger cast Kevin McCarthy, an Academy Award nominee five years earlier for \"Death of a Salesman\", and relative newcomer Dana Wynter, who had done several major dramatic roles on television.\nFuture director Sam Peckinpah had a small part as Charlie, a meter reader. Peckinpah was a dialogue coach on five Siegel films in the mid-1950s, including this one.\nPrincipal photography.\nOriginally, producer Wanger and Siegel wanted to film \"Invasion of the Body Snatchers\" on location in Mill Valley, California, the town just north of San Francisco, that Jack Finney described in his novel. In the first week of January 1955, Siegel, Wanger, and screenwriter Daniel Mainwaring visited Finney to talk about the film version and to look at Mill Valley. The location proved too expensive, and Siegel with Allied Artist executives, found locations resembling Mill Valley in the Los Angeles area, including Sierra Madre, Chatsworth, Glendale, Los Feliz, Bronson, and Beachwood Canyons, all of which went on to make up the fictional town of \"Santa Mira\" for the film. In addition to these outdoor locations, much of the film was shot in the Allied Artists studio on the east side of Hollywood.\n\"Invasion of the Body Snatchers\" was shot by cinematographer Ellsworth Fredericks in 23 days between March 23 and April 27, 1955. The cast and crew worked a six-day week with Sundays off. The production went over schedule by three days because of the night-for-night shooting that Siegel wanted. Additional photography took place in September 1955, filming a frame story on which the studio had insisted (see Original ending). The final budget was $382,190.\nPost-production.\nThe project was originally named \"The Body Snatchers\" after the Finney serial, but Wanger wanted to avoid confusion with the 1945 Val Lewton film \"The Body Snatcher\". The producer was unable to come up with a title and accepted the studio's choice, \"They Come from Another World\" and that was assigned in summer 1955. Siegel objected to this title and suggested two alternatives, \"Better Off Dead\" and \"Sleep No More\", while Wanger offered \"Evil in the Night\" and \"World in Danger\". None of these was chosen, and the studio settled on \"Invasion of the Body Snatchers\" in late 1955. The film was released at the time in France under the mistranslated title (literally: \"Invasion of the defilers of tombs\"), which remains unchanged today.\nWanger wanted to add a variety of speeches and prefaces. He suggested a voice-over introduction for Miles. While the film was being shot, Wanger tried to get permission in England to use a Winston Churchill quotation as a preface to the film. The producer sought out Orson Welles to voice the preface and a trailer for the film. He wrote speeches for Welles' opening on June 15, 1955, and worked to persuade Welles to do it, but was unsuccessful. Wanger considered science-fiction author Ray Bradbury, instead, but this did not happen, either. Mainwaring eventually wrote the voice-over narration himself.\nThe studio scheduled three film previews on the last days of June and the first day of July 1955. According to Wanger's memoranda at the time, the previews were successful. Later reports by Mainwaring and Siegel, however, contradict this, claiming that audiences could not follow the film and laughed in the wrong places. In response, the studio removed much of the film's humor, \"humanity\", and \"quality\", according to Wanger. He scheduled another preview in mid-August that also did not go well. In later interviews, Siegel pointed out studio policy was to not mix humor with horror.\nWanger saw the final cut in December 1955 and protested the use of the Superscope aspect ratio. Its use had been included in early plans for the film, but the first print was not made until December. Wanger felt that the film lost sharpness and detail. Siegel originally shot \"Invasion of the Body Snatchers\" in the 1.85:1 aspect ratio. Superscope was a post-production laboratory process designed to create an anamorphic print from nonanamorphic source material that would be projected at an aspect ratio of 2.00:1.\nOriginal ending.\nBoth Siegel and Mainwaring were satisfied with the film as shot. The original ending did not include the flashback framing, and ended with Miles screaming as truckloads of pods pass him on the road. The studio, wary of a pessimistic conclusion, insisted on adding a prologue and epilogue suggesting a more optimistic outcome to the story, leading to the flashback framing. In this version, the film begins with Bennell in custody in a hospital emergency ward, telling a consulting psychiatrist (Whit Bissell) his story. In the closing scenes, pods are discovered at a highway accident, confirming Bennell's warning, and the authorities are alerted, likely stopping the pod distribution and resolving the extraterrestrial threat.\nMainwaring scripted this framing story and Siegel shot it on September 16, 1955, at the Allied Artists studio. In a later interview, Siegel complained, \"The film was nearly ruined by those in charge at Allied Artists who added a preface and ending that I don't like.\" In his autobiography Siegel added that \"Wanger was very much against this, as was I. However, he begged me to shoot it to protect the film, and I reluctantly consented [...].\"\nWhile the Internet Movie Database states that the film had been revised to its original ending for a re-release in 1979, Steve Biodrowski of \"Cinefantastique\" magazine notes that the film was still being shown with the complete footage, including a 2005 screening at the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences honoring director Don Siegel.\nAlthough most reviewers disliked it, George Turner (in \"American Cinematographer\") and Danny Peary (in \"Cult Movies\") endorsed the subsequently added frame story. Nonetheless, Peary emphasized that the added scenes changed significantly what he saw as the film's original intention.\nTheatrical release.\nWhen the film was released domestically in February 1956, many theaters displayed several pods made of \"papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9\" in theater lobbies and entrances, along with large lifelike black-and-white cutouts of McCarthy and Wynter running away from a crowd. The film earned more than $1\u00a0million in the first month, and in 1956 alone earned more than $2.5\u00a0million in the U.S. When the film was released in the UK (with cuts imposed by the British censors) in late 1956, the film earned the equivalent of more than half-a-million dollars in ticket sales.\nReception and legacy.\nCritical reception.\nThough \"Invasion of the Body Snatchers\" was largely ignored by critics on its initial run, Filmsite.org ranked it as one of the best films of 1956. The film holds a 98% approval rating and 9.1/10 rating at the film review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes. The site's consensus reads: \"One of the best political allegories of the 1950s, \"Invasion of the Body Snatchers\" is an efficient, chilling blend of sci-fi and horror.\" Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the a score of 92 out of 100, based on 16 critics, indicating .\nIn recent years, critics such as Dan Druker of the \"Chicago Reader\" have called the film a \"genuine Sci-Fi classic.\" Leonard Maltin described \"Invasion of the Body Snatchers\" as \"influential, and still very scary.\" \"Time Out\" called the film one of the \"most resonant\" and \"one of the simplest\" of the genre. Mark Steyn described it as \"a big film\", despite its limited budget.\n\"Invasion of the Body Snatchers\" was selected in 1994 for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\". In June 2008, the American Film Institute revealed its \"Ten top Ten\"\u2014the best 10 films in 10 \"classic\" American film genres\u2014after polling more than 1,500 people from the creative community. \"Invasion of the Body Snatchers\" was acknowledged as the 9th-best film in the science-fiction genre. The film was also placed on AFI's \"AFI's 100 Years ... 100 Thrills\", a list of America's most heart-pounding films.\nThe film was included on Bravo's \"100 Scariest Movie Moments\". Similarly, the Chicago Film Critics Association named it the 29th scariest film ever made. IGN ranked it as the 15th-best sci-fi picture. \"Time\" magazine included \"Invasion of the Body Snatchers\" on their list of 100 all-time best films, the top 10 1950s Sci-Fi Movies, and Top 25 Horror Films. In 1999, \"Entertainment Weekly\" listed it as the 53rd best movie of all time. Similarly, the book \"Four Star Movies: The 101 Greatest Films of All Time\" placed the movie at #60.\nThemes.\nSome reviewers saw in the story a commentary on the dangers facing the United States for turning a blind eye to McCarthyism. Leonard Maltin wrote of a McCarthy-era subtext, or of bland conformity in postwar Eisenhower-era America. Others viewed it as an allegory for the loss of personal autonomy and individualism in the Soviet Union or communist systems in general.\nFor the BBC, David Wood summarized the circulating popular interpretations of the film as: \"The sense of postwar, anticommunist paranoia is acute, as is the temptation to view the film as a metaphor for the tyranny of the McCarthy era.\" Danny Peary in \"Cult Movies\" pointed out that the studio-mandated addition of the framing story had changed the film's stance from anti-McCarthyite to anti-communist. Michael Dodd of \"The Missing Slate\" has called the movie \"one of the most multifaceted horror films ever made\", arguing that by \"simultaneously exploiting the contemporary fear of infiltration by undesirable elements, as well as a burgeoning concern over homeland totalitarianism in the wake of Senator Joseph McCarthy's notorious communist witch hunt, it may be the clearest window into the American psyche that horror cinema has ever provided.\"\nIn \"An Illustrated History of the Horror Film\", Carlos Clarens saw a trend manifesting itself in science-fiction films, dealing with dehumanization and fear of the loss of individual identity, being historically connected to the end of \"the Korean War and the well-publicized reports of brainwashing techniques.\" Comparing \"Invasion of the Body Snatchers\" with Robert Aldrich's \"Kiss Me Deadly\" and Orson Welles' \"Touch of Evil\", Brian Neve found a sense of disillusionment rather than straightforward messages, with all three films being \"less radical in any positive sense than reflective of the decline of [the screenwriters'] great liberal hopes.\"\nDespite a general agreement among film critics regarding these political connotations of the film, actor Kevin McCarthy said in an interview included on the 1998 DVD release that he felt no political allegory was intended. The interviewer stated that he had spoken with the author of the novel, Jack Finney, who professed no specific political allegory in the work.\nIn his autobiography, \"I Thought We Were Making Movies, Not History\", Walter Mirisch writes: \"People began to read meanings into pictures that were never intended. \"The Invasion of the Body Snatchers\" is an example of that. I remember reading a magazine article arguing that the picture was intended as an allegory about the communist infiltration of America. From personal knowledge, neither Walter Wanger nor Don Siegel, who directed it, nor Dan Mainwaring, who wrote the script nor original author Jack Finney, nor myself, saw it as anything other than a thriller, pure and simple.\"\nDon Siegel spoke more openly of an existing allegorical subtext, but denied a strictly political point of view: \"[...] I felt that this was a very important story. I think that the world is populated by pods and I wanted to show them. I think so many people have no feeling about cultural things, no feeling of pain, of sorrow. [...] The political reference to Senator McCarthy and totalitarianism was inescapable but I tried not to emphasize it because I feel that motion pictures are primarily to entertain and I did not want to preach.\" Film scholar J.P. Telotte wrote that Siegel intended for pods to be seductive; their spokesperson, a psychiatrist, was chosen to provide an authoritative voice that would appeal to the desire to \"abdicate from human responsibility in an increasingly complex and confusing modern world.\"\nSubsequent adaptations.\nThree subsequent adaptations of \"The Body Snatchers\" have been made: \"Invasion of the Body Snatchers\" (1978), \"Body Snatchers\" (1993), and \"The Invasion\" (2007).\nAn untitled fifth adaptation from Warner Bros. was reported to be in development in 2017. David Leslie Johnson was signed to be the screenwriter.\nHome media.\nThe film was released on DVD in 1998 by U.S.-label Republic (an identical re-release by Artisan followed in 2002); it includes the Superscope version plus a 1.375:1 Academy ratio version. The latter is not the original full frame edition but a pan and scan reworking of the Superscope edition that loses visual detail.\nDVD editions exist on the British market (including a computer-colorized version), German market (as \"\"), and Spanish market (as ).\nSeveral Blu-ray Disc versions have been released, including two bare-bones Blu-ray Disc editions by Olive Films in 2012 and German company Al!ve (under the title ) in 2018. Sinister Films released a Blu-ray in Italy on March 18, 2014. This version, under the title , contained many special features, including an interview with lead actor Kevin McCarthy and the 1957 \"Studio One\" episode entitled \"The Night America Trembled\", an unreleased filmed reconstruction of the famous Orson Welles radio transmission \"War of the Worlds\", starring Ed Asner, James Coburn, and Warren Beatty. Olive Films subsequently released a special-edition Blu-ray in 2018, containing extensive bonus features including several featurettes, two audio commentaries, one with film historian Richard Harland Smith and a second with Kevin McCarthy and Dana Wynter, and filmmaker Joe Dante, and a 1985 archival interview with McCarthy.\nRelated works.\nRobert A. Heinlein had previously developed this subject in his 1951 novel \"The Puppet Masters\", written in 1950. \"The Puppet Masters\" was later plagiarized as the 1958 film \"The Brain Eaters\", and adapted under contract in the 1994 film \"The Puppet Masters\". A similar theme was used in the 1953 film \"Invaders From Mars\".\nSeveral thematically related works followed Finney's 1955 novel \"The Body Snatchers\", including Val Guest's \"Quatermass 2\" and Gene Fowler's \"I Married a Monster from Outer Space\".\nThe 1986 film \"Troll\" has a snippet of a movie seen on TV in which Spot (a dog) and Tweetie (a canary) are declared to be pod persons.\nA Looney Tunes parody of the film was released, entitled \"Invasion of the Bunny Snatchers\" (1992). The adaptation was directed by Greg Ford and places Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, Elmer Fudd, Yosemite Sam, and Porky Pig in the various roles of the story.\nIn 2018, theater company Team Starkid created the musical parody \"The Guy Who Didn't Like Musicals\", the story of a Midwestern town that is overtaken by a singing alien hivemind. The musical parodies numerous horror and musical tropes, while the main character also wears within the show a suit reminiscent of Bennell's wardrobe.\nThe May 1981 issue of \"National Lampoon\" featured a parody titled \"Invasion of the Money Snatchers\"; the gentile population of Whiteville is taken over by pastrami sandwiches from outer space and turned into Jews.\nThe Host segments of the \"Mystery Science Theater 3000\" episode \"The Giant Spider Invasion\" parody this film. In the episode, as Pearl, Brain Guy, and \"Professor Bobo\" are out camping, they end up discovering flowers that they nickname \"Zucchini Throw Pillows\" which are actually Body Snatcher Aliens in disguise. They end up getting sent to the Satellite of Love along with the titular movie, causing Pearl, Brain Guy, and all the Bots (except Mike and Bobo) to become affected. Per Mike's encouragement, Bobo manages to save everyone by destroying the mother body snatcher alien, killing all the aliens and turning everyone affected back to normal. But because Pearl missed out on the SOL Crew's reactions to the movie, she forces them to watch it again.\n\"\", a 1982 film with similar themes involving androids, is also largely set in a California town named Santa Mira.\nThe film was also parodied in the 2012 \"SpongeBob SquarePants\" episode \"Planet of the Jellyfish\" (referencing \"Planet of the Vampires\" and \"Planet of the Apes\") featuring characters from Bikini Bottom being replaced by alien clones in their sleep.\nThe film also inspired the 2025 Apple TV series \"Pluribus\", in which the entire world is rapidly dominated by an alien virus. The unaffected protagonist calls affected humans \"pod people.\"\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "74395", "revid": "196446", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=74395", "title": "Kenneth Patchen", "text": "American poet and novelist (1911-1972)\nKenneth Patchen (December 13, 1911\u00a0\u2013\u00a0January 8, 1972) was an American poet and novelist. He experimented with different forms of writing and incorporated painting, drawing, and jazz music into his works, which have been compared with those of William Blake and Walt Whitman.\nPatchen's biographer wrote that he \"developed in his fabulous fables, love poems, and picture poems a deep yet modern mythology that conveys a sense of compassionate wonder amidst the world's violence.\" Along with his friend and peer Kenneth Rexroth, he was a central influence on the San Francisco Renaissance and the Beat Generation.\nEarly years.\nBackground.\nPatchen was born in Niles, Ohio. His father, Wayne, worked in the nearby steel mills of Youngstown, which Patchen would reference in his poems \"The Orange Bears\" and \"May I Ask You a Question, Mr. Youngstown Sheet &amp; Tube?\" Patchen kept a diary from the age of twelve and read Dante, Homer, Burns, Shakespeare, and Melville.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;&lt;poem&gt;I remember you would put daisies\nOn the windowsill at night and in\nThe morning they'd be so covered with soot\nYou couldn't tell what they were anymore.&lt;/poem&gt;\u2014\u200a\nHis family included his mother Eva, his sisters Ruth, Magel, Eunice, and Kathleen, and his brother Hugh. In 1926, while Patchen was still a teenager, his younger sister Kathleen was struck and killed by an automobile. Her death deeply affected him and he would later pay tribute to her in his 1948 poem \"In Memory of Kathleen.\"\nPatchen first began to develop his interest in literature and poetry while he was in high school, and the \"New York Times\" published his first poem while he was still in college. He attended Alexander Meiklejohn's Experimental College (which was part of the University of Wisconsin), in Madison, Wisconsin, for one year, starting in 1929. Patchen had a football scholarship there but had to drop out when he injured his back. After leaving school, Patchen travelled across the country, taking itinerant jobs in such places as Arkansas, Louisiana, and Georgia.\nMarriage.\nNext, Patchen moved to the East Coast, where he lived in New York City and Boston. While in Boston, in 1933, he met Miriam Oikemus at a friend's Christmas party. At the time, Miriam was a freshman at Massachusetts State College in Amherst. The two kept in touch, and Patchen started sending her the first of many love poems. They soon fell in love and decided to get married. First Patchen took her to meet his parents in Youngstown. They were married on June 28, 1934, in nearby Sharon, Pennsylvania.\nDuring the 1930s the couple moved frequently between New York City's Greenwich Village and California, as Patchen struggled to make a living as a writer. Despite his constant struggle, his strong relationship with Miriam supported him and would continue to support him through the hardships that plagued him for most of his adult life. The couple moved to a cottage in Old Lyme, Connecticut, in 1947. In 1951, a few years after befriending the West Coast poet Kenneth Rexroth, the Patchens moved to the West Coast, living first in San Francisco and then moving to Palo Alto in 1957.\nHealth problems.\nIn 1937 Patchen suffered a permanent spinal injury, which was to give him pain, to varying degrees, for the rest of his life and which required multiple surgical procedures. In a letter to a friend from 1960, Patchen explained, \"In 1956 a spinal fusion [operation] (second of two operations) gave me relief and mobility (&amp; for the first time I was able to go about giving readings, and so on.\"\nBy this point, he and his wife had moved from San Francisco to Palo Alto to be closer to the Palo Alto Clinic, where both were receiving treatment. Then, in 1959, Patchen noted in the letter quoted above that another surgery at the Presbyterian Medical Center of San Francisco ended in disaster. He wrote, \"During [a] surgical procedure for my throat, and while under complete anesthesia, I suffered another slipped disc.\" Though he was heavily sedated during the procedure, Patchen suspected that he had been dropped at some point; in any event he was in considerably more pain afterward, and disabled for the rest of his life. In 1963, he sued his surgeon for medical malpractice and lost.\nAround this time, Jim Morrison paid for the publication of the \"Mt. Alverno Review\", a poetry anthology edited by his friend, Michael C. Ford, to help Patchen with medical expenses.\nPolitics.\nThroughout his life Patchen was a fervent pacifist, as he made clear in much of his work. He was strongly opposed to the involvement of the United States in World War II. In his own words, \"I speak for a generation born in one war and doomed to die in another.\" This controversial view, coupled with his physical immobilization, may have prevented wider recognition or success beyond what some consider a \"cult\" following.\nFinal years.\nPatchen lived out the final years of his life with his wife in their modest home on 2340 Sierra Court, in Palo Alto, where Patchen created many of his distinctive painted poems, produced while confined to his bed after his disastrous 1959 surgery inadvertently damaged his spine. He died in Palo Alto, on January 8, 1972. His wife, Miriam, died in March 2000, also in Palo Alto.\nCareer.\nWriting.\nPatchen's first book of poetry, \"Before the Brave\", was published by Random House in 1936. His earliest collections of poetry were his most political and led to his being championed, in the 1930s, as a \"proletariat poet\". This description, which Patchen rejected, never stuck, since his work varied widely in subject, style and form. As his career progressed, he continued to push himself into more and more experimental styles and forms, developing, along with writers such as Langston Hughes and Kenneth Rexroth, what came to be known as jazz poetry. He also experimented with his childlike \"painted poems,\" many of which were published posthumously in the 1984 collection \"What Shall We Do Without Us\".\nAfter the appearance of his first book, he and Miriam traveled to the Southwest and then moved to Hollywood in 1938, where he tried, unsuccessfully, writing film scripts and worked for the WPA. His next book of poems, \"First Will and Testament\", drew the attention of James Laughlin, who was then launching New Directions Publishing as a student at Harvard. Laughlin's decision to publish Patchen's work started a relationship that would last for the remainder of both men's careers. For a short time, in 1939, Patchen even took an office job working for New Directions. In addition to their professional relationship, Patchen and Laughlin also became good friends.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;&lt;poem&gt;\nThe lions of fire\nShall have their hunting in this black land\nTheir teeth shall tear at your soft throats\nTheir claws kill\nO the lions of fire shall awake\nAnd the valleys steam with their fury\nBecause you have turned your faces from God\nBecause you have spread your filth everywhere.&lt;/poem&gt;\u2014\u200a\nPatchen pioneered the \"drawing-and-poem form\" as well as the painting-and-poem form and produced over a thousand \"painted books\", special copies of his own works with original paintings on the covers. His many hundreds of drawings and paintings have been described as being reminiscent of those of Blake and Klee. During the course of a long and varied career, he also tried his hand at writing experimental novels, such as \"The Journal of Albion Moonlight\" and \"The Memoirs of a Shy Pornographer\", and the radio play \"The City Wears a Slouch Hat\". Patchen's \"Collected Poems\" was first published in 1969, just a few years before his death.\nPeers.\nOne of Patchen's biggest literary supporters was the novelist Henry Miller, who wrote a long essay on Patchen, entitled \"Patchen: Man of Anger and Light\", in 1946. In this essay, Miller wrote, \"Patchen's pacifism is closely tied to what he sees as the loss of innocence in society, the corrupted human spirit, and is often expressed with animals. Such is the case with the forbidding 'The Lions of Fire Shall Have Their Hunting.'\" Patchen also had a close, lifelong friendship with the poet E.E. Cummings, which began when they were both living in Greenwich Village in the 1940s. Patchen was also a close peer of the West Coast poet Kenneth Rexroth, who shared Patchen's antiwar radicalism and his interest in combining poetry readings with jazz accompaniment. The two poets began a correspondence in the late 1940s and continued it in the 1950s. Rexroth encouraged the Patchens to move to San Francisco in the early 1950s.\nInfluence.\nIn the 1950s, Patchen became a major influence on the younger beat poets, including Allen Ginsberg and Lawrence Ferlinghetti. Miriam Patchen recalled some of these young poets, including Philip Lamantia, Gary Snyder, and Michael McClure, visiting the Patchens' home in San Francisco to pay their respects. However, once the Beats' popularity grew, Patchen disliked being associated with them and was highly critical of their glorification of drug use and what he perceived to be a strong desire for media attention and fame. Patchen referred to \"Ginsberg and Co.\" and the media hype surrounding them as a \"freak show.\"\nAwards.\nIn 1936, soon after the release of his first book, Patchen was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship. In 1944, he won the Ohioana Award for his book \"Cloth of the Tempest\". He received the Shelley Memorial Award in 1954. He received a $10,000 grant for his contribution to American literature from the National Foundation on the Arts and Humanities in 1967.\nMusical collaborations and recordings.\nIn 1942 Patchen collaborated with the composer John Cage on the radio play \"The City Wears a Slouch Hat\". In the 1950s Patchen collaborated with the jazz bassist and composer Charles Mingus, reading his poetry with Mingus' group, but no recordings of the collaboration are known to exist.\nIn the late 1950s Moe Asch of Folkways Records recorded Patchen reading his poetry and excerpts from one of his novels. These recordings were released as \"Kenneth Patchen Reads with Jazz in Canada\" (1959), \"Selected Poems of Kenneth Patchen\" (1960), \"Kenneth Patchen Reads His Love Poems\" (1961), and \"The Journal of Albion Moonlight\" (1972). \"Kenneth Patchen Reads with Jazz in Canada\" (1959) was recorded in Vancouver the same week as a live performance for CBC Radio. The original record included a mimeographed pamphlet featuring poems and credits for the jazz group who played on the record, the Allan Neil Quartet. It was re-released on CD by Locust Music in 2004.\nIn 1964\u201365, the English composer David Bedford set an extract from Patchen's 1948 poem \"In Memory of Kathleen\" to classical music for the piece \"A Dream of the Lost Seven Stars\".\nIn November 2004 the Peter Br\u00f6tzmann Chicago Tentet presented \"A Homage to Kenneth Patchen\" at the Chicago Humanities Festival with Mike Pearson reading from \"The Collected Poems of Kenneth Patchen.\" A recording was released on the German jazzwerkstatt label entitled \"Be Music, Night\" in 2006. Musicians in the performance included Peter Br\u00f6tzmann (clarinets, alto and tenor saxes), Mats Gustafsson (baritone sax, bass clarinet), Ken Vandermark (baritone sax, clarinet), Joe McPhee (trumpet, alto sax), Jeb Bishop (trombone), Fred Lonberg-Holm (cello), Kent Kessler (bass) and Paal Nilssen-Love and Michael Zerang (drums). In 1984 Br\u00f6tzmann had recorded a solo dedication to Patchen for FMP titled \"14 Love Poems,\" a collection of short unaccompanied reed pieces that mirror textures and cadences found in the poet's love poems.\nOn January 21, 2008, El Records released the record \"Rebel Poets in America\", which included poetry readings with jazz accompaniment by both Patchen and Lawrence Ferlinghetti, including such Patchen classics as \"The Murder of Two Men by a Young Kid Wearing Lemon Colored Gloves\" and \"I Went to the City.\" Patchen made these recordings in collaboration with the musician Allyn Ferguson, who composed and arranged jazz accompaniment for each poem and also led the jazz ensemble.\nIn October 2011 the Claudia Quintet, with guest vocalists Kurt Elling and Theo Bleckmann, released an album on Cuneiform Records of Patchen's poetry set to music written by Claudia leader John Hollenbeck.\nCritical response.\nPatchen's work has received little attention from academic critics. However, a few scholars have published critical books on Patchen, including Raymond Nelson, Herbert P. Hogue, and Larry R. Smith. Also, a collection of essays on Patchen's work was edited by Richard Morgan for the book \"Kenneth Patchen: A Collection of Essays\" (1977).\nNotable book reviews provide a reasonably accurate gauge of the public response to Patchen's work when it was initially published. For instance, Patchen biographer Larry Smith notes that \"[the] initial reception to Patchen's \"First Will &amp; Testament\" was positive and strong.\" Smith notes that a reviewer from the \"New Republic\" compared the book to T. S. Eliot's \"The Waste Land.\" The book was also praised in reviews by Louis Untermeyer and John Peale Bishop. However, it received a notably negative review by Delmore Schwartz in \"Partisan Review\". Following this first negative review, Schwartz would remain one of Patchen's fiercest critics.\nIn response to Patchen's novel \"The Journal of Albion Moonlight\" (1941), prior to its publication, Henry Miller praised the work in the long essay \"Patchen: Man of Anger and Light\", which was published in book form in 1946. Also prior to the book's publication, Delmore Schwartz read the manuscript and claimed to be so offended by its controversial antiwar stance that he persuaded Patchen's publisher, New Directions, against publishing it. This forced Patchen to self-publish the book by subscription. Post-publication, the book's supporters included Miller, Robert Duncan, and James Laughlin; its detractors included Schwartz, Edmund Wilson, and Ana\u00efs Nin. Despite receiving a favorable review from William Carlos Williams in 1942, the novel's highly experimental style, limited release, and antiwar stance would guarantee it a very limited audience.\nIn 1943, Patchen's \"Cloth of the Tempest\" received largely negative reviews. One reviewer even accused Patchen of being \"naive,\" a common criticism aimed at his work, particularly regarding his fervent pacifist beliefs.\nIn the 1950s, Patchen received praise from the jazz critic Ralph Gleason for his jazz-poetry readings with the Chamber Jazz Sextet at the Blackhawk Club in San Francisco. Gleason wrote, \"I think [Patchen's reading] technique presents the possibilities of an entire new medium of expression\u2015a combination of jazz and poetry that would take nothing away from either form but would create something entirely new.\" When Patchen recorded his jazz-poetry readings, one of the resulting albums drew praise from the poet John Ciardi, who wrote that \"Patchen's poetry is in many ways a natural for jazz accompaniment. Its subject and its tone are close to those of jazz.\"\nIn 1958, Patchen's \"Selected Poems\" and his book \"When We Were Here Together\" received significant praise from the reviewer Frederick Eckman in \"Poetry\" magazine. Eckman favorably compared Patchen's work to that of the poet William Blake and singled out the poems \"Street Corner College,\" \"Do the Dead Know What Time It Is?,\" \"The Origin of Baseball,\" \"Fog,\" and \"The Character of Love Seen As a Search for the Lost\" as some of Patchen's best pieces. He called \"When We Were Here Together\" \"a beautiful book, inside and out.\" However, in the very same issue of \"Poetry\", the reviewer Robert Beum wrote a brief, negative review of Patchen's book \"Hurrah for Anything\", calling it dull and clich\u00e9d.\nPatchen's most important volume, \"The Collected Poems of Kenneth Patchen\", first published in 1968, received largely positive reviews. A reviewer for the \"New York Times\" called the book \"a remarkable volume\" and compared Patchen's work to that of Walt Whitman, Hart Crane, and D. H. Lawrence and also compared it to the Bible. In another review, the poet David Meltzer called Patchen \"one of America's great poet-prophets\" and called his body of work \"visionary art for our time and for Eternity.\" Like the \"Times\" reviewer, Meltzer also compared Patchen's work to that of Walt Whitman and to the Bible and also to the writing of William Blake.\nLegacy.\nAlthough he did not achieve widespread fame during his lifetime, a small but dedicated following of fans and scholars continue to celebrate Patchen's art. The University of California, Santa Cruz, hosts an archive of his work, entitled \"Patchenobilia,\" and many bookstores around the San Francisco Bay Area, Patchen's final home, continue to host jazz and poetry events which include his works.\nOn Jimmy Buffett's 1973 album \u00a0\"A White Sport Coat and A Pink Crustacean\", the single \"Death of An Unpopular Poet\" is claimed by Buffett to have been inspired by Patchen and fellow poet Richard Farina.\nBetween 1987 and 1991 there were Kenneth Patchen Festivals, celebrating his work, in Warren, Ohio, which encompasses the town of Niles, where Patchen was born and grew up. These festivals were sponsored by the Trumbull Art Gallery in collaboration with the University of California, Santa Cruz. The little street where he lived as a child was renamed Patchen Avenue by the town of Niles.\nIn 2007, Gallery 324 in the Galleria at Erieview in downtown Cleveland, Ohio, held a Kenneth Patchen Festival reception on April 13. Featured were Larry Smith of Bottom Dog Press, Doug Manson (SUNY, Buffalo) editor of Celery Flute Player (a Kenneth Patchen newsletter), numerous colorful Kenneth Patchen silkscreens on loan from the Trumbull Art Guild in Warren, and Douglas Paisley's paintings of The Journal of Albion Moonlight with text. The following day, at the same gallery M.L. Liebler and the Magic Poetry Band from Detroit accompanied readings by poets Chris Franke, Jim Lang, and others. Later that night, the festival moved uptown to The Barking Spider Tavern in the University Circle area for poetry readings accompanied by the Cleveland band The John Richmond All-Stars.\nIn 2011, Kelly's Cove Press published \"Kenneth Patchen: A Centennial Selection\", edited by Patchen's friend Jonathan Clark, in celebration of the centenary of Patchen's birth.\nIn April 2012, Allen Frost published the \"Selected Correspondence of Kenneth Patchen\", which includes letters between Patchen and James Laughlin, Lawrence Ferlinghetti, Henry Miller, Amos Wilder, Dylan Thomas, Thomas Wolfe and E.E. Cummings.\nA full-color collection of Patchen's photos and art, \"An Astonished Eye: The Art of Kenneth Patchen,\" by Jonathan Clark, was published by Artichoke Press and the University of Rochester Library in 2014.\nWorks.\nSources:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "74397", "revid": "51011396", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=74397", "title": "Massive Attack", "text": "English trip hop group\nMassive Attack are an English trip hop collective formed in 1988 in Bristol, England, by Robert \"3D\" Del Naja, Grant \"Daddy G\" Marshall, Adrian \"Tricky\" Thaws and Andrew \"Mushroom\" Vowles. The group currently consists of Del Naja, Marshall, and Thaws.\nThey released their debut album in 1991, \"Blue Lines,\" which has been included on numerous best-of lists and is generally considered the first album of the 'trip-hop' genre. The single \"Unfinished Sympathy\" was a chart hit in Europe, including number one on the Dutch Top 40, and was later voted the 63rd-greatest song of all time in a poll by \"NME\". In 1994, they released their second album, \"Protection\". Thaws left the band later that year to pursue a solo career. In 1998, they released their third album, \"Mezzanine\", giving them their first number one on the UK Albums Chart. \"Mezzanine\" also contains the top-10 single \"Teardrop\", which earned further recognition as the opening theme of the American television series \"House\". In 1999, Vowles left the band, with Del Naja and Marshall continuing as a duo. They further released the albums \"100th Window\" (2003) and \"Heligoland\" (2010). Thaws rejoined the group in 2016 for the release of their EP \"Ritual Spirit\".\nBoth \"Blue Lines\" and \"Mezzanine\" feature in \"Rolling Stone\"'s list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. The group have collaborated with several recurring guest vocalists, including Horace Andy, Shara Nelson, Tracey Thorn, Elizabeth Fraser, Sin\u00e9ad O'Connor, Damon Albarn and Hope Sandoval.\nMassive Attack's awards include a Brit Award for Best British Dance Act, two MTV Europe Music Awards, and two Q Awards. Their five studio albums have sold over 13 million copies worldwide. Massive Attack are also known for supporting several political, human rights and environmental causes.\nHistory.\nThe Wild Bunch and \"Any Love\" (1980s\u20131990).\nDJs Daddy G and Mushroom, and rappers Tricky and 3D met as members of partying collective the Wild Bunch in the early 1980s. One of the first homegrown sound systems in the UK, the Wild Bunch became dominant on the Bristol club scene in the mid-1980s.\nMassive Attack was created in 1988 as a spin-off quartet. Unsigned, the group (Mushroom, Daddy G, 3D and Tricky) put out \"Any Love\" as a single. It was co-produced by Bristol double-act Smith &amp; Mighty and featured the falsetto-voiced singer-songwriter Carlton McCarthy. In 1990, they committed to deliver six studio albums and a \"best of\" compilation to Circa Records. This record label became a subsidiary of, and was later subsumed into, Virgin Records, which in turn was acquired by EMI.\n\"Blue Lines\" and \"Unfinished Sympathy\" (1991\u20131993).\n3D co-wrote Neneh Cherry's \"Manchild\" in 1989. This working relationship continued with Cherry helping Massive Attack to record their first album \"Blue Lines\". Cherry's partner Cameron McVey was an executive producer of the album and became the group's first manager. Cherry and McVey provided financial support, via the Cherry Bear organisation, and the album was partly recorded in their house. The band used guest vocalists, interspersed with their own \"sprechgesang\" stylings, on top of what became regarded as an essentially British creative sampling production; a trademark sound that fused hip hop, soul, reggae and other eclectic references, both musical and lyrical. The album used vocalists including Horace Andy and Shara Nelson, a former Wild Bunch cohort. MC Willie Wee, also once part of the Wild Bunch, featured. Neneh Cherry sang backing vocals on environmentalist anthem, \"Hymn of the Big Wheel\". Co-production was also provided by Jonny Dollar.\n\"Blue Lines\" was released on 8 April 1991 on Virgin Records. The album has been retrospectively considered the first of the \"trip-hop\" genre and received critical acclaim.\nThat year they released \"Unfinished Sympathy\" as a single, a string-arranged track at Abbey Road studio, scored by Will Malone. The group temporarily shortened their name to \"Massive\" on the advice of McVey to avoid controversy relating to the Gulf War. They returned to being \"Massive Attack\" for their next single, \"Safe from Harm\".\n\"Protection\" and Melankolic (1994\u20131997).\nFor their second album, the band brought in Everything but the Girl's Tracey Thorn and Nicolette as vocalists and released \"Protection\" on 26 September 1994.\nWith McVey out of the picture, Massive Attack enlisted the production talents of former Wild Bunch Nellee Hooper to co-produce some songs on it, with Mushroom. Other tracks were co-produced by the Insects and 3D. A dub version, \"No Protection\", was released the following year by Mad Professor. \"Protection\" won a Brit award for Best Dance Act. The other collaborators on \"Protection\" were Marius de Vries and Craig Armstrong, a Scottish classical pianist.\nTricky decided to end his involvement with the band in 1995 in order to pursue a solo career. The crediting of Tricky's contribution for \"Blue Lines\" was also a source of friction. This was also the period of the release of Tricky's \"Maxinquaye\" and Portishead's \"Dummy\". The term \"trip hop\" was coined and was referred to by the media as part of the \"Bristol scene\".\nMassive Attack started a label in 1995 distributed by Virgin/EMI, Melankolic, and signed Craig Armstrong and a number of other artists such as Horace Andy, Lewis Parker, Alpha, Sunna, and Day One. The group espoused a non-interference philosophy that allowed the artists to make their albums in the way they wanted.\nThe same year, the Insects became unavailable for co-production and having parted ways with Nellee Hooper, the band were introduced to Neil Davidge, a relatively unknown producer who had an association with anonymous dance-pop outfit DNA. The first track they worked on was \"The Hunter Gets Captured by the Game\", a cover version sung by Tracey Thorn for the \"Batman Forever\" soundtrack. Initially, Davidge was brought in as engineer, but soon became producer.\nThe group increasingly fractured in the lead-up to the third album, Davidge having to co-produce the three producers' ideas separately. Mushroom was reported to be unhappy with the degree of the post-punk direction in which 3D, increasingly filling the production vacuum, was taking the band.\nThe group contributed to the film soundtrack of \"The Jackal\" in 1997, recording \"Superpredators (Metal Postcard)\", a song containing a sample of Siouxsie and the Banshees' \"Mittageisen\" and \"Dissolved Girl\", a new song with vocals by Sarah Jay (that was later remixed for the next album), which was featured at the beginning of the 1999 film \"The Matrix\", although it was not on the official soundtrack.\nLater that year, they released a single, \"Risingson\", from what would be their third album, \"Mezzanine\".\n\"Mezzanine\", \"Teardrop\", Vowles's departure and Marshall's absence (1997\u20132001).\n3D became the band's main producer in 1997 in the recording sessions that made \"Mezzanine\", Massive Attack's most commercially successful album, selling nearly four million copies. It featured Neil Davidge as a sound engineer and co-producer, and Horace Andy and Elizabeth Fraser as the main guest vocalists. During recording, Angelo Bruschini became their permanent lead guitarist both in a session capacity and live.\nThe lead single, after \"Risingson\", was \"Teardrop\", sung by Fraser of Cocteau Twins. The song was accompanied by a video directed by Walter Stern, of an animatronic singing fetus. Horace Andy sang on three songs, including \"Angel\". A track the band made for the film \"The Jackal,\" \"Dissolved Girl\", sung by Sarah Jay, was remixed for inclusion on the record.\n\"Mezzanine\" went on to win a Q Award for Best Album as well as being nominated for a Mercury Prize.\nTouring extensively, friction between Mushroom and the other band members came to a head. Mushroom was unhappy with the direction of the group and having to appear on tour. In 1999, Mushroom left the band.\nAround this time, 3D, with Davidge decamped into Ridge Farm studio with friends and band members of Lupine Howl (made up of former members of the band Spiritualized, including Damon Reece, who went on to be Massive Attack's permanent session drummer and one of two live drummers) towards a fourth Massive Attack LP, taking things even further into a rock direction. 2001 also saw the release of \"Eleven Promos,\" a DVD of Massive Attack's 11 music videos thus far, including \"Angel\", a \u00a3100,000+ promo.\nDespite having taken 3D's side after Mushroom's departure and participating in a webcast as a duo in 2000, Daddy G took a personal break from the band in 2001.\n\"100th Window\", Marshall's return and \"Collected\" (2002\u20132006).\nWith Daddy G temporarily no longer involved in the studio, Davidge and 3D steered \"LP4\" on their own. Enlisting the vocals of Sin\u00e9ad O'Connor and Horace Andy, \"100th Window\" was mastered in August 2002 and released in February 2003. Featuring no samples or cover versions, \"100th Window\" was not as critically well received in Britain as the other records, although the album received a warmer reception internationally, scoring a 75 out of 100 on review aggregation site Metacritic. The group collaborated with Mos Def on the track \"I Against I\", which appeared on the \"Special Cases\" single and the soundtrack for \"Blade II\". \"I Against I\" is also notable as the only track from the \"100th Window\" sessions that features a writing credit from Daddy G. \"100th Window\" sold over one million copies and was toured extensively (including Queen Square, Bristol\u2014a one-off sell out concert set up in the city centre park, which was seen as a homecoming).\n3D was arrested on allegations involving child pornography in 2003, which were reported widely in the media. 3D was soon eliminated as a suspect (although he was charged with ecstasy possession and unable to get a U.S. visa for a while) with Daddy G and fans offering their support. The arrest affected the beginning of the \"100th Window\" tour schedule.\n3D and Davidge agreed to an offer from director Louis Leterrier to score the entire soundtrack for \"Danny the Dog\", starring Jet Li, in 2005. Dot Allison, who had sung with the band on the \"100th Window\" tour, sang the end title track, \"Aftersun\". 3D and Davidge also scored the soundtrack for the \"Bullet Boy\" film, with 3D on the end title vocals.\nDaddy G started coming into the studio the same year, although little came of the material. He decided to instead work with a production duo, Robot Club, in another studio, feeling that he would be more free to develop tracks in the way he wanted. Meanwhile, 3D and Davidge recorded with a number of different singers as well as creating a track named \"Twilight\", for UNKLE's \"War Stories\" album. Later that year, Massive Attack decided to release their contractually obliged compilation album \"Collected\" in 2006. They released it with a second disc, made up of previously released non-album songs and unreleased sketches.\n\"Weather Underground\" / \"Heligoland\" (2007\u20132011).\n3D and Davidge scored three soundtracks in 2007: \"In Prison My Whole Life\" (which featured a track called \"Calling Mumia\" with vocals by American rapper Snoop Dogg), \"Battle in Seattle\" and \"Trouble the Water.\"\nMassive Attack hosted a charity benefit for the Hoping Foundation, a charity for Palestinian children in 2007. The next year, it was announced that Massive Attack were to curate the UK's Southbank Meltdown, a week-long event. It was suggested in interviews that this event would inspire Massive Attack back into action, having spent several years drifting towards the completion of their fifth studio album.\nLater that year, 3D and Daddy G headed to Damon Albarn's studios for some writing and jamming. Around this time, Davidge scored the soundtrack for a Paul McGuigan film, \"Push\" and in December, 3D completed the score for \"44 Inch Chest\" with the Insects and Angelo Badalamenti.\nDavidge and 3D got back together in 2009 with Daddy G to finish the fifth album, incorporating bits of the Albarn material. Later it was announced that the band were to headline the 2009 Bestival festival, and soon after that they were to tour the UK and Europe. In May, 3D's instrumental \"Herculaneum\", featured in the film \"Gomorra\", won an Italian award for Best Song. Later that month, 3D and Daddy G picked up a special Ivor Novello award for Outstanding Contribution to British Music.\nJonny Dollar died of cancer on 29 May 2009 aged 45, survived by his wife and four children. Dollar was the programmer and hands-on producer behind \"Blue Lines\", writing some of the melodies that were the basis for the string arrangements in \"Unfinished Sympathy\".\nTheir new EP, \"Splitting the Atom,\" was announced on 25 August 2009. The other new tracks on the EP were Tunde Adebimpe's \"Pray For Rain\", Martina Topley-Bird's \"Psyche\" and Guy Garvey's \"Bulletproof Love\". The latter two tracks appear as remixes of the album versions.\nThe fifth album was released on 12 November 2009, called \"Heligoland,\" after the German archipelago of Heligoland, after a previous project called \"Weather Underground\" was abandoned. 3D said \"I think it's got definitely a more organic feel\". The opening track, \"Pray For Rain\" featured guest vocals of TV on the Radio's Tunde Adebimpe. Damon Albarn, Martina Topley-Bird and Mazzy Star frontwoman Hope Sandoval also provide guest vocals on the album. 3D said in October 2010, to the Spinner website, that his plans were now for \"unorthodox\" releases of several EPs in 2011, rather than an album.\n\"Ritual Spirit\" EP and Tricky's return (2013\u20132019).\nIn a 2013 interview for his first solo art show since 2008, 3D confirmed that not only was new Massive Attack material in the works, but that rumours of a reunion with Tricky were true. Tricky had not been featured on a Massive Attack album since 1994's \"Protection.\"\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"The idea is to put a record out next year\", he says. \"We actually get on really well at the moment because we don't spend time in the studio together\", he says with a wry grin. \"Me and Tricky wrote some new tracks in Paris last year, which haven't seen the light of day yet \u2013 but that was fun. They should be on the next album.\"\u2014\u200a\nMassive Attack headlined at Secret Solstice, a new music festival in Reykjav\u00edk in June 2014. On 21 February 2015, it was confirmed through the Massive Attack Facebook page that they would be collaborating with Run the Jewels.\nAn iPhone application \"Fantom\" was released in 2016, developed by a team including 3D, which let users hear parts of four new songs by remixing them in real time, using the phone's location, movement, clock, heartbeat, and camera.\nThe group released a new EP on 28 January 2016, \"Ritual Spirit\", which includes the four songs released on Fantom. The EP was written and produced by 3D and new collaborator, Euan Dickinson. The album is Tricky's first credit with the band since \"Protection\" (1994) and his return to the band in 2016. \nIt was their first release since the 2011 \"Four Walls / Paradise Circus\" collaboration with Burial, and the first time since 1994 that Tricky had been featured on Massive Attack content. Scottish hip-hop group Young Fathers, London rapper Roots Manuva and singer Azekel also featured on the EP.\nMassive Attack previewed three new songs on 26 July 2016: \"Come Near Me\", \"The Spoils\", and \"Dear Friend\" on the Fantom iPhone application on which they previously previewed the four songs from the \"Ritual Spirit\" EP.\nThey released a new EP on 29 July 2016, \"The Spoils\", which includes \"The Spoils\" and \"Come Near Me\", both previewed on Fantom. The EP was written and produced by Daddy G, without 3D and Tricky's involvement. \"The Spoils\" features vocals from American singer-songwriter Hope Sandoval, and \"Come Near Me\" features British vocalist Ghostpoet. A music video for \"Come Near Me\", directed by Ed Morris, and featuring Kosovan actress Arta Dobroshi, was released the same day as the single. The video for \"The Spoils\", featuring Cate Blanchett and directed by Australian director John Hillcoat, was released on 9 August 2016.\nMassive Attack cancelled their appearance at the 2018 Mad Cool festival in Madrid because of sound bleed from Franz Ferdinand on a neighbouring stage. The festival offered several solutions to accommodate the band, but Massive Attack rejected them all.\nMassive Attack went on tour in 2019 to promote the 20th anniversary rerelease of \"Mezzanine\", billed as \"Mezzanine XX1\". The American tour dates, originally scheduled for April, were postponed to September due to illness in the band.\n\"Eutopia\" EP and audiovisual releases (2020\u2013present).\nMassive Attack released a political audiovisual EP in July 2020 called \"Eutopia\". The three-track fusion was created across five cities during the COVID-19 global lockdown period, and was partly formed by generative algorithmic visuals from AI art pioneer Mario Klingemann and collaborations with Algiers, Young Fathers and US poet Saul Williams. The conceptual project, co-written and produced by 3D and documentary filmmaker Mark Donne, featured strong arguments for global system change from UN Paris Climate Agreement author Christiana Figueres, founder of the Universal Basic Income Principle Professor Guy Standing and inventor of the US \"Wealth Tax\" policy Professor Gabriel Zucman. Each video ends with a quote from Thomas More's \"Utopia\".\nMassive Attack were scheduled to headline the 2022 edition of the Primavera Sound music festival in Barcelona, Spain, but an unnamed band member's serious illness forced the band to cancel its appearance with the rest of its European tour. Angelo Bruschini, who played guitar on \"Mezzanine\" and \"100th Window\" and had toured with the band since 1995, died of lung cancer on 23 October 2023.\nThe group played their first show in five years on 5 June 2024 in Gothenburg, Sweden, joined by guests Elizabeth Fraser, Horace Andy and Young Fathers, who all toured with the band during their European shows that summer. The same line-up played Bristol in August. Billed as a 'Climate Action Accelerator' gig, the group worked with local businesses to reduce the event's environmental impact. Around this time, Massive Attack announced their first American tour since 2019; again to feature Fraser, Andy and Young Fathers. However, on 11 October 2024, the group cancelled all the US dates less than a week before. They cited \"unforeseen circumstances\" as the reason.\nIn a December 2024 interview with \"NME\", 3D revealed plans to release new music next year that had been ready since 2020 but was held up by record label disputes. He also said the band rejected an offer to play Coachella 2025 because of its environmental impact. In September 2025, Massive Attack removed their music from Spotify in protest against Spotify CEO Daniel Ek's investment in artificial intelligence military company Helsing.\nMusical style.\nSome of their most noted songs have been without choruses and have featured dramatically atmospheric dynamics. They use distorted guitar crescendos, lavish orchestral arrangements and prominent looped/shifting basslines. Underpinned by high and exacting production values, sometimes using copious digital editing and mixing. The pace of their music has often been slower than prevalent British dance music of the time. These and other psychedelic, soundtrack-like and DJist techniques, formed their style which has often been emulated. Journalists described this sound as \"trip hop\" from the mid-nineties onwards. In an interview in 2006, Daddy G said, \"We used to hate that terminology \"trip-hop\" so bad,\" [laughs] \"You know, as far we were concerned, Massive Attack music was unique, so to put it in a box was to pigeonhole it and to say, 'Right, we know where you guys are coming from.'\"\nOther projects.\n'Fire Sale' exhibition.\nA solo exhibition of Del Naja's art was held at the Lazarides gallery in central London, from 24 May to 22 June 2013. The show's content spanned a period of over twenty years and featured many of the art pieces that Del Naja created for Massive Attack. Each piece, reinterpreted especially for the exhibition, was hand-printed and finished. The show also featured three one-off 'digital infinity mirrors', two of which contained phrases supplied by Reprieve that were extracted from drone pilot dialogues. Del Naja performed a DJ set during the opening night on 23 May 2013.\nMassive Attack and Adam Curtis.\nDel Naja conceived and designed an eight-night festival with filmmaker Adam Curtis\u2014in collaboration with UVA (United Visual Artists)\u2014that premiered in Manchester, UK in July 2013. The festival featured Curtis's film, unofficially titled \"The Plan,\" which was projected on a huge screen surrounding the audience, while music from Massive Attack was interweaved throughout the film. Del Naja, who orchestrated the film's soundtrack, described the experience as a \"collective hallucination\" and the film was also shown at the Manchester International Festival in July 2013. Music created by Del Naja for the festival became the score for a BBC production entitled \"HyperNormalisation\" in 2016.\nDel Naja and Adam Curtis teamed up in 2019 for a second time on a live show based on the band's Mezzanine album. The show challenged the idea of nostalgia and power, and featured machine learning GANS and deep fakes from Mario Klingemann, as well as new films from Curtis that were used to tell a narrative story. They were used as visuals for cover versions of non Massive Attack songs based on samples and loops that made up the album's identity.\nMezzanine DNA.\nIt was reported in April 2019 that Massive Attack had encoded \"Mezzanine\" into DNA to mark the 20th anniversary of the seminal 1998 album. The album has also been made available in the form of a matte black spray paint can. A limited number of spray cans will contain the DNA encoded audio within matte black paint and each can will contain approximately one million copies of the album. Addressing the novel storage method, Del Naja \u2013 who is also known as a graffiti artist as '3D' \u2013 said: \"It\u2019s a creative way to store your back catalogue, although DNA-encoded spray paint is unlikely to be adopted by street artists seeking anonymity\".\nActivism and politics.\nAnti-war advocacy.\nRobert Del Naja was critical of the policies of the UK government under Tony Blair. He was strongly opposed to the 2003 invasion of Iraq, and with fellow musician Damon Albarn personally paid for full-page advertisements against the war in the \"NME\" magazine.\nMassive Attack have worked with Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament and Stop the War Coalition, while also having helped fund a legal challenge to military intervention in international courts.\nHuman rights.\nMassive Attack curated the annual Meltdown festival on London's South Bank in 2008. During the two weeks of live performance, cinema and art, they worked with human rights lawyer Clive Stafford Smith and his organisation Reprieve which uses the law to enforce the human rights of prisoners.\nThe video shot by Adam Broomberg and Oliver Chanarin for the song \"Saturday Come Slow\", featuring Albarn, drew attention to the use of music in torture.\nMassive Attack donated all proceeds from their 2010 EP \"Atlas Air\" to War Child, a charity the band previously supported when they contributed to \"The Help Album.\"\nBritish politics.\nDel Naja, musicians Albarn and Brian Eno, and United Visual Artists contributed to a Greenpeace demonstration in 2007 against the renewal of the Trident nuclear programme that was held on board the Arctic Sunrise on the River Thames.\nOn the eve of the Bristol Mayor election, the band caused some surprise by endorsing independent millionaire and former Liberal Democrat George Ferguson, citing the need for a mayor who would help facilitate creative projects to the city, and wasn't simply following a party political agenda. Previously, Del Naja had openly criticised Ferguson for being a member of the Society of Merchant Venturers, an organisation dating back to the 16th century which had many connections with the Bristol slave trade.\nAlong with other public figures, Massive Attack signed a letter supporting Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn in the 2019 general election, describing him as \"a beacon of hope in the struggle against emergent far-right nationalism, xenophobia and racism in much of the democratic world\" and endorsed him in the 2019 UK general election.\nMassive Attack endorsed Carla Denyer for the 2024 general election, the co-leader of the Green Party, as MP for Bristol Central. They said \"General Election 2024 is an opportunity for #Bristol to consolidate its green reputation by electing an MP who is resolutely focused on #ClimateAction and unambiguous on the matter of genocide in #Gaza. @carla_denyer is that candidate.\"\nInternational politics.\nDel Naja and Thom Yorke of Radiohead threw an unofficial party at the occupied UBS building in the city of London in December 2011, in support for the international Occupy movement.\nDuring a concert in Istanbul in 2014, Massive Attack named those who died in anti-government protests at Gezi Park on the outdoor screen at their back with the following sentences: \"Their killers are still out there\" and \"We won't forget Soma\".\nMassive Attack cancelled a concert in June 2024 at the Black Sea Arena in Tbilisi, originally scheduled for 28 July, in response to the Georgian government's repression of the nationwide civil protests against law proposals that could have restricted freedom of press and LGBT rights in the country; in an official statement, the band explained their decision by writing quote, \"At this moment, performing at the state-owned Black Sea Arena could be seen as an endorsement of their violent crackdown against peaceful protests and civil society\".\nIsraeli\u2013Palestinian conflict.\nDel Naja and Marshall visited the Bourj el-Barajneh refugee camp in Lebanon in July 2014 to meet with Palestinian volunteers at an educational centre. The band's profit from the show in Byblos was donated to the centre. Massive Attack performed three shows in 2017 in support of Hoping, an organisation that helps raise money and supports projects for Palestinian youth in refugee camps in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank, Lebanon and Syria.\nMassive Attack have previously played three shows in Israel, but have boycotted it since 1999 \"as a form of non-violent pressure on Israel to end its brutal occupation of Palestine\". They have described their decision as \"not an action of aggression towards the Israeli people\", but \"towards the [Israeli] government and its policies\", arguing that \"the Palestinians [in Gaza and the West Bank] have no access to the same fundamental benefits that the Israelis do.\" Massive Attack co-signed an open letter in May 2020 urging Israel to end the blockade of the Gaza Strip.\nThe group publicly expressed their support to the music acts who had decided to boycott 2024 The Great Escape Festival in Brighton and Hove, in protest against the event's sponsor Barclays and its investments in companies supplying arms that were reportedly used by Israeli military forces in their invasion of the Gaza Strip.\nAfter the band Kneecap were criticized for displaying pro-Palestinian messages at Coachella in April 2025, Massive Attack published a statement supporting the group saying, \"Kneecap are not the story. Gaza is the story. Genocide is the story.\"\nThe band showed a clip of late Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar walking in a tunnel in the Gaza Strip in a backdrop video at a concert during the 2025 Lido Festival in Manchester. The display was criticized by Alex Gandler, deputy spokesperson for Israel's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, who said it was \"just disgusting...aligning themselves with the worst humans. Not even hiding their hatred anymore.\" Israeli activist and writer Hen Mazzig accused them of \"encouraging [sympathy] with Hamas\" and incitement. The band responded by threatening to sue Mazzig for defamation, and defended the clip, which was cut with scenes from Jean Cocteau's \"Orpheus\", as \"placement and implicit tone of horrified lament; that an individual of power can take people down into hell\". They also felt the criticism of the clip was selectively chosen from a broader montage of various issues and themes. Mazzig subsequently deleted the post.\nMassive Attack joined the \"No Music For Genocide\" campaign, which calls for their music to be removed from streaming platforms in Israel.\nDecarbonisation project.\nRobert Del Naja announced on 28 November 2019 that Massive Attack partnered with a research centre based at the University of Manchester to explore the music industry's climate impact. He wrote in a column in \"The Guardian\": \"the commissioning of the renowned Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research to map the full carbon footprint of typical tour cycles, and to look specifically at the three key areas where CO2 emissions in our sector are generated.\" This will include information about band travel and production, audience transport and venue. \"The resulting roadmap to decarbonisation will be shared with other touring acts, promoters and festival/venue owners to assist swift and significant emissions reductions.\"\nEnvironmentalism.\nMassive Attack donated the income from a Lincoln car commercial in 2010 to the clean up campaign after the Deepwater Horizon oil spill.\nSince October 2018, Massive Attack have also been supporting the climate activists of the Extinction Rebellion group, also known as XR, which conducted protests in London in October 2018 then April 2019. Massive Attack played a DJ set on 21 April for the Extinction Rebellion protesters in the heart of London in Marble Arch. In July and October 2019, the group protested in 60 other cities worldwide, Robert Del Naja providing a portable radio network using speakers in backpacks with receivers and transmitters for the campaigners in London.\nThe band published a report in 2021 they had commissioned from the Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research. The report examined the impact of live music on the environment and gave a set of recommendations for meeting the Paris agreement targets. Del Naja criticised the UK government for not doing more to meet the targets. Massive Attack became the first band globally to commit their touring companies to the UN \"Race to Zero\" \u2013 Paris 1.5 compatible emissions reductions schedule.\nThe band played a Bristol show named \"Act 1.5\" on 24 August 2024 with the goal of being a \"large-scale climate action accelerator\", blazing a \"trail for new standards of decarbonisation of live music.\" There were 25 different measures to minimise carbon, including giving extra benefits to local attendees and those travelling by train, powering the venue by renewable energy only, serving only plant-based foods and minimising waste through compostable plates and cutlery.\nOther.\nMassive Attack performed at a charity concert in Bristol for tsunami relief in 2005 with Adrian Utley and Geoff Barrow of Portishead.

Unlike the much larger Horseshoe Falls, of which approximately 90% is in Ontario, Canada, and 10% in the U.S. state of New York, the American Falls is entirely within the United States.\nCharacteristics.\nThe falls receive approximately 11% of the flow from Niagara River, with most of the rest going over Horseshoe Falls, from which it is separated by Goat Island. It has a straight-line crest width of about . If measured along the jagged lip of the falls, the crest is about long (but see coastline paradox). The torrent of water passing over the crest of the falls is about deep.\nThe height of the American Falls ranges between . This measurement is taken from the top of the Falls to top of the rock pile (talus). The height of the Falls from the top of the Falls to the river is .\nVisitors can view the falls from a steep angle on the American side, where it is possible to approach to within several meters of the edge of the falls. One can view the falls from the bank of the river, as well as on Goat Island and Luna Island, which are accessible by a pedestrian bridge that crosses the rapids of the Niagara River upstream from the falls. The falls are viewable head-on from the Canadian side in Niagara Falls, Ontario.\nThe ledge of the American Falls is shaped in a modified \"W\" form, caused by numerous rock falls over the past 150 years which have resulted in the huge mound of rock at its base. The most notable recent rockfall occurred in 1954 with the collapse of Prospect Point to the north.\nTo survey the rockfall and determine how to prevent the falls from becoming a series of rapids, the U.S.\u00a0Army Corps of Engineers blocked the flow of water over the American Falls from June to November 1969. Results conflict as to whether tourist attendance that season was higher or lower than normal. Attendance increases were likely due to the news the cataract was dried off; decreases in tourists could be attributed to people believing both cataracts (the American and Horseshoe Falls) were dewatered. By December 1969, water was flowing over the American Falls again. In the mid\u20111970s, it was decided not to make alterations to the rockwall, citing the trend to allow nature to take its course.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "74404", "revid": "1300019228", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=74404", "title": "Chewco", "text": "American company\nChewco Investments L. P. was a limited partnership associated with the Enron scandal, which resulted in the bankruptcy of Enron. It was named after the \"Star Wars\" character Chewbacca, because it was created to hide losses from the Joint Energy Development Investment Limited, known by its acronym \"JEDI\". Like Chewbacca, the Jedi Knights were prominent characters in \"Star Wars\".\nEnron created Chewco as a limited partnership which would help keep the JEDI project off its books. It wanted to buy out the California Public Employees\u2019 Retirement System\u2019s interest in JEDI, but it did not want to be forced, by accepted accounting principles, to consolidate JEDI in the Enron financial statements and thus reflect debt and/or financial losses. Enron wanted to keep JEDI afloat, but it needed a partner to take at least a 3% stake, or the partnership's results would have to be included in Enron's financial statements. Chewco was created to be that partner.\nThe Chewco structure did not meet the SPE consolidation rules. The three basic rules for nonconsolidation of an SPE require that the independent equity investor\u2014\nChewco appeared to meet these tests, because it was financed by an unsecured loan from Barclays Bank; in reality, however, the loan had been guaranteed by Enron stock held by Enron itself. Additionally, as investors became more wary of Chewco, Michael Kopper, an Enron employee who reported to CFO Andrew Fastow, took over the titular management role and was used to hide actual ownership. With Enron thus assuming practical control over Chewco, the structure did not meet an additional requirement for a non-consolidated SPE. More prosaically, this was one of many ways in which Enron \"cooked the books\", failing to disclose corporate debt that SEC regulations require to be disclosed.\nOver the course of three years, Kopper received between $1.5 and $2 million in management fees from Chewco, some of which was kicked back to Fastow in the form of checks written to members of his family. According to the report of the investigative committee chaired by William Powers Jr., Kopper did little actual work, aside from time spent manipulating the books. Chewco itself did little actual work other than moving funds from one account to another, and that was done with minor expenditure of labor by lower-level employees. After all was said and done, Enron used Chewco to report roughly $400 million in nominal profits, while concealing $600 million in debt.\nIn November 2001, accountants Arthur Andersen discovered a two-page letter detailing a side deal in which Enron put up cash collateral to ostensibly give Chewco the outside equity it required for SPE status. As part of the deal, JEDI was to make a $6 million distribution to a reserve account in order to secure part of the loan from Barclays. As a result, Barclays no longer had the money at risk. Since Fastow had created Chewco with exactly three percent outside equity, the Barclays loan left Chewco at least $6 million short of the threshold.\nBased on these discoveries, Andersen told former SEC enforcement chief Bill McLucas, who was leading the internal investigation into the matter, that Chewco and \"everything that touched Chewco\"\u2013including JEDI\u2013did not qualify for off-balance sheet treatment. As a result, Chewco and JEDI would have to be retroactively consolidated onto Enron's books, forcing Enron to restate its earnings all the way back to 1997, the date of Chewco's creation. It also emerged that Chewco would not have qualified as an SPE even if it met the equity requirement. Kopper was still employed at Enron at the time he took control of Chewco, and tried to disguise his role by putting his controlling stake in the hand of his domestic partner, Bill Dodson. The ensuing restatement was a primary catalyst for Enron's bankruptcy in December.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Yolo County was one of the original counties of California, created in 1850 at the time of statehood. As of the 2020 census, its population was 216,403. Its county seat is Woodland. Yolo County is included in the greater Sacramento metropolitan area in the Sacramento Valley.\nEtymology.\nIn the original act of 1850, the name was spelled \"Yola\". \"Yolo\" is a Patwin Native American name variously believed to be a corruption of a tribal name, \"Yo-loy\", meaning \"a place abounding in rushes\", the village of Yodoi, believed to be in the vicinity of Knights Landing, California, or the name of the chief of said village, \"Yodo\".\nHistory.\nYolo County was one of the original counties of California, created in 1850 at the time of statehood.\nGovernment.\nThe county is governed by a board of five district supervisors as well the governments of its four incorporated cities: Davis, West Sacramento, Winters, and Woodland.\nGeography.\nAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which (0.9%) is covered by water.\nTransportation.\nCounty roads.\nAddressing in Yolo County is based on a system of numbered county roads. The numbering system works in the following way:\nEach integer road number is generally apart, with letters occasionally designating roads less than apart. County roads entering urban areas generally become named roads once they cross a city boundary. Some examples include County Road 101 in Woodland being renamed Pioneer Avenue, and County Road 102 (also known as County Route E8) in Davis being named Pole Line Road.\nPort.\nThe Port of Sacramento, now known as the Port of West Sacramento, is an inland port in West Sacramento, California, in the Sacramento metropolitan area. It is northeast of San Francisco, and is centered in the California Central Valley, one of the richest agricultural regions in the world.\nCrime.\nThis table includes the number of incidents reported and the rate per 1,000 persons for each type of offense.\nPolitics.\nYolo is a strongly Democratic county in presidential and congressional elections. The last Republican presidential candidate to win a majority in the county was Dwight Eisenhower in 1952, which is the longest Republican drought for any California county. In fact, since 1928, Eisenhower's win in 1952 was the only time the county was carried by the Republican presidential nominee.\nYolo County has been somewhat more likely to elect Republican governors since then (Ronald Reagan carried the county in 1966, George Deukmejian in 1986, and Arnold Schwarzenegger in 2003 and 2006).\nIn the United States House of Representatives, Yolo County is split between California's 4th and 7th congressional districts, represented by Mike Thompson (D\u2013St. Helena) and Doris Matsui (D\u2013Sacramento), respectively.\nIn the California State Senate, the county is entirely with the 3rd Senate district, represented by Christopher Cabaldon.\nIn the California State Assembly, the county is entirely within the 4th Assembly district, represented by Cecilia Aguiar-Curry.\nIn June 1978, Yolo was one of only three counties in the entire state to reject Proposition 13 (the others being San Francisco and Kern).\nIn November 2008, Yolo was one of just three counties in California's interior in which voters rejected Proposition 8 to ban gay marriage. Yolo voters rejected Proposition 8 by a vote of 58.65 to 41.35%. The other interior counties in which Proposition 8 failed to receive a majority of votes were Alpine County and Mono County. In 2024, all three joined 11 other interior counties which voted in favor of Proposition 3, which repealed Proposition 8 and established an affirmative right to marriage in the constitution, with Yolo supporting Proposition 3 70.4% to 29.6%.\nDemographics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"US Census population/styles.css\"/&gt;\n2010.\nThe 2010 United States census reported that Yolo County had a population of 200,849.

{"id": "74411", "revid": "50772995", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=74411", "title": "Daria", "text": "Animated television series (1997\u20132002)\nDaria is an American teen animated sitcom created by Glenn Eichler and Susie Lewis Lynn. The series ran from March 3, 1997, to January 21, 2002, on MTV. It centers on the titular character, Daria Morgendorffer, an intelligent, cynical high school student, voiced by Tracy Grandstaff, who had voiced the character in Mike Judge's earlier animated series, \"Beavis and Butt-Head\".\nIt is a spin-off of \"Beavis and Butt-Head\", in which Daria appeared as a recurring character. Although Judge allowed the character to star in a spin-off, he had no involvement in the production of \"Daria\" himself, as he was busy working on \"King of the Hill\".\nPremise.\nThe series centers on Daria Morgendorffer, a smart, acerbic, and cynical teenage girl who, along with her best friend, aspiring artist Jane Lane, observes the world around her. The show is set in the fictional suburban American town of Lawndale, and is a satire of high school life, full of allusions to and criticisms of popular culture and social classes. As the show's eponymous protagonist, Daria, appears in most scenes with her immediate family (mother Helen, father Jake, and younger sister Quinn) and/or Jane. \nThe show is set during Daria's high school days and ends with her graduation and acceptance into college. The principal location used for the show (outside of the Morgendorffer home) is Lawndale High School, a public-education institution filled with flamboyant and dysfunctional characters. \nThe dynamics among the two lead characters changed during season four, when Jane began a relationship with Tom Sloane. Though Daria is hesitant to accept Tom at first, fearing she will lose her best friend, she and Tom find themselves becoming closer, culminating in a kiss in the season finale. The emotional and comedic turmoil among Jane, Tom, and Daria was the centerpiece of the TV movie \"Is It Fall Yet?\", and the relationship between Tom and Daria fueled several of season five's plotlines.\nThe plots of \"Daria\" largely concern a juxtaposition between the focal character's blunted, sardonic cynicism and the values/preoccupations of her suburban hometown of Lawndale. In a 2005 interview, series co-creator Glenn Eichler described the otherwise unspecified locale as \"a mid-Atlantic suburb, outside somewhere like Baltimore or Washington, D.C. They could have lived in Pennsylvania near the Main Line, though\". For comedic and illustrative purposes, the show's depiction of suburban American life was a deliberately exaggerated one. In \"The New York Times\", the protagonist was described as \"a blend of Dorothy Parker, Fran Lebowitz, and Janeane Garofalo, wearing Carrie Donovan's glasses. Daria Morgendorffer, 16 and cursed with a functioning brain, has the misfortune to see high school, her family, and her life for exactly what they are and the temerity to comment on it.\"\nOrigin.\nDaria Morgendorffer, the show's titular character, first appeared on MTV as a recurring character in Mike Judge's \"Beavis and Butt-Head\". MTV senior vice president and creative director Abby Terkuhle explained that when that show \"became successful, we ... created Daria's character because we wanted a smart female who could serve as the foil\". Daria's original design was created by Bill Peckmann while working for J.J. Sedelmaier Productions during \"Beavis and Butt-Head\"'s first season. During production of \"Beavis and Butt-Head\"'s final seasons, MTV representatives, wanting to bring in a higher female demographic to the channel, approached story editor Glenn Eichler, offering a spin-off series for Daria. In 1995, a five-minute pilot, \"Sealed with a Kick\", was created by Eichler and \"Beavis and Butt-Head\" staffer Susie Lewis (although written by Sam Johnson and Chris Marcil). Among 4 other animated pilots pitched to the channel, Daria performed the strongest in focus groups, especially among middle-school-aged participants\u2014a fact that bothered MTV initially, as they felt their core audience at the time was instead 18- to 24-year-olds. But after show staff argued that college students don't really watch much television, MTV approved a series order of 13 episodes; both Eichler and Lewis were signed onto the series as executive producers.\nThe voice of Daria, Tracy Grandstaff, originally got her start on MTV as a writer, and later was cast as a housemate on the of \"The Real World\". Following that experience, Grandstaff got to know the head of development at the network and from there, got a job as a staff writer for \"Beavis and Butt-Head.\"\n\"The beauty of MTV back in the day was that it had no money. Everything was done really cheap. I was one of a few writers, and the only female writer, on staff,\" Grandstaff explained.\n\"...So I was the default choice [for Daria]. Janeane Garofalo from The Ben Stiller Show [was a Daria influence] for sure, as well as my own personal inner dialogue from junior high and high school in Kalamazoo, Michigan\u2014and Sara Gilbert from \"Roseanne\", probably more than anyone.\"\nThe first episode of \"Daria\" aired on March 3, 1997, roughly nine months before \"Beavis and Butt-Head\" ended its original run. Titled \"Esteemsters\", the episode where established 16-year-old Texan Daria and her family's move from fictional Highland, the setting of \"Beavis and Butt-Head\", to the new series' equally fictional locale of Lawndale. As well as introducing Daria's parents and younger sister, Quinn, as primary supporting characters, the first episode also introduced Jane Lane, Daria's best friend and confidante. Other than a brief mention of Highland, \"Daria\" did not contain any references to \"Beavis and Butt-Head\".\nThe series ran for five seasons, with 13 episodes each in five years, as well as two TV movies and two TV specials. The first movie, \"Is It Fall Yet?\", aired on August 27, 2000, and took place between seasons four and five. MTV planned an abbreviated six-episode sixth season, but, at Eichler's request, this project was cut down to a second movie, \"Is It College Yet?\", which served as the series finale on January 21, 2002.\nProduction.\nNo other characters from \"Beavis and Butt-Head\" appeared on \"Daria\"; the only direct reference to them was in promotions. Co-creator Glenn Eichler, in an interview conducted after the series' run, stated:\nB&amp;B were very strong characters, with a very specific type of humor and very loyal fans, and of course they were instantly identifiable. I felt that referencing them in \"Daria\", while we were trying to establish the new characters and the different type of humor, ran the risk of setting up false expectations and disappointment in the viewers \u2013 which could lead to a negative reaction to the new show and its different tone. So we steered clear of B&amp;B in the early going, and once the new show was established, there was really no need to harken back to the old one.\nIn the TV movie \"Is It Fall Yet?\", several celebrities provided guest voices. MTV host Carson Daly played Quinn's summer tutor, Canadian pop punk songstress Bif Naked played Jane's art camp companion, and rock musician Dave Grohl played Jane's pretentious art camp host. Several songs by the band Foo Fighters (in which Grohl is frontman) were featured in the series.\nDuring \"Daria's\" production, Grandstaff, Eichler, and Lewis had intentions of making a show where women appeared to be smarter and have it directed toward its female viewers, along with giving a voice to individuals who did not feel like they fit in. In contrast to audience belief, \"Daria\" had less planning and the show was left to develop more naturally, especially regarding the types of relationships the main character, Daria Morgendorffer, would have. In addition to this, the creators wanted to capture and represent what high school was like during the time the show was made, while portraying the different cliques typically seen in TV shows with a high school setting.\nThe first realization of how much the crew became attached to making \"Daria\" was after a five-minute pilot was created, showing how realistic the main character seemed despite being a digital creation. The animation style aided with production by having an uncomplicated form of filming that made the angles and movements appear natural. Lewis recalled letting the storyboards in the early stages of mapping \"Daria\" out aid on how the show would look with animation. Each episode was set to have a processing and completion time be nine months in order to fit making scripts, recording voice actors, and creating storyboards.\nWhen describing why the show took longer than expected to be released on DVD after \"Daria\"'s debut, Eichler recalls: That\u2019s how long it took to clear all the music rights. It also had a lot to do with MTV. Every time they began working on the rights, they had another loopy hit, so their small home-entertainment division had to put their resources on getting that show out. I guess we sort of got under the wire right before \"Jersey Shore\"! \"Daria\" saw a resurgence in viewership in 2020 once the show became available on Paramount+. However, neither \"Is It Fall Yet?\" nor \"Is It College Yet?\" became available on Paramount+ or MTV's website, despite both films being crucial to the show's plot progression.\nEpisodes.\nThere have been 65 episodes of \"Daria\", spanning five seasons, each with thirteen episodes. The series first went into production with an unfinished pilot episode, titled \"Sealed with a Kick\". The first season was broadcast between March 3 and July 21, 1997, while season two was aired from February 16 to August 2, 1998; season three was shown from February 17 to August 18, 1999; season four from February 25 to August 2, 2000, and finally, season five between February 19 and June 25, 2001.\nThe series also includes two feature-length television films; the first, \"Is It Fall Yet?\", which aired between seasons four and five, and chronicles the lives of the characters during summer break, and the second film, \"Is It College Yet?\", which followed the fifth season, serving as the official finale to the series.\nTwo specials were also aired; \"Daria: Behind the Scenes\" was hosted by Janeane Garofalo and aired on February 18, 2000, one week prior to the season four premiere, and featured how the show was created, the making of the show, and the voices behind the characters. The second special, \"Look Back in Annoyance\", aired on January 14, 2002, and is a retrospective hosted by Daria and Jane and highlights all the major events from the series before the lead-up to the television film finale, which was aired one week later.\nMusic and licensing.\n\"Daria\"'s theme song is \"You're Standing on My Neck\", written and performed by female rock group Splendora. The band later created original themes for the two \"Daria\" TV movies, \"Turn the Sun Down\" (for \"Is It Fall Yet?\") and \"College Try (Gives Me Blisters)\" (for \"Is It College Yet?\"), along with some background music.\nThe show itself had no original score. Though elements from Splendora's theme were used on occasion, \"Daria\"'s incidental music was taken from pop music songs. Most of these were contemporary, inserted over exterior shots and some scenes, with rarely any story relevance or awareness from the characters. For example, one episode depicts characters dancing to Will Smith's \"Gettin' Jiggy wit It\" mere weeks after the song's release, whereas the sequence itself was designed and animated months earlier.\nSome story points were built around specific songs, such as in \"Legends of the Mall\", where Cyndi Lauper's \"Girls Just Want to Have Fun\" became a major plot point for a fantasy sequence. The closing credits also featured a licensed song on all but a few occasions, the lyrics or concept of which often reflected some aspect of the preceding episode.\nFor the 1998 and 1999 VHS releases of some \"Daria\" episodes, incidental music was replaced, and \"You're Standing on My Neck\" was only played over the closing credits. However, for the bonus episodes included on the DVD releases of the two TV movies, the music was removed almost entirely.\nIn the DVD release \"Daria: The Complete Series\", creator Glenn Eichler mentions in the notes that \"99 percent of the music has been changed, because the cost of licensing the many music bites we used would have made it impossible to release the collection (and for many years did).\" He compared it to an episode of \"The Twilight Zone\" where the astronaut comes home, and his wife can't figure out what's different about him, \"... until it dawns on her that instead of a cool song from 1997 playing ... it's some tune she's never heard. Yeah, it's just like that.\"\nThe song \"Heart's on Fire\" by 38 Special also enjoyed a brief comeback on some late 1990s radio stations because of the popularity of the series as well as the Amy Grant b-side hit \"I Love You\" (from her popular crossover album \"Unguarded\"), \"Silent Running\" by Mike and the Mechanics, and \"Stand and Deliver\" by Mr. Mister.\nReception.\n\"Daria\" premiered to positive reviews, with John J. O'Connor of \"The New York Times\" writing in March 1997, \"As far as MTV and \"Beavis and Butt-Head\" are concerned, \"Daria\" is an indispensable blast of fresh air.\" \"Daria\" continued to receive positive reviews during the course of its run and was one of MTV's highest rated shows, with the network's manager Van Toffler viewing the character as \"a good spokesperson for MTV, intelligent but subversive\".\nDuring the program's run on MTV, Daria was part of the Cool Crap Auction, giving an overview of the goods for auction and talking \"live\" to the winner of one prize. Daria and Jane also hosted MTV's \"Top Ten Animated Videos Countdown\", poking fun at MTV's cheap animation. At the end of the series run, she had an \"interview\" on the \"CBS Early Show\" with Jane Clayson. \"Daria\" received a ratings share between 1 and 2 percent, about 1 to 2 million viewers.\nG.J. Donnelly of \"TV Guide\", writing about the series' finale, lamented, \"I already miss that monotone. I already miss those boots. ... Even at its most far-fetched, this animated film approaches the teenage experience much more realistically than shows like \"Dawson's Creek\".\" On the same occasion, Emily Nussbaum wrote at \"Slate\" that \"the show is biting the dust without ever getting the credit it deserved: for social satire, witty writing, and most of all, for a truly original main character\". She particularly singled out for praise that all the characters were heading \"to very different paths in life, based on their economic prospects,\" giving the show an ambiguous end; \"[the finale is] a bit of a classic: a sharply funny exploration of social class most teen films would render, well, cartoonish.\"\nLegacy.\nIn 2002, \"TV Guide\" ranked Daria number 41 on its \"50 Greatest Cartoon Characters of All Time\" list. In December 2013, the newspaper \"The Daily Telegraph\" included Daria in its list of \"best female cartoon characters\". In November 2018, IndieWire named \"Daria\" as the fourth-best animated series of all time. In December 2023, \"Variety\" ranked \"Daria\" #91 on its list of the 100 greatest TV shows of all time.\nIn April 2017, in commemoration of the 20th anniversary of the series, co-creator Susie Lewis and character designer Karen Disher were contacted by the \"Entertainment Weekly\" magazine to reimagine the lives of the main characters 20 years after the events of the series. During that interview, Lewis admitted that she would \"love to bring Daria back to TV\".\nThe 2021 studio album \"Dariacore\" by Jane Remover was named after the series as the artist was a fan of it. Screenshots of the series were used as album covers. The album and its sequels have given rise to a music microgenre known as Dariacore.\n\"Jodie\" television movie.\nOn June 21, 2018, it was announced that a revived series titled \"Daria &amp; Jodie\" was one of many revival projects in development at MTV Studios (later called MTV Entertainment Studios), a production studio which intends to sell new series to over-the-top media services. The title was later changed to \"Jodie\". In May 2022, it was announced that \"Jodie\" would instead be an animated film that will air on Comedy Central and be animated by Awesome Inc. By March 2024, MTV Entertainment Studios dropped the completed film and indicated the producers may try to find a new studio to sell it to for distribution.\nBroadcast and home media.\n\"Daria\" ran from March 3, 1997, to January 21, 2002, on MTV. In August 1, 2016 (coinciding MTV's 35th anniversary of its original launch date), MTV's new, rebranded, nostalgia-themed, music video-aimed sister channel (formerly known as \"VH1 Classic\") aired reruns.\nOn May 28, 2002, Noggin issued a press release stating that \"Daria\" (and the TV film \"Is It Fall Yet?\") would begin airing as part of Noggin's primetime block for teenagers, The N, in July 2002. The series' Noggin run began on July 2, 2002, and ended on June 17, 2006.\nOn October 21, 1997, Sony Music released \"Daria\" on VHS, and on August 31, 1999, it also released \"Daria: Disfranchised\" also on VHS.\nIn July 2004, co-creator Glenn Eichler said of possible DVD releases, \"There's no distributor and no release date, but what there is is very strong interest from MTV in putting \"Daria\" out, and steady activity toward making that a reality\".\nBy July 2009, a DVD release for the series was planned for 2010. In January 2010, MTV released a teaser trailer on its website for \"Daria\"'s 2010 release. That May 11, \"Daria: The Complete Animated Series\" was released on DVD in North America by Paramount Home Entertainment. All 65 episodes and both TV movies are included in the set (\"Is It Fall Yet?\" is the full uncut version, while \"Is It College Yet?\" is a shorter TV edit; these were the versions that were released on their respective standalone DVDs in earlier years). Extras include the pilot episode, the music video \"Freakin' Friends\" by Mystik Spiral, \"Daria Day\" introductions as well as an animated top 10 music video countdown on MTV by Jane and Daria, cast and crew interviews, and a script for an unproduced Mystik Spiral spin-off show. The set, with all special features intact, was released on Region 4 PAL DVD on June 1, 2011. The Region 4 set was found to be encoded region free.\nIn June 2018, Hulu acquired rights to stream \"Daria\". Because of Disney's acquisition, the show was removed from Hulu at the end of September 2020 before it became available for streaming on CBS All Access (now known as Paramount+) in November 2020.\nMerchandise.\nGPS.\nIn late 2010, following the DVD release, \"Daria\" was licensed as a voice for Garmin and TomTom GPS systems; original putdowns and jokes were recorded.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "74416", "revid": "50041993", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=74416", "title": "Yarrow algorithm", "text": "Random number generator\nThe Yarrow algorithm is a family of cryptographic pseudorandom number generators (CSPRNG) devised by John Kelsey, Bruce Schneier, and Niels Ferguson and published in 1999. The Yarrow algorithm is explicitly unpatented, royalty-free, and open source; no license is required to use it. An improved design from Ferguson and Schneier, Fortuna, is described in their book, \"Practical Cryptography\"\nYarrow was used in FreeBSD, but is now superseded by Fortuna. Yarrow was also incorporated in iOS and macOS for their /dev/random devices, but Apple has switched to Fortuna since 2020 Q1.\nName.\nThe name \"Yarrow\" alludes to the use of the yarrow plant in the random generating process of I Ching divination. Since the Xia dynasty (c.\u20092070 to c.\u20091600 BCE), Chinese have used yarrow stalks for divination. Fortunetellers divide a set of 50 yarrow stalks into piles and use modular arithmetic recursively to generate two bits of random information\nthat have a non-uniform distribution.\nPrinciples.\nYarrow's main design principles are: resistance to attacks, easy use by programmers with no cryptography background, and reusability of existing building blocks. The former widely used designs such as ANSI X9.17 and RSAREF 2.0 PRNG have loopholes that provide attack opportunities under some circumstances. Some of them are not designed with real-world attacks in mind. Yarrow also aims to provide easy integration, to enable system designers with little knowledge of PRNG functionality.\nDesign.\nComponents.\nThe design of Yarrow consists of four major components: an entropy accumulator, a reseed mechanism, a generation mechanism, and reseed control.\nYarrow accumulates entropy into two pools: the fast pool, which provides frequent reseeds of the key to keep the duration of key compromises as short as possible; the slow pool, which provides rare but conservative reseeds of the key. This makes sure that the reseed is secured even when the entropy estimates are very optimistic.\nThe reseed mechanism connects the entropy accumulator to the generating mechanism. Reseeding from the fast pool uses the current key and the hash of all inputs to the fast pool since startup to generate a new key; reseeding from the slow pool behaves similarly, except it also uses the hash of all inputs to the slow pool to generate a new key. Both of the reseedings reset the entropy estimation of the fast pool to zero, but the last one also sets the estimation of the slow pool to zero. The reseeding mechanism updates the key constantly, so that even if the key of pool information is known to the attacker before the reseed, they will be unknown to the attacker after the reseed.\nThe reseed control component is leveraging between frequent reseeding, which is desirable but might allow iterative guessing attacks, and infrequent reseeding, which compromises more information for an attacker who has the key. Yarrow uses the fast pool to reseed whenever the source passes some threshold values, and uses the slow pool to reseed whenever at least two of its sources pass some other threshold value. The specific threshold values are mentioned in the Yarrow-160 section.\nDesign philosophy.\nYarrow assumes that enough entropy can be accumulated to ensure that the PRNG is in an unpredictable state. The designers accumulate entropy in the purpose of keeping the ability to recover the PRNG even when the key is compromised. Similar design philosophy is taken by RSAREF, DSA and ANSI X9.17 PRNGs.\nYarrow-160.\nThe Yarrow uses two important algorithms: a one-way hash function and a block cipher. The specific description and properties are listed in the table below.\nGeneration.\nYarrow-160 uses three-key Triple DES in counter mode to generate outputs. \"C\" is an \"n\"-bit counter value; \"K\" is the key. In order to generate the next output block, Yarrow follows the functions shown here.\nYarrow keeps count of the output block, because once the key is compromised, the leak of the old output before the compromised one can be stopped immediately. Once some system security parameter \"Pg\" is reached, the algorithm will generate \"k\" bits of PRNG output and use them as the new key. In Yarrow-160, the system security parameter is set to be \"10\", which means \"Pg \n 10\". The parameter is intentionally set to be low to minimize the number of outputs that can be backtracked.\nReseed.\nThe reseed mechanism of Yarrow-160 uses SHA-1 and Triple DES as the hash function and block cipher. The details steps are in the original paper.\nImplementation of Yarrow-160.\nYarrow-160 has been implemented in Java, and for FreeBSD. The examples can be found in \"An implementation of the Yarrow PRNG for FreeBSD\" by Mark R. V. Murray.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Each of the various realizations is called an alternant. The variation may be conditioned by the phonological, morphological, and/or syntactic environment in which the morpheme finds itself.\nAlternations provide linguists with data that allow them to determine the allophones and allomorphs of a language's phonemes and morphemes and to develop analyses determining the distribution of those allophones and allomorphs.\nThe term \"sound change\" refers to diachronic changes, which occur in a language's sound system. On the other hand, \"alternation\" refers to changes that happen synchronically (within the language of an individual speaker, depending on the neighbouring sounds) and do not change the language's underlying system.\nPhonologically conditioned alternation.\nAn example of a phonologically conditioned alternation is the English plural marker commonly spelled \"s\" or \"es\". This morpheme is pronounced , , or , depending on the nature of the preceding sound.\nAlternation related to meaning.\nMorphologically conditioned alternation.\nFrench has an example of morphologically conditioned alternation.

During the French Revolution, he, his two sons and their families migrated to the United States.\nHis son \u00c9leuth\u00e8re Ir\u00e9n\u00e9e du Pont was the founder of E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company. He was the patriarch and progenitor of one of the United States's most successful and wealthiest business dynasties of the 19th and 20th centuries.\nEarly life and family.\nPierre du Pont was born on 14 December 1739, the son of Samuel du Pont and Anne Alexandrine de Montchanin. His father was a watchmaker and French Protestant, or Huguenot. His mother was a descendant of an incredibly rich member of the long nose clan noble family from Burgundy.\nDu Pont married Nicole-Charlotte Marie-Louise le D\u00e9e de Rencourt in 1766, also of a minor noble family. They had three sons: Victor Marie (1767\u20131827), a manufacturer and politician; Paul Fran\u00e7ois (December 1769\u2013January 1770); and \u00c9leuth\u00e8re Ir\u00e9n\u00e9e (1771\u20131834), the founder of E.I. duPont de Nemours and Company in the United States. Nicole-Charlotte died 3 September 1784 of typhoid.\n\"Ancien R\u00e9gime\".\nWith a lively intelligence and high ambition, Pierre became estranged from his father, who wanted him to be a watchmaker. The younger man developed a wide range of acquaintances with access to the French court during the period. Eventually he became the prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Dr. Fran\u00e7ois Quesnay, the personal physician of King Louis XV's mistress, Madame de Pompadour. Quesnay was the leader of a faction known as the , a group of liberals at the court dedicated to economic and agricultural reforms. By the early 1760s, du Pont's writings on the national economy had drawn the attention of intellectuals such as Voltaire and Turgot. His 1768 book on physiocracy () advocated low tariffs and free trade among nations, deeply influenced Adam Smith of Scotland.\nIn 1768, he took over from Nicolas Baudeau, editor of ; he published in volume 6.\nHe was invited in 1774 by King Stanis\u0142aw August Poniatowski (Stanislaus II Augustus) of the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth to help organize that country's educational system. The appointment to the Commission of National Education, with which he worked for several months, helped push his career forward, bringing him an appointment within the French government.\nHe served as French inspector general of commerce under Louis XVI. He helped negotiate the treaty of 1783, by which Great Britain formally recognized the independence of the United States, and arranged the terms of a commercial treaty signed by France and England in 1786.\nIn 1784, he was ennobled by from Louis XVI (a process known as ), which added the ('of Nemours') suffix to his name to reflect his residence.\nFrench Revolution.\nDu Pont initially supported the French Revolution and served as president of the National Constituent Assembly.\nHe and his son Eleuth\u00e8re were among those who physically defended Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette from a mob besieging the Tuileries Palace in Paris during the insurrection of 10 August 1792. Condemned to the guillotine during the Reign of Terror, du Pont was awaiting execution when Maximilien Robespierre fell on 9 thermidor an IV (27 July 1794), and he was spared.\nHe married Fran\u00e7oise Robin on 5 vend\u00e9miaire an IV (27 September 1795). Robin was the daughter of Antoine Robin de Livet, a French aristocrat who lived in Lyon, and the widow of Pierre Poivre, the noted French administrator. After du Pont's house was sacked by a mob during the events of 18 Fructidor V (4 September 1797), he, his sons and their families immigrated to the United States in 1799.\nThey hoped (but failed) to found a model community of French exiles. In the United States, du Pont developed strong ties with industry and government, in particular with Thomas Jefferson, with whom he had been acquainted since at least 1787 and who had referred to him as \"one of the very great men of the age\" and \"the ablest man in France.\"\nDu Pont engaged in informal diplomacy between the United States and France during the reign of Napoleon. He was the originator of an idea that eventually became the Louisiana Purchase, as a way to avoid French troops landing in New Orleans, and possibly sparking armed conflict with U.S. forces. Eventually, he settled in the U.S. permanently; he died there in 1817.\nHis son \u00c9leuth\u00e8re, who had studied chemistry in France with Antoine Lavoisier, founded a gunpowder manufacturing plant, based on his experience in France as a chemist. It became one of the largest and most successful American corporations, known today as DuPont.\nIn 1800, he was elected a member of the American Philosophical Society in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania."}

The family moved to France in 1980 and Pozzi, then 19 years old, decided to stay in Rome.\nIn Rome, Pozzi started working as a model and studied acting. Sometimes she performed in television advertisements or as a walk-on in comedy movies. In 1981, she performed in her first hardcore movie, \"Valentina, ragazza in calore\" (\"Valentina, Girl in Heat\"), credited as Linda Heveret. A minor scandal ensued since, at the same time the movie was in theatres, she was still working on a children's television programme, \"Tip Tap Club\u200a\", on Rete 2. She denied being the same person, but was suspended from television anyway. This gave Pozzi her first popularity in newspapers and magazines. In 1985, Federico Fellini wanted her to perform in his movie \"Ginger and Fred\".\nCareer.\nPozzi performed in about 100 porn movies, mostly in Italy, but also some in Los Angeles with Gerard Damiano as director. She sold about 1 million videotapes. She was on the covers of 50 major magazines, not including pictorials in porn magazines. She was reportedly worth more than 50 billion lire (1990 prices), about 26 million euros.\nIn 1993 she worked as a runway model for the designer Chiara Boni, walking the catwalk for that year's autumn/winter collection. Boni said, \"Moana was something more than a pornstar, she went beyond very strong concepts.\" The following year she walked for Fendi.\nDeath and aftermath.\nIn 1994, Pozzi fell ill, unable to eat without vomiting, and losing weight. She took time off from work to travel with her husband Antonio Di Ciesco to India and then to France. She died in Lyon, France, on 15 September 1994, at the age of 33, reportedly of liver cancer. The cause of her death has been a subject of debate, with numerous suggestions being made, ranging from Pozzi being a spy for the KGB, killed by exposure to radioactive polonium, to dying from the result of assisted suicide orchestrated by her husband. In 2007, Di Ciesco, her husband, told a Rome newspaper he injected air into Moana's intravenous medicine drip after she sought his help to end her suffering.&lt;ref name=\"upi/82411176405303\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=\"italymagazine/porn-death\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Some people have questioned whether or not Pozzi died, and believe she may have faked her death to escape fame. In 2006, over a decade after her death, the Italian crime show \"Chi l'ha visto?\" aired her death certificate which showed she had indeed died of liver cancer, along with her cremation certificate, showing her ashes had been given to family members. Despite the release of paperwork and interviews with family members, the public and media has continued to speculate on how or if Pozzi died.\nIn 2006, Simone Pozzi revealed to the public that he was her son, not her brother as he had been raised to believe. As told by him, he was born in 1979, just a few weeks before his mother's 18th birthday, and was told growing up that his grandparents were his parents and that his mother was his older sister, to avoid the scandal of an out-of-wedlock birth in the family. Pozzi's mother confirmed the claims. Later that year, he, along with investigative journalist Francesca Parravicini, published a book about Pozzi's personality, career and relationships.\nLegacy.\nPozzi was a popular and beloved figure in Italy and made a name for herself outside of the pornography industry. Following her death, \"The New Yorker\" remarked on the country being in mourning as the result of her passing and the Archbishop of Naples gave a homily in her honor. In fact, she considered herself Roman Catholic. During her lifetime, Pozzi supported LGBT rights, denounced the Mafia, and campaigned for legalization of sex work. Upon her death, she left much of her fortune to cancer research. Since she remains a well-known figure in Italy, the Walt Disney Company made the decision to release the animated film \"Moana\" as \"Oceania\" in Italy and changed the title character's name to Vaiana for that localization.\nPozzi inspired the main character of the 1999 film \"Guardami\" (\"Look at Me\").\nIn 2009 a miniseries based on her life was directed by Alfredo Peyretti and starred Violante Placido in the title role.\nIn 2010 her former manager Riccardo Schicchi produced and directed \"I segreti di Moana\" (\"The Secrets of Moana\"), in which the title role was played by Vittoria Risi.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "74453", "revid": "599562", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=74453", "title": "Michael Dukakis", "text": "American politician and lawyer (born 1933)\nMichael Stanley Dukakis ( ; born November 3, 1933) is an American politician and lawyer who was governor of Massachusetts from 1975 to 1979 and from 1983 to 1991. He is the longest-serving governor in Massachusetts history and the second Greek-American governor in U.S. history, after Spiro Agnew. He was nominated by the Democratic Party for president in the 1988 election, losing to the Republican nominee, Vice President George H. W. Bush.\nBorn in Brookline, Massachusetts, to Greek immigrants, Dukakis attended Swarthmore College before enlisting in the United States Army. After graduating from Harvard Law School, he won election to the Massachusetts House of Representatives, serving from 1963 to 1971. He won the 1974 Massachusetts gubernatorial election but lost his 1978 bid for re-nomination to Edward J. King. He defeated King in the 1982 gubernatorial primary and was again governor from 1983 to 1991, presiding over a period of economic growth known as the \"Massachusetts Miracle\".\nBuilding on his popularity as governor, Dukakis sought the Democratic presidential nomination for the 1988 presidential election. He prevailed in the Democratic primaries and was formally nominated at the 1988 Democratic National Convention. Dukakis chose Senator Lloyd Bentsen of Texas as his running mate, while the Republicans nominated a ticket of George H. W. Bush and Senator Dan Quayle. Dukakis made history as the first Greek-American and Aromanian presidential candidate, first Greek Orthodox major-party nominee, and the first major-party nominee with ancestry outside Europe. Although he lost the election, carrying only ten states and Washington, D.C., he improved on the Democratic performances in the previous two elections. After the election, Dukakis announced that he would not seek another term as governor, and he left office in 1991. Since the death of Jimmy Carter in 2024, Dukakis is the oldest living presidential nominee.\nSince leaving office, Dukakis has served on the board of directors for Amtrak and taught political science at Northeastern University and UCLA. He was mentioned as a potential appointee to the Senate in 2009 to fill the vacancy caused by Ted Kennedy's death, but Governor Deval Patrick chose Paul G. Kirk. In 2012, Dukakis backed the successful Senate campaign of Elizabeth Warren, whom he also supported in the 2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries.\nEarly life and education.\nDukakis was born in Brookline, Massachusetts, on November 3, 1933. His father Panos was a Greek immigrant from Edremit in Turkey. Panos Dukakis settled in Lowell, Massachusetts, in 1912, and graduated from Harvard Medical School twelve years later, subsequently working as an obstetrician. Dukakis's mother Euterpe (n\u00e9e Boukis) was born in Larissa, to Aromanian parents from Vrysochori. She and her family emigrated to Haverhill, Massachusetts, in 1913.\nDukakis attended Brookline High School in his hometown, where he was an honor student and a member of the basketball, baseball, tennis, and cross-country teams. As a 17-year-old senior in high school, he ran the Boston Marathon. He graduated from Swarthmore College in 1955 with a Bachelor of Arts in political science. Although Dukakis had been accepted into Harvard Law School, he chose to enlist in the United States Army. After basic training at Fort Dix and advanced individual training at Camp Gordon, he was assigned as radio operator to the 8020th Administrative Unit in Munsan, South Korea. The unit was a support group to the United Nations delegation of the Military Armistice Commission Dukakis served from 1955 to 1957. He then received his J.D. degree from Harvard Law School in 1960. Dukakis is also an Eagle Scout and recipient of the Distinguished Eagle Scout Award from the Boy Scouts of America. Dukakis began his political career as an elected town meeting member in the town of Brookline. In 1963, he married Katherine \"Kitty\" Dickson (who adopted his surname), and they remained together until Kitty's death in March 2025.\nDukakis had a brother named Stelian, three years his elder. Michael looked up to Stelian as a child, but Stelian suffered a mental breakdown and attempted to commit suicide when Michael was seventeen years old. He was institutionalized for years afterward, but eventually became a teacher for the North Attleborough public school system, a professor at Boston State College, and an assistant city manager for the cities of Waltham and Malden. Despite his own career, Stelian developed a resentment for his brother's successes and unsuccessfully attempted to sabotage Michael's campaign for the Massachusetts House of Representatives in 1964, distributing anti-Michael Dukakis pamphlets in their hometown of Brookline. He also sought electoral office, running unsuccessfully twice for the Brookline Board of Selectmen and once in 1972 for the Massachusetts House of Representatives as a Republican. In 1973, Stelian was struck by a car while cycling, being critically injured and dying months later. Stelian's death had a significant impact on Dukakis.\nState legislature.\nDukakis served four terms in the Massachusetts House of Representatives between 1962 and 1970. In 1966, Dukakis unsuccessfully ran for Attorney General of Massachusetts. In 1970, Dukakis was the Democratic nominee for lieutenant governor on a ticket led by Boston mayor Kevin White. However, the Democratic ticket lost the 1970 gubernatorial election. After losing his bid for lieutenant governor, Dukakis returned to the private sector, practicing law and becoming a partner at Hill and Barlow.\nGovernor of Massachusetts.\nFirst term.\nDukakis was elected governor in 1974, defeating the incumbent Republican Francis Sargent during a period of fiscal crisis. Dukakis won in part by promising to be a \"reformer\" and pledging a \"lead pipe guarantee\" of no new taxes to balance the state budget. He would later reverse his position after taking office. He also pledged to dismantle the powerful Metropolitan District Commission (MDC), a bureaucratic enclave that served as home to hundreds of political patronage employees. The MDC managed state parks, reservoirs, and waterways, as well as the highways and roads abutting those waterways. In addition to its own police force, the MDC had its own maritime patrol force, and an enormous budget from the state, for which it provided minimal accounting. Dukakis's efforts to dismantle the MDC failed in the legislature, where the MDC had many powerful supporters. As a result, the MDC would withhold its critical backing of Dukakis in the 1978 gubernatorial primary.\nGovernor Dukakis hosted President Gerald Ford and Britain's Queen Elizabeth II during their visits to Boston in 1976 to commemorate the bicentennial of the United States. He gained some notice as the only politician in the state government who went to work during the Blizzard of 1978, during which he went to local TV studios in a sweater to announce emergency bulletins. Dukakis is also remembered for his 1977 exoneration of Sacco and Vanzetti, two Italian anarchists whose trial sparked protests around the world. During his first term in office, Dukakis commuted the sentences of 21 first-degree murderers and 23 second-degree murderers.\nHis first term performance proved to be insufficient to offset a backlash against the state's high sales and property tax rates, which turned out to be the predominant issue in the 1978 gubernatorial campaign. Dukakis, despite being the incumbent Democratic governor, was refused renomination by his own party. The state's Democratic Party chose to support Director of the Massachusetts Port Authority Edward J. King in the primary, partly because King rode the wave against high property taxes, but more significantly because state Democratic Party leaders lost confidence in Dukakis's ability to govern effectively. King also enjoyed the support of the power brokers at the MDC, who were unhappy with Dukakis's attempts to dismantle their powerful bureaucracy. King also had support from state police and public employee unions. Dukakis suffered a scathing defeat in the primary, a disappointment that his wife Kitty called \"a public death\".\nBetween governorships.\nFollowing his first governorship, Dukakis taught at Harvard University's John F. Kennedy School of Government. In 1980, Dukakis published his book \"State and Cities: The Massachusetts Experience\".\nSecond and Third terms.\nFour years later, having made peace with the state Democratic Party, MDC, the state police and public employee unions, Dukakis defeated King in a re-match in the 1982 Democratic primary. He went on to defeat his Republican opponent, John Winthrop Sears, in the November election. Future United States senator, 2004 Democratic presidential nominee, and US Secretary of State John Kerry was elected lieutenant governor on the same ballot with Dukakis, and served in the Dukakis administration from 1983 to 1985.\nDukakis served as governor during which time he presided over a high-tech boom and a period of prosperity in Massachusetts while simultaneously earning a reputation as a 'technocrat'. The National Governors Association voted Dukakis the most effective governor in 1986. Residents of the city of Boston and its surrounding areas remember him for the improvements he made to Boston's mass transit system, especially major renovations to the city's trains and buses. He was known for riding the subway to work every day as governor.\nIn 1988, Dukakis and Rosabeth Moss Kanter, his economic adviser in the 1988 presidential elections, wrote a book entitled \"https://\", an examination of the Massachusetts Miracle.\n1988 presidential campaign.\nPrimaries.\nUsing the phenomenon termed the \"Massachusetts Miracle\" to promote his campaign, Dukakis sought the Democratic Party nomination for President of the United States in the 1988 United States presidential election, prevailing over a primary field that included Jesse Jackson, Dick Gephardt, Paul Simon, Gary Hart, Joe Biden and Al Gore, among others. Composer John Williams wrote \"Fanfare for Michael Dukakis\" in 1988 at the request of Dukakis's father-in-law, Harry Ellis Dickson. The piece was premiered under the baton of Dickson (then the Associate Conductor of the Boston Pops) at that year's Democratic National Convention. Dukakis won the Democratic nomination, with 2,877 out of 4,105 delegates. He chose Senator Lloyd Bentsen of Texas to be his vice presidential running mate. Dukakis was pro-choice on the issue of abortion.\nDukakis made history as the first non-Western European American nominated for president by a major party, and was, until President Obama's nomination in 2008, the only major presidential nominee in history with ancestry from outside Northwestern Europe. Every United States presidential nominee except for Martin Van Buren (who was of entirely Dutch ancestry) has had ancestry from the British Isles. As the first ethnic Greek nominated for the presidency by a major party, Dukakis enjoyed strong support among the Greek American community. The Associated Press reported in April 1988 that there was an \"outpouring of pride in Dukakis\", which was especially strong and sentimental among older generations of Greek Americans. Dukakis stressed his working-class background as the son of impoverished immigrants, and his fluency in Greek among several other languages. Touching on his immigrant roots, Dukakis used Neil Diamond's ode to immigrants, \"America\", as the theme song for his campaign. This was seen as a sharp departure from his previous political campaigns in heavily white Massachusetts, in which the \"Washington Post\" reported that Dukakis rarely, if at all, made a point of his ethnicity (hence the reported colloquial saying \"I knew Michael Dukakis before he was Greek\"). Although George H.W Bush's campaign did not make a point of it in their attack ads, researchers and pollsters often discussed the vulnerability of Dukakis embracing his heritage. Conservative analyst William Schneider Jr. said that Dukakis' Greekness was the \"great unspoken issue\" of the election. The \"Post\" assessed that Bush's desirability as a WASP would inevitably make a victory more difficult for Dukakis in the long run.\nRegardless of community support, Dukakis had trouble with the personality that he projected to the voting public. His reserved and stoic nature was easily interpreted to be a lack of passion; Dukakis was often referred to as \"Zorba the Clerk\". Nevertheless, Dukakis is considered to have done well in the first presidential debate with George H.W. Bush, with \"The New York Times\" reporting, \"Democratic and Republican analysts generally agreed that Mr. Dukakis had turned in the better performance in the first of two Presidential debates, frequently managing to put Mr. Bush on the defensive.\" In the second debate, his performance was poor and played to his reputation as being cold.\nDuring the campaign, Dukakis's mental health became an issue when he refused to release his full medical history and there were, according to \"The New York Times\", \"persistent suggestions\" that he had undergone psychiatric treatment in the past. The issue gained further traction after a White House press conference, during which President Ronald Reagan flippantly referred to Dukakis as an \"invalid\". In the 2008 film \"\", journalist Robert Novak revealed that Republican strategist Lee Atwater had personally tried to get him to spread these mental health rumors. Editors at \"The Washington Times\" contributed to these rumors when they ran a story headlined \"Dukakis Kin Hints at Sessions\", suggesting that a member of the Dukakis family had said \"it is possible\" that Dukakis saw a psychiatrist. A week later the reporter, Gene Grabowski, revealed that \"Times\" editors had taken the full quote out of context. The full quote was \"It's possible, but I doubt it.\"\nDukakis's general election campaign was subject to several criticisms and gaffes on issues such as capital punishment, the pledge of allegiance in schools, and a photograph of Dukakis in a tank which was intended to portray him as a sound choice for commander-in-chief but which was widely perceived to have backfired. Like the allegations of psychiatric problems, these were vulnerabilities which Atwater identified and exploited. In 1991, shortly before his death from a brain tumor, Atwater apologized to Dukakis for the \"naked cruelty\" of the 1988 campaign.\nCrime.\nDuring the campaign, Vice President George H. W. Bush, the Republican nominee, criticized Dukakis for his traditionally liberal positions on many issues, calling him a \"card-carrying member of the ACLU\". Dukakis's support for a prison furlough program was a major election subject. During his first term as governor, he had vetoed a bill that would have stopped furloughs for first-degree murderers. During his second term, that program resulted in the release of convicted murderer Willie Horton, who committed a rape and assault in Maryland after being furloughed. George H. W. Bush mentioned Horton by name in a speech in June 1988, and a conservative political action committee (PAC) affiliated with the Bush campaign, the National Security Political Action Committee, aired an ad entitled \"Weekend Passes\", which used a mug shot image of Horton. The Bush campaign refused to repudiate the ad. It was followed by a separate Bush campaign ad, \"Revolving Door\", criticizing Dukakis over the furlough program without mentioning Horton. The legislature canceled the program during Dukakis's last term.\nTank photograph.\nDukakis was criticized during the campaign for a perceived softness on defense issues, particularly the controversial \"Star Wars\" program, which he promised to weaken. In response to this, Dukakis orchestrated what would become the key image of his campaign, although it turned out quite differently from what he intended. On September 13, 1988, Dukakis visited the General Dynamics Land Systems plant in Sterling Heights, Michigan, to take part in a photo op in an M1 Abrams tank. The prime minister of the United Kingdom, Margaret Thatcher, had been photographed in 1986 riding in a Challenger tank while wearing a scarf, which turned out very successfully and helped in her 1987 reelection. General Dynamics protocol requires one to wear the protective helmet for safety and communication when the tank is running at full speed, although Dukakis campaign staffers were aware that a politician putting on any headgear was a faux pas. A member of the press did photograph Dukakis without the helmet when the tank exited the garage at a slow speed, but the rest of the photographers snapped shots of Dukakis wearing a helmet when the tank made a high speed pass.\nThe image of Dukakis wearing a helmet while riding the tank was ridiculed by Bush and the media. The following week, a poll found that 25 percent of respondents said they were less likely to support him because of the tank ride. Footage of Dukakis in the tank was used in a television ad by the Bush campaign which aired during the World Series. The Dukakis campaign produced a 60-second response ad that featured a television set playing Bush's ad, which is flicked off the screen by a finger later revealed to be Dukakis as he proclaims that he is fed up with \"George Bush's negative TV ads\", but this \"pin-the-tail-on-the-donkey advertising\" only ended up drawing further attention to the tank ride.\nThe phrase \"Dukakis in the tank\" remains a shorthand for backfired public relations outings. In 2008, when asked about the photograph, Dukakis said \"Should I have been in the tank? Probably not, in retrospect. But these days when people ask me, 'Did you get here in a tank?' I always respond by saying, 'No, and I've never thrown up all over the Japanese prime minister'.\"\nResult.\nThe Dukakis/Bentsen ticket lost the election by a decisive margin in the Electoral College to George H. W. Bush and Dan Quayle, carrying only 10 states and the District of Columbia. Many believed he should have been campaigning across the country. During this time, his 17-point lead in opinion polls completely disappeared, as his lack of visibility allowed Bush to define the issues of the campaign. A large number of Democrats believed that the loss was to blame on Dukakis's delayed response to Bush and underestimating Bush's strength as a candidate. Dukakis has since stated that the main reason he lost was his decision \"not to respond to the Bush attack campaign, and in retrospect it was a pretty dumb decision.\"\nDespite Dukakis's loss, his performance was a marked improvement over the previous two Democratic efforts, both in the popular vote and the Electoral College. Though Bush still won a majority of the popular vote, Dukakis's margin of loss (7.8%) nationally was narrower than Jimmy Carter's in 1980 (9.7%) or Walter Mondale's in 1984 (18.2%), and earned 41.8\u00a0million votes nationally.\nDukakis made some strong showings in states that had voted for Republicans Ronald Reagan and Gerald Ford. He managed to pull off a close win in New York, which at the time was the second largest state in terms of electoral votes; he also scored victories in Rhode Island, Hawaii, his home state of Massachusetts, Oregon, and Washington. Walter Mondale had lost all six states, and since then, all six states have remained in the Democratic column at presidential elections. He swept Iowa, winning by 10 points in a state that had voted Republican in the last five presidential elections. His proportion of the popular vote would not be matched by any subsequent Democratic presidential candidate in South Dakota (46.51%), Kansas (42.56%), Oklahoma (41.28%), Wyoming (38.01%), or Idaho (36.01%).\nAlthough Dukakis cut into the Republican hold in the Midwest, he failed to dent the emerging GOP stronghold in the South that had been forming since the end of World War II with a temporary reprieve with Jimmy Carter (along with future President and Southern Democrat Bill Clinton, albeit to a much lesser extent). He lost most of the South by a wide margin, with Bush's popular vote margins exceeding 15% in most states. He carried most of the southern-central parishes of Louisiana, which was also his best Southern popular vote margin. His second-lowest Southern margin was Texas, where four overwhelmingly Mexican-American counties of South Texas delivered more than 81% of the vote to Dukakis, and were among his top five counties or county-equivalents nationally.\nIn 2008, Dukakis stated during an interview with Katie Couric that he \"owe[d] the American people an apology\" because \"if I had beaten the old man [i.e. George H. W. Bush], we never would have heard of the kid [i.e. George W. Bush], and we wouldn't be in this mess.\"\nPost-1988 political career.\nHis final two years as governor were marked by increased criticism of his policies and significant tax increases to cover the economic effects of the U.S. economy's \"soft landing\" at the end of the 1980s and the recession of 1990. He announced in early 1989 that he would not seek reelection to a fourth term.\nAfter the end of his term, Dukakis served on the board of directors for Amtrak, and became a professor of political science at Northeastern University, a visiting professor of political science at Loyola Marymount University, and visiting professor in the Department of Public Policy at the Luskin School of Public Affairs at UCLA. He had retired from his teaching roles by 2021. Along with a number of other notable Greek-Americans, he is a founding member of The Next Generation Initiative: a leadership program aimed at getting students involved in public affairs. In November 2008, Northeastern named its Center for Urban and Regional Policy after Michael Dukakis and his wife Kitty. Dukakis is a member of the ReFormers Caucus of Issue One. Dukakis retired from Northeastern at age 90 in 2024. \"Dukakis: Recipe for Democracy\", a documentary film about Dukakis's life as professor at Northeastern, premiered on October 22, 2024.\nIn August 2009, the 75-year-old Dukakis was mentioned as one of two leading candidates as a possible interim successor to Ted Kennedy in the U.S. Senate, after Kennedy's death. Instead, Gov. Patrick named Paul G. Kirk, the other leading candidate and favorite of the Kennedy family who promised not to run in the special election, to fill the seat.\nDukakis has also been an advocate for effective public transportation and high-speed rail as a solution to automobile congestion and the lack of space at airports; and for extended learning time initiative in public schools.\nDukakis stated on January 31, 2014, that he was not in favor of an effort to rename South Station as the \"Gov. Michael S. Dukakis Transportation Center\", although it was later renamed to that name. He went on to state that he would not object to the naming of the as-yet unbuilt North-South Rail Link after him.\nIn 2012, Dukakis worked to support the successful candidacy of fellow Democrat Elizabeth Warren to the U.S. Senate. During the 2016 Democratic Party presidential primaries, Dukakis endorsed the campaign of Hillary Clinton. Dukakis endorsed Setti Warren's unsuccessful 2018 candidacy for the Massachusetts Democratic gubernatorial nomination. Dukakis endorsed Elizabeth Warren's candidacy in the 2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries. He later endorsed Democratic nominee, Joe Biden during the general election. He and his wife also endorsed Ed Markey for reelection to his Massachusetts U.S. senate seat in 2020 during both the primary and general elections."}

{"id": "74456", "revid": "6603956", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=74456", "title": "Joe Lieberman", "text": "American politician and lawyer (1942\u20132024)\nJoseph Isadore Lieberman (; February 24, 1942 \u2013 March 27, 2024) was an American politician and lawyer who served as a United States senator from Connecticut from 1989 to 2013. Originally a member of the Democratic Party, he was its nominee for vice president of the United States in the 2000 presidential election. During his final term in office, he was officially listed as an Independent Democrat and caucused with and chaired committees for the Democratic Party.\nBorn in Stamford, Connecticut, Lieberman earned both Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Laws from Yale University. He was elected as a Democrat in 1970 to the Connecticut Senate, where he served three terms as majority leader. After an unsuccessful bid for the U.S. House of Representatives in 1980, he served as the Connecticut attorney general from 1983 to 1989. He narrowly defeated Republican Party incumbent Lowell Weicker in 1988 to win election to the U.S. Senate and was re-elected in 1994, 2000, and 2006. He was the Democratic Party nominee for vice president in the 2000 presidential election, running with presidential nominee and then Vice President Al Gore, and becoming the first Jewish candidate on a U.S. major party presidential ticket.\nGore and Lieberman lost the 2000 Presidential Election to the Republican George W. Bush\u2013Dick Cheney ticket, while winning the popular vote. He also unsuccessfully sought the Democratic nomination in the 2004 U.S. presidential election. During his Senate re-election bid in 2006, Lieberman lost the Democratic primary election but won re-election in the general election as a third party candidate under the Connecticut for Lieberman party label.\nLieberman was officially listed in Senate records for the 110th and 111th Congress as an Independent Democrat, and sat as part of the Senate Democratic Caucus. After his speech at the 2008 Republican National Convention in which he endorsed John McCain for president, he no longer attended Democratic Caucus leadership strategy meetings or policy lunches. The Senate Democratic Caucus voted to allow him to keep the chairmanship of the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs. Subsequently, he announced that he would continue to caucus with the Democrats. Before the 2016 election, he endorsed Hillary Clinton for president and in 2020 endorsed Joe Biden for president.\nAs senator, Lieberman introduced and championed the Don't Ask, Don't Tell Repeal Act of 2010 and legislation that led to the creation of the Department of Homeland Security. During debate on the Affordable Care Act (ACA), as the crucial 60th vote needed to pass the legislation, his opposition to the public health insurance option was critical to its removal from the resulting bill signed by President Barack Obama.\nEarly life.\nLieberman was born on February 24, 1942, in Stamford, Connecticut, the son of Henry, who ran a liquor store, and Marcia (n\u00e9e\u00a0Manger) Lieberman. His family is Jewish; his paternal grandparents emigrated from Congress Poland and his maternal grandparents were from Austria-Hungary.\nIn 1963, Lieberman traveled to Mississippi to work in support of the civil rights movement. He received a Bachelor of Arts in both political science and economics from Yale University in 1964, and was the first member of his family to attend college. At Yale, he was editor of the \"Yale Daily News\" and a member of the Elihu Club. His roommate was Richard Sugarman, who later went on to become a Professor of Philosophy and Religion at the University of Vermont and advisor to 2016 presidential candidate Bernie Sanders. Lieberman later attended Yale Law School, receiving his Bachelor of Laws in 1967. After graduation from law school, Lieberman worked as a lawyer for the New Haven-based law firm Wiggin &amp; Dana LLP.\nLieberman received an educational deferment from the Vietnam War draft when he was an undergraduate and law student from 1960 to 1967. Upon graduating from law school at age 25, Lieberman qualified for a family deferment because he was already married and had a child.\nEarly political career.\nLieberman was elected to the Connecticut Senate in 1970, where he served for 10 years, including the last six as Majority Leader. He suffered his first defeat in Connecticut elections in the Reagan landslide year of 1980, losing the race for the third district congressional seat to Republican Lawrence Joseph DeNardis, a state senator from suburban Hamden with whom he had worked closely on bipartisan legislative efforts. In 1981 he wrote an admiring biography of long-time Connecticut and national Democratic leader John Moran Bailey, reviewing also in the book the previous 50 years of Connecticut political history.\nFrom 1983 to 1989, Lieberman served as Connecticut Attorney General. In the 1986 general election, Lieberman won more votes than any other Democrat on the statewide ticket, including Governor William O'Neill. As Attorney General, Lieberman emphasized consumer protection and environmental enforcement.\nU.S. Senate.\nTenure.\nLieberman was first elected to the United States Senate as a Democrat in the 1988 election, defeating liberal Republican Lowell Weicker by a margin of 10,000 votes. He scored the nation's biggest political upset that year, after being backed by a coalition of Democrats and unaffiliated voters with support from conservative Republicans, most notably including \"National Review\" founder and \"Firing Line\" host William F. Buckley Jr. and his brother, former New York Senator James L. Buckley, who were disappointed in three-term Republican incumbent Weicker's liberal voting record and personal style. During the campaign, he received support from Connecticut's Cuban American community, which was unhappy with Weicker. Thereafter, Lieberman remained firmly anti-Castro.\nShortly after his first election to the Senate, Lieberman was approached by George J. Mitchell, the incoming Majority Leader who advised him, \"Pick out two or three areas that you're really interested in and learn them so that your colleagues know what you're talking about\u00a0... You're going to have more influence even as a freshman than you think because you know there's hundreds of issues and inevitably we rely on each other.\" Recalling the conversation, Lieberman said \"that was true when I first came in, although you could see partisanship beginning to eat away at that. But at the end of my 24 years, it was really so partisan that it was hard to make the combinations to get to 60 votes to break a filibuster to get things done.\"\nLieberman's initiatives against violence in video games are considered the chief impetus behind the establishment of an industry-wide video game rating system during the early 1990s.\nIn 1994, Lieberman made history by winning by the largest landslide ever in a Connecticut Senate race, drawing 67 percent of the vote and beating his opponent by more than 350,000 votes. Lieberman then served as chair of the Democratic Leadership Council from 1995 to 2001. In 1998, Lieberman was the first prominent Democrat to publicly challenge Clinton for the judgment exercised in his affair with Monica Lewinsky; however, he voted against removing Clinton from office by impeachment. Of his criticism of Bill Clinton, Lieberman said in 2014:\nIt was a very hard thing for me to do because I liked him but I really felt what he did was awful and that unless I felt myself if I didn't say something, I'd be a hypocrite. I also felt that if somebody who was supportive of him didn't say something, it would not be good. And so it got a lot of attention. I got a call from Erskine Bowles who was Chief of Staff about three or four days later saying that he was going to express an opinion which wasn't universally held at the White House\u00a0\u2013 he thought I helped the president by bursting the boil, that was the metaphor he used. The following Sunday morning, I'm at home and the phone rings, it's the White House. And it's now about a week and a couple of days since I made the speech. The president says, it was the president, \"I just want you to know that there's nothing you said in that speech that I don't agree with. And I want you to know that I'm working on it.\" And we talked for about forty-five minutes. It was amazing.\nIn 2000, Lieberman was elected to a third Senate term, defeating the Republican candidate, Philip Giordano.\nVice presidential campaign.\nLieberman's 2000 Senate campaign was concurrent with that year's presidential election. In August 2000, Vice President Al Gore announced that he had selected Lieberman as his vice presidential running mate. Lieberman became the first practicing Jew to run for the nation's second-highest office. Lieberman was selected from a group of potential running mates that reportedly included Senators John Kerry and John Edwards, the team that would form the Democratic presidential ticket four years later.\nLieberman had a reputation of being a more ideologically conservative Democrat than Gore. Because of Lieberman's criticism of Clinton's personal behavior, some viewed Gore's choice of Lieberman as a way to distance himself from the scandals of the Clinton White House. The Gore\u2013Lieberman ticket was defeated in a hard-fought election that was contested for weeks after the vote. On December 12, a U.S. Supreme Court ruling brought the race to an official end, confirming the decision in the favor of the Bush-Cheney ticket.\n2006 Senate election.\nPrimary.\nLieberman sought the Democratic Party's renomination for U.S. Senate from Connecticut in 2006 but lost to the comparatively more liberal Ned Lamont, a Greenwich businessman and antiwar candidate. Lamont received 33 percent of the delegates' votes at the Connecticut Democratic Convention in May, forcing an August primary.\nIn July, Lieberman announced that he would file papers to appear on the November ballot should he lose the primary, saying, \"I'm a loyal Democrat, but I have loyalties that are greater than those to my party, and that's my loyalty to my state and my country.\" He said he would continue to sit as a Democrat in the Senate even if he was defeated in the primary and elected on an unaffiliated line, and expressed concern for a potentially low turnout. On July 10, the Lieberman campaign officially filed paperwork allowing him to collect signatures for the newly formed Connecticut for Lieberman party ballot line.\nOn August 8, 2006, Lieberman conceded the Democratic primary election to Ned Lamont, saying, \"For the sake of our state, our country and my party, I cannot and will not let that result stand,\" and announced he would run in the 2006 November election as an independent candidate on the Connecticut for Lieberman ticket, against both Lamont and the Republican candidate, Alan Schlesinger.\nGeneral election.\nPolls after the primary showed Lieberman leading by varying margins. Alan Schlesinger barely registered support, and his campaign had run into problems based on alleged gambling debts. According to columnist Steve Kornacki, Lieberman was therefore \"able to run in the general election as the de facto Republican candidate\u00a0\u2013 every major Republican office-holder in the state endorsed him\u00a0\u2013 and to supplement that GOP base with strong support from independents.\"\nOn August 9, 2006, Hillary Clinton, the junior U.S. senator from New York, affirmed her pledge to support the primary winner, saying \"voters of Connecticut have made their decision and I think that decision should be respected\", and Howard Dean called for Lieberman to quit the race, saying he was being \"disrespectful of Democrats and disrespectful of the Democratic Party\". On August 10, in his first campaign appearance since losing the Democratic primary, referencing the 2006 transatlantic aircraft plot, Lieberman criticized Lamont, saying: \"If we just pick up like Ned Lamont wants us to do, get out [of Iraq] by a date certain, it will be taken as a tremendous victory by the same people who wanted to blow up these planes in this plot hatched in England. It will strengthen them and they will strike again.\" Lamont noted Lieberman's position was similar to George W. Bush and Dick Cheney's position. Lamont said, \"That comment sounds an awful lot like Vice President Cheney's comment on Wednesday. Both of them believe our invasion of Iraq has a lot to do with 9/11. That's a false premise.\" Lieberman's communications director replied that Lamont was politicizing national security by \"portraying [Lieberman] as a soul mate of President Bush on Iraq\".\nAs a Democrat, Lieberman earned an inordinate amount of support from some prominent conservatives in American politics. On August 17, 2006, the National Republican Senatorial Committee stated that they would favor a Lieberman victory in the November election over Democratic nominee Ned Lamont; however, the NRSC stated that they were not going so far as to actually support Lieberman. Former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani praised Lieberman at a South Carolina campaign stop on August 18, saying he was \"a really exceptional senator\". Five Democratic senators maintained their support for Lieberman, and Lieberman also received the strong support of former senator and Democratic stalwart Bob Kerrey, who offered to stump for him. Democratic minority leader Harry Reid, while endorsing Lamont, promised Lieberman that he would retain his committee positions and seniority if he prevailed in the general election. On August 28, Lieberman campaigned at the same motorcycle rally as Republican Congressman Christopher Shays. Shays told a crowd of motorcycle enthusiasts, \"We have a national treasure in Joe Lieberman.\" Mel Sembler, a former Republican National Committee finance chairman, helped organize a reception that raised a \"couple hundred thousand dollars\" for Lieberman, who was personally in attendance. Sembler is a prominent Republican who chaired I.\u00a0Lewis 'Scooter' Libby's legal defense fund. New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg held a fundraiser for Lieberman at his home in November, co-hosted by former mayor Ed Koch and former Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato. Koch called Lieberman \"one of the greatest Senators we've ever had in the Senate.\"\nDespite still considering himself a Democrat, Lieberman was endorsed by numerous Republicans who actively spoke out in favor of his candidacy. Lieberman was also the focus of websites such as ConservativesforLieberman06.com. On November 7, Lieberman won re-election with 50% of the vote. Ned Lamont garnered 40% of ballots cast and Alan Schlesinger won 10%. Lieberman received support from 33% of Democrats, 54% of independents and 70% of Republicans.\nCreation of Department of Homeland Security (DHS).\nWhen control of the Senate switched from Republicans to Democrats in June 2001, Lieberman became Chairman of the Governmental Affairs Committee, with oversight responsibilities for a broad range of government activities. He was also a member of the Environment and Public Works Committee and chair of its Subcommittee Clean Air, Wetlands and Private Property; the Armed Services Committee, where he chaired the Airland Subcommittee and sat on the Subcommittee on Emerging Threats and Capabilities; and the Small Business Committee. When Republicans gained control of the Senate in January 2003, Lieberman resumed his role as ranking minority member of the committees he had once chaired.\nLieberman was an early supporter of the creation of the Department of Homeland Security as the chairman of the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee, proposing organizing FEMA, the U.S. Customs Service, the U.S. Border Patrol, the U.S. Coast Guard, and other agencies under the new department. This proposal was eventually implemented in the Homeland Security Act of 2002.\nIn 2006, Senators Lieberman and Collins drafted legislation to reshape the Federal Emergency Management Agency into an agency that would more effectively prepare for and respond to catastrophes, including natural disasters and terrorist attacks. The legislation elevated FEMA to special status within the Department of Homeland Security, much like the Coast Guard and designated FEMA's head to be the president's point person during an emergency. The bill also called for the reunification of FEMA's preparedness and response functions, giving it responsibility for all phases of emergency management. In addition, the measure strengthened FEMA's regional offices, creating dedicated interagency \"strike teams\" to provide the initial federal response to a disaster in the region. The legislation passed Congress in September 2006.\nAs the 2007 hurricane season approached, Lieberman held an oversight hearing on implementation of the FEMA reforms on May 22, 2007. He urged FEMA to implement the reforms at a quicker pace. Lieberman was also involved in congressional oversight of the response to the H1N1 influenza (swine flu) pandemic and held four hearings on the subject in 2009, including one in Connecticut. At the hearings, he pressed the United States Department of Health and Human Services to distribute vaccines and antiviral medications at a quicker pace and to streamline the process. In the 110th Congress, Lieberman was Chairman of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, which is responsible for assuring the Federal Government's efficiency and effectiveness. He was also a member of the Environment and Public Works Committee; Senate Armed Services Committee, where he was Chairman of the Subcommittee on Air Land Forces and sat on the Subcommittee on Emerging Threats and Capabilities; and the Small Business Committee.\nFundraising.\nFrom 1989 onwards, Lieberman received more than $31.4\u00a0million in campaign donations from specific industries and sectors. His largest donors represented the securities and investment ($3.7\u00a0million), legal ($3.6\u00a0million), real estate ($3.1\u00a0million), and health professional ($1.1\u00a0million) industries.\nPresidential election involvement.\n2000.\nIn August 2000, Lieberman was selected as the nominee for Vice President of the United States by Al Gore, the Democratic Party nominee for president. Among the last round candidates were U.S. senators Bob Graham, John Kerry and John Edwards. The nomination committee was headed by Warren Christopher. Lieberman was the first Jewish candidate on a major political party ticket. Of the vetting process, Lieberman related a conversation in which Christopher told him the background checks would be \"like a medical procedure without an anesthesia.\"\nThe Gore\u2013Lieberman ticket won a plurality of the popular vote, with over half a million more votes than the Republican ticket of George W. Bush and Dick Cheney, but they were defeated in the Electoral College by a vote of 271 to 266 after an intense legal battle concerning the outcome in disputed counties (see \"Bush v. Gore\"). The US Supreme Court ruled that the Florida Supreme Court's ordered recount was unconstitutional and said that it defers to what it believes is the Florida Supreme Court's judgment that December 12 is the deadline for all recounts\u2014thus preventing a new recount from being ordered.\nLieberman decided to run for re-election to maintain his Senate seat, as vice-presidential candidates Joe Biden and Paul Ryan did for their senatorial and congressional seats respectively in 2008 and 2012. He won re-election and continued to serve in the Senate until his retirement in 2012.\n2004.\nOn January 13, 2003, Lieberman announced his intention to seek the Democratic nomination as a candidate in the 2004 presidential election. Lieberman campaigned on his experience in government as well as his centrist and hawkish positions. Indeed, he initially led in polls of primaries, but due to his political positions he failed to win a support of liberal Democratic voters, who dominated the primaries.\nPrior to his defeat in New Hampshire, Lieberman declared that his campaign was picking up \"Joementum\"; however, he failed to provide such momentum during the New Hampshire primary debates, held at Saint Anselm College days before the primary. On February 3, 2004, Lieberman withdrew his candidacy after failing to win any of the five primaries or two caucuses held that day. He acknowledged to the \"Hartford Courant\" that his support for the war in Iraq was a large part of his undoing with voters.\nLieberman's former running candidate Al Gore did not support Lieberman's presidential run, and in December 2003 endorsed Howard Dean's candidacy, saying \"This is about all of us and all of us need to get behind the strongest candidate [Dean].\" Finally, Lieberman withdrew from the race without winning a single contest. In total popular vote he placed 7th behind the eventual nominee, Massachusetts senator John Kerry; the eventual vice presidential nominee, North Carolina Senator John Edwards; former Governor of Vermont Howard Dean; Ohio Representative Dennis Kucinich; retired General Wesley Clark; and Reverend Al Sharpton.\n2008.\nOn December 17, 2007, Lieberman endorsed Republican Senator John McCain for president in 2008, going against his party and going back on his stance in July 2006 when he stated \"I want Democrats to be back in the majority in Washington and elect a Democratic president in 2008.\" Lieberman cited his agreement with McCain's stance on the war on terrorism as the primary reason for the endorsement.\nOn June 5, 2008, Lieberman launched \"Citizens for McCain\", hosted on the McCain campaign website, to recruit Democratic support for John McCain's candidacy. He emphasized the group's outreach to supporters of Hillary Clinton, who was at that time broadly expected to lose the Democratic presidential nomination to Barack Obama. Citizens for McCain was prominently featured in McCain team efforts to attract disgruntled Hillary Clinton supporters such as Debra Bartoshevich.\nLieberman spoke at the 2008 Republican National Convention on behalf of McCain and his running mate, Alaska Governor Sarah Palin. Lieberman was alongside McCain and Senator Lindsey Graham during a visit to French president Nicolas Sarkozy on March 21, 2008. Lieberman was mentioned as a possible vice presidential nominee on a McCain ticket. ABC News reported that Lieberman was McCain's first choice for vice president until several days before the selection, when McCain had decided that picking Lieberman would alienate the conservative base of the Republican Party. Lieberman had been mentioned as a possible Secretary of State under a McCain administration.\nMany Democrats wanted Lieberman to be stripped of his chairmanship of the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs due to his support for John McCain which went against the party's wishes. Republican Minority Leader Mitch McConnell reached out to Lieberman, asking him to caucus with the Republicans. Ultimately, the Senate Democratic Caucus voted 42 to 13 to allow Lieberman to keep chairmanship (although he did lose his membership for the Environment and Public Works Committee). Subsequently, Lieberman announced that he would continue to caucus with the Democrats. Lieberman credited President-elect Barack Obama for helping him keep his chairmanship. Obama had privately urged Democratic Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid not to remove Lieberman from his position. Reid stated that Lieberman's criticism of Obama during the election angered him, but that \"if you look at the problems we face as a nation, is this a time we walk out of here saying, 'Boy did we get even'?\" Senator Tom Carper of Delaware also credited the Democrats' decision on Lieberman to Obama's support, stating that \"If Barack can move on, so can we.\"\nSome members of the Democratic caucus were reportedly angry at the decision not to punish Lieberman more severely. The independent Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont stated that he voted to punish Lieberman \"because while millions of people worked hard for Obama, Lieberman actively worked for four more years of President Bush's policies.\" Lieberman's embrace of certain conservative policies and in particular his endorsement of John McCain have been cited as factors for his high approval rating among Republicans in Connecticut with 66% of Republicans approving of him along with 52% of independents also approving of his job performance; this is also cited for his mediocre approval rating among Democrats: 44% approving and 46% disapproving. In September 2018, Lieberman gave a eulogy at the funeral of John McCain, in which he stated that he had turned down a request to serve as McCain's 2008 running mate.\n2012, 2016, and 2020.\nIn April 2012, Lieberman announced that he would not make any public endorsements in the 2012 presidential election between President Obama and former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney. On August 10, 2016, Lieberman endorsed Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election. On September 13, 2020, Lieberman endorsed Democratic candidate Joe Biden in the 2020 presidential election.\nPolitical positions.\nLieberman was a strong advocate for the war in Iraq. He was also a strong supporter of the U.S.-Israel relationship. On domestic issues, he supported free trade economics while also reliably voting for pro-trade union legislation. As part of the Gang of 14, he opposed filibustering Republican judicial appointments. Lieberman was a supporter of abortion rights and of the rights of gays and lesbians to be protected with hate crime legislation, and to serve openly in the military. Lieberman was one of the Senate's leading opponents of violence in video games and on television. Lieberman described himself as being \"genuinely an Independent\", saying \"I agree more often than not with Democrats on domestic policy. I agree more often than not with Republicans on foreign and defense policy.\" Lieberman was known for his leadership in the successful effort to repeal the Don't ask, don't tell policy regarding sexual orientation in the U.S. Armed Forces.\nDuring debate on the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, Lieberman opposed the public option. As the crucial 60th vote needed to pass the legislation, his opposition to the public option was critical for its removal from the resulting bill. Lieberman was an integral part in attempting to stop WikiLeaks from publishing further material using U.S.-based corporations in the United States diplomatic cables leak of 2010. That same year, he joined Republican Senator Scott Brown and bipartisan House members Jason Altmire and Charlie Dent in introducing the Terrorist Expatriation Act, which proposed stripping citizenship rights from Americans who took arms against the United States or provided material support to enemy combatants. The bill received mixed reviews and was heavily criticized by some senior Democrats.\nIn June 2015, Lieberman was a signatory to a public letter written by a bipartisan group of 19 U.S. diplomats, experts, and others, on the then-pending negotiations for an agreement between Iran and world powers over Iran's nuclear program. That letter outlined concerns about several provisions in the then-unfinished agreement and called for a number of improvements to strengthen the prospective agreement and win the letter-writers' support for it. The final agreement, concluded in July 2015, shows the influence of the letter.\nIn May 2021, Lieberman expressed support for Israel in the Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict and praised \"the quiet and effective diplomacy of President Biden, who was not drawn in by the left of the Democratic Party to essentially take a stand against Israel.\"\nIraq War.\nLieberman was a supporter of the Iraq War and urged action against Iran. In July 2008, Lieberman spoke at the annual conference of Christians United for Israel (CUFI). In July 2009, he accepted CUFI's \"Defender of Israel Award\" from John Hagee. Pastor Hagee, CUFI's founder and leader, made a number of controversial remarks, including a statement that the Catholic Church is \"the great whore\" and a suggestion that God allowed the Holocaust to happen to bring the Jews to Israel.\nIslamic extremism.\nIn April 2010, Lieberman blasted President Obama for stripping terms like \"Islamic extremism\" from a key national security document, calling the move dishonest, wrong-headed, and disrespectful to the majority of Muslims who are not terrorists.\nFilibuster.\nWhile favoring the filibuster and threatening to use it in 2009 to eliminate a public health option as part of the healthcare proposal, Lieberman once strongly opposed the filibuster. In 1995, he joined with Senator Tom Harkin to co-sponsor an amendment to kill the filibuster. Lieberman told the \"Hartford Courant\": \"The filibuster hurts the credibility of the entire Senate and impedes progress.\"\nSurveillance.\nLieberman favored greater use of surveillance cameras by the federal government and referred to attempts by Congress to investigate illegal wiretapping as \"partisan gridlock\". On June 19, 2010, Lieberman introduced a bill called \"Protecting Cyberspace as a National Asset Act of 2010\", which he co-wrote with Senator Susan Collins (R-ME) and Senator Thomas Carper (D-DE). If signed into law, this controversial bill, which the American media dubbed the \"Internet kill switch\", would grant the President emergency powers over the Internet; however, all three co-authors of the bill issued a statement claiming that instead, the bill \"[narrowed] existing broad Presidential authority to take over telecommunications networks\". American computer security specialist and author Bruce Schneier objected to the \"kill switch\" proposal on the basis that it rests on several faulty assumptions and that it's \"too coarse a hammer\". However, Schneier also wrote: \"Defending his proposal, Sen. Lieberman pointed out that China has this capability. It's debatable whether or not it actually does, but it's actively pursuing the capability because the country cares less about its citizens. Here in the U.S., it is both wrong and dangerous to give the president the power and ability to commit Internet suicide and terrorize Americans in this way.\"\nWhistleblowing.\nLieberman was a major opponent of the whistleblowing website WikiLeaks. His staff \"made inquiries\" of Amazon.com and other internet companies such as PayPal, Visa, and MasterCard which resulted in them suspending service to WikiLeaks. Journalist Glenn Greenwald called Lieberman's actions \"one of the most pernicious acts by a U.S. Senator in quite some time,\" and accused Lieberman of \"emulat[ing] Chinese dictators\" by \"abusing his position as Homeland Security Chairman to thuggishly dictate to private companies which websites they should and should not host\u00a0\u2013 and, more important, what you can and cannot read on the Internet.\" Lieberman also suggested that \"\"The New York Times\" and other news organisations publishing the U.S. embassy cables being released by WikiLeaks could be investigated for breaking US espionage laws.\"\nAlong with Senators John Ensign and Scott Brown, Lieberman \"introduced a bill to amend the Espionage Act in order to facilitate the prosecution of folks like Wikileaks.\" Critics have noted that \"[l]eaking [classified] information in the first place is already a crime, so the measure is aimed squarely at publishers,\" and that \"Lieberman's proposed solution to WikiLeaks could have implications for journalists reporting on some of the more unsavory practices of the intelligence community.\" Legal analyst Benjamin Wittes called the proposed legislation \"the worst of both worlds\", saying:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nAs a result of these statements and actions, Lieberman was perceived as an opponent of Internet free speech and became the target of Anonymous attacks under Operation Payback.\nPost-Senate career.\nA survey in October 2010 showed that Lieberman had an approval rating of 31% and that just 24% of Connecticut voters felt he deserved re-election. Lieberman announced on January 19, 2011, that he would retire from the Senate at the end of his fourth term. Lieberman gave his farewell address on December 12, 2012. He was succeeded by Democratic representative Chris Murphy.\nFollowing his retirement from the Senate, Lieberman moved to Riverdale, Bronx, and registered to vote in New York as a Democrat. He became senior counsel of the white collar criminal defense and investigations practice at Kasowitz, Benson, Torres &amp; Friedman, a law firm in New York City whose notable clients include Donald Trump. In March 2013, it was announced that Lieberman would be joining the conservative American Enterprise Institute think tank as co-chairman of their American Internationalism Project, alongside former Republican Senator Jon Kyl. In February 2014, Lieberman was named as Counselor at the National Bureau of Asian Research. Additionally, he served as the Lieberman Chair of Public Policy and Public Service at Yeshiva University, where he taught an undergraduate course in political science.\nIn 2015, Lieberman served as co-chair of the Blue Ribbon Study Panel on Biodefense, a commission that recommended changes to U.S. policy regarding biodefense. In order to address biological threats facing the nation, the Blue Ribbon Study Panel on Biodefense created a 33 step initiative for the U.S. Government to implement. Lieberman headed the organization with former Governor Tom Ridge, and the Study Panel assembled in Washington, D.C., for four meetings concerning current biodefense programs. The Study Panel concluded that the federal government had inadequate defense mechanisms in case of a biological event. The Study Panel's final report, \"The National Blueprint for Biodefense\", proposes a string of solutions and recommendations for the U.S. Government to take, including items such as giving the vice president authority over biodefense responsibilities and merging the entire biodefense budget. These solutions represent the Panel's call to action in order to increase awareness and activity for pandemic related issues. In 2022, the group released a report recommending a $10 billion, 10-year program to prevent the next pandemic, in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nIn August 2015, Lieberman became chairman of the advocacy group United Against Nuclear Iran (UANI). In March 2016, Lieberman was hired by the Schaghticoke Tribal Nation to assist the group in challenging Connecticut laws giving exemptions to only the top two state gaming tribes to build casinos. That same year, Lieberman joined the Muslim-Jewish Advisory Council, an organization founded to address anti-Muslim and anti-Jewish bigotry in the United States. Lieberman was also on the advisory board of the Counter Extremism Project (CEP).\nIn early 2017, Lieberman introduced President elect Donald Trump's nominee as Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos to the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pension committee. One report on Lieberman's involvement was critical of him for failing to disclose in his testimony the extensive legal work his Kasowitz, Benson, Torres &amp; Friedman law firm had done for Donald Trump since at least as long ago as 2001. The work included bankrupt casino restructuring and, during the 2016 campaign, threatening \"The New York Times\" over publication of a few 1995 Trump tax documents.\nOn May 17, 2017, Lieberman was interviewed by President Donald Trump for the position of FBI Director, to replace recently fired James Comey. The interview took place against the background of the appointment of Special Counsel Robert Mueller to investigate issues connected to Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections. Speaking to reporters while meeting with Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos, Trump said he was \"very close\" to choosing a new FBI director to replace James Comey, and when asked if Lieberman was his top pick, Trump said yes. The President also stated that the odds were \"better than 50-50\" that his pick for FBI director would be made before he departed for his first trip abroad on Friday; however, no announcement was made publicly on Friday. On May 25, 2017, Lieberman officially withdrew his name from consideration.\nOn July 17, 2018, Lieberman published an opinion piece in \"The Wall Street Journal\" imploring people to vote for Joe Crowley, who was defeated in the Democratic primary by Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Crowley would run on the Working Families Party line, without support of a major party, similar to how Lieberman defeated Lamont in 2006. Lieberman continued to remain critical of Ocasio-Cortez, stating that \"With all respect, I certainly hope she's not the future, and I don't believe she is.\" In January 2019 Lieberman officially registered as a lobbyist working for ZTE but stated that his work for the corporation will be limited to assess national security concerns and will not include actual lobbying. In July 2022, Lieberman became one of the founding members of a group of U.S. business and policy leaders which shares the goal of engaging constructively with China and improving U.S.-China relations.\nA founding co-chairman of No Labels since its inception in 2010, Lieberman had helped to lead the group's efforts to promote bipartisanship in Congress. According to No Labels, Lieberman was \"called upon to weigh in on key internal decisions\" and serve as \"one of its primary spokespeople\". Reflecting on why he joined the group and subscribed to its mission of bipartisan problem-solving, Lieberman said, \"Early on, I learned that, in most all cases, you have to work across party lines to make things happen.\" In 2023, Lieberman wrote two opinion pieces in \"The Wall Street Journal\" asking people to consider supporting a No Labels unity presidential ticket in the 2024 presidential election. No Labels did surveys of thousands of voters to understand what they care about, concluding that most Americans are dissatisfied with both major political parties and that most of them supported having additional choices for president beyond the two major party nominees. No Labels secured ballot access in 24 states before ending its effort to find a unity ticket in April 2024 after the group could not find a candidate willing to lead the ticket.\nPersonal life and death.\nLieberman met his first wife, Betty Haas, at the congressional office of Senator Abraham Ribicoff (D-CT), where they worked as summer student interns. They married in 1965 while Joe Lieberman was in law school. They had two children\u00a0\u2013 Matt and Rebecca. Betty, who is also Jewish, later worked as a psychiatric social worker. In 1981, the couple divorced. When asked about the divorce in an interview with \"New York Magazine\", Lieberman said, \"one of the differences we had was in levels of religious observance\", adding, \"I'm convinced if that was the only difference, we wouldn't have gotten divorced.\"\nIn 1982, Lieberman met his second wife, Hadassah Freilich Tucker, while he was running for Attorney General of Connecticut. Hadassah Tucker's parents were Holocaust survivors. According to \"Washington Jewish Week\", Lieberman called her for a date because he thought it would be interesting to go out with someone named Hadassah. ( is the Hebrew name of Esther in the biblical Book of Esther, and subsequently also the name of the Women's Zionist Organization of America). From March 2005, Hadassah Lieberman worked for Hill &amp; Knowlton, a lobbying firm based in New York City, as a senior counselor in its health and pharmaceuticals practice. She held senior positions at the Hospital of Saint Raphael in New Haven, the American Committee for Shaare Zedek Medical Center in Jerusalem, Association of Public-Safety Communications Officials-International (APCO), Pfizer, National Research Council, Hoffmann-La Roche, and Lehman Brothers.\nJoe and Hadassah Lieberman had a daughter, Hana. In 2018, she immigrated to Israel with her family. Lieberman also had a stepson from Hadassah's previous marriage with Gordon Tucker, Ethan Tucker. Lieberman's son, Matt, graduated from Yale University and from Yale Law School. Matt is the former head of the school of Greenfield Hebrew Academy in Atlanta and was an unsuccessful candidate in the 2020 United States Senate special election in Georgia. Rebecca, Lieberman's daughter, graduated from Barnard College in 1991, and from the University of Pennsylvania Law School in 1997. Lieberman's stepson Ethan graduated from Harvard College in 1997 and received his rabbinic ordination from the Chief Rabbinate of Israel.\nLieberman described himself as an observant Jew. His first wife, Betty Haas, is a Reform Jew. After the death of his grandmother, a deeply religious immigrant, in 1967, he found a renewed interest in religious observance. His second wife, Hadassah, is also an observant Modern Orthodox Jew. \"Hadassah calls herself my right wing\", said Lieberman. In Lieberman's 1988 upset of Republican Party incumbent Senator Lowell Weicker, Lieberman's religious observance was mostly viewed in terms of refusal to campaign on the Shabbat. This changed when Al Gore chose Lieberman as the running mate; a Lieberman press officer who spoke on condition of anonymity said: \"He refers to himself as observant, as opposed to Orthodox, because he doesn't follow the strict Orthodox code and doesn't want to offend the Orthodox, and his wife feels the same way.\"\nThe Liebermans kept a kosher home and observed the Sabbath. In one notable instance, then-Senator Lieberman walked to the Capitol after Sabbath services to block a Republican filibuster. Lieberman said that there was currently \"a constitutional place for faith in our public life\", and that the Constitution does not provide for \"freedom from religion\". He attended Kesher Israel Congregation in Georgetown, Washington, D.C., and Beth Hamedrosh Hagodol\u00a0\u2013 B'nai Israel, The Westville Synagogue, New Haven, Connecticut. He also attended Congregation Agudath Sholom in his hometown of Stamford. Lieberman was an admirer of the last Lubavitcher Rebbe, Menachem Mendel Schneerson. He said of Schneerson, \"I was impressed by this man, by his obvious spirituality, by his soaring intellect, by the extent to which he was involved in the world.\" \nLieberman was the first person of Jewish background or faith to run on a major party presidential ticket. On March 27, 2024, Lieberman died at NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital, aged 82, from injuries that he sustained in a fall at his home in the Bronx. He received tributes from many, including from Presidents Joe Biden, Barack Obama, George W. Bush and Bill Clinton, Vice Presidents Kamala Harris, Mike Pence and Gore, Senators Tom Cotton and Lindsey Graham, and Israeli politicians Isaac Herzog and Benjamin Netanyahu. Lieberman is entombed in the cemetery at Congregation Agudath Sholom.\nAwards.\nIn 2008, Lieberman received the U.S. Senator John Heinz Award for Greatest Public Service by an Elected or Appointed Official, an award given out annually by Jefferson Awards.\nIn 2011, the National Defense University foundation honored Senators Lieberman and John McCain the American Patriot Award for their lifetimes of public service. They were recognized for their outstanding record of contributions to America's national security, armed forces and veterans throughout their impressive careers in government.\nIn 2011, Lieberman was awarded St. George Order of Victory by President of Georgia Mikheil Saakashvili for his support of Georgia following their 2008 war with Russia.\nPublished works.\nLieberman authored at least 10 books, including \"The Power Broker\" (1966), a biography of the late Democratic Party chairman John M. Bailey; \n\"The Scorpion and the Tarantula\" (1970), a study of early efforts to control nuclear proliferation; \n\"The Legacy\" (1981), a history of Connecticut politics from 1930 to 1980;\n\"Child Support in America: Practical Advice on Negotiating and Collecting a Fair Settlement\" (1986), a guidebook on methods to increase the collection of child support from delinquent fathers; \n\"In Praise of Public Life\" (2000); \n\"An Amazing Adventure: Joe and Hadassah's Personal Notes on the 2000 Campaign\" (2003), reflecting on his 2000 vice presidential run; \n\"The Gift of Rest: Rediscovering the Beauty of the Sabbath\" (2011), written with David Klinghoffer, \n\"With Liberty and Justice: The Fifty-Day Journey from Egypt to Sinai\" (2018), on a trip with Rabbi Ari D. Kahn, and \n\"The Centrist Solution: How We Made Government Work and Can Make It Work Again\" (2021).\nIn his book \"Ticking Time Bomb: Counter-Terrorism Lessons from the U.S. Government's Failure to Prevent the Fort Hood Attack\" (2011), he described Australian Muslim preacher Feiz Mohammad, American-Yemeni imam Anwar al-Awlaki, Muslim cleric Abdullah el-Faisal, and Pakistani-American Samir Khan as \"virtual spiritual sanctioners\" who use the internet to offer religious justification for Islamist terrorism.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Moore's work frequently addresses various social, political, and economic topics. He first became publicly known for his award-winning debut documentary \"Roger &amp; Me\", a scathing look at the downfall of the automotive industry in 1980s Flint and Detroit.\nMoore followed up and won the 2002 Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature for \"Bowling for Columbine\", which examines the causes of the Columbine High School massacre and the overall gun culture in the United States. He directed and produced \"Fahrenheit 9/11\", a critical look at the early presidency of George W. Bush and the war on terror, which earned $119,194,771 to become the highest-grossing documentary at the American box office of all time. The film won the Palme d'Or at the 2004 Cannes Film Festival, and was the subject of intense controversy. His documentary \"Sicko\" examines health care in the United States, and is one of the top ten highest-grossing documentaries as of 2020[ [update]]. In September 2008, he released his first free film on the Internet, \"Slacker Uprising\", which documents his personal quest to encourage Americans to vote in presidential elections. He has written and starred in \"TV Nation\", a satirical news-magazine television series, and \"The Awful Truth\", a satirical show. In 2018, he released his latest film, \"Fahrenheit 11/9\", a documentary about the 2016 United States presidential election and the presidency of Donald Trump. He was executive producer of \"Planet of the Humans\" (2019), a documentary about the environmental movement.\nMoore's works criticize topics such as globalization, big business, assault weapon ownership, Presidents Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, and Donald Trump, the Iraq War, the American health care system, and capitalism overall. In 2005, \"Time\" named Moore one of the world's 100 most influential people. Some critics have labeled Moore a \"propagandist\" and his films propaganda.\nEarly life and education.\nMichael Francis Moore (born April 23, 1954) in Flint, Michigan, and grew up in the nearby suburb of Davison, where he was raised by parents Veronica (\"n\u00e9e\" Wall), and Francis Richard \"Frank\" Moore, an automotive assembly-line worker. At that time, Flint was home to many General Motors factories, where his parents and grandfather worked. His uncle LaVerne was one of the founders of the United Automobile Workers labor union and participated in the Flint sit-down strike.\nMoore was brought up in a traditional Catholic home, and has Irish, and smaller amounts of Scottish and English, ancestry. Some of his ancestors were Quakers.\nMoore attended the parochial St. John's Elementary School, in John the Evangelist Parish, for primary school, and later attended St. Paul's Seminary in Saginaw, Michigan, for a year.\nHe then attended Davison High School, where he was active in both drama and debate. At the age of 18, he was elected to the Davison school board.&lt;ref name=\"nextcity/flint-in-washington\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; At the time he was the youngest person elected to office in the U.S., as the minimum age to hold public office had just been lowered to 18.&lt;ref name=\"nytimes/trouble-moore\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;\nMoore attended the University of Michigan\u2013Flint but dropped out during his second year.\nCareer.\n1977\u20131986: Journalism.\nAt age 22, Moore founded&lt;ref name=\"cnn/2004/07/05/fahrenheit\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; the alternative newspaper \"Free to Be...\", later renamed \"The Flint Voice\" (Burton, Michigan 1977\u20131982&lt;ref name=\"loc.gov/sn93023624\"&gt;*\nSinger-songwriter Harry Chapin is credited with being the primary benefactor in bringing about the bi-weekly newspaper's launch, by performing benefit concerts and donating the money to Moore. Moore crept backstage after a concert to Chapin's dressing room and convinced him to do a benefit concert. Chapin subsequently did a concert in Flint every year.\nIn April 1986, \"The Michigan Voice\" published its final issue as Moore moved to San Francisco.\nAfter four months at \"Mother Jones\" in 1986, Moore was fired in early September. Matt Labash of \"The Weekly Standard\" reported this was for refusing to print an article by Paul Berman that was critical of the Sandinista human rights record in Nicaragua. Moore refused to run the article because he believed it was inaccurate\nand would be used by the Reagan Administration against the Sandinistas. Speaking on the matter, Moore stated, \"The article was flatly wrong and the worst kind of patronizing bullshit. You would scarcely know from it that the United States had been at war with Nicaragua for the last five years.\" Chairman of the Foundation for National Progress (which owns \"Mother Jones\") Adam Hochschild said that Moore was fired due to performing poorly at his job. According to \"The New York Times\", senior staff members felt that Moore was \"rigidly ideological\".\nMoore has contended that \"Mother Jones\" fired him because of the publisher's refusal to allow him to cover a story on the GM plant closings in his hometown of Flint, Michigan. Moore responded by putting laid-off GM worker Ben Hamper, who also wrote for the same magazine at the time, on the magazine's cover. This act led to his termination. Moore sued for wrongful dismissal, and settled out of court for $58,000, providing him with some of the seed money,&lt;ref name=\"afi/Catalog/58258\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; with other fund raising efforts, including bingo games,&lt;ref name=\"encyclopedia/moore-michael-1954\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; for his first film, \"Roger &amp; Me\". Moore worked for Ralph Nader as the editor of a newsletter after being fired by \"Mother Jones\", which provided further financial support during this period.\n1989\u2013present: Directing, producing and screenwriting.\n\"Roger and Me\".\nThe 1989 film \"Roger &amp; Me\" was Moore's first documentary about what happened to Flint, Michigan, after General Motors closed its factories and opened new ones in Mexico where the workers were paid lower wages than their American counterparts. The \"Roger\" referred to in the title is Roger B. Smith, then CEO and President of General Motors.\nHarlan Jacobson, editor of \"Film Comment\" magazine, said that Moore muddled the chronology in \"Roger &amp; Me\" to make it seem that events that took place before G.M.'s layoffs were a consequence of them. Critic Roger Ebert defended Moore's handling of the timeline as an artistic and stylistic choice that had less to do with his credibility as a filmmaker and more to do with the flexibility of film as a medium to express a satiric viewpoint.\n\"Pets or Meat: The Return to Flint\".\nMoore made a follow-up 23-minute documentary film, \"\", that aired on PBS in 1992. It is based on \"Roger &amp; Me\". The film's title refers to Rhonda Britton, a Flint, Michigan resident featured in both the 1989 and 1992 films, who sells rabbits as either pets or meat.\n\"Canadian Bacon\".\nMoore's 1995 satirical film \"Canadian Bacon\" features a fictional U.S. president (played by Alan Alda) engineering a fake war with Canada to boost his popularity. The film is also one of the last featuring Canadian actor John Candy. Some commentators in the media felt the film was influenced by the Stanley Kubrick film \"Dr. Strangelove.\"\n\"The Big One\".\nMoore's 1997 film \"The Big One\" documents the tour publicizing Moore's book \"Downsize This! Random Threats from an Unarmed American,\" in which he criticizes mass layoffs despite record corporate profits. Among others, he targets Nike for outsourcing shoe production to Indonesia.\n\"Bowling for Columbine\".\nHis documentary \"Bowling for Columbine\", released in 2002, probes the culture of guns and violence in the United States, taking, as a starting point, the Columbine High School massacre of 1999. \"Bowling for Columbine\" won the Anniversary Prize at the 2002 Cannes Film Festival and France's C\u00e9sar Award as the Best Foreign Film. In the United States, it won the 2002 Academy Award for Documentary Feature. It also enjoyed great commercial and critical success for a film of its type, and has since gone on to be considered one of the greatest documentary films of all-time. At the time of \"Columbine\"'s release, it was the highest-grossing mainstream-released documentary (a record now held by Moore's \"Fahrenheit 9/11\").\nShortly after winning the Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature for \"Bowling for Columbine\", Moore spoke out against U.S. President George W. Bush and the Iraq War, which had just started three days prior. He further criticized the president by stating, \"We live in a time where we have fictitious election results that elects a fictitious president. We live in a time where we have a man sending us to war for fictitious reasons.\" The speech was received with a cacophony of boos, applause, and standing ovations from the audience at the theater. Moments after the speech concluded, to lighten the mood, host Steve Martin joked, \"The Teamsters are helping Michael Moore into the trunk of his limo.\"\n\"Fahrenheit 9/11\".\nMoore's film \"Fahrenheit 9/11\", released in 2004, examines America in the aftermath of the September 11 attacks, particularly the record of the George W. Bush Administration and alleged links between the families of George W. Bush and Osama bin Laden. \"Fahrenheit\" was awarded the \"Palme d'Or\", the top honor at the 2004 Cannes Film Festival. It was the first documentary film to win the prize since 1956's \"The Silent World\".\nMoore later announced that \"Fahrenheit 9/11\" would not be in consideration for the 2005 Academy Award for Documentary Feature, but instead for the Academy Award for Best Picture. He stated he wanted the movie to be seen by a few million more people via television broadcasting prior to Election Day. According to Moore, \"Academy rules forbid the airing of a documentary on television within nine months of its theatrical release\", and since the November 2 election was fewer than nine months after the film's release, \"Fahrenheit 9/11\" would have been disqualified for the Documentary Oscar. Regardless, it did not receive an Oscar nomination for Best Picture.\nThe title of the film alludes to the classic book \"Fahrenheit 451\" by Ray Bradbury, about a future totalitarian state in which books are banned, and any books found are burned by firemen. According to the novel, paper begins to burn at . The pre-release subtitle of Moore's film continues the allusion: \"The temperature at which freedom burns.\"\nAs of August 2012, \"Fahrenheit 9/11\" is the highest-grossing documentary of all time, taking in over US$200\u00a0million worldwide, including United States box office revenue of almost US$120\u00a0million. In February 2011, Moore sued producers Bob and Harvey Weinstein for US$2.7\u00a0million in unpaid profits from the film, claiming they used \"Hollywood accounting tricks\" to avoid paying him the money. In February 2012, Moore and the Weinsteins informed the court that they had settled their dispute.\n\"Fahrenheit 9/11\" drew criticism and controversy following its release just prior to the 2004 United States presidential election. Journalist and literary critic Christopher Hitchens alleged that the film contained distortions and untruths. This contention drew multiple rebuttals, including an eFilmCritic article and an editorial in the \"Columbus Free Press\".\n\"Sicko\".\nMoore directed the 2007 film \"Sicko\", about the American health care system, focusing particularly on the managed-care and pharmaceutical industries. At least four major pharmaceutical companies\u2014Pfizer, Eli Lilly, AstraZeneca, and GlaxoSmithKline\u2014ordered their employees not to grant any interviews or assist Moore. According to Moore in a letter on his website, \"roads that often surprise us and lead us to new ideas\u2014and challenge us to reconsider the ones we began with have caused some minor delays.\" The film premiered at the Cannes Film Festival on May 19, 2007, receiving a lengthy standing ovation, and was released in the U.S. and Canada on June 29, 2007. The film is currently ranked the twelfth highest grossing documentary of all time and received an Academy Award nomination for Best Documentary Feature.\n\"Captain Mike Across America\" and \"Slacker Uprising\".\nMoore takes a look at the politics of college students in what he calls \"Bush Administration America\" with \"Captain Mike Across America\", which was shot during Moore's 62-city college campus tour in the months leading up to the 2004 presidential election. The film debuted at the Toronto International Film Festival on September 7, 2007. It was later re-edited by Moore into \"Slacker Uprising\" and released for free on the internet on September 23, 2008.\n\"Capitalism: A Love Story\".\nReleased on September 23, 2009, \"\" analyzes the 2008 financial crisis and the U.S. economy during the transition between the Presidency of George W. Bush and the Presidency of Barack Obama. Addressing a press conference at its release, Moore said, \"Democracy is not a spectator sport, it's a participatory event. If we don't participate in it, it ceases to be a democracy. So Obama will rise or fall based not so much on what he does but on what we do to support him.\"\n\"Where to Invade Next\".\n\"Where to Invade Next\" examines the benefits of progressive social policies in various countries. The film had its premiere at the 2015 Toronto International Film Festival. Godfrey Cheshire, writing for Roger Ebert.com, wrote that \"Moore's surprising and extraordinarily winning \"Where to Invade Next\" will almost surely cast his detractors at Fox News and similar sinkholes into consternation\".\n\"Michael Moore in TrumpLand\".\nIn \"Michael Moore in TrumpLand\", Moore talks about the 2016 Presidential Election Campaigns. It is a solo performance showing Moore on stage speaking to a seated audience. The film consists of Moore's opinions of the candidates and highlights the Democratic National Candidate Hillary Clinton's strengths and also features a lengthy section on how the Republican National Candidate Donald Trump could win. It was filmed in Wilmington, Ohio, at the Murphy Theatre over the course of two nights in October 2016. The film premiered just eleven days after it was shot at the IFC Center in New York City.\n\"Fahrenheit 11/9\".\nIn May 2017, it was announced that Moore had reunited with Harvey Weinstein to direct his new film about Donald Trump, titled \"Fahrenheit 11/9\", which was released in approximately 1,500 theaters in the United States and Canada on September 21, 2018. Sexual assault allegations against Weinstein prompted Moore to revoke the plan to work with The Weinstein Company, which stalled production.\nThe title refers to the day when Donald Trump officially became President-elect of the United States. In a column for \"Variety\" responding to the film's low opening weekend, \"How Michael Moore Lost His Audience,\" sympathetic film critic Owen Gleiberman wrote \"He's like an aging rock star putting out albums that simply don't mean as much to those who were, and are, his core fans\". According to Glenn Greenwald, \"what he's trying is of unparalleled importance, not to take the cheap route of exclusively denouncing Trump, but to take the more complicated, challenging, and productive route of understanding who and what created the climate in which Trump could thrive.\"&lt;ref name=\"Fahrenheit 11/9\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;\n\"Planet of the Humans\".\nMichael Moore was executive producer of the documentary \"Planet of the Humans\", which was directed by Jeff Gibbs and released on July 31, 2019. The film makes the argument that, since the first Earth Day, the condition of the planet has worsened, and questions whether mainstream approaches adopted by industry to mitigate climate change, entail environmental impacts whose costs are comparable to or even possibly outweigh the benefits. The film received criticism from a number of climate change experts and activists who disputed its claims, and the accuracy of figures cited in the film, and suggested that the film could play into the hands of the fossil fuel industry.\nMichael Moore, Jeff Gibbs, and co-producer Ozzie Zehner responded to the critics on an episode of \"Rising\".\n2001\u20132003: Writing.\nMoore has written and co-written eight non-fiction books, mostly on similar subject matter to his documentaries. \"Stupid White Men\" (2001) is ostensibly a critique of American domestic and foreign policy but, by Moore's own admission, is also \"a book of political humor\". \"Dude, Where's My Country?\" (2003), is an examination of the Bush family's relationships with Saudi royalty, the Bin Laden family, and the , and a call-to-action for liberals in the 2004 election. Several of his works have made bestseller lists.\n1999\u20132004: Acting.\nMoore has dabbled in acting, following a supporting role in \"Lucky Numbers\" (2000) playing the cousin of Lisa Kudrow's character, who agrees to be part of the scheme concocted by John Travolta's character. He also had a cameo in his \"Canadian Bacon\" as an anti-Canada activist. In 1999, he did a cameo in \"EDtv\" as one of the panel members. In 2004, he did a cameo, as a news journalist, in \"The Fever\", starring Vanessa Redgrave in the lead.\n1994\u20132017: Television.\nBetween 1994 and 1995, Moore directed and hosted the BBC television series \"TV Nation\", which followed the format of news magazine shows but covered topics they avoid. The series aired on BBC2 in the UK. The series was also aired in the US on NBC in 1994 for 9 episodes and again for 8 episodes on Fox in 1995.\nHis other major series was \"The Awful Truth\", which satirized actions by big corporations and politicians. It aired on the UK's Channel 4, and the Bravo network in the US, in 1999 and 2000. Moore won the Hugh M. Hefner First Amendment Award in Arts and Entertainment for being the executive producer and host of \"The Awful Truth\", where he was also described as \"muckraker, author and documentary filmmaker\".\nAnother 1999 series, \"Michael Moore Live\", was aired in the UK only on Channel 4, though it was broadcast from New York. This show had a similar format to \"The Awful Truth\", but also incorporated phone-ins and a live stunt each week.\nIn 2017, Moore planned to return to prime time network television on Turner/TNT in late 2017 or early 2018 with a program called \"Michael Moore Live from the Apocalypse\". In February 2019, however, the network announced the show would not be produced.\nIn 2003, he guest starred as himself on \"The Simpsons\" episode \"The President Wore Pearls\", stating that children who do not receive music, gym and art are more likely to become unemployed and end up in one of his movies.\n1991\u20132001: Music videos.\nMoore has directed several music videos, including two for Rage Against the Machine for songs from \"The Battle of Los Angeles\": \"Sleep Now in the Fire\" and \"Testify\". He was threatened with arrest during the shooting of \"Sleep Now in the Fire\", which was filmed on Wall Street; and subsequently the city of New York City denied the band permission to play there, even though the band and Moore had secured a federal permit to perform.\nMoore also directed the videos for R.E.M. single \"All the Way to Reno (You're Gonna Be a Star)\" in 2001 and the System of a Down song \"Boom!\".\n2017\u20132018: Theater.\nMoore's Broadway debut, \"The Terms of My Surrender\", an anti-Trump dramatic monologue, premiered on August 10, 2017, at the Belasco Theatre. Donald Trump tweeted his dislike for the show and falsely claimed that it closed early. In the first week the production earned $456,195 in sales and $367,634 in the final week, altogether grossing $4.2\u00a0million, falling short of its potential gross. It lasted 13 weeks with 96 performances until October 2017, grossing 49% of its potential. Fox News gave it a negative review, in line with Trump's comments. The show was unenthusiastically praised by The Guardian, which said he only wanted to \"preach to the choir\". A spokesman for \"The Terms of My Surrender\" suggested that the production might have an engagement in San Francisco in early 2018, which didn't materialize.\nHonorary degree.\nHe was awarded the Honorary Degree of Doctor of Humanities from Michigan State University in Fall 2014.\nPolitical views.\nAlthough Moore has been known for his political activism, he rejects the label as redundant in a democracy: \"I and you and everyone else has to be a political activist. If we're not politically active, it ceases to be a democracy.\" According to John Flesher of the Associated Press, Moore is known for his \"fiery left-wing populism\", and publications such as the \"Socialist Worker Online\" have hailed him as the \"new Tom Paine\". One critic has traced the leftist populism in three of his films (\"Roger &amp; Me\", \"Sicko\", and \"Capitalism: A Love Story\"), arguing that at least these films showcase Moore's populism as embracing specific social causes while also demonstrating an irreverent style that positions Moore as the proverbial little guy \u2018talking truth to power\u2019 against a corporate elite. In a speech, he said that socialism is democracy and Christianity. However, he later said that economic philosophies from the past were not apt enough to describe today's realities.\nMoore was a high-profile guest at both the 2004 Democratic National Convention and the 2004 Republican National Convention, chronicling his impressions in \"USA Today\". He was criticized in a speech by Republican Senator John McCain as \"a disingenuous film-maker\". Moore laughed and waved as Republican attendees jeered, later chanting \"four more years\". Moore gestured an L with his index finger and thumb at the crowd, which translates into \"loser\".\nDuring September and October 2004, Moore spoke at universities and colleges in swing states during his \"Slacker Uprising Tour\". The tour gave away ramen and underwear to students who promised to vote. One stop during the tour was Utah Valley State College. A fight for his right to speak resulted in massive public debates and a media blitz, eventually resulting in a lawsuit against the college and the resignation of at least one member of the college's student government. The Utah event was chronicled in the documentary film \"This Divided State\".\nMoore urged Ralph Nader not to run in 2004 so as not to split the left vote. On \"Real Time with Bill Maher\", Moore and Bill Maher knelt before Nader to plead with him to stay out of the race.\nMoore drew attention in 2004 when he used the term \"deserter\" to describe then president George W. Bush while introducing Retired Army Gen. Wesley K. Clark at a Democratic presidential debate in New Hampshire. Noting that Clark had been a champion debater at West Point, Moore told a laughing crowd, \"I know what you're thinking. I want to see that debate\" between Clark and Bush \u2013 \"the general versus the deserter\". Moore said he was referring to published reports in several media outlets including \"The Boston Globe\" which had reported that \"there is strong evidence that Bush performed no military service as required when he moved from Houston to Alabama to work on a U.S. Senate campaign from May to November 1972.\"\nIn 2007, Moore became a contributing journalist at \"OpEdNews\", and by May 2014, had authored over 70 articles published on their website. Moore was an active supporter of the Occupy Wall Street protest in New York City and spoke with the OWS protesters on September 26, 2011. On October 29, 2011, he spoke at the Occupy Oakland protest site to express his support.\nMoore praised \"Django Unchained\", tweeting that the movie \"is one of the best film satires ever. A rare American movie on slavery and the origins of our sick racist history.\"\nMoore's 2011 claims that \"Four hundred obscenely wealthy individuals, 400 little Mubaraks \u2013 most of whom benefited in some way from the multi-trillion-dollar taxpayer bailout of 2008 \u2013 now have more cash, stock and property than the assets of 155 million Americans combined\" and that these 400 Americans \"have more wealth than half of all Americans combined\" was found to be true by PolitiFact and others.\nAfter Venezuelan President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez died in March 2013, Moore praised him for \"eliminating 75 percent of extreme poverty\" while \"[providing] free health and education for all\".\n2000 presidential election.\nMoore supported Ralph Nader in the 2000 presidential election. Moore was critical of Al Gore and George W. Bush. Moore criticizes Gore for the loss of thousands of jobs during his time as vice president, voting to confirm Antonin Scalia, proposing more funding for the Pentagon, and proposing to expand the war on drugs. Moore reportedly told Bush \"Your possible victory on Tuesday is a threat to our national security\". Moore also called Bush \"a banal, despicable, and corrupt human being\".\nBarack Obama.\nOn April 21, 2008, Moore endorsed Barack Obama for president, stating that Hillary Clinton's recent actions had been \"disgusting\". Moore criticized the 2011 military intervention in Libya. After the US troops launched 110 Tomahawk missiles at military targets in Libya, Moore suggested that President Barack Obama should return his Nobel Peace Prize and tweeted in his official Twitter account, \"May I suggest a 50-mile evacuation zone around Obama's Nobel Peace Prize?\"\nCriticism of Obamacare and support for a single-payer model.\nIn an op-ed piece for \"The New York Times\" published on December 31, 2013, Moore assessed the Affordable Care Act, calling it \"awful\" and adding that \"Obamacare's rocky start ... is a result of one fatal flaw: The Affordable Care Act is a pro-insurance-industry plan implemented by a president who knew in his heart that a single-payer, Medicare-for-all model was the true way to go.\" Despite his strong critique, however, Moore wrote that he still considers the plan a \"godsend\" because it provides a start \"to get what we deserve: universal quality health care.\"\n2016 Presidential election.\nSupport for Bernie Sanders.\nIn December 2015, Moore announced his support for Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders in the 2016 United States presidential election. Moore called Sanders a \"force to contend with\". In January 2016, he officially endorsed Bernie Sanders for president. He also described democratic socialism as \"a true democracy where everyone has a seat at the table, everyone has a voice, not just the rich\". After Sanders lost the 2016 primaries, Moore urged Americans to vote for Clinton while also correctly predicting that Trump would win the election because the post-industrial Midwestern states would vote for Trump. After Trump was elected, Moore called Trump a \"Russian traitor\", saying his presidency had \"no legitimacy\".\nOther developments.\nIn October 2016, Moore criticized Julian Assange and WikiLeaks for publishing leaks from the DNC's emails, saying: \"I think WikiLeaks and I think Assange, they're essentially anarchists and they know, just like a lot of people voting for Trump know, that he's their human Molotov cocktail and they want to blow up the system. It's an anarchic move.\"\nIn November 2016, right after Donald Trump was elected President of the United States, and inspired by Bertram Gross's 1980 book, \"Friendly Fascism\", Moore reportedly stated: \"The next wave of fascists will not come with cattle cars and concentration camps, but they'll come with a smiley face and maybe a TV show ... That's how the 21st-century fascists will essentially take over.\"\nDonald Trump.\nTrumpileaks.\nMoore started the website TrumpiLeaks in May 2017, to encourage whistleblowers to provide information about Donald Trump. Moore was inspired to create the site after witnessing the firings by Trump of three law enforcement officials, specifically: United States Attorney Preet Bharara, former acting United States Attorney General Sally Yates, and former Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation James Comey. Moore posted a message to his personal website, explaining the motivation of the new venture and that he wanted any information related to: \"crimes, breaches of public trust and misconduct committed by Donald J. Trump and his associates\". He asserted, \"Trump thinks he's above the law\". Moore stated it was his view that Trump had engaged in obstruction of justice, falsehoods to the United States citizenry, promoted violent behavior, and violated the Constitution of the United States.\nCriticism of corporate media.\nIn March 2018, Moore criticized the \"corporate media\", saying \"You turn on the TV, and it's 'Russia, Russia, Russia!' These are all shiny keys to distract us. We should know about the West Virginia strike. What an inspiration that would be. But they don't show this\".\nCalls for Trump's impeachment.\nIn April 2018, Moore taunted Trump by ironically asking him why he had not already fired Robert Mueller. After the Russia\u2013United States summit of July 2018, Moore called for Trump's impeachment, saying \"Congress needs no more proof than Trump's admission yesterday that he sides with Putin to impeach and remove him.\"\nMoore compared Trump to Nazi Germany's dictator Adolf Hitler. On August 10, 2019, Moore tweeted: \"I guess they think a country dumb enough to elect Trump is stupid enough to believe Jeffrey Epstein committed suicide.\"\nFurther support for Bernie Sanders.\nIn October 2019, he announced his political endorsement of Bernie Sanders in the 2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries. After Sanders lost the primaries, Moore urged Sanders supporters to vote for Joe Biden in the general election.\nPersonal life.\nMoore met Kathleen Glynn&lt;ref name=\"mlive/2014/07/moore_divorce_final\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; at the \"Flint Voice\", and they married on October 19, 1991.&lt;ref name=\"usatoday/77340806\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; He filed for divorce on June 17, 2013. On July 22, 2014, the divorce was finalized.\nMoore is Catholic, but has differed with some of the traditional church teaching on subjects such as abortion and same-sex marriage. In an interview with \"The A.V. Club\", when asked if there was a God, he stated, \"Yes, there is. I don't know how you define that, but yeah.\"\nFollowing the Columbine High School massacre, Moore acquired a lifetime membership to the National Rifle Association of America (NRA). Moore said that he initially intended to become the NRA's president to dismantle the organization, but he soon dismissed the plan as too difficult. Gun rights supporters such as Dave Kopel said there was no chance of that happening; David T. Hardy and Jason Clarke wrote that Moore failed to discover that the NRA selects a president not by membership vote but by a vote of the board of directors.\nIn 2005, \"Time\" named Moore one of the world's 100 most influential people. Later in 2005, Moore founded the Traverse City Film Festival held annually in Traverse City, Michigan. In 2009, he co-founded the Traverse City Comedy Festival, also held annually in Traverse City, where Moore helped to spearhead the renovation of the historic downtown State Theater.\nCriticism.\nChristopher Hitchens, a supporter of the Iraq War, described the film \"Fahrenheit 9/11\" as \"utterly propagandistic\". In an article titled \"The lies of Michael Moore\" Hitchens rebuked Moore and his film for its contradictions and promotion of falsehoods. He also criticized Moore for his belief that Osama bin Laden should be considered innocent until proven guilty despite having taken credit for the September 11 attacks. Former Democratic mayor of New York City Ed Koch, who had endorsed Bush for re-election, wrote an op-ed in which he described Moore's film as propaganda. Koch further maintained that \"Fahrenheit 9/11\" was replete with \"blatant lies\".\nIn 2003, \"The Wall Street Journal\" said that \"Bowling for Columbine\" was \"filled with so many inaccuracies and distortions that it ought to be classed as a work of fiction.\" The \"Boston Review\" said the film contained \"deliberate falsehoods\", highlighting an interview in which Moore selectively edited and rearranged an interview with NRA president Charlton Heston to \"create the stupid, callous white guy he attacks.\"\nIn 2009, Moore faced criticism for using non-union workers to produce his film \"Capitalism: A Love Story\". After his 2014 divorce, Moore was reported to have nine homes and a net worth of $50\u00a0million. Aaron Foley, writing in \"Jalopnik\", accused Moore of hypocrisy due to his anti-capitalist views.\nIn a review of \"Fahrenheit 11/9\", a film critiquing Donald Trump, John Anderson wrote \"Almost the entire movie is lifted from other sources, and then edited in a way that makes his enemies (do they know they're his enemies?) look as foolish as possible. ... Mr. Moore can't help himself, he uses footage of Adolf Hitler lip-syncing a Trump speech. Much has been made of Mr. Trump's questionable maturity. He has a kindred spirit in Michael Moore\".\nConservative author Douglas Murray criticized Moore for stating that \"Every problem in the world, look at it and behind it you've got white men\". In response to his comments Murray said, \"Michael Moore is one of those who doesn't realize that other people have agency and can muck up the world and their own countries in their own ways, and he's obviously never heard of numerous countries, including North Korea\".\nAfter the killing of Brian Thompson, former CEO of UnitedHealth Group, \"Reason\" wrote:Eliding the question of whether it's appropriate to murder an apparently random executive as a synecdoche of the entire health insurance industry, Moore merely says the anger felt by Mangione and others is \"1000% justified\" and \"I'm not going to tamp it down or ask people to shut up. I want to pour gasoline on that anger.\" The alleged shooter of Thompson was found to have had in his possession at the time of being captured by law enforcement, a document in which the shooter cited two people, Moore and Elisabeth Rosenthal, as those who had \"illuminated the corruption and greed\" of the healthcare/health insurance industry.\nIn January 2025, Michael Moore's endorsement of the Palestinian anthology film \"From Ground Zero\" drew swift criticism from Christians United for Israel (CUFI), which accused the film of \"populist propaganda\" in an email campaign aimed at Academy voters and exhibitors and urged its removal from awards and theaters.\nMoore dismissed CUFI's charge that the film downplays Hamas's October 7 attacks\u2014insisting instead that \"the shadow of October 7 hangs over the whole film\" while blaming the Israeli government's policies for the suffering of civilians in the Gaza. His comments\u2014and his warning about self-censorship in U.S. film distribution\u2014sparked debate over the role of documentary filmmakers in political conflicts, earning both praise for his moral courage and criticism for perceived one-sidedness.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

This can be a regional or local government subdivision in various countries, or a subdivision in certain international church structures. During the antiquity, it was the name of a type of Roman district. In the 21st century, the term prefecture is used for the modern first-level subdivisions of the Central African Republic, Japan, and Morocco.\nLiteral prefectures.\nAntiquity.\n\"Prefecture\" originally referred to several distinct administrative structures in ancient Rome.\nIn the Roman Republic and early Empire, a praefectura was a town or community lacking full civic autonomy and administered by a Roman-appointed Praefectus. These praefecturae were common in Italy before the extension of Roman citizenship and typically occupied a lower legal status than a municipium or colonia.\nLater, during the Tetrarchy, Emperor Diocletian reorganized the Roman Empire into four major administrative divisions known as praetorian prefectures. Each was composed of several dioceses and governed by a senior official called a \"Praetorian prefect\". This structure persisted into the Byzantine Empire and influenced later forms of territorial governance.\nEcclesiastic.\nAs Catholic canon law is strongly inspired by Roman law, it is not surprising that the Catholic Church has several offices under a prefect. That term occurs also in otherwise styled offices, such as the head of a congregation or department of the Roman Curia. Various ecclesiastical areas, too small for a diocese, are termed prefects.\nAnalogous prefectures.\nBrazilian equivalent of \"prefecture\".\nIn Brazil, the prefecture ( or in Portuguese) is the executive branch of the government of each Brazilian municipality ( in Portuguese). The term also refers to the office of the mayor ( in Portuguese).\nCentral African Republic.\nThe Central African Republic is divided into twenty prefectures.\nGreek equivalent of \"prefecture\".\nFrom 1836 until 2011, modern Greece was divided into (, singular , ) which formed the country's main administrative units. These are most commonly translated into English as \"prefectures\" or \"counties\".\nEach was headed by a prefect (, ), who was a ministerial appointee until ca. 1990, but was then elected by direct popular vote in a process of decentralization that saw the prefectures become local government units. Municipal elections in Greece are held every four years and voting for the election of prefects and mayors was carried out concurrently but with separate ballots.\nThe 2010 Kallikratis plan, which took effect on 1 January 2011, abolished the prefectures as separate administrative units, and transformed them into regional units within the country's thirteen administrative regions.\nChinese equivalents of \"prefecture\".\nThe ancient sense.\nWhen used in the context of Chinese history, especially China before the Tang dynasty, the word \"prefecture\" is used to translate \"xian\" (). This unit of administration is translated as \"county\" when used in a contemporary context, because of the increase of the number of \"xian\" and the decrease of their sizes over time in the Chinese history.\nIn the context of Chinese history during or after the Tang dynasty, the word \"prefecture\" is used to translate \"zhou\" (Wade\u2013Giles \"chou\" (), another ancient unit of administration in China, equivalent to the modern \"province\".\nThe modern sense.\nIn modern-day China, the prefecture (; pinyin: ) is an administrative division found in the second level of the administrative hierarchy. In addition to prefectures, this level also includes autonomous prefectures, leagues, and prefecture-level cities. The prefecture level comes under the province level, and in turn oversees the county level.\nItalian \"prefettura\".\nIn Italy a \"prefettura\" is the office of a \"prefetto\", the representative of the Government in each province.\nFrench \"pr\u00e9fecture\".\nIn France, a \"pr\u00e9fecture\" is the capital city of a department, and by metonymy also designates the office and residence of the prefect. As there are 101 departments in France, there are 101 prefectures. A \"pr\u00e9fecture de r\u00e9gion\" is the capital city of an administrative region. This is the city where the prefect \u2013 the appointed government representative \u2013 resides.\nJapanese sense of \"prefecture\".\nIn English, \"prefecture\" is used as the translation for , which are the main subdivisions of Japan. They consist of 43 prefectures (\u770c \"ken\") proper, two urban prefectures (\u5e9c \"fu\", Osaka and Kyoto), one \"circuit\" or \"territory\" (\u9053 \"d\u014d\", Hokkaido) and one \"metropolis\" (\u90fd \"to\", Tokyo). Before the end of World War II, the word was also used for overseas areas \u5e81 (\"ch\u014d\")\u3001\u5dde (\"sh\u016b\") and \u9053 (\"d\u014d\", in Korea).\nKorean equivalents of \"prefecture\".\nUntil 1894 (Korean:\u00a0; Hanja:\u00a0) was the lowest level administrative division in Korea and can be translated into \"Petty Prefecture\" in the modern sense. It was below (, ; \"county\") in the administrative hierarchy.\n (; ) was a higher level administrative division and can be translated into \"Protectorate General\", \"Greater Prefecture\", \"Metropolitan Prefecture\", or \"Martial Prefecture\" in the modern sense. The capital, Hanyang (Seoul), can sometimes be translated as \"Hanseong Prefecture\".\nIn 1895, and divisions were abolished. From 1910 to 1949, the term \"prefecture\" was used to translate (; ). Since 1949 neither nor have been used, and there has been no division in either the South Korean or North Korean administrative system which translates as \"prefecture\".\nMongolian equivalent.\nMongolian prefectures (Aimags) were adopted during Qing dynasty's rule. Today these are usually translated as \"provinces\".\nMoroccan \"Pr\u00e9fecture\".\nIn Morocco, the 75 second-level administrative subdivisions are 13 prefectures and 62 provinces. They are subdivisions of the 12 regions of Morocco. Each prefecture and province are subdivided in their turn into districts (\"cercles\", sing. \"cercle\"), municipalities (\"communes\", sing. \"commune\") or urban municipalities (\"communes urbaines\", sing. \"commune urbaine\"), and \"arrondissements\" in some metropolitan areas.\nSwiss \"pr\u00e9fecture\".\nIn Switzerland, \"pr\u00e9fecture\" dates back to the Helvetic Republic and were inspired by France. As of 2025, five cantons still have \"pr\u00e9fectures\", including Berne, Fribourg, Valais, Vaud. The \"pr\u00e9fecture\" is a local representative of the regional government.\nVenezuelan equivalent.\nTraditionally, the term prefecture referred to a City Hall and the prefect was the equivalent of a mayor and commissioner. After recent changes, the prefectures and prefects are analogous with the figure of Town Clerk.\nQuebec Equivalent\nIn the province of Quebec, a prefect (pr\u00e9fet in French) is the head of a Regional County Municipality (RCM / MRC). The method of selecting the prefect varies: in some RCMs, the prefect is elected by the mayors of the municipalities within the RCM, while in others, the prefect is elected directly by all voters during municipal elections. The prefect coordinates regional planning, infrastructure, and shared municipal services, while municipalities retain authority over local matters. The prefect also serves as a liaison between the RCM and the provincial government.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The officeholder has authority upon the other prefects in the region on a range of matters.\nRole of the prefecture.\nThere are 101 prefectures in France, one for each department. The official in charge is the prefect (). The prefecture is an administration that belongs to the Ministry of the Interior; it is therefore in charge of the delivery of identity cards, driving licenses, passports, residency and work permits for foreigners, vehicle registration, registration of associations (creation, status modification, dissolution), as well as of the management of the National Police and firefighters, although as of 2018, 79% of firefighters in France are part-time volunteers.\nPrefectures are usually located near the geographic centre of their departments; they were originally chosen for being within a day's travel on horseback from anywhere in the department. Therefore, the largest settlement in a department may not always be its prefecture: the department of Marne, for example, has its prefecture at Ch\u00e2lons-en-Champagne despite the city of Reims, near the Aisne border, being four times its size.\nThe prefect represents the national government at the local level and as such exercises the powers that are constitutionally attributed to the national government. The prefect issues ordinances written for the application of local law: to close a building that does not conform to safety codes, or modify vehicular traffic regulations (speed limit, construction permits).\nThe governing body of the department is the departmental council (), which is elected through a system of cantons. It is in charge of the building and maintenance of middle schools (\"coll\u00e8ges\") and departmental roads, financial assistance to dependent people (disabled and elderly), as well as promotion of local economic development, amongst other matters. In the past, the prefect was head of the department, but since 1982, the President of the Departmental Council has assumed the role of chief executive of the department.\nParisian exception.\nThere is an exception in Paris in the \u00cele-de-France region and its three surrounding departments, known as the Petite Couronne (\"Small Crown\"): Hauts-de-Seine to the west, Seine-Saint-Denis to the northeast and Val-de-Marne to the southeast. These departments are administered by an additional separate unitary prefecture for law enforcement and security purposes, a Prefecture of Police (), known as the Paris Police Prefecture, a situation inherited from the Paris Commune of 1871. The power of law enforcement is usually vested in the mayor in other communes. This power is held by the Prefect of Police of Paris in the Petite Couronne.\nIn 2012, a similar structure was established in Bouches-du-Rh\u00f4ne, the Bouches-du-Rh\u00f4ne Police Prefecture, headed by the Prefect of Police of Bouches-du-Rh\u00f4ne, although it is formally less independent than that of Paris.\nDivisions of departments.\nDepartments are divided into arrondissements, themselves divided into cantons. The \"chef-lieu d'arrondissement\" is the subprefecture (). The official in charge is the subprefect (). There are relatively few competences associated to cantons, the most important one being the local organisation of elections, as cantons are electoral subdivisions.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

They include 43 prefectures proper (, \"ken\"), two urban prefectures (, \"fu\": Osaka and Kyoto), one regional prefecture (, \"d\u014d\": Hokkaid\u014d) and one metropolis (, \"to\": Tokyo). \nIn 1868, the Meiji \"Fuhanken sanchisei\" administration created the first prefectures (urban \"fu\" and rural \"ken\") to replace the urban and rural administrators (\"bugy\u014d\", \"daikan\", etc.) in the parts of the country previously controlled directly by the shogunate and a few territories of rebels/shogunate loyalists who had not submitted to the new government such as Aizu/Wakamatsu. In 1871, all remaining feudal domains \"(han)\" were also transformed into prefectures, so that prefectures subdivided the whole country. In several waves of territorial consolidation, today's 47 prefectures were formed by the turn of the century. In many instances, these are contiguous with the ancient ritsury\u014d provinces of Japan.\nEach prefecture's chief executive is a directly elected . Ordinances and budgets are enacted by a unicameral whose members are elected for four-year terms.\nUnder a set of 1888\u20131890 laws on local government until the 1920s, each prefecture (then only 3 \"-fu\" and 42 \"-ken\"; \"Hokkaid\u014d\" and \"Okinawa-ken\" were subject to different laws until the 20th century) was subdivided into and and each district into and . Hokkaid\u014d has 14 subprefectures that act as and of the prefecture. Some other prefectures also have branch offices that carry out prefectural administrative functions outside the capital. Tokyo, the capital of Japan, is a merged city-prefecture; a metropolis, it has features of both cities and prefectures.\nEach prefecture has its own mon for identification, the equivalent of a coat of arms in the West.\nBackground.\nThe West's use of \"prefecture\" to label these Japanese regions stems from 16th-century Portuguese explorers and traders use of \"prefeitura\" to describe the fiefdoms they encountered there. Its original sense in Portuguese, however, was closer to \"municipality\" than \"province\". Today, in turn, Japan uses its word \"ken\" (), meaning \"prefecture\", to identify Portuguese districts while in Brazil the word \"Prefeitura\" is used to refer to a city hall.\nThose fiefs were headed by a local warlord or family. Though the fiefs have long since been dismantled, merged, and reorganized multiple times, and been granted legislative governance and oversight, the rough translation stuck.\nThe Meiji government established the current system in July 1871 with the abolition of the han system and establishment of the . Although there were initially over 300 prefectures, many of them being former han territories, this number was reduced to 72 in the latter part of 1871, and 47 in 1888. The Local Autonomy Law of 1947 gave more political power to prefectures, and installed prefectural governors and parliaments.\nIn 2003, Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi proposed that the government consolidates the current prefectures into about 10 regional states (so-called \"d\u014dsh\u016bsei\"). The plan called for each region to have greater autonomy than existing prefectures. This process would reduce the number of subprefecture administrative regions and cut administrative costs. The Japanese government also considered a plan to merge several groups of prefectures, creating a subnational administrative division system consisting of between nine and 13 states, and giving these states more local autonomy than the prefectures currently enjoy. As of August 2012, this plan was abandoned.\nPowers.\nJapan is a unitary state. The central government delegates many functions (such as education and the police force) to the prefectures and municipalities, but retains the overall right to control them. Although local government expenditure accounts for 70 percent of overall government expenditure, the central government controls local budgets, tax rates, and borrowing.\nPrefectural government functions include the organization of the prefectural police force, the supervision of schools and the maintenance of prefectural schools (mainly high schools), prefectural hospitals, prefectural roads, the supervision of prefectural waterways and regional urban planning. Their responsibilities include tasks delegated to them by the national government such as maintaining most ordinary national roads (except in designated major cities), and prefectures coordinate and support their municipalities in their functions. De facto, prefectures as well as municipalities have often been less autonomous than the formal extent of the local autonomy law suggests, because of national funding and policies. Most of municipalities depend heavily on central government funding \u2013 a dependency recently further exacerbated in many regions by the declining population which hits rural areas harder and earlier (cities can offset it partly through migration from the countryside). In many policy areas, the basic framework is set tightly by national laws, and prefectures and municipalities are only autonomous within that framework.\nTypes of prefecture.\nHistorically, during the Edo period, the Tokugawa shogunate established around the nine largest cities in Japan, and 302 elsewhere. When the Meiji government began to create the prefectural system in 1868, the nine bugy\u014d-ruled zones became , while the township-ruled zones and the rest of the bugy\u014d-ruled zones became . Later, in 1871, the government designated Tokyo, Osaka, and Kyoto as \"fu\", and relegated the other \"fu\" to the status of \"ken.\" During World War II, in 1943, Tokyo became a \"to,\" a new type of pseudo-prefecture.\nDespite the differences in terminology, there is little functional difference between the four types of local governments. The subnational governments are sometimes collectively referred to as in Japanese, which is a combination of the four terms.\n\"To\".\nTokyo, capital city of Japan is referred to as , which is often translated as \"metropolis\". The Japanese government translates as \"Tokyo Metropolis\" in almost all cases, and the government is officially called the \"Tokyo Metropolitan Government\".\nFollowing the capitulation of the Tokugawa shogunate in 1868, \"T\u014dky\u014d-fu\" (an urban prefecture like Kyoto and Osaka) was set up and encompassed the former city area of Edo under the Fuhanken sanchisei. After the abolition of the han system in the first wave of prefectural mergers in 1871/72, several surrounding areas (parts of Urawa, Kosuge, Shinagawa and Hikone prefectures) were merged into Tokyo, and under the system of (numbered) \"large districts and small districts\" \"(daiku-sh\u014dku)\", it was subdivided into eleven large districts further subdivided into 103 small districts, six of the large districts (97 small districts) covered the former city area of Edo. When the ancient ritsury\u014d districts were reactivated as administrative units in 1878, Tokyo was subdivided into 15 [urban] districts \"(-ku)\" and initially six [rural] districts (\"-gun\"; nine after the Tama transfer from Kanagawa in 1893, eight after the merger of East Tama and South Toshima into Toyotama in 1896). Both urban and rural districts, like everywhere in the country, were further subdivided into urban units/towns/neighbourhoods \"(-ch\u014d/-machi)\" and rural units/villages \"(-mura/-son)\". The yet unincorporated communities on the Izu (previously part of Shizuoka) and Ogasawara (previously directly Home Ministry-administrated) island groups became also part of Tokyo in the 19th century. When the modern municipalities \u2013 [district-independent] cities and [rural] districts containing towns and villages \u2013 were introduced under the Yamagata-Mosse laws on local government and the simultaneous Great Meiji merger was performed in 1889, the 15 \"-ku\" became wards of Tokyo City, initially Tokyo's only independent city \"(-shi)\", the six rural districts of Tokyo were consolidated in 85 towns and villages. In 1893, the three Tama districts and their 91 towns and villages became part of Tokyo. As Tokyo city's suburbs grew rapidly in the early 20th century, many towns and villages in Tokyo were merged or promoted over the years. In 1932, five complete districts with their 82 towns and villages were merged into Tokyo City and organised in 20 new wards. Also, by 1940, there were two more cities in Tokyo: Hachi\u014dji City and Tachikawa City.\nIn 1943, Tokyo City was abolished, \"T\u014dky\u014d-fu\" became \"T\u014dky\u014d-to\", and Tokyo-shi's 35 wards remained Tokyo-to's 35 wards, but submunicipal authorities of Tokyo-shi's wards which previously fell directly under the municipality, with the municipality now abolished, fell directly under prefectural or now \"Metropolitan\" authority. All other cities, towns and villages in Tokyo-fu stayed cities, towns and villages in Tokyo-to. The reorganisation's aim was to consolidate the administration of the area around the capital by eliminating the extra level of authority in Tokyo. Also, the governor was no longer called \"chiji\", but \"ch\u014dkan\" (~\"head/chief [usually: of a central government agency]\") as in Hokkaid\u014d). The central government wanted to have greater control over all local governments due to Japan's deteriorating position in World War II \u2013 for example, all mayors in the country became appointive as in the Meiji era \u2013 and over Tokyo in particular, due to the possibility of emergency in the metropolis.\nAfter the war, Japan was forced to decentralise Tokyo again, following the general terms of democratisation outlined in the Potsdam Declaration. Many of Tokyo's special governmental characteristics disappeared during this time, and the wards took on an increasingly municipal status in the decades following the surrender. Administratively, today's special wards are almost indistinguishable from other municipalities.\nThe postwar reforms also changed the map of Tokyo significantly: In 1947, the 35 wards were reorganised into the 23 special wards, because many of its citizens had either died during the war, left the city, or been drafted and did not return. In the occupation reforms, special wards, each with their own elected assemblies (\"kugikai\") and mayors (\"kuch\u014d\"), were intended to be equal to other municipalities even if some restrictions still applied. (For example, there was during the occupation a dedicated municipal police agency for the 23 special wards/former Tokyo City, yet the special wards public safety commission was not named by the special ward governments, but by the government of the whole \"Metropolis\". In 1954, independent municipal police forces were abolished generally in the whole country, and the prefectural/\"Metropolitan\" police of Tokyo is again responsible for the whole prefecture/\"Metropolis\" and like all prefectural police forces controlled by the prefectural/\"Metropolitan\" public safety commission whose members are appointed by the prefectural/\"Metropolitan\" governor and assembly.) But, as part of the \"reverse course\" of the 1950s some of these new rights were removed, the most obvious measure being the denial of directly elected mayors. Some of these restrictions were removed again over the decades. But it was not until the year 2000 that the special wards were fully recognised as municipal-level entities.\nIndependently from these steps, as Tokyo's urban growth again took up pace during the postwar economic miracle and most of the main island part of Tokyo \"Metropolis\" became increasingly core part of the Tokyo metropolitan area, many of the other municipalities in Tokyo have transferred some of their authority to the Metropolitan government. For example, the Tokyo Fire Department which was only responsible for the 23 special wards until 1960 has until today taken over the municipal fire departments in almost all of Tokyo. A joint governmental structure for the whole Tokyo metropolitan area (and not only the western suburbs of the special wards which are part of the Tokyo prefecture/Metropolis\") as advocated by some politicians such as former Kanagawa governor Shigefumi Matsuzawa has not been established (see also D\u014dsh\u016bsei). Existing cross-prefectural fora of cooperation between local governments in the Tokyo metropolitan area are the Kant\u014d regional governors' association \"(Kant\u014d chih\u014d chijikai)\" and the \"Shutoken summit\" (formally \"conference of chief executives of nine prefectures and cities\", \"9 to-ken-shi shun\u014d kaigi\"). But, these are not themselves local public entities under the local autonomy law and national or local government functions cannot be directly transferred to them, unlike the \"Union of Kansai governments\" \"(Kansai k\u014diki-reng\u014d)\" which has been established by several prefectural governments in the Kansai region.\nThere are some differences in terminology between Tokyo and other prefectures: police and fire departments are called instead of , for instance. But the only functional difference between T\u014dky\u014d-to and other prefectures is that Tokyo administers wards as well as cities. Today, since the special wards have almost the same degree of independence as Japanese cities, the difference in administration between Tokyo and other prefectures is fairly minor.\nIn Osaka, several prominent politicians led by T\u014dru Hashimoto, then mayor of Osaka City and former governor of Osaka Prefecture, proposed an Osaka Metropolis plan, under which Osaka City, and possibly other neighboring cities, would be replaced by special wards similar to Tokyo's. The plan was narrowly defeated in a 2015 referendum, and again in 2020.\n\"D\u014d\".\nHokkaid\u014d is referred to as a or circuit. This term was originally used to refer to Japanese regions consisting of several provinces (e.g. the T\u014dkaid\u014d east-coast region, and Saikaido west-coast region). This was also a historical usage of the character in China. (In Korea, this historical usage is still used today and was kept during the period of Japanese rule.)\n, the only remaining \"d\u014d\" today, was not one of the original seven \"d\u014d\" (it was known as Ezo in the pre-modern era). Its current name is believed to originate from Matsuura Takeshiro, an early Japanese explorer of the island. Since Hokkaid\u014d did not fit into the existing \"d\u014d\" classifications, a new \"d\u014d\" was created to cover it.\nThe Meiji government originally classified Hokkaid\u014d as a , and later divided the island into three prefectures (Sapporo, Hakodate, and Nemuro). These were consolidated into a single in 1886, at prefectural level but organized more along the lines of a territory. In 1947, the department was dissolved, and Hokkaid\u014d became a full-fledged prefecture. The \"-ken\" suffix was never added to its name, so the \"-d\u014d\" suffix came to be understood to mean \"prefecture\".\nWhen Hokkaid\u014d was incorporated, transportation on the island was still underdeveloped, so the prefecture was split into several that could fulfill administrative duties of the prefectural government and keep tight control over the developing island. These subprefectures still exist today, although they have much less power than they possessed before and during World War II. They now exist primarily to handle paperwork and other bureaucratic functions.\n\"Hokkaid\u014d Prefecture\" is, technically speaking, a redundant term because \"d\u014d\" itself indicates a prefecture, although it is occasionally used to differentiate the government from the island itself. The prefecture's government calls itself the \"Hokkaid\u014d Government\" rather than the \"Hokkaid\u014d Prefectural Government\".\n\"Fu\".\nOsaka and Kyoto Prefectures are referred to as . The Classical Chinese character from which this is derived implies a core urban zone of national importance. Before World War II, different laws applied to \"fu\" and \"ken,\" but this distinction was abolished after the war, and the two types of prefecture are now functionally the same.\n\"Ken\".\n43 of the 47 prefectures are referred to as . The Classical Chinese character from which this is derived carries a rural or provincial connotation, and an analogous character is used to refer to the counties of China, counties of Taiwan and districts of Vietnam.\nLists of prefectures.\nThe different systems of frame the ways in which Japanese prefectures are perceived:\nBy Japanese ISO.\nThe prefectures are traditionally grouped into eight regions (\u5730\u65b9, \"chih\u014d\"). Those regions are not formally specified, they do not have elected officials, nor are they corporate bodies. This ordering is mirrored in Japan's International Organization for Standardization (ISO) coding. From north to south (numbering in order), the prefectures of Japan and their commonly associated regions are:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\n\"The default alphabetic order in this sortable table can be altered to mirror the traditional Japanese regions and ISO parsing.\"\nFormer prefectures.\nLost after World War II.\nHere are some territories that were lost after World War II. This does not include all the territories of the Empire of Japan such as Manchukuo.\nAnnotations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The show focuses on Mickey Mouse and his friends running a cartoon theater dinner club in the fictional setting of ToonTown, catering to many characters from Disney cartoons and animated movies while showcasing a variety of their cartoon shorts. The series is named after a common nickname or epithet for the Walt Disney Company.\nThe animated series is a spin off of the series \"Mickey Mouse Works\", and featured many of the series' shorts as well as selection of brand new shorts, and classic Mickey Mouse, Goofy and Donald Duck shorts from the 1930s\u201350s.\nDuring its time, the animated series held two nominations for awards, while select cast members won two awards for their performances as characters in \"House of Mouse\". The series featured two direct-to-video films \u2013 \"\" and \"Mickey's House of Villains\" \u2013 along with an all-night marathon of the \"House of Mouse\", aired on Toon Disney in September 2002 under the title \"Night of 1,000 Toons\".\nPremise.\nThe basic premise of the show focuses on Mickey Mouse and his friends operating a dinner theater club in downtown ToonTown. Considered a popular venue by the residents, the club is frequented by a host of characters from Disney animated properties; a feature of the series is that every film produced by Walt Disney Feature Animation prior to the start of the series (between and including \"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\" and \"\", with the exception of the CGI \"Dinosaur\") are featured in the series. Such characters mostly appear as paying guests of the club, and would often have speaking roles, although a number sometimes operate as performers for the club. The series also includes many relatively obscure and otherwise rarely used Disney characters, often with speaking parts for the first time \u2013 for example, Li'l Bad Wolf and April, May and June, who had appeared very often in Disney comic books but never before in an animated cartoon, made their animated debuts on \"House of Mouse\". The show also featured some cameos by characters created for other television cartoons such as \"Pepper Ann\" and theme park attractions like The Haunted Mansion, but these appearances were few and far between.\nEach episode focuses on a story involving Mickey and his associates facing an issue during an evening's operation of the club, and their efforts to overcome it \u2013 the most common plot for episodes involves the group dealing with a serious problem caused by Pete in his attempts to shut down the club and use it for his own gains. These stories, often involving farcical mishaps, tended to act as a wraparound for the cartoon shorts played in between scenes, the theme of the story contributing towards the story-lines of the cartoon shorts shown in the episode. Cartoon shorts played in episodes focused on elements from classic theatrical cartoons of the 1930s, 1940s and 1950s, though most were reruns from \"Mickey Mouse Works\", and featured a simple story.\nProduction.\nThen vice president of Disney Television Animation at the time, Barry Blumberg, wanted to produce a series that worked as a better format for \"Mickey Mouse Works\". Bobs Gannaway and Tony Craig aimed to have the series reintroduce Disney characters to a new generation who were only familiar with them via marketing and \"homogenized theme-park figures\". They wanted to avoid making Mickey Mouse \"hip\" or \"edgy\" and retain the characters' personalities as closely as possible. The series was notable in that it allowed the characters to be played with more loosely as Craig stated, \"Everybody thought it was really funny to loosen up a bit and let the characters be who they were and have some fun, instead of being so stiff\". The crew was not allowed to use any of the characters from \"Tarzan\" due to licensing issues. Gannaway and Craig also deliberately tried to avoid using characters from \"The Hunchback of Notre Dame\" due to them being \"inherently dramatic\", nevertheless, Tantor, Quasimodo and a few other characters from \"The Hunchback of Notre Dame\" would make a couple of cameos in the series. There were other limits for this program as well, which forbids the use of Pixar characters due to Disney not owning content from Pixar prior to 2006 and King Louie following a legal dispute. This even omits characters created for the direct-to-video sequels due to the show\u2019s primarily focus on characters that are of Disney canon with a few exceptions.\nThe show was produced by Walt Disney Television, and originally aired from 2001 to 2003, running for 52 episodes. The show is one of many Disney cartoon series made in the widescreen HD format. Like with \"Mickey Mouse Works\", the animation was outsourced to Toon City in the Philippines. Unlike that series, it was also outsourced to Walt Disney Animation Australia and Walt Disney Animation Japan.\nThe theme song is performed by Brian Setzer.\nBroadcast.\n\"House of Mouse\" aired on One Saturday Morning on ABC. It reran from September 9, 2002 to February 4, 2006 on Disney Channel. The show ceased broadcast on U.S. television on February 6, 2009, after being aired for the last time on Toon Disney before becoming Disney XD.\nReception.\nCritical response.\nNoah Bell of \"Collider\" stated, \"For Disney fans growing up in the 2000s, \"House of Mouse\" was like a dream brought to life. Taking place primarily in a dinner club owned by Mickey, the show featured characters from virtually every Disney film made at that point interacting on a scale never seen before or since. With people's love of crossovers only growing since the series ended, an updated \"House of Mouse\" could have a lot going for it.\" Gabriel Stanford-Reisinger of \"FanSided\" asserted, \"While it didn't last as long as others, it proved to be a fan-favorite.\"\nRafael Sarmiento of \"Screen Rant\" ranked \"House of Mouse\" fourteenth in their \"15 Best Kid's Cartoons Of The 2000s\" list, writing, \"\"House of Mouse\" is among the best cartoons of the 2000s for exemplifying just how fun the era was for Disney cartoons.\" Max Spirenkov of \"Looper\" ranked \"House of Mouse\" twentieth in their \"50 Best Kids Shows Of The 2000s\" list, saying, \"Longtime fans of Disney films will absolutely adore this series, as Mickey winds up being the host to just about every character you could ask for throughout Disney cinema history. If hosting one of the biggest crossovers in television wasn't enough, the comical nature of the show provides a new angle to many iconic characters from older films, especially in its portrayal of some of the most notable villains over the years.\"\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

His contribution to Mickey Mouse comics is comparable to Carl Barks's on the Donald Duck comics. 17 years after his death, his memory was honored with the Disney Legends award in 2003 and induction into the Comic Book Hall of Fame in 2006.\nBiography.\nEarly life and career.\nGottfredson was born into a large family in Kaysville, Utah, in 1905, and raised in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. As a child, Floyd severely injured his arm in a hunting accident. Housebound during a long recovery, he became interested in cartooning and took several cartooning correspondence courses. Because of his injury, Gottfredson had to draw using his whole arm. In 1926, he took the Federal Schools of Illustrating and Cartooning's correspondence course, and by the late 1920s, he was drawing cartoons for trade magazines and the \"Salt Lake City Telegram\" newspaper.\nAfter achieving second place in a 1928 cartoon contest, the 23-year-old Gottfredson moved to Southern California with his wife and family, just before Christmas. At the time, there were seven major newspapers in the area, but he was unable to find work with any. One job he had held in Utah, however, was as a movie projectionist and he found employment in that field in California. A year later, the movie theater where he had been working was torn down, resulting in another job search. On a whim, Gottfredson inquired at Disney studios, which hired him the same day.\nMickey Mouse.\nWalt Disney Productions hired Gottfredson as an apprentice animator and in-betweener on December 19, 1929. In April 1930, he started working on the four-month-old \"Mickey Mouse\" daily comic strip. It had originally been scripted by Walt Disney and drawn by Ub Iwerks who was succeeded by Win Smith. Iwerks later left Disney and tried to hire Gottfredson, but Roy Disney refused to allow Gottfredson out of his contract. In May, Win Smith refused to write the strip, and Disney assigned Gottfredson to it, promising it would be only a temporary arrangement until someone else could be found to take over. Gottfredson continued to produce the \"Mickey Mouse\" strips for the next 45 years.\nGottfredson's first daily strip was published in newspapers on his 25th birthday, May 5, 1930. In January 1932, he began work on the newly inaugurated \"Mickey Mouse\" color Sunday strip which, in addition to the daily, he continued through mid-1938. Gottfredson headed the comics department at Disney from 1930 to 1946, and was replaced by Frank Reilly.\nOriginally, Gottfredson wrote and drew the \"Mickey Mouse\" strip alone, but in 1932, he pulled back to plotting the stories and doing the penciling, while the dialogue was mostly done by other hands. Scripts were written by Webb Smith (1932\u201333), Ted Osborne (1933\u201338), Merrill De Maris (1933\u201342), Dick Shaw (1942\u201343), Bill Walsh (1943\u201364), Roy Williams (1962-69) and Del Connell (1968\u201388). Even so, Gottfredson always worked closely with his writers, and would often suggest changes in the scripts whenever he thought it would improve a story. There were a variety of inkers on the strip through the years; inkers for the Sunday strips included Al Taliaferro and Ted Thwaites in the 1930s, and Manuel Gonzales until 1981; Taliaferro also inked daily strips. Gottfredson returned to inking daily strips himself in 1947.\nFrom the beginning, the strips were parts of long continuing stories. These introduced characters such as the Phantom Blot, Eega Beeva, and the Bat Bandit, which Gottfredson created; Disney created Eli Squinch, Mickey's nephews, Morty and Ferdie Fieldmouse, and Sylvester Shyster, who were also introduced in the comic. Gottfredson plotted the continuities until Bill Walsh started writing the strip in 1943. The stories were always untitled. Titles were usually assigned later, when the strips or pages were reprinted in picture-books or comic books, which the artists had no influence on. Starting in the 1950s, Gottfredson and writer Bill Walsh were instructed to drop the storylines and do only daily gags. Gottfredson continued illustrating the daily strip until he retired on October 1, 1975.\nAnimation critic Geoffrey Blum said \"Gottfredson's Mormon upbringing and his unflaggingly positive outlook made him the perfect keeper for this icon. Never complaining, chocking back his hurts... this is the ethic he brought to Mickey. Gottfredson's mouse combines the virtues of a good citizen and a good soldier.\"\nReprints and compilations.\nGottfredson's Mickey strips were often collected in the 1930s and 1940s. Western Publishing's \"Big Little Book\" series based most of its Mickey volumes on the strip; Dell Publishing's \"Walt Disney's Comics and Stories\" serialized stories from the strip through 1948.\nModern-day American reprints began with \"The Bar None Ranch\" (1940), which appeared in \"Walt Disney Comics Digest\" #40 (1973). The following year \"The Bat Bandit\" (1934) appeared in a deluxe edition, \"The Best of Walt Disney Comics\". Abbeville Press' large size \"Best Comics\" anthologies in the late-1970s included two all-Gottfredson volumes (one headlined \"Goofy\"), though the stories were relettered and sometimes condensed. In 1980, Abbeville issued a small-size \"Best Comics\" series that included three all-Gottfredson volumes (again, one headlined \"Goofy\"), all of which reprinted stories from the earlier large-size editions. In 1986, Another Rainbow/Gladstone Publishing (and later Gemstone Publishing) began a tradition of serializing Gottfredson stories in regular Disney monthly comic books, which continued on and off until 2008, when they ceased publication. Gladstone also collected a number of Gottfredson's serials in the larger-size \"comic albums\" it issued during the 1980s; in 1990, Disney Comics issued \"Mickey Mouse Outwits the Phantom Blot\" (1939) in the same format.\nIn 2007, Gemstone Publishing announced \"The Floyd Gottfredson Library\", a comprehensive edition of Gottfredson's serialized stories (Mickey 1930\u20131955, plus later non-Mickey material). The series was postponed, then canceled once Gemstone no longer had the Disney license. In 2011, Fantagraphics Books resumed production of the series with the same editorial team, now titled \"Walt Disney's Mickey Mouse\". A total of 14 volumes were published between 2011 and 2018, collecting the entirety of Gottfredson's Sunday color work (two volumes) and all of his serialized daily strips (12 volumes).\nLegacy.\nIn the late 1970s and early 1980s, before his health deteriorated, Gottfredson gave interviews to many comics-oriented magazines as well as mainstream publications. The deluxe edition of the book \"Mickey Mouse in Color\" included a small record containing an audio interview with Gottfredson and Disney Donald Duck-comic book artist Carl Barks. During the 1970s, Gottfredson attended the OrlandoCon and in 1983 the San Diego Comic Book convention and annual convention of The Mouse Club.\nBetween 1978 and 1983, Gottfredson did a total of 24 paintings commissioned by collector Malcolm Willits, inspired by the success of the paintings of the Disney ducks done by Carl Barks. The paintings depict various storylines from the classic period of the Mickey strip.\nGottfredson's work had been printed in newspapers, magazines, and comic books worldwide for over 50 years, but as a Disney employee, he was never allowed to sign it. Gottfredson's identity was finally revealed in the mid-1960s by fan Malcolm Willits. Subsequently, reprints of his \"Mickey Mouse\" strips in the 1970s gave him credit.\nFloyd Gottfredson died at his home in Southern California at the age of 81. In 2006, Gottfredson was inducted into the Will Eisner Comic Industry Awards' Hall of Fame. He also was awarded an Inkpot Award in 1983.\nFellow Disney Legend Floyd Norman notes the drawing desk Gottfredson used today \"occupies a corner in a special room at Disney's Publishing department in Burbank.\"\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The shorts were the first work by what ultimately became The Walt Disney Company.\n\"Alice's Wonderland\".\nDisney, Ub Iwerks, and their staff made the first \"Alice Comedy\", a one-reel (ten-minute) 1923 short subject titled \"Alice's Wonderland\", while still heading the failing Laugh-O-Gram Studio in Kansas City, Missouri.\n\"Alice's Wonderland\" begins with Alice entering a cartoon studio to witness cartoons being created. Alice is amazed by what she sees: the cartoon characters come to life and play around. After heading to bed that night, she dreams of being in the cartoon world, welcomed by all of the characters. Alice plays with them until a group of lions break free from a cage and chase her. Though never released, this short helped set the stage for what was to come in the later \"Alice Comedies\", as it established the world as a playful dream and also introduced the elements which would soon define the series. The idea of setting a real-world girl in an animated world was at this point in film history still unique. The design and voice of the later series were all set by this original film.\nThe \"Alice Comedies\" series begins.\nAfter completing the film, the studio went bankrupt and was forced to shut down. After raising money by working as a freelance photographer, Disney bought a one-way train ticket to Los Angeles, California to live with his uncle Robert and his brother Roy. In California, Disney continued to send out proposals for the \"Alice\" series, in hopes of obtaining a distribution agreement. A deal was finally arranged through Winkler Pictures, run by Margaret Winkler and her fianc\u00e9, Charles Mintz. Because of a recent falling out with Pat Sullivan, the studio needed a quick replacement for their centerpiece Felix the Cat animated series. Disney convinced Davis's family to bring her from Missouri to Los Angeles to star in the series.\nShorts and subsequent releases.\nWalt Disney both directed and produced all 57 films in this series. Animation was done by Walt Disney, sometimes assisted by Rollin \"Ham\" Hamilton. Over the course of the series, four actresses played Alice: Virginia Davis (15), Margie Gay (31), Dawn O'Day (1) and Lois Hardwick (10). The film \"Alice in the Jungle\" contains only archival footage of Virginia Davis.\nThe shorts in this series are now all in the public domain in the United States. In 2000, Inkwell Images released \"Alice in Cartoonland \u2013 The Original Alice Comedies by Walt Disney\" in VHS, and in 2007 in DVD as part of the \"Golden Classics\" series with ten of the films as well as a documentary, poster gallery, and DVD ROM. In 2007, Kit Parker Films released another DVD called \"Alice in Cartoonland: The 35mm Collector's Set\". In 2005 and again in 2007, ten shorts in the series were released as part of the \"Walt Disney Treasures\" series. Seven were part of the \"Disney Rarities\" that was released in 2005, while three more were released as part of \"The Adventures of Oswald the Lucky Rabbit\", released in 2007.\nIn 2016, \"Alice\" shorts held by the EYE Film Institute in Amsterdam were restored for global re-release.\nA total of 16 \"Alice Comedies\" shorts are thought to be lost, and 1 \"Alice Comedies\" short (\"Alice's Auto Race\") has been partially found.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The cartoon, released by Walt Disney Animation Studios, is the first finished project to feature appearances of Mickey Mouse and Minnie Mouse, and was originally a silent film. It was given a test screening to a theater audience and potential distributors on May 15, 1928. An executive from Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer saw the film, but the film failed to pick up a distributor. Later that year, Disney released Mickey's first sound cartoon, \"Steamboat Willie\", which was an enormous success; \"Plane Crazy\" was officially released as a sound cartoon on March 17, 1929. It was the fourth Mickey film to be given a wide release after \"Steamboat Willie\", as well as \"The Gallopin' Gaucho\" and \"The Barn Dance\" (1929).\nPlot.\nMickey is trying to fly an airplane to imitate Charles Lindbergh. After building his own airplane, he does a flight simulation to ensure that the plane is safe for flight, but the flight fails, destroying the plane. Using a roadster, a turkey's tail and the remains of his plane to create a new plane, he asks his girlfriend Minnie to join him for its first flight after she presents him with a horseshoe for good luck. They take an out-of-control flight with exaggerated, impossible situations. Clarabelle Cow briefly \"rides\" the aircraft.\nOnce he regains control of the plane, he repeatedly tries to kiss Minnie. When she refuses, he uses force: he breaks her concentration and terrifies her by throwing her out of the airplane, catching her with the airplane, and he uses this to kiss her. Minnie responds by slapping Mickey and parachutes out of the plane using her bloomers. While distracted by her, Mickey loses control of the plane and eventually crashes into a tree. Minnie then lands, and Mickey laughs at her exposed bloomers. Minnie then storms off, rebuffing him. Mickey then angrily throws the good luck horseshoe given to him by Minnie, then flies and it boomerangs around a tree, hitting him and knocking him out.\nProduction.\nThe short was co-directed by Walt Disney and Ub Iwerks. Iwerks was also the sole animator for this short and spent just two weeks working on it in a back room, at a rate of over 700 drawings a day. It is also speculated Hugh Harman and Rudolf Ising might have done work for the short as well. The sound version contained a soundtrack by Carl W. Stalling, who recorded it on October 26, 1928, when he was hired, and a month before \"Steamboat Willie\" was released.\nThe point of view shot from the plane made it appear as if the camera was tracking into the ground. When they shot this scene, they piled books under the spinning background to move the artwork closer to the view.\nReception.\n\"The Film Daily\" (March 24, 1929): \"Clever. Mickey Mouse does his animal antics in the latest mode via areoplane. [sic] The cartoonist has employed his usual ingenuity to extract a volume of laughs that are by no means confined to the juveniles. The sound effects are particularly appropriate on this type of film, and certainly add greatly to the comedy angle with the absurd squeaks, yawps and goofy noises.\"\n\"Variety\" (April 3, 1929): \"Walt Disney sound cartoon, produced by Powers Cinephone, one of the Mickey Mouse series of animated cartoons. It's a snappy six minutes, with plenty of nonsensical action and a fitting musical accompaniment. Constitutes an amusingly silly interlude for any wired house. Disney has derived some breezy situations, one or two of them a bit saucy but, considering the animal characters, permissible.\"\nHome media.\nThe short was released on December 2, 2002, on ' and on December 11, 2007, on '.\nCopyright and preservation status.\nThe silent version was copyrighted on May 26, 1928, eleven days after it was test screened.

{"id": "74537", "revid": "4637213", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=74537", "title": "Brazil (1985 film)", "text": "1985 film by Terry Gilliam\nBrazil is a 1985 dystopian science fiction black comedy film directed by Terry Gilliam and written by Gilliam, Charles McKeown, and Tom Stoppard. A co-production between the United Kingdom and the United States, the film stars Jonathan Pryce, Robert De Niro, Katherine Helmond, Ian Holm, Bob Hoskins, Michael Palin, Ian Richardson, Peter Vaughan, and Kim Greist.\nThe film centres on Sam Lowry, a low-ranking bureaucrat trying to find a woman who appears in his dreams while he is working in a mind-numbing job and living in a small flat, set in a dystopian world in which there is an over-reliance on poorly maintained (and rather whimsical) machines and where people found guilty of crimes are liable for the costs of their interrogation by torture. \"Brazil\"'s satire of technocracy, bureaucracy, hyper-surveillance, corporate statism, and state capitalism is reminiscent of George Orwell's 1949 novel \"Nineteen Eighty-Four\", and it has been called \"Kafkaesque\" as well as absurdist.\nSarah Street's \"British National Cinema\" (1997) described the film as a \"fantasy/satire on bureaucratic society\", and John Scalzi's \"Rough Guide to Sci-Fi Movies\" (2005) described it as a \"dystopian satire\". Jack Mathews, a film critic and the author of \"The Battle of Brazil\" (1987), described the film as \"satirizing the bureaucratic, largely dysfunctional industrial world that had been driving Gilliam crazy all his life\". Despite its title, the film is not about the country Brazil nor does it take place there; it is named after the recurrent theme song, Ary Barroso's \"Aquarela do Brasil\", known simply as \"Brazil\" to British audiences, as performed by Geoff Muldaur.\nAlthough a success in Europe, the film was unsuccessful in its initial North American release. It has since become a cult film. In 1999, the British Film Institute voted \"Brazil\" the 54th greatest British film of all time. In 2017, a poll of 150 actors, directors, writers, producers and critics for \"Time Out\" magazine saw it ranked the 24th best British film ever.\nPlot.\nIn a dystopian, polluted, hyper-consumerist, overbearing, bureaucratic, totalitarian future based on elements of the 20th century, Sam Lowry is a low-level government employee who frequently dreams of himself as a winged warrior saving a damsel in distress. One day, shortly before Christmas, an insect becomes jammed in a teleprinter, which misprints a copy of an arrest warrant it was receiving. This leads to the arrest and death during interrogation of cobbler Archibald Buttle instead of suspected terrorist Archibald Tuttle.\nSam discovers the mistake when he finds that the wrong bank account has been debited for the arrest. He visits Buttle's widow to give her the refund where he catches a glimpse of her upstairs neighbour Jill Layton, a truck driver, and is astonished to discover that Jill resembles the woman from his dreams. Sam frantically tries to approach Jill, but she disappears before he can find her. Jill has been trying to help Mrs Buttle establish what happened to her husband, but her efforts have been obstructed by bureaucracy. Unbeknownst to her, she is now considered a terrorist accomplice of Tuttle for attempting to report the wrongful arrest of Buttle.\nMeanwhile, Sam reports a fault in his apartment's air conditioning. Central Services are uncooperative, but Tuttle unexpectedly comes to his assistance. Tuttle explains that he used to work for Central Services but left because of his dislike of the tedious and repetitive paperwork, and now illegally works as a freelance heating engineer. Tuttle repairs Sam's air conditioning, but when two Central Services workers, Spoor and Dowser, arrive, Sam has to stall to let Tuttle escape.\nSam discovers that Jill's records have been classified and the only way to access them is to be promoted to Information Retrieval. He had previously turned down a promotion arranged by his high-ranking mother Ida, who is obsessed with the rejuvenating plastic surgery of cosmetic surgeon Dr Jaffe. Sam retracts his refusal by speaking with Deputy Minister Mr Helpmann at a party hosted by Ida. After obtaining Jill's records, Sam tracks her down before she can be arrested. Sam clumsily confesses his love to Jill, and they cause mayhem as they escape government agents. They stop at a mall and are frightened by a terrorist bombing (part of a campaign that has been occurring around the city), then government agents arrive and take Sam. He awakens briefly detained in police custody.\nAt work, Sam is chastised by his new boss Mr Warrenn for his lack of productivity. Sam returns home to find that Spoor and Dowser have repossessed his apartment. Tuttle appears in secret and helps Sam exact revenge on the two Central Services workers by filling their environment suits with raw sewage. Jill finds Sam outside his apartment, and the two take refuge in Ida's unoccupied home, where they share their first kiss. Sam falsifies government records to indicate her death, allowing her to escape pursuit. The two spend the night together, but in the morning are apprehended by the government at gunpoint. Sam learns that Jill was killed during his arrest. Charged with treason for abusing his new position, Sam is restrained in a chair in a large, empty cylindrical room, to be tortured by his old friend Jack Lint.\nAs Jack is about to start the torture, Tuttle and other members of the resistance break into the Ministry, shooting Jack, rescuing Sam and blowing up the Ministry building. Sam and Tuttle flee together, but Tuttle mysteriously disappears amid a mass of scraps of paperwork from the destroyed building. Sam stumbles into the funeral of Ida's friend, who has died following botched cosmetic surgery.\nSam discovers that his mother now resembles Jill and is too busy being fawned over by young men to care about her son's plight. Government agents disrupt the funeral, and Sam falls into the open casket. Through a black void, he lands in a street from his daydreams and tries to escape police and monsters by climbing a pile of flex-ducts. Opening a door, he passes through it and is surprised to be in a truck driven by Jill. The two leave the city together.\nHowever, this \"happy ending\" is a delusion: it is revealed that Sam is still strapped to the torture chair. Realising that Sam has been permanently driven insane, Jack and Mr Helpmann declare him a lost cause and leave the room. Sam remains in the chair, smiling and humming \"Aquarela do Brasil\" to himself.\nCast.\nSupporting cast.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;* Jim Broadbent as Dr Louis Jaffe\nProduction.\nWriting.\nGilliam developed the story and wrote the first draft of the screenplay with Charles Alverson, who was paid for his work but was ultimately uncredited in the final film. For nearly 20 years, Gilliam denied that Alverson had made any material contribution to the script. When the first draft was published and original in-progress documents emerged from Alverson's files, however, Gilliam begrudgingly changed his story. This was too late for either credit on the film or a listing on the failed Oscar nomination for Alverson; he has said that he would not have minded the Oscar nomination, even though he didn't think much of the script or the finished film.\nGilliam, McKeown and Stoppard collaborated on further drafts. \"Brazil\" was developed under the titles \"The Ministry\" and \"1984\u00a0\u00bd\", the latter a nod to not only Orwell's original \"Nineteen Eighty-Four\" but also to \"8\u00bd\" directed by Federico Fellini; Gilliam often cited Fellini as one of the defining influences on his visual style. During the film's production, other working titles floated about, including \"The Ministry of Torture\", \"How I Learned to Live with the System\u2014So Far\", and \"So That's Why the Bourgeoisie Sucks\", before settling on \"Brazil\", relating to the name of its escapist signature tune.\nIn an interview with Salman Rushdie, Gilliam stated:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"Brazil\" came specifically from the time, from the approaching of 1984. It was looming. In fact, the original title of \"Brazil\" was \"1984 \u00bd\". Fellini was one of my great gods and it was 1984, so let's put them together. Unfortunately, that bastard Michael Radford did a version of \"1984\" and he called it \"1984\", so I was blown.\nGilliam sometimes refers to this film as the second in his \"Trilogy of Imagination\" films, starting with \"Time Bandits\" (1981) and ending with \"The Adventures of Baron Munchausen\" (1988). All are about the \"craziness of our awkwardly ordered society and the desire to escape it through whatever means possible\". All three movies focus on these struggles and attempts to escape them through imagination\u2014\"Time Bandits\", through the eyes of a child; \"Brazil\", through the eyes of a man in his thirties; and \"Munchausen\", through the eyes of an elderly man. In 2013, Gilliam also called \"Brazil\" the first installment of a dystopian satire trilogy, preceding \"12 Monkeys\" (1995) and \"The Zero Theorem\" (2013), although he later denied having said this.\nGilliam has stated that \"Brazil\" was inspired by George Orwell's \"Nineteen Eighty-Four\"\u2014which he has admitted never having read\u2014but is written from a contemporary perspective rather than looking to the future as Orwell had. In Gilliam's words, his film was \"the \"Nineteen Eighty-Four\" for 1984\". Critics and analysts have pointed to many similarities and differences between the two, an example being that contrary to Winston Smith, Sam Lowry's spirit did not capitulate as he sank into complete catatonia.\nThe film's ending bears a strong similarity to the short story \"An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge\" by Ambrose Bierce. The tragicomic tone and philosophy of the film bear many resemblances to absurdist drama, a genre for which \"Brazil\" co-writer Tom Stoppard is widely acclaimed.\nProduction design.\nMichael Atkinson of \"The Village Voice\" wrote, \"Gilliam understood that all futuristic films end up quaintly evoking the na\u00efve past in which they were made, and turned the principle into a coherent comic aesthetic.\"\nIn the second version of the script, Gilliam and Alverson described the film's setting: \"It is neither future nor past, and yet a bit of each. It is neither East nor West, but could be Belgrade or Scunthorpe on a drizzly day in February. Or Cicero, Illinois, seen through the bottom of a beer bottle.\" In the 1988 documentary \"The Birth of Brazil\", Gilliam said that he always explained the film as taking place \"everywhere in the 20th century, whatever that means, on the Los Angeles/Belfast border, whatever that means\". Pneumatic tubes are a frequent sight throughout the film.\nThe result is an anachronistic technology, \"a view of what the 1980s might have looked like as viewed from the perspective of a 1940s filmmaker\" that has been dubbed \"retro-futurism\" by fellow filmmakers Jean-Pierre Jeunet and Marc Caro. It is a mixture of styles and production designs derived from Fritz Lang's films (particularly \"Metropolis\" and \"M\") or film noir pictures starring Humphrey Bogart: \"On the other hand, Sam's reality has a '40s noir feel. Some sequences are shot to recall images of Humphrey Bogart on the hunt and one character (Harvey Lime) may be named as an homage to \"The Third Man\"'s Harry Lime.\"\nA number of reviewers also saw a distinct influence of German Expressionism, as the 1920s seminal, more nightmarish, predecessor to 1940s film noir, in general in how Gilliam made use of lighting and set designs. A brief sequence towards the end, in which resistance fighters flee from government soldiers on the steps of the Ministry, pays homage to the Odessa Steps sequence in Sergei Eisenstein's \"Battleship Potemkin\" (1925). Strong references exist to the overcomplicated humoristic machinery of British illustrator W. Heath Robinson, published between 1915 and 1942. The grotesque sets were based on George Grosz's paintings of 1920s Berlin.\nThe lighting and set design was coupled with Gilliam's trademark obsession for very wide lenses and tilted camera angles; going unusually wide for an audience familiar with mainstream Hollywood productions, Gilliam made the film's wide-angle shots with 14mm (Zeiss), 11mm and 9.8mm (Kinoptik) lenses, the latter being a recent technological innovation as one of the first lenses of that short a focal length that did not fisheye. In fact, over the years, the 14mm lens has become informally known as \"The Gilliam\" among filmmakers due to the director's frequent use of it since \"Brazil\".\nMany of the film's exterior scenes were filmed in \"Les Espaces d'Abraxas\" in Noisy-le-Grand near Paris, a monumental apartment complex designed by Ricardo Bofill Taller de Arquitectura.\nThe numbering of form &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Visible anchor/styles.css\" /&gt;27B/6, without which no work can be performed by repairmen with the Department of Central Services, is an allusion to George Orwell's flat at 27B Canonbury Square, London (up six half-flights of stairs), where he lived while writing parts of \"Nineteen Eighty-Four\".\nMusic.\nGeoff Muldaur performed a version of Ary Barroso's most famous 1939 song \"Aquarela do Brasil\" (\"Watercolor of Brazil\", often simply called \"Brazil\" in English). The song is a musical ode to the Brazilian motherland. Michael Kamen uses the song as a leitmotif in the film, although other background music is also used. Kamen's arrangement and orchestration of Barroso's song for \"Brazil\" made it more pliable to late 20th-century tastes, to the extent that film trailer composers often used it in contexts that had little to do with Brazil and more to do with Gilliam's dystopian vision.\nKamen, who scored the film, originally recorded \"Brazil\" with vocals by Kate Bush. This recording was not included in the film nor on the original soundtrack release. However, it has been subsequently released on re-releases of the soundtrack. Gilliam recalls drawing the inspiration to use the song while in Port Talbot, Wales in 1977:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;This place was a m\u00e9tallurgie city, where everything was covered by a gray metallic dust... Even the beach was completely covered by dust, it was really dusky. The sun was going down and was very beautiful. The contrast was extraordinary. I had this image of a man sitting there in this sordid beach with a portable radio, tuned in those strange escapist Latin songs like Brazil. The music took him away somehow and made the world seem less blue to him.\nSylvia Albertazzi, in her article \"Salman Rushdie's 'The Location of Brazil': The Imaginary Homelands of the Fantastic Literature\", stresses even further the importance that the soundtrack had on the movie's plot and meaning. She suggests, \"... the opening question 'where is Gilliam's Brazil?', may be answered, quite literally, 'in a song'; just as it is in a song that there is to be found that world where 'all fall down' in children's games.\"\nRelease.\nThe film was produced by Arnon Milchan's company Embassy International Pictures. Gilliam's original cut of the film was 142 minutes long and ends on a dark note. This version was released in Europe and internationally by 20th Century Fox without issue. However, the film's US distribution was handled by Universal Pictures, whose executives felt that the ending tested poorly. Universal's chairman, Sid Sheinberg, insisted on a dramatic re-edit of the film to give it a happy ending and suggested testing both versions to see which scored higher. At one point, there were two editing teams working on the film, one without Gilliam's knowledge. After a lengthy delay with no sign of the film being released, Gilliam took out a full-page ad in \"Variety\" urging Sheinberg to release \"Brazil\" in its intended version. Sheinberg spoke publicly in interviews of his dispute with Gilliam, and ran his own advertisement in \"Daily Variety\" offering to sell the film.\nGilliam conducted private screenings of \"Brazil\" (without the studio's approval) for film schools and local critics. On the same night when Universal's award contender \"Out of Africa\" premiered in New York, \"Brazil\" was awarded the awards for \"Best Picture\", \"Best Screenplay\" and \"Best Director\" at the Los Angeles Film Critics Association. This prompted Universal to finally agree to release a modified 132-minute version supervised by Gilliam in 1985.\nReception.\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, of critics' reviews are positive. The website's consensus reads: \"\"Brazil\", Terry Gilliam's visionary Orwellian fantasy, is an audacious dark comedy, filled with strange, imaginative visuals.\" On Metacritic, the film received a score of 84 based on 18 reviews, indicating \"universal acclaim\".\n\"Los Angeles Times\" critic Kenneth Turan described the film as \"the most potent piece of satiric political cinema since \"Dr. Strangelove\"\".\nJanet Maslin of \"The New York Times\" was very positive towards the film on its release, stating, \"Terry Gilliam's \"Brazil,\" a jaunty, wittily observed vision of an extremely bleak future, is a superb example of the power of comedy to underscore serious ideas, even solemn ones.\"\nRoger Ebert was less enthusiastic in the \"Chicago Sun-Times\", giving the film two stars out of four and claiming that it was \"hard to follow\". He felt that the film lacked a confident grasp on its characters' roles in a story \"awash in elaborate special effects, sensational sets, apocalyptic scenes of destruction and a general lack of discipline\". However, Ebert did say that \"there are several scenes in Brazil that show a lot of imagination and effort\". Ebert especially enjoyed one scene in which \"Sam moves into half an office and finds himself engaged in a tug-of-war over his desk with the man through the wall. I was reminded of a Chaplin film, \"Modern Times\", and reminded, too, that in Chaplin economy and simplicity were virtues, not the enemy.\"\nColin Greenland reviewed \"Brazil\" for \"Imagine\" magazine, and stated that it was \"a daring, exorbitant Vision, sombrely funny and darkly true\".\nAccording to Gilliam in an interview with Clive James in his online programme \"Talking in the Library\", \"Brazil\" is\u2014to his surprise\u2014apparently a favourite film of the far right in America.\nAccolades.\nIn 2004, \"Total Film\" named \"Brazil\" the 20th-greatest British movie of all time. In 2005, \"Time\" film reviewers Richard Corliss and Richard Schickel included \"Brazil\" in an unordered list of the 100 best films of all time. In 2006, Channel 4 voted \"Brazil\" one of the \"50 Films to See Before You Die\", shortly before its broadcast on FilmFour. The film also ranks at number 83 in \"Empire\" magazine's list of the \"500 Greatest Films of All Time\".\n\"Wired\" ranked \"Brazil\" at number 5 in its list of the top 20 sci-fi movies.\n\"Entertainment Weekly\" listed \"Brazil\" as the sixth-best science-fiction piece of media released since 1982. The magazine also ranked the film number 13 on its list of \"The Top 50 Cult Films\".\nThe film was nominated for two Academy Awards, for Best Original Screenplay and Best Art Direction (Norman Garwood, Maggie Gray).\nHome media.\nA directors' cut of \"Brazil\" was released on LaserDisc in the United States in December 1993. It was released by The Criterion Collection as a five-disc LaserDisc set in 1996 and a three-disc DVD set in 1999, featuring the 142-minute cut of the film (referred to by Gilliam as the \"fifth and final cut\"), Sheinberg's 94-minute \"Love Conquers All\" cut for syndicated television, and various galleries and featurettes. Criterion also released a one-disc, movie-only DVD edition in 2006, while the three-disc set was revised to be compatible with widescreen televisions.\nA Blu-ray of the 132-minute US version was released on 12 July 2011 by Universal Pictures. It contains only that version of the film and no extra features. The 142-minute cut was released on Ultra HD Blu-ray and a remastered Blu-ray by Criterion on 4 June 2025.\nLegacy.\nFilm.\nOther films that have drawn inspiration from \"Brazil\"'s cinematography, art design and overall atmosphere include Jean-Pierre Jeunet's and Marc Caro's films \"Delicatessen\" (1991) and \"The City of Lost Children\" (1995), Rocky Morton and Annabel Jankel's \"Super Mario Bros.\" (1993), the Coen brothers' \"The Hudsucker Proxy\" (1994) and Alex Proyas's \"Dark City\" (1998).\nThe production design and lighting style of Tim Burton's \"Batman\" (1989) have been compared to \"Brazil\". Tim Burton and production designer Anton Furst studied \"Brazil\" as a reference for \"Batman\".\nThe ending of Neil Marshall's \"The Descent\" (2005) is inspired by \"Brazil\"'s, as Marshall explained in an interview:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The original ending for \"Brazil\" was a massive inspiration for the original ending of \"The Descent\" \u2013 the idea that someone can go insane on the outside, but inside they've found happiness.\n\"Jupiter Ascending\" (2015) features a scene that is deliberately designed to resemble the bureaucracy in \"Brazil\", featuring Terry Gilliam in a cameo role and a reference to a \"statute 27B-stroke-6\".\nTelevision.\nProduction design of the Time Variance Authority depicted in the Disney+ series \"Loki\" is inspired by the \"fun sci-fi bureaucracy\" and dystopian design elements of \"Brazil\"'s Ministry of Information.\nIn the \"Rick and Morty\" episode \"The Ricklantis Mixup\", the ending of \"Brazil\" is referred to through a subplot involving a character who is attempting to escape the wafer factory where he works. He is captured but lives with the illusion that he has escaped, as with Lowry.\nIn the \"Futurama\" episode \"How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back\", Matt Groening and others in the DVD audio commentary cite \"Brazil\" as having influenced the depiction of the Central Bureaucracy.\nTechnology.\nThe highly technological aesthetics of \"Brazil\" inspired the set design of Max Cohen's apartment in the film \"Pi\". \"Brazil\" also served as an inspiration for the film \"Sucker Punch\" (2011), and has been recognised as an inspiration for writers and artists of the steampunk subculture.\nThe dystopian premise of the 2018 video game \"We Happy Few\" was largely inspired by \"Brazil\".\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "74546", "revid": "13286072", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=74546", "title": "Roanoke Island", "text": "Island in the Outer Banks of North Carolina, United States\nRoanoke Island () is an island in Dare County, bordered by the Outer Banks of North Carolina. It was named after the historical Roanoke, a Carolina Algonquian people who inhabited the area in the 16th century at the time of English colonization.\nAbout long and wide, the island lies between the mainland and the barrier islands near Nags Head. Albemarle Sound lies on its north, Roanoke Sound on the eastern, Croatan Sound on the west, and Wanchese CDP lies at the southern end. The town of Manteo is located on the northern portion of the island, and is the county seat of Dare County. Fort Raleigh National Historic Site is on the north end of the island. The island has a land area of and a population of 6,724 as of the 2000 census.\nToday U.S. Highway 64, a major highway, connects mainland North Carolina to the Outer Banks, as well as Roanoke Island. The island has recreational and water features, plus historical sites and an outdoor theater that form one of the major tourist attractions of Dare County.\nThe residents of Roanoke Island are governed by the Dare County Board of Commissioners. They are located within North Carolina's 1st congressional district.\nEtymology.\nThe island was named by English colonists after the Roanoke indigenous people who resided on the island for generations, at least 800 years prior to the arrival of the English in the New World. The meaning of the word Roanoke is derived from the Powhatan language, which was geographically close to the Roanoke. Roanoke means \"white beads made from shells\" (or more literally \"things rubbed smooth by hand\"). White beads were used as ornaments and currency among the Coastal Algonquian peoples of Virginia and North Carolina.\nJohn Smith, an English explorer and one of the first governors of Jamestown, Virginia, recorded the usage of the word \"Rawrenock\" in the Algonquin Powhowaten language.\nCuscarawaoke, where is made so much \"Rawranoke\" or white beads that occasion as much dissention among the savages, as gold and silver amongst Christians ...\nIn the context of the quote, \"Rawranoke \"refers to the items being traded, not the people. The Roanoke people became known by the English for trading shells prevalent at Roanoke Island and the other barrier islands of the Outer Banks. The Roanoke likely also exported the shells and white beads made from them to other distant cultures across the continent.\nHistory.\nOverview.\nFor millennia, this island was a site of ancient indigenous settlements. Archeological excavations in 1983 at the Tillett Site at \"Wanchese\" have revealed evidence of various cultures dating back to 8000 BC. \"Wanchese\" was used as a seasonal fishing village for 1500 years before English colonial settlement. Ancestors of the Algonquian-speaking Roanoke are believed to have coalesced as a people in about 400 CE, based on archeology and linguistics.\nRoanoke Island was the site of the Roanoke Colony, an English settlement initially established in 1585 by Sir Walter Raleigh. A group of about 120 men, women and children arrived in 1587. Shortly after arriving here, colonist Eleanor Dare, daughter of Governor John White, gave birth to Virginia Dare, the first English child born in North America. Governor White returned to England later that year for supplies.\nDue to impending war with Spain, White was unable to return to Roanoke Island until 1590. When he arrived, the colony had vanished. The fate of those first colonists remains a mystery to this day. Much speculation formed about their fate. Archaeologists, historians, and other researchers continue to work to resolve the mystery. Visitors to the Fort Raleigh National Historic Site can watch \"The Lost Colony\", the second-longest-running outdoor theatre production in the United States, which presents a conjecture about the decline of Roanoke Colony.\nRoanoke Island is one of the three oldest surviving English place-names in the U.S. Along with the Chowan and Neuse rivers, it was named in 1584 by Captains Philip Amadas and Arthur Barlowe, sent by Sir Walter Raleigh.\nAnother colony, more populous than the 16th century settlement by Raleigh, was developed at the island during the American Civil War. After Union forces took over the island in 1862, enslaved African Americans migrated there for relative freedom. The military considered them contraband and would not return them to Confederate slaveholders. The Army established the Roanoke Island Freedmen's Colony in 1863. In part it became an important social experiment, as a chance to develop a community of former slaves. The US government was developing policies related to the future of the formerly enslaved in freedom. Congregational chaplain Horace James was appointed as superintendent of the colony and of other contraband camps in North Carolina. With a view to making it self-sustaining, he had a sawmill built, and freedmen were allotted lands to cultivate. Those who worked for the Army were paid wages. When the United States Colored Troops were founded in 1863, many men from the colony enlisted. A corps of Northern teachers was sponsored by the American Missionary Association, and they taught hundreds of students of all ages at the colony.\n\"See also Roanoke People and Croatan People\".\nGeological formation and Pre-Columbian settlement.\nThe North Carolina Coast began to shape into its present form as the Outer Banks Barrier Islands. Previously, the North Carolina Coast had extended 50 miles eastward to the edge of the continental shelf. The melting of Northern Hemisphere Glaciers at least 14,000 years ago caused sea levels to rise. The Outer Banks and, by extension, the land of Roanoke Island began to stabilize around 6,000 B.C. Roanoke Island was originally a large dune ridge facing the Atlantic coastline and therefore is not a barrier island, contrasting with Bodie Island, which exists 2 miles to the east.\nArchaeological discoveries at the Tillett site in Wanchese, North Carolina, have dated the human occupation of Roanoke Island's land to 8,000 B.C. At the time, Native Americans across North America were developing in the Archaic Period. Archaeologists discovered that the land of Roanoke Island was part of the Mainland when it was first inhabited by the first Native Americans. For thousands of years, the development of Native American cultures on Roanoke Island corresponded with cultures occurring in the Coastal Plain of North Carolina.\nAround the year 400 AD, the area experienced an environmental transformation. The sand dune of Roanoke became disconnected from the mainland by water, and inlets in the Outer Banks turned freshwater sounds (lagoons) into brackish ecosystems. The land termed Roanoke Ridge became Roanoke Island. From approximately 460 AD to 800 AD, the Mount Pleasant Culture had a village on the Tillett Site in southern Roanoke Island, within the modern-day Wanchese township. After the year 800 AD, the village was occupied by the Colington Culture, a predecessor to the historic Roanoke tribe, who were encountered by the 1584 English Expedition.\nThe Roanoke people of the Tillett site had a semi-seasonal lifestyle: they inhabited the area from early Spring to early Fall, and the village was primarily based on fishing. During this yearly period, inhabitants consumed chiefly shellfish. Oysters and clams were the most common food sources, and the people left middens of shells that demonstrated their consumption. Roanoke women also gathered acorns and hackberry nuts to supplement their diets. The hunting of deer was relatively common, while the consumption of turtles was relatively rare. Lithium used for tools was maintained but not produced on the island and likely came from Bodie Island instead. Roanoke Indians had smoking pipes and used the seeds of plants such as Cleaver and Plantain for medicinal purposes. Four burials have been found at the site of Roanoke Indians of various social positions. The nobility of the culture had their skin and other soft parts of the body removed prior to burial, and after burial, preserved bodies would be transported to a temple. Tooth decay and diseases, including syphilis, were present in the community. It is extremely likely that the Roanoke had similar beliefs to the Virginian Algonquin tribes in that their great warriors and kings lived on in the afterlife, but that commoners lived only a mortal existence.\nEnglish maps and written accounts attest to other indigenous villages on Roanoke Island prior to European contact. Englishman Arthur Barlowe described a palisaded town with nine houses made of cedar bark on the far north end of Roanoke Island. According to historian David Stick, this second village was based on hunting land animals. All Roanoke Island villages were likely outlying tributaries of the Secotan's capital, Dasamonguepeuk, located on the western shore of the Croatan Sound on the modern-day mainland of Dare County. At the time of contact with the English, the Roanoke were estimated to have numbered from 5,000 to 10,000 members. The Roanoke Tribe, like many other tribes in the area, was loyal to the Secotan. In 1584, Wingina was their king.\nThe \"lost colony\".\nRoanoke Island was the site of the 16th-century Roanoke Colony, the first English colony in the New World. It was located in what was then called Virginia, named in honor of England's ruling monarch and \"Virgin Queen\", Elizabeth I.\nWhen the English first arrived in 1584, they were accompanied by a Croatoan native and a Roanoke native called Manteo and Wanchese respectively. The two men made history as the first two Native Americans to visit the Kingdom of England as distinguished guests. For over a year they resided in London. On the return journey, the two men witnessed English pirates plundering the Spanish West Indies.\nEnglish Scientist Thomas Harriot recorded the sense of awe with which the Native Americans viewed European technology:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nMany things they sawe with us ... as mathematical instruments, sea compasses ... [and] spring clocks that seemed to goe of themselves - and many other things we had - were so strange unto them, and so farre exceeded their capacities to comprehend the reason and meanes how they should be made and done, that they thought they were rather the works of gods than men.\nManteo took especially great interest in Western culture, learning the English language and helping Harriot create a phonetic transcription for the Croatoan language. By contrast, Wanchese came to see the English as his captors; upon returning home in 1585, he urged his people to resist colonization at all costs. The legacy of the two Indians and their distinct roles as collaborators and antagonists to the English inspired the names of Roanoke's towns.\nThe first attempted settlement was headed by Ralph Lane in 1585. Sir Richard Grenville had transported the colonists to Virginia and returned to England for supplies as planned. The colonists were desperately in need of supplies, and Grenville's return was delayed. While awaiting his return, the colonists relied heavily upon a local Algonquian tribe. In an effort to gain more food supplies, Lane led an unprovoked attack, killing the Secotan tribe's chieftain Wingina and effectively cutting off the colony's primary food source.\nAs a result, when Sir Francis Drake put in at Roanoke after attacking the Spanish colony of St. Augustine, the entire population abandoned the colony and returned with Drake to England. Sir Richard Grenville later arrived with supplies, only to find Lane's colony abandoned. Grenville returned to England with a Native American he named Raleigh, leaving fifteen soldiers to guard the fort. The soldiers were later killed or driven away by a Roanoke raid led by Wanchese.\nIn 1587, the English tried to settle Roanoke Island again, this time led by John White. At that time the Secotan Tribe and their Roanoke dependents were totally hostile to the English, but the Croatoan remained friendly. Manteo remained aligned with the English and attempted to bring the English and his Croatoan tribe together, even after the newcomers mistakenly killed his mother, who was also the Croatoan chief. After the incident Manteo was baptized into the Anglican Church. Manteo was then assigned by the English to be representative of all of the Native nations in the region; this title was mainly symbolic, as only the Croatoan nation followed Manteo. John White, father of the colonist Eleanor Dare and grandfather to Virginia Dare, the first English child born in the New World, left the colony to return to England for supplies. He expected to return to Roanoke Island within three months.\nBy this time, England itself was under threat of a massive Spanish invasion, and all ships were confiscated for use in defending the English Channel. White's return to Roanoke Island was delayed until 1590, by which time all the colonists had disappeared. The whereabouts of Wanchese and Manteo after the 1587 settlement attempt were also unknown. The only clue White found was the word \"CROATOAN\" carved into a post, as well as the letters \"CRO\" carved into a tree. Before leaving the colony three years earlier, White had left instructions that if the colonists left the settlement, they were to carve the name of their destination, with a Maltese cross if they left due to danger.\n\"Croatoan\" was the name of an island to the south (modern-day Hatteras Island) where the Croatoan people, still friendly to the English, were known to live. However, foul weather kept White from venturing south to Croatoan to search for the colonists, so he returned to England. White never returned to the New World. Unable to determine exactly what happened, people referred to the abandoned settlement as \"The Lost Colony.\"\nIn the book \"A New Voyage to Carolina\" (1709), the explorer John Lawson claimed that the ruins of the Lost Colony were still visible:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThe first Discovery and Settlement of this Country was by the Procurement of Sir Walter Raleigh, in Conjunction with some publick-spirited Gentlemen of that Age, under the Protection of Queen Elizabeth; for which Reason it was then named Virginia, being begun on that Part called Ronoak-Island, where the Ruins of a Fort are to be seen at this day, as well as some old English Coins which have been lately found; and a Brass-Gun, a Powder-Horn, and one small Quarter deck-Gun, made of Iron Staves, and hoop'd with the same Metal; which Method of making Guns might very probably be made use of in those Days, for the Convenience of Infant-Colonies.\nLawson also claimed the natives on Hatteras island claimed to be descendants of \"white people\" and had inherited physical markers relating them to Europeans that no other tribe encountered on his journey shared:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nA farther Confirmation of this we have from the Hatteras Indians, who either then lived on Roanoke Island, or much frequented it. These tell us, that several of their Ancestors were white People, and could talk in a Book, as we do; the Truth of which is confirm'd by gray Eyes being found frequently amongst these Indians, and no others. They value themselves extremely for their Affinity to the English, and are ready to do them all friendly Offices. It is probable, that this Settlement miscarry'd for want of timely Supplies from England; or thro' the Treachery of the Natives, for we may reasonably suppose that the English were forced to cohabit with them, for Relief and Conversation; and that in process of Time, they conform'd themselves to the Manners of their Indian Relations.\"\nLawson, John (1709). \"A New Voyage to Carolina\". University of North Carolina Press (1984). pp. 68\u201369. .\nFrom the time of the disappearance of the Lost Colony in 1587 to the Battle of Roanoke Island in 1862, Roanoke was largely isolated due to its weather and geography. Sand shoals on the Outer Banks and the North American continental shelf made navigation dangerous, and the lack of a deep-water harbor prevented Roanoke from becoming a major colonial port.\nIntermediate years.\n\"Also see: Province of Carolina and Province of North Carolina\"\nAfter the failure of the English Roanoke Colony, Native peoples inhabited the island for seventy more years. Archaeology from the Tilliet site indicates that the Roanoke population persisted until 1650. Written accounts indicate visible remnants of the final native presence which survived long after the end of the island's native population. A large mound 200 feet tall and 600 feet wide was recorded to exist in Wanchese in the early 1900s; now little evidence remains.\nThe 1650 extinction date corresponds with the final war between the Powhatan Tribe and the Virginia Colony that took place in 1646. Settlers from Virginia drove the Secotan Tribe out of Outer Banks region.\nSurvivors of the conflict fled southwards, forming the Machapunga tribe. The Machapunga fought alongside the Tuscarora Indians in the Tuscarora War (1711-1715). After their defeat in the conflict, most Machapunga settled and adapted to English lifestyles around Hyde County, North Carolina, other Machapunga fled northwards to join the Iroquois Confederation. The North Carolina descendants continued to carry some native customs until 1900 and now live in the Inner Banks of North Carolina.\nSome in the former Croatoan Tribe went to Hatteras Island prior to 1650, maintained good relations with the English and were granted a reservation in 1759. Descendants of the Croatoan-Hatteras tribes later merged with English communities. The 2000 federal census found that 83 descendants from the Roanoke and Hatteras Tribe lived in Dare County. Others lived in the states of New York, Maryland, and Virginia.\nWith Roanoke Island open for settlement, English Virginians moved from Tidewater Virginia to Northeast North Carolina's Albremarle Region. In 1665, The Carolina Charter established the colony of Carolina under a rule of landowners called the Lord Proprietors. Carolina under its original name \"Carolana \" included the territory of modern North and South Carolina. Early organized English towns in North Carolina include Elizabeth City and Edenton. Pioneers crossed southwards across the Albremarle Sound to settle in Roanoke Island. They came primarily to establish fishing communities but also practiced forms of subsistence agriculture on the Northern parts of Roanoke Island. Most of the Pioneers had originally immigrated to the American Colonies from Southern English parishes such as Kent, Middlesex and the West Country. Upon the creation of the Royal British Province of North Carolina in 1729, Roanoke Island became part of Currituck County. During the rule of the Lord Proprietors, Roanoke Island had been a part of the earlier Currituck Parish. It was during this time that historical families arrived including the Basnights, Daniels, Ehteridge, Owens, Tillets and others.\nOwnership at first belonged to the original Lord Proprietors, who had never visited the area even as Englishmen arrived and began to build houses. The Island was owned by both Carolina Governor Sam'L Stevens and Virginian Governor Sir William Berkley. Berkley inherited the island by marrying Steven's widow in 1670, and then sold the island to Joshua Lamb, a merchant, in 1676. The property was then sold and divided to a series of merchants from Boston (then part of the Massachusetts Bay Colony). Ownership by distant, far-away property holders continued until at least the 1750s. A Bostonian by the name of Bletcher Noyes gave power of attorney of his property to local William Daniels. English legal documents indicate the actual presence of settlers in 1676, with the possibility that the first Englishmen had made permanent homes much earlier.\nThere were no incorporated towns until Manteo was founded in 1899. From the 1650s to the Civil War period, the Virginia settlers developed a distinct \"Hoi Toider\" dialect across the Outer Banks. The island was ill-suited for commercial agriculture or for a deep water port and remained isolated with little interference from outsiders. The nearby community of Manns Harbor came into being as a small trading post where goods were transported across the Croatan Sound. Unlike inland North Carolina, the British authorities made no roads within or nearby Roanoke and the Tidewater region of North Carolina was avoided entirely. The development of colonial Roanoke Island also depended on the natural opening and closing of inlets on Bodi and Hatteras Islands to its east. As at other times, the Island was also struck by deadly hurricanes.\nDuring the Revolutionary War there were eight recorded encounters fought in nearby Hatteras, Ocracoke and the High Seas. These battles were between local privateers from Edenton against the British Royal Navy. The Royal Navy often had little place to rest during their coastal patrol duty. On August 15, 1776, a British patrol sent foragers to the now extinct \"Roanoke Inlet\" in modern-day Nags Head to steal cattle. The Outer Banks Independent Company who was guarding Roanoke Island killed and/or captured the entire party. This battle, while not on Roanoke Island itself, was less than three miles away. Skirmishes involving ships continued until 1780 but no large land battles occurred in the area. Roanoke Island itself was largely spared from war violence and independence for the United States had little effect on local residents.\nThirty years later during the War of 1812 the British Royal Navy planned for an Invasion of North Carolina's Outer Banks. The invasion was aborted on Hattaras Island because it was deemed there was nothing worthwhile for the British to occupy or pillage. The force then moved northward to attack Chesapeake Bay communities in Virginia. Roanoke Island continued its isolation until authorities of the Confederate States of America hastily prepared Roanoke Island to defend Coastal North Carolina from the invading Unionist Navy and Army. After passing by Cape Hatteras Union forces attacked Roanoke Island in 1862.\nCivil War years.\n\"Main Articles: Battle of Roanoke Island and Freedmen's Colony of Roanoke Island\"\nDuring the American Civil War, the Confederacy fortified the island with three forts. The Battle of Roanoke Island (February 7\u20138, 1862) was an incident in the Union North Carolina Expedition of January to July 1862, when Brigadier General Ambrose E. Burnside landed an amphibious force and took Confederate forts on the island. Afterward, the Union Army retained the three Confederate forts, renaming them for the Union generals who had commanded the winning forces: Huger became Fort Reno; Blanchard became Fort Parke; and Bartow became Fort Foster. After the Confederacy lost the forts, the Confederate Secretary of War, Judah P. Benjamin, resigned. Roanoke Island was occupied by Union forces for the duration of the war, through 1865.\nThe African slaves from the island and the mainland of North Carolina fled to the Union-occupied area with hopes of gaining freedom. By 1863, numerous former slaves were living on the fringe of the Union camp. The Union Army had classified the former enslaved as \"contrabands,\" and determined not to return them to Confederate slaveholders. The freedmen founded churches in their settlement and started what was likely the first free school for blacks in North Carolina.\nHorace James, an experienced Congregational chaplain, was appointed by the US Army in 1863 as \"Superintendent for Negro Affairs in the North Carolina District.\" He was responsible for the Trent River contraband camp at New Bern, North Carolina, where he was based. He also was ordered to create a self-sustaining colony at Roanoke Island and thought it had the potential to be a model for a new society in which African Americans would have freedom.\nIn addition to serving the original residents and recent migrants, the Roanoke Island Freedmen's Colony was to be a refuge for the families of freedmen who enlisted in the Union Army as United States Colored Troops. By 1864, there were more than 2200 freedmen on the island.\nUnder James, the freedmen were allocated plots of land per household, and paid for work for the Army. He established a sawmill on the island and a fisheries, and began to market the many highly skilled crafts by freed people artisans. James believed the colony was a critical social experiment in free labor and a potential model for resettling freedmen on their own lands. Northern missionary teachers, mostly women from New England, journeyed to the island to teach reading and writing to both children and adults, who were eager for education. A total of 27 teachers served the island, with a core group of about six.\nThe colony and Union troops had difficulty with overcrowding, poor sanitation, limited food and disease in its last year. The freedmen had found that the soil was too poor to support subsistence farming for so many people. In late 1865 after the end of the war, the Army dismantled the forts on Roanoke. In 1865, President Andrew Johnson issued an \"Amnesty Proclamation,\" ordering the return of property by the Union Army to former Confederate landowners. Most of the 100 contraband camps in the South were on former Confederate land. At Roanoke Island, the freedmen had never been given title to their plots, and the land was reverted to previous European-American owners.\nMost freedmen chose to leave the island, and the Army arranged for their transportation to towns and counties on the mainland, where they looked for work. By 1867 the Army had abandoned the colony. In 1870 only 300 freedmen were living on the island. Some of their descendants still live there.\nPostbellum period: becoming the seat of Dare County.\nIn the aftermath of the Civil War the area which is today Dare County was still split between Tyrell, Currituck and Hyde. Roanoke remained a part of Currituck.\nIn 1870 Dare County being named after the famous Virginia Dare became independent from the surrounding areas. Originally in April 1870 \"The Town of Roanoke Island\" was christened as the County Seat. In May of that year the town's name was changed to Manteo. The town of Manteo was the first place on in Dare County to have a federal post office. Roanoke Island went from being the outpost of Currituck to being the center of power in the new county. Dare County was allocated lands which included the Mainland, Roanoke Island and the beaches from Cape Hatteras upwards towards Duck.\nOutside Interest in the history of the Roanoke Island took hold for the first time. The State of the North Carolina protected the historical Fort Raleigh Site that had been the location of the 1584 and 1585 English expeditions. N.C State Senator Zebulon Vance attempted to build a monument in honor of the Colony in 1886 but was rebuffed by Congress because the bill would have distracted attention from Plymouth, Massachusetts.\nThe Town of Manteo grew as the center of business in Dare County, though it was not even the largest community in the county at the time. Buffalo City on the mainland had over 3,000 on the mainland but the community faded after the 1930s. Manteo while technically a new town was a combination of estates of landowners who had already resided on the island for two centuries. The organization of the town did spur new growth, as it became a central hub for the area. The waterfront become a bustling port with a network to Buffalo City, Edenton and Elizabeth City. Local fisherman, boat builders and landowners built fortunes whose wealth was later redistributed into new development.\nThere are five historically registered sites within Downtown Manteo all constructed during the turn of the 20th century. At the time Manteo carried a North American styled Queen Ann architecture combined with unique elements that reflected its coastal Environment. Churches such as Mount Olivet Methodist and Manteo Baptist were early community centers that guided local life. The construction of the island's first Court House symbolized the permanence of organized government. Manteo became Roanoke Island's only incorporated town in 1899.\nAs seasonal tourists began to take interest Roanoke became more aligned with the national American culture. In 1917 the Pioneer Theater was established showing movies from around the country, the theater remains in existence as one of America's remaining small theaters. The transition from a wholly subsistence to a partial consumer economy began to gradually take place on the eve of the construction of the first bridge.\nThe first bridge.\nThe communities of Roanoke were transformed by the construction of the first bridge connecting the island eastwards to Nags Head in 1924. For the first time, automobiles were introduced where travel by water or horse had been previously more common. The Baum bridge marked the first time that higher level infrastructure had been brought to the island. The 1924 bridge would be the only road connection to Roanoke Island for over thirty years. Around the same time, NC 345, Roanoke Island's first paved road for automobiles, was built and covered the entire extent of the land from the marshes of Wanchese to the Northend. The north edge of NC 345 corresponded with a ferry that went to Manns Harbor on the mainland. The North Carolina department of transportation subsidized the Roanoke Island ferry in 1934 to lower ticket costs and this was origin of the modern N.C ferry system.\nBoth Manteo in the north and Wanchese to the south were transformed by the construction of the first Nags Head bridge. Manteo which had previously been a small port reliant on trade with Elizabeth City and Edenton was now connected to a wider transportation network in both the North Carolina and Virginian Tidewater regions. The docks of Downtown Manteo began to decline as the bridge road became the center of commerce. Roanoke Island became industrialized for the first time in Wanchese. In 1936 the Wanchese Fish Cooperation was incorporated by the Daniels family as a processing and packing plant for fish, scallops and shrimp.\nAs Roanoke was introduced to the national market economy by the bridge, its fishing sales and local economy suffered from the Great Depression. Another blow was dealt in a 1933 Outer Banks Hurricane that made landfall in Hatteras before moving northwards toward Nova Scotia. Over 1,000 people lost their homes across Eastern North Carolina and 24 fatalities were reported. The waterfront of Manteo was destroyed by a severe fire in 1939.\nIn response to the crisis, the New Deal came to Roanoke Island to provide desperately needed employment and to highlight Roanoke's importance to the history of the United States. The outdoor theater play \"The Lost Colony\" written by Paul Green, began in 1936 and attracted the visit of President Franklin Roosevelt in 1937. The Lost Colony continues its performance every summer season. The onset of WWII with the German declaration of war in December, 1941 affected the island directly.\nThe \"Mother Vine\".\nPossibly the oldest cultivated grapevine in the world is the 400-year-old scuppernong \"Mother Vine\" growing on Roanoke Island. The scuppernong is the state fruit of North Carolina.\nEducation.\nThe island is in Dare County Schools. Residents are zoned to Manteo Elementary School, Manteo Middle School, and Manteo High School.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Sister-inline/styles.css\"/&gt; Media related to at Wikimedia Commons"}

The first colony was established at Roanoke Island in 1585 as a military outpost, and was evacuated in 1586. The more famous second colony, known as the Lost Colony, began when a new group of settlers under John White arrived on the island in 1587; a relief ship in 1590 found the colony mysteriously abandoned. The fate of the 112 to 121 colonists remains unknown. \nRoanoke Colony was founded by Governor Ralph Lane in 1585 on Roanoke Island in present-day Dare County, North Carolina. Poor relations with some of the local Native American tribes and a lack of supplies troubled Lane's colony. A resupply mission by Sir Richard Grenville was delayed, so Lane abandoned the colony and returned to England with Sir Francis Drake in 1586. Grenville arrived two weeks later and also returned home, leaving behind a small detachment to protect Raleigh's claim. A second expedition led by John White landed on the island in 1587. Sir Walter Raleigh had sent him to establish the \"Cittie of Raleigh\" on the Chesapeake Bay.\nDuring a stop to check on Grenville's men, ship's pilot Simon Fernandes forced White and his colonists to remain on Roanoke. White returned to England with Fernandes, intending to bring more supplies in 1588. The Anglo-Spanish War delayed his return to Roanoke until 1590, and he found the settlement fortified but abandoned. The word \"CROATOAN\" was found carved into the palisade, which White interpreted to mean that the colonists had relocated to Croatoan Island. Before he could follow this lead, rough seas and a lost anchor forced the mission to return to England. That attempt became known as the \"Lost Colony\".\nSpeculation that the colonists had assimilated with nearby Indian tribes appears in writings as early as 1605. Investigations by the Jamestown colonists produced reports that the Roanoke settlers had been massacred, and there were stories of people with European features being seen in Indian villages, but no conclusive evidence was found. Interest in the matter fell until 1834, when George Bancroft published his account in \"A History of the United States\". Bancroft's description of the colonists cast them as foundational figures in American culture, particularly White's infant granddaughter Virginia Dare, and it captured the public imagination.\nBackground.\nThe Outer Banks were explored in 1524 by Giovanni da Verrazzano, who mistook Pamlico Sound for the Pacific Ocean, and concluded that the barrier islands were an isthmus. Recognizing this as a potential shortcut to China, he presented his findings to King Francis I of France and King Henry VIII of England, neither of whom pursued the matter.\nIn 1578, Queen Elizabeth I granted a charter to Sir Humphrey Gilbert to explore and colonize territories \"unclaimed by Christian kingdoms\". Gilbert had helped to crush the first of the Desmond Rebellions in Ireland's Munster province in the early 1570s. The terms of the charter granted by the Queen were vague, although Gilbert understood it to give him rights to all territory in the New World north of Spanish Florida. Led by Gilbert, the English briefly claimed St. John's, Newfoundland, in 1583, as the first English territory in North America at the royal prerogative of Queen Elizabeth I, but Gilbert was lost at sea on his return journey to England.\nFollowing Gilbert's death in 1583, Queen Elizabeth divided the charter between his brother Adrian Gilbert, and his half-brother Sir Walter Raleigh. Adrian's charter gave him the patent on Newfoundland and all points north, where geographers expected to eventually find a long-sought Northwest Passage to Asia. Raleigh was awarded the lands to the south, though much of it was already claimed by Spain. Richard Hakluyt, however, had by this time taken notice of Verazzano's \"isthmus\" \u2013 located within Raleigh's claim \u2013 and was campaigning for England to capitalize on the opportunity.\nRaleigh's charter, issued on March 25, 1584, specified that he needed to establish a colony by 1591, or lose his right to colonization. He was to \"discover, search, find out, and view such remote heathen and barbarous Lands, Countries, and territories ... to have, hold, occupy, and enjoy\". It was expected that Raleigh would establish a base from which to send privateers on raids against the treasure fleets of Spain.\nDespite the broad powers granted to Raleigh, he was forbidden to leave the queen's side. Instead of personally leading voyages to the Americas, he delegated the missions to his associates and oversaw operations from London.\nAmadas\u2013Barlowe expedition.\nRaleigh quickly arranged an expedition to explore his claim. It departed England on April 27, 1584. The fleet consisted of two barques; Philip Amadas was captain of the larger vessel, with Simon Fernandes as pilot, while Arthur Barlowe was in command of the other. There are indications that Thomas Harriot and John White may have participated in the voyage, but no records survive which directly confirm their involvement.\nThe expedition employed a standard route for transatlantic voyages, sailing south to catch trade winds, which carried them westward to the West Indies, where they collected fresh water. The two ships then sailed north until July 4, when they sighted land at what is now called Cape Fear. The fleet made landfall on July 13 at an inlet north of Hatorask Island, which was named \"Port Ferdinando\" after Fernandes, who discovered it.\nThe Native Americans in the region had likely encountered, or at least observed, Europeans from previous expeditions. The Secotan, who controlled Roanoke Island and the mainland between Albemarle Sound and the Pamlico River, soon made contact with the English and established friendly relations. The Secotan chieftain, Wingina, had recently been injured in a war with the Pamlico, so his brother Granganimeo represented the tribe in his place.\nUpon their return to England in the autumn of 1584, Amadas and Barlowe spoke highly of the tribes' hospitality and the strategic location of Roanoke. They brought back two natives: Wanchese, a Secotan, and Manteo, a Croatan whose mother was the chieftain of Croatoan Island. The expedition's reports described the region as a pleasant and bountiful land, alluding to the Golden Age and the Garden of Eden, although these accounts may have been embellished by Raleigh.\nQueen Elizabeth was impressed with the results of Raleigh's expedition. In 1585, during a ceremony to knight Raleigh, she proclaimed the land granted to him \"Virginia\" and proclaimed him \"Knight Lord and Governor of Virginia\". Sir Walter Raleigh proceeded to seek investors to fund a colony.\nLane colony.\nFor the first colony in Virginia, Raleigh planned a largely military operation focused on the exploration and evaluation of natural resources. The intended number of colonists was 69, but approximately 600 men were sent in the voyage, with about half intended to remain at the colony, to be followed by a second wave later. Ralph Lane was appointed governor of the colony, and Philip Amadas would serve as admiral, although the fleet commander Sir Richard Grenville led the overall mission. Civilian attendants included Joachim Gans, metallurgist, Thomas Harriot, a scientist, and John White, an artist. Manteo and Wanchese, returning home from their visit to England, were also passengers on the voyage.\nVoyage.\nThe fleet consisted of seven ships: The galleass \"Tiger\" (Grenville's flagship, with Fernandes as pilot), the flyboat \"Roebuck\" (captained by John Clarke), \"Red Lion\" (under the command of George Raymond), \"Elizabeth\" (captained by Thomas Cavendish), \"Dorothy\" (Raleigh's personal ship, perhaps captained by Arthur Barlowe) and two small pinnaces.\nOn April 9, 1585, the fleet departed Plymouth, heading south through the Bay of Biscay. A severe storm off the coast of Portugal separated \"Tiger\" from the rest of the fleet and sank one of the pinnaces. Fortunately, Fernandes had a plan for such an occurrence, wherein the ships would meet up at Mosquetal, on the south coast of Puerto Rico. Proceeding alone, \"Tiger\" made good speed for the Caribbean, arriving at the rendezvous point on May 11, ahead of the other ships.\nWhile awaiting the fleet, Grenville established a base camp, where his crew could rest and defend themselves from Spanish forces. Lane's men used the opportunity as practice for building the fortifications that would be needed at the new colony. The crew also set about replacing the lost pinnace, forging nails and sawing local lumber to construct a new ship. \"Elizabeth\" arrived on May\u00a019, shortly after the completion of the fort and pinnace.\nThe remainder of the fleet never arrived at Mosquetal. At least one of the ships encountered difficulties near Jamaica and ran out of supplies, causing its captain to send twenty of his crew ashore. Eventually \"Roebuck\", \"Red Lion\", and \"Dorothy\" continued to the Outer Banks, arriving by mid-June. \"Red Lion\" left about thirty men on Croatoan Island and departed for privateering in Newfoundland. In the meantime, Grenville established contact with local Spanish authorities, in the hopes of obtaining fresh provisions. When the Spanish failed to deliver the promised supplies, Grenville suspected they would soon attack, so he and his ships abandoned the temporary fort.\nGrenville captured two Spanish ships in the Mona Passage, adding them to his fleet. Lane took one of these ships to Salinas Bay, where he captured salt mounds collected by the Spanish. Lane again built fortifications to protect his men as they brought the salt aboard. Grenville's ships then sailed to La Isabela, where the Spanish set aside hostilities to trade with the well-armed English fleet. On June\u00a07, Grenville left Hispaniola to continue to the Outer Banks.\nThe fleet sailed through an inlet at Wococon Island (near present-day Ocracoke Inlet) on June 26. \"Tiger\" struck a shoal, ruining most of the food supplies and nearly destroying the ship. There are indications that Grenville's fleet was supposed to spend the winter with the new colony, perhaps to immediately begin using it as a privateering base. The wreck of \"Tiger\", however, made that impossible. The remaining provisions could not support a settlement as large as had been planned. Moreover, the shallow inlets of the Outer Banks made the region unsuitable as a base for large ships. The colony's top priority would now be to locate a better harbour.\nAfter repairs, \"Tiger\" continued with the rest of the fleet to Port Ferdinando, where they reunited with \"Roebuck\" and \"Dorothy\". The men left behind by \"Red Lion\" were presumably also located during this time. On August\u00a05, John Arundell took command of one of the faster vessels and set sail for England, to report the expedition's safe arrival.\nEstablishment of the colony.\nThe loss of provisions from the \"Tiger\" meant that the colony would support far fewer settlers than originally planned. Grenville decided that only about 100 men would stay with Lane, which would be enough to fulfill the colony's objectives until another fleet, scheduled to leave England in June\u00a01585, could deliver a second wave of colonists and supplies. However, Grenville could not know that this expedition had been redirected to Newfoundland, to alert fishing fleets that the Spanish had begun seizing English commercial vessels in retaliation for attacks by English privateers. Until a resupply mission could be arranged, Lane's colony would be heavily dependent on the generosity of the natives.\nWhile the \"Tiger\" was under repair, Grenville organized an expedition to explore Pamlico Sound and the Secotan villages of Aquascogoc, Pamlico, and Secotan. His party made contact with the locals, presenting Harriot and White with an opportunity to extensively study Native American society. Although much of their research did not survive the 1586 evacuation of the colony, Harriot's extensive survey of Virginia's inhabitants and natural resources was published in 1588, with engravings of White's illustrations included in the 1590 edition.\nFollowing this initial exploration, a silver cup was reported missing. Believing the item stolen, Grenville sent Amadas to lead a detachment back to Aquascogoc to demand the return of the missing property. When the villagers did not produce the cup, the English decided that severe retribution was necessary in order to avoid the appearance of weakness. Amadas and his men burnt down the entire town and its crops, sending the natives fleeing.\nManteo arranged a meeting for Grenville and Lane with Granganimeo, to provide land for the English settlement on Roanoke Island. Both sides agreed that the island was strategically located for access to the ocean and to avoid detection from Spanish patrols. Lane began construction of a fort on the north side of the island. There are no surviving renderings of the Roanoke fort, but it was likely similar in structure to the one at Mosquetal.\nGrenville set sail for England aboard the \"Tiger\" on August 25, 1585. Days later, in Bermuda, Grenville raided a large Spanish galleon, the \"Santa Maria de San Vicente\", which had become separated from the rest of its fleet. The merchant ship, which Grenville took back to England as a prize, was loaded with enough treasure to make the entire Roanoke expedition profitable, spurring excitement in Queen Elizabeth's court about Raleigh's colonisation efforts.\nThe \"Roebuck\" left Roanoke on September 8, 1585, leaving behind one of the pinnaces under the command of Amadas. Records indicate that 107\u00a0men remained with Lane at the colony. However, historians disagree as to whether White returned to England with Grenville, or spent the winter at Roanoke despite his absence from the list of colonists.\nExploration.\nMany of the colonists had joined the mission expecting to discover sources of gold and silver. When no such sources were located, these men became dispirited and decided the entire operation was a waste of their time. The English also researched where the local Native Americans obtained their copper, but ultimately never tracked the metal to its origin. The colonists spent the autumn of 1585 acquiring corn from the neighboring villages, to augment their limited supplies. The colony apparently obtained enough corn (along with venison, fish, and oysters) to sustain them through the winter. Little information survives, however, about what transpired at the colony between September 1585 and March 1586, making a full assessment of the winter impossible. The colonists most likely exhausted their English provisions and American corn by October, and the resulting monotony of their remaining food sources no doubt contributed to the men's low morale.\nAmadas spent the winter exploring Chesapeake Bay, traveling as far as Cape Henry and the James River. While there his party made contact with the Chesapeake villages of Chesepioc and Skic\u00f3ak. The Secotans had described Skic\u00f3ak as the largest city in the region, possibly leading the English to expect something like the wealthy Inca and Aztec kingdoms encountered by the Spanish. Amadas instead found a more modest settlement, although he was impressed with the area's climate and soil quality. Harriot and Gans explored the Virginia territory, meeting Native American tribes and taking stock of natural resources. During his travels, Harriot and his assistants collected data that would eventually be used to produce White's \"La Virginea Pars\" map.\nAlthough 16th-century science could not explain the phenomenon, Harriot noticed that each town the colonists visited quickly suffered a deadly epidemic, which may have been influenza or smallpox. Some of the Secotan suspected the disease was caused by supernatural forces unleashed by the English. When Wingina fell sick, his own people could not treat him, but he recovered after requesting prayers from the English. Impressed, Wingina asked the colonists to share this power with other stricken communities, which only hastened the spread of disease. The epidemic likely had a severe impact on the fall harvest, at a time when Lane's colony would be heavily dependent on its neighbors to supplement its limited food supply.\nHostilities and food shortages.\nBy spring, relations between the Secotan and the colony were strained, most likely due to the colony's over-reliance on Secotan food. The death of Granganimeo, who had been a powerful advocate for the colony, apparently helped to turn Wingina against the English. Wingina changed his name to \"Pemisapan\" (\"one who watches\"), suggesting a newly cautious and vigilant policy, and established a new temporary tribal capital on Roanoke Island. The English did not initially recognize that these developments represented a threat to their interests.\nIn March, Lane consulted Pemisapan about a plan to explore the mainland beyond Secotan territory. Pemisapan supported the plan and advised Lane that the Chowanoke leader Menatonon was meeting with his allies to plan an attack on the English, and that three thousand warriors had gathered at Choanoac. At the same time, Pemisapan sent word to Menatonon that the English would be coming, ensuring that both sides would expect hostilities. When Lane's well-armed party arrived at Choanoac, he found representatives of the Chowanoke, Mangoak, Weapemeoc, and Moratuc. Since this gathering was not planning an attack, Lane caught them by surprise. He easily captured Menatonon, who informed him that it was Pemisapan who had requested the council in the first place.\nMenatonon quickly gained Lane's trust by offering information about lucrative opportunities in lands the English had not yet discovered. He described a rich and powerful king to the northeast (presumably the leader of the Powhatan), warning that Lane should bring a considerable force if he sought to make contact. Menatonon also corroborated rumors Lane had heard about a sea just beyond the head of the Roanoke River, apparently confirming English hopes of finding access to the Pacific Ocean. The chief's son Skiko described a place to the west called \"Chaunis Temoatan\" rich in a valuable metal, which Lane thought could be copper or perhaps even gold.\nBased on this information, Lane envisioned a detailed plan in which his forces would divide into two groups \u2013 one traveling north up the Chowan River, the other along the Atlantic coast\u2014to resettle at Chesapeake Bay. However, he decided to defer this mission until the colony received fresh supplies, which Grenville had promised would arrive by Easter. In the meantime, Lane ransomed Menatonon and had Skiko sent back to Roanoke as a hostage. He proceeded with forty men for about up the Roanoke River in search of Chaunis Temotan, but they found only deserted villages and warriors lying in ambush. Lane had expected the Moratuc to provide provisions for him along his route, but Pemisapan had sent word that the English were hostile and villagers should withdraw from the river with their food.\nLane and his party returned to the colony shortly after Easter, half-starved and empty-handed. During their absence, rumors had spread that they had been killed, and Pemisapan had been preparing to withdraw the Secotan from Roanoke Island and leave the colony to starve. There was no sign of Grenville's resupply fleet, which had not yet even left England. According to Lane, Pemisapan was so surprised that Lane returned alive from the Roanoke River mission that he reconsidered his plans. Ensenore, an elder among Pemisapan's council, argued in favor of the English. Later, an envoy for Menatonon informed Lane that the Weapemeoc leader Okisko had pledged fealty to Queen Elizabeth and Sir Walter Raleigh. This shift in the balance of power in the region further deterred Pemisapan from following through on his plans against the colony. He instead ordered his people to sow crops and build fishing weirs for the settlers.\nThe renewed accord between the English and the Secotan was short-lived. On April 20 Ensenore died, depriving the colony of its last advocate in Pemisapan's inner circle. Wanchese had risen to become a senior advisor, and his time among the English had convinced him that they were a threat. Pemisapan evacuated the Secotan from Roanoke, destroyed the fishing weirs, and ordered them not to sell food to the English. Left to their own devices, the English had no way to produce enough food to sustain the colony. Lane ordered his men to break up into small groups to forage and beg for food in the Outer Banks and the mainland.\nLane continued to keep Skiko as a hostage. Although Pemisapan met regularly with Skiko and believed him sympathetic to the anti-English cause, Skiko sought to honor his father's intention of maintaining relations with the colony. Skiko informed Lane that Pemisapan planned to organize a war council meeting on June 10 with various regional powers. With the copper the Secotan had gained from trading with the colony, Pemisapan was able to offer substantial inducements to other tribes to side with him in a final offensive against the English. Oksiko declined to get involved, although individual Weapemeocs were permitted to participate. The plan of attack was to ambush Lane and other key leaders as they slept at the colony, and then signal for a general attack on the rest. Based on this information, Lane sent disinformation to the Secotan indicating that an English fleet had arrived, to force Pemisapan's hand.\nForced to accelerate his schedule by the possibility of English reinforcements, Pemisapan gathered as many allies as he could for a meeting on May 31 at Dasamongueponke. That evening, Lane attacked the warriors posted at Roanoke, hoping to prevent them from alerting the mainland the following morning. On June 1, Lane, his top officers, and twenty-five men visited Dasamongueponke under the pretense of discussing a Secotan attempt to free Skiko. Once they were admitted into the council, Lane gave the signal for his men to attack. Pemisapan was shot and fled into the woods, but Lane's men caught up to him and brought back his severed head. The head was impaled outside the colony's fort.\nEvacuation.\nIn June, the colonists made contact with the fleet of Sir Francis Drake, on his way back to England from successful campaigns in Santo Domingo, Cartagena, and St. Augustine. During these raids, Drake had acquired refugees, slaves, and hardware with the intent of delivering them to Raleigh's colony. Upon learning of the colony's misfortunes, Drake agreed to leave behind four months of supplies and one of his ships, the \"Francis\". However, a hurricane hit the Outer Banks, sweeping the \"Francis\" out to sea.\nAfter the storm, Lane persuaded his men to evacuate the colony, and Drake agreed to take them back to England. Manteo and an associate, Towaye, joined them. Three of Lane's colonists were left behind and never heard from again. Because the colony was abandoned, it is unclear what became of the slaves and refugees Drake had meant to place there. There is no record of them arriving in England with the fleet, and it is possible Drake left them on Roanoke with some of the goods he had previously set aside for Lane. Drake's fleet, along with Lane's colonists, reached England in July\u00a01586. Upon arrival, the colonists introduced tobacco, maize, and potatoes to England.\nGrenville's detachment.\nA single supply ship, sent by Raleigh, arrived at Roanoke just days after Drake evacuated the colony. The crew could not find any trace of the colonists and left. Two weeks later, Grenville's relief fleet finally arrived with a year's worth of supplies and reinforcements of 400 men. Grenville conducted an extensive search and interrogated three natives, one of whom finally related an account of the evacuation. The fleet returned to England, leaving behind a small detachment of fifteen men both to maintain an English presence and to protect Raleigh's claim to Roanoke Island.\nAccording to the Croatan, this contingent was attacked by an alliance of mainland tribes shortly after Grenville's fleet left. Five of the English were away gathering oysters when two of the attackers, appearing unarmed, approached the encampment and asked to meet with two Englishmen peacefully. One of the Native Americans concealed a wooden sword, which he used to kill an Englishman. Another 28 attackers revealed themselves, but the other Englishman escaped to warn his unit. The natives set fire to the house where the English kept their food stores, thus forcing the men to take up whatever arms were handy. A second Englishman was killed; the remaining nine retreated to the shore, and fled the island on their boat. They found their four compatriots returning from the creek, picked them up, and continued onto a small island near the entrance to the Hatteras harbor. The thirteen survivors were never seen again.\nLost colony.\nDespite the desertion of the Lane colony, Raleigh was persuaded by Hakluyt, Harriot, and White to make another attempt. However, Roanoke Island would no longer be safe for English settlers, following the hostilities between Lane's men and the Secotan, and the death of Wingina. Hakluyt recommended Chesapeake Bay as the site for a new colony, in part because he believed the Pacific coast lay just beyond the explored areas of the Virginia territory. On January 7, 1587, Raleigh approved a corporate charter to found \"the Cittie of Raleigh\" with White as governor and twelve assistants. Approximately 115 people agreed to join the colony, including White's pregnant daughter Eleanor and her husband Ananias Dare. The colonists were largely middle-class Londoners, perhaps seeking to become landed gentry. Manteo and Towaye, who had left the Lane colony with Drake's fleet, were also brought along. This time, the party included women and children, but no organized military force.\nThe expedition consisted of three ships: the flagship \"Lion\", captained by White with Fernandes as master and pilot, along with a flyboat (under the command of Edward Spicer) and a full-rigged pinnace (commanded by Edward Stafford). The fleet departed on May 8.\nOn July 22, the flagship and pinnace anchored at Croatoan Island. White planned to take forty men aboard the pinnace to Roanoke, where he would consult with the fifteen men stationed there by Grenville, before continuing on to Chesapeake Bay. Once he boarded the pinnace however, a \"gentleman\" on the flagship representing Fernandes ordered the sailors to leave the colonists on Roanoke.\nThe following morning, White's party located the site of Lane's colony. The fort had been dismantled, while the houses stood vacant and overgrown with melons. There was no sign that Grenville's men had ever been there except for human bones that White believed were the remains of one of them, killed by Native Americans.\nFollowing the arrival of the flyboat on July 25, all of the colonists disembarked. Shortly thereafter, colonist George Howe was killed by a native while searching alone for crabs in Albemarle Sound.\nWhite dispatched Stafford to re-establish relations with the Croatan, with the help of Manteo. The Croatan described how a coalition of mainland tribes, led by Wanchese, had attacked Grenville's detachment. The colonists attempted to negotiate a truce through the Croatan, but received no response. On August 9, White led a pre-emptive strike on Dasamongueponke, but the enemy (fearing reprisal for the death of Howe) had withdrawn from the village, and the English accidentally attacked Croatan looters. Manteo again smoothed relations between the colonists and the Croatan. For his service to the colony, Manteo was baptized and named \"Lord of Roanoke and Dasamongueponke\".\nOn August 18, 1587, Eleanor Dare gave birth to a daughter, christened \"Virginia\" in honor of being \"the first Christian born in Virginia\". Records indicate Margery Harvye gave birth shortly thereafter, although nothing else is known about her child.\nBy the time the fleet was preparing to return to England, the colonists had decided to relocate up Albemarle Sound. The colonists persuaded Governor White to return to England to explain the colony's desperate situation and ask for help. White reluctantly agreed, and departed with the fleet on August 27, 1587.\n1588 relief mission.\nAfter a difficult journey, White returned to England on November 5, 1587. By this time reports of the Spanish Armada mobilizing for an attack had reached London, and Queen Elizabeth had prohibited any able ship from leaving England, so that they might participate in the coming battle.\nDuring the winter, Grenville was granted a waiver to lead a fleet into the Caribbean to attack the Spanish, and White was permitted to accompany him in a resupply ship. The fleet was set to launch in March 1588, but unfavourable winds kept them in port until Grenville received new orders to stay and defend England. Two of the smaller ships in Grenville's fleet, the \"Brave\" and the \"Roe\", were deemed unsuitable for combat, and White was permitted to take them to Roanoke. The ships departed on April 22, but the captains of the ships attempted to capture several Spanish ships on the outward-bound voyage (in order to improve their profits). On May 6 they were attacked by French mariners (or pirates) near Morocco. Nearly two dozen of the crew were killed, and the supplies bound for Roanoke were looted, leaving the ships to return to England.\nFollowing the defeat of the Spanish Armada in August, England maintained the ban on shipping in order to focus efforts on organizing a Counter Armada to attack Spain in 1589. White would not gain permission to make another resupply attempt until 1590.\nSpanish reconnaissance.\nThe Spanish Empire had been gathering intelligence on the Roanoke colonies since Grenville's capture of \"Santa Maria de San Vicente\" in 1585. They feared that the English had established a haven for piracy in North America, but were unable to locate such a base. They had no cause to assume Lane's colony had been abandoned, or that White's would be placed in the same location. Indeed, the Spanish greatly overestimated the success of the English in Virginia; rumors suggested the English had discovered a mountain made of diamonds and a route to the Pacific Ocean.\nFollowing a failed reconnaissance mission in 1587, Philip II of Spain ordered Vicente Gonz\u00e1lez to search Chesapeake Bay in 1588. Gonz\u00e1lez failed to find anything in Chesapeake, but on the way back he chanced to discover Port Ferdinando along the Outer Banks. The port appeared abandoned. Gonz\u00e1lez left without conducting a thorough investigation. Although the Spanish believed Gonz\u00e1lez had located the secret English base, the defeat of the Spanish Armada prevented Phillip from immediately ordering an attack upon it. In 1590, a plan was reportedly made to destroy the Roanoke colony and set up a Spanish colony in Chesapeake Bay, but this was merely disinformation designed to misdirect English intelligence.\n1590 relief mission.\nEventually, Raleigh arranged passage for White on a privateering expedition organized by John Watts. The fleet of six ships would spend the summer of 1590 raiding Spanish outposts in the Caribbean, but the flagship \"Hopewell\" and the \"Moonlight\" would split off to take White to his colony. At the same time, however, Raleigh was in the process of turning the venture over to new investors.\n\"Hopewell\" and \"Moonlight\" anchored at Croatoan Island on August\u00a012, but there is no indication that White used the time to contact the Croatan for information. On the evening of August 15, while anchored at the north end of Croatoan Island, the crews sighted plumes of smoke on Roanoke Island; the following morning, they investigated another column of smoke on the southern end of Croatoan, but found nothing. White's landing party spent the next two days attempting to cross Pamlico Sound, with considerable difficulty and loss of life. On August\u00a017 they sighted a fire on the north end of Roanoke and rowed towards it, but they reached the island after nightfall and decided not to risk coming ashore. The men spent the night in their anchored boats, singing English songs in hopes that the colonists would hear.\nWhite and the others made landfall on the morning of August\u00a018 (his granddaughter's third birthday). The party found fresh tracks in the sand, but were not contacted by anyone. They also discovered the letters \"CRO\" carved into a tree. Upon reaching the site of the colony, White noted the area had been fortified with a palisade. Near the entrance of the fencing, the word \"CROATOAN\" was carved in one of the posts. White was certain these two inscriptions meant that the colonists had peacefully relocated to Croatoan Island, since they had agreed in 1587 that the colonists would leave a \"secret token\" indicating their destination, or a cross patt\u00e9e as a duress code.\nWithin the palisade, the search party found that houses had been dismantled, and anything that could be carried had been removed. Several large trunks (including three belonging to White, containing the belongings he left behind in 1587) had been dug up and looted. None of the colony's boats could be found along the shore. The party returned to \"Hopewell\" that evening, and plans were made to return to Croatoan the following day. However, \"Hopewell\"'s anchor cable snapped, leaving the ship with only one working cable and anchor. The search mission could not continue given the considerable risk of shipwreck. \"Moonlight\" set off for England, but the crew of \"Hopewell\" offered a compromise with White, in which they would spend winter in the Caribbean and return to the Outer Banks in the spring of 1591. This plan fell through, though, when \"Hopewell\" was blown off course, forcing them to stop for supplies in the Azores. When the winds prevented landfall there, the ship was again forced to change course for England, arriving on October 24, 1590.\nInvestigations into Roanoke.\n1595\u20131602: Walter Raleigh.\nAlthough White failed to locate his colonists in 1590, his report suggested they had simply relocated and might yet be found alive. However, it served Raleigh's purposes to keep the matter in doubt; so long as the settlers could not be proven dead, he could legally maintain his claim on Virginia. Nevertheless, a 1594 petition was made to declare Ananias Dare legally dead so that his son, John Dare, could inherit his estate. The petition was granted in 1597.\nDuring Raleigh's first transatlantic voyage in 1595, he claimed to be in search of his lost colonists, although he later admitted this was misinformation to cover his search for El Dorado. On the return voyage, he sailed past the Outer Banks, and later claimed that weather had prevented him from landing.\nRaleigh later sought to enforce his monopoly on Virginia \u2013 based on the potential survival of the Roanoke colonists \u2013 when the price of sassafras skyrocketed. He funded a 1602 mission to the Outer Banks, with the stated goal of resuming the search. Led by Samuel Mace, this expedition differed from previous voyages in that Raleigh bought his own ship and guaranteed the sailors' wages so that they would not be distracted by privateering. However, the ship's itinerary and manifest indicate that Raleigh's top priority was harvesting sassafras far south of Croatoan Island. By the time Mace approached Hatteras, bad weather prevented them from lingering in the area. In 1603, Raleigh was implicated in the Main Plot and arrested for treason against King James, effectively ending his Virginia charter.\n1603: Bartholomew Gilbert.\nIn 1603 there was one final expedition with the intention of finding the Roanoke colonists, led by Bartholomew Gilbert. Their intended destination was Chesapeake Bay, but bad weather forced them to land in an unspecified location near there. The landing team, including Gilbert himself, was killed by a group of Native Americans for unknown reasons on July 29. The remaining crew were forced to return to England empty-handed.\n1607\u20131609: John Smith.\nFollowing the establishment of the Jamestown settlement in 1607, John Smith was captured by the Powhatan and met with both their leader Wahunsenacawh (often referred to as \"Chief Powhatan\") and his brother Opechancanough. They described to him a place called \"Ocanahonan\", where men wore European-style clothing; and \"Anone\", which featured walled houses. Later, after Smith returned to the colony, he made arrangements with Wowinchopunk, the king of the Paspahegh, to investigate \"Panawicke\", another place reportedly inhabited by men in European dress. The colony produced a crude map of the region with labels for these villages. The map also featured a place called \"Pakrakanick\" with a note indicating, \"Here remaineth four men clothed that came from Roonock to Ocanahawan.\"\nIn the summer of 1608, Smith sent a letter about this information, along with the map, back to England. The original map is now lost, but a copy was obtained by Pedro de Z\u00fa\u00f1iga, the Spanish ambassador to England, who passed it on to Philip III of Spain. The copy, now commonly referred to as the \"Z\u00fa\u00f1iga Map\", was rediscovered in 1890.\nSmith planned to explore Pakrakanick, but a dispute with the Paspahegh ended the mission before it could begin. He also dispatched two search parties, possibly to look for the other villages reported to him, with instructions to find \"the lost company of Sir Walter Rawley\". Neither group could find any sign of the Roanoke colonists living in the area.\nBy May 1609, word had reached England's Royal Council for Virginia that the 1587 colonists had been massacred by Wahunsenacawh. The source of this allegation is unknown. Machumps, Wahunsenacawh's brother-in-law, is known to have provided information about Virginia, and he had recently arrived in England. It has been speculated that the same voyage could have also delivered a letter from Smith, although no evidence for this exists.\nBased on this intelligence, as well as Smith's earlier report, the Council drafted orders for the Jamestown colony to relocate. These orders recommended \"Ohonahorn\" (or \"Oconahoen\"), near the mouth of the Chowan River, as a new base. Among the purported advantages of this location were proximity to \"Riche Copper mines of Ritanoc\" and \"Peccarecamicke\", where four of Raleigh's colonists were supposed to be held by a chieftain named \"Gepanocon\". These orders, along with the new acting governor, Thomas Gates, were delayed due to the shipwreck of the \"Sea Venture\" at Bermuda. Gates arrived at Jamestown in May 1610, several months into the Starving Time. The crisis may have deterred the colonists from attempting the proposed relocation. An expedition was sent to the Chowan River, but there is no record of its findings.\n1610\u20131612: William Strachey.\nWilliam Strachey arrived in Jamestown, along with Gates and Machumps, in May 1610. By 1612, he had returned to England, where he wrote \"The Historie of Travaile into Virginia Britannia\", an overview of the Virginia territory. He described \"Peccarecamek\", \"Ochanahoen\", \"Anoeg\", and \"Ritanoe\" in a manner consistent with Smith's map and the Virginia Council's orders to Gates. However, Strachey introduced additional details about \"the slaughter at Roanoak\".\nStrachey suggested that the lost colonists had spent twenty years living peacefully with a tribe beyond Powhatan territory. Wahunsenacawh, he claimed, carried out the unprovoked attack at the recommendation of his priests, shortly before the arrival of the Jamestown colonists. Based on this account, seven English \u2013 four men, two boys, and one woman \u2013 survived the assault and fled up the Chowan River. They later came under the protection of a chieftain named \"Eyanoco\", for whom they beat copper at \"Ritanoe\".\n\"The Historie of Travaile\" never directly identifies the tribe that supposedly hosted the Roanoke colonists. However, Strachey did describe an attack against the Chesepians, in which Wahunsenacawh's priests warned him that a nation would arise in Chesapeake Bay to threaten his dominion. It has been inferred that the colonists had relocated to Chesapeake, and both groups were massacred in the same attack.\nStrachey believed that the Powhatan religion was inherently Satanic, and that the priests might literally be in communion with Satan. He advocated for England to facilitate the Powhatans' conversion to Christianity. To that end, he recommended a plan in which King James would show mercy to the Powhatan people for the massacre of the Roanoke colonists, but demand revenge upon the priests. However, the London Company did not publish \"The Historie of Travaile\", which fell into obscurity until 1849. There is no indication that any actions were taken against Wahunsenacawh or his priests in retaliation for the alleged massacre.\n1625: Samuel Purchas.\nAfter the Powhatan attacked Jamestown in 1622, there was a dramatic shift in English commentary on Native Americans, as writers increasingly questioned their humanity. The London Company sponsored propaganda arguing that the massacre had justified genocidal retaliation, in order to assure potential backers that their investment in the colony would be safe.\nIn this context, Samuel Purchas wrote \"Virginia's Verger\" in 1625, asserting England's right to possess and exploit its North American claim. He argued that the natives, as a race, had forfeited their right to the land through bloodshed, citing the 1586 ambush of Grenville's garrison, an alleged attack on White's colonists, and the 1622 Jamestown massacre. Purchas offered no evidence for his claim about the 1587 colony except to state, \"Powhatan confessed to Cap. Smith, that hee had beene at their slaughter, and had divers utensills of theirs to shew.\"\nIt is possible Smith related the story of Wahunsenacawh's confession to Purchas, as they are known to have spoken together. Smith's own writings, however, never mention the confession, leaving Purchas' claim to stand alone in what historian Helen Rountree dismisses as \"an anti-Indian polemic\". Even if taken at face value, the alleged confession is not persuasive, as Wahunsenacawh might have invented the story in an attempt to intimidate Smith. The European artifacts allegedly offered as \"proof\" of a raid on the Roanoke colonists could just as easily have been obtained from other sources, such as Ajac\u00e1n.\n1701\u20131709: John Lawson.\nSea traffic through Roanoke Island fell into decline in the 17th century, owing to the dangerous waters of the Outer Banks. In 1672, the inlet between Hatorask and Croatoan islands closed, and the resulting landmass became known as Hatteras Island.\nDuring John Lawson's 1701\u20131709 exploration of northern Carolina, he visited Hatteras Island and encountered the Hatteras people. Although there is evidence of European activity in the Outer Banks throughout the 17th century, Lawson was the first historian to investigate the region since White left in 1590. Lawson was impressed with the influence of English culture on the Hatteras. They reported that several of their ancestors had been white, and some of them had gray eyes, supporting this claim. Lawson theorized that members of the 1587 colony had assimilated into this community after they lost hope of regaining contact with England. While visiting Roanoke Island itself, Lawson reported finding the remains of a fort, as well as English coins, firearms, and a powder horn.\nScientific research.\nResearch into the disappearance of the 1587 colonists largely ended with Lawson's 1701 investigation. Renewed interest in the Lost Colony during the 19th century eventually led to a wide range of scholarly analyses.\n1800s\u20131950: Site preservation.\nThe ruins that Lawson encountered in 1701 eventually became a tourist attraction. U.S. President James Monroe visited the site on April 7, 1819. During the 1860s, visitors described the deteriorated \"fort\" as little more than an earthwork in the shape of a small bastion, and reported holes dug nearby in search of valuable relics. Production of the 1921 silent film \"The Lost Colony\" and road development further damaged the site. In the 1930s, J. C. Harrington advocated for the restoration and preservation of the earthwork. The National Park Service began administration of the area in 1941, designating it Fort Raleigh National Historic Site. In 1950, the earthwork was reconstructed in an effort to restore its original size and shape.\n1998: Climate research.\nIn 1998, a team led by climatologist David W. Stahle (of the University of Arkansas) and archaeologist Dennis B. Blanton (of the College of William and Mary) concluded that an extreme drought occurred in Tidewater between 1587 and 1589. Their study measured growth rings from a network of bald cypress trees, producing data ranging from 1185 to 1984. Specifically, 1587 was measured as the worst growing season in the entire 800-year period. The findings were considered consistent with the concerns the Croatan expressed about their food supply.\n2005\u20132019: Genetic analysis.\nSince 2005, computer scientist Roberta Estes has founded several organizations for DNA analysis and genealogical research. Her interest in the disappearance of the 1587 colony motivated various projects to establish a genetic link between the colonists and potential Native American descendants. Examining autosomal DNA for this purpose is unreliable, as so little of the colonists' genetic material would remain after five or six generations. However, testing of Y chromosomes and mitochondrial DNA is more reliable over large spans of time. The main challenge of this work is to obtain a genetic point of comparison, either from the remains of a Lost Colonist or from one of their descendants. While it is conceivable to sequence DNA from 430-year-old bones, there are as yet no bones from the Lost Colony to work with. And, as of 2019, the project had yet to identify any living descendant.\nArchaeological research.\n1887\u2013present: Archaeological evidence.\nArchaeological research on Roanoke Island only began when Talcott Williams discovered a Native American burial site in 1887. He returned in 1895 to excavate the fort but found nothing of significance. Ivor No\u00ebl Hume would later make several compelling finds in the 1990s, but none that could be positively linked to the 1587 colony, as opposed to the 1585 outpost.\nAfter Hurricane Emily uncovered a number of Native American artifacts along Cape Creek in Buxton, North Carolina, anthropologist David Sutton Phelps Jr. organized an excavation in 1995. Phelps and his team discovered a ring in 1998, which initially appeared to be a gold signet ring bearing the heraldry of a Kendall family in the 16th century. The find was celebrated as a landmark discovery, but Phelps never published a paper on his findings, and neglected to have the ring properly tested. X-ray analysis in 2017 proved the ring was brass, not gold, and experts could not confirm the alleged connection to Kendall heraldry. The low value and relative anonymity of the ring make it more difficult to conclusively associate with any particular person from the Roanoke voyages, which in turn increases the likelihood that it could have been brought to the New World at a later time.\nA significant challenge for archaeologists seeking information about the 1587 colonists is that many common artifacts could plausibly originate from the 1585 colony, or from Native Americans who traded with other European settlements in the same era. Andrew Lawler suggests that an example of a conclusive find would be female remains (since the 1585 colony was exclusively male) buried according to Christian tradition (supine, in an east\u2013west orientation) which can be dated to before 1650 (by which point Europeans would have spread throughout the region). However, few human remains of any kind have been discovered at sites related to the Lost Colony.\nOne possible explanation for the extreme deficiency in archaeological evidence is shoreline erosion. The northern shore of Roanoke Island, where the Lane and White colonies were located, lost 928feet (283 m) between 1851 and 1970. Extrapolating from this trend back to the 1580s, it is likely that portions of the settlements are now underwater, along with any artifacts or signs of life.\n2011\u2013present; new archaeological sites.\nIn November 2011, researchers at the First Colony Foundation noticed two corrective patches on White's 1585 map \"La Virginea Pars\". At their request, the British Museum examined the original map with a light table. One of the patches, at the confluence of the Roanoke and Chowan rivers, was found to cover a symbol representing a fort at the head of Albemarle Sound. The faint outline of a fort, drawn in what might be invisible ink, was also discovered on the patch itself. One theory is that White may have been trying to conceal the fort from the Spanish, who saw the colony as a threat. The Spanish had sent an expedition to defeat the colony, but could not find the settlers.\nAs the symbol is not to scale, it covers an area on the map representing thousands of acres in Bertie County, North Carolina. However, the location is presumed to be in or near the large 16th-century Weapemeoc village of Mettaquem. In 2012, when a team prepared to excavate where the symbol indicated, archaeologist Nicholas Luccketti suggested they name the location \"Site X\", as in \"X marks the spot.\" In 2015 a team excavated the site.\nIn an October 2017 statement, the First Colony Foundation reported finding fragments of Tudor pottery and weapons at Site X, and concluded that these indicate a small group of colonists residing peacefully in the area. The challenge for this research is to convincingly rule out the possibility that such finds were brought to the area by the 1585 Lane colony, or the trading post established by Nathaniel Batts in the 1650s. In 2019, the Foundation announced plans to expand the research into land that has been donated to North Carolina as Salmon Creek State Natural Area.\nIn 2020, new artifacts were found in North Carolina which researchers believe may be from a colony of survivors of the Lost Colony. These were found at a site about fifty miles west of Roanoke Island. Analysis of the artifacts focused on determining whether they might be from the Lost Colony, since later settlers from other colonies such as Jamestown would have different items and different materials than the Lost Colony settlers, such as clay pipes, which were invented later. Another researcher found items at a site about fifty miles south of Roanoke Island.\nAnother dig by Mark Horton, an archaeologist from the University of Bristol, found European artifacts at the site of a Native American village on Hatteras Island, including part of a sword and part of a gun. This may be evidence that the settlers did indeed assimilate with local Native Americans.\nIn 2020 a book by Scott Dawson was published entitled \"The Lost Colony and Hatteras Island\" describing his efforts along with Horton to find artifacts relating to the colony. He also wrote articles in publications, including an article in the magazine \"American Heritage\", which described several significant artifacts: these included several objects that seemed to be manufactured by Europeans, including an olive jar, glass and various manufactured items.\nIn 2025, Dawson and Horton announced that another dig on Hatteras Island had uncovered significant amounts of hammerscale, small metal flakes which are a byproduct of forging iron, in a layer preliminarily dated to the late 16th century. Dawson and Horton posit that since a waste product like hammerscale would not have been traded, and the Native Americans would not have known to forge iron, this proves the presence of settlers on the island. However, skeptics point to the absence of an associated hearth, and to the possibility that the hammerscale might be the result of other processes. The results of the dig have not yet undergone peer review.\nHypotheses about the colony's disappearance.\nWithout evidence of the Lost Colony's relocation or destruction, speculation about their fate has endured since the 1590s. The matter has developed a reputation among academics for attracting obsession and sensationalism with little scholastic benefit.\nConjecture about the Lost Colonists typically begins with the known facts about the case. When White returned to the colony in 1590, there was no sign of battle or withdrawal under duress, although the site was fortified. There were no human remains or graves reported in the area, suggesting that everyone was alive when they left. The \"CROATOAN\" message is consistent with the agreement with White to indicate where to look for them, suggesting they expected White to look for them and wanted to be found.\nPowhatan attack at Chesapeake Bay.\nDavid Beers Quinn concluded that the 1587 colonists sought to relocate to their original destination \u2013 Chesapeake Bay \u2013 using the pinnace and other small boats to transport themselves and their belongings. A small group would have been stationed at Croatoan, to await White's return and direct him to the transplanted colony. Following White's failure to locate any of the colonists, the main body of the colonists would have quickly assimilated with the Chesepians, while the lookouts on Croatoan would have blended into the Croatan tribe.\nQuinn suggested that Samuel Mace's 1602 voyage might have ventured into Chesapeake Bay and kidnapped Powhatans to bring back to England. From there, these abductees would be able to communicate with Thomas Harriot, and might reveal that Europeans were living in the region. Quinn evidently believed circumstances such as these were necessary to explain optimism about the colonists' survival after 1603.\nAlthough Strachey accused Wahunsenacawh of slaughtering the colonists and Chesepians in separate passages, Quinn decided that these events occurred in a single attack on an integrated community, in April\u00a01607. He supposed that Wahunsenacawh could have been seeking revenge for the speculative kidnappings by Mace. In Quinn's estimation, John Smith was the first to learn of the massacre, but for political considerations he quietly reported it directly to King James rather than revealing it in his published writings. Despite Quinn's reputation on the subject, his peers had reservations about his theory, which relies heavily on the accounts of Strachey and Purchas.\nIntegration with local tribes.\nThe possibility that the missing colonists could have assimilated into nearby Native American tribes has been suggested since at least 1605. If this integration was successful, the assimilated colonists would gradually exhaust their European supplies (ammunition, clothing) and discard European culture (language, style of dress, agriculture) as Algonquian lifestyle became more convenient. Colonial-era Europeans observed that many people removed from European society by Native Americans for substantial periods of time \u2013 even if captured or enslaved \u2013 were reluctant to return; the reverse was seldom true. Therefore, it is reasonable to postulate that, if the colonists were assimilated, they or their descendants would not seek reintegration with subsequent English settlers.\nThis leaves open the question of which tribe, or tribes, the colonists assimilated into. It is widely accepted that the Croatan were ancestors of the 18th-century Hatteras, although evidence of this is circumstantial. The present-day Hatteras tribe identifies as descendants of both the Croatan and the Lost Colonists by way of the Hatteras.\nSome 17th-century maps use the word \"Croatoan\" to describe locations on the mainland, across Pamlico Sound from Roanoke and Hatteras. By 1700, these areas were associated with the Machapunga. Oral traditions and legends about the migration of the Croatan through the mainland are prevalent in eastern North Carolina. For example, the \"Legend of the Coharie\" in Sampson County was transcribed by Ernest M. Bullard in 1950.\nMore famously, in the 1880s, state legislator Hamilton McMillan proposed that the Native American community in Robeson County (then considered free people of color) retained surnames and linguistic characteristics from the 1587 colonists. His efforts convinced the North Carolina legislature to confer tribal recognition to the community in 1885, with the new designation of \"Croatan\". The tribe petitioned to be renamed in 1911, eventually settling on the name Lumbee in 1956.\nOther tribes purportedly linked to the Roanoke colonists include the Catawba and the Coree. S. A'C. Ashe was convinced that the colonists had relocated westward to the banks of the Chowan River in Bertie County, and Conway Whittle Sams claimed that after being attacked by Wanchese and Wahunsenacawh, they scattered to multiple locations: the Chowan River, and south to the Pamlico and Neuse rivers.\nReports of encounters with pale-skinned, blond-haired people among various Native American tribes occur as early as 1607. Although this is frequently attributed to assimilated Lost Colonists, it may be more easily explained by dramatically higher rates of albinism in Native Americans than in people of European descent. Dawson (2020) proposed that the colonists merged with the Croatan tribe; he claims, \"They were never lost. It was made up. The mystery is over.\" However, this conclusion has been called into question. Alain Outlaw, an archaeologist and faculty member at Christopher Newport University, called Dawson's conclusion \"storytelling, not evidence-based information\", while archaeologist Nick Luccketti wrote, \"I have not seen any evidence at Croatoan of artifacts that indicate that Englishmen were living there.\" In addition, the actual text of Dawson's 2020 book \"The Lost Colony and Hatteras Island\" admitted that there was no \"smoking gun\" of evidence that the colonists had assimilated with the tribe. The book was also not subject to peer review, leaving the question open in spite of the sensationalist headlines that accompanied its publication.\nAn archaeological dig by Mark Horton, an archaeologist from the University of Bristol, found European artifacts at the site of a Native American village on Hatteras Island, including part of a sword and part of a gun. This may be conclusive proof that the settlers did indeed assimilate with local Native Americans.\nAttempt to return to England.\nThe colonists could have decided to rescue themselves by sailing for England in the pinnace, left behind by the 1587 expedition. If such an effort was made, the ship could have been lost with all hands at sea, accounting for the absence of both the ship and any trace of the colonists. It is plausible that the colony included sailors qualified to attempt the return voyage. Little is known about the pinnace, but ships of its size were capable of making the trip, although they typically did so alongside other vessels.\nThe colonists may have feared that taking a standard route across the Atlantic Ocean, with a stop in the Caribbean, would place them at risk of a Spanish attack; and thus chosen to attempt a direct course to England instead. Making such a voyage was not unfeasible\u00a0\u2013 in 1563, French settlers at the failed Charlesfort colony on what is now Parris Island, South Carolina, built a crude boat and successfully (albeit desperately) returned to Europe. Alternatively, the Roanoke colonists could have sailed north along the coast, in the hopes of making contact with English fishing fleets in the Gulf of Maine.\nThe pinnace would not have been large enough to carry all of the colonists. Additionally, the provisions needed for a transatlantic voyage would further restrict the number of passengers. The colonists may have possessed the resources to construct another seaworthy vessel, using local lumber and spare parts from the pinnace. Considering that ships were later built by survivors of the 1609 \"Sea Venture\" shipwreck, it is at least possible that the Lost Colonists could produce a second ship that, with the pinnace, could transport most of their party. Even in these ideal conditions, however, at least some colonists would remain in Virginia, leaving open the question of what became of them.\nConspiracy against Raleigh.\nAnthropologist Lee Miller proposed that Sir Francis Walsingham, Simon Fernandes, Edward Strafford, and others participated in a conspiracy to maroon the 1587 colonists at Roanoke. The purpose of this plot, she argued, was to undermine Walter Raleigh, whose activities supposedly interfered with Walsingham's covert machinations to make England a Protestant world power, at the expense of Spain and other Catholic nations. This conspiracy would have impeded Raleigh and White from dispatching a relief mission until Walsingham's death in 1590. Miller also suggested that the colonists may have been separatists, seeking refuge in America from religious persecution in England. Raleigh expressed sympathy for the separatists, while Walsingham considered them a threat to be eliminated.\nAccording to Miller, the colonists split up, with a small group relocating to Croatoan while the main body sought shelter with the Chowanoke. The colonists, however, would have quickly spread European diseases among their hosts, decimating the Chowanoke and thereby destabilizing the balance of power in the region. From there Miller reasoned that the Chowanoke were attacked, with the survivors taken captive, by the \"Mandoag\", a powerful nation to the west that the Jamestown colonists only knew from the vague accounts of their neighbors. She concluded that the \"Mandoag\" were the Eno, who traded the captured surviving Lost Colonists as slaves, dispersing them throughout the region.\nMiller's theory has been challenged based on Walsingham's considerable financial support of Raleigh's expeditions, and the willingness of Fernandes to bring John White back to England, instead of abandoning him with the other colonists.\nSecret operation at Beechland.\nLocal legends in Dare County refer to an abandoned settlement called \"Beechland\", located within what is now the Alligator River National Wildlife Refuge. The area has had reports of small coffins, some with Christian markings, encouraging speculation of a link to the Lost Colony. Based on these legends, engineer Phillip McMullan and amateur archaeologist Fred Willard concluded that Walter Raleigh dispatched the 1587 colonists to harvest sassafras along the Alligator River. All records suggesting that the colony's intended destination was Chesapeake Bay, and that England had lost contact with the colony, were supposedly falsified to conceal the operation from Spanish operatives and other potential competitors.\nAccording to McMullan, Raleigh quietly re-established contact with the colony by 1597, and his sassafras expeditions were simply picking up the colonists' harvests. In this view, the colony was not truly abandoned until the secret of the colony's location died with Raleigh in 1618. After that point, McMullan argued, the colonists would have begun to assimilate with the Croatan at Beechland.\nThis hypothesis largely depends upon oral traditions and unsubstantiated reports about Beechland, as well as a 1651 map that depicts a sassafras tree near the Alligator River. A significant problem with the hypothesis is that Raleigh supposedly planned a sassafras farm in 1587, to capitalize on a dramatic increase in crop prices, so that he could quickly compensate for the great expense of the failed 1585 colony. The proposed financial motivation overlooks the fact that Richard Grenville's privateering recovered the cost of the 1585 expedition. Additionally, sassafras prices did not skyrocket in value until the late 1590s, well after the establishment of the 1587 colony.\nSpanish attack.\nPaul Green, while collecting material for a 1937 stage play, noticed that Spanish records from the period contained abundant references to Raleigh and his settlements. Spanish forces knew of English plans to establish a new Virginia base in 1587 and were searching for it before White's colonists had even arrived. The Spanish Empire had included most of North America in their Florida claim and did not recognize England's right to colonize Roanoke or Chesapeake Bay. Given the Spanish sack of Fort Caroline in 1565, the colonists likely recognized the threat they represented. However, the Spanish were still searching for the colony in Chesapeake Bay as late as 1600, suggesting that they also were unaware of its fate.\nCORA tree.\nIn 2006, writer Scott Dawson proposed that a Southern live oak tree on Hatteras Island, which bears the faint inscription \"CORA\" in its bark, might be connected to the Lost Colony. The CORA tree had already been the subject of local legends, most notably a story about a witch named \"Cora\" that was popularized in a 1989 book by Charles H. Whedbee. Nevertheless, Dawson argued that the inscription might represent another message from the colonists, similar to the \"CROATOAN\" inscription at Roanoke. If so, \"CORA\" might indicate that the colonists left Croatoan Island to settle with the Coree (also known as the Coranine) on the mainland near Lake Mattamuskeet.\nA 2009 study to determine the age of the CORA tree was inconclusive. Damage to the tree caused by lightning and decay has made it impossible to obtain a valid core sample for tree-ring dating. Even if the tree dates back to the 16th\u00a0century, establishing the age of the inscription would be another matter.\nDare Stones.\nFrom 1937 to 1941, a series of inscribed stones were discovered that were claimed to have been written by Eleanor Dare, mother of Virginia Dare. They told of the travelings of the colonists and their ultimate deaths. Most historians today believe that they are a fraud because investigations linked all but one to stonecutter Bill Eberhardt. The first one is sometimes regarded as different from the rest, based on a linguistic and chemical analysis, and as possibly genuine.\nIn popular culture.\nRaleigh was publicly criticized for his apparent indifference to the fate of the 1587 colony, most notably by Sir Francis Bacon. \"It is the sinfullest thing in the world\", Bacon wrote in 1597, \"to forsake or destitute a plantation once in forwardness; for besides the dishonour, it is the guiltiness of blood of many commiserable persons.\" The 1605 comedy \"Eastward Hoe\" features characters bound for Virginia, who are assured that the lost colonists have by that time intermarried with Native Americans to give rise to \"a whole country of English\".\nUnited States historians largely overlooked or minimized the importance of the Roanoke settlements until 1834, when George Bancroft lionized the 1587 colonists in \"A History of the United States\". Bancroft emphasized the nobility of Walter Raleigh, the treachery of Simon Fernandes, the threat of the Secotan, the courage of the colonists, and the uncanny tragedy of their loss. He was the first since John White to write about Virginia Dare, calling attention to her status as the first English child born on what would become US soil, and the pioneering spirit exhibited by her name. The account captivated the American public. As Andrew Lawler puts it, \"The country was hungry for an origin story more enchanting than the spoiled fops of Jamestown or the straitlaced Puritans of Plymouth... Roanoke, with its knights and villains and its brave but outnumbered few facing an alien culture, provided all the elements for a national myth.\"\nThe first known use of the phrase \"The Lost Colony\" to describe the 1587 Roanoke settlement was by Eliza Lanesford Cushing in an 1837 historical romance, \"Virginia Dare; or, the Lost Colony\". Cushing also appears to be the first to cast White's granddaughter being reared by Native Americans, following the massacre of the other colonists, and to focus on her adventures as a beautiful young woman. In 1840, Cornelia Tuthill published a similar story, introducing the conceit of Virginia wearing the skin of a white doe. An 1861 \"Raleigh Register\" serial by Mary Mason employs the premise of Virginia being magically transformed into a white doe. The same concept was used more famously in \"The White Doe\", a 1901 poem by Sallie Southall Cotten.\nThe popularity of the Lost Colony and Virginia Dare in the 19th and early 20th\u00a0centuries coincided with American controversies about rising numbers of Catholic and non-British immigrants, as well as the treatment of African Americans and Native Americans. Both the colony and the adult Virginia character were embraced as symbols of white nationalism. Even when Virginia Dare was invoked in the name of women's suffrage in the 1920s, it was to persuade North Carolina legislators that granting \"white\" women the vote would assure white supremacy. By the 1930s this racist connotation apparently subsided, although the VDARE organization, founded in 1999, has been denounced for promoting white supremacists.\nCelebrations of the Lost Colony, on Virginia Dare's birthday, have been organized on Roanoke Island since the 1880s. To expand the tourist attraction, Paul Green's play \"The Lost Colony\" opened in 1937 and remains in production today. President Franklin D. Roosevelt attended the play on August 18, 1937 \u2013 Virginia Dare's 350th\u00a0birthday.\nBereft of its full context, the colonists' sparse message of \"CROATOAN\" has taken on a paranormal quality in Harlan Ellison's 1975 short story \"Croatoan\" and Stephen King's 1999 television miniseries \"Storm of the Century\". It is also the name of a humanlike villain (portrayed by William Shatner) in the fifth season of King's \"Haven\". Croatoan also appears in the 2005 television series \"Supernatural.\" In the 1994 graphic novel \"\", \"Croatoan\" is the name of a powerful demon who, in the 20th century, attempts to sacrifice the entirety of Gotham City to Satan.\nThe 2011 \"American Horror Story\" episode \"Birth\" relates a fictional legend in which the Lost Colonists mysteriously died, and their ghosts haunted the local Native Americans until a tribal elder banished them with the word \"Croatoan\". This premise is expanded upon in the sixth season of the series, \"\", which presents a series of fictional television programs documenting encounters with the ghost colonists. The leader of the undead colonists, \"\", is depicted as John White's wife Thomasin, although there is no historical evidence that she was one of the colonists.\nIn the 2015 novel \"The Last American Vampire\", the colonists are the victims of a vampire named \"Crowley\"; the inscription \"CRO\" was thus an incomplete attempt to implicate him.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nWorks cited.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Rich in symbolic and mythological associations in many cultures, it is thought to have originated from Iran before being introduced and exported to other parts of Asia, Africa, and Europe, though also considered to be native to Indian Subcontinent (particularly Northern India) and Afghanistan.\nIt was introduced into Spanish America in the late 16th century and into California by Spanish settlers in 1769. It is widely cultivated throughout West Asia and the Caucasus region, South Asia, Central Asia, north and tropical Africa, the drier parts of Southeast Asia, and the Mediterranean Basin. The fruit is typically in season in the Northern Hemisphere from September to February, and in the Southern Hemisphere from March to May.\nThe pomegranate and its juice are variously used in baking, cooking, juice blends, garnishes, nonalcoholic drinks, and cocktails.\nEtymology.\nThe name \"pomegranate\" derives from medieval Latin , apple and , seeded. Possibly stemming from the old French word for the fruit, , the pomegranate was known in early English as apple of Granada\u2014a term that today survives only in heraldic blazons.\nGarnet derives from Old French by metathesis, from Medieval Latin as used in a different meaning \"of a dark red color\". This derivation may have originated from \"pomum granatum\", describing the color of pomegranate pulp, or from \"granum\", referring to red dye, cochineal.\nThe modern French term for pomegranate, , has given its name to the military grenade.\nPomegranates were colloquially called wineapples or wine-apples in Ireland, although this term has fallen out of use. It still persists at the Moore Street open-air market in central Dublin.\nDescription.\nThe pomegranate is a shrub or small tree growing high, with multiple spiny branches. It is long-lived, with some specimens in France surviving for 200 years. \"P.\u00a0granatum\" leaves are opposite or subopposite, glossy, narrow oblong, entire, long, and broad.\nThe flowers are bright red and in diameter, with three to seven petals. Some fruitless varieties are grown for the flowers alone.\nThe flower's anthers close around the stigma until maturity, the ovaries are divided internally into special compartments or locules of many suspended ovules covered in septum.\nFruit.\nThe pomegranate fruit husk is red-purple with an outer, hard pericarp, and an inner, spongy mesocarp (white \"albedo\"), which comprises the fruit's inner wall where seeds attach. Membranes of the mesocarp are organized as nonsymmetric chambers that contain seeds which are embedded without attachment to the mesocarp, also a result of fertilization to the divided ovary. Pomegranate seeds are characterized by having sarcotesta, thick fleshy seed coats derived from the integuments or outer layers of the ovule's epidermal cells. The number of seeds in a pomegranate can vary from 200 to about 1,400.\nBotanically, the fruit is a berry with edible seeds and pulp produced from the ovary of a single flower. The fruit is intermediate in size between a lemon and a grapefruit, in diameter with a rounded shape and thick, reddish husk.\nIn mature fruits, the juice obtained by compressing the seeds yields a tart flavor due to low pH (4.4) and high contents of polyphenols, which may cause a red indelible stain on fabrics. The pigmentation of pomegranate juice primarily results from the presence of anthocyanins and ellagitannins.\nCultivation.\n\"P. granatum\" is grown for its vegetable crop, and as ornamental trees and shrubs in parks and gardens. Mature specimens can develop sculptural twisted bark, multiple trunks, and a distinctive overall form. Pomegranates are drought-tolerant, and can be grown in dry areas with either a Mediterranean winter rainfall climate or in summer rainfall climates. In wetter areas, they can be prone to root decay from fungal diseases. They can tolerate moderate frost, down to about .\nInsect pests of the pomegranate can include the butterflies \"Virachola isocrates\", \"Iraota timoleon\", and \"Deudorix epijarbas\", and the leaf-footed bug \"Leptoglossus zonatus\", and fruit flies and ants are attracted to unharvested ripe fruit. \nPropagation.\n\"P. granatum\" reproduces sexually in nature, but can be propagated using asexual reproduction. Propagation methods include layering, hardwood cuttings, softwood cuttings, and tissue culture. Required conditions for rooting cuttings include warm temperatures within the 18\u201329\u00a0\u00b0C (65\u201385\u00a0\u00b0F) range and a semihumid environment. Rooting hormone increases rooting success rate, but is not required. Grafting is possible but impractical and tends to yield low success rates.\nVarieties.\n\"P. granatum\" var. \"nana\" is a dwarf variety of \"P.\u00a0granatum\" popularly planted as an ornamental plant in gardens and larger containers, and used as a bonsai specimen tree. It could well be a wild form with a distinct origin. It has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.\nThe only other species in the genus \"Punica\" is the Socotran pomegranate (\"P. protopunica\"), which is endemic to the Socotran archipelago of four islands located in the Arabian Sea, the largest island of which is also known as Socotra. The territory is part of Yemen. It differs in having pink (not red) flowers and smaller, less sweet fruit.\nCultivars.\n\"P. granatum\" has more than 500 named cultivars, but has considerable synonymy in which the same genotype is named differently across regions of the world.\nSeveral characteristics between pomegranate genotypes vary for identification, consumer preference, preferred use, and marketing, the most important of which are fruit size, exocarp color (ranging from yellow to purple, with pink and red most common), seed-coat color (ranging from white to red), the hardness of seed, maturity, juice content and its acidity, sweetness, and astringency.\nProduction and export.\nThe leading producers globally are India and China, followed by Iran, Turkey, Afghanistan, the US, Iraq, Pakistan, Syria, and Spain. During 2019, Chile, Peru, Egypt, Israel, India, and Turkey supplied pomegranates to the European market. Chile was the main supplier to the United States market, which has a limited supply from Southern California. China was self-sufficient for its pomegranate supply in 2019, while other South Asia markets were supplied mainly by India. Pomegranate production and exports in South Africa competed with South American shipments in 2012\u20132018, with export destinations including Europe, the Middle East, the United Kingdom, and Russia. South Africa imports pomegranates mainly from Israel.\nHistory.\nThe pomegranate is native to a region from Iran to northern India. Pomegranates have been cultivated throughout the Middle East, India, and the Mediterranean region for several millennia, and it is also cultivated in the Central Valley of California and in Arizona. Pomegranates may have been domesticated as early as the fifth millennium BC, as they were one of the first fruit trees to be domesticated in the eastern Mediterranean region.\nArchaeological findings confirm the early domestication of pomegranates in the ancient Near East. Remains of the fruit dating to the Neolithic period have been found at Gezer in Israel, and carbonized pomegranate exocarp has been recovered from early Bronze Age levels at Tell es-Sultan (Jericho) in the West Bank. Additional remains from this period have been found at Arad and Gezer in Israel. Evidence from the Late Bronze Age includes pomegranate remains at Hala Sultan Tekke in Cyprus and the site of Tiryns in Greece. A large, dry pomegranate was found in the tomb of Djehuty, the butler of Queen Hatshepsut in Egypt; Mesopotamian records written in cuneiform mention pomegranates from the mid-third millennium BC onwards.\nWaterlogged pomegranate remains have been identified at the circa 14th century BC Uluburun shipwreck off the coast of Turkey. Other goods on the ship include perfume, ivory and gold jewelry, suggesting that pomegranates at this time may have been considered a luxury good. Other archaeological finds of pomegranate remains from the Late Bronze Age have been found primarily in elite residences, supporting this inference. During the Iron Age, the pomegranate was a frequent decorative motif in Israelite material culture, appearing on ancient artifacts.\nIt is also extensively grown in southern China and Southeast Asia, whether originally spread along the Silk Road route or brought by sea traders. Kandahar is famous in Afghanistan for its high-quality pomegranates.\nAlthough not native to Korea or Japan, the pomegranate is widely grown there, and many cultivars have been developed. It is widely used for bonsai because of its flowers and for the unusual twisted bark the older specimens can attain. The term \"balaustine\" () is also used for a pomegranate-red color.\nSpanish colonists later introduced the fruit to the Caribbean and America (Spanish America). However, in the English colonies, it was less at home: \"Don't use the pomegranate inhospitably, a stranger that has come so far to pay his respects to thee,\" English Quaker Peter Collinson wrote to the botanizing John Bartram in Philadelphia, 1762. \"Plant it against the side of thy house, nail it close to the wall. In this manner it thrives wonderfully with us, and flowers beautifully, and bears fruit this hot year. I have twenty-four on one tree... Doctor Fothergill says, of all trees this is most salutiferous to mankind.\"\nThe pomegranate had been introduced as an exotic to England the previous century, by John Tradescant the Elder, but the disappointment that it did not set fruit there led to its repeated introduction to the American colonies, even New England. It succeeded in the South: Bartram received a barrel of pomegranates and oranges from a correspondent in Charleston, South Carolina, 1764. John Bartram partook of \"delitious\" pomegranates with Noble Jones at Wormsloe Plantation, near Savannah, Georgia, in September 1765. Thomas Jefferson planted pomegranates at Monticello in 1771; he had them from George Wythe of Williamsburg.\nUse.\nCulinary.\nPomegranate juice can be sweet or sour, but most fruits are moderate in taste, with sour notes from the acidic ellagitannins contained in the juice. Pomegranate juice has long been a common drink in Europe and the Middle East, and is distributed worldwide. Pomegranate juice is also used as a cooking ingredient. In Syria, it is added to intensify the flavor of some dishes such as \"kibbeh safarjaliyeh\".\nGrenadine syrup, commonly used in cocktails, originally consisted of thickened and sweetened pomegranate juice, but today is typically a syrup made just of sugar and commercially produced natural and artificial flavors, preservatives, and food coloring, or using substitute fruits (such as berries).\nBefore tomatoes (a New World fruit) arrived in the Middle East, pomegranate juice, pomegranate molasses, and vinegar were widely used in many Iranian foods; this mixture is still found in traditional recipes such as \"fesenj\u0101n\", a thick sauce made from pomegranate juice and ground walnuts, usually spooned over duck or other poultry and rice, and in \"ash-e anar\" (pomegranate soup).\nPomegranate seeds are used as a spice known as \"anar dana\" (from , pomegranate + seed), most notably in Indian and Pakistani cuisine. Dried whole seeds can often be obtained in ethnic Indian markets. These seeds are separated from the flesh, dried for 10\u201315 days, and used as an acidic agent for chutney and curry preparation. Ground \"anardana\" is also used, which results in deeper flavoring in dishes and prevents the seeds from getting stuck in teeth. Seeds of the wild pomegranate variety known as \"daru\" from the Himalayas are considered high-quality sources for this spice.\nDried pomegranate seeds, found in some natural specialty food markets, still contain some residual water, maintaining a natural sweet and tart flavor. Dried seeds can be used in several culinary applications, such as trail mix or granola bars, or as a topping for salad, yogurt, or ice cream.\nIn Turkey, pomegranate sauce () is used as a salad dressing, to marinate meat, or simply to drink straight. Pomegranate seeds are also used in salads and sometimes as garnish for desserts such as \"g\u00fclla\u00e7\". Pomegranate syrup, also called pomegranate molasses, is used in \"muhammara\", a roasted red pepper, walnut, and garlic spread popular in Syria and Turkey.\nIn Greece, pomegranate is used in many recipes, including \"kollivozoumi\", a creamy broth made from boiled wheat, pomegranates, and raisins, legume salad with wheat and pomegranate, traditional Middle Eastern lamb kebabs with pomegranate glaze, pomegranate eggplant relish, and avocado-pomegranate dip. Pomegranate is also made into a liqueur, and as a popular fruit confectionery used as ice cream topping, mixed with yogurt, or spread as jam on toast.\nIn Mexico, pomegranate seeds are commonly used to adorn the traditional dish \"chiles en nogada\", representing the red of the Mexican flag in the dish which evokes the green (poblano pepper), white (\"nogada\" sauce) and red (pomegranate seeds) tricolor.\nOther uses.\nPomegranate peels may be used to stain wool and silk in the carpet industry.\nNutrition.\nThe edible portion of raw pomegranate is 78% water, 19% carbohydrates, 2% protein, and 1% fat (table). A serving of pomegranate sarcotesta provides 11% of the Daily Value (DV) for vitamin C, 14% DV for vitamin K, and 10% DV for folate (table), while the seeds are a rich source of dietary fiber (20% DV).\nResearch.\nPhytochemicals.\nProcessing.\nThe phenolic content of pomegranate juice is degraded by processing and pasteurization techniques.\nJuice.\nThe most abundant phytochemicals in pomegranate juice are polyphenols, including the hydrolyzable tannins called ellagitannins formed when ellagic acid and gallic acid bind with a carbohydrate to form pomegranate ellagitannins, also known as punicalagins. The red color of the juice is attributed to anthocyanins, such as delphinidin, cyanidin, and glycosides of pelargonidin. Generally, an increase in juice pigmentation occurs during fruit ripening.\nPeel.\nPomegranate peel contains high amount of polyphenols, condensed tannins, catechins, and prodelphinidins. The higher phenolic content of the peel yields extracts for use in dietary supplements and food preservatives.\nSeed.\nPomegranate seed oil contains punicic acid (65%), palmitic acid (5%), stearic acid (2%), oleic acid (6%), and linoleic acid (7%).\nHealth claims.\nDespite limited research data, manufacturers and marketers of pomegranate juice have liberally used results from preliminary research to promote products. In February 2010, the FDA issued a warning letter to one such manufacturer, POM Wonderful, for using published literature to make illegal claims of unproven antidisease effects.\nIn May 2016, the US Federal Trade Commission declared that POM Wonderful could not make health claims in its advertising, followed by a US Supreme Court ruling that declined a request by POM Wonderful to review the court ruling, upholding the FTC decision.\nSymbolism.\nAncient Assyria.\nThe pomegranate was an important fruit in the culture and rituals of ancient Assyria. The Mesopotamian goddess of healing, Gula, was commonly depicted with a pomegranate in her hand, symbolizing it as a means of protection and healing from sickness. Pomegranates were commonly used in ceremonies to promote agriculture and human reproduction, especially the seeds. It was believed that eating pomegranates would grant a long and prosperous life, as well as nourishment in the afterlife, due to the belief of the seeds representing eternal life. \nPomegranates were also commonly depicted in Assyrian art pieces to depict abundance and fruitfulness with the agricultural cycle, and in the Metropolitan Museum of Art is an ivory bead object titled Pomegranate carved in the round. Today, the pomegranate remains an important symbol in modern Assyrian culture.\nAncient Iran.\nPomegranate, known as in Persian, is a symbol of fertility, blessing, and favor in Iranian belief. Pomegranates are sacred in the Zoroastrian religion and Zoroastrians used it in their religious rituals. The yellow color of the pomegranate stamens symbolizes the sun and light.\nThe pomegranate tree has been one of the most sacred and holy plants in Iran and is believed to be grown from places where the blood of Siavash (the legendary Iranian character who is known for his innocence) was spilled. It has been mentioned in Iranian Pahlavi scripts as a fruit of heaven. It is also believed that the invulnerability of Esfandiar (Iranian legend) was related to this sacred fruit. The Zoroastrians of Iran believe that pomegranate is a blessed fruit as it is served in their festivals like Mehregan and Nowruz, and especially in their wedding ceremonies to wish for the newly married couple to have healthy children in the future. They also used to plant a pomegranate tree in their fire temples to use its leaves in their ceremonies.\nDuring the Iranian tradition, Yalda Night, people come together on winter solstice and eat pomegranate fruit to celebrate the victory of light over darkness.\nIn a relief from Persepolis, Darius the Great is holding a pomegranate flower with two buds. This Achaemenid king is accepting the representatives of all the subordinate lands of Greater Iran to his presence, while holding a large flower in his hand as a sign of peace and friendship.\nAncient Egypt.\nAncient Egyptians regarded the pomegranate as a symbol of prosperity and ambition. It was referred to by the Semitic names of \"jnhm\" or \"nhm\". According to the Ebers Papyrus, one of the oldest medical writings from around 1500 BC, Egyptians used the pomegranate for treatment of tapeworm and other infections.\nAncient and modern Greece.\nA pomegranate is displayed on coins from Side, as \"Side\" was the name for \"pomegranate\" in the local language, which is the city's name. The ancient Greek city of Side was in Pamphylia, a former region on the southern Mediterranean coast of Asia Minor (modern-day Antalya province, Turkey).\nThe Greeks were familiar with the fruit far before it was introduced to Rome via Carthage, and it figures in multiple myths and artworks. In Ancient Greek mythology, the pomegranate was known as the \"fruit of the dead\", and believed to have sprung from the blood of Adonis.\nThe myth of Persephone, the goddess of the underworld, prominently features her consumption of pomegranate seeds, requiring her to spend a certain number of months in the underworld every year. The number of seeds and therefore months vary. During the months that Persephone sits on the throne of the underworld beside her husband Hades, her mother Demeter mourns and no longer gives fertility to the earth. This was an ancient Greek explanation for the seasons.\nAccording to Carl A. P. Ruck and Danny Staples, the chambered pomegranate is also a surrogate for the poppy's narcotic capsule, with its comparable shape and chambered interior.\nIn another Greek myth, a girl named Side (\"pomegranate\") killed herself on her mother's grave to avoid suffering rape at the hands of her own father Ictinus. Her blood transformed into a pomegranate tree. In a different myth, a Boeotian woman named Side was cast into the Underworld by Hera, with the pomegranate symbolising her descent.\nIn the fifth century BC, Polycleitus took ivory and gold to sculpt the seated Argive Hera in her temple. She held a scepter in one hand and offered a pomegranate, like a \"royal orb\", in the other. \"About the pomegranate I must say nothing,\" whispered the traveller Pausanias in the second century, \"for its story is somewhat of a holy mystery\". The pomegranate has a calyx shaped like a crown. In Jewish tradition, it has been seen as the original \"design\" for the proper crown.\nWithin the Heraion at the mouth of the Sele, near Paestum, Magna Graecia, is a chapel devoted to the \"Madonna del Granato\", \"Our Lady of the Pomegranate\", \"who by virtue of her epithet and the attribute of a pomegranate must be the Christian successor of the ancient Greek goddess Hera\", observes the excavator of the Heraion of Samos, Helmut Kyrieleis.\nIn modern times, the pomegranate still holds strong symbolic meanings for the Greeks. When one buys a new home, it is conventional for a house guest to bring as a first gift a pomegranate, which is placed under/near the \"ikonostasi\" (home altar) of the house, as a symbol of abundance, fertility, and good luck. When Greeks commemorate their dead, they make \"kollyva\" as offerings, which consist of boiled wheat, mixed with sugar and decorated with pomegranate. Pomegranate decorations for the home are very common in Greece and sold in most home goods stores.\nAncient Israel and Judaism.\nHebrew Bible.\nPomegranates are one of the Seven Species (Hebrew: , ) of fruits and grains enumerated in the Hebrew Bible () as special products of the Land of Israel. The \"Song of Songs\" (also known as the \"Song of Solomon\") mentions the pomegranate six times, often as a symbol of beauty and fertility. In one verse, the female lover is described: Your lips are like a crimson thread, and your mouth is lovely. Your cheeks are like halves of a pomegranate behind your veil\" ().\nSome Jewish scholars believe the pomegranate was the forbidden fruit in the Garden of Eden, as described in the Book of Genesis. The Book of Exodus describes the \"me'il\" (\"robe of the ephod\") worn by the Hebrew high priest as having pomegranates embroidered on the hem, alternating with golden bells, which could be heard as the high priest entered and left the Holy of Holies. In the Book of Numbers, pomegranates are listed among the fruits that the scouts brought to Moses to demonstrate the fertility of the \"Promised Land\". According to the Books of Kings, the capitals of the two pillars (Jachin and Boaz) that stood in front of Solomon's Temple in Jerusalem were engraved with pomegranates. Solomon is said to have designed his coronet based on the pomegranate's \"crown\" (calyx).\nHistorical and traditional use.\nThe pomegranate appeared on the ancient coins of Judaea, see Hasmonean, Herodian and First Jewish Revolt coinage.\nThe handles of Torah scrolls, when not in use, are sometimes covered with decorative silver globes similar in shape to pomegranates (\"Torah rimmonim\").\nConsuming pomegranates on Rosh Hashana, the Jewish New Year, is traditional because, with its numerous seeds, it symbolizes fruitfulness.\nTalmud and Kabbalah.\nThe pomegranate is said to have 613 seeds representing the 613 commandments of the Torah, but it is a misconception. There is no clear source for this claim, although it is used as a metaphor in the Talmud for numerous good deeds.\nIn European Christian motifs.\nIn the earliest incontrovertible appearance of Christ in a mosaic, a fourth-century floor mosaic from Hinton St Mary, Dorset, now in the British Museum, the bust of Christ and the chi rho are flanked by pomegranates.\nPomegranates continue to be a motif often found in Christian religious decoration. They are often woven into the fabric of vestments and liturgical hangings or wrought in metalwork. Pomegranates figure in many religious paintings by the likes of Sandro Botticelli and Leonardo da Vinci, often in the hands of the Virgin Mary or the infant Jesus. The fruit, broken or bursting open, is a symbol of the fullness of Jesus' suffering and resurrection.\nIn Islam.\nChapter 55 of the Quran mentions the pomegranate as a \"favour\" among many to be offered to those fearful to the \"Lord\" in \"two Gardens\".\nArmenia.\nThe pomegranate is one of the main fruits in Armenian culture (alongside apricots and grapes). Its juice is used with Armenian food and wine. The pomegranate is a symbol in Armenia, representing fertility, abundance, and marriage. It is also a semireligious icon. For example, the fruit played an integral role in a wedding custom widely practiced in ancient Armenia; a bride was given a pomegranate fruit, which she threw against a wall, breaking it into pieces. Scattered pomegranate seeds ensured the bride's future children.\n\"The Color of Pomegranates\", a movie directed by Sergei Parajanov, is a biography of the Armenian\" ashug\" Sayat-Nova (King of Song) which attempts to reveal the poet's life visually and poetically rather than literally.\nAzerbaijan.\nEvery fall the Goychay Pomegranate Festival is held in the city of Goychay.\nChina.\nIntroduced to China during the Han dynasty (206BC\u00a0\u2013 220AD), the pomegranate (), in older times, was considered an emblem of fertility and numerous progeny. Pictures of the ripe fruit with the seeds bursting forth were often hung in homes to bestow fertility and bless the dwelling with numerous offspring, an important facet of traditional Chinese culture.\nIn modern times, the pomegranate has been used to symbolise national cohesion and ethnic unity by General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party Xi Jinping, urging the Chinese population to \"stick together like pomegranate seeds\".\nIndia.\nIn some Hindu traditions, the pomegranate () symbolizes prosperity and fertility, and is associated with both Bhumi (the earth goddess) and Ganesha (the one fond of the many-seeded fruit).\nKurdish culture.\nThe pomegranate is an important fruit and symbol in Kurdish culture. It is accepted as a symbol of abundance and a sacred fruit of ancient Kurdish religions. Pomegranate is used as a symbol of abundance in Kurdish carpets.\nPalestinian culture.\nIn Palestinian culture, the pomegranate symbolizes fertility and is deeply embedded in folklore and traditions. A popular saying states, \"The pomegranate fills the heart with faith,\" and it is believed that every seed should be eaten, as one [pomegranate seed] may have come from paradise.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

She was the women's artistic individual all-around champion at the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow. She's the owner and head coach at Gemini Gymnastics, a gymnastics club in Oshawa, Ontario. In July 2012, Davydova was one of the coaches of the Canadian Women's Artistic Gymnastics Team. In 2016 Davydova was head floor judge at the 2016 Rio Olympics.\nIn October 2016, she was elected a member of the International Gymnastics Federation's Women Technical Committee.\nEarly life.\nDavydova was born in Voronezh, 500 kilometres south of Moscow, to Victor, a mechanic, and Tamara, an employee at the \"Leningrad Optical and Mechanical Works\". She became interested in gymnastics at age six after seeing on television the famous Soviet Olympic gold medallists Larisa Petrik and Natalia Kuchinskaya. She wanted to be enrolled in \"Spartak\" Gymnastics school, but was turned away for having the wrong physique.\nSoon a coach at the school, Gennadiy Korshunov, noticed her. He invited her into the school. He asked his wife, Ina, also a gymnastics coach at the school, to train Davydova in her group. Yuri Shtukman, the administrator at the school, did not like this initiative by his new training staff and reprimanded the Korshunovs; however he allowed Davydova to stay in the school. It soon became apparent that she was a talented gymnast and Gennadiy took over her coaching himself. By 1972 Davydova was the best in her age group at the school.\nDavydova has a brother, Yuri, who is 12 years her junior.\nGymnastics career.\nIn 1973, Davydova won her first international tournament. In 1974 she became a member of the USSR junior squad. At the 1975 USSR Junior Championships Davydova finished 3rd AA and won golds on vault and bars. Following her success here she became a member of the senior squad. In March 1976 Davydova achieved second place all-around at the USSR championships, in her first try as a senior. She also won the gold on bars and a silver on floor. At the inaugural American Cup, Davydova performed a side somersault on the beam, the first woman ever to do so. However, she only received third place AA. At the USSR Cup Davydova tied for sixth place AA \u2013 and won bronze on vault, only 0.025 behind world vault champion Olga Korbut \u2013 but only the top five and one gymnast in ninth place were chosen for the Soviet Olympic team.\nIn August, Davydova won the Antibes tournament in France. In addition, she won gold on the vault, and silvers on beam, bars, and floor. At the Riga International she scored the highest per-routine score in the competition (9.75 on vault), and won silver in the AA competition. She dominated event finals, winning three gold (beam, vault, bars) and a bronze on floor. In October, she was made a member of the USSR gymnastics display team, which visited the UK. She subsequently performed her beam routine on the \"Blue Peter\" show.\nIn December 1976, Davydova finished third AA at the Chunichi Cup in Japan, and won a gold on vault and a bronze on floor at the Tokyo Cup. She was the only woman in the competition to perform a front somersault vault. She also tied for first AA with Kische and Kraker of East Germany. In 1977 Davydova again won the gold medal on bars at the USSR Cup, scoring a perfect 10.\nIn September 1977 Davydova appeared on the front cover of a new magazine with an emphasis on young gymnasts, entitled \"Gymnastics World\". She was one of the four \"Mighty Mites\" featured in that issue. She was also a member of the USSR Display Team, along with Kim, Korbut, Grosdova, Filatova and Gorbik that performed in Great Britain.\nDavydova suffered a serious injury when a bone detached itself from her knee. The injury could have been a career-ender, but she recovered.\nIn 1978, Gennady Korshunov and his wife were invited to coach gymnastics in Leningrad. Davydova and her family moved along with the Korshunov family. She achieved a silver AA at the Spartakiade of Russian Federation Sports Schools meet, and bronze AA at the USSR Cup, being the top scorer on both beam and bars. Shortly after, Davydova won the AA title at the prestigious Chunichi Cup in Japan defeating Maxi Gnauck. Her win by 0.55 points remains the joint third-highest margin of victory in the competition's 34-year history. She also won gold on the bars and vault at the Tokyo Cup. As a result, she was chosen to be a member of the USSR team at the World Championships at Strasbourg in France. However, on the day of competition she was named as an alternate, and unable to compete.\nAt the 1979 Coca-Cola International in England, Davydova won a gold on floor and but lost gold on bars, after her coach blocked the line of vision of one of the judges, and she suffered the mandatory 0.3 deduction. She finished second AA at the Simo Sappien memorial tournament in Finland. Davydova was unable to attend the 1979 World Championships in Fort Worth, U.S., because of influenza. At the World University Games in Mexico she won team gold, bronze AA, and a silver medal on floor and bronze on vault.\nIn 1979 Olga Korbut named Davydova, Stella Zakharova, and Natalia Shaposhnikova as the three most promising young gymnasts.\n1980 Olympic Games.\nAt the 1980 \"Moscow News\" Tournament Davydova performed a full-on, full off vault. that had had only ever been done before by Olga Korbut. Davydova won a gold and 3 silver at the Moscow News Tournament. At the 1980 USSR Championships in April in Kiev Davydova won gold on vault- unveiling her unique vault full twist on, front somi off, scoring a 10 \u2013 and finished 3rd AA.\nThe Soviet Olympic gymnastics team was to be chosen after the USSR Cup competition. Davydova had finished joint 6th at the 1976 USSR Cup but that turned out to be insufficient to be placed on the team. Davydova won the all-around and scored a 10 on floor. Davydova subsequently was named to the Olympic team.\nAt the Olympics Davydova qualified for the all-around, vault and beam finals. The Soviet team won team gold and Davydova went on to win the all-around gold medal, and silver on the balance beam.\nPost-Olympics.\nOn 3 July 1981 in Montreux, the 100th anniversary celebration of the International Gymnastics Federation took place. Davydova was invited to perform her floor exercise. In August Davydova won the tournament in Giresum, Turkey. She won the AA title and was top scorer on vault, bars, floor and joint top scorer on beam. She scored 10's on bars and floor.\nAt the 1981 USSR Championships, Davydova won the All-Around title plus golds on floor and vault and bronze on bars. She also participated in the 1981 World Championships, her last major international event. The USSR won team gold. Davydova suffered a serious neck injury in pre-competition warm up but still finished 3rd all-around with a fall and was the only gymnast from any nation to make all 4 event finals. She won silver on floor and bronze on bars.\nDavydova remained on the Soviet display team until 1984 but retired from competitive gymnastics in late 1982. She was competing on vault at the Rome gymnastics Grand Prix in 82 when she injured her ankle. She didn't want to finish Elite competition gymnastics and talked of defending her Olympic title in L.A. but it became obvious as time went on that her body could no longer stand the pounding of intense workouts.\nAfter retirement.\nDavydova attended the \"Leningrad University of Physical education\" and later received her doctorate in Pedagogical science at the \"P.F. Lesgraft State Institute of Athletic Education\". The title of her thesis was \"Nontraditional preparation of top gymnasts for competitions.\"\nDavydova was part of the Saint Petersburg delegation that had bidden unsuccessfully to host the 2004 Olympic Games.\nOn 11 May 2007 Davydova was inducted into the International Gymnastics Hall of Fame (IGHOF).\nCoaching career.\nUpon graduation in 1987, Davydova began coaching and served as an international Brevet judge. She began her coaching career with the Leningrad Olympic reserve college and was a coach with the Soviet national gymnastics team.\nDavydova now owns Gemini Gymnastics, a high performance gymnastics club in Oshawa, Ontario where she has been a coach since immigrating to Canada, and Head Coach since 1999. Some of her better known gymnasts include Stephanie Capucitti, Sarah Deegan, Danielle Hicks, Katherine Fairhurst, Kristina Vaculik, Brittnee Habbib, Kelsey Hope and Ava Stewart. She was beam coach for the Canadian women's team at the 1995 World Championships and one of the Canadian women's team coaches at the 2002 Commonwealth Games. Davydova was twice named Gymnastics Canada Gymnastique coach of the year.\nIn October 2005 Davydova was chosen for the Coaching Association of Canada's Women in Coaching National Team Coaching Apprenticeship Program.\nIn 2005, 2006 and 2010 Gymnastics Canada Gymnastique awarded Davydova and long-time associate coach, Valery Yahchybekov, as the \"Junior High Performance Coaches of the Year\". Gemini Gymnastics has been recognised by GCG as Club of Excellence for 10 consecutive years since the inception of the awards in 2001. In 2006 Gemini received the prestigious Gymnastics Canada Ed Broughan award for \"Club of the Year\". As of 2012 Gemini have produced 15 Canadian AA champions,8 Elite Canada AA champions, 21 Eastern Canada AA champions, 98 Ontario provincial AA champions plus gymnasts who have won a host of other medals and awards. In 2012 Gemini was awarded a Club of Excellence award, 1 of only 4 recognised across Canada, and 1 of 2 to earn the highest gold level honour. In April 2012 Davydova was named Ontario's Coach of the Year.\nIn 2012, Kristina Vaculik, who was coached by Elena and Valery Yahchybekov at Gemini Gymnastics, was named to the Canadian Olympic team for the London 2012 Summer Olympic Games.\nDavydova coached Canadian gymnast Ava Stewart at the 2020 Summer Olympic Games in Tokyo.\nGymnastics Judge.\nDavydova became a gymnastics judge in 2005 and is the only Olympic all-around champion to do so.\nIn August, 2016, Davydova represented Canada as a judge at the 2016 Rio Olympics in Women's Artistic Gymnastics. She was named as head judge for the women's floor events at the Olympics.\nLegacy.\nDavydova advanced the difficulty of gymnastics, and is one of a select few to have introduced a new move and/or trend on each piece of apparatus. Davydova was the first female gymnast to perform an Arabian 1\u00be somersault, and a piked Arabian 1\u00be somersault on floor (both Arabian 1\u00be moves removed from the code of points for female gymnasts by the FIG in 1993 for safety reasons, effectively banned because of their danger and difficulty.\nEponymous skills.\nDavydova has two eponymous skills listed in the Code of Points.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nPersonal life.\nDavydova married boxing coach Pavel Filatov on 1 June 1983.

{"id": "74553", "revid": "8524693", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=74553", "title": "Dermatology", "text": "Field of medicine dealing with the hair, nails, skin, and its diseases\nDermatology is the branch of medicine dealing with the skin. It is a specialty with both medical and surgical aspects. A dermatologist is a specialist medical doctor who has undergone advanced training (typically 4 years beyond medical school) and manages diseases related to skin. Dermatological conditions, including inflammatory diseases, infections, cancers, hair loss, and cosmetic issues are common in the population, and sometimes difficult to diagnose or treat, requiring the services of a dermatologist. Dermatological interventions include systemic and topical medications, surgery, radiation, and physical modalities such as cryosurgery or laser therapy.\nEtymology.\nAttested in English in 1819, the word \"dermatology\" derives from the Greek \u03b4\u03ad\u03c1\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2 (\"dermatos\"), genitive of \u03b4\u03ad\u03c1\u03bc\u03b1 (\"derma\"), \"skin\" (itself from \u03b4\u03ad\u03c1\u03c9 \"dero\", \"to flay\") and -\u03bb\u03bf\u03b3\u03af\u03b1 \"-logia\". Neo-Latin \"dermatologia\" was coined in 1630, an anatomical term with various French and German uses attested from the 1730s.\nHistory.\nIn 1708, the first great school of dermatology became a reality at the famous H\u00f4pital Saint-Louis in Paris, and the first textbooks (Willan's, 1798\u20131808) and atlases (Alibert's, 1806\u20131816) appeared in print around the same time.\nUnited States.\nAfter earning a medical degree (M.D. or D.O.), the length of training in the United States for a general dermatologist to be eligible for board certification by the American Academy of Dermatology, American Board of Dermatology, or American Osteopathic Board of Dermatology is four years. This training consists of an initial medical, transitional, surgical, or pediatric intern year followed by a three-year dermatology residency. Following this training, one- or two-year post-residency fellowships are available in immunodermatology, phototherapy, laser medicine, Mohs micrographic surgery, cosmetic surgery, dermatopathology, or pediatric dermatology. While these dermatology fellowships offer additional subspecialty training, many dermatologists proficiently provide these services without subspecialty fellowship training. For the past several years, dermatology residency positions in the United States have been one of the most competitive to obtain.\nAccording to the American Academy of Dermatology, dermatologists are trained to diagnose and manage over 3,000 distinct skin, hair, and nail conditions across patients spanning various age groups.\nThe United States has been experiencing a national shortage of dermatologists for more than a decade. A study published by the \"Journal of the American Medical Association\" reported fewer than 3.4 dermatologists for every 100,000 people.\nUnited Kingdom.\nIn the UK, a dermatologist is a medically qualified practitioner who has gone on to specialise in medicine and then subspecialize in dermatology. This involves:\nUpon successful completion of the four-year training period, the doctor becomes an accredited dermatologist and is able to apply for a consultant hospital post as a consultant dermatologist.\nFields.\nCosmetic dermatology.\nDermatologists have been leaders in the field of cosmetic surgery. Some dermatologists complete fellowships in surgical dermatology. Many are trained in their residency on the use of botulinum toxin, fillers, and laser surgery. Some dermatologists perform cosmetic procedures including liposuction, blepharoplasty, and face lifts. Most dermatologists limit their cosmetic practice to minimally invasive procedures. Despite an absence of formal guidelines from the American Board of Dermatology, many cosmetic fellowships are offered in both surgery and laser medicine.\nDermatopathology.\nA dermatopathologist is a pathologist or dermatologist who specializes in the pathology of the skin. This field is shared by dermatologists and pathologists. Usually, a dermatologist or pathologist completes one year of dermatopathology fellowship and according to market projections, it is estimated to expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 11.4% from 2022 to 2030. This usually includes six months of general pathology and six months of dermatopathology. Alumni of both specialties can qualify as dermatopathologists. At the completion of a standard residency in dermatology, many dermatologists are also competent at dermatopathology. Some dermatopathologists qualify to sit for their examinations by completing a residency in dermatology and one in pathology.\nTrichology.\nTrichology specializes in diseases, which manifest with hair loss, hair abnormalities, hypertrichosis and scalp changes. Trichoscopy is a medical diagnostic method that is used by dermatologists with a special interest in trichology.\nImmunodermatology.\nThis field specializes in the treatment of immune-mediated skin diseases such as lupus, bullous pemphigoid, pemphigus vulgaris, and other immune-mediated skin disorders. Specialists in this field often run their own immunopathology labs. Immunodermatology testing is essential for the correct diagnosis and treatment of many diseases affecting epithelial organs including skin, mucous membranes, gastrointestinal and respiratory tracts. The various diseases often overlap in clinical and histological presentation and, although the diseases themselves are not common, may present with features of common skin disorders such as urticaria, eczema and chronic itch. Therefore, the diagnosis of an immunodermatological disease is often delayed. Tests are performed on blood and tissues that are sent to various laboratories from medical facilities and referring physicians across the United States.\nMohs surgery.\nThe dermatologic subspecialty called Mohs surgery focuses on the excision of skin cancers using a technique that allows intraoperative assessment of most of the peripheral and deep tumor margins. Developed in the 1930s by Frederic E. Mohs, the procedure is defined as a type of CCPDMA processing. Physicians trained in this technique must be comfortable with both pathology and surgery, and dermatologists receive extensive training in both during their residency. Physicians who perform Mohs surgery can receive training in this specialized technique during their dermatology residency, but many seek additional training either through formal preceptorships to become fellows of the American Society for Mohs Surgery or through one-year Mohs surgery fellowship training programs administered by the American College of Mohs Surgery. In 2020, the American Board of Dermatology (ABD) received approval from the American Board of Medical Specialties (ABMS) to establish a board-certification exam in the subspecialty of Micrographic Dermatologic Surgery (Mohs Surgery). The exam was first offered in October 2021 to any US board-certified dermatologist who practices Mohs surgery, regardless of whether they received their training in dermatology residency or as part of a fellowship.\nThis technique requires the integration of the same doctor in two different capacities - a surgeon and pathologist. In the case where either one is not available, a plastic surgeon can assist in Mohs surgery. However, plastic surgeons are not trained for this type of procedure, so a specialist is generally required.\nPediatric dermatology.\nPhysicians can qualify for this specialization by completing both a pediatric residency and a dermatology residency. Or they might elect to complete a post-residency fellowship. This field encompasses the complex diseases of the neonates, hereditary skin diseases or genodermatoses, and the many difficulties of working with the pediatric population. Another area pediatric dermatologists may focus on is treating acne. Acne is formed when follicles under the skin become clogged. This can be caused by sebum, an oil that keeps the skin moist, or dead skin cells clogging the pores. This is very common in teens and young adults, and can be treated by prescription from a dermatologist.\nTeledermatology.\nTeledermatology is a form of dermatological practice in which telecommunication technologies are used to exchange medical information and treatment through audio, visual, and data communication, including photos of dermatologic conditions, between dermatologists and nondermatologists who are evaluating patients, along with dermatologists directly with patients via distance. In India, during the severe coronavirus situations, some dermatologists have initiated online consultation with their patients using some of popular apps, such as Practo, Apollo Pharmacy, Skin Beauty Pal, Lybrate, etc. This subspecialty deals with options to view skin conditions over a large distance to provide knowledge exchange, to establish second-opinion services for experts, or to use this for follow-up of individuals with chronic skin conditions. Teledermatology can reduce wait times by allowing dermatologists to treat minor conditions online while serious conditions requiring immediate care are given priority for appointments.\nDermatoepidemiology.\nDermatoepidemiology is the study of skin disease at the population level. One of its aspects is the determination of the global burden of skin diseases.\nFrom 1990 to 2013, skin disease constituted about 2% of total global disease disability as measured in disability-adjusted life-years.\nComparative dermatology.\nComparative dermatology is a branch of dermatology that examines skin disorders across species, focusing on similarities and differences between humans and animals, such as dogs. This approach is needed for improving our understanding of dermatological conditions and developing more effective treatment and prevention strategies.\nSkin disorders are common in dogs, affecting their quality of life and often requiring veterinary intervention. While some breeds are genetically predisposed to specific skin issues, there remains a gap in research comparing these conditions to similar human skin disorders. This gap can give insights into the shared mechanisms underlying these diseases. For instance, atopic dermatitis. It is a common, itchy, and difficult-to-treat condition. By comparing the disease in animals and humans, researchers can gain information into its progression and variability in response to treatments.\nFurthermore, research into the genetic origin of skin disorders has demonstrated that certain genetic mutations in dogs are associated with inherited skin diseases, which may serve as models for understanding similar human conditions. Environmental factors, such as allergens and pollutants, also affects skin health. Studies published in journals focusing on inflammatory skin conditions in humans and veterinary research reveal how these environmental influences intersect with genetic predispositions, offering a comparative structure for further study.\nTreatment strategies for skin disorders also differ between veterinary and human medicine. Veterinary treatments often prioritize symptomatic relief and prevention, while human dermatological care may involve a broader range of targeted pharmaceutical options. Comparative analysis of these treatment methodologies could lead to the development of new therapies beneficial to both fields, as discussed in Microbiological Research into skin health.\nBy emphasizing the comparative aspects of dermatology, researchers can contribute to a deeper understanding of skin health across species. This field underscores the importance of genetic research, environmental studies, and treatment innovations, as evidenced by ongoing research in dermatological and veterinary science.\nTherapies.\nTherapies provided by dermatologists include:\nMost dermatologic pharmacology can be categorized based on the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) classification system, specifically the ATC code D.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "74554", "revid": "19655214", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=74554", "title": "Hardware description language", "text": "Specialized computer language used to describe electronic circuits\nIn computer engineering, a hardware description language (HDL) is a specialized computer language used to describe the structure and behavior of electronic circuits, usually to design application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) and to program field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs).\nA hardware description language enables a precise, formal description of an electronic circuit that allows for the automated analysis and simulation of the circuit. It also allows for the synthesis of an HDL description into a netlist (a specification of physical electronic components and how they are connected together), which can then be placed and routed to produce the set of masks used to create an integrated circuit.\nA hardware description language looks much like a programming language such as C or ALGOL; it is a textual description consisting of expressions, statements and control structures. One important difference between most programming languages and HDLs is that HDLs explicitly include the notion of time.\nHDLs form an integral part of electronic design automation (EDA) systems, especially for complex circuits, such as application-specific integrated circuits, microprocessors, and programmable logic devices.\nMotivation.\nDue to the exploding complexity of digital electronic circuits since the 1970s (see Moore's law), circuit designers needed digital logic descriptions to be performed at a high level without being tied to a specific electronic technology, such as ECL, TTL or CMOS. HDLs were created to implement register-transfer level abstraction, a model of the data flow and timing of a circuit.\nThere are two major hardware description languages: VHDL and Verilog. There are different types of description in them: \"dataflow, behavioral and structural\".\nExample of dataflow of VHDL:\nLIBRARY IEEE;\nUSE IEEE.STD_LOGIC_1164.ALL;\nENTITY not1 IS\n PORT(\n a : IN STD_LOGIC;\n b : OUT STD_LOGIC\nEND not1;\nARCHITECTURE behavioral OF not1 IS\nBEGIN\n b &lt;= NOT a;\nEND behavioral;\nStructure of HDL.\nHDLs are standard text-based expressions of the structure of electronic systems and their behaviour over time. Like concurrent programming languages, HDL syntax and semantics include explicit notations for expressing concurrency. However, in contrast to most software programming languages, HDLs also include an explicit notion of time, which is a primary attribute of hardware. Languages whose only characteristic is to express circuit connectivity between a hierarchy of blocks are properly classified as netlist languages used in electric computer-aided design. HDL can be used to express designs in structural, behavioral or register-transfer-level architectures for the same circuit functionality; in the latter two cases the synthesizer decides the architecture and logic gate layout.\nHDLs are used to write executable specifications for hardware. A program designed to implement the underlying semantics of the language statements and simulate the progress of time provides the hardware designer with the ability to model a piece of hardware before it is created physically. It is this executability that gives HDLs the illusion of being programming languages, when they are more precisely classified as specification languages or modeling languages. Simulators capable of supporting discrete-event (digital) and continuous-time (analog) modeling exist, and HDLs targeted for each are available.\nComparison with control-flow languages.\nIt is certainly possible to represent hardware semantics using traditional programming languages such as C++, which operate on control flow semantics as opposed to data flow, although to function as such, programs must be augmented with extensive and unwieldy class libraries. Generally, however, software programming languages do not include any capability for explicitly expressing time, and thus cannot function as hardware description languages. Before the introduction of System Verilog in 2002, C++ integration with a logic simulator was one of the few ways to use object-oriented programming in hardware verification. System Verilog is the first major HDL to offer object orientation and garbage collection.\nUsing the proper subset of hardware description language, a program called a synthesizer, or logic synthesis tool, can infer hardware logic operations from the language statements and produce an equivalent netlist of generic hardware primitives to implement the specified behaviour. Synthesizers generally ignore the expression of any timing constructs in the text. Digital logic synthesizers, for example, generally use clock edges as the way to time the circuit, ignoring any timing constructs. The ability to have a synthesizable subset of the language does not itself make a hardware description language.\nHistory.\nThe first hardware description languages appeared in the late 1960s, looking like more traditional languages. The first that had a lasting effect was described in 1971 in C. Gordon Bell and Allen Newell's text \"Computer Structures\". This text introduced the concept of register transfer level, first used in the ISP language to describe the behavior of the Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) PDP-8.\nThe language became more widespread with the introduction of DEC's PDP-16 RT-Level Modules (RTMs) and a book describing their use.\nAt least two implementations of the basic ISP language (ISPL and ISPS) followed.\nISPS was well suited to describe relations between the inputs and the outputs of the design and was quickly adopted by commercial teams at DEC, and by several research teams in the US and among its allies in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).\nThe RTM products never succeeded commercially and DEC stopped marketing them in the mid-1980s, as new methods grew more popular, more so very-large-scale integration (VLSI).\nSeparate work done about 1979 at the University of Kaiserslautern produced a language called KARL (\"KAiserslautern Register Transfer Language\"), which included design calculus language features supporting VLSI chip floorplanning and structured hardware design. This work was also the basis of KARL's interactive graphic sister language ABL, whose name was an initialism for \"a block diagram language\". ABL was implemented in the early 1980s by the Centro Studi e Laboratori Telecomunicazioni (CSELT) in Torino, Italy, producing the ABLED graphic VLSI design editor. In the mid-1980s, a VLSI design framework was implemented around KARL and ABL by an international consortium funded by the Commission of the European Union.\nBy the late 1970s, design using programmable logic devices (PLDs) became popular, although these designs were primarily limited to designing finite-state machines. The work at Data General in 1980 used these same devices to design the Data General Eclipse MV/8000, and commercial need began to grow for a language that could map well to them. By 1983 Data I/O introduced ABEL to fill that need.\nIn 1985, as design shifted to VLSI, Gateway Design Automation introduced Verilog, and Intermetrics released the first completed version of the VHSIC Hardware Description Language (VHDL). VHDL was developed at the behest of the United States Department of Defense's Very High Speed Integrated Circuit Program (VHSIC), and was based on the Ada programming language, and on the experience gained with the earlier development of ISPS. Initially, Verilog and VHDL were used to document and simulate circuit designs already captured and described in another form (such as schematic files). HDL simulation enabled engineers to work at a higher level of abstraction than simulation at the schematic level, and thus increased design capacity from hundreds of transistors to thousands. In 1986, with the support of the U.S Department of Defense, VHDL was sponsored as an IEEE standard (IEEE Std 1076), and the first IEEE-standardized version of VHDL, IEEE Std 1076-1987, was approved in December 1987. Cadence Design Systems later acquired Gateway Design Automation for the rights to Verilog-XL, the HDL simulator that would become the de facto standard of Verilog simulators for the next decade.\nThe introduction of logic synthesis for HDLs pushed HDLs from the background into the foreground of digital design. Synthesis tools compiled HDL source files (written in a constrained format called RTL) into a manufacturable netlist description in terms of gates and transistors. Writing synthesizable RTL files required practice and discipline on the part of the designer; compared to a traditional schematic layout, synthesized RTL netlists were almost always larger in area and slower in performance. A circuit design from a skilled engineer, using labor-intensive schematic-capture/hand-layout, would almost always outperform its logically-synthesized equivalent, but the productivity advantage held by synthesis soon displaced digital schematic capture to exactly those areas that were problematic for RTL synthesis: extremely high-speed, low-power, or asynchronous circuitry.\nWithin a few years, VHDL and Verilog emerged as the dominant HDLs in the electronics industry, while older and less capable HDLs gradually disappeared from use. However, VHDL and Verilog share many of the same limitations, such as being unsuitable for analog or mixed-signal circuit simulation. Specialized HDLs (such as Confluence) were introduced with the explicit goal of fixing specific limitations of Verilog and VHDL, though none were ever intended to replace them.\nOver the years, much effort has been invested in improving HDLs. The latest iteration of Verilog, formally known as IEEE 1800-2005 SystemVerilog, introduces many new features (classes, random variables, and properties/assertions) to address the growing need for better test bench randomization, design hierarchy, and reuse. A future revision of VHDL is also in development, and is expected to match SystemVerilog's improvements.\nDesign using HDL.\nAs a result of the efficiency gains realized using HDL, a majority of modern digital circuit design revolves around it. Most designs begin as a set of requirements or a high-level architectural diagram. Control and decision structures are often prototyped in flowchart applications, or entered in a editor. The process of writing the HDL description is highly dependent on the nature of the circuit and the designer's preference for coding style. The HDL is merely the 'capture language', often beginning with a high-level algorithmic description such as a C++ mathematical model. Designers often use scripting languages such as Perl to automatically generate repetitive circuit structures in the HDL language. Special text editors offer features for automatic indentation, syntax-dependent coloration, and macro-based expansion of the entity/architecture/signal declaration.\nThe HDL code then undergoes a code review, or auditing. In preparation for synthesis, the HDL description is subject to an array of automated checkers. The checkers report deviations from standardized code guidelines, identify potential ambiguous code constructs before they can cause misinterpretation, and check for common logical coding errors, such as floating ports or shorted outputs. This process aids in resolving errors before the code is synthesized.\nIn industry parlance, HDL design generally ends at the synthesis stage. Once the synthesis tool has mapped the HDL description into a gate netlist, the netlist is passed off to the back-end stage. Depending on the physical technology (FPGA, ASIC gate array, ASIC standard cell), HDLs may or may not play a significant role in the back-end flow. In general, as the design flow progresses toward a physically realizable form, the design database becomes progressively more laden with technology-specific information, which cannot be stored in a generic HDL description. Finally, an integrated circuit is manufactured or programmed for use.\nSimulating and debugging HDL code.\nEssential to HDL design is the ability to simulate HDL programs. Simulation allows an HDL description of a design (called a model) to pass design verification, an important milestone that validates the design's intended function (specification) against the code implementation in the HDL description. It also permits architectural exploration. The engineer can experiment with design choices by writing multiple variations of a base design, then comparing their behavior in simulation. Thus, simulation is critical for successful HDL design.\nTo simulate an HDL model, an engineer writes a top-level simulation environment (called a test bench). At minimum, a testbench contains an instantiation of the model (called the device under test or DUT), pin/signal declarations for the model's I/O, and a clock waveform. The testbench code is event driven: the engineer writes HDL statements to implement the (testbench-generated) reset-signal, to model interface transactions (such as a host\u2013bus read/write), and to monitor the DUT's output. An HDL simulator \u2014 the program that executes the testbench \u2014 maintains the simulator clock, which is the master reference for all events in the testbench simulation. Events occur only at the instants dictated by the testbench HDL (such as a reset-toggle coded into the testbench), or in reaction (by the model) to stimulus and triggering events. Modern HDL simulators have full-featured graphical user interfaces, complete with a suite of debug tools. These allow the user to stop and restart the simulation at any time, insert simulator breakpoints (independent of the HDL code), and monitor or modify any element in the HDL model hierarchy. Modern simulators can also link the HDL environment to user-compiled libraries, through a defined PLI/VHPI interface. Linking is system-dependent (x86, SPARC etc. running Windows/Linux/Solaris), as the HDL simulator and user libraries are compiled and linked outside the HDL environment.\nDesign verification is often the most time-consuming portion of the design process, due to the disconnect between a device's functional specification, the designer's interpretation of the specification, and the imprecision of the HDL language. The majority of the initial test/debug cycle is conducted in the HDL \"simulator\" environment, as the early stage of the design is subject to frequent and major circuit changes. An HDL description can also be prototyped and tested in hardware \u2014 programmable logic devices are often used for this purpose. Hardware prototyping is comparatively more expensive than HDL simulation, but offers a real-world view of the design. Prototyping is the best way to check interfacing against other hardware devices and hardware prototypes. Even those running on slow FPGAs offer much shorter simulation times than pure HDL simulation.\nDesign verification with HDLs.\nHistorically, design verification was a laborious, repetitive loop of writing and running simulation test cases against the design under test. As chip designs have grown larger and more complex, the task of design verification has grown to the point where it now dominates the schedule of a design team. Looking for ways to improve design productivity, the electronic design automation industry developed the Property Specification Language.\nIn formal verification terms, a property is a factual statement about the expected or assumed behavior of another object. Ideally, for a given HDL description, a property or properties can be proven true or false using formal mathematical methods. In practical terms, many properties cannot be proven because they occupy an unbounded solution space. However, if provided a set of operating assumptions or constraints, a property checker can prove (or disprove) certain properties by narrowing the solution space.\nThe assertions do not model circuit activity, but capture and document the designer's intent in the HDL code. In a simulation environment, the simulator evaluates all specified assertions, reporting the location and severity of any violations. In a synthesis environment, the synthesis tool usually operates with the policy of halting synthesis upon any violation. Assertion based verification is still in its infancy, but is expected to become an integral part of the HDL design toolset.\nHDL and programming languages.\nAn HDL is grossly similar to a software programming language, but there are major differences. Most programming languages are inherently procedural (single-threaded), with limited syntactical and semantic support to handle concurrency. HDLs, on the other hand, resemble concurrent programming languages in their ability to model multiple parallel processes (such as flip-flops and adders) that automatically execute independently of one another. Any change to the process's input automatically triggers an update in the simulator's process stack.\nBoth programming languages and HDLs are processed by a compiler (often called a synthesizer in the HDL case), but with different goals. For HDLs, \"compiling\" refers to logic synthesis; the process of transforming the HDL code listing into a physically realizable gate netlist. The netlist output can take any of many forms: a \"simulation\" netlist with gate-delay information, a \"handoff\" netlist for post-synthesis placement and routing on a semiconductor die, or a generic industry-standard Electronic Design Interchange Format (EDIF) (for subsequent conversion to a JEDEC-format file).\nOn the other hand, a software compiler converts the source-code listing into a microprocessor-specific object code for execution on the target microprocessor. As HDLs and programming languages borrow concepts and features from each other, the boundary between them is becoming less distinct. However, pure HDLs are unsuitable for general purpose application software development, just as general-purpose programming languages are undesirable for modeling hardware.\nYet as electronic systems grow increasingly complex, and reconfigurable systems become increasingly common, there is growing desire in the industry for a single language that can perform some tasks of both hardware design and software programming. SystemC is an example of such\u2014embedded system hardware can be modeled as non-detailed architectural blocks (black boxes with modeled signal inputs and output drivers). The target application is written in C or C++ and natively compiled for the host-development system; as opposed to targeting the embedded CPU, which requires host-simulation of the embedded CPU or an emulated CPU.\nThe high level of abstraction of SystemC models is well suited to early architecture exploration, as architectural modifications can be easily evaluated with little concern for signal-level implementation issues. However, the threading model used in SystemC relies on shared memory, causing the language not to handle parallel execution or low-level models well.\nHigh-level synthesis.\nIn their level of abstraction, HDLs have been compared to assembly languages. There are attempts to raise the abstraction level of hardware design in order to reduce the complexity of programming in HDLs, creating a sub-field called \"high-level synthesis\".\nCompanies such as Cadence, Synopsys and Agility Design Solutions are promoting SystemC as a way to combine high-level languages with concurrency models to allow faster design cycles for FPGAs than is possible using traditional HDLs. Approaches based on standard C or C++ (with libraries or other extensions allowing parallel programming) are found in the Catapult C tools from Mentor Graphics, and the Impulse C tools from Impulse Accelerated Technologies.\nA similar initiative from Intel is the use of Data Parallel C++, related to SYCL, as a high-level synthesis language.\nhttps://, Inc.'s CoreFire Design Suite and National Instruments LabVIEW FPGA provide a graphical dataflow approach to high-level design entry and languages such as SystemVerilog, SystemVHDL, and Handel-C seek to accomplish the same goal, but are aimed at making existing hardware engineers more productive, rather than making FPGAs more accessible to existing software engineers.\nIt is also possible to design hardware modules using MATLAB and Simulink using the MathWorks HDL Coder tool or DSP Builder for Intel FPGAs or Xilinx System Generator (XSG) from Xilinx.\nExamples of HDLs.\nHDLs for digital circuit design.\nThe two most widely used and well-supported HDL varieties used in industry are Verilog and VHDL.\nHDLs for printed circuit board design.\nSeveral projects exist for defining printed circuit board connectivity using language based, textual-entry methods. Among these, new approaches have emerged that focus on enhancing readability, reusability, and validation. These modern methodologies employ open-source design languages specifically tailored for electronics, adopting declarative markup to specify what circuits should achieve. This shift integrates software development principles into hardware design, streamlining the process and emphasizing automation, reuse, and validation.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Typical features of the condition include blackheads or whiteheads, pimples, oily skin, and possible scarring. It primarily affects skin with a relatively high number of oil glands, including the face, upper part of the chest, and back. The resulting appearance can lead to lack of confidence, anxiety, reduced self-esteem, and, in extreme cases, depression or thoughts of suicide.\nSusceptibility to acne is primarily genetic in 80% of cases. The roles of diet and cigarette smoking in the condition are unclear, and neither cleanliness nor exposure to sunlight are associated with acne. In both sexes, hormones called androgens appear to be part of the underlying mechanism, by causing increased production of sebum. Another common factor is the excessive growth of the bacterium \"Cutibacterium acnes\", which is present on the skin.\nTreatments for acne are available, including lifestyle changes, medications, and medical procedures. Eating fewer simple carbohydrates such as sugar may minimize the condition. Treatments applied directly to the affected skin, such as azelaic acid, benzoyl peroxide, and salicylic acid, are commonly used. Antibiotics and retinoids are available in formulations that are applied to the skin and taken by mouth for the treatment of acne. However, resistance to antibiotics may develop as a result of antibiotic therapy. Several types of birth control pills help prevent acne in women. Medical professionals typically reserve isotretinoin pills for severe acne, due to greater potential side effects. Early and aggressive treatment of acne is advocated by some in the medical community to decrease the overall long-term impact on individuals.\nIn 2015, acne affected approximately 633million people globally, making it the eighth-most common disease worldwide. Acne commonly occurs in adolescence and affects an estimated 80\u201390% of teenagers in the Western world. Some rural societies report lower rates of acne than industrialized ones. Children and adults may also be affected before and after puberty. Although acne becomes less common in adulthood, it persists in nearly half of affected people into their twenties and thirties, and a smaller group continues to have difficulties in their forties.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nClassification.\nThere are six main types of acne: blackheads, whiteheads, papules, pustules, nodules, and cysts.\nThe severity of acne vulgaris (Gr. \u1f00\u03ba\u03bc\u03ae, \"point\" + L. \"vulgaris\", \"common\") can be classified as mild, moderate, or severe to determine an appropriate treatment regimen. There is no universally accepted scale for grading acne severity. The presence of clogged skin follicles (known as comedones) limited to the face with occasional inflammatory lesions defines mild acne. Moderate severity acne is said to occur when a higher number of inflammatory papules and pustules occur on the face, compared to mild cases of acne, and appear on the trunk of the body. Severe acne is said to occur when nodules (the painful 'bumps' lying under the skin) are the characteristic facial lesions, and involvement of the trunk is extensive.\nThe lesions are usually polymorphic, meaning they can take many forms, including open or closed comedones (commonly known as blackheads and whiteheads), papules, pustules, and even nodules or cysts so that these lesions often leave behind sequelae, or abnormal conditions resulting from a previous disease, such as scarring or hyperpigmentation.\nLarge nodules were previously called cysts. The term \"nodulocystic\" has been used in the medical literature to describe severe cases of inflammatory acne. True cysts are rare in those with acne, and the term \"severe nodular acne\" is now the preferred terminology.\n\"Acne inversa\" (L. invert\u014d, \"upside-down\") and \"acne rosacea\" (rosa, \"rose-colored\" + -\u0101ceus, \"forming\") are not forms of acne and are alternate names that respectively refer to the skin conditions hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) and rosacea. Although HS shares certain overlapping features with acne vulgaris, such as a tendency to clog skin follicles with skin cell debris, the condition otherwise lacks the hallmark features of acne and is therefore considered a distinct skin disorder.\nSigns and symptoms.\nTypical features of acne include increased secretion of oily sebum by the skin, microcomedones, comedones, papules, nodules (large papules), pustules, and often results in scarring. The appearance of acne varies with skin color. It may result in psychological and social problems.\nScars.\nAcne scars are caused by inflammation within the dermis and are estimated to affect 95% of people with acne vulgaris. Abnormal healing and dermal inflammation create the scar. Scarring is most likely to take place with severe acne but may occur with any form of acne vulgaris. Acne scars are classified based on whether the abnormal healing response following dermal inflammation leads to excess collagen deposition or loss at the site of the acne lesion.\nAtrophic acne scars have lost collagen from the healing response and are the most common type of acne scar (accounting for approximately 75% of all acne scars). Ice-pick scars, boxcar scars, and rolling scars are subtypes of atrophic acne scars. Boxcar scars are round or ovoid indented scars with sharp borders and vary in size from 1.5\u20134\u00a0mm across. Ice-pick scars are narrow (less than 2\u00a0mm across), deep scars that extend into the dermis. Rolling scars are broader than ice-pick and boxcar scars (4\u20135\u00a0mm across) and have a wave-like pattern of depth in the skin.\nHypertrophic scars are uncommon and are characterized by increased collagen content after the abnormal healing response. They are described as firm and raised from the skin. Hypertrophic scars remain within the original margins of the wound, whereas keloid scars can form scar tissue outside of these borders. Keloid scars from acne occur more often in men and people with darker skin, and usually occur on the trunk of the body.\nPigmentation.\nAfter an inflamed nodular acne lesion resolves, it is common for the skin to darken in that area, which is known as postinflammatory hyperpigmentation (PIH). The inflammation stimulates specialized pigment-producing skin cells (known as melanocytes) to produce more melanin pigment, which leads to the skin's darkened appearance. PIH occurs more frequently in people with darker skin color. Pigmented scar is a common term used for PIH, but is misleading as it suggests the color change is permanent. Often, PIH can be prevented by avoiding any aggravation of the nodule and can fade with time. However, untreated PIH can last for months, years, or even be permanent if deeper layers of skin are affected. Even minimal skin exposure to the sun's ultraviolet rays can sustain hyperpigmentation. Daily use of SPF\u00a015 or higher sunscreen can minimize such a risk. Whitening agents like azelaic acid, arbutin or else may be used to improve hyperpigmentation.\nCauses.\nRisk factors for the development of acne, other than genetics, have not been conclusively identified. Possible secondary contributors include hormones, infections, diet, and stress. Studies investigating the impact of smoking on the incidence and severity of acne have been inconclusive. Cleanliness (hygiene) and sunlight are not associated with acne.\nGenes.\nAcne appears to be highly heritable; genetics explain 81% of the variation in the population. Studies performed in affected twins and first-degree relatives further demonstrate the strongly inherited nature of acne. Acne susceptibility is likely due to the influence of multiple genes, as the disease does not follow a classic (Mendelian) inheritance pattern. These gene candidates include certain variations in tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), IL-1 alpha, and CYP1A1 genes, among others. The 308\u00a0G/A single nucleotide polymorphism variation in the gene for TNF is associated with an increased risk for acne. Acne can be a feature of rare genetic disorders such as Apert's syndrome. Severe acne may be associated with XYY syndrome.\nHormones.\nHormonal activity, such as occurs during menstrual cycles and puberty, may contribute to the formation of acne. During puberty, an increase in sex hormones called androgens causes the skin follicle glands to grow larger and make more oily sebum. The androgen hormones testosterone, dihydrotestosterone (DHT), and dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) are all linked to acne. High levels of growth hormone (GH) and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) are also associated with worsened acne. Both androgens and IGF-1 seem to be essential for acne to occur, as acne does not develop in individuals with complete androgen insensitivity syndrome (CAIS) or Laron syndrome (insensitivity to GH, resulting in very low IGF-1 levels).\nMedical conditions that commonly cause a high-androgen state, such as polycystic ovary syndrome, congenital adrenal hyperplasia, and androgen-secreting tumors, can cause acne in affected individuals. Conversely, people who lack androgenic hormones or are insensitive to the effects of androgens rarely have acne. Pregnancy can increase androgen levels, and consequently, oily sebum synthesis. Acne can be a side effect of testosterone replacement therapy or anabolic steroid use. Over-the-counter bodybuilding and dietary supplements often contain illegally added anabolic steroids.\nInfections.\nThe anaerobic bacterial species \"Cutibacterium acnes\" (formerly \"Propionibacterium acnes\") contributes to the development of acne, but its exact role is not well understood. There are specific sub-strains of \"C. acnes\" associated with normal skin and others with moderate or severe inflammatory acne. It is unclear whether these undesirable strains evolve on-site or are acquired, or possibly both depending on the person. These strains have the capability of changing, perpetuating, or adapting to the abnormal cycle of inflammation, oil production, and inadequate sloughing of dead skin cells from acne pores. Some studies have explored a possible link between Demodex mites and acne, though findings remain inconclusive. It is unclear whether eradication of the mite improves acne.\nDiet.\nHigh-glycemic-load diets have been found to have different degrees of effect on acne severity. Multiple randomized controlled trials and nonrandomized studies have found a lower-glycemic-load diet to be effective in reducing acne. There is weak observational evidence suggesting that dairy milk consumption is positively associated with a higher frequency and severity of acne. Milk contains whey protein and hormones such as bovine IGF-1 and precursors of dihydrotestosterone. Studies suggest these components promote the effects of insulin and IGF-1 and thereby increase the production of androgen hormones, sebum, and promote the formation of comedones. Available evidence does not support a link between eating chocolate or salt and acne severity. Few studies have examined the relationship between obesity and acne. Vitamin B12 may trigger skin outbreaks similar to acne (acneiform eruptions), or worsen existing acne when taken in doses exceeding the recommended daily intake.\nStress.\nThere are few high-quality studies to demonstrate that stress causes or worsens acne. Despite being controversial, some research indicates that increased acne severity is associated with high stress levels in certain contexts, such as hormonal changes seen in premenstrual syndrome.\nOther.\nSome individuals experience severe intensification of their acne when they are exposed to hot humid climates; this is due to bacteria and fungus thriving in warm, moist environments. This climate-induced acne exacerbation has been termed tropical acne.\nMechanical obstruction of skin follicles with helmets or chinstraps can worsen pre-existing acne. However, acne caused by mechanical obstruction is technically not acne vulgaris, but another acneiform eruption known as acne mechanica.\nSeveral medications can also worsen pre-existing acne; this condition is the acne medicamentosa form of acne. Examples of such medications include lithium, hydantoin, isoniazid, glucocorticoids, iodides, bromides, and testosterone. When acne medicamentosa is specifically caused by anabolic\u2013androgenic steroids it can simply be referred to as steroid acne.\nGenetically susceptible individuals can get acne breakouts as a result of polymorphous light eruption; a condition triggered by sunlight and artificial UV light exposure. This form of acne is called Acne aestivalis and is specifically caused by intense UVA light exposure. Affected individuals usually experience seasonal acne breakouts on their upper arms, shoulder girdle, back, and chest. The breakouts typically occur one-to-three days after exposure to intese UVA radiation. Unlike other forms of acne, the condition spares the face; this could possibly be a result of the pathogenesis of polymorphous light eruption, in which areas of the skin that are \"newly\" exposed to intense ultraviolet radiation are affected. Since faces are typically left uncovered at all stages of life, there is little-to-no likelihood for an eruption to appear there. Studies show that both polymorphous light eruption outbreaks and the acne aestivalis breakout response can be prevented by topical antioxidants combined with the application of a broad spectrum sunscreen.\nPathophysiology.\nAcne vulgaris is a chronic skin disease of the pilosebaceous unit and develops due to blockages in the skin's hair follicles.\nTraditionally seen as a disease of adolescence, acne vulgaris is also observed in adults, including post-menopausal women. Acne vulgaris manifested in adult female is called \"adult female acne\" (AFA), defined as a chronic inflammatory disease of the pilosebaceous unit. Particularly in AFA, during the menopausal transition, a relative increase in androgen levels occurs as estrogen levels begin to decline, so that this hormonal shift can manifest as acne; while most women with AFA exhibit few acne lesions and have normal androgen levels, baseline investigations, including an androgen testing panel, can help rule out associated comorbidities such as polycystic ovarian syndrome, congenital adrenal hyperplasia, or tumors.\nThe blockages in the skin's hair follicles that cause acne vulgaris manifestations occur as a result of the following four abnormal processes: increased oily sebum production (influenced by androgens), excessive deposition of the protein keratin leading to comedo formation, colonization of the follicle by \"Cutibacterium acnes\" (\"C. acnes\") bacteria, and the local release of pro-inflammatory chemicals in the skin.\nThe earliest pathologic change is the formation of a plug (a microcomedone), which is driven primarily by excessive growth, reproduction, and accumulation of skin cells in the hair follicle. In healthy skin, the skin cells that have died come up to the surface and exit the pore of the hair follicle. In people with acne, the increased production of oily sebum causes the dead skin cells to stick together. The accumulation of dead skin cell debris and oily sebum blocks the pore of the hair follicle, thus forming the microcomedone. The \"C. acnes\" biofilm within the hair follicle worsens this process. If the microcomedone is superficial within the hair follicle, the skin pigment melanin is exposed to air, resulting in its oxidation and dark appearance (known as a blackhead or open comedo). In contrast, if the microcomedone occurs deep within the hair follicle, this causes the formation of a whitehead (known as a closed comedo).\nThe main hormonal driver of oily sebum production in the skin is dihydrotestosterone. Another androgenic hormone responsible for increased sebaceous gland activity is DHEA-S. The adrenal glands secrete higher amounts of DHEA-S during adrenarche (a stage of puberty), and this leads to an increase in sebum production. In a sebum-rich skin environment, the naturally occurring and largely commensal skin bacterium \"C. acnes\" readily grows and can cause inflammation within and around the follicle due to activation of the innate immune system. \"C. acnes\" triggers skin inflammation in acne by increasing the production of several pro-inflammatory chemical signals (such as IL-1\u03b1, IL-8, TNF-\u03b1, and LTB4); IL-1\u03b1 is essential to comedo formation.\n\"C. acnes\"' ability to bind and activate a class of immune system receptors known as toll-like receptors (TLRs), especially TLR2 and TLR4, is a core mechanism of acne-related skin inflammation. Activation of TLR2 and TLR4 by \"C. acnes\" leads to increased secretion of IL-1\u03b1, IL-8, and TNF-\u03b1. The release of these inflammatory signals attracts various immune cells to the hair follicle, including neutrophils, macrophages, and Th1 cells. IL-1\u03b1 stimulates increased skin cell activity and reproduction, which, in turn, fuels comedo development. Furthermore, sebaceous gland cells produce more antimicrobial peptides, such as HBD1 and HBD2, in response to the binding of TLR2 and TLR4.\n\"C. acnes\" also provokes skin inflammation by altering the fatty composition of oily sebum. Oxidation of the lipid squalene by \"C. acnes\" is of particular importance. Squalene oxidation activates NF-\u03baB (a protein complex) and consequently increases IL-1\u03b1 levels. Additionally, squalene oxidation increases 5-lipoxygenase enzyme activity, which catalyzes the conversion of arachidonic acid to leukotriene B4 (LTB4). LTB4 promotes skin inflammation by acting on the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPAR\u03b1) protein. PPAR\u03b1 increases the activity of activator protein 1 (AP-1) and NF-\u03baB, thereby leading to the recruitment of inflammatory T cells. \"C. acnes\"' ability to convert sebum triglycerides to pro-inflammatory free fatty acids via secretion of the enzyme lipase further explains its inflammatory properties. These free fatty acids spur increased production of cathelicidin, HBD1, and HBD2, thus leading to further inflammation.\nThis inflammatory cascade typically leads to the formation of inflammatory acne lesions, including papules, infected pustules, or nodules. If the inflammatory reaction is severe, the follicle can break into the deeper layers of the dermis and subcutaneous tissue and cause the formation of deep nodules. The involvement of AP-1 in the aforementioned inflammatory cascade activates matrix metalloproteinases, which contribute to local tissue destruction and scar formation.\nAlong with the bacteria \"C. acnes\", the bacterial species \"Staphylococcus epidermidis\" (\"S. epidermidis\") also takes a part in the physiopathology of acne vulgaris. The proliferation of \"S. epidermidis\" with \"C. acnes\" causes the formation of biofilms, which blocks the hair follicles and pores, creating an anaerobic environment under the skin. This enables for increased growth of both \"C. acnes\" and \"S. epidermidis\" under the skin. The proliferation of \"C. acnes\" causes the formation of biofilms and a biofilm matrix, making it even harder to treat the acne.\nDiagnosis.\nAcne vulgaris is diagnosed based on a medical professional's clinical judgment. The evaluation of a person with suspected acne should include taking a detailed medical history about a family history of acne, a review of medications taken, signs or symptoms of excessive production of androgen hormones, cortisol, and growth hormone. Comedones (blackheads and whiteheads) must be present to diagnose acne. In their absence, an appearance similar to that of acne would suggest a different skin disorder. Microcomedones (the precursor to blackheads and whiteheads) are not visible to the naked eye when inspecting the skin and require a microscope to be seen. Many features may indicate that a person's acne vulgaris is sensitive to hormonal influences. Historical and physical clues that may suggest hormone-sensitive acne include onset between ages 20 and 30; worsening the week before a woman's period; acne lesions predominantly over the jawline and chin; and inflammatory/nodular acne lesions.\nSeveral scales exist to grade the severity of acne vulgaris, but disagreement persists about the ideal one for diagnostic use. Cook's acne grading scale uses photographs to grade severity from 0 to 8, with higher numbers representing more severe acne. This scale was the first to use a standardized photographic protocol to assess acne severity; since its creation in 1979, the scale has undergone several revisions. The Leeds acne grading technique counts acne lesions on the face, back, and chest and categorizes them as inflammatory or non-inflammatory. Leeds scores range from 0 (least severe) to 10 (most severe) though modified scales have a maximum score of 12. The Pillsbury acne grading scale classifies the severity of the acne from grade 1 (least severe) to grade 4 (most severe).\nDifferential diagnosis.\nMany skin conditions can mimic acne vulgaris, and these are collectively known as acneiform eruptions. Such conditions include angiofibromas, epidermal cysts, flat warts, folliculitis, keratosis pilaris, milia, perioral dermatitis, and rosacea, among others. Age is one factor that may help distinguish between these disorders. Skin disorders such as perioral dermatitis and keratosis pilaris can appear similar to acne but tend to occur more frequently in childhood. Rosacea tends to occur more frequently in older adults. Facial redness triggered by heat or the consumption of alcohol or spicy food is also more suggestive of rosacea. The presence of comedones helps health professionals differentiate acne from skin disorders that are similar in appearance. Chloracne and occupational acne due to exposure to certain chemicals &amp; industrial compounds, may look very similar to acne vulgaris.\nManagement.\nMany different treatments exist for acne. These include alpha hydroxy acid, anti-androgen medications, antibiotics, antiseborrheic medications, azelaic acid, benzoyl peroxide, hormonal treatments, keratolytic soaps, nicotinamide (niacinamide), retinoids, and salicylic acid. Acne treatments work in at least four different ways, including the following: reducing inflammation, hormonal manipulation, killing \"C. acnes\", and normalizing skin cell shedding and sebum production in the pore to prevent blockage. Typical treatments include topical therapies such as antibiotics, benzoyl peroxide, and retinoids, and systemic therapies, including antibiotics, hormonal agents, and oral retinoids.\nRecommended therapies for first-line use in acne vulgaris treatment include topical retinoids, benzoyl peroxide, and topical or oral antibiotics. Procedures such as light therapy and laser therapy are not first-line treatments and typically have only an add on role due to their high cost and limited evidence. Blue light therapy is of unclear benefit. Medications for acne target the early stages of comedo formation and are generally ineffective for visible skin lesions; acne generally improves between eight and twelve weeks after starting therapy.\nPeople often view acne as a short-term condition, some expecting it to disappear after puberty. This misconception can lead to depending on self-management or problems with long-term adherence to treatment. Communicating the long-term nature of the condition and better access to reliable information about acne can help people know what to expect from treatments.\nSkin care.\nIn general, it is recommended that people with acne do not wash affected skin more than twice daily. The application of a fragrance-free moisturizer to sensitive and acne-prone skin may reduce irritation. Skin irritation from acne medications typically peaks at two weeks after onset of use and tends to improve with continued use. Dermatologists recommend using cosmetic products that specifically say non-comedogenic, oil-free, and will not clog pores.\nAcne vulgaris patients, even those with oily skin, should moisturize in order to support the skin's moisture barrier since skin barrier dysfunction may contribute to acne. Moisturizers, especially ceramide-containing moisturizers, as an adjunct therapy are particularly helpful for the dry skin and irritation that commonly results from topical acne treatment. Studies show that ceramide-containing moisturizers are important for optimal skin care; they enhance acne therapy adherence and complement existing acne therapies. In a study where acne patients used 1.2% clindamycin phosphate / 2.5% benzoyl peroxide gel in the morning and applied a micronized 0.05% tretinoin gel in the evening the overwhelming majority of patients experienced no cutaneous adverse events throughout the study. It was concluded that using ceramide cleanser and ceramide moisturizing cream caused the favorable tolerability, did not interfere with the treatment efficacy, and improved adherence to the regimen. The importance of preserving the acidic mantle and its barrier functions is widely accepted in the scientific community. Thus, maintaining a pH in the range 4.5 \u2013 5.5 is essential in order to keep the skin surface in its optimal, healthy conditions.\nDiet.\nCausal relationship is rarely observed with diet/nutrition and dermatologic conditions. Rather, associations \u2013 some of them compelling \u2013 have been found between diet and outcomes including disease severity and the number of conditions experienced by a patient. Evidence is emerging in support of medical nutrition therapy as a way of reducing the severity and incidence of dermatologic diseases, including acne. Researchers observed a link between high glycemic index diets and acne. Dermatologists also recommend a diet low in simple sugars as a method of improving acne. As of 2014, the available evidence is insufficient to use milk restriction for this purpose.\nMedications.\nBenzoyl peroxide.\nBenzoyl peroxide (BPO) is a first-line treatment for mild and moderate acne due to its effectiveness and mild side-effects (mainly skin irritation). In the skin follicle, benzoyl peroxide kills \"C. acnes\" by oxidizing its proteins through the formation of oxygen free radicals and benzoic acid. These free radicals likely interfere with the bacterium's metabolism and ability to make proteins. Additionally, benzoyl peroxide is mildly effective at breaking down comedones and inhibiting inflammation. Combination products use benzoyl peroxide with a topical antibiotic or retinoid, such as benzoyl peroxide/clindamycin and benzoyl peroxide/adapalene, respectively. Topical benzoyl peroxide is effective at treating acne.\nSide effects include increased skin photosensitivity, dryness, redness, and occasional peeling. Sunscreen use is often advised during treatment, to prevent sunburn. Lower concentrations of benzoyl peroxide are just as effective as higher concentrations in treating acne but are associated with fewer side effects. Unlike antibiotics, benzoyl peroxide does not appear to generate bacterial antibiotic resistance.\nRetinoids.\nRetinoids are medications that reduce inflammation, normalize the follicle cell life cycle, and reduce sebum production. They are structurally related to vitamin A. Studies show dermatologists and primary care doctors underprescribe them for acne. The retinoids appear to influence the cell life cycle in the follicle lining. This helps prevent the accumulation of skin cells within the hair follicle that can create a blockage. They are a first-line acne treatment, especially for people with dark-colored skin. Retinoids are known to lead to faster improvement of postinflammatory hyperpigmentation.\nTopical retinoids include adapalene, retinol, retinaldehyde, isotretinoin, tazarotene, trifarotene, and tretinoin. They often cause an initial flare-up of acne and facial flushing and can cause significant skin irritation. Generally speaking, retinoids increase the skin's sensitivity to sunlight and are therefore recommended for use at night. Tretinoin is the least expensive of the topical retinoids and is the most irritating to the skin, whereas adapalene is the least irritating but costs significantly more. Most formulations of tretinoin are incompatible for use with benzoyl peroxide. Tazarotene is the most effective and expensive topical retinoid but is usually not as well tolerated. In 2019 a tazarotene lotion formulation, marketed to be a less irritating option, was approved by the FDA. Retinol is a form of vitamin A that has similar but milder effects and is present in many over-the-counter moisturizers and other topical products.\nIsotretinoin is an oral retinoid that is very effective for severe nodular acne, and moderate acne that is stubborn to other treatments. One to two months of use is typically adequate to see improvement. Acne often resolves completely or is much milder after a 4\u20136\u00a0month course of oral isotretinoin. After a single round of treatment, about 80% of people report an improvement, with more than 50% reporting complete remission. About 20% of people require a second course, but 80% of those report improvement, resulting in a cumulative 96% efficacy rate.\nThere are concerns that isotretinoin is linked to adverse effects, like depression, suicidality, and anemia. There is no clear evidence to support some of these claims. Isotretinoin has been found in some studies to be superior to antibiotics or placebo in reducing acne lesions. However, a 2018 review comparing inflammatory lesions after treatment with antibiotics or isotretinoin found no difference. The frequency of adverse events was about twice as high with isotretinoin use, although these were mostly dryness-related events. No increased risk of suicide or depression was conclusively found.\nMedical authorities strictly regulate isotretinoin use in women of childbearing age due to its known harmful effects in pregnancy. For such a woman to be considered a candidate for isotretinoin, she must have a confirmed negative pregnancy test and use an effective form of birth control. In 2008, the United States started the iPLEDGE program to prevent isotretinoin use during pregnancy. iPLEDGE requires the woman to have two negative pregnancy tests and to use two types of birth control for at least one month before isotretinoin therapy begins and one month afterward. The effectiveness of the iPLEDGE program is controversial due to continued instances of contraception nonadherence.\nAntibiotics.\nPeople may apply antibiotics to the skin or take them orally to treat acne. They work by killing \"C. acnes\" and reducing inflammation. Although multiple guidelines call for healthcare providers to reduce the rates of prescribed oral antibiotics, many providers do not follow this guidance. Oral antibiotics remain the most commonly prescribed systemic therapy for acne. Widespread broad-spectrum antibiotic overuse for acne has led to higher rates of antibiotic-resistant \"C. acnes\" strains worldwide, especially to the commonly used tetracycline (e.g., doxycycline) and macrolide antibiotics (e.g., topical erythromycin). Therefore, dermatologists prefer antibiotics as part of combination therapy and not for use alone.\nCommonly used antibiotics, either applied to the skin or taken orally, include clindamycin, erythromycin, metronidazole, sulfacetamide, and tetracyclines (e.g., doxycycline or minocycline). Doxycycline 40 milligrams daily (low-dose) appears to have similar efficacy to 100 milligrams daily and has fewer gastrointestinal side effects. However, low-dose doxycycline is not FDA-approved for the treatment of acne. Antibiotics applied to the skin are typically used for mild to moderately severe acne. Oral antibiotics are generally more effective than topical antibiotics and produce faster resolution of inflammatory acne lesions than topical applications. The \"Global Alliance to Improve Outcomes in Acne\" recommends that topical and oral antibiotics are not used together.\nOral antibiotics are recommended for no longer than three months as antibiotic courses exceeding this duration are associated with the development of antibiotic resistance and show no clear benefit over shorter durations. If long-term oral antibiotics beyond three months are used, then it is recommended that benzoyl peroxide or a retinoid be used at the same time to limit the risk of \"C. acnes\" developing antibiotic resistance.\nThe antibiotic dapsone is effective against inflammatory acne when applied to the skin. It is generally not a first-line choice due to its higher cost and a lack of clear superiority over other antibiotics. Topical dapsone is sometimes a preferred therapy in women or for people with sensitive or darker-toned skin. It is not recommended for use with benzoyl peroxide due to the risk of causing yellow-orange skin discoloration with this combination. Minocycline is an effective acne treatment, but it is not a first-line antibiotic due to a lack of evidence that it is better than other treatments, and concerns about its safety compared to other tetracyclines.\nSarecycline is the most recent oral antibiotic developed specifically for the treatment of acne, and is FDA-approved for the treatment of moderate to severe inflammatory acne in patients nine years of age and older. It is a narrow-spectrum tetracycline antibiotic that exhibits the necessary antibacterial activity against pathogens related to acne vulgaris and a low propensity for inducing antibiotic resistance. In clinical trials, sarecycline demonstrated clinical efficacy in reducing inflammatory acne lesions as early as three weeks and reduced truncal (back and chest) acne.\nHormonal agents.\nIn women, the use of combined birth control pills can improve acne. These medications contain an estrogen and a progestin. They work by decreasing the production of androgen hormones by the ovaries and by decreasing the free and hence biologically active fractions of androgens, resulting in lowered skin production of sebum and consequently reduce acne severity. First-generation progestins such as norethindrone and norgestrel have androgenic properties and may worsen acne. Although oral estrogens decrease IGF-1 levels in some situations, which could theoretically improve acne symptoms, combined birth control pills do not appear to affect IGF-1 levels in fertile women. Cyproterone acetate-containing birth control pills seem to decrease total and free IGF-1 levels. Combinations containing third- or fourth-generation progestins, including desogestrel, dienogest, drospirenone, or norgestimate, as well as birth control pills containing cyproterone acetate or chlormadinone acetate, are preferred for women with acne due to their stronger antiandrogenic effects. Studies have shown a 40 to 70% reduction in acne lesions with combined birth control pills. A 2014 review found that oral antibiotics appear to be somewhat more effective than birth control pills at reducing the number of inflammatory acne lesions at three months. However, the two therapies are approximately equal in efficacy at six months for decreasing the number of inflammatory, non-inflammatory, and total acne lesions. The authors of the analysis suggested that birth control pills may be a preferred first-line acne treatment, over oral antibiotics, in certain women due to similar efficacy at six months and a lack of associated antibiotic resistance. In contrast to combined birth control pills, progestogen-only birth control forms that contain androgenic progestins have been associated with worsened acne.\nAntiandrogens such as cyproterone acetate and spironolactone can successfully treat acne, especially in women with signs of excessive androgen production, such as increased hairiness or skin production of sebum, or scalp hair loss. Spironolactone is an effective treatment for acne in adult women. Unlike combined birth control pills, it is not approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration for this purpose. Spironolactone is an aldosterone antagonist and is a useful acne treatment due to its ability to additionally block the androgen receptor at higher doses. Alone or in combination with a birth control pill, spironolactone has shown a 33 to 85% reduction in acne lesions in women. The effectiveness of spironolactone for acne appears to be dose-dependent. High-dose cyproterone acetate alone reportedly decreases acne symptoms in women by 75 to 90% within three months. It is usually combined with an estrogen to avoid menstrual irregularities and estrogen deficiency. The medication appears to be effective in the treatment of acne in males, with one study finding that a high dosage reduced inflammatory acne lesions by 73%. However, spironolactone and cyproterone acetate's side effects in males, such as gynecomastia, sexual dysfunction, and decreased bone mineral density, generally make their use for male acne impractical.\nPregnant and lactating women should not receive antiandrogens for their acne due to a possibility of birth disorders such as hypospadias and feminization of male babies. Women who are sexually active and who can or may become pregnant should use an effective method of contraception to prevent pregnancy while taking an antiandrogen. Antiandrogens are often combined with birth control pills for this reason, which can result in additive efficacy. The FDA added a black-box warning to spironolactone about possible tumor risks based on preclinical research with very high doses (&gt;100-fold clinical doses) and cautioned that unnecessary use of the medication should be avoided. However, several large epidemiological studies subsequently found no greater risk of tumors in association with spironolactone in humans. Conversely, strong associations of cyproterone acetate with certain brain tumors have been discovered and its use has been restricted. The brain tumor risk with cyproterone acetate is due to its strong progestogenic actions and is not related to antiandrogenic activity nor shared by other antiandrogens.\nFlutamide, a pure antagonist of the androgen receptor, is effective in treating acne in women. It appears to reduce acne symptoms by 80 to 90% even at low doses, with several studies showing complete acne clearance. In one study, flutamide decreased acne scores by 80% within three months, whereas spironolactone decreased symptoms by only 40% in the same period. In a large long-term study, 97% of women reported satisfaction with the control of their acne with flutamide. Although effective, flutamide has a risk of serious liver toxicity, and cases of death in women taking even low doses of the medication to treat androgen-dependent skin and hair conditions have occurred. As such, the use of flutamide for acne has become increasingly limited, and it has been argued that continued use of flutamide for such purposes is unethical. Bicalutamide, a pure androgen receptor antagonist with the same mechanism as flutamide and with comparable or superior antiandrogenic efficacy but with a far lower risk of liver toxicity, is an alternative option to flutamide in the treatment of androgen-dependent skin and hair conditions in women.\nClascoterone is a topical antiandrogen that has demonstrated effectiveness in the treatment of acne in both males and females and was approved for clinical use for this indication in August 2020. It has shown no systemic absorption or associated antiandrogenic side effects. In a small direct head-to-head comparison, clascoterone showed greater effectiveness than topical isotretinoin. 5\u03b1-Reductase inhibitors such as finasteride and dutasteride may be useful for the treatment of acne in both males and females but have not been adequately evaluated for this purpose. Moreover, 5\u03b1-reductase inhibitors have a strong potential for producing birth defects in male babies and this limits their use in women. However, 5\u03b1-reductase inhibitors are frequently used to treat excessive facial/body hair in women and can be combined with birth control pills to prevent pregnancy. There is no evidence as of 2010 to support the use of cimetidine or ketoconazole in the treatment of acne.\nHormonal treatments for acne such as combined birth control pills and antiandrogens may be considered first-line therapy for acne under many circumstances, including desired contraception, known or suspected hyperandrogenism, acne during adulthood, acne that flares premenstrually, and when symptoms of significant sebum production (seborrhea) are co-present. Hormone therapy is effective for acne both in women with hyperandrogenism and in women with normal androgen levels.\nAzelaic acid.\nAzelaic acid is effective for mild to moderate acne when applied topically at a 15\u201320% concentration. Treatment twice daily for six months is necessary, and is as effective as topical benzoyl peroxide\u00a05%, isotretinoin\u00a00.05%, and erythromycin\u00a02%. Azelaic acid is an effective acne treatment due to its ability to reduce skin cell accumulation in the follicle and its antibacterial and anti-inflammatory properties. It has a slight skin-lightening effect due to its ability to inhibit melanin synthesis. Therefore, it is useful in treating individuals with acne who are also affected by post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation. Azelaic acid may cause skin irritation. It is less effective and more expensive than retinoids. Azelaic acid also led to worse treatment response when compared to benzoyl peroxide. When compared to tretinoin, azelaic acid makes little or no treatment response.\nSalicylic acid.\nSalicylic acid is a topically applied beta-hydroxy acid that stops bacteria from reproducing and has keratolytic properties. It is less effective than retinoid therapy. Salicylic acid opens obstructed skin pores and promotes the shedding of epithelial skin cells. Dry skin is the most commonly seen side effect with topical application, though darkening of the skin can occur in individuals with darker skin types.\nOther medications.\nTopical and oral preparations of nicotinamide (the amide form of vitamin B3) are alternative medical treatments. Nicotinamide reportedly improves acne due to its anti-inflammatory properties (influencing neutrophil chemotaxis, inhibiting the release of histamine, suppressing the lymphocyte transformation test, and reducing nitric oxide synthase production induced by cytokines), its ability to suppress sebum production, and its wound healing properties. Topical and oral preparations of zinc are suggested treatments for acne; evidence to support their use for this purpose is limited. Zinc's capacities to reduce inflammation and sebum production as well as inhibit \"C. acnes\" growth are its proposed mechanisms for improving acne. Antihistamines may improve symptoms among those already taking isotretinoin due to their anti-inflammatory properties and their ability to suppress sebum production.\nHydroquinone lightens the skin when applied topically by inhibiting tyrosinase, the enzyme responsible for converting the amino acid tyrosine to the skin pigment melanin, and is used to treat acne-associated post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation. By interfering with the production of melanin in the epidermis, hydroquinone leads to less hyperpigmentation as darkened skin cells are naturally shed over time. Improvement in skin hyperpigmentation is typically seen within six months when used twice daily. Hydroquinone is ineffective for hyperpigmentation affecting deeper layers of skin such as the dermis. The use of a sunscreen with SPF\u00a015 or higher in the morning with reapplication every two hours is recommended when using hydroquinone. Its application only to affected areas lowers the risk of lightening the color of normal skin but can lead to a temporary ring of lightened skin around the hyperpigmented area. Hydroquinone is generally well-tolerated; side effects are typically mild (e.g., skin irritation) and occur with the use of a higher than the recommended 4% concentration. Most preparations contain the preservative sodium metabisulfite, which has been linked to rare cases of allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis and severe asthma exacerbations in susceptible people. In extremely rare cases, the frequent and improper application of high-dose hydroquinone has been associated with a systemic condition known as exogenous ochronosis (skin discoloration and connective tissue damage from the accumulation of homogentisic acid).\nCombination therapy.\nCombination therapy\u2014using medications of different classes together, each with a different mechanism of action\u2014has been demonstrated to be a more effective approach to acne treatment than monotherapy. The use of topical benzoyl peroxide and antibiotics together is more effective than antibiotics alone. Similarly, using a topical retinoid with an antibiotic clears acne lesions faster than the use of antibiotics alone. Frequently used combinations include the following: antibiotic and benzoyl peroxide, antibiotic and topical retinoid, or topical retinoid and benzoyl peroxide. Dermatologists generally prefer combining benzoyl peroxide with a retinoid over the combination of a topical antibiotic with a retinoid. Both regimens are effective, but benzoyl peroxide does not lead to antibiotic resistance.\nPregnancy.\nAlthough sebaceous gland activity in the skin increases during the late stages of pregnancy, pregnancy has not been reliably associated with worsened acne severity. In general, topically applied medications are considered the first-line approach to acne treatment during pregnancy, as they have little systemic absorption and are therefore unlikely to harm a developing fetus. Highly recommended therapies include topically applied benzoyl peroxide (pregnancy category C) and azelaic acid (category B). Salicylic acid carries a category C safety rating due to higher systemic absorption (9\u201325%), and an association between the use of anti-inflammatory medications in the third trimester and adverse effects to the developing fetus including too little amniotic fluid in the uterus and early closure of the babies' ductus arteriosus blood vessel. Prolonged use of salicylic acid over significant areas of the skin or under occlusive (sealed) dressings is not recommended as these methods increase systemic absorption and the potential for fetal harm. Tretinoin (category C) and adapalene (category C) are very poorly absorbed, but certain studies have suggested teratogenic effects in the first trimester. The data examining the association between maternal topical retinoid exposure in the first trimester of pregnancy and adverse pregnancy outcomes is limited. A systematic review of observational studies concluded that such exposure does not appear to increase the risk of major birth defects, miscarriages, stillbirths, premature births, or low birth weight. Similarly, in studies examining the effects of topical retinoids during pregnancy, fetal harm has not been seen in the second and third trimesters. Nevertheless, since rare harms from topical retinoids are not ruled out, they are not recommended for use during pregnancy due to persistent safety concerns. Retinoids contraindicated for use during pregnancy include the topical retinoid tazarotene, and oral retinoids isotretinoin and acitretin (all category X). Spironolactone is relatively contraindicated for use during pregnancy due to its antiandrogen effects. Finasteride is not recommended as it is highly teratogenic.\nTopical antibiotics deemed safe during pregnancy include clindamycin, erythromycin, and metronidazole (all category B), due to negligible systemic absorption. Nadifloxacin and dapsone (category C) are other topical antibiotics that may be used to treat acne in pregnant women but have received less study. No adverse fetal events have been reported from the topical use of dapsone. If retinoids are used there is a high risk of abnormalities occurring in the developing fetus; women of childbearing age are therefore required to use effective birth control if retinoids are used to treat acne. Oral antibiotics deemed safe for pregnancy (all category B) include azithromycin, cephalosporins, and penicillins. Tetracyclines (category D) are contraindicated during pregnancy as they are known to deposit in developing fetal teeth, resulting in yellow discoloration and thinned tooth enamel. Their use during pregnancy has been associated with the development of acute fatty liver of pregnancy and is further avoided for this reason.\nProcedures.\nLimited evidence supports comedo extraction, but it is an option for comedones that do not improve with standard treatment. Another procedure for immediate relief is the injection of a corticosteroid into an inflamed acne comedo. Electrocautery and electrofulguration are effective alternative treatments for comedones.\nLight therapy is a treatment method that involves delivering certain specific wavelengths of light to an area of skin affected by acne. Both regular and laser light have been used. The evidence for light therapy as a treatment for acne is weak and inconclusive. Various light therapies appear to provide a short-term benefit, but data for long-term outcomes, and outcomes in those with severe acne, are sparse; it may have a role for individuals whose acne has been resistant to topical medications. A 2016 meta-analysis was unable to conclude whether light therapies were more beneficial than placebo or no treatment, nor the duration of benefit.\nWhen regular light is used immediately following the application of a sensitizing substance to the skin such as aminolevulinic acid or methyl aminolevulinate, the treatment is referred to as photodynamic therapy (PDT). PDT has the most supporting evidence of all light therapy modalities. PDT treats acne by using various forms of light (e.g., blue light or red light) that preferentially target the pilosebaceous unit. Once the light activates the sensitizing substance, this generates free radicals and reactive oxygen species in the skin, which purposefully damage the sebaceous glands and kill \"C. acnes\" bacteria. Many different types of nonablative lasers (i.e., lasers that do not vaporize the top layer of the skin but rather induce a physiologic response in the skin from the light) have been used to treat acne, including those that use infrared wavelengths of light. Ablative lasers (such as CO2 and fractional types) have also been used to treat active acne and its scars. When ablative lasers are used, the treatment is often referred to as laser resurfacing because, as mentioned previously, the entire upper layers of the skin are vaporized. Ablative lasers are associated with higher rates of adverse effects compared with non-ablative lasers, with examples being post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation, persistent facial redness, and persistent pain. Physiologically, certain wavelengths of light, used with or without accompanying topical chemicals, are thought to kill bacteria and decrease the size and activity of the glands that produce sebum. Disadvantages of light therapy can include its cost, the need for multiple visits, the time required to complete the procedure(s), and pain associated with some of the treatment modalities. Typical side effects include skin peeling, temporary reddening of the skin, swelling, and post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation.\nPostacne scar treatment.\nDermabrasion is an effective therapeutic procedure for reducing the appearance of superficial atrophic scars of the boxcar and rolling varieties. Ice-pick scars do not respond well to treatment with dermabrasion due to their depth. The procedure is painful and has many potential side effects such as skin sensitivity to sunlight, redness, and decreased pigmentation of the skin. Dermabrasion has fallen out of favor with the introduction of laser resurfacing. Unlike dermabrasion, there is no evidence that microdermabrasion is an effective treatment for acne.\nDermal or subcutaneous fillers are substances injected into the skin to improve the appearance of acne scars. Fillers are used to increase natural collagen production in the skin and to increase skin volume and decrease the depth of acne scars. Examples of fillers used for this purpose include hyaluronic acid; poly(methyl methacrylate) microspheres with collagen; human and bovine collagen derivatives, and fat harvested from the person's own body (autologous fat transfer).\nMicroneedling is a procedure in which an instrument with multiple rows of tiny needles is rolled over the skin to elicit a wound healing response and stimulate collagen production to reduce the appearance of atrophic acne scars in people with darker skin color. Notable adverse effects of microneedling include post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation and tram track scarring (described as discrete slightly raised scars in a linear distribution similar to a tram track). The latter is thought to be primarily attributable to improper technique by the practitioner, including the use of excessive pressure or inappropriately large needles.\nA clinical study assessing the efficacy of microneedling vis-\u00e0-vis with application of topical tazarotene gel, 0.1% in the treatment of postacne facial scars, found that tazarotene gel when applied for a period of three to six months once every night, resulted in significant improvement of atrophic scars similar to microneedling.\nSubcision is useful for the treatment of superficial atrophic acne scars and involves the use of a small needle to loosen the fibrotic adhesions that result in the depressed appearance of the scar.\nChemical peels can be used to reduce the appearance of acne scars. Mild peels include those using glycolic acid, lactic acid, salicylic acid, Jessner's solution, or a lower concentration (20%) of trichloroacetic acid. These peels only affect the epidermal layer of the skin and can be useful in the treatment of superficial acne scars as well as skin pigmentation changes from inflammatory acne. Higher concentrations of trichloroacetic acid (30\u201340%) are considered to be medium-strength peels and affect the skin as deep as the papillary dermis. Formulations of trichloroacetic acid concentrated to 50% or more are considered to be deep chemical peels. Medium-strength and deep-strength chemical peels are more effective for deeper atrophic scars but are more likely to cause side effects such as skin pigmentation changes, infection, and small white superficial cysts known as milia.\nAlternative medicine.\nResearchers are investigating complementary therapies as treatment for people with acne. Low-quality evidence suggests topical application of tea tree oil or bee venom may reduce the total number of skin lesions in those with acne. Tea tree oil appears to be approximately as effective as benzoyl peroxide or salicylic acid but is associated with allergic contact dermatitis. Proposed mechanisms for tea tree oil's anti-acne effects include antibacterial action against \"C. acnes\" and anti-inflammatory properties. Numerous other plant-derived therapies have demonstrated positive effects against acne (e.g., basil oil; oligosaccharides from seaweed; however, few well-done studies have examined their use for this purpose. There is a lack of high-quality evidence for the use of acupuncture, herbal medicine, or cupping therapy for acne.\nSelf-care.\nMany over-the-counter treatments in many forms are available, which are often known as cosmeceuticals. Certain types of makeup may be useful to mask acne. In those with oily skin, a water-based product is often preferred.\nPrognosis.\nAcne usually improves around the age of 20 but may persist into adulthood. Permanent physical scarring may occur. Rare complications from acne or its treatment include the formation of pyogenic granulomas, osteoma cutis, and acne with facial edema. Early and aggressive treatment of acne is advocated by some in the medical community to reduce the chances of these poor outcomes.\nMental health impact.\nThere is good evidence to support the idea that acne and associated scarring negatively affect a person's psychological state, worsen mood, lower self-esteem, and are associated with a higher risk of anxiety disorders, depression, and suicidal thoughts.\nMisperceptions about acne's causative and aggravating factors are common, and people with acne often blame themselves, and others often blame those with acne for their condition. Such blame can worsen the affected person's sense of self-esteem. Until the 20th century, even among dermatologists, the list of causes was believed to include excessive sexual thoughts and masturbation. Dermatology's association with sexually transmitted infections, especially syphilis, contributed to the stigma.\nAnother psychological complication of acne vulgaris is acne excori\u00e9e, which occurs when a person persistently picks and scratches pimples, irrespective of the severity of their acne. This can lead to significant scarring, changes in the affected person's skin pigmentation, and a cyclic worsening of the affected person's anxiety about their appearance.\nEpidemiology.\nGlobally, acne affects approximately 650\u00a0million people, or about 9.4% of the population, as of 2010. It affects nearly 90% of people in Western societies during their teenage years, but can occur before adolescence and may persist into adulthood. While acne that first develops between the ages of 21 and 25 is uncommon, it affects 54% of women and 40% of men older than 25\u00a0years of age and has a lifetime prevalence of 85%. About 20% of those affected have moderate or severe cases. It is slightly more common in females than males (9.8% versus 9.0%). In those over 40\u00a0years old, 1% of males and 5% of females still have problems.\nRates appear to be lower in rural societies. While some research has found it affects people of all ethnic groups, acne may not occur in the non-Westernized peoples of Papua New Guinea and Paraguay.\nAcne affects 40\u201350\u00a0million people in the United States (16%) and approximately 3\u20135\u00a0million in Australia (23%). Severe acne tends to be more common in people of Caucasian or Amerindian descent than in people of African descent.\nHistory.\nHistorical records indicate that pharaohs had acne, which may be the earliest known reference to the disease. Sulfur's usefulness as a topical remedy for acne dates back to at least the reign of Cleopatra (69\u201330\u00a0BCE). The sixth-century Greek physician A\u00ebtius of Amida reportedly coined the term \" (,) or \", which seems to be a reference to facial skin lesions that occur during \"the 'acme' of life\" (puberty).\nIn the 16th century, the French physician and botanist Fran\u00e7ois Boissier de Sauvages de Lacroix provided one of the earlier descriptions of acne. He used the term \"psydracia achne\" to describe small, red, and hard tubercles that altered a person's facial appearance during adolescence and were neither itchy nor painful.\nThe recognition and characterization of acne progressed in 1776 when Josef Plenck (an Austrian physician) published a book that proposed the novel concept of classifying skin diseases by their elementary (initial) lesions. In 1808 the English dermatologist Robert Willan refined Plenck's work by providing the first detailed descriptions of several skin disorders using morphologic terminology that remains in use today. Thomas Bateman continued and expanded on Robert Willan's work as his student and provided the first descriptions and illustrations of acne accepted as accurate by modern dermatologists. Erasmus Wilson, in 1842, was the first to make the distinction between acne vulgaris and rosacea. The first professional medical monograph dedicated entirely to acne was written by Lucius Duncan Bulkley and published in New York in 1885.\nScientists initially hypothesized that acne represented a disease of the skin's hair follicle, and occurred due to blockage of the pore by sebum. During the 1880s, they observed bacteria by microscopy in skin samples from people with acne. Investigators believed the bacteria caused comedones, sebum production, and ultimately acne. During the mid-twentieth century, dermatologists realized that no single hypothesized factor (sebum, bacteria, or excess keratin) fully accounted for the disease in its entirety. This led to the current understanding that acne could be explained by a sequence of related events, beginning with blockage of the skin follicle by excessive dead skin cells, followed by bacterial invasion of the hair follicle pore, changes in sebum production, and inflammation.\nThe approach to acne treatment underwent significant changes during the twentieth century. Retinoids became a medical treatment for acne in 1943. Benzoyl peroxide was first proposed as a treatment in 1958 and remains a staple of acne treatment. The introduction of oral tetracycline antibiotics (such as minocycline) modified acne treatment in the 1950s. These reinforced the idea amongst dermatologists that bacterial growth on the skin plays an important role in causing acne. Subsequently, in the 1970s, tretinoin (original trade name Retin A) was found to be an effective treatment. The development of oral isotretinoin (sold as Accutane and Roaccutane) followed. After its introduction in the United States in 1982, scientists identified isotretinoin as a medication highly likely to cause birth defects if taken during pregnancy. In the United States, more than 2,000\u00a0women became pregnant while taking isotretinoin between 1982 and 2003, with most pregnancies ending in abortion or miscarriage. Approximately 160 babies were born with birth defects due to maternal use of isotretinoin during pregnancy.\nTreatment of acne with topical crushed dry ice, known as cryoslush, was first described in 1907 but is no longer performed commonly. Before 1960, the use of X-rays was also a common treatment.\nSociety and culture.\nThe costs and social impact of acne are substantial. In the United States, acne vulgaris is responsible for more than 5\u00a0million doctor visits and costs over \u00a0billion each year in direct costs. Similarly, acne vulgaris is responsible for 3.5\u00a0million doctor visits each year in the United Kingdom. Sales for the top ten leading acne treatment brands in the US in 2015 amounted to $352million.\nAcne vulgaris and its resultant scars are associated with significant social and academic difficulties that can last into adulthood. During the Great Depression, dermatologists discovered that young men with acne had difficulty obtaining jobs. Until the 1930s, many people viewed acne as a trivial problem among middle-class girls because, unlike smallpox and tuberculosis, no one died from it, and a feminine problem, because boys were much less likely to seek medical assistance for it. During World War II, some soldiers in tropical climates developed such severe and widespread tropical acne on their bodies that they were declared medically unfit for duty.\nResearch.\nEfforts to better understand the mechanisms of sebum production are underway. This research aims to develop medications that target and interfere with the hormones that are known to increase sebum production (e.g., IGF-1 and alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone). Other sebum-lowering medications such as topical antiandrogens, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor modulators, and inhibitors of the stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 enzyme are also a focus of research efforts. Particles that release nitric oxide into the skin to decrease skin inflammation caused by \"C. acnes\" and the immune system have shown promise for improving acne in early clinical trials. Another avenue of early-stage research has focused on how to best use laser and light therapy to selectively destroy sebum-producing glands in the skin's hair follicles to reduce sebum production and improve acne appearance.\nThe use of antimicrobial peptides against \"C. acnes\" is under investigation as a treatment for acne to overcoming antibiotic resistance. In 2007, scientists reported the first genome sequencing of a \"C. acnes\" bacteriophage (PA6). The authors proposed applying this research toward the development of bacteriophage therapy as an acne treatment to overcome the problems associated with long-term antibiotic use, such as bacterial resistance. Oral and topical probiotics are under evaluation as treatments for acne. Probiotics may have therapeutic effects for those affected by acne due to their ability to decrease skin inflammation and improve skin moisture by increasing the skin's ceramide content. As of 2014, knowledge of the effects of probiotics on acne in humans was limited.\nDecreased levels of retinoic acid in the skin may contribute to comedo formation. Researchers are investigating methods to increase the skin's production of retinoic acid to address this deficiency. A vaccine against inflammatory acne has shown promising results in mice and humans. Some have voiced concerns about creating a vaccine designed to neutralize a stable community of normal skin bacteria that is known to protect the skin from colonization by more harmful microorganisms.\nOther animals.\nAcne can occur on cats, dogs, and horses.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
