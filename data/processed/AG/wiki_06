{"id": "75233", "revid": "2842084", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=75233", "title": "Hilary Putnam", "text": "American mathematician and philosopher (1926\u20132016)\nHilary Whitehall Putnam (; July 31, 1926 \u2013 March 13, 2016) was an American philosopher, mathematician, computer scientist, and figure in analytic philosophy in the second half of the 20th century. He contributed to the studies of philosophy of mind, philosophy of language, philosophy of mathematics, and philosophy of science. Outside philosophy, Putnam contributed to mathematics and computer science. Together with Martin Davis he developed the Davis\u2013Putnam algorithm for the Boolean satisfiability problem and he helped demonstrate the unsolvability of Hilbert's tenth problem.\nPutnam applied equal scrutiny to his own philosophical positions as to those of others, subjecting each position to rigorous analysis until he exposed its flaws. As a result, he acquired a reputation for frequently changing his positions. In philosophy of mind, Putnam argued against the type-identity of mental and physical states based on his hypothesis of the multiple realizability of the mental, and for the concept of functionalism, an influential theory regarding the mind\u2013body problem. Putnam also originated the computational theory of mind. In philosophy of language, along with Saul Kripke and others, he developed the causal theory of reference, and formulated an original theory of meaning, introducing the notion of semantic externalism based on a thought experiment called Twin Earth.\nIn philosophy of mathematics, Putnam and W. V. O. Quine developed the Quine\u2013Putnam indispensability argument, an argument for the reality of mathematical entities, later espousing the view that mathematics is not purely logical, but \"quasi-empirical\". In epistemology, Putnam criticized the \"brain in a vat\" thought experiment, which appears to provide a powerful argument for epistemological skepticism, by challenging its coherence. In metaphysics, he originally espoused a position called metaphysical realism, but eventually became one of its most outspoken critics, first adopting a view he called \"internal realism\", which he later abandoned. Despite these changes of view, throughout his career Putnam remained committed to scientific realism, roughly the view that mature scientific theories are approximately true descriptions of ways things are.\nIn his later work, Putnam became increasingly interested in American pragmatism, Jewish philosophy, and ethics, engaging with a wider array of philosophical traditions. He also displayed an interest in metaphilosophy, seeking to \"renew philosophy\" from what he identified as narrow and inflated concerns. He was at times a politically controversial figure, especially for his involvement with the Progressive Labor Party in the late 1960s and early 1970s.\nLife.\nHilary Whitehall Putnam was born on July 31, 1926, in Chicago, Illinois. His father, Samuel Putnam, was a scholar of Romance languages, columnist, and translator who wrote for the \"Daily Worker\", a publication of the American Communist Party, from 1936 to 1946. Because of his father's commitment to communism, Putnam had a secular upbringing, although his mother, Riva, was Jewish. In early 1927, six months after Hilary's birth, the family moved to France, where Samuel was under contract to translate the surviving works of Fran\u00e7ois Rabelais. In a 2015 autobiographical essay, Putnam said that his first childhood memories were from his life in France, and his first language was French.\nPutnam completed the first two years of his primary education in France before he and his parents returned to the U.S. in 1933, settling in Philadelphia. There, he attended Central High School, where he met Noam Chomsky, who was a year behind him. The two remained friends\u2014and often intellectual opponents\u2014for the rest of Putnam's life. Putnam studied philosophy at the University of Pennsylvania, receiving his B.A. degree and becoming a member of the Philomathean Society, the country's oldest continually existing collegiate literary society. He did graduate work in philosophy at Harvard University and later at UCLA's philosophy department, where he received his Ph.D. in 1951 for his dissertation, \"The Meaning of the Concept of Probability in Application to Finite Sequences\". Putnam's dissertation supervisor Hans Reichenbach was a leading figure in logical positivism, the dominant school of philosophy of the day; one of Putnam's most consistent positions was his rejection of logical positivism as self-defeating. Over the course of his life, Putnam was his own philosophical adversary, changing his positions on philosophical questions and critiquing his previous views.\nAfter obtaining his PhD, Putnam taught at Northwestern University (1951\u201352), Princeton University (1953\u201361), and MIT (1961\u201365). For the rest of his career, Putnam taught at Harvard's philosophy department, becoming Cogan University Professor. In 1962, he married fellow philosopher Ruth Anna Putnam (born Ruth Anna Jacobs), who took a teaching position in philosophy at Wellesley College. Rebelling against the antisemitism they experienced during their youth, the Putnams decided to establish a traditional Jewish home for their children. Since they had no experience with the rituals of Judaism, they sought out invitations to other Jewish homes for Seder. They began to study Jewish rituals and Hebrew, became more interested in Judaism, self-identified as Jews, and actively practiced Judaism. In 1994, Hilary celebrated a belated bar mitzvah service; Ruth Anna's bat mitzvah was celebrated four years later.\nIn the 1960s and early 1970s, Putnam was an active supporter of the American Civil Rights Movement and he was also an active opponent of the Vietnam War. In 1963, he organized one of MIT's first faculty and student anti-war committees. After moving to Harvard in 1965, he organized campus protests and began teaching courses on Marxism. Putnam became an official faculty advisor to the Students for a Democratic Society and in 1968 a member of the Progressive Labor Party (PLP). He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1965. After 1968, his political activities centered on the PLP. The Harvard administration considered these activities disruptive and attempted to censure Putnam. Putnam permanently severed his relationship with the PLP in 1972. In 1997, at a meeting of former draft resistance activists at Boston's Arlington Street Church, he called his involvement with the PLP a mistake. He said he had been impressed at first with the PLP's commitment to alliance-building and its willingness to attempt to organize from within the armed forces.\nIn 1976, Putnam was elected president of the American Philosophical Association. The next year, he was selected as Walter Beverly Pearson Professor of Mathematical Logic in recognition of his contributions to the philosophy of logic and mathematics. While breaking with his radical past, Putnam never abandoned his belief that academics have a particular social and ethical responsibility toward society. He continued to be forthright and progressive in his political views, as expressed in the articles \"How Not to Solve Ethical Problems\" (1983) and \"Education for Democracy\" (1993).\nPutnam was a Corresponding Fellow of the British Academy. He was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 1999. He retired from teaching in June 2000, becoming Cogan University Professor Emeritus, but as of 2009 continued to give a seminar almost yearly at Tel Aviv University. He also held the Spinoza Chair of Philosophy at the University of Amsterdam in 2001. His corpus includes five volumes of collected works, seven books, and more than 200 articles. Putnam's renewed interest in Judaism inspired him to publish several books and essays on the topic. With his wife, he co-authored several essays and a book on the late-19th-century American pragmatist movement.\nFor his contributions in philosophy and logic, Putnam was awarded the Rolf Schock Prize in 2011 and the Nicholas Rescher Prize for Systematic Philosophy in 2015. Putnam died at his home in Arlington, Massachusetts, on March 13, 2016. At the time of his death, Putnam was Cogan University Professor Emeritus at Harvard University.\nPhilosophy of mind.\nMultiple realizability.\nPutnam's best-known work concerns philosophy of mind. His most noted original contributions to that field came in several key papers published in the late 1960s that set out the hypothesis of multiple realizability. In these papers, Putnam argues that, contrary to the famous claim of the type-identity theory, pain may correspond to utterly different physical states of the nervous system in different organisms even if they all experience the same mental state of \"being in pain\". Putnam cited examples from the animal kingdom to illustrate his thesis. He asked whether it was likely that the brain structures of diverse types of animals realize pain, or other mental states, the same way. If they do not share the same brain structures, they cannot share the same mental states and properties, in which case mental states must be realized by different physical states in different species. Putnam then took his argument a step further, asking about such things as the nervous systems of alien beings, artificially intelligent robots and other silicon-based life forms. These hypothetical entities, he contended, should not be considered incapable of experiencing pain just because they lack human neurochemistry. Putnam concluded that type-identity theorists had been making an \"ambitious\" and \"highly implausible\" conjecture that could be disproved by one example of multiple realizability. This is sometimes called the \"likelihood argument\", as it focuses on the claim that multiple realizability is more likely than type-identity theory.640\nPutnam also formulated an \"a priori\" argument in favor of multiple realizability based on what he called \"functional isomorphism\". He defined the concept in these terms: \"Two systems are functionally isomorphic if 'there is a correspondence between the states of one and the states of the other that preserves functional relations'.\" In the case of computers, two machines are functionally isomorphic if and only if the sequential relations among states in the first exactly mirror the sequential relations among states in the other. Therefore, a computer made of silicon chips and one made of cogs and wheels can be functionally isomorphic but constitutionally diverse. Functional isomorphism implies multiple realizability.637\nPutnam, Jerry Fodor, and others argued that along with being an effective argument against type-identity theories, multiple realizability implies that any low-level explanation of higher-level mental phenomena is insufficiently abstract and general. Functionalism, which identifies mental kinds with functional kinds that are characterized exclusively in terms of causes and effects, abstracts from the level of microphysics, and therefore seemed to be a better explanation of the relation between mind and body. In fact, there are many functional kinds, including mousetraps and eyes, that are multiply realized at the physical level.6\nMultiple realizability has been criticized on the grounds that, if it were true, research and experimentation in the neurosciences would be impossible. According to William Bechtel and Jennifer Mundale, to be able to conduct such research in the neurosciences, universal consistencies must either exist or be assumed to exist in brain structures. It is the similarity (or homology) of brain structures that allows us to generalize across species. If multiple realizability were an empirical fact, results from experiments conducted on one species of animal (or one organism) would not be meaningful when generalized to explain the behavior of another species (or organism of the same species). Jaegwon Kim, David Lewis, Robert Richardson and Patricia Churchland have also criticized metaphysical realism.\nMachine state functionalism.\nPutnam himself put forth the first formulation of such a functionalist theory. This formulation, now called \"machine-state functionalism\", was inspired by analogies Putnam and others made between the mind and Turing machines. The point for functionalism is the nature of the states of the Turing machine. Each state can be defined in terms of its relations to the other states and to the inputs and outputs, and the details of how it accomplishes what it accomplishes and of its material constitution are completely irrelevant. According to machine-state functionalism, the nature of a mental state is just like the nature of a Turing machine state. Just as \"state one\" simply is the state in which, given a particular input, such-and-such happens, so being in pain is the state which disposes one to cry \"ouch\", become distracted, wonder what the cause is, and so forth.\nRejection of functionalism.\nIan Hacking called \"Representation and Reality\" (1988) a book that \"will mostly be read as Putnam's denunciation of his former philosophical psychology, to which he gave the name 'functionalism'.\" Writing in \"No\u00fbs\", Barbara Hannon described \"the inventor of functionalism\" as arguing \"against his own former computationalist views\".\nPutnam's change of mind was primarily due to the difficulties computational theories have in explaining certain intuitions with respect to the externalism of mental content. This is illustrated by his Twin Earth thought experiment.\nIn 1988 Putnam also developed a separate argument against functionalism based on Fodor's generalized version of multiple realizability. Asserting that functionalism is really a watered-down identity theory in which mental kinds are identified with functional kinds, he argued that mental kinds may be multiply realizable over functional kinds. The argument for functionalism is that the same mental state could be implemented by the different states of a universal Turing machine.\nDespite Putnam's rejection of functionalism, it has continued to flourish and been developed into numerous versions by Fodor, David Marr, Daniel Dennett, and David Lewis, among others. Functionalism helped lay the foundations for modern cognitive science and was the dominant theory of mind in philosophy in the last part of the 20th century.\nBy 2012 Putnam accepted a modification of functionalism called \"liberal functionalism\". The view holds that \"what matters for consciousness and for mental properties generally is the right sort of functional capacities and not the particular matter that subserves those capacities\". The specification of these capacities may refer to what goes on outside the organism's \"brain\", may include intentional idioms, and need not describe a capacity to compute something or other.\nPutnam himself formulated one of the main arguments against functionalism, the Twin Earth thought experiment, though there have been additional criticisms. John Searle's Chinese room argument (1980) is a direct attack on the claim that thought can be represented as a set of functions. It is designed to show that it is possible to mimic intelligent action with a purely functional system, without any interpretation or understanding. Searle describes a situation in which a person who speaks only English is locked in a room with Chinese symbols in baskets and a rule book in English for moving the symbols around. People outside the room instruct the person inside to follow the rule book for sending certain symbols out of the room when given certain symbols. The people outside the room speak Chinese and are communicating with the person inside via the Chinese symbols. According to Searle, it would be absurd to claim that the English speaker inside \"knows\" Chinese based on these syntactic processes alone. This argument attempts to show that systems that operate merely on syntactic processes cannot realize any semantics (meaning) or intentionality (aboutness). Searle thus attacks the idea that thought can be equated with following a set of syntactic rules and concludes that functionalism is an inadequate theory of the mind. Ned Block has advanced several other arguments against functionalism.\nPhilosophy of language.\nSemantic externalism.\nOne of Putnam's contributions to philosophy of language is his semantic externalism, the claim that terms' meanings are determined by factors outside the mind, encapsulated in his slogan that \"meaning just ain't in the head\". His views on meaning, first laid out in \"Meaning and Reference\" (1973), then in\" The Meaning of \"Meaning\"\" (1975), use his \"Twin Earth\" thought experiment to defend this thesis.\nTwin Earth shows this, according to Putnam, since on Twin Earth everything is identical to Earth, except that its lakes, rivers and oceans are filled with XYZ rather than H2O. Consequently, when an earthling, Fredrick, uses the Earth-English word \"water\", it has a different meaning from the Twin Earth-English word \"water\" when used by his physically identical twin, Frodrick, on Twin Earth. Since Fredrick and Frodrick are physically indistinguishable when they utter their respective words, and since their words have different meanings, meaning cannot be determined solely by what is in their heads. This led Putnam to adopt a version of semantic externalism with regard to meaning and mental content. The philosopher of mind and language Donald Davidson, despite his many differences of opinion with Putnam, wrote that semantic externalism constituted an \"anti-subjectivist revolution\" in philosophers' way of seeing the world. Since Descartes's time, philosophers had been concerned with proving knowledge from the basis of subjective experience. Thanks to Putnam, Saul Kripke, Tyler Burge and others, Davidson said, philosophy could now take the objective realm for granted and start questioning the alleged \"truths\" of subjective experience.\nTheory of meaning.\nAlong with Kripke, Keith Donnellan, and others, Putnam contributed to what is known as the causal theory of reference. In particular, he maintained in \"The Meaning of \"Meaning\"\" that the objects referred to by natural kind terms\u2014such as \"tiger\", \"water\", and \"tree\"\u2014are the principal elements of the meaning of such terms. There is a linguistic division of labor, analogous to Adam Smith's economic division of labor, according to which such terms have their references fixed by the \"experts\" in the particular field of science to which the terms belong. So, for example, the reference of the term \"lion\" is fixed by the community of zoologists, the reference of the term \"elm tree\" is fixed by the community of botanists, and chemists fix the reference of the term \"table salt\" as sodium chloride. These referents are considered rigid designators in the Kripkean sense and are disseminated outward to the linguistic community.\nPutnam specifies a finite sequence of elements (a vector) for the description of the meaning of every term in the language. Such a vector consists of four components:\nSuch a \"meaning-vector\" provides a description of the reference and use of an expression within a particular linguistic community. It provides the conditions for its correct usage and makes it possible to judge whether a single speaker attributes the appropriate meaning to it or whether its use has changed enough to cause a difference in its meaning. According to Putnam, it is legitimate to speak of a change in the meaning of an expression only if the reference of the term, and not its stereotype, has changed. But since no possible algorithm can determine which aspect\u2014the stereotype or the reference\u2014has changed in a particular case, it is necessary to consider the usage of other expressions of the language. Since there is no limit to the number of such expressions to be considered, Putnam embraced a form of semantic holism.\nDespite the many changes in his other positions, Putnam consistently adhered to semantic holism. Michael Dummett, Jerry Fodor, Ernest Lepore, and others have identified problems with this position. In the first place, they suggest that, if semantic holism is true, it is impossible to understand how a speaker of a language can learn the meaning of an expression in the language. Given the limits of our cognitive abilities, we will never be able to master the whole of the English (or any other) language, even based on the (false) assumption that languages are static and immutable entities. Thus, if one must understand all of a natural language to understand a single word or expression, language learning is simply impossible. Semantic holism also fails to explain how two speakers can mean the same thing when using the same expression, and therefore how any communication is possible between them. Given a sentence \"P\", since Fred and Mary have each mastered different parts of the English language and \"P\" is related in different ways to the sentences in each part, \"P\" means one thing to Fred and something else to Mary. Moreover, if \"P\" derives its meaning from its relations with all the sentences of a language, as soon as the vocabulary of an individual changes by the addition or elimination of a sentence, the totality of relations changes, and therefore also the meaning of \"P\". As this is a common phenomenon, the result is that \"P\" has two different meanings in two different moments in the life of the same person. Consequently, if one accepts the truth of a sentence and then rejects it later on, the meaning of what one rejected and what one accepted are completely different and therefore one cannot change opinions with regard to the same sentences.\nPhilosophy of mathematics.\nIn the philosophy of mathematics, Putnam has utilized indispensability arguments to argue for a realist interpretation of mathematics. In his 1971 book \"Philosophy of Logic\", he presented what has since been called the \"locus classicus\" of the Quine\u2013Putnam indispensability argument. The argument, which he attributed to Willard Van Orman Quine, is presented in the book as \"quantification over mathematical entities is indispensable for science, both formal and physical; therefore we should accept such quantification; but this commits us to accepting the existence of the mathematical entities in question.\" According to Charles Parsons, Putnam \"very likely\" endorsed this version of the argument in his early work, but later came to deny some of the views present in it.\nIn 1975, Putnam formulated his own indispensability argument based on the no miracles argument in the philosophy of science, saying, \"I believe that the positive argument for realism [in science] has an analogue in the case of mathematical realism. Here too, I believe, realism is the only philosophy that doesn't make the success of the science a miracle\". According to Putnam, Quine's version of the argument was an argument for the existence of abstract mathematical objects, while Putnam's own argument was simply for a realist interpretation of mathematics, which he believed could be provided by a \"mathematics as modal logic\" interpretation that need not imply the existence of abstract objects.\nPutnam also held the view that mathematics, like physics and other empirical sciences, uses both strict logical proofs and \"quasi-empirical\" methods.150 For example, Fermat's Last Theorem states that for no integer formula_1 are there positive integer values of \"x\", \"y\", and \"z\" such that formula_2. Before Andrew Wiles proved this for all formula_1 in 1995, it had been proved for many values of \"n\". These proofs inspired further research in the area, and formed a quasi-empirical consensus for the theorem. Even though such knowledge is more conjectural than a strictly proved theorem, it was still used in developing other mathematical ideas.\nThe Quine\u2013Putnam indispensability argument has been extremely influential in the philosophy of mathematics, inspiring continued debate and development of the argument in contemporary philosophy of mathematics. According to the \"Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy\", many in the field consider it the best argument for mathematical realism. Prominent counterarguments come from Hartry Field, who argues that mathematics is not indispensable to science, and Penelope Maddy and Elliott Sober, who dispute whether we are committed to mathematical realism even if it is indispensable to science.\nMathematics and computer science.\nPutnam has contributed to scientific fields not directly related to his work in philosophy. As a mathematician, he contributed to the resolution of Hilbert's tenth problem in mathematics. This problem (now known as Matiyasevich's theorem or the MRDP theorem) was settled by Yuri Matiyasevich in 1970, with a proof that relied heavily on previous research by Putnam, Julia Robinson and Martin Davis.\nIn computability theory, Putnam investigated the structure of the ramified analytical hierarchy, its connection with the constructible hierarchy and its Turing degrees. He showed that there are many levels of the constructible hierarchy that add no subsets of the integers. Later, with his student George Boolos, he showed that the first such \"non-index\" is the ordinal formula_4 of ramified analysis (this is the smallest formula_5 such that formula_6 is a model of full second-order comprehension). Also, together with a separate paper with his student Richard Boyd and Gustav Hensel, he demonstrated how the Davis\u2013Mostowski\u2013Kleene hyperarithmetical hierarchy of arithmetical degrees can be naturally extended up to formula_4.\nIn computer science, Putnam is known for the Davis\u2013Putnam algorithm for the Boolean satisfiability problem (SAT), developed with Martin Davis in 1960. The algorithm finds whether there is a set of true or false values that satisfies a given Boolean expression so that the entire expression becomes true. In 1962, they further refined the algorithm with the help of George Logemann and Donald W. Loveland. It became known as the DPLL algorithm. It is efficient and still forms the basis of most complete SAT solvers.\nEpistemology.\nIn epistemology, Putnam is known for his argument against skeptical scenarios based on the \"brain in a vat\" thought experiment (a modernized version of Descartes's evil demon hypothesis). The argument is that one cannot coherently suspect that one is a disembodied \"brain in a vat\" placed there by some \"mad scientist\".\nThis follows from the causal theory of reference. Words always refer to the kinds of things they were coined to refer to, the kinds of things their user, or the user's ancestors, experienced. So, if some person, Mary, is a \"brain in a vat\", whose every experience is received through wiring and other gadgetry created by the mad scientist, then Mary's idea of a brain does not refer to a real brain, since she and her linguistic community have never encountered such a thing. To her a brain is actually an image fed to her through the wiring. Nor does her idea of a vat refer to a real vat. So if, as a brain in a vat, she says, \"I'm a brain in a vat\", she is actually saying, \"I'm a brain-image in a vat-image\", which is incoherent. On the other hand, if she is not a brain in a vat, then saying that she is a brain in a vat is still incoherent, because she actually means the opposite. This is a form of epistemological externalism: knowledge or justification depends on factors outside the mind and is not solely determined internally.\nPutnam has clarified that his real target in this argument was never skepticism, but metaphysical realism, which he thought implied such skeptical scenarios were possible. Since realism of this kind assumes the existence of a gap between how one conceives the world and the way the world really is, skeptical scenarios such as this one (or Descartes's evil demon) present a formidable challenge. By arguing that such a scenario is impossible, Putnam attempts to show that this notion of a gap between one's concept of the world and the way it is is absurd. One cannot have a \"God's-eye\" view of reality. One is limited to one's conceptual schemes, and metaphysical realism is therefore false.\nPutnam's brain in a vat argument has been criticized. Crispin Wright argues that Putnam's formulation of the brain-in-a-vat scenario is too narrow to refute global skepticism. The possibility that one is a recently disembodied brain in a vat is not undermined by semantic externalism. If a person has lived their entire life outside the vat\u2014speaking the English language and interacting normally with the outside world\u2014before \"envatment\" by a mad scientist, when they wake up inside the vat, their words and thoughts (e.g., \"tree\" and \"grass\") will still refer to the objects or events in the external world they had referred to before envatment.\nMetaphilosophy and ontology.\nIn the late 1970s and the 1980s, stimulated by results from mathematical logic and by some of Quine's ideas, Putnam abandoned his long-standing defense of metaphysical realism\u2014the view that the categories and structures of the external world are both causally and ontologically independent of the conceptualizations of the human mind\u2014and adopted a rather different view, which he called \"internal realism\" or \"pragmatic realism\".404 Internal realism is the view that, although the world may be \"causally\" independent of the human mind, the world's structure\u2014its division into kinds, individuals and categories\u2014is a function of the human mind, and hence the world is not \"ontologically\" independent. The general idea is influenced by Immanuel Kant's idea of the dependence of our knowledge of the world on the categories of thought.\nAccording to Putnam, the problem with metaphysical realism is that it fails to explain the possibility of reference and truth. According to the metaphysical realist, our concepts and categories refer because they match up in some mysterious manner with the categories, kinds and individuals inherent in the external world. But how is it possible that the world \"carves up\" into certain structures and categories, the mind carves up the world into its own categories and structures, and the two carvings perfectly coincide? The answer must be that the world does not come pre-structured but that the human mind and its conceptual schemes impose structure on it. In \"Reason, Truth, and History\", Putnam identified truth with what he termed \"idealized rational acceptability.\" The theory is that a belief is true if it would be accepted by anyone under ideal epistemic conditions.\u00a77.1\nNelson Goodman formulated a similar notion in \"Fact, Fiction and Forecast\" (1956). \"We have come to think of the actual as one among many possible worlds. We need to repaint that picture. All possible worlds lie within the actual one\", Goodman wrote. Putnam rejected this form of social constructivism, but retained the idea that there can be many correct descriptions of reality. None of these descriptions can be scientifically proven to be the \"one, true\" description of the world. He thus accepted \"conceptual relativity\"\u2014the view that it may be a matter of choice or convention, e.g., whether mereological sums exist, or whether spacetime points are individuals or mere limits.\nCurtis Brown has criticized Putnam's internal realism as a disguised form of subjective idealism, in which case it is subject to the traditional arguments against that position. In particular, it falls into the trap of solipsism. That is, if existence depends on experience, as subjective idealism maintains, and if one's consciousness ceased to exist, then the rest of the universe would also cease to exist. In his reply to Simon Blackburn in the volume \"Reading Putnam\", Putnam renounced internal realism because it assumed a \"cognitive interface\" model of the relation between the mind and the world. Under the increasing influence of William James and the pragmatists, he adopted a direct realist view of this relation. Although he abandoned internal realism, Putnam still resisted the idea that any given thing or system of things can be described in exactly one complete and correct way. He came to accept metaphysical realism in a broader sense, rejecting all forms of verificationism and all talk of our \"making\" the world.\nIn the philosophy of perception, Putnam came to endorse direct realism, according to which perceptual experiences directly present one with the external world. He once further held that there are no mental representations, sense data, or other intermediaries between the mind and the world. By 2012, however, he rejected this commitment in favor of \"transactionalism\", a view that accepts both that perceptual experiences are world-involving transactions, and that these transactions are functionally describable (provided that worldly items and intentional states may be referred to in the specification of the function). Such transactions can further involve qualia.\nQuantum mechanics.\nDuring his career, Putnam espoused various positions on the interpretation of quantum mechanics. In the 1960s and 1970s, he contributed to the quantum logic tradition, holding that the way to resolve quantum theory's apparent paradoxes is to modify the logical rules by which propositions' truth values are deduced. Putnam's first foray into this topic was \"A Philosopher Looks at Quantum Mechanics\" in 1965, followed by his 1969 essay \"Is Logic Empirical?\". He advanced different versions of quantum logic over the years, and eventually turned away from it in the 1990s, due to critiques by Nancy Cartwright, Michael Redhead, and others. In 2005, he wrote that he rejected the many-worlds interpretation because he could see no way for it to yield meaningful probabilities. He found both de Broglie\u2013Bohm theory and the spontaneous collapse theory of Ghirardi, Rimini, and Weber to be promising, yet also dissatisfying, since it was not clear that either could be made fully consistent with special relativity's symmetry requirements.\nNeopragmatism and Wittgenstein.\nIn the mid-1970s, Putnam became increasingly disillusioned with what he perceived as modern analytic philosophy's \"scientism\" and focus on metaphysics over ethics and everyday concerns. He also became convinced by his readings of James and John Dewey that there is no fact\u2013value dichotomy; that is, normative (e.g., ethical and aesthetic) judgments often have a factual basis, while scientific judgments have a normative element.240 For a time, under Ludwig Wittgenstein's influence, Putnam adopted a pluralist view of philosophy itself and came to view most philosophical problems as no more than conceptual or linguistic confusions philosophers created by using ordinary language out of context. A book of articles on pragmatism by Ruth Anna Putnam and Hilary Putnam, \"Pragmatism as a Way of Life: The Lasting Legacy of William James and John Dewey\", edited by David Macarthur, was published in 2017.\nMany of Putnam's last works addressed the concerns of ordinary people, particularly social problems. For example, he wrote about the nature of democracy, social justice and religion. He also discussed J\u00fcrgen Habermas's ideas, and wrote articles influenced by continental philosophy.\nLegacy.\nRecognition.\nPhilosopher Martha Nussbaum called Putnam one of the greatest philosophers ever produced by America and compared him to Aristotle in that both made prolific contributions to a wide range of topics, even noting that Putnam added to a couple of areas Aristotle did not. The linguist and activist Noam Chomsky stated that \"he had enormous talents and creativity, one of the finest minds I've ever encountered.\" Philosopher Warren Goldfarb stated \"I don't know anyone else who had his breadth or so quickly assimilated things in all different areas. He was essentially the quickest mind I've ever encountered.\"\nWorks.\nSelect papers, book chapters and essays.\nAn exhaustive bibliography of Putnam's writings, compiled by John R. Shook, can be found in \"The Philosophy Of Hilary Putnam\" (2015).\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

In contrast, US\u00a01 in Maine is much closer to the coast than I-95, which runs farther inland than US\u00a01. The route connects most of the major cities of the East Coast from the Southeastern United States to New England, including Miami, Jacksonville, Augusta, Columbia, Raleigh, Richmond, Washington, D.C., Baltimore, Philadelphia, Newark, New York City, New Haven, Providence, Boston, and Portland.\nWhile US\u00a01 is generally the easternmost of the main north\u2013south U.S. Routes, parts of several others occupy corridors closer to the ocean. When the road system was laid out in the 1920s, US\u00a01 was mostly assigned to the existing Atlantic Highway, which followed the Atlantic Seaboard Fall Line between the Piedmont and the Atlantic Plain north of Augusta, Georgia. At the time, the highways farther east were of lower quality and did not serve the major population centers. From Henderson, North Carolina, to Petersburg, Virginia, it is paralleled by I-85. Construction of the Interstate Highway System gradually changed the use and character of US\u00a01, and I-95 became the major north\u2013south East Coast highway by the late 1960s.\nRoute description.\nFlorida.\nUS\u00a01 travels along the east coast of Florida, beginning at 490 Whitehead Street in Key West and passing through Miami, Hollywood, Fort Lauderdale, Boca Raton, West Palm Beach, Jupiter, Fort Pierce, Melbourne, Cocoa, Titusville, Daytona Beach, Palm Coast, St. Augustine, and Jacksonville. The southernmost piece through the chain islands of the Florida Keys, about long, is the two-lane Overseas Highway, originally built in the late 1930s after railroad tycoon Henry Flagler's Florida East Coast Railway's Overseas Railroad, which was built between 1905 and 1912 on stone pillars, was ruined by the 1935 Labor Day hurricane. The rest of US\u00a01 in Florida is generally a four-lane divided highway, despite the existence of the newer I-95 not far away. Famous vacation scenic route State Road\u00a0A1A is a continuous oceanfront alternate to US\u00a01 that runs along the beaches of the Atlantic Ocean, cut only by assorted unbridged inlets and the Kennedy Space Center at Cape Canaveral. North of Jacksonville, US\u00a01 turns northwest toward Augusta, Georgia; US\u00a017 becomes the coastal route into Virginia, where US\u00a013 takes over. In Florida until the 1990s, US\u00a01 used high-contrast markers (white text on a red background).\nGeorgia.\nThe part of US\u00a01 in Georgia, as it shifts from the coastal alignment in Florida to the Atlantic Seaboard Fall Line alignment in South Carolina, is generally very rural, passing through marshes and former plantations between the towns and cities of Folkston, Waycross, Alma, Baxley, Lyons, Swainsboro, and Augusta. The Georgia Department of Transportation has an ongoing plan to widen all of US\u00a01 to four lanes with bypasses, which is more than 50\u00a0percent complete.\nThe Carolinas.\nIn South Carolina, US\u00a01 generally serves mostly rural areas as it falls west of I-95 while the coastal areas are served by routes east of it. Starting in South Carolina, US\u00a01 is paralleled by I-20 along the Atlantic Seaboard Fall Line through Aiken, Lexington, and Columbia to Camden and Lugoff. US\u00a01 functions as a local two-lane road with occasional boulevard stretches. After Camden, US\u00a01 continues northeast away from any Interstate toward Bethune, Patrick, McBee, and Cheraw with no bypasses or four-lane sections except around Cheraw through the US\u00a052 and South Carolina Highway 9 (SC\u00a09) concurrencies. After SC\u00a09, it continues northward into North Carolina as a two -lane highway. The South Carolina Department of Transportation (SCDOT) has no plans to widen or bypass any US\u00a01 alignments northeast of Camden to the North Carolina line.\nBetween the South Carolina line and the US\u00a074 bypass, US\u00a01 is a two-lane road but sees a considerable amount of truck and tourist traffic of people cutting through from the US\u00a074/US\u00a0220 and I-73/I-74 corridor attempting to reach points south and east. US\u00a01 goes through downtown Rockingham, with a bypass in the future plans. North of the North Carolina Highway 177 (NC\u00a0177) junction, it becomes four lanes or greater, becoming a superstreet with limited access and then becoming a limited access freeway. US\u00a01 becomes a major artery for the state as it moves north of Rockingham. After Richmond County, it goes into Moore County with two expressway bypasses in Southern Pines, Vass, and Cameron. US\u00a01 continues with the Jefferson Davis Highway label through Lee County and Sanford, and on to Cary and Raleigh. US\u00a01 runs concurrently with US\u00a064 through most of Cary, where the freeway recently underwent a major renovation and improvements that added lanes in both directions. North of Raleigh, US\u00a01 (known as Capital Boulevard in northern Wake County) crosses I-540 and then again becomes a four-lane divided arterial to I-85 near Henderson. The North Carolina Department of Transportation (NCDOT) has begun a corridor study for this section of US\u00a01 to determine the feasibility of transitioning the stretch of highway from I-540 to Wake Forest into a toll road. Moreover, NCDOT is planning to finish four-laning US\u00a01 in Richmond County past NC\u00a0177 with a Rockingham bypass to the east. There are no plans from SCDOT to widen US\u00a01 from the state line. From Henderson into Virginia, US\u00a01 runs parallel with I-85 as a two-lane local road until the state line, where Virginia hosts a continuous third center lane for alternate passing toward US\u00a058 before South Hill.\nMid-Atlantic.\nIn the Mid-Atlantic, US\u00a01 generally serves some of the most populated areas of the east coast. Through Virginia, US\u00a01 is paralleled by Interstates: the remainder of I-85 to Petersburg, I-95 through Richmond and Fredericksburg to Alexandria, and I-395 into Arlington. In much of Virginia, US\u00a01 was called the Jefferson Davis Highway by state law, although there are exceptions. South of Petersburg, it is known as Boydton Plank Road. Through some of Fairfax County and Alexandria, it is called the Richmond Highway. In February 2021, Virginia renamed all remaining portions of the Jefferson Davis Highway in the state to Emancipation Highway beginning on January 1, 2022.\nUS\u00a01 crosses the Potomac River with I-395 on the 14th Street bridges and splits to follow mainly 14th Street and Rhode Island Avenue through the District of Columbia. US\u00a01 is at the minimum of three lanes (with alternate passing) from the North Carolina state line to Petersburg with occasional four-lane divided sections. North of Petersburg is a four-lane undivided roadway at the minimum to the DC line. The route of US\u00a01 from Petersburg to the state line is parallel with the Atlantic Seaboard Fall Line. From Petersburg onward, it is parallel with I-95. After exiting DC into Maryland, US\u00a01 follows the Baltimore\u2013Washington Boulevard, the first of several modern highways built along the Washington\u2013Baltimore combined statistical area corridor; I-95 is the newest, after the Baltimore\u2013Washington Parkway. US\u00a01 runs through the University of Maryland, College Park, campus in College Park, Maryland. The route bypasses Downtown Baltimore on North Avenue and exits the city to the northeast on Belair Road, gradually leaving the I-95 corridor, which passes through Wilmington, Delaware, for a straighter path toward Philadelphia. Around and beyond Bel Air, US\u00a01 is a two-lane road, crossing the Susquehanna River over the top of the Conowingo Dam before entering Pennsylvania. (Routed further north, US\u00a01 bypasses the state of Delaware, unlike I-95.)\nThe two-lane US\u00a01 becomes a four-lane expressway, officially known as the John H. Ware III Memorial Highway, after the Pennsylvania representative, just after crossing into Pennsylvania. This bypass extends around Oxford and Kennett Square, merging into the four-lane divided Baltimore Pike just beyond the latter. At Media, US\u00a01 again becomes a freeway\u2014the Media Bypass\u2014ending just beyond I-476. After several name changes, the road becomes City Avenue, the western city limits of Philadelphia, at the end of which a short overlap with I-76 leads to the Roosevelt Expressway and then the 12-lane Roosevelt Boulevard partly overlapping US\u00a013. US\u00a01 again becomes a freeway after leaving the city, bypassing Penndel and Morrisville and crossing the Delaware River into New Jersey on the Trenton\u2013Morrisville Toll Bridge.\nAfter crossing into New Jersey in Mercer County, US\u00a01 continues on the Trenton Freeway through the state capital of Trenton and Lawrence Township as a four-lane freeway. As the freeway ends, the four-lane divided highway upgrades to six lanes north of I-295 passing through the Penns Neck section of West Windsor. Through Penns Neck is a series of traffic signals. The New Jersey Department of Transportation (NJDOT) is looking to revamp the highway through this area by replacing traffic signals with grade separations. The highway enters Middlesex County through Plainsboro Township and South Brunswick, where the highest point resides. By Forrestal Village, the highway downgrades from six to four lanes until after Finnegans Lane in North Brunswick. Northward, it continues through New Brunswick as a short limited-access highway until the County Route\u00a0529 (CR\u00a0529)/Plainfield Avenue traffic signal in Edison. Through Edison and Woodbridge Township, US\u00a01 has a mix of boulevard and limited-access segments and continues to do so after the US\u00a09 juncture in the Avenel section of Woodbridge. The US\u00a01/9 concurrency continues through the rest of the state. The six-lane divided highway remains through Rahway in Union County and Elizabeth, until it reaches Newark Liberty International Airport, where it becomes a dual carriageway freeway around downtown Newark in Essex County with a 2\u20132\u20132\u20132 configuration. The historic Pulaski Skyway takes US\u00a01/9 into Jersey City, and the route exits the freeway at the Tonnele Circle to head north into Bergen County. US\u00a01/9 turns onto US\u00a046 as a limited-access highway, and the three routes run northeast to the George Washington Bridge Plaza, where they merge into I-95. US\u00a046 ends in the middle of the bridge, which crosses the Hudson River into New York, and US\u00a09 exits just beyond onto Broadway in Manhattan, but US\u00a01 stays with I-95 onto the Cross Bronx Expressway, exiting in the Bronx onto Webster Avenue. Two turns take US\u00a01 via Fordham Road to Boston Road, which it follows northeast out of the city, becoming Boston Post Road in Westchester County, never straying far from I-95. From the Bronx to the state line, it is a local road with two lanes in each direction, except in Rye where it has a single lane in each direction. As it enters Greenwich, Connecticut, it continues as a two-lane local road.\nNew England.\nIn New England, US\u00a01 generally serves large cities in a side street capacity. In Connecticut, US\u00a01 serves the shore of Long Island Sound parallel to I-95. Beyond New Haven, the highway travels east\u2013west, and some signs in the state indicate this rather than the standard north\u2013south. While I-95 in Rhode Island takes a diagonal path to Providence, US\u00a01 continues east along the coast through Westerly to Wakefield-Peacedale, where it turns north and follows Narragansett Bay. Most of this part is a four-lane limited-access highway, providing access to Route\u00a0138 toward Newport. After Route\u00a04 splits as a mostly-freeway connection to I-95, US\u00a01 becomes a lower-speed surface road, passing through Warwick, Providence, and Pawtucket. The route parallels I-95 again through Providence and Pawtucket and into Massachusetts, traveling toward Boston as a four-lane road. When it reaches Dedham, US\u00a01 turns east and becomes a freeway through metropolitan Boston, concurrent with I-95 and I-93 east to Braintree and north through Downtown Boston. The Tobin Bridge and Northeast Expressway take US\u00a01 out of Boston, after which it again parallels I-95 as a high-speed surface road through Newburyport to the New Hampshire state line.\nThe short portion of US\u00a01 in New Hampshire follows the historic Lafayette Road, staying close to I-95, passing through Portsmouth before crossing the Piscataqua River on Memorial Bridge, which was demolished and replaced during 2012\u20132013, leaving a temporary gap in US\u00a01. During construction, drivers had to detour to one of two other nearby bridges carrying US\u00a01 Bypass or I-95. Within Maine, US\u00a01 begins as a parallel route to I-95 near the Atlantic Ocean. At Portland, I-95 splits off to the north, and I-295 heads northeast paralleling US\u00a01 to Brunswick. There US\u00a01 turns east as a mostly two-lane road along the coast to Calais; much of this portion is advertised as the \"Coastal Route\" on signs. North from Calais, US\u00a01 follows the Canadian border, crossing I-95 in Houlton and eventually turning west and southwest to its \"north\" end at the Clair\u2013Fort Kent Bridge in Fort Kent. On the New Brunswick (Canada) side of the bridge, Route\u00a0205 extends south and west to Saint-Fran\u00e7ois-de-Madawaska, while the short Route\u00a0161 extends north to Route\u00a0120, a secondary east\u2013west route from Edmundston, New Brunswick, west to Quebec Route 289 toward Saint-Alexandre-de-Kamouraska, Quebec.\nHistory.\nThe direct predecessor to US\u00a01 was the Atlantic Highway, an auto trail established in 1911 as the Quebec\u2013Miami International Highway. In 1915, it was renamed the Atlantic Highway, and the northern terminus was changed to Calais, Maine. Due to the overlapping of auto trail designations, portions of the route had other names that remain in common use, such as the Boston Post Road between Boston and New York City, the Lincoln Highway between New York and Philadelphia, the Baltimore Pike between Philadelphia and Baltimore, and the Dixie Highway in and south of eastern Georgia. North of Augusta, Georgia, the highway generally followed the Atlantic Seaboard Fall Line, rather than a more easterly route through the swamps of the Atlantic Plain. Brickell Avenue is the name given to the stretch of US\u00a01 in Miami, Florida, just south of the Miami River until the Rickenbacker Causeway.\nWhen the New England road marking system was established in 1922, the Atlantic Highway within New England was signed as Route\u00a01, with a Route\u00a024 continuing north to Madawaska; New York extended the number to New York City in 1924 with its own Route\u00a01. Other states adopted their own systems of numbering; by 1926 all states but Maryland had signed the Atlantic Highway as various routes, usually changing numbers at the state line. In 1925, the Joint Board on Interstate Highways created a preliminary list of interstate routes to be marked by the states, including US\u00a01 along the Atlantic. This highway began at Fort Kent, Maine, and followed the existing Route\u00a024 to Houlton, as well as Route\u00a015 to Bangor, beyond which it generally followed the Atlantic Highway to Miami. In all states but Georgia that had numbered their state highways, Route\u00a01 followed only one or two numbers across the state. The only significant deviation from the Atlantic Highway was between Augusta, Georgia, and Jacksonville, Florida, where Route\u00a01 was assigned to a more inland route, rather than following the Atlantic Highway via Savannah.\nOne of the many changes made to the system before the final numbering was adopted in 1926 involved US\u00a01 in Maine. The 1925 plan had assigned US\u00a01 to the shorter inland route (Route\u00a015) between Houlton and Bangor, while US\u00a02 followed the longer coastal route via Calais. In the system as adopted in 1926, US\u00a02 instead took the inland route, while US\u00a01 followed the coast, absorbing all of the former Route\u00a024 and Route\u00a01 in New England. Many local and regional relocations, often onto parallel superhighways, were made in the early days of US\u00a01; this included the four-lane divided Route\u00a025 in New Jersey, completed in 1932 with the opening of the Pulaski Skyway, and a bypass of Bangor involving the Waldo\u2013Hancock Bridge, opened in 1931. The Overseas Highway from Miami to Key West was completed in 1938 and soon became a southern extension of US\u00a01.\nWith the construction of the Interstate Highway System in and after the 1950s, much of US\u00a01 from Houlton to Miami was bypassed by I-95. Between Houlton and Brunswick, Maine, I-95 took a shorter inland route, much of it paralleling US\u00a02 on the alignment proposed for US\u00a01 in 1925. Between Philadelphia and Baltimore, I-95 leaves US\u00a01 to pass through Wilmington. Most notably, I-95 and US\u00a01 follow different corridors between Petersburg, Virginia, and Jacksonville, Florida; while US\u00a01 followed the Atlantic Seaboard Fall Line west of the coastal plain, I-95 takes a more direct route through the plain and its swamps. Although some of this part of US\u00a01 was followed by other Interstates\u2014I-85 between Petersburg and Henderson, North Carolina, and I-20 between Camden, South Carolina, and Augusta, Georgia\u2014the rest remains an independent route with four lanes in many places. By the late 1970s, most of I-95 had been completed, replacing US\u00a01 as the main corridor of the east coast and relegating most of it to local road status.\n Whitehead Street and Fleming Street in Key West\n in Florida City\n in Miami\n in Miami\n in Miami\n in Miami\n in Miami\n on the Dania Beach\u2013Fort Lauderdale, Florida city line\n in West Palm Beach\n in Melbourne\n in Daytona Beach\n in Ormond Beach\n near Palm Coast\n in Jacksonville\n in Jacksonville\n in Jacksonville.

At , it is the longest state route in California, and the second-longest in the US after Montana Highway 200. SR\u00a01 has several portions designated as either Pacific Coast Highway (PCH), Cabrillo Highway, Shoreline Highway, or Coast Highway. Its southern terminus is at Interstate 5 (I-5) near Dana Point in Orange County and its northern terminus is at U.S. Route 101 (US\u00a0101) near Leggett in Mendocino County. SR\u00a01 also at times runs concurrently with US\u00a0101, most notably through a stretch in Ventura and Santa Barbara counties, and across the Golden Gate Bridge.\nThe highway is designated as an All-American Road. In addition to providing a scenic route to numerous attractions along the coast, the route also serves as a major thoroughfare in the Greater Los Angeles Area, the San Francisco Bay Area, and several other coastal urban areas. Though some maps and signs mark SR\u00a01 as continuous through the cities of Dana Point, Newport Beach, Santa Monica, and Oxnard, control of segments within those cities were relinquished to those local jurisdictions and are thus no longer officially part of the state highway system. The Golden Gate Bridge is also officially not included in the state highway system because it is maintained locally by the Golden Gate Bridge, Highway and Transportation District.\nSR\u00a01 was built piecemeal in various stages, with the first section opening in the Big Sur region in the 1930s. However, portions of the route had several names and numbers over the years as more segments opened. It was not until the 1964 state highway renumbering that the entire route was officially designated as SR\u00a01. Although SR\u00a01 is a popular route for its scenery, frequent landslides and erosion along the coast have caused several segments to be either closed for lengthy periods for repairs, or re-routed inland.\nRoute description.\nDue to its fragmented nature and piecemeal relinquishments, the California Streets and Highways Code defines Route 1 across several subdivisions of section 301 as follows:\nRoute 1 is from:\n(a) Route\u00a05 south of San Juan Capistrano to Route 101 near El Rio except for the portions of Route 1 relinquished:\n(b) Route 101 at Emma Wood State Beach, 1.3 miles north of Route 33, to Route 101, 2.8 miles south of the Ventura-Santa Barbara county line at Mobil Pier Undercrossing.(c) Route 101 near Las Cruces to Route 101 in Pismo Beach via the vicinity of Lompoc, Vandenberg Air Force Base, and Guadalupe.(d) Route 101 in San Luis Obispo to Route 280 south of San Francisco along the coast via Cambria, San Simeon, and Santa Cruz.(e) Route 280 near the south boundary of the City and County of San Francisco to Route 101 near the approach to the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco.(f) Route 101 near the southerly end of Marin Peninsula to Route 101 near Leggett via the coast route through Jenner and Westport.\nThe definition omits Route 1's concurrencies with Routes 101 and 280 instead of duplicating those segments in the other routes' definitions in the code. And while the former portions of Route 1 have been relinquished by the state to the cities of Dana Point, Newport Beach, Santa Monica, and Oxnard, section 301 subdivision (g) further mandates that those cities must still \"maintain within their respective jurisdictions signs directing motorists to the continuation of Route 1\". In addition to the relinquished portions listed under subdivision (a), sections 301 subdivision (h), 301.1, 301.3, 303.4 and 301.5 of the code permit the state to relinquish select or all portions of Route 1 in the cities of Los Angeles, Torrance, Newport Beach, Laguna Beach and Pismo Beach respectively.\nSR\u00a01 is part of the California Freeway and Expressway System, and through the Los Angeles metro area, Monterey, Santa Cruz, and San Francisco metro area is part of the National Highway System, a network of highways that are considered essential to the country's economy, defense, and mobility by the Federal Highway Administration.\nThe Big Sur section from San Luis Obispo to Carmel is an official National Scenic Byway. SR\u00a01 is eligible to be included in the State Scenic Highway System; however, only a few stretches between Los Angeles and San Francisco have officially been designated as a scenic highway, meaning that there are substantial sections of highway passing through a \"memorable landscape\" with no \"visual intrusions\", where the potential designation has gained popular favor with the community.\nThe entire route is designated as a Blue Star Memorial Highway to recognize those in the United States armed forces; this designation is sponsored by the California Garden Clubs, but the organization has not erected such markers along SR\u00a01 yet. In 1959, the legislature officially designated the segment in Southern California between Interstate 5 (I-5) in Dana Point and US\u00a0101 near Oxnard as the Pacific Coast Highway (commonly referred to as \"PCH\", without the definite article \"the\", unlike other freeway numbers in the Los Angeles area). Between US\u00a0101 at the Las Cruces junction ( south of Buellton) and US\u00a0101 in Pismo Beach, and between US\u00a0101 in San Luis Obispo and Interstate 280 in San Francisco, the legislature also designated SR\u00a01 as the Cabrillo Highway in 1959, after the explorer Juan Rodr\u00edguez Cabrillo who sailed along the coast line. The legislature also designated the route as the Shoreline Highway in 1957 between the Manzanita Junction near Marin City and Leggett. Smaller segments of the highway have been assigned several other names by the state and municipal governments.\nFor the most part, SR\u00a01 runs parallel to the coastline, or close to it, but does turn several miles inland at various locations to avoid several federally controlled or protected areas such as Vandenberg Space Force Base, Diablo Canyon Power Plant and Point Reyes National Seashore. In addition to connecting the coastal cities and communities along its path, the route provides access to beaches, parks, and other attractions along the coast, making it a popular route for tourists. The route annually helps bring several billion dollars to the state's tourism industry. Segments of SR\u00a01 range from urban freeway to simple rural two-lane road. Under the California Coastal Act, those segments of the highway that run through the rural areas of the protected California Coastal Zone may not be widened beyond a scenic two-lane road.\nOrange County.\nAt its southernmost end in Orange County, SR\u00a01 terminates at I-5 in Capistrano Beach in Dana Point. It then travels west into the city center. After leaving Dana Point, Pacific Coast Highway (PCH) becomes simply \"Coast Highway\" while at the same time continuing northwest along the coast through Laguna Beach (where it meets the southern terminus of SR\u00a0133) and Crystal Cove State Park.\nSR\u00a01 then enters Newport Beach and passes through several affluent neighborhoods, including Newport Coast and Corona Del Mar, spans the entrance to the Upper Newport Bay, which marks the boundary between East Coast Highway and West Coast Highway, and crosses California State Route 55 near its southern terminus. Upon crossing the Santa Ana River mouth and entering Huntington Beach, SR\u00a01 regains the Pacific Coast Highway designation. It passes Huntington State Beach and the southern terminus of California State Route 39 before reaching Bolsa Chica State Beach and the Bolsa Chica Ecological Reserve. PCH then continues along the coast into Seal Beach, the final city on its journey in Orange County.\nLos Angeles and Ventura counties.\nPCH enters Los Angeles County and the city of Long Beach after crossing the San Gabriel River. SR\u00a01 then continues northwest through the city to its junction with Lakewood Boulevard (State Route 19) and Los Coyotes Diagonal at the Los Alamitos Circle, more than from the coast. From the traffic circle, it continues inland west through Long Beach, including approximately one mile adjacent to the southern boundary of Signal Hill. PCH is marked as such in Long Beach, but originally bore the name of Hathaway Avenue east of the traffic circle and State Street west of there. PCH then passes through the Los Angeles districts of Wilmington and Harbor City. While bypassing the immediate coastline of Palos Verdes, SR\u00a01 continues to head west into the cities of Lomita and Torrance along the route of the former Redondo-Wilmington Boulevard.\nPCH then turns north through Redondo Beach and Hermosa Beach. Upon entering Manhattan Beach, it becomes Sepulveda Boulevard and turns back into PCH designation through El Segundo. At Imperial Highway, it regains the name Sepulveda Boulevard as it descends and passes under two runways of Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) via the Sepulveda Boulevard Tunnel.\nAfter leaving LAX, SR\u00a01 splits from Sepulveda and turns northwest, becoming Lincoln Boulevard and passing through the Los Angeles neighborhoods of Westchester, Playa Vista, and Venice, as well as the unincorporated community of Marina Del Rey. This portion of SR 1 suffers heavy congestion at most times due to the shortage of alternate north-south arterial roads west of Interstate 405. It then enters the city of Santa Monica, where SR\u00a01 turns southwest, merging onto the westernmost segment of the Santa Monica Freeway. Passing through the McClure Tunnel (which also serves as the national western terminus of Interstate 10), SR\u00a01 emerges along the beachfront in Santa Monica as PCH again and continues along the coast, separated from Downtown Santa Monica by the palisades north of Santa Monica Pier; this portion is also known locally as Palisades Beach Road and formerly as Roosevelt Highway. Upon leaving Santa Monica, PCH continues to follow the coast, curving west through the Pacific Palisades neighborhood of Los Angeles before becoming the main thoroughfare of the city of Malibu while traversing the entire of that city.\nSR\u00a01 crosses the county line and continues through the Ventura County portion of the Malibu coast through Leo Carrillo State Park and Point Mugu State Park. After passing through a notch in the promontory that marks Point Mugu, the western end of the Santa Monica Mountains, and the beginning of the Oxnard Plain. The road cut left a very large rock formation at the tip of the point that is called the Mugu Rock. At that point, PCH leaves the coast and heads north, and then northwest as a freeway along the northeastern boundary of Naval Base Ventura County Point Mugu for several miles to an interchange at Rice Avenue, Pleasant Valley Road, and Oxnard Boulevard in Oxnard. The reconstructed interchange at Rice Avenue and Pleasant Valley Road channels traffic north on the surface street, Rice Avenue, towards the interchange with US\u00a0101. The historic route along Oxnard Boulevard was relinquished in 2014. Truck traffic to and from the Port of Hueneme also uses this designated route at the Rice Avenue/Hueneme Road connector to connect with Route 101 at the Rice Avenue Interchange.\nAfter traveling through Ventura, SR\u00a01 separates from US\u00a0101 to travel the historic beach route along the Rincon coast that was originally opened up by the construction of the Railroad Coastal Route from Emma Wood State Beach to the Mobil Pier Undercrossing near Sea Cliff, where it rejoins US\u00a0101 about south of the Santa Barbara County line near La Conchita.\nCentral Coast.\nThe US\u00a0101/SR\u00a01 concurrency (although actual signage mentioning SR\u00a01 through this segment is nonexistent) from the Mobil Pier Undercrossing runs for , passing through the City of Santa Barbara and its neighboring communities along the coast of Santa Barbara County. The route then turns away from the Gaviota Coast at Gaviota State Beach, avoiding Point Conception, and heads due north through Gaviota State Park and the Gaviota Tunnel. In Las Cruces, SR\u00a01, now named Cabrillo Highway, splits again from US\u00a0101 and heads northwest to the city of Lompoc. It is briefly joined with SR\u00a0246 along Lompoc's east\u2013west Ocean Avenue, before turning north as H Street to Harris Grade Road, where it then regains the Cabrillo Highway name.\nAfter reaching the main entrance to Vandenberg Space Force Base, SR\u00a01 turns northeast, away from the immediate coastline of the base, to join SR\u00a0135. SR\u00a0135 then splits from SR\u00a01 south of Orcutt, and the Cabrillo Highway turns northwest back towards the coast to Guadalupe. It enters San Luis Obispo County, avoiding the immediate coastline of the protected Guadalupe-Nipomo Dunes, before passing through Grover Beach and subsequently joining US\u00a0101 for the third time at Pismo Beach. The US\u00a0101/SR\u00a01 concurrency then avoids the immediate coastline of Avila Beach and Diablo Canyon Power Plant, and instead heads straight inland to San Luis Obispo.\nSR\u00a01 splits from US\u00a0101 at Santa Rosa Street in San Luis Obispo and then resumes as a four-lane road as the Cabrillo Highway. It rejoins the coast in Morro Bay, running through that city as a freeway, where it crosses Morro Creek at the site of a prehistoric Chumash settlement dating to the Millingstone Horizon. From there, SR\u00a01 proceeds north to Cayucos until it again becomes a winding, two-lane road with occasional passing lanes. It then continues along the coast through Cambria and San Simeon, and past the elephant seal colony at Piedras Blancas Light Station. SR\u00a01 provides access to Hearst Castle in San Simeon in Northern San Luis Obispo County.\nBig Sur.\nSR\u00a01 then enters the Big Sur region, crossing San Carp\u00f3foro Creek just south of the Monterey County line. For about from San Carp\u00f3foro Creek to Malpaso Creek, the road winds and hugs the cliffs of Big Sur, passing various coastal parks in the area, with no connection to the other side of the Santa Lucia Mountains except for Nacimiento-Fergusson Road. The road briefly leaves the coast for a few miles, passing through a redwood forest in the Big Sur River valley. The Big Sur segment of the highway, built between 1919 and 1937, also crosses a number of historic bridges, including the scenic Bixby Bridge, a reinforced concrete arch with a span that passes over the Bixby Creek gorge, the Rocky Creek Bridge, and the Big Creek Bridge. The segment of SR 1 through Big Sur is \"considered one of the most beautiful drives in the world\" and \"attracts tourists from all over the world\".\nMonterey Bay Area.\nAfter crossing the Carmel River, SR\u00a01 turns inland and runs along the eastern boundary of Carmel and the western boundary of Carmel Valley before becoming a freeway in Monterey. After bypassing the immediate coastline of Pebble Beach and the rest of the Monterey Peninsula, the freeway heads north along the coast of Monterey Bay through Sand City, Seaside, and Marina. At the interchange with SR\u00a0156 near Castroville, SR\u00a01 continues north as a two-lane rural road to Moss Landing.\nSR\u00a01 becomes a freeway once again just before entering into Santa Cruz County. This four-lane freeway continues up the Monterey Bay coast through Watsonville to its interchange with SR\u00a017 in Santa Cruz. (This trumpet interchange is locally known as The Fishhook due to its tight loop ramps that resemble a fishhook when viewed from above). After a short expressway section, it skirts downtown Santa Cruz as four-lane Mission Street, regaining the Cabrillo Highway designation (local/historic name is \"Coast Road\") after it leaves the city and continues north-west as a two-lane road (with occasional four-lane sections) up the coast through Davenport.\nSan Francisco Bay Area.\nEntering San Mateo County, SR\u00a01 follows the west coast of the San Francisco Peninsula, passing by the marine mammal colonies at A\u00f1o Nuevo State Park, and the historic Pigeon Point Lighthouse, before reaching Half Moon Bay. Between Half Moon Bay and Pacifica, the highway bypasses a treacherous stretch known as Devil's Slide via the Tom Lantos Tunnels.\nSR\u00a01 then becomes a freeway once again at Sharp Park in Pacifica before turning inland to join Interstate 280 in Daly City. Just short of reaching the City and County of San Francisco, SR\u00a01 splits from Interstate 280, where the road becomes Junipero Serra Boulevard. Shortly thereafter, the highway makes a slight left, becoming the six-lane wide 19th Avenue; the San Francisco Municipal Railway's M Ocean View streetcar line runs in the median from this point until a junction to a rail only right-of-way near Rossmoor Drive. SR\u00a01 then turns into Park Presidio Boulevard after it passes through the city's Golden Gate Park. Then after entering the Presidio of San Francisco, it goes through the MacArthur Tunnel before joining US\u00a0101 for a fourth time on the approach to the Golden Gate Bridge known as Doyle Drive.\nAfter crossing the bridge and entering Marin County, SR\u00a01 then splits from US\u00a0101 again near Marin City, where it leaves the city and, as the Shoreline Highway, returns to a winding, two lane road as it passes over the Marin Hills to rejoin the coast at Muir Beach. After passing Stinson Beach and the Bolinas Lagoon, SR\u00a01 avoids the immediate coastline of Point Reyes National Seashore and the rest of the Point Reyes Peninsula, and instead heads towards, and then along, the eastern shore of Tomales Bay.\nLeaving Tomales Bay, SR\u00a01 heads further inland to intersect with Valley Ford Road just north of the Sonoma County border. It then rejoins the coast in Bodega Bay, where its name changes to Coast Highway past the Sonoma Coast State Beaches. After bridging the Russian River at Jenner, SR\u00a01 continues to wind along the rugged coast to Fort Ross, Salt Point State Parks, and the planned community of Sea Ranch.\nMendocino County.\nSR\u00a01 then crosses the Gualala River and enters Mendocino County. The highway enters the city of Point Arena, in which it becomes Main Street, before following School Street to the northwest and then becoming Shoreline Highway once again. It bridges the Garcia River and then, near Elk, the Navarro River, where it meets SR\u00a0128.\nAt the town of Albion, the Albion River is spanned by the Albion River Bridge, the only remaining wooden trestle bridge on the highway. SR\u00a01 then passes through Little River and Van Damme State Park, crosses Big River and passes through Mendocino Headlands State Park and the Victorian community of Mendocino. Continuing north, SR\u00a01 crosses Russian Gulch State Park on the Frederick W. Panhorst Bridge, and passes through the town of Caspar. It passes through a roundabout just south of the intersection with the western terminus of SR\u00a020, where it widens to two lanes, then bridges the Noyo River at Noyo, becomes Main Street of Fort Bragg, and crosses the California Western Railroad.\nNorth of Fort Bragg as a two-lane highway again, SR\u00a01 passes MacKerricher State Park and the towns of Cleone and Inglenook before crossing Ten Mile River. After passing Westport-Union Landing State Beach, the road goes through a series of redwood-forested switchbacks before reaching Rockport. North of Rockport, the highway turns away from the Lost Coast to avoid steep and unstable highlands created by Mendocino triple junction uplift. The highway follows Cottaneva Creek inland through redwood-forested mountainous terrain before terminating at US\u00a0101 just outside Leggett.\nHistory.\nSR\u00a01 has become famous worldwide, but the highway was signed as several other routes prior to 1964. When the road was first envisioned in the World War I era, California highways were referred to by either a highway name or a route number. The route numbers were used by state highway planners and the Legislature from 1915 until 1964, but were never posted on highways, referred to by the auto clubs or public, nor used on maps. The SR\u00a01 designation was first assigned in 1939. Various portions of SR\u00a01 have been posted and referred to by various names and numbers over the years. State construction of what became SR\u00a01 started after the state's third highway bond issue passed before 1910.\nSegments initially constructed.\nEager for a direct coastal route between Ventura and Santa Barbara, civic boosters used locally raised funds to begin building the Rincon Sea Level Road in 1911. The route between the Ventura River and Carpinteria had been an unimproved route along small alluvial fan beaches that skirted coastal bluff rock outcroppings at low tide. Construction of the Southern Pacific Coast Line railroad had created a road flanked by riprap along this area. In order to make this part of the first coastal route for motorists driving from San Francisco to Los Angeles, they paved the road and built wooden causeways where the route flooded from the ocean waves. Local funding ran out, but the newly formed State Highway Commission took over and completed the road in 1913.\nOne of the most difficult routes to build was along the Big Sur coast. The state first approved building Route 56, or the Carmel-San Simeon Highway, to connect Big Sur to the rest of California in 1919. Federal funds were appropriated and in 1921 voters approved additional state funds. San Quentin State Prison set up three temporary prison camps to provide unskilled convict labor to help with road construction. One was set up by Little Sur River, one at Kirk Creek and a third was later established in the south at Anderson Creek. Inmates were paid 35 cents per day and had their prison sentences reduced in return. The route necessitated construction of 33 bridges, the largest of which was the Bixby Bridge. Six more concrete arch bridges were built between Point Sur and Carmel.\nAfter 18 years of construction, aided by New Deal funds during the Great Depression, the paved two-lane road was completed and opened on June 17, 1937. The road was initially called the Carmel-San Simeon Highway (Route 56), but was better known as the Roosevelt Highway, honoring the current President Franklin D. Roosevelt. A 1921 law extended Route 56 south over the county road to Cambria.\nRoute 60, from Oxnard via the coast to San Juan Capistrano, was extended from Oxnard to El Rio (midway to Ventura, now the site of the Oxnard Boulevard interchange with US\u00a0101), in 1925. At Point Mugu, a path for the highway was cut through the mountains using surplus World War I explosives, thus creating Mugu Rock. The 1921 legislation, in theory, made Route 60 a continuous coastal loop, with both ends at what became US\u00a0101 in Oxnard and at Capistrano Beach (since 1964 the southern terminus of SR\u00a01 at Interstate 5 in Orange County). Route 56 was extended further south from Cambria to connect to present-day US\u00a0101 in San Luis Obispo in 1931.\nThe route from San Simeon to Carmel (connecting with existing county highways at each end) was one of two sections designated as SR\u00a01. It and Route 60 were intended as links in a continuous coastal roadway from Oregon to Mexico,\nA large expansion of the state highway system in 1933 resulted in Route 56 being extended in both directions. To the south, a second section was added, beginning at Pismo Beach on US\u00a0101 (Route 2) and heading south through Guadalupe and Lompoc to rejoin US\u00a0101 at a junction called Los Cruces (sic), just north of Gaviota Pass. (A short piece near Orcutt and Los Alamos had been part of Route 2, which originally followed present SR\u00a0135 from Los Alamos to Santa Maria.) To the north, Route 56 was continued along the coast from Carmel through Santa Cruz to San Francisco. Several discontinuous pieces were added north of San Francisco, one from Route 1 (US\u00a0101) north of the Golden Gate to the county line near Valley Ford, another from the Russian River near Jenner (where the new Route 104 ended) to Westport, and a third from Ferndale to Route 1 near Fernbridge. Except for the gaps in Route 56 north of San Francisco, these additions completed the coastal highway, with other sections formed by Routes 1, 2, and 71.\nThe section of SR\u00a01 from Santa Monica to Oxnard, via Malibu, went out to contract in 1925 as \"Coast Boulevard\", but was designated \"Theodore Roosevelt Highway\" when it was dedicated in 1929. Before the completion of its present alignment in 1937, a narrow, winding, steep road known as Pedro Mountain Road connected Montara with Pacifica. That highway was completed in 1914 and provided competition to the Ocean Shore Railroad, which operated between San Francisco and Tunitas Creek from 1907 to 1920. SR\u00a01 also used to run along the coast between Pacifica and Daly City, but this segment was damaged and rendered unusable after a 5.3 magnitude earthquake on March 22, 1957. A small stub remains near Thornton Beach.\nRoute 56 along Big Sur was incorporated into the state highway system and re-designated as SR\u00a01 in 1939. The section of road along the Big Sur Coast was declared the first State Scenic Highway in 1965, and in 1966 the first lady, Lady Bird Johnson, led the official designation ceremony at Bixby Bridge. The route was designated as an All American Road by the US Government.\nSigns first posted.\nSR\u00a01 signs first went up after California decided to number its highways, in 1934. The section for Humboldt, Mendocino, Sonoma, Marin, San Francisco, San Mateo, Santa Cruz, Monterey, San Luis Obispo and Santa Barbara counties was posted as SR\u00a01, that section of the road known Route 56 (Las Cruces to Fernbridge). For Ventura, Los Angeles and Orange counties, Route 60 (San Juan Capistrano to the Oxnard area) became SR\u00a03, and a few SR\u00a03 signs were actually posted. The SR\u00a03 signs were replaced by US\u00a0101 Alt. shields by 1936, as the road was built out; this change also allowed the extension of US\u00a066 to end at another U.S. Route, in Santa Monica.\nThe gaps of non-state highway along the northern coast were finally filled in by the Legislature in 1951, though the State Department of Public Works was not required to maintain the newly added portions immediately. A connection from near Rockport to Legislative Route\u00a01 (signed US\u00a0101) at Leggett was also added to the Legislative Route 56 definition, as the existing county road north from Rockport to Ferndale had not yet been paved.\nA portion of the road heading to the Golden Gate Bridge was widened to four lanes as part of a project competed in 1954.&lt;ref name=\"nps.gov/28371/D\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;\nThe state Legislature in 1963 tossed out the old conflicting Legislative Route Numbers (1964 renumbering), got rid of some famous old U.S. routes, and renumbered many state highways. It abolished US\u00a0101A in Los Angeles, Orange and Ventura counties and renumbered it as SR\u00a01. The Rockport to Leggett connection then became State Route 208. The cover of \"California Highways\" magazine in fall 1964 shows state engineers posting the new shield at Point Mugu. The same year, the Legislature by state law named SR\u00a01 \"Pacific Coast Highway\" in Orange, Los Angeles and Ventura counties, \"Cabrillo Highway\" from Santa Barbara north to San Francisco, and \"Shoreline Highway\" from Marin County to its northern terminus. Many cities, however, did not change the name of city streets that are part of SR\u00a01, such as Lincoln and Sepulveda boulevards in Los Angeles, Santa Monica and El Segundo; and Junipero Serra and Park Presidio boulevards in San Francisco. Several other cities and communities like Newport Beach, Laguna Beach and Bodega Bay merely named their respective city streets as \"Coast Highway\".\nModern alignments.\nThe freeway portion of SR\u00a01 from Highway 68 in Monterey to Munras Avenue opened in 1956\u20131960. The segment from Munras Avenue to the northern border of Sand City and Seaside opened in 1968, and bypasses the original highway alignment of Munras Avenue and Fremont Street in Monterey, and Fremont Boulevard through Seaside. North of Seaside, the freeway was built over the original SR\u00a01 alignment through Fort Ord in 1973. North of Fort Ord, SR\u00a01 now veers to the left of the original alignment and bypasses Marina to the west. This segment including the interchange with SR\u00a0156 and the short, 2-lane Castroville Bypass opened in 1976. Originally SR\u00a01 followed the SR\u00a0156 alignment to the SR\u00a0183 intersection in Castroville, then turned northwest, following the present-day SR\u00a0183 through Castroville before rejoining its existing alignment at the northern terminus of the Castroville Bypass.\nPlans to upgrade SR\u00a01 to a freeway from its southern terminus all the way to Oxnard, including building an offshore causeway from the Santa Monica Pier to Topanga Canyon Boulevard south of Malibu, were ultimately killed by 1971 due to local opposition. In 1980, another section was added northwest of Ventura near Emma Wood State Beach, when several miles of the old two-lane alignment of U.S. Route 101 were posted as SR\u00a01 where the freeway had bypassed it in about 1960. Then in 1988, the segment from Purisima Road in Lompoc to SR\u00a0135 was re-routed from Harris Grade Road to the former County Route S20 so it could directly serve Vandenberg Air Force Base.\nConstruction to bridge the gap in the Lost Coast region between Rockport and Ferndale was eventually abandoned. The steepness and related geotechnical challenges of the coastal mountains made this stretch of coastline too costly for highway builders to establish routes through the area. In 1984, SR\u00a01 was then re-routed to replace State Highway 208, connecting Rockport and Leggett, while the segment between Ferndale and Fernbridge was renumbered as State Highway 211. Most of the coastline in the area is now part of Sinkyone Wilderness State Park and the King Range National Conservation Area.\nThe roadway along Devil's Slide, south of Pacifica, became the site of frequent deadly crashes and roadway-closing landslides. Beginning in 1958, Caltrans supported a plan to construct an inland bypass over Montara Mountain as an alternate route, but was eventually opposed by community and environmental groups who supported a tunnel instead. After decades of legal disputes, the Federal Highway Administration ordered Caltrans in 1995 to re-evaluate the proposed tunnel. Then on November 5, 1996, San Mateo County voters approved Measure T to change the county's official preference from the bypass to the tunnel. Ground eventually broke in 2005, and the Tom Lantos Tunnels opened in April 2013.\nIn 2014, two-way traffic was restored along the original PCH segment from Copper Lantern to Blue Lantern streets in the Dana Point city center after 25 years of one-way operation. During that period, only northbound traffic had flowed along this section of PCH while southbound traffic had been diverted onto the parallel Del Prado Avenue.\nSR\u00a01 has never been planned to extend south into San Diego, or north into Crescent City, where I-5 (which replaced the US\u00a0101 designation and signage between Los Angeles and San Diego) and US\u00a0101 serve as the coastal highways in those areas, respectively.\nAs a cycling venue.\nFor the 1932 Summer Olympics, the segment of the SR\u00a01 between Oxnard and Santa Monica (then known as the Theodore Roosevelt Highway) hosted part of the road cycling events. Portions of SR\u00a01 have also hosted stages of the Tour of California.\nMaintenance.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;California's coastline is constantly changing and continually presents us with challenges. Through hard work and determination, we continue to keep this scenic highway open.\u2014\u200a\nLandslides.\nFrequent landslides and erosion along the coast have caused portions of SR\u00a01 to either be closed for long periods of time, or be re-routed entirely. Some of these include:\nFuture projects.\nIn 2014, Caltrans relinquished the portion of SR\u00a01 in Oxnard along Oxnard Boulevard. The plan is then for PCH between Pleasant Valley Road and US\u00a0101 to be re-routed from Oxnard Boulevard onto Rice Avenue. That segment of Rice Avenue includes a railroad grade crossing at 5th Avenue that was the site of the February 2015 Oxnard train derailment, which eventually led to one death and 29 injuries. This was the twelfth accident at the crossing in ten years. An overpass has been planned at that site for almost two decades, but funding has not been available in Ventura County for the estimated $35 million grade separation project. On July 12, 2023, the Ventura County Transportation Commission and the City of Oxnard received $15 million in state funding to build an overpass. The project was estimated to be completed by the fall of 2027. As of February 2025, $134.5 million has been invested in the project. Construction started on March 19, and is estimated to be completed in December 2029.\nIn 2015, a $20 million project was proposed to add over 150 safety improvements to the stretch of the highway in Malibu. This follows a string of fatal accidents in the area, including one involving Caitlyn Jenner that claimed another person's life.\nThe Calera Parkway project proposes to widen the non-freeway segment in Pacifica between the Rockaway Beach and Vallemar districts, but is facing opposition by local residents and environmentalists.\nMajor intersections.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nIn popular culture.\nTim Buckley's 1969 album Happy Sad includes a song with the title \"Love from Room 109 at the Islander (On Pacific Coast Highway)\".\nR &amp; B group Con Funk Shun released a song titled \"California 1\" on their 1981 album Con Funk Shun 7.\nIn 1999, the Red Hot Chili Peppers released a song titled \"Road Trippin'\" on the Californication album. It describes a surfing trip along the Big Sur portion of the highway.\nIn 2002, the Decemberists released a song titled \"California One/Youth and Beauty Brigade\" on their album Castaways and Cutouts.\nIn 2008, Old 97's released a song titled \"The One\" on their album Blame It on Gravity. The song reminisces about their early days as a band being flown from Texas out to Los Angeles to be courted by various big record company labels. In this delightful reimagining, the band ultimately decides it would be easier and more fun to become bank robbers instead, and they make their escape along this famous route (\"Let's take The One!\").\nIn 2012, the Beach Boys released a song titled \"Pacific Coast Highway\" on the album \"That's Why God Made the Radio\". Described by critics as \"introspective\", \"autumnal\", and \"hymnlike\", the song takes the perspective of an aged person driving down the highway during sunset as he reflects on his advancing years in life, deciding that he is more comfortable living alone.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

A metropolitan area usually comprises multiple principal cities, jurisdictions and municipalities: neighborhoods, townships, boroughs, cities, towns, exurbs, suburbs, counties, districts and even states and nations in areas like the eurodistricts. As social, economic and political institutions have changed, metropolitan areas have become key economic and political regions.In the United States, metropolitan areas are delineated around the core of a core based statistical area, which is defined as an urban area and includes central and outlying counties. In other countries metropolitan areas are sometimes anchored by one central city such as the Paris metropolitan area (Paris). In other cases, metropolitan areas contain multiple centers of equal or close to equal importance, especially in the United States; for example, the Dallas\u2013Fort Worth metropolitan area has eight principal cities. The Islamabad\u2013Rawalpindi metropolitan area in Pakistan, the Rhine-Ruhr in Germany, and the Randstad in The Netherlands are other examples.\nIn the United States, the concept of metropolitan statistical areas has gained prominence. The area of the Greater Washington metropolitan area is an example of statistically grouping independent cities and county areas from various states to form a larger city because of proximity, history, and recent urban convergence. Metropolitan areas may themselves be part of a greater megalopolis. For urban centres located outside metropolitan areas that generate a similar attraction at a smaller scale for a region, the concept of a regiopolis and a respective regiopolitan area, or regio, was introduced by German professors in 2006. In the United States, the term micropolitan statistical area is used.\nDefinition.\nA metropolitan area combines an urban agglomeration with the contiguous built-up areas, which are not necessarily urban in character but are closely bound to the center by employment or other commerce. These outlying zones are sometimes known as a commuter belt and may extend well beyond the urban zone to other political entities. For example, East Hampton, New York, on Long Island is considered part of the New York metropolitan area.\nIn 2020, the European Commission, the Food and Agriculture Organization, the United Nations Human Settlements Programme, the International Labour Organization, the OECD, and the World Bank have agreed on a common methodological framework for delimitation of urban and rural areas, which contains a definition of metropolitan areas called the Functional urban area. It is defined as a city and its commuting zone, which is a contiguous area of spatial units that have at least 15% of their employed residents working in the city.\nIn practice, the parameters of metropolitan areas, in both official and unofficial usage, are not consistent. Sometimes they are little different from an urban area, and in other cases, they cover broad regions that have little relation to a single urban settlement; comparative statistics for metropolitan areas should take this into account. The term metropolitan can also refer to a county-level municipal government structure, with some shared services between a central city and its suburbs, which may or may not include the entirety of a metropolitan area. Population figures given for one metro area can vary by millions.\nThere has been no significant change in the basic concept of metropolitan areas since its adoption in 1950, although significant changes in geographic distributions have occurred since then, and more are expected. Because of the fluidity of the term \"metropolitan statistical area\", the term used colloquially is more often \"metro service area\", \"metro area\", or \"MSA\", taken to include not only a city but also the surrounding suburban, exurban and sometimes rural areas, all of which the city is presumed to influence. A polycentric metropolitan area contains multiple urban agglomerations not connected by continuous development. In defining a metropolitan area, it is sufficient that a city or cities form a nucleus with which other areas have a high degree of integration.\nA metropolitan area is commonly known and characterized by a high concentration in service sector labor and enterprises. Macroeconomics views metropolitan areas as trade regions of economic significance.\nSince, presently, urban data are based on arbitrary definitions that vary from country to country and from year or census to the next, making them difficult to compare, an Urban Metric System (UMS) has been conceived that could correct the problem, since it allows computing the urban area limits and central points, and it can be applied in the same way to all past, present and future population and job distributions. \nIt is based on vector field calculations obtained by assuming that, in a given space, all inhabitants and jobs exert the same attractive force \"A\" and repulsive force \"R\". The net force (\"A\" - \"R\") exerted by each inhabitant or job is given by [1/(1 + \"d\")] - [1/( \"\u03b2\" + \"d\"/2)], where \"d\" = distance and \"\u03b2\" is the only parameter. \nUMS distinguishes the following types of urban areas, each type corresponding to a given value of \"\u03b2\":\nUMS has been applied to some Canadian cases since 2018, but the data presented in this article are still based on the various existing national definitions, which are disparate.\nList of metropolitan areas.\nAfrica.\nAlgeria.\nUrban population rate: 72% (2024).

Conversely, metropolitan municipalities in South Africa are defined as commonly governed areas of a metropolitan area. The largest such metropolitan municipal government entity in South Africa is the City of Johannesburg Metropolitan Municipality, which presided over nearly 5 million people as of 2016. However, the Greater Johannesburg metropolitan area houses roughly ten times the population of its core municipal city of Johannesburg, which contained 957,441 people as of the 2011 census.\nUrban population rate: 69% (2024).

These metropolitan areas are separated into three main geographical areas; Metro Manila (which is located in Luzon), Metro Cebu (which is located in Visayas), Metro Davao (which is located in Mindanao), and Greater Manila Area (which is the largest metropolitan area of Manila). The official definition of each area does not necessarily follow the actual extent of continuous urbanization. For example, the built-up area of Metro Manila has long spilled out of its officially defined borders into the adjacent provinces of Bulacan, Rizal, Laguna, and Cavite known as Greater Manila Area. The number of metropolitan areas in the Philippines was reduced from 13 in 2007 to the current three based from the 2017\u20132022 Philippine Development Plan by NEDA. The other 10 metropolitan areas were Metro Angeles, Metro Bacolod, Metro Baguio, Metro Batangas, Metro Cagayan de Oro, Metro Dagupan, Metro Iloilo\u2013Guimaras, Metro Butuan, Metro Naga, and Metro Olongapo.\nUrban population rate: 59% (2024).

There are 30 officially defined \"metropolitan municipalities\" in Turkey. This classification, however, is only used for administrative purposes, and sometimes contradicts the colloquial use of the term \"metro area\". As an example, Gebze, a district in Kocaeli province and thus in the jurisdiction of the Kocaeli Metropolitan Municipality, is arguably within the metro area of Istanbul with many of its residents commuting to Istanbul for work and the Marmaray, a commuter rail line, extending into the district. The district however, as previously mentioned, is not a part of Istanbul's provincial limits, and thus not subject to the jurisdiction of its metropolitan municipality. The word metropolitan (municipality) is generally only used as an administrative distinction in Turkey.\nUrban population rate: 73% (2024).

The FUA represents an attempt at a harmonised definition of the metropolitan area, and the goal was to have an area from which a significant share of the residents commute into the city. The FUA consists of a city and its commuting zone, which is a contiguous area of spatial units that have at least 15% of their employed residents working in the city.\nA further, derived concept is the typology of metropolitan regions. A NUTS 3 region (or a group thereof) is considered to be metropolitan, if at least 50% of its residents live inside a FUA with a population of 250,000 or more. NUTS 3 regions not meeting these criteria are considered to be non-metropolitan regions.\nAlbania.\nUrban population rate: 61% (2024).

The official translation of this statistical area in English (as used by INSEE) is \"functional area\". The AAV follows the same definition as the Functional Urban Area (FUA) used by Eurostat and the OECD, and the AAVs are thus strictly comparable to the FUAs.\nThe AAV replaced in 2020 the metropolitan statistical area called \"aire urbaine\" (AU). The AU, which was defined differently than the AAV, has now been discarded by INSEE and replaced with the AAV in order to facilitate international comparisons.\nUrban population rate: 88% (2024).

They comprise the major German cities and their surrounding catchment areas and form the political, commercial and cultural centers of the country. For urban centers outside metropolitan areas, that generate a similar attraction at smaller scale for their region, the concept of the Regiopolis and respectively regiopolitan area or region was introduced by German professors in 2006.\nUrban population rate: 79% (2024).

The European Union's ESPON group has compiled a separate list of metropolitan areas which covers the UK. Industrial and housing growth in the United Kingdom during the 19th and early 20th centuries produced many conurbations. Greater London is by far the largest urban area and is usually counted as a conurbation in statistical terms, but differs from the others in the degree to which it is focused on a single central area. In the mid-1950s the Green Belt was introduced to stem the further urbanisation of the countryside in South East England. The list below shows the most populous urban areas in the UK as defined by the Office for National Statistics (ONS). Different organisations define conurbations in the UK differently for example, the Liverpool\u2013Manchester or the Manchester\u2013Liverpool conurbation is defined as one conurbation by AESOP in a comparison report published by the University of Manchester in 2005 found here. The Liverpool\u2013Manchester Conurbation has a population of 5.68 million. \nUrban population rate: 89% (2024). Metropolitan area population data are referred to 2024.\nNorth America.\nCanada.\nIn Canada, a \"census metropolitan area\" (CMA) or \"census agglomeration\" (CA) consists of one or more neighboring municipalities centered around a core population. A CMA requires a total population of at least 100,000, with 50,000 or more residing in the core, while a CA requires a core population of at least 10,000. Both are determined using data from Canada's Census of Population Program, and surrounding municipalities must demonstrate strong economic integration with the core, measured by commuting patterns.\nUrban population rate: 85% (2024). Metropolitan area population data are referred to 2024.\nUnited States.\nAs of February 28, 2013, the United States Office of Management and Budget (OMB) defined 1,098 statistical areas for the metropolitan areas of the United States and Puerto Rico. These 1,098 statistical areas comprise 929 Core-Based Statistical Areas (CBSAs) and 169 Combined Statistical Areas (CSAs). The 929 Core-Based Statistical Areas are divided into 388 Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs \u2013 381 for the U.S. and seven for Puerto Rico) and 541 Micropolitan Statistical Areas (\u03bcSAs \u2013 536 for the U.S. and five for Puerto Rico). The 169 Combined Statistical Areas (166 for the U.S. and three for Puerto Rico) each comprise two or more adjacent Core Based Statistical Areas.\nThe OMB defines a Metropolitan Statistical Area as one or more adjacent counties or county equivalents that have at least one urban area of at least 50,000 population, plus adjacent territory that has a high degree of economic and social integration with the core as measured by commuting ties. The OMB then defines a Combined Statistical Area as consisting of various combinations of adjacent metropolitan and micropolitan statistical areas with economic ties measured by commuting patterns. The Office of Management and Budget further defines a core-based statistical area (CBSA) to be a geographical area that consists of one or more counties (or equivalents) anchored by an urban center of at least 10,000 people plus adjacent counties that are socioeconomically tied to the urban center by commuting.\nUrban population rate: 86% (2024).\nMexico.\nMetropolitan areas are known as \"zonas metropolitanas\" in Mexico. The National Population Council (CONAPO) defines them as:\nUrban population rate: 82% (2024). Metropolitan area population data are referred to 2024.\nOceania.\nAustralia.\nThe Australian Bureau of Statistics uses \"Greater Capital City Statistical Areas\" (GCCSAs), which are geographical areas designed to represent the functional extent of each of the eight state and territory capital cities. They were designed to reflect labor markets, using the 2011 Census \"travel to work\" data. Labor markets are sometimes used as proxy measures of the functional extent of a city as it contains the majority of the commuting population. GCCSAs replaced \"Statistical Divisions\" used until 2011.\nOther metropolitan areas in Australia include cross border cities or continuous built-up areas between two or more cities that are connected by an extensive public transport network that allows for commuting for work or services.\nUrban population rate: 91% (2024).

Conurbaciones tend to have a bit over 200.000 inhabitants to be considered as such. An example is the Conurbacion de Rancagua, which considers the area shared by the city of Rancagua, and the adjacent smaller towns of Machal\u00ed, Gultro and Graneros. \nUrban population rate: 92% (2024).

Written by Sam Rolfe and Harold Jack Bloom, the film is about a bounty hunter who tries to bring a murderer to justice, and is forced to accept the help of two strangers who are less than trustworthy.\nThe original music score was composed by Bronis\u0142aw Kaper and the cinematography was by William C. Mellor. \"The Naked Spur\" was filmed on location in Durango and the San Juan Mountains in Colorado and in Lone Pine, California.\nThe film was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay\u2014a rare honor for a Western. This was the third Western film collaboration between Anthony Mann and James Stewart. In 1997, \"The Naked Spur\" was added to the United States National Film Registry, being deemed \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\". In 2021, \"The Naked Spur\" was released on Blu-ray in the North American region by Warner Bros. in their Archive Collection. The disc is supplemented by an audio commentary by Peter Bogdanovich, intercut with selections from an audio interview with Mann.\nPlot.\nIn 1868, in the Rocky Mountains in Colorado, Howard Kemp offers grizzled prospector Jesse Tate $20 for help tracking Ben Vandergroat, wanted for killing a marshal in Abilene, Kansas. Kemp shows him a torn \"WANTED\" poster. Tate assumes that Kemp is a sheriff.\nAn avalanche of rocks blocks their path. Kemp fires, provoking another rock slide. Roy Anderson, recently discharged from the 6th Cavalry, is attracted by the shots. Kemp asks to see his discharge: Anderson is \"morally unstable\".\nAnderson scales a cliff face and catches Vandergroat. The outlaw's companion, Lina Patch, jumps in. Kemp and Tate stop the fight. Lina's father, killed robbing a bank in Abilene, was Vandergroat's friend.\nVandergroat reveals that Kemp is no lawman and that the bottom of the \"WANTED\" poster offers $5,000 to whoever brings him in \"DEAD OR ALIVE.\" Tate and Anderson want their shares. Lina believes that Vandergroat is innocent. On the trail, Vandergroat wages a constant psychological campaign to turn his captors against each other by various means, starting with the observation that the reward will be larger divided by two.\nScouting a mountain pass, Kemp and Tate spot a dozen Blackfoot far from their normal territory. Anderson confesses that they are after him for raping the chief's daughter. Kemp tells Anderson to ride away, fast, so the rest of them will be safe. The Blackfoot catch up to Kemp's group, and when they all stop, Anderson shoots the chief from a hidden position.\nDuring the ensuing battle, Kemp saves Vandergroat but is shot in the leg. Lina helps him to recover. They all ride on. When Kemp passes out, they make camp. Delirious, he thinks that he is leaving to fight in the Civil War and Lina is Mary, his fianc\u00e9e. Strains of \"Beautiful Dreamer\" play.\nVandergroat explains that Kemp had signed his ranch over to Mary so that she could legally work it while he was fighting in the war. But when Kemp returned after the war, he found that Mary had sold his ranch out from under him and ran away with another man. Vandergroat adds that Kemp's one-third share of the reward money is not enough to buy back his ranch, and that they should worry. Lina tells Kemp that she is not \u201cwith\u201d Vandergroat romantically. She has only seen him fighting fair and believes his promise of a ranch in California. Later, Vandergroat loosens Kemp's saddle cinch and pushes him over the edge of a steep mountain trail. A tree breaks his fall, and he crawls back up. That night, Vandergroat grins to see Kemp gently pull Lina's blanket over her.\nThey take refuge from a storm in a cave. Vandergroat tells Lina to distract Kemp so that he can escape through the back of the cave. The alternative: He will kill Kemp. The \"Beautiful Dreamer\" theme plays as Lina describes her dream of California, and Kemp reminisces about his ranch. They kiss. Vandergroat takes his chance. Kemp hauls him back. Anderson wants to kill Vandergroat since the reward is \"Dead or Alive.\" Tate stops Anderson but, infuriated, Kemp challenges Vandergroat to a quick draw, which he refuses.\nAt the river, now running so high they must detour downstream, Anderson lassoes Vandergroat's neck, intending to drag the \u201csack of money\u201d across. Kemp and Anderson fight. While Kemp and Anderson recover and Lina searches for firewood, Vandergroat offers Tate an irresistible temptation: a gold mine.\nTate helps Vandergroat and Lina escape. Vandergroat and Lina ride double; Tate follows, holding a rifle. Vandergroat yells \"Snake!\" and in the confusion, grabs the rifle. Vandergroat then shoots and kills Tate in cold blood, leaving his body where it will be seen by the others. Lina finally accepts the truth about him, and realizes that it was Vandergroat who had killed the marshal in Abilene.\nVandergroat fires on Kemp and Anderson from the cliff above, but Lina grabs the rifle barrel. While Anderson exchanges gunfire with Vandergroat, Kemp uses one of his spurs as a piton to climb the cliff and outflank Vandergroat.\nSuspicious, Vandergroat rises to fire at Kemp. Kemp throws the spur into his cheek, and Anderson shoots Vandergroat. The body falls into the river and is entangled in the roots of dead trees lodged on the opposite bank. Anderson lassos a snag and crosses. He wraps the rope around Vandergroat's body but is killed by a giant floating log that drowns Anderson and takes his body down the river.\nKemp drags Vandergroat's body across the river and hoists it onto his horse, in a rage, vowing that he will take him back. Lina says she will go with him, no matter his choice, marry him, and live with him. Weeping, he declares one last time that he is taking him back. The \"Beautiful Dreamer\" theme soars. Calming, Kemp asks her if she still wants to try California. He begins to dig the grave, and she makes coffee.\nStunt performers.\nVirginia Bougas, Ted Mapes, Frank McGrath, Chuck Roberson, Jack Williams, Jack N. Young.\nProduction.\n\"The Naked Spur\" was the third of five Western collaborations between James Stewart and Anthony Mann and the third of eight overall collaborations. The two previous Westerns were \"Winchester '73\" (1950) and \"Bend of the River\" (1952). Stewart was given the lead role of Howard Kemp, an embittered rancher turned bounty hunter. The film is notable for having only five speaking parts. There were a number of parts of a band of Native Americans that were ambushed by Anderson.\nRobert Ryan, known for his roles as ruthless villains and hard-boiled cops, was cast as Ben Vandergroat, a wild killer with a $5,000 \"dead or alive\" bounty on his head for the murder of a Kansas marshal. Ryan would work with Mann again in \"Men in War\" (1957) and \"God's Little Acre\" (1958). Janet Leigh was cast as Lina Patch, Vandergroat's companion who eventually falls in love with Kemp. Leigh starred alongside Ryan in the film noir \"Act of Violence\" (1948), which was directed by Fred Zinnemann. Ralph Meeker was cast as Roy Anderson, a disgraced Army officer.\nMillard Mitchell, who played Jesse Tate, a grizzled old prospector, died at fifty years of age from lung cancer shortly after this picture. This was his next-to-last movie, followed by \"Here Come the Girls\" (released October 1953), starring Bob Hope.\nThe film was filmed in Lone Pine, California, and on location in the San Juan Mountains and Durango in Colorado. In an interview conducted in 1967, Mann described it as \"magnificent countryside and everything lent itself to improvisation. I never understood why almost all westerns are shot in desert landscapes! John Ford, for example, adores Monument Valley, but I know Monument Valley very well and it\u2019s not the whole West. In fact, the desert represents only one part of the American West. I wanted to show the mountains, the waterfalls, the forested areas, the snowy summits \u2013 in short to rediscover the whole Daniel Boone atmosphere: the characters emerge more fully from such an environment. In that sense the shooting of \"The Naked Spur\" gave me some genuine satisfaction.\"\nAccording to writer and historian Frederic B. Wildfang, during filming Stewart dedicated a monument in town, marking the area as the \"Hollywood of the Rockies\". Production started in late May and ended in June 1952.\nReception.\nThe film premiered in the first day of February 1953. That same year, two other films directed by Mann and starring Stewart were also released. These were \"Thunder Bay\" and \"The Glenn Miller Story\".\nJonathan Rosenbaum would later hail \"The Naked Spur\" as a masterpiece as well as \"Mann\u2019s best and most elemental western,\" writing that it had \"some of the most intense psychological warfare to be found in Mann\u2019s angular and anguished oeuvre.\" \"Empire\" also hailed the movie as \"a masterpiece that\u2019s too easy to take for granted\" and \"the best of an outstanding run of Westerns.\"\nThe movie holds a perfect 100% rating on Rotten Tomatoes.\nAccording to MGM records the film earned $2,423,000 in the US and Canada and $1,427,000 overseas, resulting in a profit to the studio of $1,081,000.\nThis success ensured three more Stewart-Mann collaborations, including two more Westerns. Screenwriters Sam Rolfe and Harold Jack Bloom were nominated for the 1953 Best Screenplay Academy Award. In the years since its release, the film has achieved continued success, gaining more critical acclaim now than upon first release. Leonard Maltin has lauded \"The Naked Spur\" as \"one of the best westerns ever made\".\nAlthough much is made of the collaboration between James Stewart and Anthony Mann, Robert Ryan also teamed with Mann in \"The Naked Spur\", \"Men in War\", and \"God's Little Acre\".\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The film follows various people involved in the country and gospel music industry in Nashville, Tennessee, over the five-day period leading up to a gala concert for a populist outsider running for president on the Replacement Party ticket.\n\"Nashville\" is often noted for its scope; the film contains 24 main characters, an hour's worth of musical numbers, and multiple storylines. Its large ensemble cast includes David Arkin, Barbara Baxley, Ned Beatty, Karen Black, Ronee Blakley, Timothy Brown, Keith Carradine, Geraldine Chaplin, Robert DoQui, Shelley Duvall, Allen Garfield, Henry Gibson, Scott Glenn, Jeff Goldblum, Barbara Harris, David Hayward, Michael Murphy, Allan F. Nicholls, Dave Peel, Cristina Raines, Bert Remsen, Lily Tomlin, Gwen Welles, and Keenan Wynn.\nThe screenplay for \"Nashville\" was written by Altman's frequent collaborator Joan Tewkesbury, based partly on her experiences as an outsider visiting the city and observing its local music industry. Several incidents she experienced appear in the finished film, though Altman improvised numerous additional scenes and plot strands during filming. The film was shot on location in Nashville in 1974.\n\"Nashville\" was released by Paramount Pictures in the summer of 1975, and opened with widespread critical acclaim, praising the ensemble cast (mainly Blakley and Tomlin), mise-en-sc\u00e8ne and soundtrack. It garnered numerous accolades, including five Academy Award nominations, including Best Picture, Best Director, Best Supporting Actress (for both Ronee Blakley and Lily Tomlin), and winning for Best Original Song for Carradine's track \"I'm Easy\". The film was nominated for a total of 11 Golden Globe Awards, to date the highest number of nominations received by one film. Since then, it has been considered Altman's \"magnum opus\", and one of the greatest films of all time. In 1992, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".\nPlot.\nHal Phillip Walker, Replacement Party candidate in the 1976 United States presidential election, arrives in Nashville for a fundraising gala. Meanwhile, two recording sessions are taking place in a nearby studio: in one room, country superstar Haven Hamilton records a patriotic song commemorating the Bicentennial, while next door, Linnea Reese, a white gospel singer, records a song with the Jubilee Singers of historically black Fisk University. Opal, an Englishwoman who claims to be working on a documentary for the BBC (though she refers to the British Broadcasting Company, not the British Broadcasting Corporation), attempts to listen in on the sessions.\nLater that day, country singer Barbara Jean returns to Nashville following what the crowd believes was a burn accident (which may actually have been a nervous breakdown and stay at a mental hospital). She is greeted at Berry Field by local industry elites, including Haven and his companion, Lady Pearl, a nightclub owner. Also present are Pfc. Glenn Kelly, who is obsessed with Barbara Jean, and a popular folk trio consisting of married couple Bill and Mary, and guitarist Tom, who are in town to record an album. Meanwhile, Martha, a teen groupie going by the name \"L.A. Joan\", is picked up by her uncle, Mr. Green, at the airport; she has arrived to visit her dying aunt Esther, but covertly plans to pursue musicians. In the airport cafe, African-American cook Wade Cooley and his co-worker, a waitress named Sueleen, discuss her aspirations to become a singer.\nOn the tarmac, Barbara Jean collapses from heat exhaustion, and those in attendance depart the airport only to become stranded after a vehicle pile-up occurs. During the commotion, Winifred, an aspiring country singer, runs away from her husband Star; Star then gives a ride to Kenny Frasier, who has just arrived in town carrying a violin case. Opal takes advantage of the traffic jam to interview Linnea, as well as Tommy Brown, an African-American country singer. That night, Sueleen performs at an open mic, demonstrating no singing ability, but leading to her recruitment as entertainment for Walker's fundraiser. Meanwhile, Linnea's husband Del has John Triplette, Walker's political organizer, over for dinner. Throughout the meal, Linnea mainly focuses on communicating with her two deaf children. Tom, who crossed paths with Linnea a few weeks earlier, phones the house to ask Linnea on a date, but she dissuades him. At a party he hosts, Haven is offered a political career by Triplette despite being informed that Haven will never take political sides. Glamorous singer Connie White performs that night, in lieu of Barbara Jean at the Grand Ole Opry. Mary misses Connie's performance to Bill's dismay, instead having sex with Tom at the hotel. At the hospital, Barbara Jean argues with her manager husband Barnett over Connie replacing her, and he accuses her of having another nervous breakdown, angrily establishing his dominance.\nOn Sunday morning, Lady Pearl, Wade, and Sueleen attend a Catholic mass, while Linnea sings in the choir of a black Baptist church. In the hospital chapel, Barbara Jean sings \"In the Garden\" from her wheelchair while Mr. Green, Pfc. Kelly, and others watch. Opal wanders through a massive auto scrapyard, recording observations on a tape recorder. Haven, Tommy, and their families attend the stock car races, where Winifred unsuccessfully attempts to sing on a small stage. Bill and Mary argue in their hotel room and are interrupted by Triplette, who recruits them to perform at the gala, while Tom tries to get chauffeur Norman to score him drugs.\nAfter Barbara Jean is discharged, she gives an initially strong performance at Opryland USA that ends in her being pulled off stage as she rambles between songs. To remediate her poor performance, Barnett pledges her to perform at Walker's gala. Martha meanwhile agitates Kenny, who is renting a room in her uncle's house, when she attempts to open his violin case. At the Exit/In club that night, Linnea, Martha, Bill, Mary, Opal, Norman and Wade are among those attending an open mic. Tom sings \"I'm Easy\" and Linnea, moved, goes back to his room, where they have sex. Tom is accustomed to women becoming clingy and emotional after trysts but Linnea is polite but detached afterwards. She leaves Tom's room oblivious to his blatant attempts to rattle her and make her jealous, frustrating him. Meanwhile, at an all-male Walker fundraiser, Sueleen is booed off stage for singing poorly; Del and Triplette convince her to perform a striptease in exchange for a slot at the gala. A drunken Del later comes onto Sueleen, but Wade rescues her. He tells her that she cannot sing and attempts to persuade her to come to Detroit with him; she refuses, determined to \"sing with Barbara Jean\".\nThe next morning, the performers and audience converge at the Parthenon for Walker's gala concert. Barnett, protecting Barbara Jean, objects to a large political banner hanging as the stage backdrop (under an enormous American flag). When the concert opens, the banner has not been removed. The lineup consists of Barbara Jean, Haven, Linnea and her choir, Mary and Tom, and Sueleen; Winifred arrives, hoping to sing. Meanwhile, Mr. Green and Kenny arrive at the gala searching for Martha, who has failed to attend her aunt Esther's funeral, and find her accompanying Bill. During Barbara Jean's set on stage, Kenny produces a gun from his violin case, and begins shooting at the stage. Barbara Jean is shot; a bullet grazes Haven's arm. Chaos breaks out. Kelly disarms Kenny. Barbara Jean is carried off the stage, bleeding profusely. Haven tries to calm the crowd by exhorting them to sing, asserting that \"This isn't Dallas.\u201d Being wounded, he gives over the mike to Winifred, who haltingly then more strongly begins singing \"It Don't Worry Me\", eventually joined by Linnea's gospel choir also on stage.\nCast.\nMajor characters\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;* David Arkin as Norman, a chauffeur hired to drive Bill, Mary and Tom during their stay in Nashville. While he believes himself to be their friend and confidant, they simply consider him the hired help, though he becomes a confidant to Bill. \nMinor characters\nThere are cameo appearances by Elliott Gould, Julie Christie, Sue Barton, Vassar Clements, and Howard K. Smith, all playing themselves. Gould and Christie were passing through Nashville when Altman added them. Altman plays Bob, an unseen producer who in the beginning of the film is producing Haven Hamilton's song \"200 Years\". He can be heard on a speaker when Hamilton gets agitated by Frog's inept piano playing.\nAnalysis and themes.\nIn a 1995 academic article published in \"American Quarterly\", Paul Lauter, a professor of American Studies at Trinity College, compared the film to \"a poststructuralist theoretical text\", adding that \"it invites, indeed valorizes, contradiction and seems designed to resist closure.\" As a result, he explained, \"interpretations of the film have been wildly divergent and evaluations contradictory.\"\nPolitical content.\nFilm scholars Yoram Allon, Del Cullen, and Hannah Patterson describe \"Nashville\" as an \"epic study of ambition, greed, talent, and politics in American culture, with the country and western music businesses serving as a microcosm of American society.\" Ray Sawhill of \"Salon\" views the film as reflective of the 1970s' political climate, writing that the film \"comes across as a piece of New Journalism; it's like Norman Mailer's reports from conventions and rallies. Altman is using Nashville metaphorically\u2014he's really talking about politics. I wish he didn't make that quite so explicit. There's a reference to Dallas and a few to the Kennedys, as well as some red-white-and-blue visual cues, that the film could have done without. Still, the result is an X-ray of the era's uneasy political soul. What it reveals is a country trying to pull itself together from a nervous breakdown.\"\nCelebrity.\nSawhill suggests that the film is preoccupied with \"a populist culture driving itself mad with celebrity\" and presents Nashville as a \"provincial New York or Hollywood, as one of the places where the culture manufactures its image of itself.\" He cites the various recording and communication devices present as evidence of this: \"wires, phones, intercoms, cameras, mikes, speakers\u2014seem to be everywhere; so does the machinery of publicity and fame. We watch the city recording itself, playing itself back to itself and marketing that image to itself. We eavesdrop on the culture's conversation with itself. We're watching people decide how they want to see themselves and how they want to sell themselves.\"\nProduction.\nScreenplay.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n \"[Connie White and Barbara Jean] are the personification of Nashville rivalries...\u00a0 the prototype of what Nashville music wanted its women to look like. Tammy Wynette. Dolly [Parton]. These women are tough, but my God they believe in religion. Dolly is up at four in the morning writing her songs and saying her prayers and she is not bullshitting you about that. There is great heart to these women.\"\n\u2014Screenwriter Tewkesbury on the basis of Connie White and Barbara Jean\nIn the 1970s, United Artists attempted to hire Robert Altman to direct a screenplay about country-western music titled \"The Great Southern Amusement Company\". Altman declined but became interested in directing a film on the subject after reading William Price Fox's novel \"Ruby Red\", and agreed to make an original film for UA. The original screenplay for \"Nashville\" was written by Joan Tewkesbury, who had collaborated with Altman on several of his films, including \"McCabe &amp; Mrs. Miller\" (1971) and \"Thieves Like Us\" (1974). She had proposed a Nashville-set film to Altman prior to his filming of \"McCabe &amp; Mrs. Miller\"; he became interested in the setting and sent Tewkesbury to Nashville in the fall of 1973 to observe the area and its citizenry. Tewkesbury's diary of her trip provided the basis for the screenplay, with many observations making it into the finished film, such as the highway pileup. However, as with most Altman projects, much of the dialogue was improvised with the script acting as a \"blueprint\" dictating the actions of the characters and the plot.\nTewkesbury, who was working as an instructor at the University of Southern California, rewrote her screenplay several times. In the original draft, the film opened with a scene featuring Tom on the street in New York City prior to his arrival in Nashville. Tewkesbury had been partly inspired to write the film based on her observations of the music industry being geographically \"pulled apart. The country-western thing had suddenly exploded in Nashville, but [musicians] still had to come to New York for getting paid, and business deals.\" None of Tewkesbury's incarnations of the screenplay featured any death scenes, but Altman, who had a \"penchant for the tragic denouement\", proposed the idea that Barbara Jean would be assassinated in the finale. Altman also conceived the political subplot about the presidential candidate Hal Phillip Walker. The political speeches and dialogue for this subplot were written by Altman's colleague Thomas Hal Phillips, whose brother Rubel Phillips had run as the Republican Party candidate in the 1963 and 1967 Mississippi gubernatorial elections.\nNumerous characters in \"Nashville\" are based on real country music figures: Henry Gibson's Haven Hamilton is a composite of Roy Acuff, Hank Snow, and Porter Wagoner; Ronee Blakley's Barbara Jean is based on Loretta Lynn; the black country singer Tommy Brown (played by Timothy Brown) is based on Charley Pride; and the feuding folk trio is based on Peter, Paul and Mary; within the trio, the married couple of Bill and Mary were inspired by Bill Danoff and Taffy Nivert, who later became Starland Vocal Band. Keith Carradine's character is believed to be inspired by Kris Kristofferson, and Karen Black's Connie White was conceived as a composite of Lynn Anderson (who spoke unfavorably of the film after its release), Tammy Wynette, and Dolly Parton. Other characters were based on or inspired by real persons: Linnea was inspired by Louise Fletcher, who had appeared in Altman's \"Thieves Like Us\" (1973), and who had two deaf parents. The black choir singing with Linnea early in the film is based on the Fisk Jubilee Singers, though it's disputed whether the performers in the film were actually Fisk University students or members of the B. C. &amp; M. (Baptist, Catholic, and Methodist) Choir, a black interdenominational gospel choir based in Nashville. Altman also hired television reporter Howard K. Smith to deliver a commentary on Hal Phillip Walker, for which he instructed him to say anything he wanted either for or against his fictional candidacy.\nAlthough UA had originally agreed to produce the script, the studio reneged because it was unsatisfied with the financial performance of Altman's previous films \"The Long Goodbye\" (1973) and \"Thieves Like Us\" (1974). After unsuccessfully pitching the film to other studios, producer Jerry Weintraub secured a $2.7 million budget from ABC Records, which wanted to promote a record company it had interest in.\nCasting.\nAs with most of Altman's feature films, he cast the roles using unorthodox methods, forgoing standard auditions and instead basing his decisions off meetings with individual actors. Geraldine Chaplin, daughter of Charlie Chaplin and Oona O'Neill, was the first to be cast, appearing in the role of Opal, the chatty journalist who has arrived from out of town to cover the gala. Screenwriter Tewkesbury, who had based the character of Opal on herself, selected Chaplin for the role long before the production had even secured funding. Altman flew Chaplin from her residence in Switzerland to Nashville, and she toured the city with Tewkesbury in preparation for the role.\nSeveral Altman regulars were cast in the film, among them Keith Carradine as Tom, the dashing folk singer who woos several of the female characters, and Shelley Duvall as Martha, the young groupie. Both Carradine and Duvall had had minor roles in \"McCabe &amp; Mrs. Miller\", and had co-starred in \"Thieves Like Us\". Through Carradine, Altman met Allan Nicholls, Carradine's co-star from a Broadway production of \"Hair\". After a meeting, Altman offered Nicholls the role of Bill. Cristina Raines, Carradine's real-life girlfriend at the time, was given the role of Mary, the female counterpart in Bill and Tom's folk trio. Gwen Welles, who had a major part in Altman's previous film, \"California Split\", was cast as Sueleen, a waitress who longs to be a singer.\nKaren Black was cast in the role of glamorous singer Connie White after having approached Altman to appear in a prior film, the psychological thriller \"Images\" (1972). Black, who had been writing and singing songs in the interim, was cast in \"Nashville\" after performing several original songs for Altman. The role of Barbara Jean had not been filled when filming was about to commence. Ronee Blakley, a singer-songwriter from Idaho with no acting experience, was in Nashville at the time and took on the role at the last minute, having been hired to write several songs for the film. Barbara Harris, primarily a stage actress, was given the role of fledgling singer Winifred.\nIn the role of Linnea Reese, the gospel singer and dedicated mother, Altman cast Lily Tomlin, who at the time had no prior film experience, having worked exclusively in television. Altman had originally cast Louise Fletcher in the role, but Tomlin was hired after Fletcher replaced her as Nurse Ratched in \"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\" (1975). \"When I got the script, I didn't even know what part I was being considered for,\" Tomlin recalled. \"But I thought, I could play any one of these parts. Even the boys.\" Ned Beatty was cast as Del, Linnea's lawyer husband. Robert Duvall was initially sought for the role of Haven Hamilton, the country superstar, but he declined the role based on Altman's low salary offer. Instead, Altman cast Henry Gibson in the part. Altman struggled finding an actor to portray Bud Hamilton, the Harvard-graduate son of country superstar Haven. While preparing for his role as Haven, Gibson began taking guitar lessons in Santa Monica, and met David Peel, a guitar instructor, who bore a significant resemblance to him. After meeting with Peel, Altman cast him as Bud.\nFilming.\nThe film was shot on location in Nashville in the summer of 1974 on a budget of $2.2 million. In late June, the cast began arriving in Nashville; Carradine and Raines traveled together from Los Angeles, while Beatty arrived and hitched a camper where he resided along with his wife through the duration of the shoot. Beatty recalled an early meeting in which Altman had the cast convene prior to filming: \"Bob gets us together in this room. We're all ready to start the movie. And he said, 'Look, I want you to have fun with this. There is only one thing we have to remember. Every character in this movie loves one character. Every one of these characters loves Barbara Jean.' Well, within a short time Ronee Blakley was the only actor in the film who was universally disliked.\" Throughout the shoot, Altman and Blakley had several disputes regarding her character, and Blakley sometimes rewrote her scenes to Altman's dismay.\nLocations featured in the film include the Nashville International Airport, and the Exit/In, a Nashville club which screenwriter Tewkesbury had frequented during her trips there. The scene in which Carradine's character performs \"I'm Easy\" was shot at this club. Altman's log cabin-style house on the outskirts of Nashville was used as the home of Haven and Lady Pearl. The film's climactic assassination sequence, which takes places at the Parthenon, was originally intended to take place at the Ryman Auditorium. However, Altman was forced to change the locale when he was unable to secure access to the then-recently shuttered Ryman Auditorium. Walker, the climactic assassination, the political theme and various associated characters (such as Haven Hamilton) do not appear in the earliest versions of the script, and were integrated into the screenplay throughout filming.\nAll of the musical scenes featured in the film are actual live concert footage.\nThe hospital scenes centered on Barbara Jean were filmed in a local hospital that had been closed; one floor of it was refurbished for use in filming.\nNearly all of the extras in the film were Nashville locals. Many of them were not actively participating in the film but simply happened to be at the location where the cast and crew were filming at the time. Recording session legend Lloyd Green (\"Mr. Nashville Sound\") can be seen playing pedal steel guitar in the opening studio scene. Jeff Newman, known for the pedal steel, is sitting next to him playing a banjo.\nPost-production.\n\"Nashville\"'s opening title sequence was designed by the film title designer Dan Perri, who had recently enjoyed his big break with his work on \"The Exorcist\" (1973). Under Altman's direction, Perri based the film's unusual, kitschy title sequence on low-budget K-Tel Records television commercials, and brought in Johnny Grant to provide the loud, brash voiceover. Perri later went on to design titles for a number of other major Hollywood pictures, including \"Taxi Driver\" (1976), \"Star Wars\" (1977), and \"Raging Bull\" (1980).\nAltman had enough footage to produce a four-hour film, and assistant director Alan Rudolph suggested he create an expanded version of \"Nashville\" to be shown in two parts, \"Nashville Red\" and \"Nashville Blue\", but the film ultimately remained intact. After a rush of critical acclaim, ABC expressed interest in a proposal for a 10-hour miniseries of \"Nashville\", based on the footage not used in the final cut, but plans for the project were scrapped. The additional footage has not been made available on DVD releases.\nHowever, in a 2000 interview with \"The A.V. Club\", Altman disputed the claim that he had several hours worth of deleted scenes to cut another feature-length film (or two) out of. Altman claimed that there \"were no deleted scenes\" and that \"almost everything we shot is in that film\". Altman further stated the unseen, extra footage that wasn't used in the final cut of the film was mainly music and not much else.\nMusic.\nMany of the actors and actresses in the film composed the songs they performed in the film. Blakley wrote several tracks, including \"Bluebird\", performed by Timothy Brown, and \"Tapedeck in His Tractor\" and \"My Idaho Home\", performed by Blakley. Karen Black wrote \"Memphis\" and \"Rolling Stone\", the two songs she performed in the character of Connie White. Carradine wrote and performed \"I'm Easy\", which won an Academy Award for Best Original Song and a Golden Globe for Best Original Song - Motion Picture. Additionally, Carradine wrote \"It Don't Worry Me\", which is heard on the soundtrack throughout the film, and is the closing number performed by Barbara Harris onstage at the Parthenon.\nComposer Richard Baskin composed songs for Henry Gibson to sing in character as Haven Hamilton. Several Nashville session musicians took part in the music recording and in the film, including violinist Vassar Clements and guitarist Harold Bradley. \"Keep a Goin\" was based on a poem Gibson recited on \"The Dick Van Dyke Show\" \"Talk to the Snail\" (Season 5, Episode 24).\nWhile the music featured in the film was viewed in the Nashville music industry as mean-spirited satire, the songs have achieved a cult-status among alternative country musicians. In 2002, the album, \"A Tribute to Robert Altman's Nashville\" was released, featuring interpretations of the film's songs by Canadian alt-country figures, including Carolyn Mark, Kelly Hogan and Neko Case.\nABC Records issued a motion picture soundtrack to the film in 1975, featuring the various original musical numbers. It was reissued by MCA Nashville in 2015.\nNon-album tracks\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nRelease.\nBox office.\nThe film was a box-office success, with theatrical rentals of $6.8 million in North America by 1976. According to a piece in \"Film Comment,\" \"it is still amazing to me that the impression was so prevalent in the cultural reaches of Manhattan that \"Nashville\" was one of the year's commercial blockbusters rather than, as it was, the twenty-seventh highest-grossing film of the year.\" The film grossed approximately $10 million in the United States.\nCritical response.\n\"Nashville\" received significant attention from critics, with Patrick McGilligan of \"The Boston Globe\" writing that it was \"perhaps the most talked about American movie since Orson Welles' \"Citizen Kane\". Pauline Kael, film critic for The New Yorker, described it as \"the funniest epic vision of America ever to reach the screen\". Gene Siskel, Roger Ebert, and Leonard Maltin gave the film four-star reviews and called it the best film of 1975. In his original review, Ebert wrote \"after I saw it I felt more alive, I felt I understood more about people, I felt somehow wiser. It's that good a movie.\" On August 6, 2000, Ebert included it in his \"The Great Movies\" compilation.\nVincent Canby of \"The New York Times\" praised the film's music as \"funny, moving and almost nonstop\" as well as its \"well\u2010defined structure, [in which] individual sequences often burst with the kind of life that seems impossible to plan.\" Writing for the \"New York Daily News\", Harry Haun praised the film's attention to detail and characterization, noting: \"I have seen \"Nashville\" 4\u00bd times, and I'm still discovering dimensions that had eluded me.\" Charles Champlin of the \"Los Angeles Times\" praised the humor, which he noted as ranging \"from slapstick to satire\", and commended the film as \"the most original and provocative American movie in a very long time.\"\nAccording to film critic Ruth McCormick, however, after an initial wave of praise, a critical backlash ensued. \"Robert Mazzocco in \"The New York Review of Books\", Greil Marcus in \"The Village Voice\" and John Malone in \"The New York Times\" wrote articles that ranged from debunking the hype and calling \"Nashville\" superficial and overrated, to absolutely hating the film for its aesthetic shortcomings or its purported pessimism, cynicism and sexism.\"\nWriting for \"The New Yorker,\" Pauline Kael called the film \"a radical, evolutionary leap\" and asked if there was \"such a thing as an orgy for movie lovers.\" Kael goes on to praise \"Nashville\" as \"the funniest epic vision of America ever to reach the screen.\"\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, of 132 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 9/10. The website's consensus reads: \"Robert Altman captures the bravado and cynicism of the American dream in \"Nashville\", a sprawling epic bursting with vivid performances and an unforgettable soundtrack.\" Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the a score of 96 out of 100, based on 24 critics, indicating .\nControversy.\nThe film was widely despised by the mainstream country-music community at the time of its release; many artists believed it ridiculed their talent and sincerity. Altman felt they were mad because he chose not to use their music in favor of letting the actors compose their own material. However, he stated the movie has since become popular in the city among more recent generations.\nThe film garnered further attention in 1980 due to its climactic shooting scene of Barbara Jean, as it predated, but eerily mirrored, what would be the murder of John Lennon. In an interview on 2000 DVD release, Altman remarks that after Lennon's death, reporters questioned the director about \"Nashville\" and its harbinger of the assassination of a music star.\nRobert Altman: \"When John Lennon got assassinated, I got a call immediately from the \"Washington Post\" and they said, 'Do you feel responsible for this?' and I said 'What do you mean, responsible?' 'Well, I mean you're the one that predicted that there would be a political assassination of a star.' And I said 'Well, I don't feel responsible,' but I said, 'but don't you feel responsible for not heeding my warning?' The statement here is, these people are not assassinated because of their ideas or what they do. They're assassinated to draw attention to the assassin. And in political assassinations, in their sort of warped minds, they know that they are going to have a certain amount of people who said 'that son of a bitch [the politician] should have been shot,' because there's such heat about it. But actually what they are doing is killing somebody who's in the public eye and is some sort of an icon because this feeling that by doing that, committing that assassination they draw the attention to themselves, and they make themselves consequently important. Ah, and it's no surprise to me, the Lennon assassination, because this is what all that is, and I don't think we've seen the end of it either.\"\nHome media.\nParamount Home Video released \"Nashville\" on VHS and DVD in 2000. In 2013, The Criterion Collection released a Blu-ray edition of the film featuring a new scan and supplemental features, including an archival commentary with Altman as well as archival interviews, and a new documentary piece.\nAccolades.\n\"Nashville\" received numerous awards and nominations from various critical organizations, including a total of 11 Golden Globe nominations, which, as of 2025, are the most ever received by one film. It received four nominations in a single acting category; this was and remains unprecedented for major film award shows.\nIt won a BAFTA Film Award for Best Sound Track. Altman won for best director from: Cartagena Film Festival; Kansas City Film Critics Circle Awards; National Board of Review; National Society of Film Critics Awards; and the New York Film Critics Circle Awards. Lily Tomlin was awarded the New York Film Critics Circle for Best Supporting Actress. It became the first, and one of the eight (as of 2025) films to win Best Picture from three out of four major U.S. film critics' groups (LA, NBR, NY, NSFC) along with \"All the President's Men\", \"Terms of Endearment\", \"Goodfellas,\" \"Pulp Fiction\", \"The Hurt Locker,\" \"Drive My Car\", and \"T\u00e1r\".\nLegacy.\nPlans were discussed for a sequel set 12 years later and titled \"Nashville 12\", and most of the original players agreed to appear. In the script for the sequel, Lily Tomlin's character, Linnea, is running for political office; and Barnett now managing Connie White and obsessed with a Barbara Jean impersonator.\nContemporarily, \"Nashville\" is regarded in critical circles as Altman's magnum opus, as well as one of the greatest films of all time. In 1992, \"Nashville\" was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\". In 2007, the movie was ranked No.\u00a059 on AFI's 100 Years... 100 Movies - 10th Anniversary Edition list; it did not appear on the original 1998 list. The song \"I'm Easy\" was named the 81st Best Song of All Time by the American Film Institute (AFI). In 2013, \"Entertainment Weekly\" ranked it the ninth-greatest film in history. \"Nashville\" ranked 14th in BBC's 2015 list of the 100 greatest American films. The February 2020 issue of \"New York Magazine\" lists \"Nashville\" as among \"The Best Movies That Lost Best Picture at the Oscars.\"\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

First attested as a Gothic name in the 5th century, it became widespread in the Germanic-speaking world, not least due to its most famous bearer, Theodoric the Great, king of the Ostrogoths.\nOverview.\nThe name was Latinized as \"Theodoricus\" or \"Theodericus\", originally from a Common Germanic form \"*\u00deeudar\u012bks\" (\"people-ruler\") from *\"\u00feeud\u014d\" (\"people\") and *\"r\u012bks\", which would have resulted in a Gothic *\ud800\udf38\ud800\udf39\ud800\udf3f\ud800\udf33\ud800\udf30\ud800\udf42\ud800\udf34\ud800\udf39\ud800\udf3a\ud800\udf43 (*\u00feiudareiks). Anglicized spellings of the name during Late Antiquity and the Early Middle Ages include \"Theodoric\", \"Theoderic\", \"Theudoric\", \"Theuderic\".\nGregory of Tours Latinized the name as \"Theodorus\", in origin the unrelated Greek name Theodore (\u0398\u03b5\u03cc\u03b4\u03c9\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2, meaning \"God's gift\").\nAs the name survived throughout the Middle Ages, it transformed into a multitude of forms in the languages of Western Europe.\nThese include the High German form \"Dietrich\", abbreviated \"Dieter\", the Low German and Dutch form \"Diederik\", or \"Dierik\", abbreviated \"Dirck\", \"Dirk\", \"Dik\" or \"Diede\", the Norwegian \"Tjodrik\", \"Diderik\" and \"Didrik\". Of the Romance languages, French has \"Thierry\" and Italian, Portuguese and Spanish has \"Teodorico\".\nThe English forms \"Derek\", \"Derrick\" and \"Terry\" have been re-introduced from the continent, from Low German, Dutch and French sources. The derived Welsh form is \"Tewdrig\"; however, there also exists the related Welsh name \"Tudur\" (from Proto-Celtic \"*Toutor\u012bxs\", exactly cognate with Proto-Germanic \"*\u00deeudar\u012bks\") which is the origin of the name of the English Tudor dynasty.\nLate antiquity to early Middle Ages.\nThe earliest record of the name is in a Roman-era (3rd century) inscription, discovered in 1784 in Wiesbaden (at the time known as \"Aquae Mattiacorum\" in Germania Superior), edited in \"Codex inscriptionum romanarum Danubii et Rheni\" as no. 684: , interpreted as \"In honorem domus divinae, Apolloni toutiorigi\".\nThis has given rise to a supposed \"Apollo Teutorix\" in 19th-century literature.\nJohn Rh\u0177s (1892) opined that \"the interest attached to the word \"Toutiorix\" is out of all proportion to its single occurrence\".\nThe existence of a genuinely Celtic name \"Teutorix\" or \"Tout(i)orix\" is uncertain, though Welsh \"Tudur\", Old Welsh \"Tutir\" presupposes a precise cognate of \"Toutorix\" at least in ancient British Celtic.\nRh\u0177s surmises that the \"historical Teuton\" (viz. Theoderic the Great) bore a name of the Gaulish Apollo as adopted into early Germanic religion.\nThe first known bearer of the name was Theodoric I, son of Alaric I, king of the Visigoths (d. 451). The Gothic form of the name would have been \"\u00deiudareiks\", which was Latinized as \"Theodericus\". The notability of the name is due to Theoderic the Great, son of Theodemir, king of the Ostrogoths (454\u2013526), who became a legendary figure of the Germanic Heroic Age as Dietrich von Bern.\nAfter the end of late antiquity, during the 6th to 8th centuries there were also several kings of the Franks called Theodoric (or Theuderic).\nFinally, there was an early Anglo-Saxon king of Bernicia called Theodric (also spelled \"Deoric\", Old English \"\").\nHigh and late Middle Ages.\nWhile the Anglo-Saxon name \"Theodric\" (\"Deoric\", old form: th = d) became extinct in the Middle English period, it was adopted in Welsh as \"Tewdrig\".\nThe name remains popular in medieval German as \"Dietrich\", and is adopted into French as \"Thierry\". It is rendered in Medieval Latin as \"Theodoricus\" or as \"Theodericus\".\nThe Middle High German legend of \"Dietrich von Bern\" is based on the historical Theodoric, king of the Ostrogoths. The German \"Dietrich von Bern\" is reflected as \"\u00dei\u00f0rekr af Bern\" in the Old Norse \"\u00dei\u00f0reks saga\". The medieval German legend gives rise to the \"Dietrich\" of the Renaissance era \"Heldenb\u00fccher\".\nThe Old Norse form of the name was \u00dej\u00f3\u00f0r\u00edkr (spelled \u00feiaurik\u0280 on the 9th-century R\u00f6k runestone). This became \"Tjodrik\" in Middle Norwegian.\nThe Dutch form \"Derek\" was used in England from the 15th century. Similarly, the Scandinavian \"Tjodrik\" is attested for the 12th century, but it is replaced by the Low German forms \"Ditrik, Dirk\" in the late medieval period. The spread of the Low German form to Middle Norwegian, Middle Danish and late Middle English or Early Modern English are part of a larger linguistic trend due to the influence of the Hanseatic League during this period.\nModern era.\nThe German form \"Dietrich\" was abbreviated to \"Dieter\". The Low German and Dutch languages abbreviated \"Diederik\" as \"Dirk\" or \"Diede\". \nFrench retains \"Thierry\".\nThe Scandinavian languages have borrowed \"Dirk\" and Diderik, replacing the native \"Tjodrik\", while English borrowed \"Derek\" from Dutch and \"Terry\" from French.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Dmbox/styles.css\" /&gt;\n Name listThis page or section lists people that share the same given name.

It stars John Belushi, Tim Matheson, John Vernon, Verna Bloom, Thomas Hulce, and Donald Sutherland. The film is about a trouble-making fraternity whose members challenge the authority of the dean of the fictional Faber College.\nProduced by Matty Simmons of \"National Lampoon\" and Ivan Reitman for Universal Pictures, it was inspired by stories written by Miller and published in \"National Lampoon\", which were based on Ramis' experience in the Zeta Beta Tau fraternity at Washington University in St. Louis, Miller's Alpha Delta Phi experiences at Dartmouth College in New Hampshire, and producer Reitman's at McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario.\nOf the younger lead actors, only the 28-year-old Belushi was an established star, but even he had not yet appeared in a film, having gained fame as an original cast member of \"Saturday Night Live\", which was in its third season in the autumn of 1977. Several of the actors who were cast as college students, including Thomas Hulce, Karen Allen, and Kevin Bacon, were just beginning their film careers. Matheson, also cast as a student, was already a seasoned actor, having appeared in movies and television since the age of 13.\nFilming took place at the University of Oregon from October to December 1977. Following its initial release on July 28, 1978, \"Animal House\" received generally mixed reviews from critics, but \"Time\" and Roger Ebert proclaimed it one of the year's best. Filmed for only $3 million (equivalent to $ in today's money) it garnered an estimated gross of more than $141 million ($ in today's money) in the form of theatrical rentals and home video, not including merchandising, making it the highest grossing comedy film of its time.\nThe film, along with 1977's \"The Kentucky Fried Movie\", also directed by Landis, was largely responsible for defining and launching the gross-out film genre, which became one of Hollywood's staples. \"Animal House\" is now regarded as one of the best comedy films of all time.\nIn 2001, the United States Library of Congress deemed \"National Lampoon's Animal House\" \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\" and selected it for preservation in the National Film Registry. It was No. 1 on Bravo's \"100 Funniest Movies\". It was No. 36 on AFI's \"100 Years... 100 Laughs\" list of the 100 best American comedies. In 2008, \"Empire\" magazine selected it as No. 279 of \"The 500 Greatest Movies of All Time\".\nPlot.\nIn the fall of 1962, Faber College freshmen Larry Kroger and Kent Dorfman are seeking to join a fraternity. Finding themselves unwelcome at the exclusive Omega Theta Pi house party, the two visit the derelict Delta Tau Chi house next door. Kent believes that Delta will have to accept him as a \"legacy\" since his older brother was a member. They meet John (\"Bluto\") Blutarsky, chapter president Robert (\"Hoov\") Hoover, charismatic ladies' man Eric (\"Otter\") Stratton, motorcyclist Daniel Simpson (\"D-Day\") Day, Donald (\"Boon\") Schoenstein, and Boon's exasperated girlfriend Katy. Larry and Kent are accepted as Delta pledges and given the fraternity names \"Pinto\" and \"Flounder,\" respectively. Meanwhile, Omega pledge Chip Diller is accepted into the fraternity and given a paddling as part of his initiation.\nThe Delta house is on probation due to regular shenanigans and overall poor academic scores. Wishing to remove the unruly fraternity from Faber's campus, Dean Vernon Wormer elevates the Deltas to \"double secret probation\" and directs Greg Marmalard, the Omega house president, to get fellow Omega and ROTC Cadet Commander Douglas C. Neidermeyer to find a reason to revoke Delta's charter. Various misadventures increase the rivalry between Delta, Omega, and Wormer, including the accidental death of Neidermeyer's horse during a retaliatory prank following the bullying of ROTC member Flounder by Neidermeyer. Unbeknownst to Marmalard, Otter has had an affair with Marmalard's girlfriend, Mandy Pepperidge, a member of the Alpha Delta Pi sorority.\nBluto and D-Day steal the answers to an upcoming midterm exam from the trash, unaware that the Omegas have switched it for a fake. All of the Deltas fail the exam, and their grade-point averages drop so low that Wormer tells them he needs only one more misdemeanor to revoke their charter and have them permanently expelled from campus.\nUndeterred, the Deltas organize a toga party and recruit Pinto and Flounder to shoplift from a supermarket as a fraternity prank. At the market, Pinto meets a young cashier named Clorette and invites her to the party, while Otter flirts with an older woman, who turns out to be Dean Wormer's alcoholic wife Marion. During the toga party, at which Otis Day and the Knights perform, Otter seduces Marion, while Pinto and Clorette make out until she passes out, drunk. Pinto resists the temptation to rape her while she is unconscious and instead delivers her home in a shopping cart. He later discovers that she is the 13-year-old daughter of Carmine DePasto, the corrupt mayor of the city of Faber.\nWormer organizes a kangaroo court led by the Omegas, which revokes the Deltas' charter and confiscates the contents of their house. Otter, Boon, Pinto, and Flounder take a road trip in a Lincoln Continental Flounder has borrowed from his older brother, Fred. After reading about the recent death of a student at a nearby all-female college, Otter poses as her fianc\u00e9 in order to find dates for himself and the others. The ruse works and the Deltas, along with their dates, stop at a club where Otis Day and the Knights are performing, unaware that the clientele is exclusively African-American. Some of the patrons intimidate the Deltas into abandoning their dates and fleeing the club, damaging both their car and several others in the parking lot.\nThe next morning, Boon discovers Katy has spent the night with English professor Dave Jennings. Babs Jansen, herself in love with Marmalard, informs him that Mandy and Otter have been having an affair; Marmalard has Babs lure Otter to a motel where the Omegas ambush and assault him. Due to the Deltas' low midterm grades, Wormer expels them all from Faber and gleefully tells them he has notified their local draft boards that they are now all eligible for military service.\nThe Deltas initially concede defeat until Bluto rallies the fraternity to seek revenge during the annual Homecoming parade. D-Day converts the heavily damaged Lincoln into an armored vehicle, which the Deltas conceal inside a cake-shaped breakaway parade float. The Deltas wreak havoc during the parade and crash into the reviewing stand, toppling the Wormers and DePasto. As Hoover asks the Dean for another chance, an epilogue amidst the chaos reveals the fates of the characters:\nProduction.\nDevelopment.\n\"Animal House\" was the first film produced by \"National Lampoon\", the most popular humor magazine on college campuses in the mid-1970s. The periodical specialized in satirizing politics and popular culture. Many of the magazine's writers were recent college graduates, hence its appeal to students all over the country. Doug Kenney was a \"Lampoon\" writer and the magazine's first editor-in-chief. He graduated from Harvard University in 1969 and had a college experience closer to the Omegas in the film (he had been president of the university's elite Spee Club). Kenney was responsible for the first appearances of three characters that appeared in the film: Larry Kroger, Mandy Pepperidge, and Vernon Wormer. They made their debut in 1973's \"National Lampoon's High School Yearbook\", a satire of a Middle America 1964 high school yearbook. Kroger's and Pepperidge's characters in the yearbook were effectively the same as their characters in the movie, whereas Vernon Wormer was a P.E. and civics teacher as well as an athletic coach in the yearbook.\nHowever, Kenney felt that fellow \"Lampoon\" writer Chris Miller was the magazine's expert on the college experience. Faced with an impending deadline, Miller submitted a chapter from his then-abandoned memoirs entitled \"The Night of the Seven Fires\" about pledging experiences from his fraternity days in Alpha Delta (associated with the national Alpha Delta Phi during Miller's undergraduate years; the fraternity subsequently disassociated itself from the national organization and is now called Alpha Delta) at Dartmouth College, in Hanover, New Hampshire. The antics of his fellow fraternities, coupled with experiences like that of a road trip to the University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison and its Delta Chi fraternity, became the inspiration for the Delta Tau Chis of \"Animal House\", and many characters in the film (and their nicknames) were based on Miller's fraternity brothers. Filmmaker Ivan Reitman had just finished producing David Cronenberg's first film, \"Shivers\", and called the magazine's publisher Matty Simmons about making movies under the \"Lampoon\" banner. Reitman had put together \"The National Lampoon Show\" in New York City featuring several future \"Saturday Night Live\" cast members, including John Belushi. When most of the \"Lampoon\" group moved on to \"SNL\" except for Harold Ramis, Reitman approached him with an idea to make a film together using some skits from the \"Lampoon Show\".\nScreenplay.\nKenney met \"Lampoon\" writer Ramis at the suggestion of Simmons. Ramis drew from his own fraternity experiences as a member of Zeta Beta Tau fraternity at Washington University in St. Louis and was working on a film treatment about college called \"First Year\", but the magazine's editors were not happy with it. The famous scene of Bruce McGill as D-Day riding a motorcycle up the stairs of the fraternity house was inspired by Belushi's antics while a student at the University of Wisconsin\u2013Whitewater. Kenney and Ramis started working on a new film treatment together, positing Charles Manson in a high school, calling it \"Laser Orgy Girls\". Simmons disliked this idea so they changed the setting to a \"northeastern college\u00a0... Ivy League kind of school\". Kenney was a fan of Miller's fraternity stories and suggested using them as a basis for a movie. Kenney, Miller, and Ramis began brainstorming ideas. They saw the film's 1962 setting as \"the last innocent year\u00a0... of America\", and the homecoming parade that ends the film as occurring on November 21, 1963, the day before President Kennedy's assassination; 1962 was also notable for being the year 1973 film \"American Graffiti\" was set in. They agreed that Belushi should star in it and Ramis wrote the part of Bluto specifically for the comedian, having been friends with him while at Chicago's The Second City.\nRamis, Miller, and Kenney were all new to screenwriting, so their film treatment ran to 110 pages, where most treatments average 15 pages. Reitman and Simmons pitched it to every Hollywood studio. Simmons met with Ned Tanen, an executive at Universal Pictures. He was encouraged by younger executives Sean Daniel and Thom Mount who were more receptive to the Lampoon type of humor; Mount had discovered the \"Seven Fires\" film treatment as Tanen's assistant while investigating projects left by a fired studio executive. Tanen hated the idea. Ramis remembers, \"We went further than I think Universal expected or wanted. I think they were shocked and appalled. Chris' fraternity had virtually been a vomiting cult. And we had a lot of scenes that were almost orgies of vomit\u00a0... We didn't back off anything\". The writers eventually created nine drafts of the screenplay, and the studio gradually became more receptive to the project, especially Mount, who championed it. The studio greenlit the film and set the budget at a modest $3 million. Simmons remembers, \"They just figured, 'Screw it, it's a silly little movie, and we'll make a couple of bucks if we're lucky\u2014let them do whatever they want.'\"\nCasting.\nInitially, Reitman had wanted to direct but had made only one film, \"Cannibal Girls\", for $5,000. The film's producers approached Richard Lester and Bob Rafelson before hiring John Landis, who got the director job based on his work on \"Kentucky Fried Movie\". That film's script and continuity supervisor was the girlfriend of Sean Daniel, an assistant to Mount. Daniel saw Landis's movie and recommended him. Landis then met with Mount, Reitman, and Simmons and got the job. Landis remembered, \"When I was given the script, it was the funniest thing I had ever read up to that time. But it was really offensive. There was a great deal of projectile vomiting and rape and all these things\". Landis claims his big contribution to the film was that there \"had to be good guys and bad guys. There can't just be bad guys, so there became a good fraternity and bad fraternity\". There was also early friction between Landis and the writers because the director was a high-school dropout from Hollywood and they were all college graduates from the East Coast. Ramis recalled, \"He sort of referred immediately to \"Animal House\" as 'my movie.' We'd been living with it for two years and we hated that\". According to Landis, he drew inspiration from classic Hollywood comedies featuring the likes of Buster Keaton, Harold Lloyd, and the Marx Brothers.\nThe initial cast was to feature Chevy Chase as Otter, Bill Murray as Boon, Brian Doyle-Murray as Hoover, Dan Aykroyd as D-Day, and John Belushi as Bluto, but only Belushi was interested. Chase turned the film down in favor of \"Foul Play\"; Landis, who wanted to cast unknown dramatic actors such as Bacon and Allen (the first film for both) instead of famous comedians, takes credit for subtly discouraging Chase by describing the cast as an \"ensemble\". Landis has also stated that he was not interested in directing a \"\"Saturday Night Live\" movie\" and that unknowns would be the better choice. The character of D-Day was based on Aykroyd, a motorcycle aficionado. Aykroyd was offered the part, but he was already committed to \"Saturday Night Live\"; according to Landis, the show's producer Lorne Michaels threatened to fire Aykroyd from the show's cast if he took the role of D-Day, which ultimately went to Bruce McGill and provided him with his breakthrough role. In August 2018, Aykroyd explained that although Michaels permitted him to do \"Animal House\", he ultimately chose to stay behind on \"Saturday Night Live\" so as not to leave Michaels understaffed. Belushi, who had worked on \"The National Lampoon Radio Hour\" before \"Saturday Night Live\", was also busy with SNL, but spent Monday through Wednesday making the film and then flew back to New York to do the show on Thursday through Saturday. Ramis originally wrote the role of Boon for himself, but Landis felt that he looked too old for the part and Peter Riegert was cast instead. Landis offered Ramis a smaller part, but he declined. Landis met with Jack Webb to play Dean Wormer and Kim Novak to play his wife; at the time, Webb reportedly turned down the role because of concerns over his clean-cut \"Dragnet\" image, but later said he did not find the script funny. Landis had seen John Vernon in \"The Outlaw Josey Wales\" and liked his performance in the film. Landis ultimately cast him as Dean Wormer.\nBelushi initially received only $35,000 for \"Animal House\", but was paid a bonus after the film became a hit. Landis also met with Meat Loaf in case Belushi turned down the role of Bluto. Landis worked with Belushi on his character, who \"hardly had any dialogue\"; they decided that Bluto was a cross between Harpo Marx and the Cookie Monster. Belushi said he developed his ability to communicate without talking because his Albanian grandmother spoke little English.\nAt the time, Belushi was considered a supporting actor and Universal wanted another star. In 1969, Landis had been a crew member on the film \"Kelly's Heroes\" and had become friends with actor Donald Sutherland; Landis sometimes would babysit his son Kiefer. He had also just worked with him on \"Kentucky Fried Movie\". Landis asked Sutherland, one of the most popular film stars of the early 1970s, to be in the movie. For two days of work, Sutherland declined the initial offer of $20,000 plus \"points\" (a percentage of the gross or net income). Universal then offered him his day rate of $25,000 or 2% of the film's gross. Sutherland took the guaranteed fee, assuming that the film would not be very successful; although this made him the highest-paid member of the cast (Belushi and Neidermeyer's horse, Junior, each received $40,000), the decision cost Sutherland what he estimates at around $14 million. The star's participation, however, was crucial; Landis later said \"It was Donald Sutherland who essentially got the film made.\"\n\"Pinto\" was screenwriter Chris Miller's nickname at his Dartmouth fraternity. DeWayne Jessie adopted the \"Otis Day\" name in his private life and continued touring with the band.\nLocations.\nThe filmmakers' next problem was finding a college that would let them shoot the film on their campus. Because it was set in the past, they needed a location with a classic look, so submitted the script to several colleges and universities but \"nobody wanted this movie\" due to the script. According to Landis, \"I couldn't find 'the look'. Every place that had 'the look' said, 'no thank you.'\" The University of Missouri (Columbia, Missouri) gave consent to shoot the movie at the college, but President Herbert W. Schooling withdrew permission to film there after reading the script.\nThe president of the University of Oregon in Eugene, William Beaty Boyd, had been a senior administrator at the University of California in Berkeley in 1966 when his campus was considered for a location of the film \"The Graduate\". After he consulted with other senior administrative colleagues who advised him to turn it down due to the lack of artistic merit, the college campus scenes set at Berkeley were shot at USC in Los Angeles. The film went on to become a classic, and Boyd was determined not to make the same mistake twice when the producers inquired about filming in Oregon. After consulting with student government leaders and officers of the Pan Hellenic Council, the Director of University Relations advised the president that the script, although raunchy and often tasteless, was a very funny spoof of college life. Boyd even allowed the filmmakers to use his office as Dean Wormer's. Because of the film's content, however, he insisted that \"Oregon\" not be mentioned in the film. The filmmakers paid $20,000 to use the campus.\nThe actual house depicted as the Delta House was originally a residence near the campus in Eugene, the Dr. A.W. Patterson House. Around 1959, it was acquired by the Psi Deuteron chapter of Phi Sigma Kappa fraternity and was their chapter house until 1967, when the chapter was closed due to low membership. The house was sold, remained vacant, and slid into disrepair, with the spacious porch removed and the lawn graveled over. At the time of the shooting, the Phi Kappa Psi and Sigma Nu fraternity houses sat next to the old Phi Sigma Kappa house, on the 700 block of East 11th Avenue. The interior of the Phi Kappa Psi house and the Sigma Nu house were used for most of the interior scenes, but the scenes in Otter and Hoover's bedrooms were filmed on a soundstage. The Patterson house remained vacant after filming ended in 1977 and was demolished in 1986, despite some attempts to preserve it due to its connection to the film. The site () is now occupied by Bushnell University's School of Education and Counseling. A large boulder placed to the west of the parking entrance displays a bronze plaque commemorating the Delta House location. The concluding parade scene was filmed on Main Street in downtown Cottage Grove, about south of Eugene via Interstate 5.\nPrincipal photography.\nFilming began on October 24, 1977, and concluded in the middle of December 1977. and Landis brought the actors who played the Deltas up five days early to bond. Staying at the Rodeway Inn motel in adjacent Springfield, they moved an old piano from the lobby into McGill's room, which became known as \"party central.\" James Widdoes (\"Hoover\") remembers, \"It was like freshman orientation. There was a lot of getting to know each other and calling each other by our character names.\" This tactic encouraged the actors playing the Deltas to separate themselves from the actors playing the Omegas, helping generate authentic animosity between them on camera. Belushi and his wife Judy rented a house in south Eugene to keep him away from alcohol and drugs; she remained in Oregon while he commuted to New York City for \"Saturday Night Live\".\nUniversity of Oregon students got haircuts to appear as extras. Not knowing the story, they were bemused to see a horse being led into Johnson Hall. Although the cast members were admonished against mixing with the college students, one night, some girls invited several of the cast to a fraternity party; assuming the invitation had been made with the knowledge of the fraternity, the actors arrived and were initially greeted coldly which soon turned to open hostility. It was obvious the group was not welcome, and as they were leaving, Widdoes threw a cup of beer at a group of drunk Oregon Ducks football players and a melee \"like a scene from the movie\" broke out. Tim Matheson, Bruce McGill, Peter Riegert, and Widdoes narrowly escaped, with McGill suffering a black eye and Widdoes getting several teeth broken or knocked out.\nOther than Belushi's opening yell, the food fight was filmed in one shot, with the actors encouraged to fight for real. Flounder's dexterous catching of flying groceries in the supermarket was another single shot; Furst deftly caught most of the grocery items Matheson and Landis rapidly threw at him from off camera, to the director's amazement. By filming the long courtroom scene in one day, Landis won a bet with Reitman.\nThe film's budget was so small that during the 32 days of shooting in Eugene, mostly in November, Landis had no trailer or office and could not watch dailies for three weeks. His wife Deborah Nadoolman purchased most of the costumes at local thrift stores, and she and Judy Belushi made the party togas. Landis and Bruce McGill staged a scene for reporters visiting the set where the director pretended to be angry at the actor for being difficult on the set. Landis grabbed a breakaway pitcher and smashed it over McGill's head. He fell to the ground and pretended to be unconscious. The reporters were completely fooled, and when Landis asked McGill to get up, he refused to move.\nBlack extras had to be bused in from Portland for the segment at the Dexter Lake Club () due to their scarcity around Eugene. More seriously, the segment alarmed Tanen and other studio executives, who perceived it as racist and warned that \"'black people in America are going to rip the seats out of theaters if you leave that scene in the movie.'\" Richard Pryor's approval helped retain the segment in the film. The studio became more enthusiastic about the film when Reitman showed executives and sales managers of various regions in the country a 10-minute production reel that was put together in two days. The reaction was positive and the studio sent 20 copies out to exhibitors. The first preview screening for \"Animal House\" was held in Denver four months before it opened nationwide. The crowd loved it and the filmmakers realized they had a potential hit on their hands.\nThe original cut of the movie was a lengthy 175 minutes and more than an hour was dropped; the deleted scenes included:\nSoundtrack and score.\nThe soundtrack is a mix of rock and roll and rhythm and blues with the original score created by film composer Elmer Bernstein, who had been a Landis family friend since John Landis was a child. Bernstein was easily persuaded to score the film, but he was not sure what to make of it. Similar to his preferring dramatic actors for the comedy, Landis asked Bernstein to score it as though it were serious. He adapted the \"Faber College Theme\" from the \"Academic Festival Overture\" by Brahms, and he said that the film opened yet another door in his diverse career: scoring comedies.\nThe soundtrack was released as an LP in 1978 and on compact disc in 1998. In the late 2000s, the very first song on the soundtrack, the \"Faber College Theme\", came to prominence due to its purported resemblance to the Bosnian national anthem.\nReception.\nCritical reception.\nAt the time of its release, \"Animal House\" received mixed reviews but several prominent critics immediately acknowledged its appeal, and it has since been recognized as one of the best films of 1978. The film holds a 91% positive rating on the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes from 53 critics. Its consensus states, \"The talents of director John Landis and \"Saturday Night Live\"'s irrepressible John Belushi conspired to create a rambunctious, subversive college comedy that continues to resonate.\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 79 out of 100 based on 13 reviews, indicating \"generally favorable\" reviews.\nRoger Ebert gave the film four stars out of four and wrote, \"It's anarchic, messy, and filled with energy. It assaults us. Part of the movie's impact comes from its sheer level of manic energy. ... But the movie's better made (and better acted) than we might at first realize. It takes skill to create this sort of comic pitch, and the movie's filled with characters that are sketched a little more absorbingly than they had to be, and acted with perception\". Ebert later placed the film on his 10 best list of 1978, the only \"National Lampoon\" film to have received this honor. In his review for \"Time\", Frank Rich wrote, \"At its best it perfectly expresses the fears and loathings of kids who came of age in the late '60s; at its worst \"Animal House\" revels in abject silliness. The hilarious highs easily compensate for the puerile lows\". Gary Arnold wrote in his review for \"The Washington Post\", \"Belushi also controls a wicked array of conspiratorial expressions with the audience... He can seem irresistibly funny in repose or invest minor slapstick opportunities with a streak of genius\". David Ansen wrote in \"Newsweek\", \"But if \"Animal House\" lacks the inspired tastelessness of the Lampoon's \"High School Yearbook Parody\", this is still low humor of a high order\". Robert Martin wrote in \"The Globe and Mail\", \"It is so gross and tasteless you feel you should be disgusted but it's hard to be offended by something that is so sidesplittingly funny\". \"Time\" magazine proclaimed \"Animal House\" one of the year's best.\nWhen the film was released, Landis, Widdoes, and Allen went on a national promotional tour. Universal Pictures spent about $4.5 million ($ in today's money) promoting the film at selected college campuses and helped students organize their own toga parties. One such party at the University of Maryland attracted some 2,000 people, while students at the University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison tried for a crowd of 10,000 people and a place in the \"Guinness Book of World Records\". Thanks to the film, toga parties became one of the favorite college campus happenings during 1978 and 1979.\nIn 2000, the American Film Institute placed the film on its 100 Years...100 Laughs list, where it was ranked No. 36. In 2005, AFI ranked John \"Bluto\" Blutarsky's quote \"Toga! Toga!\" at No. 82 on its list of 100 Years...100 Movie Quotes. \"The New York Times\" placed the film on its \"Best 1000 Movies Ever\" list. In 2001, the Library of Congress deemed the film to be \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\" and selected it as one of 25 films preserved in the National Film Registry that year.\nBox office.\nIn its opening weekend, \"Animal House\" grossed $276,538 in twelve theaters in New York before expanding to 500 theaters. It grossed $120.1 million ($ in today's money) in the United States and Canada in its initial release and went on to achieve a lifetime gross of $141.6 million, generating theatrical rentals of $70.8 million. It was the highest grossing comedy film until the release of \"Ghostbusters\" (which was also written by Ramis and produced by Reitman) and the seventh highest-grossing film of the 1970s. Adjusted for inflation, it is the 68th highest-grossing film in North America. Internationally, it did not do as well, earning rentals of only $9 million, for a worldwide total of $80 million.\nSpin-offs.\nThe film inspired a short-lived half-hour ABC television sitcom, \"Delta House\", in which Vernon reprised his role as the long-suffering, malevolent Dean Wormer. The series also included Furst as Flounder, McGill as D-Day, and Widdoes as Hoover. The pilot episode was written by the film's screenwriters, Kenney, Miller, and Ramis. Michelle Pfeiffer made her acting debut in the series (playing a new character, \"Bombshell\"), and Peter Fox was cast as Otter. Belushi's character from the film, John \"Bluto\" Blutarsky, is in the Army, but his brother, Blotto, played by Josh Mostel, transfers to Faber to carry on Bluto's tradition.\n\"Animal House\" inspired \"Co-Ed Fever\", another sitcom but without the involvement of the film's producers or cast. Set in a dorm of the formerly all-female Baxter College, the pilot of \"Co-Ed Fever\" was aired by CBS on February 4, 1979, but the network canceled the series before airing any more episodes. NBC also had its \"Animal House\"-inspired sitcom, \"Brothers and Sisters\", in which three members of Crandall College's Pi Nu fraternity interact with members of the Gamma Iota sorority. Like ABC's \"Delta House\", \"Brothers and Sisters\" lasted only three months.\nThe film's writers planned a film sequel set in 1967 (the so-called \"Summer of Love\"), in which the Deltas have a reunion for Pinto's marriage in Haight-Ashbury, San Francisco. The only Delta to have become a hippie is Flounder, who is now called Pisces. Later, Chris Miller and John Weidman, another Lampoon writer, created a treatment for this screenplay, but Universal rejected it because the sequel to \"American Graffiti\", which contained some hippie-1967 sequences, had not done well. When John Belushi died, the idea was indefinitely shelved.\nA second attempt at a sequel was made in 1982 with producer Matty Simmons co-authoring a script that saw some of the Deltas returning to Faber College five years after the events of the film. The project got no further than a first draft script.\nHome media.\n\"Animal House\" was released on videodisc in 1979. It was released on VHS in 1980, 1983, 1988, and 1990. In 1992, it was released in a 2-pack VHS set that included \"The Blues Brothers\". It was first released on DVD in February 1998 in a \"bare bones\" Full Screen presentation. A 20th Anniversary Widescreen Collector's Edition DVD and a coinciding THX special edition VHS and a widescreen Signature Collection Laserdisc was released later that year, with a 45-minute documentary titled \"The Yearbook\u00a0\u2014 An \"Animal House\" Reunion\" by producer J.M. Kenny, with production notes, theatrical trailer, and new interviews with director Landis, writers Harold Ramis and Chris Miller, composer Elmer Bernstein, and stars Tim Matheson, Karen Allen, Stephen Furst, John Vernon, Verna Bloom, Bruce McGill, James Widdoes, Peter Riegert, Mark Metcalf and Kevin Bacon. In 2000, the collector's edition DVD was packaged along with \"The Blues Brothers\" and \"1941\" in a John Belushi 3-pack box set. The \"Double Secret Probation Edition\" DVD released in 2003 features cast members reprising their respective roles in a \"Where Are They Now?\" mockumentary, which posited the original film as a documentary. One major change shown in this mockumentary from the epilogue of the original film is that Bluto went on from his career in the U.S. Senate to become the President of the United States, with a voiceover on a shot of the north portico of the White House, since by then Belushi had died. This DVD also includes \"Did You Know That? Universal Animated Anecdotes\", a subtitle trivia track, the making of a documentary from the Collector's Edition, MxPx \"Shout\" music video, a theatrical trailer, production notes, and cast and filmmakers biographies. The DVD was also available in both Widescreen and Full-Screen formats. In August 2006, the film was released on an HD DVD/DVD combo disc, which featured the film in a 1080p high-definition format on one side, and a standard-definition format on the opposite side. Along with the film \"Unleashed\", \"Animal House\" was one of Universal's first two HD/DVD combo releases, but was later discontinued in 2008 after Universal decided to switch to the Blu-ray optical disc format following the conclusion of the high-definition optical disc format war.\nIt became available on Blu-ray optical disc on July 26, 2011.\nThe film was released on 4K on May 18, 2021.\nPrecursors and legacy.\n\"Animal House\" was a great box office success despite its limited production costs and started an industry trend, inspiring other comedies such as \"Porky's\", the \"Police Academy\" films, the \"American Pie\" films, \"Up the Academy\" (made by rival humor magazine \"MAD\"), and \"Old School\" among others. Belushi became the most successful male comedy star in the world until his 1982 death; Bacon also became a star, and he, Matheson, and Allen are among those who have had lengthy acting careers. Reitman, Landis, and Ramis became successful filmmakers; Landis' use of dramatic actors and soundtrack to make the comedy believable became the traditional approach for film comedies.\nThe film has caused many parents to worry about their children joining fraternities and sororities. One writer suggested, half-seriously, that the film's impact was such that future college students seeking to emulate Delta House's antics in real life led to \"a drop of American college students' GPA's an average of .18 grade points, per semester\".\nOn the left-wing and counterculture side, the film included references to topical political matters like President Harry S. Truman's decision to drop atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Richard Nixon, the Vietnam War, and the civil rights movement. Precursors of this counterculture subversive humor in the film were two non-\"college movies\", \"M*A*S*H\", a 1970 satirical dark comedy, and \"The Kentucky Fried Movie\", a 1977 formless comedy consisting of a series of sketches (which was also directed by Landis).\nAt the start of \"\" (1983), also directed by John Landis, a scene set in Vietnam includes a soldier saying \"I told you guys, we shouldn't have shot Lieutenant Neidermeyer.\"\nTwisted Sister lead singer Dee Snider has cited the movie to be one of his favorites. Several references to the movie are included in two Twisted Sister music videos in 1984: \"We're Not Gonna Take It\" and \"I Wanna Rock\". Both music videos feature Mark Metcalf, playing a stern authority figure with a personality similar to Neidermeyer. In \"We're Not Gonna Take It\", Metcalf plays a stern father named Douglas C., who gives his rebellious son a dressing-down, in a manner similar to Neidermeyer does to Flounder during the cadet inspection, including calling him \"worthless and weak\". In \"I Wanna Rock\", Metcalf plays a teacher, who confronts a student for having a Twisted Sister logo drawn on his textbook, saying \"What kind of a man desecrates a defenseless textbook? I've got a good mind to slap your fat face!\" (echoing Neidermeyer's line \"What kind of man hits a defenseless animal? I've got a good mind to smash your fat face in!\" At the end of the video, he crawls into the office of the principal, played by fellow Animal House actor Stephen Furst, who reprises one of his lines from the movie \"Oh boy, is this great!\"\nIn the second season of the Canadian television series \"Relic Hunter\" (2000\u20132001), Sydney's boss at Trinity College is named Dean Wormer.\nIn 2001, the United States Library of Congress deemed the film \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\" and selected it for preservation in the National Film Registry. \"Animal House\" is first on Bravo's 100 Funniest Movies. In 2000, the American Film Institute ranked the film No. 36 on \"100 Years... 100 Laughs\", a list of the 100 best American comedies. In 2006, Miller wrote a more comprehensive memoir of his experiences in Dartmouth's AD house in a book entitled, \"The Real Animal House: The Awesomely Depraved Saga of the Fraternity That Inspired the Movie\", in which Miller recounts hijinks that were considered too risqu\u00e9 for the movie. In 2008, \"Empire\" magazine selected \"Animal House\" as one of \"The 500 Greatest Movies of All Time\". The film was also selected by \"The New York Times\" as one of \"The 1000 Best Movies Ever Made\".\nIn 2012, Universal Pictures Stage Productions announced it was developing a stage musical version of the movie. Barenaked Ladies were originally announced to write the score, but they were replaced by composer David Yazbek. Casey Nicholaw was billed to direct; author Michael Mitnick was reported to be involved.\nThe University of Oregon celebrates its participation in the film. It offers visitors a guide to filming locations, and the Knight Library has a collection of material on the film's production. Between the third and fourth quarter of every football game at Autzen Stadium, \"Shout\" from the toga party scene is played, to which the entire stadium sings along.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It was the first of five films the Marx Brothers made under contract for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer after their departure from Paramount Pictures, and the first after Zeppo left the act. The film was written by George S. Kaufman and Morrie Ryskind from a story by James Kevin McGuinness, with additional uncredited dialogue by Al Boasberg. The film was directed by Sam Wood.\nOne of MGM's biggest hits at the 1935 box office, \"A Night at the Opera\" was selected in 1993 for preservation in the National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\". It is also included in the 2007 update of AFI's 100 Years... 100 Movies, at number 85; and previously in AFI's 100 Years...100 Laughs 2000 showing, at number 12.\nPlot.\nAt a restaurant in Milan, Italy, wealthy widow Mrs. Claypool has apparently been stood up for dinner by her business manager, Otis B. Driftwood. After she discovers him dining with another woman and seated directly behind her, Driftwood joins Mrs. Claypool and soon introduces her to Herman Gottlieb, director of the New York Opera Company, also dining at the restaurant. Driftwood has arranged for Mrs. Claypool to invest $200,000 in the opera company, allowing Gottlieb enough money to engage Italian tenor Rodolfo Lassparri, the \"greatest tenor since Caruso\".\nBackstage at the opera house, chorister Ricardo Baroni hires his best friend Fiorello to be his manager. Ricardo is in love with the soprano, Rosa Castaldi, who is also being courted by Lassparri. Driftwood arrives backstage and finds Lassparri attacking Tomasso, his dresser; Tomasso knocks Lassparri unconscious by hitting him over the head with a mallet. Fiorello appears and introduces himself to Driftwood as the manager of the \"greatest tenor in the world\". Driftwood believes Fiorello is referring to Lassparri (who is still lying unconscious at their feet) and unwittingly signs Ricardo to a contract.\nSoon, Driftwood, Mrs. Claypool, Rosa, Lassparri and Gottlieb all set sail from Italy to New York aboard an ocean liner. After bidding farewell to Rosa at the pier, Ricardo, Fiorello, and Tomasso stow away inside Driftwood's steamer trunk. After being discovered, Driftwood attempts to get the three of them to leave before Mrs. Claypool arrives in his stateroom for a rendezvous. Fiorello refuses to leave until the trio have eaten, and eventually Driftwood's very small stateroom is crowded with an assortment of people. (See \"Stateroom scene\" below.)\nLater, Lassparri spots the three stowaways among the Italian immigrants on the ship, and they are caught and thrown into the brig. They escape with Driftwood's help and are able to sneak into the country by posing as three famous bearded aviators, who are traveling aboard the ship. During a hero's welcome in New York, the stowaways are exposed as frauds and they flee, hiding out in Driftwood's hotel room while pursued by police sergeant Henderson.\nMeanwhile, Rosa and Ricardo are reunited when he climbs through the window of her hotel room. Lassparri appears, and after a physical altercation with Ricardo, both Rosa and Driftwood are fired from the opera company by Gottlieb. Driftwood, Fiorello, and Tomasso decide to seek revenge by sabotaging the opera company's opening night performance of \"Il trovatore\" with various antics, climaxing with the abduction of Lassparri from the stage, forcing Gottlieb to substitute Ricardo in his place. Ricardo accepts on the condition Rosa substitutes for the female lead as well. Mrs. Claypool and the audience clearly prefer Ricardo over Lassparri, and the latter is booed and hit with an apple after he is untied and attempts to return to the stage. The film ends with Driftwood and Fiorello negotiating another contract as Rosa and Ricardo sing an encore.\nCast.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-begin/styles.css\"/&gt;\nSelected sequences.\nStateroom.\nThis scene was written primarily by legendary gag man Al Boasberg. Famously eccentric, Boasberg typed up the finished scene, then shredded the pages into thin pieces and tacked them to his ceiling. It took Irving Thalberg and the brothers hours to cut and paste the scene back together.\nDriftwood plans a rendezvous with Mrs. Claypool in his stateroom. Then he finds out how small it is (a third class cabin, about the size of a janitor's closet), and that he, his steamer trunk, and the bed barely fit in it. Driftwood discovers that Fiorello, Tomasso, and Ricardo have stowed away in his steamer trunk and discarded his clothes. Fiorello insists on eating (\"We getta food or we don't go\"). Driftwood calls a steward (\"I say, Stew\") and orders dinner.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;&lt;poem&gt;\nDriftwood: And two medium-boiled eggs.\nFiorello: \"(inside room)\": And two hard-boiled eggs.\nDriftwood: And two hard-boiled eggs.\nTomasso: \"(inside room)\": (honk)\nDriftwood: Make that \"three\" hard boiled eggs.\n&lt;/poem&gt;\nThis continues until Fiorello and Tomasso each have ordered about a dozen hard-boiled eggs and Driftwood has ordered about everything else \u2013 including coffee to sober up some stewed prunes. This is just a set-up for the famous \"Stateroom Scene\", in which a total of 15 people crowd into Driftwood's tiny cabin.\nThe three stowaways have to hide out in the room while a parade of people walk in, asking to either use the cabin, or to perform their regular duties. Crammed into this little space at the end of the scene are Driftwood, Fiorello, Tomasso, Ricardo, two cleaning ladies who make up the bed, a manicurist (Manicurist: \"Do you want your nails long or short?\" Driftwood: \"You better make them short, it's getting kind of crowded in here!\"), a ship's engineer and his fat assistant, a young woman passenger using the phone to call her Aunt Minnie, a maid (Maid: \"I come to mop up.\" Driftwood: \"You'll have to start on the ceiling.\") and four waiters with trays of hard-boiled eggs.\n(Driftwood: \"Tell Aunt Minnie to send up a bigger room.\") All of the foregoing tumble out into the hallway when Mrs. Claypool opens the door.\nContract.\nThe contract scene between Driftwood and Fiorello (\"the party of the first part ...\"):\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;&lt;poem&gt;\nFiorello: Hey, wait, wait. What does this say here, this thing here?\nDriftwood: Oh, that? Oh, that's the usual clause that's in every contract. That just says, it says, 'if any of the parties participating in this contract are shown not to be in their right mind, the entire agreement is automatically nullified'.\nFiorello: Well, I don't know...\nDriftwood: It's all right, that's in every contract. That's, that's what they call a sanity clause.\nFiorello: Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha! You can't fool me. There \"ain't\" no Sanity Clause!\n&lt;/poem&gt;\nOpera.\nTrue to its title, the film includes adaptations of some real opera scenes from \"I Pagliacci\" and \"Il Trovatore\", featuring the \"Miserere\" duet sung by Kitty Carlisle and Allan Jones. The opera setting also allowed MGM to add big production song numbers (which were one of this studio's specialties), such as the song \"Alone\", with the departure of the steamship, and the song \"Cosi Cosa\" with the Italian buffet and dancing.\nCarlisle and Jones were both trained in operatic singing and provided their own singing voices in the film. Walter Woolf King was a trained baritone, but he portrayed a tenor in the film. His singing was dubbed by Metropolitan Opera tenor Tandy MacKenzie.\nHidden material.\nIn the scene where the three stowaways are impersonating \"the three greatest aviators in the world\", Driftwood seems to talk gibberish with the dignitaries. Actually it is English; if played backwards, it can be heard what they are saying (\"This man is accusing you of being impostors\", etc.). It was recorded normally, then reversed and dubbed over the scene in post-production.\nProduction.\nIn an interview with Richard J. Anobile in \"The Marx Brothers Scrapbook\", Groucho said he was so appalled by an early draft of the script\u2014which was apparently written by Bert Kalmar and Harry Ruby\u2014that he shouted, \"Why fuck around with second-rate talent, get Kaufman and Ryskind [to write the screenplay]!\" \nAt the suggestion of producer Irving Thalberg, the film marked a change of direction in the brothers' career. In their Paramount films, the brothers' characters were much more anarchic: they attacked almost anybody who was so unfortunate as to cross their paths whether they deserved it or not, albeit comically. Thalberg, however, felt that this made the brothers unsympathetic, particularly to female filmgoers. So in the MGM films, the brothers were recast as more helpful characters, saving most of their comic attacks for the villains.\nThough some Marx Brothers fans disliked these changes, Thalberg was vindicated when the film became a solid hit. It helped that the film contained some of what fans consider to be among the brothers' funniest and most memorable routines. These routines were carefully honed in a series of live stage performances, as the brothers took to the road and performed the new material around the country before filming began.\nHowever, according to Oscar Levant, the first preview of the finished film in Long Beach was a \"disaster\", with \"hardly a laugh\" as was the second. Thalberg and George S. Kaufman spent days in the editing room, adjusting the timing to match the rhythm of a stage performance. About nine minutes was cut from the running time, and the result was a hit.\nSubsequent re-editing.\nThe film originally was to have begun with each of the Marx Brothers taking turns roaring instead of Leo the Lion (MGM's iconic mascot); Harpo was to have honked his horn. This unique opening was created, but not used in the released film because MGM studio head Louis B. Mayer felt the parody would cheapen the respected trademark. It turned up years later, however, in a re-release trailer for the film.\nAccording to MGM's dialogue cutting continuity and Leonard Maltin's audio commentary on the DVD release, the film originally began (after the opening credits) with the image of a \"boat on canal\". A superimposed title read, \"ITALY \u2013 WHERE THEY SING ALL DAY AND GO TO THE OPERA AT NIGHT\", and was followed by a musical number featuring bits and pieces from Leoncavallo's \"Pagliacci\" performed by \"everyday\" Italians: a street sweeper sings part of the prologue (\"Un nido di memorie...\") as he greets a man who then hands out opera tickets to a group of children emerging from a store; the children respond with \"la-la-la-la-la, verso un paese strano\" (from \"Stridono lass\u00f9\"); a \"captain\" comes down a set of steps, salutes a sentry, then bursts into \"Vesti la giubba\"; then, a lap dissolve into a hotel lobby, where a \"baggage man\" is rolling a trunk and crooning about \"nettare divino\" (\"divine nectar\"); a waiter joins the baggage man in song, enters the dining room, and sings as he serves a man who for a few notes also sings; the waiter then crosses the dining room to speak to Mrs. Claypool (Margaret Dumont), marking the beginning of the film in existing copies.\nIn his commentary, Maltin repeats an assertion originally made by Glenn Mitchell in \"The Marx Brothers Encyclopedia\" that the scene was cut during World War II to remove references to Italy. However, according to MPAA records, the film was re-edited by MGM in 1938, prior to the war, because of complaints from the Italian government that it \"made fun of Italian people\". Unfortunately, the edits were made to MGM's master negative, and no prints of the original uncut version are known to survive.\nThis notable cut, with several other small ones made at about the same time, is why the stated running time of the film (95 minutes) was three minutes longer than that of existing prints.\nA persistent rumor concerning \"A Night at the Opera\" involves the presence of the Marx Brothers' father Sam Marx (also known as \"Frenchy\") on the ship and on the dock, waving goodbye. Both Groucho and Harpo stated this as fact in their memoirs, and film critic Leonard Maltin repeats it in the DVD commentary. But this could not have occurred, because Sam Marx had died in 1933, during pre-production of \"Duck Soup\", two years before \"A Night at the Opera\" was released. The rumor arose because Frenchy had had such a cameo appearance in the Marx Brothers' earlier film \"Monkey Business\". There is, however, a reference to the Marx Brothers' mother, Minnie Marx, during the stateroom scene, in which a woman asks, \"Is my Aunt Minnie in here?\"\nPart of the concept of casting the Marx Brothers as stowaways on a ship was recycled from \"Monkey Business\". As Groucho's and Margaret Dumont's characters are boarding the ocean liner, Dumont asks Groucho, \"Are you sure you have everything, Otis?\"; Groucho replies, \"I've never had any complaints yet.\" In two different interviews with Dick Cavett on \"The Dick Cavett Show \u2013 Comic Legends\" DVD, Groucho claimed that that exchange of dialogue was banned in a majority of states when the film was released because it was too suggestive, although the number of states varied with different versions of the story.\nHungarian rediscovery.\nIn 2008, a film student reported that the Hungarian National Film Archive possesses a longer print of the film. While the print does not contain the opening musical number, it does contain several excised lines referencing Italy that had been cut sometime after the film's original release. With the opening number still missing, it may be that this scene was cut before the subsequent edits were made. However, the discovery of the Hungarian print has not yet been independently verified, and Turner Entertainment, who owns the rights to the film, has not indicated that any restoration is forthcoming.\nStyle change.\n\"A Night at the Opera\" began a new era for the Marx Brothers' style of comedy. Whereas their previous comedies at Paramount Pictures consisted of a constant barrage of jokes within a loosely plotted storyline, \"A Night at the Opera\" was calculated comedy. Producer Irving Thalberg insisted on a strong story structure, making the Brothers more sympathetic characters, interweaving their comedy with romantic plots and non-comic spectacular musical numbers. The targets of their mischief were largely confined to clear villains. Thalberg's logic was that the Marxes could get \"twice the box office with half the laughs\", believing their films would attract a wider audience. Groucho himself agreed with Thalberg's rationale. In his autobiography, \"Groucho and Me\", he wrote of the Marx Brothers' 13 films, \"Two were far above average. Some of the others were pretty good. Some were deplorable. The best two were made by Thalberg\"\u2014a reference not only to \"A Night at the Opera\" but \"A Day at the Races\".\nAnother idea to which Thalberg consented, was that before filming would commence on an upcoming film, the Marx Brothers would try out the new material on the vaudeville stage, working on comic timing and learning which jokes and gags earned a laugh and which did not. Jokes were planted accordingly, so the laughs could be timed correctly. What was to become the famous \"stateroom\" scene was nearly eliminated because it was not getting any laughs. One evening the Marx Brothers threw away the script and ad-libbed the whole scene. As a result, a weak scene was transformed into one of their all-time classics.\nIn \"A Night at the Opera\", each of the brothers' characters was refined: Groucho was somewhat less nonsensical, and less trouble; Chico became less of a scammer and gained \"some\" intelligence; Harpo became less mischievous and more sympathetic. The film dives straight into a plot and accompanying comedy, with every scene having a clear beginning, middle, and end. The end consisted of a grand finale in the traditional MGM musical fashion, something lacking from the brothers' Paramount efforts.\n\"A Night at the Opera\" established a basic formula that was utilized in every subsequent film the Marx Brothers made at MGM:\nRelease.\nBox office.\nThe film grossed a total (domestic and foreign) of $1,815,000: $1,164,000 from the US and Canada and $651,000 elsewhere. It made a profit of $90,000.\nCritical reception.\nContemporary reviews.\n\"A Night at the Opera\" was banned in Budapest.\nContemporary reviews were positive. Andre Sennwald of \"The New York Times\" wrote, \"If 'A Night at the Opera' is a trifle below their best, it is also considerably above the standard of laughter that has been our portion since they quit the screen. George S. Kaufman and Morrie Ryskind have given them a resounding slapstick to play with and they wield it with maniacal delight.\" \"The comedy material is always good and sometimes brilliant\", reported \"Variety\". \"This should be a laugh fest with all types of audiences\", wrote \"Film Daily\". \"This is a good Marx Brothers film, good as any they have done\", wrote John Mosher in \"The New Yorker\". \"It may not be new or surprising, but it's quick and funny.\"\nRetrospective reviews.\nThe film holds a 97% \"fresh\" score at Rotten Tomatoes based on 69 reviews, with an average rating of 8.7/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \"Watermelons may go out of season, but in \"A Night at the Opera\", the Marx Brothers' daffy laughs are never anything less than uproariously fresh.\" Ken Hanke calls it \"hysterical, but not up to the boys' Paramount films.\" Mark Bourne concurs: \"[The Marx Brothers] still let the air out of stuffed shirts and barbecue a few sacred cows, but something got lost in all that MGMness when the screen's ultimate anti-authoritarian team starting working the Andy Hardy side of the street.\"\nRoger Ebert admitted that, while \"A Night at the Opera\" \"contains some of their best work\", he \"fast-forward[ed] over the sappy interludes involving Kitty Carlisle and Allan Jones.\" Danel Griffin says: \"\"A Night at the Opera\" is funny, but this is NOT the Marx Brothers, and their earlier style is so sorely missed that the film falls flat. The main problem with \"A Night at the Opera\" is the obvious lack of the Marx Brothers' trademark anarchy. What distinguished them in their Paramount films from all other comedians was their thumb-biting indictment of society.\"\nThe film is recognized by American Film Institute in these lists:\n Fiorello: \"You can't fool me!

{"id": "75264", "revid": "13390353", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=75264", "title": "The Night of the Hunter (film)", "text": "1955 film by Charles Laughton\nThe Night of the Hunter is a 1955 American horror thriller film directed by Charles Laughton and starring Robert Mitchum, Shelley Winters and Lillian Gish. The screenplay by James Agee was based on the 1953 novel of the same name by Davis Grubb. The plot is about Preacher Harry Powell (Mitchum), a serial killer who poses as a preacher and pursues two children in an attempt to get his hands on $10,000 of stolen cash hidden by their late father.\nThe novel and film draw on the true story of Harry Powers, who was hanged in 1932 for the murder of two widows and three children in Clarksburg, West Virginia. The film's lyrical and expressionistic style, borrowing techniques from silent film, sets it apart from other Hollywood films of the 1940s and 1950s, and it has influenced such later directors as Rainer Werner Fassbinder, Robert Altman, Spike Lee, Martin Scorsese, the Coen brothers, and Guillermo del Toro.\n\"The Night of the Hunter\" premiered on July 26, 1955, in Des Moines, Iowa, to negative reviews. It became the only directorial feature of Laughton. Over the years, the film has been positively reevaluated and is considered one of the greatest films ever made. It was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry in 1992. French film magazine \"Cahiers du Cin\u00e9ma\" selected \"The Night of the Hunter\" in 2008 as the second-best film of all time, behind \"Citizen Kane\".\nPlot.\nHarry Powell is a serial killer and self-proclaimed preacher traveling along the Ohio River in West Virginia during the Great Depression. He is arrested for driving a stolen car and serves thirty days at Moundsville Penitentiary. There he shares a cell with Ben Harper, who killed two men in a bank robbery for $10,000. Harper made his children, John and Pearl, promise to never reveal where he hid the money. Despite Powell's attempts to worm it out of him, Harper takes the secret to his grave when he is hanged for the murders.\nUpon his release from prison, Powell visits Harper's tiny hometown, where he charms the townsfolk and woos Harper's widow, Willa, a waitress for Walter Spoon and his wife, Icey. Overnight, Powell manages to win the town's trust and weds Willa, but John remains instinctively distrustful of him. Powell suspects that John knows where the money is hidden and threatens him to reveal its location. John accidentally reveals that he and Pearl do know where the money is. After Powell refuses to consummate their marriage, Willa deludes herself that he married her to redeem her soul and begins preaching alongside him in tent revivals. She later loses her faith in him when she overhears Powell threatening Pearl to make her reveal where the money is hidden.\nPowell murders Willa and ties her body to a Model T that he sinks in the river, then claims that she left her family for a life of sin when Walter and Icey question her abrupt disappearance. Uncle Birdie, an elderly friend of the family, discovers Willa's body while fishing, but refrains from telling the police for fear that he will be accused of Willa's murder.\nPowell threatens the children and learns the money is hidden inside Pearl's doll. The children escape an enraged Powell and attempt to seek refuge with Birdie, whom they find in a drunken stupor. They use their father's small johnboat to flee down the river and find sanctuary with Rachel Cooper, a tough woman who looks after stray children.\nPowell kills a farmer for his horse and eventually tracks them down, but Rachel sees through his deceptions and runs him off her property with a shotgun. He returns after dark. During an all-night standoff, Rachel gives Powell a face full of birdshot. She summons the state police, who arrive and arrest Powell for Willa's murder. John breaks down during Powell's handcuffing, having a flashback of his father's fate. He beats the doll against Powell's struggling body in anguish, spilling the cash.\nDuring Powell's trial John cannot bring himself to testify against him. After Powell's sentencing, Rachel takes John and the other children away as Icey leads a lynch mob toward the police station. Powell is escorted out the back to safety just in time, but the prison hangman vows to see him again soon. John and Pearl spend their first Christmas together with Rachel and her brood of stray children.\nCast.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;* Robert Mitchum as \"Preacher\" Harry Powell\nProduction.\nThis was the only film solely directed by and credited to the actor Charles Laughton. Laughton, in addition to Irving Allen and Burgess Meredith, directed the film \"The Man on the Eiffel Tower\"; Meredith was the only director credited for the film. Laughton had directed plays on Broadway, most produced by his friend Paul Gregory.\nDevelopment.\nHarold Matson, a literary agent, sent a copy of the 1953 novel \"The Night of the Hunter\" by Davis Grubb to Paul Gregory. He sent the book to Laughton, who loved it and described it as a \"nightmarish Mother Goose story\". Laughton contacted Grubb, and the two of them instantly got along very well. He traveled to Philadelphia, where Grubb lived, and they spent five days discussing ideas for the film. Grubb had studied art in college, so he offered to draw sketches as a form of inspiration. Laughton loved the drawings, and many of them were used in the film's storyboard.\nAt first, Grubb was being considered to write the screenplay himself, but the studio wanted to hire someone with experience writing for films. James Agee was hired as the screenwriter because he was from the South and had experience writing about the Depression. Agee began writing in April 1954, and finished in June, but his script was 293 pages: much too long for a feature film. Laughton made significant rewrites to the script, and his was the version used for shooting, even though he insisted that Agee be credited as the only writer. Agee's original script ended with a shot of children's faces floating among the stars, an idea that was eventually moved to the opening of the film. Throughout 1954, Gregory worked with the Production Code Administration to change the script to meet the guidelines of the Production Code. There was much concern about depicting a preacher on screen as an evil person, and Gregory made an effort to make the character of the Preacher not appear to be a real, ordained minister. Eventually the script was approved, but Protestant groups who had read the script continued to object to the film's production.\nWhile preparing for the filming, Laughton studied silent films by viewing their original nitrate prints, including \"The Birth of a Nation\", \"Intolerance\", and \"The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse\". He wanted to \"restore the power of silent films to talkies.\"\nThe budget of the film was a little under $600,000, of which about $75,000 was for the rights to adapt the novel.\nCasting.\nLaughton's initial thought after reading the novel was to cast himself in the role of the Preacher, but Gregory convinced him that no studio would finance a film unless they cast someone else. For the most part, he did not hold traditional auditions for the actors; he simply met with them to get a sense of their personalities and whether they were right for the role.\nLaughton considered casting Gary Cooper as Harry Powell, but Cooper declined the role as he thought it might be detrimental to his career. John Carradine expressed interest in the Powell role, as did Laurence Olivier but the latter's schedule was not free for two years. Next, Laughton approached Robert Mitchum: \"'I'm directing this film and there's a character in it who is a diabolical shit.' 'Present,' replied Mitchum.\" Laughton liked Mitchum for the role partly due to his sexual persona, but Grubb was concerned about the character of the Preacher being considered sexual. Laughton told Grubb, \"If you want to sell God, you have to be sexy.\"\nAgnes Moorehead, Grace Kelly, and Betty Grable were all considered for the role of Willa Harper. In the end Laughton chose Shelley Winters because he felt she had a vulnerable quality and was more of a serious actor than a movie star; she committed to the role only two weeks before filming began. In her 1989 memoir, Winters described this as \"probably the most thoughtful and reserved performance I ever gave\".\nLaughton's first pick for the role of Rachel Cooper was his wife Elsa Lanchester. Jane Darwell and Louise Fazenda also were considered. Lanchester, for reasons unknown to Laughton, turned down the role, suggesting silent movie star Lillian Gish for the role. A doubtful Laughton went to New York for the purpose of watching films in which Gish starred. These included the shorts and feature films she made with pioneer D.W. Griffith. Gish had gotten word of his watching these old movies, and when she asked him why, he replied, \"When I first went to the movies, they sat in their seats straight and leaned forward. Now they slump down, with their heads back, and eat candy and popcorn. I want them to sit up straight again.\"\nFilming.\nPrincipal photography of \"The Night of the Hunter\" began on August 15 and ended on October 7, 1954, a total of 36 days of shooting. Laughton kept the editor and musical composer on set during filming, which was very uncommon at the time. Mitchum originally suggested that Laughton shoot the film in authentic Appalachian locations, but there was insufficient budget to do on-location shooting. Besides, Laughton wanted to create the film's unique look on Hollywood sound stages and found what he was looking for at Path\u00e9, Republic Studios, and the Rowland V. Lee ranch in the San Fernando Valley. Certain cutaway shots and compositing shots were filmed in West Virginia. Laughton hired Terry Sanders as second unit director in order to scout and shoot the river scenes because he had recently directed an Academy Award-winning short film \"A Time Out of War\", which mostly took place on a river.\nRather than shooting with traditional takes, Laughton had the crew only slate at the beginning of each reel of film and let the camera roll continuously until the reel ran out. This was so that he could direct the actors without waiting to reset the camera and sound equipment, not unlike the way silent films used to be directed. Shelley Winters told Laughton she had this image of Willa as being \"a fly fascinated by a spider, and she very willingly walks into this web\". He liked this image and told her to channel that into the performance. Indeed, a stylized spider and web are seen as the children make their way along the riverbank at night fleeing Mitchum. Mitchum's performance in the film has been described as Brechtian acting, which Laughton had extensive experience with. According to Lillian Gish, Laughton was very unsure of himself on set as this was his first time directing a film, and when someone would give him a suggestion he would start talking about fears that his whole vision was wrong. Laughton's directing style was supportive and respectful of the actors' input and several of the actors have said it was among their favorite professional experiences.\nThe director of photography was Stanley Cortez, who also shot Orson Welles' 1942 film \"The Magnificent Ambersons\". Because Laughton had very little experience working with film, Cortez would visit his house to explain various concepts of camera lenses, camera heights, and what effect each of them gave. Laughton told Cortez that the nitrate prints of the silent movies that he had been watching for research impressed him with how sharp they looked, so he asked Cortez to create that same sharpness for \"The Night of the Hunter\". The studio brought most of the crew from a recent film \"Black Tuesday\" because they had worked so well together, and Cortez had experimented with a new black-and-white film Kodak Tri-X on that production, with great results. He chose to shoot certain scenes of this film on Tri-X because it had a sharp contrast that would help fulfill Laughton's vision. The studio however, tried to convince them to shoot on color film instead because they thought it would sell more tickets. Gregory fought to keep it black-and-white: \"I could not see this film being in color.\" The style of the cinematography was split up between the two units: the first unit of the crew shot the scenes in and around the Harpers' home, which were very dark, whereas the second unit shot the scenes traveling along the river, which were designed to look more like images from the children's perspective. One scene in particular that Cortez has spoken about is in the bedroom after Willa has overheard Powell threatening the children. He lit this scene with a halo of light surrounding Willa's head on the pillow, foreshadowing that her death is imminent. Cortez also brought back the Iris shot in one scene, as an homage to silent films.\nLaughton drew on the harsh, angular look of German expressionist films of the 1920s, which is especially noticeable in the art direction by Hilyard Brown. He had the idea that children notice only certain details of their surroundings that they are focused on, which is why some set pieces are somewhat abstract and minimal: neon lights that are not attached to a particular store, white picket fences that are not surrounding any house, the barn along the river that looks like a painting, and the \"chapel-like\" parents' bedroom. The river scenes with the children were all shot on a sound stage. The shot of John looking out of the barn window and seeing Powell's silhouette on the horizon was created using a little person and a miniature horse. The underwater scene showing Willa's dead body was shot in a studio using a mannequin with a custom mask to make it look like Winters.\nScore.\nThe film's score, composed and arranged by Walter Schumann in close association with Laughton, features a combination of nostalgic and expressionistic orchestral passages. The film has two original songs by Schumann, \"Lullaby\" (sung by Kitty White, whom Schumann discovered in a nightclub) and \"Pretty Fly\" (originally sung by Sally Jane Bruce as Pearl, but later dubbed by an actress named Betty Benson). A recurring musical device involves the Preacher making his presence known by singing the traditional hymn \"Leaning on the Everlasting Arms\". RCA Victor was impressed by the score, so in 1955 they released a soundtrack with Schumann's score and Laughton narrating an abridged version of the story, also written by Grubb.\nPost production.\nThe film's editor, Robert Golden, has said that after he screened the complete film to one of the United Artists studio executives for the first time, the executive told Golden, \"It's too arty.\"\nRelease.\n\"The Night of the Hunter\" premiered on July 26, 1955, in Des Moines, Iowa, a special event to raise money for the YMCA in Gregory's hometown, which included a parade and a broadcast on \"The Tonight Show\". It later had its premiere in Los Angeles on August 26, 1955, and in New York on September 29, 1955.\nTo promote the film, the \"Los Angeles Herald-Express\" serialized the film's script throughout April 1955. The film also received an extensive promotional campaign from United Artists, but they were not sure about the best way to promote it because it did not fall into any typical film genres, and the promotional material did not give a good sense of what the film was about. However, one of the film's advertisements won an award for being in the top-fifty best advertisements of 1954 from the American Institute of Graphic Arts. According to Paul Gregory, \"absolutely no money was spent on promotion...United Artists didn't have the muscle, desire, or intelligence to handle the picture.\" He originally had the idea to tour the film \"road show style\", stopping at certain cities that were familiar with Laughton's plays, but he could not convince the studio.\nThe Roman Catholic Diocese of Cheyenne denied the film's release, and Gregory wanted to put together a lawsuit against them, but the studio would not allow it.\nReception.\nContemporaneous.\n\"The Night of the Hunter\" was a failure with both audiences and critics at its initial release. Laughton took the failure of his first film personally, and never attempted to make another film.\nBosley Crowther of \"The New York Times\" called the film \"a weird and intriguing endeavor\", adding: \"unfortunately the story and the thesis presented by Mr. Grubb had to be carried through by Mr. Laughton to a finish\u2014and it is here that he goes wrong. For the evolution of the melodrama, after the threatened, frightened children flee home, angles off into that allegorical contrast of the forces of Evil and Good.\" Gene Arneel of \"Variety\" summarized: \"The relentless terror of Davis Grubb's novel got away from Paul Gregory and Charles Laughton in their translation of \"Night of the Hunter\". This start for Gregory as producer and Laughton as director is rich in promise but the completed product, bewitching at times, loses sustained drive via too many offbeat touches that have a misty effect.\" \"Harrison's Reports\" wrote, \"The picture might have some appeal for those who patronize art houses in search of the unusual in movie fare, but the great majority of those who see it will look upon it as a choppily-edited, foggy melodrama peopled with foggy characters.\" \"Life\" summed up the film: \"If sometimes it strains too hard at being simple and winds up being pretentious, it still is one of the year's most interesting and provocative films.\"\nThe Chicago Tribune wrote: \"Insanity, greed, murder and assorted horrors thrown in for the sheer sake of horror make up the unappetizing suspense drama, 'The Night of the Hunter.' Seldom has so much ugliness been put into one movie, some of it dragged in for no apparent reason. The weight of the accumulated brutality breaks down the story's power long before the finish, and an audience is inclined to laugh aloud at lines that are intended to represent spine chilling thrills. A smaller dose of this strong stuff would have made a much more effective movie, but 'The Night of the Hunter' is not only overladed with violence, but overacted, overdirected, and overly laden with clammy atmosphere. It moves slowly and unnaturally thru unrealistic settings to a loose, implausible conclusion. Robert Mitchum...is guilty of extremely heavy handed histrionism. When he seeks to mask his vile motives behind an oily religious jargon and a mouthful of sweet talk, he is so ludicrous you can't blame moviegoers for laughing aloud. Shelly Winters turns in a highly credible job...Lillian Gish does what she can with the somewhat vague role of a woman who makes it a practice to take in homeless children who wander to her door. And speaking of children\u2014keep them away from 'The Night of the Hunter'.\"\nThe Legion of Decency gave the film a B because it degraded marriage, and the Protestant Motion Picture Council rated it \"objectionable\", saying that any religious person would be offended by it. The film was also banned in Memphis, Tennessee, by the city's head of censorship, Lloyd Binford. Great Britain rated the film \"adults only.\"\nRetrospective.\nOver time, \"The Night of the Hunter\" has been reassessed and recognized as a classic. It began as a cult film, with a small group of fans, and regularly played at museums and in revival houses. Its popularity grew as a new generation of children were exposed to the film when it played on television. In the 1970s, as the field of film criticism began to expand, many articles were written about the film.\nRoger Ebert wrote, \"what a compelling, frightening and beautiful film it is! And how well it has survived its period. Many films of the mid-1950s, even the good ones, seem somewhat dated now, but by setting his story in an invented movie world outside conventional realism, Laughton gave it a timelessness... It is one of the most frightening of movies, with one of the most unforgettable of villains, and on both of those scores, it holds up... well after four decades.\" Dave Kehr wrote that \"Charles Laughton's first and only film as a director is an enduring masterpiece\u2014dark, deep, beautiful, aglow... The source of its style and power is mysterious\u2014it is a film without precedent and without any real equals.\"\nFilm critics have noted that the film explores the theme of Christian hypocrisy, highlighting that Laughton was drawn to the script because he was gay and closeted and was critical of religious homophobia and sexual repression.\nOn Rotten Tomatoes, 93% of 88 critics gave the film a positive review, with a weighted average rating of 9.10/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \"Featuring Robert Mitchum's formidable performance as a child-hunting preacher, \"The Night of the Hunter\" is a disturbing look at good and evil.\" Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the a score of 97 out of 100, based on 21 critics, indicating .\nIn 2015, Taste of Cinema ranked the film 21st among the \"30 Great Psychopath Movies That Are Worth Your Time\", and GamesRadar+ named Powell one of the \"50 Creepiest Movie Psychopaths.\nLegacy.\nIn 1992, the United States Library of Congress deemed \"The Night of the Hunter\" to be \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\", and selected the film for preservation in its National Film Registry.

In the 1989 Spike Lee film \"Do the Right Thing\", the character Radio Raheem wears brass knuckles saying \"love\" and \"hate\" on each hand and gives a speech that is an almost verbatim copy of Powell's.\nThe Coen brothers have referenced \"The Night of the Hunter\" in several of their own films, including \"The Big Lebowski\" (\"the Dude abides\", an echo of Rachel's closing line \"They abide, and they endure\") and \"True Grit\" (the visual style of Rooster's night ride with Mattie is similar to that of John and Pearl's river journey, and the score uses the music from \"Leaning on the Everlasting Arms\").\nHome media.\n\"The Night of the Hunter\" was released on DVD by MGM Home Entertainment in 2000.

Young. The film tells the story of Duff Anderson, an African-American railroad worker in the early 1960s who tries to maintain his dignity in a small racist town near Birmingham, Alabama, after he marries the local preacher's daughter. In addition to dealing with oppression and discrimination, Anderson must also come to terms with his troubled relationship with his own father, a drunk who abandoned and rejected him.\nAlthough it was not widely seen upon release due to difficulties in finding distribution, the film is now generally considered to be an important example of neorealistic American cinema. In 1993, it was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".\nPlot.\nDuff Anderson works on a railroad section gang near Birmingham, Alabama, earning a good wage and living an itinerant life with his black co-workers. On their night off, while the other men drink and visit a pool hall, Duff decides to walk into the nearby small town, and ends up at a church meeting featuring good food and lively gospel music. There, Duff meets the pretty and gentle schoolteacher Josie, the daughter of Preacher Dawson. They begin to date against the wishes of Josie's father and stepmother, who think the relatively uneducated, non-religious, and (to them) arrogant Duff is not good enough for Josie. Despite her parents' objections, Josie continues to see Duff, partly because Duff shows himself willing to resist and challenge the social conventions that oppress black people, rather than just accepting the status quo in order to get along with white people, as Josie's father has done.\nInitially, Duff is just looking for a sexual relationship and tells Josie he doesn't want to get married. But after Duff visits his four-year-old illegitimate son in the care of an unloving, indifferent stepmother, and his emotionally abusive, hardly functioning drunken father (Harris) living off his girlfriend (Lee), Duff realizes that he prefers the stability of a family to the life of a drifter. Duff and Josie marry with bright hopes for the future but then begin to face a series of challenges as a married couple.\nDuff quits the section gang and takes a lower paying job at the local sawmill in order to have a stable home life. Being on the move had given Duff the illusion of freedom, but living in the town makes Duff subject to the town's social rules, and he immediately starts to have problems. Unlike his peers, Duff refuses to pretend to be friendly to white people who treat him obnoxiously or patronize him. Duff tries to encourage his black co-workers at the mill to stick together and stand up for their rights, but one of them informs on him to the white mill bosses, who suspect him of being a union organizer and troublemaker. After Duff refuses to follow his white boss's order to retract his statements to the other men, Duff is fired, and subsequently finds himself blacklisted at other area mills. Despite diligently searching for work, he is unable to find another job that is not humiliating and that also pays enough to support his family, now including a baby on the way.\nDuff hates his preacher father-in-law, whom he sees as having sold out to the white people in return for social status and economic gain, and he hurtfully says to his wife, \"You've never really been a nigger, living with them, in that house.\" Nevertheless, out of concern for Josie, Preacher Dawson uses his connections in the town to get Duff a job at a white-owned gas station. Soon, white customers who find Duff too proud for a black \"boy\" threaten to cause trouble if the boss keeps him on, and he loses that job as well. Although Josie is understanding, Duff, under emotional pressure and in a rage, shoves his pregnant wife to the floor when she tries to comfort him. Duff packs his bag and leaves their house, telling Josie that he will write her when he is on his feet again.\nDuff storms off to his father, and finds him so inebriated that he dies as Duff and Lee are driving him to the hospital. Neither Duff nor Lee know where Duff's father was born or how old he was, and the only possessions he has handed down to Duff are the contents of his pockets. Duff decides to return home with his young son, whom Josie had been wanting to adopt. Duff and Josie tearfully embrace as he reassures her that it \"ain't gonna be easy, baby, but it's going to be alright. Baby, I feel so free inside\u201d.\nProduction.\nThe screenplay was written by Robert M. Young and Michael Roemer, who drew on his own background as a Jew persecuted by Nazis. Roemer had fled Nazi Germany as an 11-year-old child on the Kindertransports. Before starting to write, Roemer and Young went on a quest to understand and get to know the African-American culture of the South. They \u201cleft on an Underground Railway in reverse\u201d. As liberal Jews in the South, they were treated by whites as pariahs and warned that their food might be poisoned, causing them to relate strongly to the black families whom they met. They allowed themselves to be passed on from one family and community to the next so they could learn as much as possible about the relationships and experiences. One morning in Mississippi, the plot of a young couple's struggles and the man's relationship with his father came to Roemer, and the script was written in six weeks as soon as they were back in New York City.\nAlthough the script was written quickly, casting took several months. Charles Gordone was responsible for introducing the writers to some of the main talent, including Broadway actor Ivan Dixon, who went on to play the role of Staff Sergeant James Kinchloe on the CBS-TV sitcom \"Hogan's Heroes\", and jazz great Abbey Lincoln. Julius Harris made his acting debut in the film playing Duff's father. Harris was a nurse before he was cast, but had always wanted to act. Yaphet Kotto also had his first credited movie role in the film, playing a railroad worker. Both Harris and Kotto went on to appear in many more films and television programs over the next four decades.\nAt the last minute, the film's title was almost changed to \"Duff Anderson\".\nReception.\n\"Nothing but a Man\" premiered at Philharmonic Hall and had a limited run in a few cities, receiving rave reviews at the New York Film Festival and winning a coveted prize at the Venice Film Festival. However, according to Roger Ebert, the film's release was \"spotty\" and little money was available for its promotion. The film was mostly shown at theaters specializing in independent and foreign films. Ebert has suggested that it failed to find a wider audience because it did not \"[employ] the easy liberal pieties of its period in an attempt to reassure white audiences that all stories have happy endings.\"\nAs a result, the film became, in Ebert's words, \"more famous than familiar\" and as of the early 1990s, few people had seen it. In 1993, a restored print of the film was nationally re-released, bringing it to the attention of a wider audience. It was later released on DVD in 2004.\nThe film has received many excellent reviews and as of 2022, had a 98% fresh rating on the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes from 44 critics. A \"Washington Post\" review at the time of the film's 1993 re-release called it \"one of the most sensitive films about black life ever made in this country\". Ivan Dixon's performance in the film has been called the best of his career.\nHonors and awards.\nIn 1964, \"Nothing but a Man\" won the San Giorgio Prize at the Venice Film Festival, awarded to films considered especially important for the progress of civilization. The film was added to the National Film Registry of the Library of Congress in 1993.\nSoundtrack.\nThe soundtrack to the film was put together by Wilbur Kirk. It uses many early 1960s hit songs released by Motown Records; it was the label's first original soundtrack recording. Motown released an original soundtrack album for the film on CD in 1996.\nTrack Listing\nNovelization.\nA novelization of the film by noted pulp crime writer Jim Thompson was published in 1970 by Popular Library.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The film was adapted by Geoffrey Homes (Daniel Mainwaring) from his 1946 novel \"Build My Gallows High\" (also written as Homes), with uncredited revisions by Frank Fenton and James M. Cain.\nIts complex, fatalistic storyline, dark cinematography, and classic \"femme fatale\" garnered the film critical acclaim and cult status. In 1991, the National Film Preservation Board at the Library of Congress added \"Out of the Past\" to the United States National Film Registry of \u201cculturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\u201d films.\nPlot.\nJoe Stefanos arrives in Bridgeport, California, a rural mountain town, seeking Jeff Bailey, who owns a local gas station. Joe meets The Kid, Jeff's deaf-mute employee and friend, and asks him about Jeff's whereabouts. Meanwhile, Jeff is fishing with Ann Miller. They are in love, though her lifelong friend Jim is jealous. The Kid shows up at the fishing spot and interrupts them, signing to Jeff that someone is asking about him. Jeff returns to the gas station and Stefanos tells Jeff that he must go to Lake Tahoe to meet \"Whit\" and that it has been a long time since they met. Jeff invites Ann to ride with him to Whit's place. He tells her about his past in a flashback that took place three years ago.\nJeff Bailey's real name is Jeff Markham. He and Jack Fisher were partners and private investigators in New York City. Whit Sterling, a gambling kingpin, hires Markham\u2014solo\u2014to find Whit's girlfriend, Kathie Moffat, who shot Whit and stole $40,000 from him. Whit promises Jeff she will not be harmed if he finds her and has her returned to him. Jeff eventually corners Kathie in Acapulco and is immediately taken by her beauty. Kathie admits she shot Whit and that she hates him but denies taking his money. Eventually, Jeff falls in love with her and proposes that they run away together. Suddenly, Whit and Stefanos show up at Jeff's place in Acapulco. They ask Jeff if he managed to find Kathie, but he lies to them and says that she is on a south-bound steamer. Whit instructs Jeff to keep looking for her.\nJeff and Kathie secretly run to San Francisco. They initially avoid appearing in public spaces but then feel more comfortable to go out as time moves on. However, Fisher, who is now working for Whit, spots Jeff at the track. Jeff arranges to meet Kathie to split and then meet at a mountain cabin to lose Fisher from trailing him, but Fisher chooses to follow Kathie instead and catches them at the cabin. Fisher tries to blackmail the couple and the two men brawl. Kathie deliberately kills Fisher and drives away, leaving behind a bank book showing a balance of $40,000\u2013she had in fact taken Whit's money.\nThe flashback ends. Jeff wants to clean things up and return to Ann. Ann drops him off at Whit's estate. A cheerful Whit tells Jeff he has a job for him. To his surprise, Jeff finds out that Kathie went back to Whit and she appears as the two men have breakfast. Kathie later comes to speak privately with Jeff, telling him that she had no choice but to come back. She told Whit about their relationship but not about what happened to Fisher. Jeff tells her to get out.\nLeonard Eels, a crooked San Francisco lawyer, helped Whit dodge $1 million in taxes and is now blackmailing him. Whit wants Jeff to recover the incriminating records and tells him to meet with Eels' secretary. The secretary, Meta Carson, explains the plan to Jeff, who suspects he is being framed. That night, at Eels' apartment, Jeff alerts Eels, obliquely, promising to return. After Jeff and Meta leave Eels' apartment, Jeff trails Meta, then returns and finds Eels dead. He hides the body in the closet of a neighboring apartment.\nJeff sneaks into Meta's apartment and overhears Kathie arranging for the discovery of Eels's body. When the hidden body is not found, she believes Eels has escaped. Jeff confronts her, and Kathie reveals that she gave Whit a signed affidavit swearing that Jeff had killed Fisher. She says they can start all over again. They kiss, and he leaves. Stefanos arrives and confirms to Kathie that he killed Eels. Jeff consigns the tax papers to a delivery service, but Whit's thugs capture him. He offers the incriminating records in exchange for the affidavit, without implicating Kathie. When Kathie and Meta arrive at Eels' apartment to retrieve the affidavit, the police are already there. The women instead phone Whit.\nJeff becomes wanted for the murders of Fisher and Eels, and police expect him to return to Bridgeport. Stefanos, directed by Kathie, trails The Kid to the gorge where Jeff is hiding out. The Kid spots Stefanos poised to shoot Jeff and hooks his coat with a fishing line, pulling him off-balance so that he falls to his death. Jeff returns to Whit's mansion to inform them of Stefanos' death and to tell Whit about Kathie's double-cross. He suggests making Stefanos' death look like a guilt-ridden suicide after his murder of Eels. He will return the records if Whit destroys Kathie's affidavit and hands her over to the police for Fisher's death. Whit accepts, promising Kathie he will kill her if she does not cooperate.\nJeff meets Ann in the woods. Ann believes in Jeff but tells him to be absolutely sure of what he wants; she promises to wait for him. Jeff discovers that Kathie has killed Whit. She gives Jeff a choice: run away with her or take the blame for all three murders. Jeff dials the phone while she is upstairs packing. They leave in a car with Jeff driving. Seeing a police roadblock ahead, Kathie shoots Jeff. She fires at the police. A machine gun riddles the car with bullets, killing her.\nIn Bridgeport, Ann asks The Kid if Jeff was going away with Kathie. Lying, The Kid nods his head. Ann gets into Jim's car, and The Kid smiles, saluting Jeff's name on the gas station's sign.\nBackground and production.\nDaniel Mainwaring wrote \"Build My Gallows High\" while on retreat after writing six movies in one year. He was also slightly burned out on detective fiction, having written several novels featuring a sleuthing reporter named Robin Bishop. He read a poem by an African-American writer that provided the title for the novel. \nOne scholar deduced that the poem in question is \"Haman\" from Benjamin Cutler Clark's \"The Past, Present, and Future\" (1867). The poem is about Haman's machinations and includes the line, \"At length a gallows high he swung, upon which all were to be hung...\"\nA script reader at RKO Pictures recommended the novel as a \"worthy addition to the rough, tough school of Chandler, Cain and Burnett...presents an almost perfect story for an actor like Bogart\". William Dozier approved the purchase for $20,000, which included Mainwaring as screenwriter. Gallup's Audience Research recommended RKO change the title to \"Out of the Past\". Warren Duff was unsure about Mainwaring's first draft. One of the problems was The Kid narrated the film, which convoluted the structure. Duff paid James M. Cain $20,000 to re-write it, but the second draft was so flawed Duff hired Mainwaring back to finish the screenplay.\n\"Out of the Past\" was produced by RKO Pictures, and the key personnel\u2014director Jacques Tourneur, cinematographer Nicholas Musuraca, actors Mitchum and Greer, along with Albert S. D'Agostino's design group\u2014were long-time RKO collaborators. Although the studio focused on making B-films during the early 1940s, the post\u2013World War II \"Out of the Past\" was given a comparatively lavish budget.\nJohn Garfield and Dick Powell turned down the lead. Kirk Douglas, in only his third credited screen performance, plays a supporting role but a central part in the story as Mitchum's antagonist. The next time Mitchum and Douglas played major roles in the same picture was in the 1967 Western \"The Way West\", alongside Richard Widmark.\nMusuraca also shot Tourneur's 1942 RKO horror film \"Cat People\".\nReception and legacy.\nThe film made a profit of $90,000.\n\"Out of the Past\" is considered one of the greatest of all films noir. Robert Ottoson hailed the film as \"the \"ne plus ultra\" of forties film noir\". Bosley Crowther, the film critic for \"The New York Times\" in 1947, complimented the crime drama's direction and performances, although he did find the latter portion of the screenplay hard to follow:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;...it's very snappy and quite intriguingly played by a cast that has been well and smartly directed by Jacques Tourneur. Robert Mitchum is magnificently cheeky and self-assured as the tangled 'private eye,' consuming an astronomical number of cigarettes in displaying his nonchalance. And Jane Greer is very sleek as his Delilah, Kirk Douglas is crisp as a big crook and Richard Webb, Virginia Huston, Rhonda Fleming and Dickie Moore are picturesque in other roles. If only we had some way of knowing what's going on in the last half of this film, we might get more pleasure from it. As it is, the challenge is worth a try.\nShortly after the film's release, the staff of the widely read trade publication \"Variety\" also gave it a positive review:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"Out of the Past\" is a hardboiled melodrama [from the novel by Geoffrey Homes] strong on characterization. Direction by Jacques Tourneur pays close attention to mood development, achieving realistic flavor that is further emphasized by real life settings and topnotch lensing by Nicholas Musuraca...Mitchum gives a very strong account of himself. Jane Greer as the baby-faced, charming killer is another lending potent interest. Kirk Douglas, the gangster, is believable and Paul Valentine makes his role of henchman stand out. Rhonda Fleming is in briefly but effectively.\"\nIn \"The Nation\" in 1948, James Agee wrote, \"\"Out of the Past\" is a medium-grade thriller... Fairly well played, and very well photographed... the action develops a routine kind of pseudo-tension... Robert Mitchum is so very sleepily self-confident with the women that when he slopes into clinches you expect him to snore in their faces.\"\nDecades later, in his 2004 assessment of the film for the \"Chicago Sun-Times\", critic Roger Ebert noted:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"Out of the Past\" is one of the greatest of all film noirs, the story of a man who tries to break with his past and his weakness and start over again in a town, with a new job and a new girl. The film stars Robert Mitchum, whose weary eyes and laconic voice, whose very presence as a violent man wrapped in indifference, made him an archetypal noir actor. The story opens before we've even seen him, as trouble comes to town looking for him. A man from his past has seen him pumping gas, and now his old life reaches out and pulls him back.\nWith regard to the production's stylish and moody cinematography, Ebert also dubbed the film \"The greatest cigarette-smoking movie of all time\":\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;...The trick, as demonstrated by Jacques Tourneur and his cameraman, Nicholas Musuraca, is to throw a lot of light into the empty space where the characters are going to exhale. When they do, they produce great white clouds of smoke, which express their moods, their personalities and their energy levels. There were guns in \"Out of the Past,\" but the real hostility came when Robert Mitchum and Kirk Douglas smoked at each other.\nPauline Kael wrote, \"A thin but well-shot suspense melodrama... It's empty trash, but you do keep watching it.\" Leslie Halliwell gave it two of four stars, stating: \"Moody \"film noir\" with Hollywood imitating French models; plenty of snarling and a death-strewn climax.\" Eddie Muller lauded the film: \"Mainwaring's serpentine story is all about mood and movement, dreamily winding its way through various locations, shifting rhythms, seducing the audience toward the black hole at its heart. It nailed the bull's-eye and its reverberations linger after repeated viewings: guilt, duplicity, self-deception, and the lonely hero's need to push it to the bitter end, tempting fate once too often.\"\nThe film holds a score of 93% on review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes, with an average rating of 9/10, based on 40 reviews. Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the a score of 85 out of 100, based on 40 critics, indicating .\nAdaptations.\n\"Out of the Past\" was remade as \"Against All Odds\" (1984) with Rachel Ward in the Greer role, Jeff Bridges filling in for Mitchum, and James Woods as a variation of Kirk Douglas' villain, with Jane Greer as the mother of her original character in \"Out of the Past\" and Richard Widmark in a supporting role.\nOn November 14, 1987, Mitchum guest hosted \"Saturday Night Live\". Greer made a surprise appearance in a gag sequel called \"Out of Gas,\" in which their characters met again 40 years later at a filling station.\nHas been shown on the Turner Classic Movies show \"Noir Alley\" with Eddie Muller.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The park is roughly long, following the course of the Genesee River as it flows north through a deep gorge and over several large waterfalls. It is located southwest of Rochester and southeast of Buffalo, and spans portions of the Livingston County towns of Leicester, Mount Morris and Portage, as well as the Wyoming County towns of Castile and Genesee Falls.\nIn 1859, Buffalo industrialist William Pryor Letchworth (1823\u20131910) began purchasing land near the Middle Falls, and started construction of his Glen Iris Estate. In 1906 he bequeathed the estate to New York, which soon after became the core of the newly created Letchworth State Park. The park prominently features three large waterfalls\u00a0\u2013 the Upper, Middle, and Lower Falls\u00a0\u2013 on the Genesee River, which flows within a deep gorge that winds through the park. The rock walls of the gorge, which rise up to in places, prompted the area's reputation as the \"Grand Canyon of the East\".\nFeatures and activities.\nPark entrances are located near Mount Morris, Perry, Castile and Portageville. A paved two or three-lane road follows the west side of the gorge, allowing many scenic viewpoints for the geologic features.\nThe park includes pavilions, picnic tables, playgrounds, of hiking trails, two large swimming pools, cabins, campsites for tents, trailer sites with dumping stations, and horse-riding trails. Activities within the park include hiking, biking, fishing, whitewater rafting and kayaking, geocaching, and hunting (wild turkey and deer when in season). During the winter, the park facilitates snowmobiling, cross-country skiing, snow tubing, and horse-drawn sleighs. Hot air ballooning is available at the park, weather permitting.\nIn 2015, Letchworth State Park won \"USA Today\"'s Reader's Choice competition as the best state park in the United States. In 2020 the park topped a similar list.\nWaterfalls and geology.\nWithin the park, there are three large waterfalls on the Genesee River and as many as 50 waterfalls found on tributaries that flow into it; the deep gorge formed by the river, with rock walls rising up to in places and which narrow to across above the middle of the three falls, prompted the area's reputation as the \"Grand Canyon of the East\". The three major waterfalls \u2014 called the Upper, Middle, and Lower Falls \u2014 are located in Portage Canyon, the southern section of the park. The only trail bridging the Genesee River in the park crosses a stone bridge just below the Lower Falls. The Middle Falls is the highest, and the Upper Falls has a recently built (2017) active Norfolk Southern Railway arch bridge crossing immediately above it, replacing a historic 1875 Erie Railroad bridge.\nThe park also contains Inspiration Falls, a ribbon waterfall that is located on a tributary creek a short distance east of the Inspiration Point Overlook, west of the park visitor center. It has a total drop of . While impressive in its height, it is seasonal and often appears as only a water stain on the cliff. The falls faces to the south-southwest and has a crest that is wide.\nThe bedrock exposed in the gorge is Devonian in age, mostly shales, with some layers of limestone and sandstone. The rock was laid down in an ancient inland sea, and it holds many marine fossils. The landform of the section of the Genesee River valley represented by the park is geologically very young, caused by a diversion of the river from the old valley by the last continental glacier, which forced the river to cut a new section of valley.\nHistoric sites and museums.\nThe historic, restored Glen Iris Inn, William Pryor Letchworth's former residence adapted for use as a hotel, is located on the top of a cliff overlooking Middle Falls and offers in-season meals and overnight accommodations. It is open to the public for breakfast, lunch and dinner.\nThe park is the present-day site of the grave of Mary Jemison, a Scots-Irish immigrant pioneer who was captured at the age of 12 from central Pennsylvania by a French and Shawnee raiding party during the French and Indian War. She was soon adopted by a family of Seneca people, and eventually lived in western New York on the Genesee River. She became thoroughly assimilated and chose to live with the Seneca for the rest of her long life, having a total of seven children by two successive husbands. Her remains were exhumed from the Buffalo Creek Reservation and reinterred on the grounds of a Seneca Council House, relocated to the site by Letchworth and rededicated in 1872.\nThe park also features the William Pryor Letchworth Museum, which was founded with the collections of the park's founder. The exhibits focus on the natural and cultural history of the Genesee Valley, and include archaeological artifacts of the Seneca nation, and displays on Mary Jemison, early pioneers, the Genesee Valley Canal and William Pryor Letchworth.\nThe Humphrey Nature Center opened in 2016. Operated year-round by New York State, the sustainable building features classrooms and meeting rooms, a research lab, a butterfly garden, and connections to various trails.\nMount Morris Dam.\nConstruction of the Mount Morris Dam, at the north end of the park, was begun in 1948 by the United States Army Corps of Engineers under the Flood Control Act of 1944, and completed in 1954. The Genesee River became wider and deeper immediately upstream as a result, but areas downstream were spared yearly flooding which destroyed valuable farmland.\nThe Mount Morris Dam is the largest flood control device of its kind (concrete gravity) east of the Mississippi River. It is in length and rises from the riverbed. The dam proved its worth during the Flood of 1972, saving thousands of acres of farmland and the city of Rochester from flooding.\nPortage Viaduct.\nThe Portage Viaduct (1875) was an iron Erie Railroad bridge located upstream and within view of the park's Upper Falls. The bridge was long and high. Although walking on the structure was considered trespassing, visitors to the park commonly disregarded warning signs in order to view the gorge from the bridge, despite the safety concerns associated with walking on an active railroad bridge.\nOn November 29, 2011, Norfolk Southern Railway announced plans to demolish the Portage Viaduct and build a new bridge approximately to the south of the 1875 structure. Norfolk Southern had offered the old bridge to the State of New York, but the offer was declined due to a lack of available funds to convert the bridge into an observation platform. A steel arch design was approved for the bridge's replacement in late 2014, at an estimated cost of $71 million. The project was completed in late 2017. New train-activated gates at both ends of the new bridge now keep trespassing tourists off it when no approaching freight train is present.\nPark history.\nThe territory of the park was long part of the homeland of the Seneca people, who were largely forced out after the American Revolutionary War, as they had been allies of the defeated British. The Seneca called the land around this canyon \"Sehgahunda\", the \"Vale of the three falls\"; the Middle Falls (\"Ska-ga-dee\") was believed to be so wondrous it made the sun stop at midday.\nHaving first viewed the gorge that was to become the park from a train on the nearby railroad trestle in 1858, William Pryor Letchworth purchased an initial of land near the Portage Falls in 1859 and subsequently began work on his Glen Iris Estate. By purchasing the land, Letchworth successfully halted plans to install a hydroelectric dam in the gorge that would have altered the flow of the river and diminished flows over the large waterfalls. He enlisted the services of the famous landscape artist William Webster to design winding paths and roadways, rustic bridges, glistening \"lakes\" and a sparkling fountain.\nLetchworth spent the following years expanding his landholdings in the area. In 1906, Letchworth granted the Glen Iris and the surrounding to the State of New York as a public park, intending to deter commercial businesses from damaging the fragile nature of the gorge and surrounding woodlands. He further required that the land be managed by the American Scenic and Historic Preservation Society. A plaque near the gorge contains a dedication written by Letchworth's niece in 1910, and reads:\nGeorge F. Kunz, president of the American Scenic and Historic Preservation Society of New York, was an enthusiastic supporter of the park. Dr. Kunz helped with the organization and preservation of the library of William Pryor Letchworth when the society took over the management of his estate in New York. In 1907, it was stated: \"The library embraces one of the finest, if not the finest, private collection of books on charities in the country. It contains also a good collection of local histories, books about Indians, and a miscellaneous assortment of standard literature. His mementos - personal gifts and testimonials - are extremely interesting. It is most desirable that these should be kept together and adequately-preserved in a new library building, as part of the monument to the generous donor of Letchworth Park.\"\nFurther, Dr. Kunz helped with the 1910 memorial to Mary Jemison, \"The White Indian of the Genesee\", who is buried at \"the ancient Indian Council House of the Senecas\" located on the grounds of the Letchworth park.\nLetchworth, having earned \"life-residence\" at the Glen Iris, died there on December 1, 1910. He was buried in Buffalo at Forest Lawn Cemetery.\nThe park was the beneficiary of numerous enhancements enacted by workers from the Civilian Conservation Corps, who inhabited a large camp at the park during the 1930s. Improvements enacted by the CCC included the construction of cabins, overlooks, bridges and trails.\nOld Portageville Bridge Fire.\nThe Erie Railroad Company built a wooden trestle bridge over the Genesee River just above the Upper Falls. Construction started on July 1, 1851, and the bridge opened on August 16, 1852. At the time, it was the longest and tallest wooden bridge in the world.\nIn the early morning hours of Thursday, May 6, 1875, the great wooden railroad bridge was destroyed in a tremendous fire. The bridge was a total loss, leaving only the concrete bridge abutments.\nImmediately after the Portage Bridge fire, officials of the Erie Railroad Company moved quickly to replace the wooden bridge with an iron design. Construction began on June 8, 1875, and the Portage Viaduct opened for traffic on July 31, 1875: an incredible construction feat for that or any other time.\nFlood of 1972.\nOne of the greatest natural disasters in Genesee Valley history took place in June 1972. Hurricane Agnes came ashore on the Florida Panhandle on June 19, 1972, and moved north through Georgia and South Carolina. The hurricane then went out to sea via North Carolina, recharged its energy and hit the Southern Tier of New York State on June 22, 1972.\nAlthough Agnes was only a Category 1 hurricane, it soon stalled over North Central Pennsylvania. Caught up in a slow moving low pressure system, the storm drifted slowly northeastward into New York State. The area, having already been soaked by showers the week before, could not absorb the rainfall that fell over Pennsylvania and New York. Known locally as the Flood of '72, the event had a tremendous impact on Western New York and Letchworth Park.\nAlthough the Genesee River and Letchworth Park was not hit as hard as the Susquehanna Valley and other areas, the impact of the flood was felt in the park for many years. The Lower Falls Bridge and trail to Sugar Loaf did not officially reopen for several years. Visitors can still see some of the natural scars left by the flood waters more than 50 years ago.\nVideo footage of the devastation can be viewed upon request at the William Pryor Letchworth Museum, located near the Glen Iris Inn.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Wellman, starring Henry Fonda, Dana Andrews and Mary Beth Hughes, with Anthony Quinn, William Eythe, Harry Morgan and Jane Darwell. Two cowboys arrive in a Western town, when news arrives that a local rancher has been murdered and his cattle stolen. The townspeople, joined by the two cowboys and cowboys from other ranches, form a posse to catch the perpetrators. They find three men in possession of the cattle, and are determined to see justice done on the spot.\nThe film premiered in May 1943 to positive reviews from critics. It is one of a select group of films to secure its only Oscar nomination in the Best Picture category -- it received no other nominations in any other Oscar category. This particular circumstance happened 16 times between 1927 and 1943, but as of 2025, the Ox-Bow Incident is the last film whose sole Oscar nomination was in the Best Picture category.A\n\"The Ox-Bow Incident\" and \"The Outlaw\" (also produced in 1943) are the earliest films in the AllMovie list of psychological Westerns.\nIn 1998, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\". The film was adapted from the 1940 novel of the same name, written by Nevadan Walter Van Tilburg Clark.\nPlot.\nIn Bridger's Wells, Nevada, in 1885, two cowboys, Art Croft and Gil Carter, hitch up their horses and enter Darby's Saloon. There, it is learned that a rancher, Larry Kinkaid, has been murdered. The townspeople immediately form a large posse to pursue the murderers. Art and Gil join. Davies, fearing a lynching, also joins, hoping he can prevent such an occurrence. Major Tetley, dressed in an old Civil War uniform, assumes leadership. His son, Gerald, comes with him. Soon, news arrives that three men with cattle bearing Kinkaid's brand have just entered Bridger's Pass.\nLater that night in Ox-Bow Canyon, the posse find three men sleeping, with what are presumed to be stolen cattle nearby. The posse interrogate them: a young, well-spoken man, Donald Martin; a Mexican, Juan Mart\u00ednez; and an old man, Alva Hardwicke, who is clearly senile. Martin claims that he purchased the cattle from Kinkaid but received no bill of sale. No one believes Martin, and the posse decide to hang the three men at sunrise. As a final request, Martin writes a letter to his wife and asks Davies to deliver it. When dissent develops among some members of the group, a vote is taken on whether to hang the trio or take them to town to stand trial. Only seven vote for a trial, including Major Tetley's son, Gerald. The rest support a hanging.\nAfter the lynching, the posse returns to Bridger's Wells. On the way, they encounter the town's sheriff, Risley, who reveals Kinkaid is not dead and that the men who shot him have been arrested. Risley then asks Davies who is responsible for the lynching. \u201cAll but seven,\u201d Davies replies, and the sheriff angrily declares, \u201cGod better have mercy on you. You won't get any from me.\u201d Later, the posse gather in Darby's Saloon. In silence, they listen as Gil quietly reads Martin's letter aloud to Art. Meanwhile, Major Tetley returns to his house, locks his son out after calling him a coward, and commits suicide. In the end, Gil and Art head out of town to deliver the letter and $500 raised by those in the posse for Martin's wife.\nCast.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;* Henry Fonda as Gil Carter \nProduction.\nDirector William A. Wellman loved the novel and wanted to adapt it into a film and then interested Darryl F. Zanuck in producing it. Zanuck agreed in producing the story, on the condition that Wellman would also direct two other films for the studio, \"Thunder Birds\" (1942) and \"Buffalo Bill\" (1944).\nThere are several differences between the film and the novel, notably the fate of the Tetleys and the fate of the lynch mob. In the book, young Gerald commits suicide by hanging himself in the barn. This leads his father to fall on his cavalry sword. The sheriff stares down each member of the mob, but then he says he will forget everything.\nThe role of Gil Carter, played by Henry Fonda, was originally offered to Gary Cooper, who turned it down. Fonda was generally unhappy with the quality of the films he was cast in while under contract with 20th Century Fox. This was one of only two films from that period that he was enthusiastic about acting in (the other was \"The Grapes of Wrath\", made in 1940). Fonda regarded this film as one of his favorites.\nFilming was done from late June to early August 1942, mostly in studio back-lots and sound stages; a limited amount of location shooting was done at a ranch in Chatsworth and in Lone Pine, both in California. Additional sequences and retakes were done mid-August to late August. \nThe production on the film would be shut down for a week or ten days \"due to the $5,000-per-film limit on new construction materials\" imposed by the War Production Board. During the shutdown, already used sets were torn down so their materials could be used to build the mountain pass set. Studio publicity noted that the Ox-Bow Valley setting was \"the largest set ever constructed\" by Fox, covering .\nThe western street set seen in this film was subsequently used in another western, \"The Gunfighter\" (1950), which starred Gregory Peck.\nAfter the film was completed, it was kept on the shelf for months because Fox executives were uncertain how to market a film with such a sobering theme.\nReception.\nThe film received mostly positive reviews. Bosley Crowther of \"The New York Times\" wrote that it \"is not a picture which will brighten or cheer your day. But it is one which, for sheer, stark drama, is currently hard to beat.\" \"Variety\" called it a \"powerful preachment against mob lynching ... Director William Wellman has skillfully guided the characters and driven home the point that hanging is unwarranted. Fonda measures up to star rating ... He helps hold together the loose ends of the rather patent plot.\" David Lardner of \"The New Yorker\" called it a \"rather good piece of work\". \"Harrison's Reports\" printed a negative review, calling it a \"depressing, unpleasant, at times horrible, melodrama ... Whoever is responsible for selecting such sordid material for the screen should be awarded a 'booby' prize.\" In \"The Nation\" in 1943, critic James Agee wrote, \"\"Ox-Bow\" is one of the best and most interesting pictures I have seen for a long time, and it disappointed me... It seems to me that in \"Ox-Bow\" artifice and nature got jammed in such a way as to give a sort of double focus... Here was a remarkably controlled and intelligent film; and in steady nimbus, on every detail, was the stiff over-consciousness of those who made it of the excellence of each effect, to such a degree that the whole thing seemed a mosaic of over-appreciated effects which continually robbed nature of its own warmth and energy, and the makers of the ambitious claims which they had made on nature.\"\nIn his 1957 book, \"Novels into Film: The Metamorphosis of Fiction into Cinema\", George Bluestone cited the film as one of Hollywood's most perfect examples of adapting a great novel, concluding that \"William Wellman and LamarTrotti were able to accomplish cinematically what Walter Van Tilburg Clark accomplished in language.\" More recently, \"La Furia Umana\"'s Toshi Fujiwara said the film is \"one of the most important westerns in the history of American cinema\".\nClint Eastwood has stated this is his favorite film.\nHowever, Darryl F. Zanuck, head of Twentieth Century-Fox 1935\u20131956, recalled the film as \"a flop. In spite of its significance and its dramatic value, our records showed that it had failed to pay its way. In fact, its pulling power was less than that of a Laurel and Hardy comedy we made about the same time.\"\nIt earned $750,000 in the United States.\nAwards and honors.\nThe film was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture at the 16th Academy Awards, losing to \"Casablanca\". As of 2025, it is the last film to have been nominated for Best Picture and nothing else. In 2019, \"Vulture\" included it on a list of \"The Best Movies That Lost Best Picture at the Oscars\".\nAn outdoor mural at Twentieth Century Fox Studios, Century City, depicts the filming of \"The Ox-Bow Incident\".\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nA.&lt;templatestyles src=\"Citation/styles.css\"/&gt;^ The only film to win Best Picture, and be nominated in no other Oscar category, was \"Grand Hotel\" (1932).

{"id": "75270", "revid": "39707640", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=75270", "title": "The Outlaw Josey Wales", "text": "1976 film by Clint Eastwood\nThe Outlaw Josey Wales is a 1976 American revisionist Western film set during and after the American Civil War. It was directed by and starred Clint Eastwood (as Josey Wales), with Chief Dan George, Sondra Locke, Bill McKinney, and John Vernon. During the Civil War, Josey Wales is a Missouri farmer turned soldier, who seeks to avenge the death of his family and gains a reputation as a feared gunfighter. At the end of the war, his group surrenders, but is massacred, and Wales becomes an outlaw, pursued by bounty hunters and soldiers.\nThe film was adapted by Sonia Chernus and Philip Kaufman from author Asa Earl \"Forrest\" Carter's 1972 novel \"\" (republished, as shown in the movie's opening credits, as \"Gone to Texas\"). The film was a commercial success, earning $31.8 million against a $3.7 million budget. In 1996, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".\nJosey Wales was portrayed by Michael Parks in the film's 1986 sequel, \"The Return of Josey Wales\". His wife Laura Lee was played by Mary Ann Averett in the sequel.\nPlot.\nDuring the American Civil War, the wife and son of Missouri farmer Josey Wales are murdered by pro-Union paramilitaries led by the brutal Captain Terrill. After burying their corpses, Wales seeks vengeance for his family by joining a group of Confederate bushwhackers under the command of William T. Anderson, attacking the Union Army and pro-Union sympathizers. After the war ends in 1865, Wales's superior, Captain Fletcher, persuades his men to surrender, having been promised amnesty by Union Senator Jim Lane. However, Terrill's men massacre the bushwhackers after they surrender, with Wales, Fletcher, and fellow bushwhacker Jamie being the only survivors. Wales and Jamie flee, and Lane forces Fletcher to assist Terrill in hunting them down. A mortally wounded Jamie helps Wales kill two bounty hunters before dying.\nWith a $5,000 bounty on his head, Wales flees to Texas. On the way he meets elderly Cherokee man Lone Watie, who informs Wales that Confederate General Joseph O. Shelby is fleeing to Mexico and suggests they do likewise. Wales subsequently rescues young Navajo woman Little Moonlight and kills two other bounty hunters. Alongside Little Moonlight, Wales also rescues an elderly Kansan woman Sarah Turner and her granddaughter Laura Lee from marauding Comancheros. At the town of Santo Rio, two employees of Turner's dead son Tom, Travis Cobb and Chato, also join the group. Wales and his companions find Tom's abandoned ranch and settle down there. Discovering that Travis and Chato have been kidnapped by Comanche chief Ten Bears, Wales rides into his camp and negotiates the return of the two men; an impressed Ten Bears becomes blood brothers with Wales.\nA bounty hunter whose partner was killed by Wales at Santo Rio guides Terrill and his men to the town. On the following morning, Terrill's men launch a surprise attack on the ranch, but Wales's companions manage to gun them all down. Wounded and out of ammunition, Wales follows the fleeing Terrill back to Santo Rio, where he corners him. A wounded Terrill attempts to draw his sabre, but Wales grabs his hand and forces the blade through Terrill's chest, killing him. Returning to the town saloon, Wales discovers its patrons telling Fletcher, accompanied by two Texas Rangers, that an outlaw named Josey Wales was recently killed in Monterrey by five gunmen. The Rangers accept the story and leave, while Fletcher pretends not to recognize Wales, and tells him he will go to Mexico himself to look for Wales and tell him the war is over. Wales responds by stating, \"I reckon so. I guess we all died a little in that damned war.\" He then rides off into the sunset.\nCast.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;* Clint Eastwood as Josey Wales\nProduction.\n\"The Outlaw Josey Wales\" was inspired by a 1972 novel by supposedly Cherokee writer Forrest Carter, alias of former KKK leader and segregationist speech writer of George Wallace, Asa Earl Carter, an identity that was exposed in part due to the success of the film, and was originally titled \"\" and later retitled \"Gone to Texas\". The script was worked on by Sonia Chernus and producer Robert Daley at Malpaso, and Clint Eastwood himself paid some of the money to obtain the screen rights. Michael Cimino and Philip Kaufman later oversaw the writing of the script, aiding Chernus. Kaufman wanted the film to stay as close to the novel as possible in style and retained many of the mannerisms in Josey Wales' character that Eastwood displayed on screen, such as his distinctive diction with words like \"reckon\", \"hoss\" (instead of \"horse\"), and \"ye\" (instead of \"you\"), and spitting tobacco juice on animals and victims. The characters of Wales, the Cherokee chief Lone Watie, Navajo woman Little Moonlight, and the old settler woman Sarah Turner and her granddaughter Laura Lee all appeared in the novel. On the other hand, Kaufman was less happy with the novel's political stance; he felt that it had been \"written by a crude fascist\" and that \"the man's hatred of government was insane\". He also felt that element of the script needed to be severely toned down, but he later said, \"Clint didn't, and it was his film\". Kaufman was later fired by Eastwood, who took over the film's direction himself.\nCinematographer Bruce Surtees, James Fargo, and Fritz Manes scouted for locations and eventually found sites in Page, Arizona, Tucson, Arizona, Kanab, Utah, and Oroville, California even before they saw the final script. The movie was shot in DeLuxe Color and Panavision. Kaufman cast Chief Dan George, who had been nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor in \"Little Big Man\", as the old Cherokee Lone Watie. Sondra Locke, also a previous Academy Award nominee, was cast by Eastwood against Kaufman's wishes as Laura Lee, the granddaughter of the old settler woman Sarah (Paula Trueman); at 32, she was a decade older than the character. This marked the beginning of a professional and domestic relationship between Eastwood and Locke that spanned six films and lasted into the late 1980s. Ferris Webster was hired as the film's editor and Jerry Fielding as composer.\nIn June 1975, Eastwood was announced as starring in the film, with a scheduled Bicentennial Celebration release. Principal photography began on October 6, 1975. A rift between Eastwood and Kaufman developed during the filming. Kaufman insisted on filming with a meticulous attention to detail, which caused disagreements with Eastwood, not to mention the attraction the two shared towards Locke and apparent jealousy on Kaufman's part in regard to their emerging relationship. One evening, Kaufman insisted on finding a beer can as a prop to be used in a scene, but while he was absent, Eastwood ordered Surtees to quickly shoot the scene, as light was fading, and then drove away, leaving before Kaufman had returned. On October 24, 1975, Kaufman was fired at Eastwood's command by producer Bob Daley. The sacking caused an outrage among the Directors Guild of America and other important Hollywood executives, since the director had already worked hard on the film, including completing all of the pre-production. Pressure mounted on Warner Bros. and Eastwood to back down, and their refusal to do so resulted in a fine, reported to be around $60,000, for the violation. This resulted in the Director's Guild passing a new rule, known as \"the Eastwood Rule\", which prohibits an actor or producer from firing the director and then personally taking on the director's role. From then on, the film was directed by Eastwood himself with Daley as the second-in-command. With Kaufman's planning already in place, the team was able to finish making the film efficiently. Filming ended on December 6, 1975.\nReception.\nCritical response.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n\"Eastwood is such a taciturn and action-oriented performer that it's easy to overlook the fact that he directs many of his movies\u2014and many of the best, most intelligent ones. Here, with the moody, gloomily beautiful, photography of Bruce Surtees, he creates a magnificent Western feeling.\"\nRoger Ebert\nUpon release in August 1976, \"The Outlaw Josey Wales\" was widely acclaimed by critics, many of whom saw Eastwood's role as an iconic one, relating it with much of America's ancestral past and the destiny of the nation after the American Civil War. The film was pre-screened at the Sun Valley Center for the Arts and Humanities in Idaho in a six-day conference entitled \"Western Movies: Myths and Images\". Academics such as Bruce Jackson, critics such as Jay Cocks and Arthur Knight and directors such as King Vidor, Henry King, William Wyler, and Howard Hawks were invited to the screening. \"Time\" magazine named the film one of the year's top 10. Roger Ebert compared the nature and vulnerability of Eastwood's portrayal of Josey Wales with his \"Man with No Name\" character in the \"Dollars Trilogy\" and praised the atmosphere of the film. On \"The Merv Griffin Show\", Orson Welles lauded the film, calling Eastwood \"one of America's finest directors\".\nReview aggregator Rotten Tomatoes retrospectively gave the film a 91% approval rating based on 46 reviews. The site's critical consensus reads, \"Recreating the essence of his iconic Man With No Name in a post-Civil War Western, director Clint Eastwood delivered the first of his great revisionist works of the genre.\" Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the a score of 69 out of 100, based on 9 critics, indicating .\nAwards.\n\"The Outlaw Josey Wales\" was nominated for the Academy Award for Original Music Score at the 49th Academy Awards. In 1996, it was deemed \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\" by the United States Library of Congress and selected for preservation in the National Film Registry. It was also one of the few Western films to receive critical and commercial success in the 1970s at a time when the Western was thought to be dying as a major genre in Hollywood.\nClint Eastwood says on the 1999 DVD release that the movie is \"certainly one of the high points of my career... in the Western genre of filmmaking\".\nMeaning.\nIn 2011, Eastwood called \"The Outlaw Josey Wales\" an anti-war film.\nAs for \"Josey Wales\", I saw the parallels to the modern day at that time. Everybody gets tired of it, but it never ends. A war is a horrible thing, but it's also a unifier of countries... Man becomes his most creative during war. Look at the amount of weaponry that was made in four short years of World War II\u2014the amount of ships and guns and tanks and inventions and planes and P-38s and P-51s, and just the urgency and the camaraderie, and the unifying. But that's kind of a sad statement on mankind, if that's what it takes.\nReferences.\nInformational notes\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The highway largely parallels the Atlantic coast and US\u00a01, except for the portion between Savannah, Georgia, and Washington, D.C., and the portion between Portland and Houlton in Maine, both of which follow a more direct inland route.\nI-95 serves as the principal road link between the major cities of the Eastern Seaboard. Major metropolitan areas along its route include Miami, Jacksonville, and Savannah in the Southeast; Richmond, Washington, Baltimore, Wilmington\u2013Philadelphia, Newark, and New York City in the Mid-Atlantic; and New Haven, Providence, Boston, and Portland in New England.

Many sections of I-95 incorporated preexisting sections of toll roads where they served the same right-of-way. Until 2018, there was a gap in I-95's original routing in Central New Jersey caused by the cancelation of the Somerset Freeway.

According to the Corridor Coalition, I-95 serves 110\u00a0million people and facilitates 40\u00a0percent of the country's gross domestic product.\nRoute description.\nSouth.\nFlorida.\nI-95 begins at US\u00a01 just south of downtown Miami and travels along the state's east coast, passing through Fort Lauderdale, West Palm Beach, the Gold Coast, the Treasure Coast, the Space Coast, Daytona Beach, Port Orange, St. Augustine, and Jacksonville before entering the US state of Georgia near the city of Kingsland. In Miami and Fort Lauderdale, SunPass express lanes pass over the highway.\nBefore 1987, a notable gap in the highway existed between West Palm Beach and Fort Pierce; I-95 traffic between those cities was diverted to Florida's Turnpike. Today, I-95 runs along a routing parallel to the turnpike.\nIn 2010, more fatalities occurred along the Florida section of I-95 than on any other Interstate Highway in the country.\nGeorgia.\nIn Georgia, I-95 closely parallels the coastline, traveling primarily through marshlands a few miles from the shore. The route bypasses the cores of major coastal cities Brunswick and Savannah, routing traffic through the western sides of both cities' metro areas; it connects to the latter city by an intersection with I-16 before crossing into South Carolina. The exit numbers were converted from a sequential system to a mileage-based system around 2000. I-95 in Georgia has the unsigned designation of State Route\u00a0405 (SR\u00a0405).\nSouth Carolina.\nEntering South Carolina, I-95 diverts from its coastal route to a more inland route to the west. I-95 does not go near any major cities in South Carolina, with the largest city along its route being Florence, the tenth largest in the state. The rest of South Carolina can be accessed via other Interstates that intersect I-95. It intersects I-26 near Harleyville, which provides access to Charleston, Columbia, and Upstate South Carolina. It also intersects I-20 at Florence, which also connects to Columbia and then on to Atlanta, Georgia. At the North Carolina border, I-95 passes the South of the Border roadside attraction.\nNorth Carolina.\nIn North Carolina, I-95 informally serves as the separation between the state's central Piedmont and eastern Atlantic Plain regions. Much like its route in South Carolina, I-95 runs through mostly rural areas, avoiding major cities like Raleigh and Durham. The route intersects I-74 near Lumberton, I-40 near Benson, and Future I-87/US\u00a064 near Rocky Mount. Several medium-sized cities lie along I-95 in North Carolina, including (from south to north) Fayetteville, Wilson, and Rocky Mount. At Gaston, I-95 crosses into Virginia.\nMid-Atlantic region.\nMuch of I-95 in the Mid-Atlantic region is tolled, following the course of several turnpikes that predate the Interstate Highway System, as well as several other toll roads and toll bridges.\nVirginia.\nI-95 enters the Mid-Atlantic region in Virginia and travels through the center of the densest and most populous urban region in the US. I-95 travels north\u2013south through Virginia, passing through Petersburg, and follows the Richmond\u2013Petersburg Turnpike into downtown Richmond (where it is concurrent briefly with I-64), and, from there, it turns northeast as it enters Northern Virginia. In the Washington metropolitan area, it is concurrent with the Capital Beltway from the Springfield Interchange along with I-495, before passing through the southernmost corner of the District of Columbia for about along the Woodrow Wilson Bridge before entering Maryland near National Harbor, Maryland.\nMaryland.\nIn Maryland, I-95 goes northeast toward Baltimore, paralleling the older Baltimore\u2013Washington Parkway. I-95 uses the Fort McHenry Tunnel to travel under Baltimore's Inner Harbor and travels through northeast Maryland along the John F. Kennedy Memorial Highway, crossing into Delaware near Elkton.\nDelaware.\nEntering Delaware at Newark, I-95 follows the Delaware Turnpike east across Delaware until the large and complex I-495/I-295/US\u00a0202/Delaware Route 141 interchange near Newport and turns northeast through Wilmington, skirting the west side of the downtown area before leaving Delaware in Claymont at the state's extreme northeastern corner. I-95 is the only two-digit interstate highway in Delaware, and it only passes through the Twelve-Mile Circle, the northernmost part of the state.\nPennsylvania.\nEntering southeastern Pennsylvania near Marcus Hook, I-95 crosses Delaware County and the city of Chester, closely following the Delaware River. Entering Philadelphia near Philadelphia International Airport, the freeway has an interchange with I-76 before it follows a large viaduct along the extreme eastern edge of Center City Philadelphia. Northeast of Philadelphia in Bucks County, I-95 joins the Pennsylvania Turnpike near Bristol before entering New Jersey on the Delaware River\u2013Turnpike Toll Bridge.\nNew Jersey.\nI-95 follows a course in New Jersey, starting in the south at the Pearl Harbor Memorial Turnpike Extension of the New Jersey Turnpike, crossing the Delaware River on the Delaware River\u2013Turnpike Toll Bridge, joining the mainline turnpike at exit\u00a06. I-95 has interchanges with I-78 in Newark and I-80 in southern Teaneck. At the northern end of the turnpike in Fort Lee, I-95 turns southeast and crosses over the Hudson River into New York City via the George Washington Bridge.\nNew York.\nI-95 in New York City comprises all or part of several named expressways, including the Trans-Manhattan, Cross Bronx, and Bruckner expressways, as it crosses east-northeast across the boroughs of Manhattan and the Bronx. Within this stretch, I-95 intersects I-87 in the South Bronx, which connects to Albany and Upstate New York, as well as several auxiliary Interstates that provide access to other New York City boroughs and to Long Island. Entering Westchester County in Pelham, I-95 then follows the New England Thruway northeast to the Connecticut border at Port Chester, where it continues as the Connecticut Turnpike.\nNew England.\nConnecticut.\nI-95 enters New England in the state of Connecticut, where it closely follows the state's southern coast. The highway's direction through Connecticut is primarily east\u2013west, and it passes through the most densely populated part of the state, including the cities of Stamford, Bridgeport (the state's most populous city), and New Haven. In New Haven, it intersects with I-91 as it passes into the more rural areas of the Lower Connecticut River Valley. I-95 leaves the Connecticut Turnpike at I-395 at the East Lyme\u2013Waterford town line. I-95 next passes New London and Groton, before the route curves northeast and leaving its close connection to the coast. It leaves Connecticut in the town of North Stonington.\nRhode Island.\nI-95 enters Rhode Island in the town of Hopkinton and connects the rural areas of the southwestern corner of the state with the more metropolitan region around the state capital, Providence, in the state's northeastern corner. The highway's direction through Rhode Island is primarily southwest\u2013northeast. It leaves Rhode Island in the city of Pawtucket.\nMassachusetts.\nEntering Massachusetts in Attleboro, I-95 heads northeast toward Boston. In Canton, roughly south of Boston's city limits, it turns to the west and begins a concurrency with Route\u00a0128, a beltway that traverses Boston's inner suburbs. At this point, I-93 has its southern terminus and provides access to the city of Boston itself. I-95 intersects the Massachusetts Turnpike/I-90 at the Weston\u2013Newton line and I-93 a second time at the tripoint of Woburn, Reading, and Stoneham. North of Boston, I-95 leaves the beltway and heads northward in Peabody, while Route\u00a0128 continues east to Cape Ann. I-95 leaves Massachusetts in Salisbury.\nNew Hampshire.\nI-95 enters New Hampshire in the town of Seabrook, following the pre-Interstate New Hampshire Turnpike and traversing the Seacoast Region and the historic city of Portsmouth where it leaves the state. I-95 in New Hampshire is the shortest section of the highway (excluding D.C.).\nMaine.\nIn Maine, I-95 follows the Maine Turnpike, closely following the coast in a northeasterly direction until reaching Portland, the state's largest city. From there, it turns northward to Augusta, where the Maine Turnpike ends while I-95 continues north to Palmyra, where it turns east to Bangor. From Bangor, it turns north again to Smyrna and makes a final turn to the east, reaching the Houlton\u2013Woodstock Border Crossing in Houlton. The road continues into the Canadian province of New Brunswick as Route\u00a095.\nHistory.\nMany parts of I-95 were made up of toll roads that had already been constructed or planned, particularly in the northeast. Many of these routes still exist today, but some have removed their tolls. All current I-95 toll facilities are compatible with the E-ZPass electronic payment system; in Florida, while I-95 can be driven toll-free, use of the \"95 Express Managed Toll Lanes\" requires a SunPass transponder (E-ZPass is now compatible with SunPass).\nThe toll roads utilized as part of I-95 formerly included Florida's Turnpike, the Richmond\u2013Petersburg Turnpike (tolled until 1992), and the Connecticut Turnpike (tolled until 1985). Additionally, the Fuller Warren Bridge, spanning the St. Johns River in Jacksonville, was tolled until the 1980s. Today, tolls remain on Maryland's Fort McHenry Tunnel and John F. Kennedy Memorial Highway, the Delaware Turnpike, the Pennsylvania Turnpike, the New Jersey Turnpike, New York's George Washington Bridge and New England Thruway, the New Hampshire Turnpike, and the Maine Turnpike.\nBy 1968, three states had completed their sections of I-95: Connecticut, using its existing turnpikes; New York; and Delaware.\n21st century.\nUntil 2018, a gap existed on I-95 within New Jersey. From Pennsylvania, I-95 entered the state on the Scudder Falls Bridge and continued east to US\u00a01 in Lawrence Township. Here, I-95 abruptly ended and transitioned into I-295. From New York, I-95 entered the state on the George Washington Bridge and followed the New Jersey Turnpike south to exit\u00a06, ran along the Pearl Harbor Memorial Extension, and ended on the Delaware River\u2013Turnpike Toll Bridge at the Pennsylvania state line, where the route transitioned into the Pennsylvania Turnpike (I-276). This discontinuity was caused by the 1983 cancellation of the Somerset Freeway, a planned alignment of I-95 further inland from the New Jersey Turnpike. In order to close the gap, an interchange was constructed where I-95 crosses the Pennsylvania Turnpike in Bristol Township, Pennsylvania. After the first components of the interchange opened on September 22, 2018, I-95 was rerouted onto the Pennsylvania Turnpike, meeting up with where I-95 previously ended at the state line. This project closed the last remaining gap in the route. The former section of I-95 between the Pennsylvania Turnpike and US\u00a01 in Lawrence became an extension of I-295. The interchange with the Pennsylvania Turnpike will be expanded in the future, connecting northbound I-95 with the westbound turnpike and the eastbound turnpike with southbound I-95.\nIn the 21st century, several large projects between Richmond, Virginia, and New Jersey have aimed to decrease congestion along the corridor. The reconstruction of the Springfield Interchange in Northern Virginia, just outside Washington, D.C. helped to ease traffic at the intersection of I-95, I-495, and I-395, and surrounding interchanges. The Springfield Interchange is one of the busiest highway junctions on the East Coast, serving between 400,000 and 500,000\u00a0vehicles per day. With the exception of high-occupancy toll (HOT) lanes on the Capital Beltway (I-495/I-95), this project was completed in July 2007. A few miles to the east was another major project: the Woodrow Wilson Bridge replacement. The bridge carries I-95/I-495 over the Potomac River. The former Woodrow Wilson Bridge, which has since been demolished, was a six-lane bridge that was severely overcapacity. The new bridge is actually two bridges with a total of 12\u00a0lanes; five in each direction, with an additional lane in each direction for future use (rapid-bus or train). This project was completed with the 10\u00a0lanes opened on December 13, 2008, greatly reducing the traffic delays on the beltway. The lanes are divided into two through lanes and three local lanes in each direction. About north of the Wilson Bridge, and about south of Baltimore near Laurel, Maryland, construction on a large new interchange began in 2008, was scheduled for completion in late 2011, and opened to traffic on November 9, 2014, which connects I-95 to Maryland Route 200 (MD\u00a0200).\nIn 2006, the Virginia General Assembly passed SJ184, a resolution calling for an interstate compact to build a toll highway between Dover, Delaware, and Charleston, South Carolina, as an alternative to I-95 that would allow long-distance traffic to avoid the Washington metropolitan area.\nFederal legislation has identified I-95 through Connecticut as High Priority Corridor\u00a065. A long-term multibillion-dollar program to upgrade the entire length of I-95 through Connecticut has been underway since the mid-1990s and is expected to continue through at least 2020. Several miles of the Connecticut Turnpike through Bridgeport were widened and brought up to Interstate standards. Work has shifted to reconstructing and widening of I-95 through New Haven, which includes replacing the Pearl Harbor Memorial Bridge. Environmental studies for reconstructing and widening of I-95 from New Haven to the Rhode Island state line are also progressing.\nThere are plans to expand the I-95 corridor from Petersburg, Virginia, to Florida through a US multistate agreement to study how to improve the corridor through widening and reconstruction, with the goal of reducing congestion and improving overall safety for years to come.\nI-95 from the South Carolina\u2013Georgia line to the freeway's southern terminus in South Florida has been widened to a minimum of six lanes. The section from Jacksonville to the I-4 junction in Daytona Beach was expanded to six lanes in 2005. Projects begun in 2009, widening the roadbed in Brevard County from the State Route\u00a0528 junction in Cocoa to Palm Bay, as well as in northern Palm Beach County. The last segments of I-95 in Florida to remain at only four lanes have now been upgraded, providing motorists with about of continuous six-lane roadbed.\nIn 2009, state legislators representing Maine's Aroostook County proposed using federal economic stimulus funds to extend I-95 north to Maine's northernmost border community of Fort Kent via Caribou and Presque Isle. The proposed route would parallel New Brunswick's four-lane, limited-access Trans-Canada Highway on the US side of the Canadian border. Legislators argued that extension of the Interstate would promote economic growth in the region.\nOn June 11, 2023, a portion of the northbound section of I-95 collapsed in Philadelphia. This was due to a gasoline tanker catching fire after a crash. A temporary roadway opened at the site of the collapsed bridge ten days later, on June 23, 2023.\n in Miami\n in Miami\n in Golden Glades\n in Golden Glades \n in Fort Lauderdale\n in West Palm Beach\n in Melbourne\n in Daytona Beach\n in Daytona Beach\n in Jacksonville\n in Jacksonville\n in Jacksonville.

In the Pteridophyte Phylogeny Group classification of 2016 (PPG I), it is placed in the suborder Aspleniineae. Alternatively, the family may be submerged in a very broadly defined family Aspleniaceae as the subfamily Thelypteridoideae.\nThe ferns are terrestrial, with the exception of a few which are lithophytes (grow on rocks). The bulk of the species are tropical, although there are a number of temperate species.\nThese ferns typically have creeping rhizomes. The fronds are simply pinnate to pinnate-pinnatifid. There is either no frond dimorphism or only mild dimorphism, either open venation or very simple anastomosing. The sori are mostly reniform in shape and have indusia, except for the \"Phegopteris\" group.\nClassification.\nDuring the early and mid 1900's all thelypterioid ferns were included in the genus \"Dryopteris\" because of the sorus shape. However, there are a great many differences between the groups, and these plants are now segregated in their own family. Genetic evidence shows that the family is clearly monophyletic.\nPhylogenetic relationships.\nThe following cladogram for the suborder Aspleniineae (as eupolypods II), based on Lehtonen (2011), and Rothfels &amp; al. (2012), shows a likely phylogenetic relationship between the Thelypteridaceae and the other families of the clade.\nGenera.\nThe family can be divided into two major clades, which the Pteridophyte Phylogeny Group classification of 2016 (PPG I) recognizes as two subfamilies, Phegopteridoideae and Thelypteroideae. Their division into genera has been described as \"highly controversial and fluctuating\". The family includes several complexes of species that are difficult to distinguish, and seem to represent a remarkable evolutionary radiation. Some researchers include the entire family Thelypteridaceae in the genus \"Thelypteris\"; others divide the family into as many as 30 genera. An intermediate position is to place the bulk in \"Thelypteris\" (which can then be divided into subgenera and sections corresponding to the genera of other authors) but to separate out \"Phegopteris\" and \"Macrothelypteris\". Another choice is to divide the family into a half a dozen or so genera.\nThe Pteridophyte Phylogeny Group classification of 2016 (PPG I) accepts 30 genera:\nSome species of \"Pronephrium\" were split off into other genera in 2021 as a result of a phylogenetic study of the family Thelypteridaceae:\nThe extinct genus \"Holttumopteris\" from the Cenomanian aged Burmese amber has been suggested to have affinities with the family, but several important diagnostic characters are not preserved.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Her career included commissions to design about 110 gardens for private residences, estates and country homes, public parks, botanic gardens, college campuses, and the White House. Only a few of her major works survive: Dumbarton Oaks in Washington, D.C., the Abby Aldrich Rockefeller Garden on Mount Desert, Maine, the restored Farm House Garden in Bar Harbor, the Peggy Rockefeller Rose Garden at the New York Botanical Garden (constructed after Farrand's death, using her original plans, and opened in 1988), and elements of the campuses of Princeton, Yale, and Occidental.\nFarrand was one of the founding eleven members, and the only woman, of the American Society of Landscape Architects. Beatrix Farrand is one of the most accomplished persons, and women, recognized in both the first decades of the landscape architecture profession and the centuries of landscape garden design arts and accomplishments.\nEarly years.\nBeatrix Cadwalader Jones was born in New York City on June 19, 1872, into a family among whom she liked to claim were \"five generations of gardeners.\" Her mother was Mary Cadwalader Rawle (1850\u20131923), whose father was lawyer William Henry Rawle (1823\u20131889). Her father was Frederic Rhinelander Jones (1846\u20131918), brother of novelist Edith Wharton.\nShe enjoyed long seasons at the family's summer home Reef Point Estate in Mount Desert Island, Maine. She was the niece of Edith Wharton and lifelong friend of Henry James, who called her 'Trix'. At age twenty, she was introduced to one of her primary mentors, the botanist Charles Sprague Sargent, who at Harvard University was both a professor of horticulture at the Bussey Institute and the founding director of the Arnold Arboretum in Boston, Massachusetts. Sargent named a species, \"Crataegus jonesae\", in her honor, as it was she who first noticed it and brought it to his attention.\nFarrand lived at Sargent's home, Holm Lea in Brookline, Massachusetts, in 1893 and studied landscape gardening, for which there was no specialized school at the time, botany, and land planning. She wanted to learn drafting to scale, elevation rendering, surveying, and engineering, and so studied at the Columbia School of Mines under the direction of Prof. William Ware. She was influenced in using native plant species from: her many successful Reef Point experiences; studying the contemporary books from the U.S. and abroad advocating the advantages of native palettes; and from visiting the influential British garden authors William Robinson at Gravetye Manor in Sussex, and Gertrude Jekyll at Munstead Wood in Surrey. Jekyll's series of thematic gardening books emphasized the importance and value of natural plantings and were influential in the U.S.\nOn December 17, 1913, Beatrix married Max Farrand, the accomplished historian at Stanford and Yale universities, and the first director of the Huntington Library.\nLandscape design career.\nShe began practicing landscape architecture in 1895, working from the upper floor of her mother's brownstone house on East Eleventh Street in New York. Since women were excluded from public projects, her first designs were residential gardens, beginning with some for neighbouring Bar Harbor residents. With the help of her mother and with her aunt Edith Wharton's social connections, she was introduced to prominent people, which led to working on a variety of significant projects. Within three years, she was so prominent in her field that she was chosen the only woman among the founders of the American Society of Landscape Architects, although she preferred the British term \"landscape gardener\".\nFarrand did the initial site and planting planning for the National Cathedral in Washington, D.C., in 1899. In 1912, she designed the walled residential garden, Bellefield, for Mr. and Mrs. Thomas Newbold in Hyde Park, New York (now a part of the Franklin D. Roosevelt National Historic Site). In addition to being the earliest extant example of her residential designs, this exquisite walled garden, now restored, is one of the only known pairings of works by two prominent designers of that era\u2014Farrand and the architects McKim, Mead &amp; White \u2014 who remodeled the Newbolds' eighteenth-century house. She collaborated with the firm of McKim, Mead &amp; White in the construction of service buildings at Dumbarton Oaks.\nFor the White House, the first Mrs. Woodrow Wilson, Ellen Loise Axson Wilson, had commissioned Beatrix Farrand to design the East Colonial Garden (now redesigned as the Jacqueline Kennedy Garden) and the West Garden (now the redesigned White House Rose Garden) in 1913. After Mrs. Wilson's August 1914 death, the project languished until the second Mrs. Wilson, Edith Bolling Galt Wilson, had its installation restarted and completed in 1916. She received the commission from J. Pierpont Morgan to design the grounds of Morgan's residence in New York City (later the site of the Morgan Library &amp; Museum), and continued as a consultant for thirty years (1913\u201343).\nHer most notable work was at the Dumbarton Oaks estate in the Georgetown district of Washington, D.C., for Mildred and Robert Woods Bliss (1922\u20131940). Her design was inspired by her European ventures, especially from the Italian Renaissance gardens, and consisted of establishing a sophisticated relationship between the architectural and natural environments, with formal terraced gardens stepping down a steep slope and transitioning to a more naturalistic aesthetic approaching the creek.\nIn 1928, her husband accepted the position as the first Director of The Huntington Library (1927\u201341) in San Marino, California. They moved to California, but Farrand had trouble building a clientele in that state. William Hertrich had long-standing dominion of the Botanical Gardens at the Huntington. The landscape designers Florence Yoch and Louise Council, and Lockwood DeForest Jr., among others, were already well-established there. Her few projects came via friends, such as the Bliss winter and retirement estate, \"Casa Dorinda\", in Montecito, California, and the patronage of Mildred Bliss's mother, Anna Blakely Bliss, for the nearby Santa Barbara Botanic Garden project. In the Los Angeles area, she had several commissions each with astronomer George Ellery Hale and architect Myron Hunt. With the latter she worked on projects at Occidental College and the California Institute of Technology (Caltech).\nFarrand commuted cross-country by train for her eastern projects, such as the design and supervision of the Chinese inspired garden at 'The Eyrie' for Abby Aldrich Rockefeller in Seal Harbor, Maine (1926\u201335). This was the era of the automobile, and in her designs Farrand applied principles learned earlier from Frederick Law Olmsted's drives at the Arnold Arboretum and the Biltmore Estate of George Washington Vanderbilt II. John D. Rockefeller Jr. sought out and funded Farrand to design planting plans for subtle carriage roads at Acadia National Park on Mount Desert Island, Maine, near her Reef Point home (c.1930). Their use continues at the Park.\nExtant Farrand private gardens in the eastern U.S. are: the Bliss family's Dumbarton Oaks in Georgetown, Washington, D.C.; the Harkness summer home 'Eolia' in Waterford, Connecticut (1918\u20131924), now preserved as the Harkness Memorial State Park; and the Rockefellers' estate 'The Eyrie' in Seal Harbor, Maine. She also collaborated with Edith Wharton on landscape and garden design for The Mount, Wharton's home in Lenox, Massachusetts, which is open to visitors from May\u2013October. Henry James introduced her to Theodate Pope Riddle, \"one of her most fascinating clients\", who owned the estate 'Hill-Stead' (1913), now preserved as the Hill-Stead Museum in Farmington, Connecticut. In 1942, with Walter Macomber, she designed the gardens at Green Spring, near Alexandria, Virginia.\nThe Santa Barbara Botanic Garden, for California native plants, represents her talent in Santa Barbara, California. In England, her evolving major project, 'Dartington Hall', was for heiress Dorothy Payne Elmhirst in Devon (1932\u201337). The Reef Point Collection of her library, drawings and herbarium specimens are archived in the Environmental Design Archives at the College of Environmental Design at the University of California, Berkeley campus, except for the Dumbarton Oaks documents located at the library there, and the Arnold Arboretum drawings in their archives, both under the stewardship of Harvard.\nIn 2014, Farrand was recognized for her work designing the Peggy Rockefeller Rose Garden at New York Botanical Garden, a winning site of Built by Women New York City, a competition launched by the Beverly Willis Architecture Foundation during the fall of 2014 to identify outstanding and diverse sites and spaces designed, engineered and built by women.\nCollege campuses.\nFarrand's campus designs were based on three concepts: plants that bloomed throughout the academic year, emphasizing architecture as well as hiding flaws, and using upright and climbing plants so that the small spaces between buildings would not seem reduced in scale. Her designs are noted for their practicality, simplicity and ease of maintenance. She was the first consulting landscape architect for Princeton University in Princeton, New Jersey (1912\u201343).\nAs new buildings are constructed at Princeton now, architects are often referred to Farrand's papers at U.C. Berkeley. She was the consulting landscape architect at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut, for twenty-three years (1923\u201345), with projects including the Marsh Botanical Garden. She later went on to improve a dozen other campuses including the University of Chicago (1929\u201343), along with Southern California's Occidental College and the California Institute of Technology. Beatrix Farrand completed design work for the Pennsylvania School of Horticulture for Women (1931\u201332). Later, she was also the landscape consultant to the Arnold Arboretum of Harvard University (1946\u201350).\nLater years and death.\nDuring the last part of her life, Farrand devoted herself to creating a landscape study center at Reef Point, Maine. Here she continued developing the extensive garden and preparing the property for a transition to a public study center. She published the \"Reef Point Gardens Bulletin\" (1946\u201355), in which she reported on the progress of the gardens and center.\nAfter a wildfire on the island and facing a lack of funding to complete and ensure the continued operation of a center she made a remarkable decision in 1955 to discontinue the preparations, dismantle the garden, sell the property, and use the proceeds for her last years. John D. Rockefeller Jr. purchased all Reef Point's larger plants for his Asticou Azalea Garden in Northeast Harbor, Maine, which continue to flower. Approximately 2,000 herbarium specimens were given to the University and Jepson Herbaria at the University of California, Berkeley, where they serve as a permanent record of her choice of plants and localities.\nFarrand lived at and spent the last three years of her life at Garland Farm, the home of her friends Lewis and Amy Magdalene Garland, on Mount Desert Island, Maine. It was here that she created her final garden, an intimate space in keeping with the size of the property. At age 86, Farrand died at the Mount Desert Island Hospital on February 28, 1959.\nThe Garland Farm was purchased by the Beatrix Farrand Society on January 9, 2004. The society's mission is \"to foster the art and science of horticulture and landscape design, with emphasis on the life and work of Beatrix Farrand\". It plans to continue Reef Point's original educational mission as well as to preserve Garland Farm and Beatrix Farrand's final garden.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It involves the systematic design and general engineering of various structures for construction and human use, investigation of existing social, ecological, and soil conditions and processes in the landscape, and the design of other interventions that will produce desired outcomes.\nThe scope of the profession is broad and can be subdivided into several sub-categories including professional or licensed landscape architects who are regulated by governmental agencies and possess the expertise to design a wide range of structures and landforms for human use; landscape design which is not a licensed profession; site planning; stormwater management; erosion control; environmental restoration; public realm, parks, recreation and urban planning; visual resource management; green infrastructure planning and provision; and private estate and residence landscape master planning and design; all at varying scales of design, planning and management. A practitioner in the profession of landscape architecture may be called a landscape architect; however, in jurisdictions where professional licenses are required it is often only those who possess a landscape architect license who can be called a landscape architect.\nDefinition of landscape architecture.\nModern landscape architecture is a multi-disciplinary field, incorporating aspects of urban design, architecture, geography, ecology, civil engineering, structural engineering, horticulture, environmental psychology, industrial design, soil sciences, botany, and fine arts. The activities of a landscape architect can range from the creation of public parks and parkways to site planning for campuses and corporate office parks; from the design of residential estates to the design of civil infrastructure; and from the management of large wilderness areas to reclamation of degraded landscapes such as mines or landfills. Landscape architects work on structures and external spaces in the landscape aspect of the design \u2013 large or small, urban, suburban and rural, and with \"hard\" (built) and \"soft\" (planted) materials, while integrating ecological sustainability.\nThe most valuable contribution can be made at the first stage of a project to generate ideas with technical understanding and creative flair for the design, organization, and use of spaces. The landscape architect can conceive the overall concept and prepare the master plan, from which detailed design drawings and technical specifications are prepared. They can also review proposals to authorize and supervise contracts for the construction work. Other skills include preparing design impact assessments, conducting environmental assessments and audits, and serving as an expert witness at inquiries on land use issues. The majority of their time will most likely be spent inside an office building designing and preparing models for clients.\nHistory.\nFor the period before 1800, the history of landscape gardening (later called landscape architecture) is largely that of master planning and garden design for manor houses, palaces and royal properties. An example is the extensive work by Andr\u00e9 Le N\u00f4tre for King Louis XIV of France on the Gardens of Versailles. The first person to write of \"making\" a landscape was Joseph Addison in 1712. The term landscape architecture was invented by Gilbert Laing Meason in 1828, and John Claudius Loudon (1783\u20131843) was instrumental in the adoption of the term landscape architecture by the modern profession. He took up the term from Meason and gave it publicity in his Encyclopedias and in his 1840 book on the \"Landscape Gardening and Landscape Architecture of the Late Humphry Repton\".\nJohn Claudius Loudon was an established and influential horticultural journalist and Scottish landscape architect whose writings were instrumental in shaping Victorian taste in gardens, public parks, and architecture. In the \"Landscape Gardening and Landscape Architecture of the Late Humphry Repton,\" Loudon describes two distinct styles of landscape gardening existing at the beginning of the 19th century: geometric and natural. Loudon wrote that each style reflected a different stage of society. The geometric style was \u201cmost striking and pleasing,\u201d displaying wealth and taste in an \u201cearly state of society\u201d and in \u201ccountries where the general scenery was wild, irregular, and natural, and man, comparatively, uncultivated and unrefined.\u201d The natural style was used in \u201cmodern times\u201d and in countries where \u201csociety is in a higher state of cultivation,\" displaying wealth and taste through the sacrifice of profitable lands to make room for such designs.\nThe prominent English landscape designer Humphry Repton (1752-1818) echoed similar ideas in his work and design ideas. In his writings on the use of delineated spaces (e.g. courtyards, terrace walls, fences), Repton states that while the motive for defense no longer exists, the features are still useful in separating \"the gardens, which belong to man, and the forest, or desert, which belongs to the wild denizens.\" Repton refers to Indigenous peoples as \"uncivilized human beings, against whom some decided line of defense was absolutely necessary.\u201d\nThe practice of landscape architecture spread from the Old to the New World. The term \"landscape architect\" was used as a professional title by Frederick Law Olmsted in the United States in 1863 and Andrew Jackson Downing, another early American landscape designer, was editor of \"The Horticulturist\" magazine (1846\u201352). In 1841 his first book, \"A Treatise on the Theory and Practice of Landscape Gardening, Adapted to North America\", was published to a great success; it was the first book of its kind published in the United States. During the latter 19th century, the term landscape architect began to be used by professional landscapes designers, and was firmly established after Frederick Law Olmsted Jr. and Beatrix Jones (later Farrand) with others founded the American Society of Landscape Architects (ASLA) in 1899. IFLA was founded at Cambridge, England, in 1948 with Sir Geoffrey Jellicoe as its first president, representing 15 countries from Europe and North America. Later, in 1978, IFLA's Headquarters were established in Versailles.\nFields of activity.\nThe variety of the professional tasks that landscape architects collaborate on is very broad, but some examples of project types include:\nLandscape managers use their knowledge of landscape processes to advise on the long-term care and development of the landscape. They often work in forestry, nature conservation and agriculture.\nLandscape scientists have specialist skills such as soil science, hydrology, geomorphology or botany that they relate to the practical problems of landscape work. Their projects can range from site surveys to the ecological assessment of broad areas for planning or management purposes. They may also report on the impact of development or the importance of particular species in a given area.\nLandscape planners are concerned with landscape planning for the location, scenic, ecological and recreational aspects of urban, rural, and coastal land use. Their work is embodied in written statements of policy and strategy, and their remit includes master planning for new developments, landscape evaluations and assessments, and preparing countryside management or policy plans. Some may also apply an additional specialism such as landscape archaeology or law to the process of landscape planning.\nGreen roof (or more specifically, vegetative roof) designers design extensive and intensive roof gardens for stormwater management, evapo-transpirative cooling, sustainable architecture, aesthetics, and habitat creation.\nRelation to urban planning.\nThrough the 19th century, urban planning became a focal point and central issue in cities. The combination of the tradition of landscape gardening and the emerging field of urban planning offered landscape architecture an opportunity to serve these needs. In the second half of the century, Frederick Law Olmsted completed a series of parks that continue to have a significant influence on the practices of landscape architecture today. Among these were Central Park in New York City, Prospect Park in Brooklyn, New York and Boston's Emerald Necklace park system. Jens Jensen designed sophisticated and naturalistic urban and regional parks for Chicago, Illinois, and private estates for the Ford family including Fair Lane and Gaukler Point. One of the original eleven founding members of the American Society of Landscape Architects (ASLA), and the only woman, was Beatrix Farrand. She was design consultant for over a dozen universities including: Princeton in Princeton, New Jersey; Yale in New Haven, Connecticut; and the Arnold Arboretum for Harvard in Boston, Massachusetts. Her numerous private estate projects include the landmark Dumbarton Oaks in the Georgetown neighborhood of Washington, D.C. Since that time, other architects \u2013 most notably Ruth Havey and Alden Hopkins \u2013 changed certain elements of the Farrand design.\nSince this period urban planning has developed into a separate independent profession that has incorporated important contributions from other fields such as civil engineering, architecture and public administration. Urban Planners are qualified to perform tasks independent of landscape architects, and in general, the curriculum of landscape architecture programs do not prepare students to become urban planners.\nLandscape architecture continues to develop as a design discipline and to respond to the various movements in architecture and design throughout the 20th and 21st centuries. Thomas Church was a pioneering mid-century landscape architect known for shaping modern American garden design. Roberto Burle Marx in Brazil combined the International style and native Brazilian plants and culture for a new aesthetic. Innovation continues today solving challenging problems with contemporary design solutions for master planning, landscapes, and gardens.\nIan McHarg was known for introducing environmental concerns in landscape architecture. He popularized a system of analyzing the layers of a site in order to compile a complete understanding of the qualitative attributes of a place. This system became the foundation of today's Geographic Information Systems (GIS). McHarg would give every qualitative aspect of the site a layer, such as the history, hydrology, topography, vegetation, etc. GIS software is ubiquitously used in the landscape architecture profession today to analyze materials in and on the Earth's surface and is similarly used by urban planners, geographers, forestry and natural resources professionals, etc.\nEuropean nations enabled the widespread circulation of urban planning strategies by transferring landscaping ideas and practices to overseas colonies. The green belt was a popular landscape practice exported by Britain onto colonial territories such as Haifa (1918-1948). Spatial mechanisms like the green belt, implemented through the Haifa Bay Plan and the British \"Grand Model,\" were used to enforce political control and civic order and extend western ideas of progress and development. The Greater London Regional Planning Committee accepted the green belt concept which formed the basis of the 1938 Green Belt Act. The planning prototype demarcated open spaces, distinguished between city and countryside, limited urban growth, and created zoning divisions. It was used extensively in the British colonies to facilitate British rule through the organized division of landscape and populations.\nRelation to Indigenous practices.\nIndigenous land management practices create constantly changing landscapes through the use of vegetation and natural systems, contrasting with western epistemologies of the discipline that separate ornament from function. The discipline of landscape architecture favors western designs made from structured materials and geometric forms. Landscape architecture history books tend to include projects that contain constructed architectural elements that persist over time, excluding many Indigenous landscape-based designs.\nLandscape architecture textbooks often place Indigenous peoples as a prefix to the official start of the discipline. The widely read landscape history text \"The Landscape of Man\" (1964) offers a global history of the designed landscape from past to present, featuring African and other Indigenous peoples in its discussions of Paleolithic man between 500,000 and 8,000 BCE in relation to human migration. Indigenous land-management practices are described as archaeological rather than a part of contemporary practice. \"Gardens in Time\" (1980) also places Indigenous practice as prehistory at the beginning of the landscape architecture timeline. Authors John and Ray Oldham describe Aborigines of Australia as \"survivors of an ancient way of life\" who provide an opportunity to examine western Australia as a \"meeting place of a prehistoric man\".\nIn the late 18th century, the landscapes created by aboriginal land and fire management practices appealed to English settlers in Australia. Journals from the period of early white settlement note the landscape resembling parks and popular designs in English landscape gardens of the same period. In England, these designs were considered sophisticated and celebrated for the intentional sacrifice of usable land. In Australia, the park-like condition was used to justify British control, citing its emptiness and lack of productive use as a basis for the dispossession of Aboriginal people.\nEducation.\nLandscape architects are generally required to have university or graduate education from an accredited landscape architecture degree program, which can vary in length and degree title. They learn how to create projects from scratch, such as residential or commercial planting and designing outdoor living spaces. They are willing to work with others to get a better outcome for the customers when doing a project, and learn the basics of how to create a project on a manner of time, how to interact with clients and how to explain a design from scratch when presenting a final project.\nProfession.\nIn many countries, a professional institute, comprising members of the professional community, exists in order to protect the standing of the profession and promote its interests, and sometimes also regulate the practice of landscape architecture. The standard and strength of legal regulations governing landscape architecture practice varies from nation to nation, with some requiring licensure in order to practice; and some having little or no regulation. In Europe, North America, parts of South America, Australia, India, and New Zealand, landscape architecture is a regulated profession.\nArgentina.\nSince 1889, with the arrival of the French architect and urbanist landscaper Carlos Thays, recommended to recreate the National Capital's parks and public gardens, it was consolidated an apprentice and training program in landscaping that eventually became a regulated profession, currently the leading academic institution is the UBA University of Buenos Aires\"UBA Facultad de Arquitectura, Dise\u00f1o y Urbanismo\" (Faculty of Architecture, Design and Urbanism) offering a Bacherlor's degree in Urban Landscaping Design and Planning, the profession itself is regulated by the National Ministry of Urban Planning of Argentina and the Institute of the Buenos Aires Botanical Garden.\nAustralia.\nThe Australian Institute of Landscape Architects (AILA) provides accreditation of university degrees and non-statutory professional registration for landscape architects. Once recognized by AILA, landscape architects use the title 'Registered Landscape Architect' across the six states and territories within Australia.\nAILA's system of professional recognition is a national system overseen by the AILA National Office in Canberra. To apply for AILA Registration, an applicant usually needs to satisfy a number of pre-requisites, including university qualification, a minimum number years of practice and a record of professional experience.\nLandscape Architecture within Australia covers a broad spectrum of planning, design, management, and research. From specialist design services for government and private sector developments through to specialist professional advice as an expert witness.\nCanada.\nIn Canada, landscape architecture, like law and medicine, is a self-regulating profession pursuant to provincial statute. For example, Ontario's profession is governed by the Ontario Association of Landscape Architects pursuant to the \"Ontario Association of Landscape Architects Act\". Landscape architects in Ontario, British Columbia, and Alberta must complete the specified components of L.A.R.E (Landscape Architecture Registration Examination) as a prerequisite to full professional standing.\nProvincial regulatory bodies are members of a national organization, the Canadian Society of Landscape Architects / L'Association des Architectes Paysagistes du Canada (CSLA-AAPC), and individual membership in the CSLA-AAPC is obtained through joining one of the provincial or territorial components.\nIndonesia.\nISLA (Indonesia Society of Landscape Architects) is the Indonesian society for professional landscape architects formed on 4 February 1978 and is a member of IFLA APR and IFLA World. The main aim is to increase the dignity of the professional members of landscape architects by increasing their activity role in community service, national and international development. The management of IALI consists of National Administrators who are supported by 20 Regional Administrators (Provincial level) and 3 Branch Managers at city level throughout Indonesia.\nLandscape architecture education in Indonesia was held in 18 universities, which graduated D3, Bachelor and Magister graduates. The landscape architecture education incorporate in Association of Indonesian Landscape Architecture Education.\nItaly.\nAIAPP (Associazione Italiana Architettura del Paesaggio) is the Italian association of professional landscape architects formed in 1950 and is a member of IFLA and IFLA Europe (formerly known as EFLA). AIAPP is in the process of contesting this new law which has given the Architects' Association the new title of Architects, Landscape Architects, Planners and Conservationists whether or not they have had any training or experience in any of these fields other than Architecture.\nIn Italy, there are several different professions involved in landscape architecture:\nNew Zealand.\nThe New Zealand Institute of Landscape Architects (NZILA) is the professional body for Landscape Architects in NZ.\nIn April 2013, NZILA jointly with AILA, hosted the 50th International Federation of Landscape Architects (IFLA) World Congress in Auckland, New Zealand. The World Congress is an international conference where Landscape Architects from all around the globe meet to share ideas around a particular topic.\nWithin NZ, Members of NZILA when they achieve their professional standing, can use the title Registered Landscape Architect NZILA.\nNZILA provides an education policy and an accreditation process to review education programme providers; currently there are three accredited undergraduate Landscape Architecture programmes in New Zealand. Lincoln University also has an accredited masters programme in landscape architecture.\nNorway.\nLandscape architecture in Norway was established in 1919 at the Norwegian University of Life Sciences (NMBU) at \u00c5s. The Norwegian School of Landscape Architecture at the Faculty of Landscape and Society is responsible for Europe's oldest landscape architecture education on an academic level. The departments areas include design and design of cities and places, garden art history, landscape engineering, greenery, zone planning, site development, place making and place keeping.\nSouth Africa.\nIn May 1962, Joane Pim, Ann Sutton, Peter Leutscher and Roelf Botha (considered the forefathers of the profession in South Africa) established the Institute for Landscape Architects, now known as the Institute for Landscape Architecture in South Africa (ILASA). ILASA is a voluntary organisation registered with the South African Council for the Landscape Architectural Profession (SACLAP). It consists of three regional bodies, namely, Gauteng, KwaZula-Natal and the Western Cape. ILASA's mission is to advance the profession of landscape architecture and uphold high standards of professional service to its members, and to represent the profession of landscape architecture in any matter which may affect the interests of the members of the institute. ILASA holds the country's membership with The International Federation of Landscape Architects (IFLA).\nIn South Africa, the profession is regulated by SACLAP, established as a statutory council in terms of Section 2 of the South African Council for the Landscape Architectural Profession Act \u2013 Act 45 of 2000. The Council evolved out of the Board of Control for Landscape Architects (BOCLASA), which functioned under the Council of Architects in terms of The Architectural Act, Act 73 of 1970. SACLAP's mission is to establish, direct, sustain and ensure a high level of professional responsibilities and ethical conduct within the art and science of landscape architecture with honesty, dignity and integrity in the broad interest of public health, safety and welfare of the community.\nAfter completion of an accredited under-graduate and/or post-graduate qualification in landscape architecture at either the University of Cape Town or the University of Pretoria, or landscape technology at the Cape Peninsula University of Technology, professional registration is attained via a mandatory mentored candidacy period (minimum of two years) and sitting of the professional registration exam. After successfully completing the exam, the individual is entitled to the status of Professional Landscape Architect or Professional Landscape Technologist.\nSweden.\nArchitects Sweden, Sveriges Arkitekter, is the collective trade union and professional organisation for all architects, including landscape architects, in Sweden. The professional body is a member of IFLA (International Federation of Landscape Architects) as well as IFLA Europe.\nAs a landscape architect, anyone can become a member of Architects Sweden if they have a national or international university degree that is approved by the association. If the degree is from within the European Union,\u00a0Architects Sweden approves Landscape architect educations listed by IFLA Europe. For educations outside the EU, the association makes an assessment on a statement from the Swedish Council for Higher Education (UHR).\nUnited Kingdom.\nThe UK's professional body is the Landscape Institute (LI). It is a chartered body that accredits landscape professionals and university courses. At present there are fifteen accredited programmes in the UK. Membership of the LI is available to students, academics and professionals, and there are over 3,000 professionally qualified members.\nThe Institute provides services to assist members including support and promotion of the work of landscape architects; information and guidance to the public and industry about the specific expertise offered by those in the profession; and training and educational advice to students and professionals looking to build upon their experience.\nIn 2008, the LI launched a major recruitment drive entitled \"I want to be a Landscape Architect\" to encourage the study of Landscape Architecture. The campaign aimed to raise the profile of landscape architecture and highlight its valuable role in building sustainable communities and fighting climate change.\nAs of July 2018, the \"I want to be a Landscape Architect\" initiative was replaced by a brand new careers campaign entitled \"#ChooseLandscape\", which aims to raise awareness of landscape as a profession; improve and increase access to landscape education; and inspire young people to choose landscape as a career. This new campaign includes other landscape-related professions such as landscape management, landscape planning, landscape science and urban design.\nUnited States.\nIn the United States, landscape architecture is regulated by individual state governments. For a landscape architect, obtaining licensure requires advanced education and work experience, plus passage of the national examination called the Landscape Architect Registration Examination (L.A.R.E.). Licensing is overseen at the national level by the Council of Landscape Architectural Registration Boards (CLARB). Several states require passage of a state exam as well.\nLandscape architecture has been identified as an above-average growth profession by the US Bureau of Labor Statistics and was listed in \"U.S. News &amp; World Report\"'s list of Best Jobs to Have in 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009 and 2010. The national trade association for United States landscape architects is the American Society of Landscape Architects. Frederick Law Olmsted, who designed Central Park in New York City, is known as the \"father of American landscape architecture\".\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The mission of the agency is: \"working with others to conserve, protect, and enhance fish, wildlife, plants and their habitats for the continuing benefit of the American people\".\nHistory.\nFish Commission and Bureau of Fisheries.\nThe original ancestor of the agency was the United States Commission on Fish and Fisheries, more commonly referred to as the United States Fish Commission, created in 1871 by the United States Congress with the purpose of studying and recommending solutions to a noted decline in the stocks of food fish. Spencer Fullerton Baird was appointed to lead it as the first United States Commissioner of Fisheries. In 1903, the Fish Commission was reorganized as the United States Bureau of Fisheries and made part of the United States Department of Commerce and Labor. \nWhen the Department of Commerce and Labor was split into the United States Department of Commerce and the United States Department of Labor in 1913, the Bureau of Fisheries was made part of the Department of Commerce. Originally focused on fisheries science and fish culture, the Bureau of Fisheries also assumed other duties; in 1906, the U.S. Congress assigned it the responsibility for the enforcement of fishery and fur seal-hunting regulations in the District of Alaska, and in 1910 for the management and harvest of northern fur seals, foxes, and other fur-bearing animals in the Pribilof Islands, as well as for the care, education, and welfare of the Aleut communities in the islands. In 1939, the Bureau of Fisheries moved from the Department of Commerce to the Department of the Interior.\nBureau of Biological Survey.\nThe other ancestor of the agency began as the Section of Economic Ornithology, which was established within the United States Department of Agriculture in 1885 and became the Division of Economic Ornithology and Mammalogy in 1886. In 1896 it became the Division of Biological Survey. Clinton Hart Merriam headed the Division for 25 years and became a national figure for improving the scientific understanding of birds and mammals in the United States.\nBy 1905 with funding scarce, the Survey included in its mission the eradication of wolves, coyotes and other large predators. This garnered them the support of ranchers and western legislators resulting, by 1914, in a $125,000 congressionally approved budget for destroying wolves, coyotes and other animals injurious to agriculture and animal husbandry. Meanwhile, scientists like Joseph Grinnell and Charles C. Adams, a founder of the Ecological Society of America, were promoting a balance of nature. In 1924, at a conference organized by the American Society of Mammalogists, the debate generated a public split between those in the Survey, promoting eradication, and the mammalogists who promoted some sort of accommodation. The Survey subsequently placed over 2 million poisoned bait stations across the west. The Survey then turned to the eradication of coyote, coordinated through the https://.\nIn 1934, the Division of Biological Survey was reorganized as the Bureau of Biological Survey and Jay Norwood Darling was appointed its chief;. The same year, Congress passed the Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act, one of the oldest federal environmental review statutes. Under Darling's guidance, the Bureau began an ongoing legacy of protecting vital natural habitat throughout the United States. In 1939, the Bureau of Biological Survey moved from the Department of Agriculture to the Department of the Interior.\nFish and Wildlife Service.\nOn June 30, 1940, the Bureau of Fisheries and the Bureau of Biological Survey were combined to form the Department of the Interior's Fish and Wildlife Service. In 1956, the Fish and Wildlife Service was reorganized as the United States Fish and Wildlife Service \u2014 which remained part of the Department of the Interior \u2014 and divided its operations into two bureaus, the Bureau of Sport Fisheries and Wildlife and the Bureau of Commercial Fisheries, with the latter inheriting the history and heritage of the old U.S. Fish Commission and U.S. Bureau of Fisheries.\nIn 1970, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration was formed within the Department of Commerce. That year, the Bureau of Commercial Fisheries merged with the saline water laboratories of the Bureau of Sport Fisheries and Wildlife. This led to the creation of today's National Marine Fisheries Service, which also acquired the former fleet of the United States Fish and Wildlife Service.\nThe use of poisoned bait stations continued into the early 1970s. Although it resulted in the deaths of hundreds of thousands of coyotes, this method failed to significantly reduce their population. Instead, due to their remarkable adaptability and resilience, coyotes migrated into a wider range of habitats, even venturing into urban areas. Driven by growing environmental awareness in the late 1960s and early 1970s, Richard Nixon banned poisons used since the Second World War and signed the Endangered Species Act of 1973. In 1985 Ronald Reagan reversed the poison killing ban and transferred the responsibility for predator control to the Wildlife Services program under the Department of Agriculture.\nHabitat conservation.\nThe agency plays a vital role in wildlife and habitat conservation through various key functions, including protecting native species, managing migratory bird populations, restoring fisheries to support ecosystems, conserving vital habitats like wetlands, and overseeing wildlife efforts on military bases per the Sikes Act.\nNational Wildlife Refuge System.\nThe agency manages the National Wildlife Refuge System, guided by the National Wildlife Refuge System Administration Act of 1966, which consists of 570 National Wildlife Refuges, encompassing a full range of habitat types, including wetlands, prairies, coastal and marine areas, and temperate, tundra, and boreal forests spread across all 50 U.S. states. It also manages thousands of small wetlands and other areas covering over 150 million acres.\nNational Monuments.\nThe agency participates in the governance of six National Monuments:\nEndangered species.\nThe agency shares responsibility for administering the Endangered Species Act of 1973 with the National Marine Fisheries Service. The latter is responsible for marine species, while the agency oversees freshwater fish and all other species. The two organizations jointly manage species that inhabit both marine and non-marine environments. To manage the listing process, a listing priority number is assigned to candidate species to reflect the relative urgency of listing them as threatened or endangered when an immediate listing is not feasible. The agency publishes the quarterly \"Endangered Species Bulletin\".\nNational Conservation Training Center.\nThe https:// trains employees and partners in the accomplishment of the agency's mission. The vast majority of fish and wildlife habitats are on state or private land not controlled by the United States government. Therefore, the agency's Partners for Fish and Wildlife program works closely with private groups such as Partners in Flight, National Wildlife Refuge Association, and the Landscape conservation cooperatives to promote voluntary habitat conservation and restoration.\nMigratory bird program.\nThe Migratory Bird Program aims to protect and conserve bird populations and habitats. It ensures ecological sustainability, enhances opportunities for birdwatching and other outdoor activities, and promotes awareness of the importance of migratory birds. To achieve these goals, the program utilizes resources such as the National Wetlands Inventory to map and monitor critical wetland habitats. The program conducts surveys, coordinates conservation partnerships, offers conservation grants, develops policies, and manages conservation laws, such as the Migratory Bird Conservation Act, educates children, and provides resources for engaging with nature and birds. \nFederal Duck Stamp.\nThe agency organizes the annual art competition for the Federal Duck Stamp, formally known as the Migratory Bird Hunting and Conservation Stamp, a collectable adhesive stamp required for waterfowl hunting. It also allows access to National Wildlife Refuges without paying an admission fee. Since 1934, sales of Federal Duck Stamps have generated over $1.2 billion, which has enabled the conservation of more than 6 million acres of wetlands habitat. This makes the Duck Stamp one of the most successful wetland conservation revenue programs in history, with over 98% of the funds directly supporting the acquisition of wetlands and conservation easements for the National Wildlife Refuge System.\nRestoring fisheries.\nThe agency oversees the National Fish Hatchery System which includes 71 fish hatcheries and 65 conservation offices. Originally created to reverse declines in lake and coastal fish stocks, the program subsequently expanded its mission to include the preservation of the genes of wild and hatchery-raised fish. The fish hatcheries contribute to the restoration of native fish populations, freshwater mussels, and amphibians including populations of species listed under the Endangered Species Act, and providing fish to benefit Native Americans and nature reserves.\nThe National Fish Passage Program provides financial and technical resources to projects that promote the free movement of fish and aquatic life. Common projects include dam removal and fishway construction. Between 1999 and 2023, the program has worked with over 2,000 local partners to open of upstream habitat by removing or bypassing 3,400 aquatic barriers. The agency also plays a key role both in protecting sensitive marine coastal ecosystems under the Coastal Barrier Resources Act and in conducting evaluations of the impacts on fish and wildlife resulting from proposed water resources development projects, in accordance with the Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act.\nLaw enforcement.\nThe Office of Law Enforcement enforces wildlife laws such as the Marine Mammal Protection Act, the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918, and the Lacey Act of 1900. The Refuge Law Enforcement officers safeguard National Wildlife Refuges, playing a vital role in preventing habitat destruction. The office also provides training to law enforcement officers, and collaborates with tribal partners to conserve wildlife resources. \nThe International Affairs Program coordinates national and global initiatives to protect, restore, and enhance wildlife and habitats, with a focus on species of international concern. It fulfills obligations under international treaties, such as CITES. The program collaborates with private citizens, local communities, government agencies, conservation organizations, and other stakeholders to implement treaties and laws and conserve species worldwide.\nFish and Wildlife Forensic Laboratory.\nThe agency operates the Clark R. Bavin National Fish and Wildlife Forensic Laboratory, the only forensics laboratory in the world devoted to wildlife law enforcement. By treaty, it also is the official crime laboratory for CITES and Interpol. The laboratory identifies the species or subspecies of pieces, parts, or products of an animal to determine its cause of death, help wildlife officers determine if a violation of law occurred in its death, and to identify and compare physical evidence to link suspects to the crime scene and the animal's death.\nTribal relations.\nPursuant to the \"Eagle feather law\" and the \"Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act\", the agency administers the National Eagle Repository and the permit system for Native American religious use of eagle feathers. These exceptions often only apply to Native Americans that are registered with the federal government and are enrolled with a federally recognized tribe.\nIn the late 1990s and early 2000s, the agency began to incorporate the research of tribal scientists into conservation decisions. This came on the heels of Native American traditional ecological knowledge gaining acceptance in the scientific community as a reasonable and respectable way to gain knowledge of managing the natural world. Additionally, other natural resource agencies within the United States government, such as the United States Department of Agriculture, have taken steps to be more inclusive of tribes, native people, and tribal rights. This has marked a transition to a relationship of more co-operation rather than the tension between tribes and government agencies seen historically. Today, these agencies work closely with tribal governments to ensure the best conservation decisions are made and that tribes retain their sovereignty.\nIn popular culture.\nTom Lehrer's satirical song, \"Poisoning Pigeons in the Park\", gained notoriety in 1959 for its criticism against the agency's Animal Damage Control program's cruel practice of poisoning pigeons. This program was in 1985 transferred to the Department of Agriculture and renamed Wildlife Services.\nIn the 2017 contemporary Western crime film \"Wind River\", Jeremy Renner plays a U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service tracker who teams up with an FBI agent to solve a murder in the Wind River Indian Reservation.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Like many of Stephenson's novels, its themes include history, linguistics, anthropology, archaeology, religion, computer science, politics, cryptography, memetics, and philosophy.\nIn his 1999 essay \"In the Beginning... Was the Command Line\", Stephenson explained the title of the novel as his term for a particular software failure mode on the early Macintosh computer. Stephenson wrote, \"When the computer crashed and wrote gibberish into the bitmap, the result was something that looked vaguely like static on a broken television set\u2014a 'snow crash'\". Stephenson has also mentioned that Julian Jaynes' book \"The Origin of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind\" was one of the main influences on \"Snow Crash\".\n\"Snow Crash\" was nominated for both the British Science Fiction Award in 1993 and the Arthur C. Clarke Award in 1994.\nPlot.\nPlot background.\nIn the 21st century, an unspecified number of years after a worldwide economic collapse, Los Angeles is no longer part of the United States since the federal government has ceded most of its power and territory to private organizations and entrepreneurs. Franchising, individual sovereignty, and private vehicles reign supreme. Mercenary armies compete for national defense contracts, while private security guards preserve the peace in sovereign gated housing developments.45 Highway companies compete to attract drivers to their roads,7 and all mail delivery is by hired courier.306 The remnants of government maintain authority only in isolated compounds, where they do tedious make-work that is, by and large, irrelevant to the society around them.176 Much of the world's territory has been carved up into sovereign enclaves known as Franchise-Organized Quasi-National Entities (FOQNEs),14 each run by its own big business franchise (such as \"Mr.\u00a0Lee's Greater Hong Kong\", or the corporatized American Mafia), or various residential \"burbclaves\" (quasi-sovereign gated communities). In this future, American institutions are far different from those in the actual United States at the time the book was published; for example, a for-profit organization, the CIC, has evolved from the CIA's merger with the Library of Congress.22\nSummary.\nHiro Protagonist is a freelance hacker, and pizza delivery driver for the Mafia. He meets Y.T. (short for Yours Truly), a young skateboard Kourier (courier), who refers to herself in the third person, during a failed attempt to make a delivery on time. Y.T. completes the delivery on his behalf, and they strike up a partnership, gathering intel and selling it to the CIC.\nWithin the \"Metaverse\", Hiro is offered a datafile named Snow Crash by a man named Raven, who hints that it is a form of narcotic. Hiro's friend and fellow hacker Da5id views a bitmap image contained in the file, which causes his computer to crash and Da5id to suffer brain damage in the real world. Hiro meets his ex-girlfriend Juanita Marquez, who gives him a database containing a large amount of research compiled by her associate, Lagos. This research posits connections between the virus, ancient Sumerian culture, and the legend of the Tower of Babel. Juanita advises him to be careful and disappears.\nThe Mafia boss Uncle Enzo begins to take a paternal interest in Y.T. Impressed by her attitude and initiative, he arranges to meet her and offers her freelance jobs. Hiro's investigations and Y.T.'s intelligence gathering begin to coincide, with links between the neuro-linguistic viruses, a religious organization known as Reverend Wayne's Pearly Gates and a media magnate named L.\u00a0Bob Rife beginning to emerge. Lagos's research showed that the ancient Sumerian ur-language allowed brain function to be \"programmed\" using audio stimuli in conjunction with a DNA-altering virus. Sumerian culture was organized around these programs (known as \"me\"), which priests administered to the populace. Enki, a figure of legend, developed a counter-virus (known as \"the nam-shub of Enki\"), which, when delivered, stopped the Sumerian language from being processed by the brain and led to the development of other, less literal languages, giving birth to the Babel myth. L.\u00a0Bob Rife had been collecting Sumerian artifacts and developed the drug Snow Crash to make the public vulnerable to new forms of \"me\", which he would control. The physical form of the virus is distributed in the form of an addictive drug and within Reverend Wayne's church via infected blood. There is also a digital version, to which hackers are especially vulnerable, as they are accustomed to processing information in binary form.\nHiro heads north to the Oregon Coast, where the Raft, a huge collection of boats containing Eurasian refugees, is approaching the West Coast of the United States. The center of the Raft is L.\u00a0Bob Rife's yacht, formerly the USS\u00a0\"Enterprise\" nuclear-powered aircraft carrier. Rife has been using the Raft as a mechanism to indoctrinate and infect thousands with the virus and to import it to America. Y.T. is captured and brought to Rife on the Raft, who intends to use her as a hostage, knowing her connection to Uncle Enzo. With help from the Mafia, Hiro fights his way onto the Raft and recovers the \"nam-shub\" of Enki, which Rife had been concealing. With help from Juanita, who had previously infiltrated the Raft, the \"nam-shub\" is read out, and Rife's control over the Raft is broken. Rife flees the Raft, taking Y.T., and his mercenary, Raven, attempts to activate the digital form of Snow Crash at a virtual concert within the Metaverse. Hiro is able to neutralize the virus, and Y.T. escapes. At Los Angeles International Airport, Raven ambushes the Mafia and fights Uncle Enzo to a stalemate (though both men are severely injured in the process), while Rife is killed as he attempts to flee the airport on his private jet. Y.T. is reunited with her mother, and Hiro and Juanita reconcile and agree to rekindle their relationship.\nBackground.\nStephenson originally planned \"Snow Crash\" as a computer-generated graphic novel in collaboration with artist Tony Sheeder. In the author's acknowledgments Stephenson recalls:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nIdeas and ideologies.\nThe books themes include history, linguistics, anthropology, archaeology, religion, computer science, politics, cryptography, memetics, and philosophy.\n\"Snow Crash\" takes place under anarcho-capitalism, a theme Stephenson carries over to his next novel \"The Diamond Age\". As described in both novels and the short story \"The Great Simoleon Caper\" (1995), hyperinflation has sapped the value of the US\u00a0dollar to the extent that trillion-dollar bills are nearly disregarded, and the quadrillion-dollar note is the standard \"small\" bill.241 This hyperinflation was created by the government overprinting money due to loss of tax revenue, as people increasingly began to use electronic currency, which they exchanged in untaxable encrypted online transactions. For physical transactions, most people resort to alternative currencies such as the yen or \"Kongbucks\" (the official currency of Mr.\u00a0Lee's Greater Hong Kong). Hyperinflation has also negatively affected much of the world, resulting in waves of desperate refugees from Asia who cross the Pacific in rickety ships hoping to arrive in North America.\nThe \"Metaverse\", a phrase coined by Stephenson as a successor to the Internet, constitutes Stephenson's early 1990s vision of how a virtual reality\u2013based Internet might evolve shortly. Resembling a massively multiplayer online game (MMO). The Metaverse is populated by user-controlled avatars, as well as system daemons. Although there are public-access Metaverse terminals in \"Reality\", using them carries a social stigma among Metaverse denizens, in part because of the poor visual representations of themselves as low-quality avatars. Status in the Metaverse is a function of two things: access to restricted areas such as the Black Sun, an exclusive Metaverse club, and the sophistication of one's avatar.\nCharacteristic technologies.\nVarious fictional technologies are employed in this world and help define it, including skateboards and motorcycles with adaptive \"Smartwheels\",28 cybernetic guard dogs known as \"Rat Things\",248 and a prototype portable railgun weapon named \"Reason\".361\nMetaverse.\nStephenson's \"Metaverse\" appears to its users as an urban environment, developed along a single hundred-meter-wide road, the Street, that runs around the entire 65,536\u00a0km (216\u00a0km) circumference of a featureless, black, perfectly spherical planet. The virtual real estate is owned by the Global Multimedia Protocol Group, a fictional part of the real life Association for Computing Machinery, and is available to be bought and buildings developed thereupon.24 Access to the metaverse is through L. Bob Rife's global fiber-optic network, which grew from a collection of small cable television franchises into a global telecommunications monopoly and superseded the traditional telephone system.115\nUsers of the Metaverse gain access to it through personal terminals that project a high-quality virtual reality display onto goggles worn by the user,23 or from low-quality public terminals in booths (with the penalty of presenting a grainy black-and-white appearance).41 Stephenson also describes a subculture of people choosing to remain continuously connected to the Metaverse by wearing portable terminals, goggles and other equipment; they are nicknamed \"gargoyles\" due to their grotesque appearance.123 The users of the Metaverse experience it from a first-person perspective.\nWithin the Metaverse, individual users appear as avatars of any form, with the sole restriction of height, \"to prevent people from walking around a mile high\".41 Transport within the Metaverse is limited to analogs of reality by foot or vehicle, such as the monorail that runs the entire length of the Street, stopping at 256 \"Express Ports\", located evenly at 256\u00a0km intervals, and \"Local Ports\", one kilometer apart.37\nDistributed republics.\nDistributed republics are loosely connected state-like entities dispersed across the world. The concept was reused by Stephenson in \"The Diamond Age\".\nLiterary significance and criticism.\n\"Snow Crash\" established Stephenson as a major science fiction writer of the 1990s. The book appeared on \"Time\" magazine's list of 100 all-time best English-language novels written since 1923. Some critics have considered it a parody of cyberpunk and mentioned its satiric or absurdist humor.\nIn his book \"The Shape of the Signifier: 1967 to the End of History\", Walter Benn Michaels targets Stephenson's view that \"languages are codes\" rather than a grouping of letters and sounds to be interpreted. Michaels contends that this basic idea of language as code is central to the construct of \"Snow Crash\" (\"... a good deal of \"Snow Crash\"'s plot depends upon eliding the distinction between hackers and their computers, as if\u2014indeed, in the novel, just because\u2014looking at code will do to the hacker what receiving it will do to the computer\"), but at the same time, trivializes the role of meaning in linguistic works.The body that is infected by a virus does not become infected because it understands the virus any more than the body that does not become infected misunderstands the virus. So a world in which everything\u2014from bitmaps to blood\u2014can be understood as a \"form of speech\" is also a world in which nothing actually is \"understood\", a world in which what a speech act does is disconnected from what it means.\nRorty's \"Achieving Our Country\" summarizes the content of \"Snow Crash\", using it as an example of modern culture that \"express the loss of what he [Rorty] calls 'national hope'... the problem with \"Snow Crash\" is not that it isn't true\u2014after all, it's a story\u2014but that it isn't inspirational\". This lack of inspiration is offset by something else \"Snow Crash\" and other works like it offer:These books produce in their readers the 'state of soul' that Rorty calls 'knowingness', which he glosses as a 'preference for knowledge over hope' (37)\"; this preference for knowledge \"contribute[s] to a more fundamental failure to appreciate the value of inspiration\u2014and hence of literature\u2014itself\".\nInfluence on the World Wide Web and computing.\n\"Habitat\", the 1986 virtual environment, applied the Sanskrit term \"avatar\" to online virtual bodies before Stephenson. However, the success of \"Snow Crash\" popularized the term to the extent that \"avatar\" is now a term for this concept in computer games and on the World Wide Web.\nThe novel's Central Intelligence Corporation\u2014the result of a merger between the Library of Congress and Central Intelligence Agency\u2014operates a wiki-like private knowledge base known as the Library. However, unlike Wikimedia, contributors to the Library (stringers) are paid if their contributions are used, making the Library more of an information marketplace than a public knowledge repository.\nMany virtual globe programs, including NASA World Wind and Google Earth, bear a resemblance to the \"Earth\" software developed by the CIC in \"Snow Crash\". One Google Earth co-founder claimed that Google Earth was modeled after \"Snow Crash\", while another co-founder said that it was inspired by \"Powers of Ten\". Stephenson later referenced this in another of his novels, \"Reamde\".\nStephenson's concept of the Metaverse has enjoyed continued popularity and influence in high-tech circles (especially Silicon Valley) ever since the publication of \"Snow Crash\". As a result, Stephenson has become \"a sought-after futurist\" and has worked as a futurist for Blue Origin and Magic Leap.\nSoftware developer Michael Abrash was inspired by \"Snow Crash\"'s Metaverse and its networked 3D world. He left Microsoft for Id Software to write something in that direction, the result being \"Quake\". The story for the 3DO game \"Immercenary\" was also heavily influenced by \"Snow Crash\". A direct video-game adaptation of \"Snow Crash\" was in development in 1996, but it was never released.\nThe online virtual worlds \"Active Worlds\" and \"Second Life\" were both directly inspired by the Metaverse in \"Snow Crash\".\nFormer Microsoft Chief Technology Officer J Allard and former Xbox Live Development Manager Boyd Multerer claimed to have been heavily inspired by \"Snow Crash\" in the development of Xbox Live, and that it was a mandatory read for the Xbox development team.\nPossible film or television adaptation.\nThe novel was optioned shortly after its publication and subsequent success, although to date, it has never progressed past pre-production. Canadian science fiction director Vincenzo Natali in particular has argued against a two-hour feature film adaptation because of a perceived lack of fit with the form; since the novel is \"tonally all over the place\", he feels that a mini-series would be a more suitable format for the material.\nIn late 1996, it was announced that writer-director Jeffrey Nachmanoff would adapt the novel for The Kennedy/Marshall Company and Touchstone Pictures. Marco Brambilla was attached to direct the film. In June 2012, it was announced that English director Joe Cornish, following his 2011 debut film \"Attack the Block\", had been signed as director of a future film adaptation for Paramount Pictures. In 2013, Stephenson described Cornish's script as \"amazing\", but also warned that there was no guarantee that a film would be made. In July 2016, producer Frank Marshall said that filming could start in 2017.\nIn August 2017, Amazon Studios announced that it was co-producing an hour-long science fiction drama television show based on \"Snow Crash\" with Paramount. The announcement stated that the television show would be executive produced by Cornish and the Kennedy/Marshall Company's Frank Marshall. In December 2019, it was announced that HBO Max had acquired the series with Paramount continuing to produce and Cornish remaining executive producer. HBO Max passed on the project in June 2021, and it reverted to Paramount and Kennedy/Marshall.\nInfluence.\nGoogle co-founder Sergey Brin called \"Snow Crash\" one of his favorite novels. One of the developers of Google Earth noted The Metaverse as an influence. The concept of the Metaverse also inspired the rebrand of Facebook to Meta Platforms Inc. in 2021, and spurred author Neal Stephenson himself to found a company in 2022 called Lamina1 to support the creation of virtual worlds using blockchain technology.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Montalb\u00e1n's career spanned seven decades, during which he became widely known for performances in genres from crime and drama to musicals and comedy. \nLater in his career, Montalb\u00e1n portrayed Armando in the \"Planet of the Apes\" film series from the early 1970s, starring in both \"Escape from the Planet of the Apes\" (1971) and \"Conquest of the Planet of the Apes\" (1972). As the villain Khan Noonien Singh, a genetically enhanced human, he guest-starred in the original ' television series (1967) and starred in the film ' (1982). \nDuring the 1970s and 1980s, Montalb\u00e1n was a spokesman for Chrysler for thirteen years, featured in their automotive commercials and advertisements, notably those in which he extolled the \"rich Corinthian leather\" used in the Cordoba's interior.\nMontalb\u00e1n played Mr. Roarke on the television series \"Fantasy Island\" (1977\u20131984). He won an Emmy Award for his role in the miniseries \"How the West Was Won\" (1978), and a Lifetime Achievement Award from the Screen Actors Guild in 1993. Montalb\u00e1n was professionally active into his eighties, providing voices for animated films and commercials, and appearing as Grandfather Valentin in the \"Spy Kids\" franchise.\nEarly life.\nMontalb\u00e1n was born on November 25, 1920, in Mexico City, and grew up in Torre\u00f3n, the son of Spanish immigrants Ricarda Merino Jim\u00e9nez and Genaro Balbino Montalb\u00e1n Busano, a store manager, who raised him as a Catholic. He was born with an arteriovenous malformation (AVM) in his spine. Montalb\u00e1n had a sister, Carmen, and two brothers, Pedro and Carlos. As a teenager, he moved to Los Angeles to live with Carlos. They moved to New York City in 1940, and Montalb\u00e1n earned a minor role in the play \"Her Cardboard Lover\".\nCareer.\nShort films.\nIn 1941, Montalb\u00e1n appeared in three-minute musicals produced for the Soundies film jukeboxes. He appeared in many of the New York\u2013produced Soundies as an extra or as a member of a singing chorus (usually billed as Men and Maids of Melody), although he had the lead role in \"He's a Latin from Staten Island\" (1941), in which he (billed simply as \"Ricardo\") played the title role of a guitar-strumming gigolo, accompanied by an offscreen vocal by Gus Van.\nMexican films.\nLater in 1941, Montalb\u00e1n returned to Mexico after learning that his mother was dying. There, he acted in a dozen Spanish-language films and became a star in his homeland.\nHe had an uncredited appearance in a version of \"The Three Musketeers\" (1942) starring Cantinflas. He can be glimpsed in \"El verdugo de Sevilla\" (1942), \"The Saint That Forged a Country\" (1942) starring Ramon Navarro, and \"La raz\u00f3n de la culpa\" (1943).\nStardom in Mexico.\nMontalb\u00e1n became a star in Mexico in \"Santa\" (1943), which was directed by a Hollywood expat, Norman Foster. He followed it with a support role in \"Cinco fueron escogidos\" (1943).\nFoster gave him a second lead role in \"The Escape\" (1944) aka \"La Fuga\". Montalban had the star role in \"Cadetes de la naval\", \"Nosotros\", and \"The Hour of Truth\" (all 1945), the latter a bullfighting drama also directed by Foster.\nMontalban was in \"The House of the Fox\" (1945), \"Pepita Jimenez\" (1946), and \"Fantas\u00eda ranchera\" (1947).\nMetro-Goldwyn-Mayer.\nMontalb\u00e1n's films had been seen by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer who were looking for someone to play a bullfighter opposite Esther Williams in \"Fiesta\" (1947), shot in Mexico. Montalb\u00e1n was cast and the movie was very popular; Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer signed him to a long-term contract.\nThe studio re-teamed him with Williams in \"On an Island with You\" (1948). He had a dance number in the Frank Sinatra musical \"The Kissing Bandit\" (1948), then did a third film with Williams, \"Neptune's Daughter\" (1949), in which they dueted on \"Baby It's Cold Outside\".\nMontalb\u00e1n's first leading role was in the film noir \"Border Incident\" (1949) with actor George Murphy, directed by Anthony Mann. It was one of a number of lower budgeted films made at the studio under Dore Schary and earned a small loss. Montalb\u00e1n was the first Hispanic actor to appear on the front cover of \"Life\" magazine on November 21, 1949. \"I was king for a week,\" he said later. \"I thought the offers would flood in, but after a week\u2014nothing.\"\nMontalban was one of several soldiers in the William Wellman war film \"Battleground\" (1949), a huge success at the box office. He was given another star role in \"Mystery Street\" (1950), playing a detective in a film noir directed by John Sturges. It was a box office disappointment.\nSturges also directed \"Right Cross\" (1950) with Montalb\u00e1n, Dick Powell and June Allyson. Montalb\u00e1n and Jane Powell made the musical \"Two Weeks with Love\" (1950), which was a minor hit.\nUniversal borrowed Montalb\u00e1n and Cyd Charisse for a swashbuckler, \"The Mark of the Renegade\" (1951). Back at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, he was second billed to Clark Gable in \"Across the Wide Missouri\" (1951), directed by Wellman. The film was a big hit, although Montalb\u00e1n was injured during shooting.\nThe studio teamed him and Shelley Winters in \"My Man and I\" (1952) where he played a laborer under the direction of Wellman; it didn't sell well at the box office.\nMontalb\u00e1n was one of several names in \"Sombrero\" (1953), shot in Mexico. Montalb\u00e1n was Lana Turner's leading man in \"Latin Lovers\" (1953). Both films lost money and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer let him go.\nHe later said, \"I played caricatures of what a Latin is supposed to be like. In reality, we are family men. I should have had the courage of Dolores Del Rio who returned to Mexico and made her best movies there.\"\nB movies, television, and Broadway.\nMontalb\u00e1n did a swashbuckler for Sam Katzman, \"The Saracen Blade\" (1954), then returned to Mexico to star in \"Untouched\" (1954).\nHe travelled to Italy to make \"The Queen of Babylon\" (1954) with Rhonda Fleming, then returned to Mexico to make the US-financed \"A Life in the Balance\" (1955) with Anne Bancroft. He bought a story for himself, \"Green Shadows\", but it appears not to have been made.\nMontalb\u00e1n began working in television, guest-starring on shows such as \"General Electric Theater\", \"The Ford Television Theatre\", \"Celebrity Playhouse\", \"Climax!\", \"The 20th Century-Fox Hour\" (versions of \"Broken Arrow\" and \"Five Fingers\"), \"Chevron Hall of Stars\", \"Wagon Train\", and \"Schlitz Playhouse\".\nIn 1955, he appeared on Broadway with Gloria DeHaven in a musical adaptation of \"Seventh Heaven,\" but it ran for only forty-four performances. In Hollywood, he appeared in the thriller for Allied Artists, \"Three for Jamie Dawn\" (1956).\nMontalb\u00e1n returned to Italy for \"Desert Warrior\" (1957), then had his first role in an \"A\" Hollywood film for a number of years in \"Sayonara\" (1957), in which he played a Japanese dancer. He later said, \"I was and still am very pleased with my performance and very much saddened by this picture. I was hoping for an Academy Award nomination, but unfortunately, most of my scenes ended up on the cutting-room floor.\"\nFrom 1957 to 1959, Montalb\u00e1n starred in the Broadway musical \"Jamaica\", singing several light-hearted calypso numbers opposite Lena Horne, which ran for 558 performances. His performance earned him a Tony Award nomination.\nMontalb\u00e1n continued to guest-star on shows such as \"Colgate Theatre\" and \"Playhouse 90\". When \"Jamaica\" ended, he guest-starred in \"Riverboat\", \"Adventures in Paradise\", \"Startime\", \"Death Valley Days\", \"Bonanza\", \"Alfred Hitchcock Presents\", \"The Christophers\", \"The Dinah Shore Chevy Show\", \"The Loretta Young Show\" (several times), \"Zorro\", \"The Untouchables\", \"Checkmate\", \"Cain's Hundred\", and \"The Lloyd Bridges Show\".\nMontalb\u00e1n could also be seen in \"Let No Man Write My Epitaph\" (1960); the TV remake of \"Rashomon\" (1960) directed by Sidney Lumet; \"Rage of the Buccaneers\" (1961), an Italian swashbuckler in which Montalb\u00e1n had a lead role alongside Vincent Price; \"Hemingway's Adventures of a Young Man\" (1962); \"The Reluctant Saint\" (1963) with Maximillian Schell; and \"Love is a Ball\" (1963) with Glenn Ford, playing a French duke. He was the Native American leader Little Wolf in \"Cheyenne Autumn\" (1964) directed by John Ford, did the TV version of \"The Fantasticks\" (1964), and returned to Mexico to make \"\u00a1Buenas noches, a\u00f1o nuevo!\" (1964).\nHe was mostly seen, though, on television in \"Alcoa Premiere\", \"The Dick Powell Theatre\", \"Ben Casey\", \"The Greatest Show on Earth\", \"The Lieutenant\", \"The Great Adventure\", \"Slattery's People\", \"The Defenders\", \"The Rogues\", \"Burke's Law\", \"Dr. Kildare\", and \"The Man from U.N.C.L.E.\"\nMontalb\u00e1n had supporting roles in \"The Money Trap\" (1965) with Ford, directed by Burt Kennedy, \"Madame X\" (1966) with Turner for producer Ross Hunter, and \"The Singing Nun\" (1966) with Debbie Reynolds at MGM.\nHe guest-starred in \"The Long, Hot Summer\", \"Daniel Boone\", \"The Wild Wild West\", \"Insight\", \"Combat!\", \"\", \"I Spy\", \"Hawaii Five-O\" (playing a Japanese-American crime boss ), and \"Bob Hope Presents the Chrysler Theatre\".\nIn 1965, he toured in \"The King and I\". \"'I think every actor loves the stage,' he said in 1991. 'The pros are that it is the actor's medium; there's no way your scene is going to end up on the cutting-room floor, and it's up to you to get and keep the attention of the audience by the truth of your performance.'\"\nHe appeared in the television films \"Alice Through the Looking Glass\" (1966) (for which his fee was $10,000, equivalent to $ today.) and ' (1967), and the features \"The Longest Hundred Miles\" (1967), \"Sol Madrid\" (1968), and \"Blue\" (1968). He also guest-starred on \"Space Seed\", an episode of '. \"I'm like a doctor on 24-hour call,\" he said in a 1967 interview. \"I don't turn anything down.\"\nMontalb\u00e1n also starred in radio, such as on the internationally syndicated program \"Lobo del Mar\" (\"Seawolf\"), in which he was cast as the captain of a vessel that became part of some adventure at each port it visited. This 30-minute weekly show aired in many Spanish-speaking countries until the early 1970s.\nTelevision movies.\nMontalb\u00e1n guest-starred in \"The Felony Squad\", \"Ironside\", \"It Takes a Thief\", and \"The High Chaparral\". He did the television films \"The Pigeon\" (1969), \"The Desperate Mission\" (1969) (playing Joaquin Murrieta), and \"Black Water Gold\" (1970), and had a supporting role in the big screen film version of \"Sweet Charity\" (1969).\nMontalb\u00e1n was in \"The Name of the Game\"; \"Gunsmoke\"; \"Dan August\"; \"Bracken's World\"; \"Marcus Welby, M.D.\"; \"The Virginian\"; \"The Doris Day Show\"; \"Sarge\"; and \"Nichols\". He did the television films \"The Aquarians\" (1970), \"The Face of Fear\" (1971), and \"Fireball Forward\" (1972) and the features \"The Deserter\" (1970), \"Escape from the Planet of the Apes\" (1971), \"Conquest of the Planet of the Apes\", and \"The Train Robbers\" (1973) (directed by Kennedy).\nMontalb\u00e1n continued to guest-star on shows like \"O'Hara, U.S. Treasury\"; \"Here's Lucy\"; and \"Griff\".\nIn 1972, Montalb\u00e1n co-founded the Screen Actors Guild Ethnic Minority Committee with actors Carmen Zapata, Henry Darrow and Edith Diaz. In 1973, he returned to Broadway for a revival of \"Don Juan in Hell\". He did the television films \"Wonder Woman\" (1974), \"The Mark of Zorro\" (1974), \"McNaughton's Daughter\" (1976), and guest-starred on \"Switch\" and \"Columbo\".\nIn 1975, he was chosen as the television spokesman for the new Chrysler Cordoba. The car became a successful model, and over the following several years, was heavily advertised; his mellifluous delivery of a line praising the \"soft\", \"fine\" or \"rich Corinthian leather\" upholstery of the car's interior became famous and was much parodied, and Montalb\u00e1n subsequently became a favorite subject of impersonators. For example, Eugene Levy frequently impersonated him on \"SCTV\", as did Dan Aykroyd on \"Saturday Night Live\". In 1986, he was featured in a magazine advertisement for the new Chrysler New Yorker.\nMontalb\u00e1n is in ' (1976), and \"Joe Panther\" (1976) and had a regular role in a short lived series \"Executive Suite\" (1976). He guest-starred on \"Police Story\" and did the television films ' (1977), \"Captains Courageous\" (1977), as well as the miniseries \"How the West Was Won\" (1978).\n\"Fantasy Island\" and \"Star Trek II\".\nMontalb\u00e1n's best-known television role was that of Mr. Roarke on the television series \"Fantasy Island\", which he played from 1977 until 1984. For a while, the series was one of the most popular on television, and his character as well as that of his sidekick, Tattoo (played by Herv\u00e9 Villechaize), became popular icons.\nAnother of his well-known roles was that of Khan Noonien Singh in ' (1982), in which he reprised a role that he had originated in the episode of ' titled \"Space Seed\" (1967). Early rumors suggested Montalb\u00e1n wore prosthetic muscles on his chest during filming of \"Star Trek II\" to appear more muscular. Director Nicholas Meyer replied that even in his sixties, Montalb\u00e1n, who had a vigorous training regimen, was \"one strong cookie\", and that his real chest was seen on film. Khan's costume was specifically designed to display Montalb\u00e1n's physique. \nHis performance as Khan was widely praised. Critic Christopher Null called Khan the \"greatest role of Montalb\u00e1n's career\". \"New Yorker\" critic Pauline Kael said Montalb\u00e1n's performance as Khan \"was the only validation he has ever had of his power to command the big screen\". Roger Ebert of \"The Chicago Sun-Times\" wrote how this type of film was \"only as good as its villain\" and Montalb\u00e1n's decision to avoid overacting and instead play the character as motivated by \"deeply wounded pride\" inspired a measure of sympathy in the audience. \nMontalb\u00e1n agreed to take the role for a significant pay cut, since by his own admission, he relished reprising the role, and his only regret was that he and William Shatner never interacted \u2013 the characters never meet face to face, except through video communication \u2013 for their scenes were filmed several months apart to accommodate Montalb\u00e1n's schedule for \"Fantasy Island\". When, much later, Montalb\u00e1n guest-starred in the \"Family Guy\" episode \"McStroke\" as a genetically engineered cow, his character made several references to his role as Khan, and similar references were made in his role as Armando Guitierrez on the animated series \"Freakazoid!\". After a cameo in \"Cannonball Run II\" (1984), Montalb\u00e1n had a guest role in \"Dynasty\" which led to a regular role in its spin-off \"The Colbys\".\nMontalb\u00e1n played the villain in \"\" (1988) and guest-starred in \"B.L. Stryker\"; \"Murder, She Wrote\"; \"Hearts Are Wild\"; and \"The Golden Palace\".\nInjury and later career.\nDuring the filming of \"Across the Wide Missouri\" (1951), Montalb\u00e1n was thrown from his horse, knocked unconscious, and trampled by another horse, which aggravated his arteriovenous malformation and resulted in a traumatic back injury that never healed. The pain increased as he aged, and in 1993, he underwent over nine hours of spinal surgery that left his body below the waist impaired and requiring the use of mobility aids.\nDespite constant pain, he continued to perform, providing voices for animated films and supporting his Nosotros Foundation. Filmmaker Robert Rodriguez created the role of Valentin Avellan in the \"Spy Kids\" film series specifically for Montalb\u00e1n.\nHe had another regular series with \"Heaven Help Us\" (1994), but it only lasted 14 episodes.\nIn 1997, Montalb\u00e1n sued the producers of \"Fantasy Island\" claiming he was entitled to five percent of the profits. The producers claimed the show had lost $11 million. The matter settled out of court.\nMontalb\u00e1n also narrated several historical documentaries including the Spanish version of the National Park Service's history of Pecos Pueblo for Pecos National Historical Park.\nAt one point during the development of the Disney animated film \"Lilo &amp; Stitch\" (2002), Montalb\u00e1n recorded voice lines for an alien member of a gang led by Stitch, then made to be an adult, naturally-born alien gang leader, using his performance as Khan in \"Star Trek II\" as basis. After a story meeting in which the film's gang elements were entirely cut due to being perceived as superfluous to the plot, Montalb\u00e1n's character was removed.\nMontalb\u00e1n had a supporting role in ' (2002) and ' (2003).\nPrior to his death in January 2009, Montalb\u00e1n recorded the voice for a guest character in an episode of the animated series \"American Dad!\", in which main character Roger becomes the dictator of a South American country. According to executive producer Mike Barker, it was his last role after \"The Ant Bully\".\nNosotros Foundation and Montalb\u00e1n Theatre.\nThe way he was asked to portray Mexicans disturbed him, so Montalb\u00e1n, along with Richard Hernandez, Val de Vargas, Rodolfo Hoyos Jr., Carlos Rivas, Tony de Marco, and Henry Darrow, established the Nosotros (\"We\") Foundation in 1970 to advocate for Latinos in the movie and television industries. He served as its first president, and was quoted as saying: \"I received tremendous support, but there also were some negative repercussions. I was accused of being a militant, and as a result I lost jobs.\" Ironically, the Nosotros Foundation and he were instrumental in taking roles away from Nico Minardos, a Greek-American actor who in the 1970s often played Latino roles because of his appearance and accent. Minardos similarly became outspoken, and according to his agent and others, it cost him a recurring role as a Mexican mayor in an episode of \"Alias Smith and Jones\".\nThe foundation created the Golden Eagle Awards, an annual awards show highlighting Latino actors. The awards are presented in conjunction with the Nosotros American Latino Film Festival, held at the Ricardo Montalb\u00e1n Theatre in Hollywood.\nThe Nosotros Foundation and the Ricardo Montalb\u00e1n Foundation agreed to purchase the Doolittle Theatre in 1999 from UCLA. The theater had been owned by Howard Hughes in the early 1930s, then later was renamed the Huntington Hartford Theater when purchased in 1954 by philanthropist Huntington Hartford, then later the Doolittle Theater. The process from agreement to opening took over four years. The facility in Hollywood was officially renamed the Ricardo Montalb\u00e1n Theatre in a May 11, 2004, ceremony. The event was attended by numerous celebrities, including Ed Begley Jr. representing the Screen Actors Guild, Valerie Harper, Loni Anderson, Hector Elizondo, and Robert Goulet.\nWhen Montalb\u00e1n rolled onto the stage in his wheelchair, he repeated \"the five stages of the actor\" (originally coined by Jack Elam to describe the course of his own career). Montalb\u00e1n had become famous for using the self-deprecating joke in interviews and in public speeches:\nHe then jokingly added two more stages: \nMontalb\u00e1n spoke about the goal of the Nosotros organization:&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Mexico is my mother; the United States the best friend I will ever have. And so I dream of the day when my mother will say, 'Ricardo, you have chosen a wonderful friend.' And the day when the friend will say, 'Ricardo, you have a sensational mother.' That is why it is very important to bring us together. Brothers and sisters, love thy neighbor as thyself. And this theatre, I think, can be a little grain of sand towards that end. Here we have opened the doors not only for the opportunity of young talent to develop\u2014writers, directors, actors\u2014but also in coming together as a group in this society in which we live. Let's open a hand of friendship and love and brotherhood. That is my dream. I'll never see it complete while I'm still alive, but I think this is the beginning, and that is what makes me so happy to see this come to fruition.\nPersonal life.\nAfter seeing Georgiana Young in \"The Story of Alexander Graham Bell\" (1939), then-18-year-old Montalb\u00e1n became enamored of the 15-year-old Young\u00a0\u2013 half-sister of actresses Sally Blane, Polly Ann Young, and Loretta Young. Montalb\u00e1n had started his own stage and film career by the time the two met on a blind date; Montalb\u00e1n proposed that evening, later stating \"It took a week to persuade her.\" They married in 1944, and had four children together: Laura, Mark, Anita and Victor. After 63 years of marriage, Young died in 2007, at age 83.\nMontalb\u00e1n was a practicing Catholic, once proclaiming that his religion was the most important thing in his life. He was a member of the Good Shepherd Parish and the Catholic Motion Picture Guild in Beverly Hills, California. In 1998, Pope John Paul II made him a Knight of the Order of St. Gregory the Great (KSG), the highest honor a Catholic lay person can receive from the church. In 1986, in honor of the 100th anniversary of the Statue of Liberty, he recorded a public service announcement celebrating the United States' generosity and hospitality to him as a foreign-born actor.\nHis autobiography \"Reflections: A Life in Two Worlds\" was published in January 1980 by Doubleday.\nFor many years, Montalb\u00e1n followed a strict diet and physical training regimen, giving him an enviable physique. After the release of \"The Wrath of Khan\", director Nicholas Meyer was quick to quell rumors of Montalb\u00e1n using prosthetics during filming.\nIn 2005, Montalb\u00e1n was due to receive an honorary doctorate from the University of New Mexico, but due to circumstances was unable to attend the ceremony. On May 13, 2023, Montalb\u00e1n was posthumously awarded an honorary Doctorate of Humane Letters from UNM, which was received by his granddaughter Lydia Martinez. \nDeath.\nOn January 14, 2009, Montalb\u00e1n died at his home in Los Angeles at the age of 88. According to his son-in-law, Gilbert Smith, he died of \"complications from advancing age\". The precise cause of death was revealed to be congestive heart failure. He is buried in the Holy Cross Cemetery in Culver City, California.\nIn popular culture.\nAndy Garc\u00eda portrays Ricardo Montalb\u00e1n in the 2018 film \"My Dinner with Herv\u00e9\", which is based on the life of Montalb\u00e1n's \"Fantasy Island\" co-star Herv\u00e9 Villechaize.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Postpartum infection, also known as puerperal fever or childbed fever, consists of any bacterial infection of the reproductive tract following birth and in the 19th century was common and often fatal. Semmelweis demonstrated that the incidence of infection could be drastically reduced by requiring healthcare workers in obstetrical clinics to disinfect their hands. In 1847, he proposed hand washing with chlorinated lime solutions at Vienna General Hospital's First Obstetrical Clinic, where doctors' wards had thrice the mortality of midwives' wards. The maternal mortality rate dropped from 18% to less than 2%, and he published a book of his findings, \"Etiology, Concept and Prophylaxis of Childbed Fever\", in 1861.\nDespite his research, Semmelweis's observations conflicted with the established scientific and medical opinions of the time and his ideas were rejected by the medical community. He could offer no theoretical explanation for his findings of reduced mortality due to hand-washing, and some doctors were offended at the suggestion that they should wash their hands and mocked him for it. In 1865, the increasingly outspoken Semmelweis allegedly suffered a nervous breakdown and was committed to an asylum by his colleagues. In the asylum, he was beaten by the guards. He died 14 days later from a gangrenous wound on his right hand that may have been caused by the beating.\nHis findings earned widespread acceptance only years after his death, when Louis Pasteur confirmed the germ theory of disease, giving Semmelweis' observations a theoretical and scientific explanation, and Joseph Lister, acting on Pasteur's research, practised and operated using hygienic methods with great success.\nFamily and early life.\nIgnaz Semmelweis was born on 1 July 1818 in the Tab\u00e1n neighbourhood of Buda, Kingdom of Hungary, Austrian Empire. He was the fifth child out of 10 of the prosperous grocer family of J\u00f3zsef Semmelweis and Ter\u00e9z M\u00fcller.\nOf German ancestry, his father was an ethnic German born in Kismarton, in the Kingdom of Hungary (now Eisenstadt, Austria), and his mother an ethnic German from Buda. J\u00f3zsef Semmelweis was granted citizenship in Buda in 1806 and, in the same year, he opened a wholesale business for spices and general consumer goods. The company was named \"Zum wei\u00dfen Elefanten\" (At the White Elephant) in the Meindl House (today's Semmelweis Museum of Medical History, located at 1\u20133 Apr\u00f3d Street, Budapest). By 1810, he was a wealthy man and married Ter\u00e9z M\u00fcller, daughter of the coachbuilder F\u00fcl\u00f6p M\u00fcller.\nIgnaz began studying law at the University of Vienna in the autumn of 1837, but switched to medicine. He was awarded his doctor of medicine degree in 1844. After failing to obtain an appointment in a clinic for internal medicine, Semmelweis specialized in obstetrics. His teachers included Carl von Rokitansky, Joseph \u0160koda, and Ferdinand von Hebra.\nWork on cause of child bed fever mortality.\nPosition at Vienna General Hospital.\nSemmelweis was appointed assistant to Professor Johann Klein in the First Obstetrical Clinic of the Vienna General Hospital on 1 July 1846.\nThere were two maternity clinics at the Viennese hospital. The First Clinic had an average maternal mortality rate of about 10% due to puerperal fever. The Second Clinic's rate averaged less than 4%. Women begged to be admitted to the Second Clinic, due to the reputation of the First Clinic. Semmelweis described desperate women begging on their knees not to be admitted to the First Clinic.\nWomen began purposefully giving birth in the streets, pretending to have given birth \"en route\" to the hospital so they could avoid being admitted to the clinic where the risk of infection, birth complications and death were substantially higher. \nSemmelweis was puzzled that puerperal fever was rare among women giving street births, prompting his curiosity as to what protected those who delivered outside the clinic.\nAnalysis of childbed fever mortality.\nTroubled by the mortality discrepancy between the two clinics, Semmelweis searched for differences. He excluded overcrowding as a cause since the Second Clinic was always more crowded. He eliminated climate because the two clinics were in close geographical proximity to each other. He altered the position in which mothers gave birth, and proposed that the giving of last rites by priests in the clinic was terrifying women after birth, causing them to develop the fever.\nTheory of cadaverous poisoning.\nSemmelweis' breakthrough occurred in 1847, following the death of his good friend Jakob Kolletschka, who had been accidentally poked with a student's scalpel while performing a \"post mortem\" examination. Kolletschka's autopsy showed a pathology similar to that of the women who were dying from puerperal fever. Semmelweis immediately proposed a connection between cadaveric contamination and puerperal fever.\nHe proposed that he and the medical students carried \"cadaverous particles\" on their hands from the autopsy room to the patients they examined in the First Obstetrical Clinic. This explained why the student midwives in the Second Clinic, who were not engaged in autopsies and had no contact with corpses, saw a much lower mortality rate.\nThe germ theory of disease had not yet been accepted in Vienna. Thus, Semmelweis concluded some unknown \"cadaverous material\" caused childbed fever. He instituted a policy of using a solution of chlorinated lime (calcium hypochlorite) for washing hands between autopsy work and the examination of patients. He did this because he found that this chlorinated solution worked best to remove the putrid smell of infected autopsy tissue, and thus perhaps destroyed the causal \"poisonous\" or contaminating \"cadaveric\" agent hypothetically being transmitted by this material. The result was the mortality rate in the First Clinic declined 90% and was then comparable to that in the Second Clinic. The mortality rate in April 1847, before the new hand washing procedures were instituted, was 18.3%. The new procedures started in mid-May leading to lower rates: June 2.2%, July 1.2%, and August 1.9%. In two months in the year following this discovery, for the first time since the introduction of anatomical orientation, the death rate was zero.\nEfforts to reduce childbed fever.\nSemmelweis's hypothesis, that there was only one cause, that the primary factor was cleanliness, was extreme at the time and was largely ignored, rejected, or ridiculed. He was dismissed from the hospital for political reasons and harassed by the medical community in Vienna, being eventually forced to move to Budapest.\nSemmelweis was outraged by the indifference of the medical profession and began writing open and increasingly angry letters to prominent European obstetricians, at times denouncing them as irresponsible murderers. His contemporaries, including his wife, presumed he was losing his mind, and in 1865, nearly 20 years after his breakthrough, he was committed to the \"Landesirrenanstalt D\u00f6bling\" (provincial lunatic asylum). He died there of septic shock only 14 days later, possibly as the result of being severely beaten by guards. Semmelweis's practice earned widespread acceptance only years after his death when Louis Pasteur further developed the germ theory of disease, offering a theoretical explanation for Semmelweis's findings. He is considered a pioneer of antiseptic procedures.\nConflict with established medical opinion.\nSemmelweis's observations conflicted with the established scientific and medical opinions of the time. The theory of diseases was highly influenced by ideas of an imbalance of the basic \"four humours\" in the body, a theory known as dyscrasia, for which the main treatment was bloodlettings. Medical texts at the time emphasized that each case of disease was unique, the result of a personal imbalance, and the main difficulty of the medical profession was to establish precisely each patient's unique situation, case by case.\nThe findings from autopsies of deceased women also showed a confusing multitude of physical signs, which emphasized the assumption that puerperal fever was not one, but many different, yet unidentified, diseases.\nAlso, some historians of science argue that resistance to path-breaking contributions of obscure scientists is common and \"constitutes the single most formidable block to scientific advances\".\nAs a result, his ideas were rejected by the medical community. Other, subtler factors may also have played a role. Some doctors, for instance, were offended at the suggestion that they should wash their hands, feeling that their social status as gentlemen was inconsistent with the idea that their hands could be unclean.\nSemmelweis's results lacked scientific explanation at the time. That became possible only in the 1860s and 1870s, when Louis Pasteur, Joseph Lister, Robert Koch, and others further developed the germ theory of disease.\nDuring 1848, Semmelweis widened the scope of his washing protocol, to include all instruments coming in contact with patients in labour, and used mortality rates time series to document his success in virtually eliminating puerperal fever from the hospital ward.\nHesitant publication of results and first signs of trouble.\nToward the end of 1847, accounts of the work of Semmelweis (as well as the similar conclusions of Oliver Wendell Holmes Sr., working in the United States of America) began to spread around Europe. Semmelweis and his students wrote letters to the directors of several prominent maternity clinics describing their recent observations. Ferdinand von Hebra, the editor of a leading Austrian medical journal, announced Semmelweis's discovery in the December 1847 and April 1848 issues of the medical journal. Hebra claimed that Semmelweis's work had a practical significance comparable to that of Edward Jenner's introduction of cowpox inoculations to prevent smallpox.\nIn late 1848, one of Semmelweis's former students wrote a lecture explaining Semmelweis's work. The lecture was presented before the Royal Medical and Surgical Society in London and a review published in \"The Lancet\", a prominent medical journal. A few months later, another of Semmelweis's former students published a similar essay in a French periodical.\nAs accounts of the dramatic reduction in mortality rates in Vienna were being circulated throughout Europe, Semmelweis had reason to expect that the chlorine washings would be widely adopted, saving tens of thousands of lives. Early responses to his work also gave clear signs of coming trouble, however. Some physicians had clearly misinterpreted his claims. Additionally, initial responses to Semmelweis's findings tended to downplay their significance by arguing that \"he had said nothing new\". James Young Simpson, for instance, saw no difference between Semmelweis's groundbreaking findings and the idea presented in an 1843 paper by Oliver Wendell Holmes Sr. that childbed fever was contagious (\"i.e\". that infected persons could pass the infection to others).\nIn fact, Semmelweis was warning against all decaying organic matter, not just against a specific contagion that originated from victims of childbed fever themselves. This misunderstanding, and others like it, occurred partly because Semmelweis's work was known only through secondhand reports written by his colleagues and students. At this crucial stage, Semmelweis himself had published nothing. These and similar misinterpretations continued to cloud discussions of his work throughout the century.\nSome accounts emphasize that Semmelweis neither wished to communicate his method officially to the learned circles of Vienna, nor was eager to explain it on paper.\nPolitical turmoil and dismissal from the Vienna hospital.\nIn 1848, a series of tumultuous revolutions swept across Europe. The resulting political turmoil would affect Semmelweis's career. In Vienna on 13 March 1848, students demonstrated in favor of increased civil rights, including trial by jury and freedom of expression. The demonstrations were led by medical students and young faculty members and were joined by workers from the suburbs. Two days later in Hungary, demonstrations and uprisings led to the Hungarian Revolution of 1848 and a full-scale war against the ruling Habsburgs of the Austrian Empire. In Vienna, the March demonstration was followed by months of general unrest.\nNo evidence indicates Semmelweis was personally involved in the events of 1848. Some of his brothers were punished for active participation in the Hungarian independence movement, and the Hungarian-born Semmelweis likely was sympathetic to the cause. Semmelweis's superior, professor Johann Klein, was a conservative Austrian, likely uneasy with the independence movements and alarmed by the other revolutions of 1848 in the Habsburg areas. Klein probably mistrusted Semmelweis.\nWhen Semmelweis's term was about to expire, Carl Braun also applied for the position of \"assistant\" in the First Clinic, possibly at Klein's own invitation. Semmelweis and Braun were the only two applicants for the post. Semmelweis's predecessor, Franz Breit, had been granted a two-year extension. Semmelweis's application for an extension was supported by Joseph \u0160koda and Carl von Rokitansky and by most of the medical faculty, but Klein chose Braun for the position. Semmelweis was obliged to leave the obstetrical clinic when his term expired on 20 March 1849.\nThe day his term expired, Semmelweis petitioned the Viennese authorities to be made docent of obstetrics. A docent was a private lecturer who taught students and who had access to some university facilities. At first, because of Klein's opposition, Semmelweis's petition was denied. He reapplied, but had to wait until 10 October 1850 (more than 18 months), before finally being appointed docent of 'theoretical' obstetrics. The terms refused him access to cadavers and limited him to teaching students by using leather-fabricated mannequins only. A few days after being notified of his appointment, Semmelweis left Vienna abruptly and returned to Pest. He apparently left without so much as saying goodbye to his former friends and colleagues, a move that might have offended them. According to his own account, he left Vienna because he was \"unable to endure further frustrations in dealing with the Viennese medical establishment\".\nLife in Budapest.\nDuring 1848\u20131849, some 70,000 troops from the Habsburg-ruled Austrian Empire thwarted the Hungarian independence movement, executed or imprisoned its leaders and in the process destroyed parts of Pest. Semmelweis, upon arriving from the Habsburg Vienna in 1850, likely was not warmly welcomed in Pest.\nOn 20 May 1851, Semmelweis took the relatively insignificant, unpaid, honorary head-physician position of the obstetric ward of Pest's small Szent R\u00f3kus Hospital. He held that position for six years, until June 1857. Childbed fever was rampant at the clinic; at a visit in 1850, just after returning to Pest, Semmelweis found one fresh corpse, another patient in severe agony, and four others seriously ill with the disease. After taking over in 1851, Semmelweis virtually eliminated the disease. During 1851\u20131855, only eight patients died from childbed fever out of 933 births (0.85%).\nDespite the impressive results, Semmelweis's ideas were not accepted by the other obstetricians in Budapest. The professor of obstetrics at the University of Pest, Ede Fl\u00f3ri\u00e1n Birly, never adopted Semmelweis's methods, continuing to believe that puerperal fever was due to uncleanliness of the bowel; therefore, extensive purging was the preferred treatment.\nAfter Birly died in 1854, Semmelweis applied for the position. So did Carl Braun\u2014Semmelweis's nemesis and successor as Johann Klein's assistant in Vienna\u2014and Braun received more votes from his Hungarian colleagues than Semmelweis did. Semmelweis was eventually appointed in 1855, but only because the Viennese authorities overruled the wishes of the Hungarians, as Braun did not speak Hungarian. As professor of obstetrics, Semmelweis instituted chlorine washings at the University of Pest maternity clinic. Once again, the results were impressive.\nSemmelweis declined an offer in 1857 to become professor of obstetrics at the University of Zurich. The same year, Semmelweis married M\u00e1ria Weidenhofer (1837\u20131910), 19 years his junior and the daughter of a successful merchant in Pest. They had five children.\nResponse by the medical community.\nSemmelweis's views were much more favorably received in the United Kingdom than on the continent, but he was more often cited than understood. The British consistently regarded Semmelweis as having supported their theory of contagion. A typical example was W. Tyler Smith, who claimed that Semmelweis \"made out very conclusively\" that \"miasms derived from the dissecting room will excite puerperal disease.\" One of the first to respond to Semmelweis's 1848 communications was James Young Simpson, who wrote a stinging letter. Simpson surmised that the British obstetrical literature must be totally unknown in Vienna, or Semmelweis would have known that the British had long regarded childbed fever as contagious and would have employed chlorine washing to protect against it.\nIn 1856, Semmelweis's assistant Josef Fleischer reported the successful results of hand washing activities at St. Rochus and Pest maternity institutions in the\" Viennese Medical Weekly \"(\"Wiener Medizinische Wochenschrift\"). The editor remarked sarcastically that it was time people stopped being misled about the theory of chlorine washings. Two years later, Semmelweis published his own account of his work in an essay entitled \"The Etiology of Childbed Fever\". Two years after that, he published a second essay, \"The Difference in Opinion between Myself and the English Physicians regarding Childbed Fever\". In 1861, Semmelweis published his main work \"Die \u00c4tiologie, der Begriff und die Prophylaxis des Kindbettfiebers\" (German for \"The Etiology, Concept and Prophylaxis of Childbed Fever\"). In his 1861 book, Semmelweis lamented the slow adoption of his ideas: \"Most medical lecture halls continue to resound with lectures on epidemic childbed fever and with discourses against my theories. [...] In published medical works my teachings are either ignored or attacked. The medical faculty at W\u00fcrzburg awarded a prize to a monograph written in 1859 in which my teachings were rejected\".\nIn a textbook, Carl Braun, Semmelweis's successor as assistant in the first clinic, identified 30 causes of childbed fever; only the 28th of these was cadaverous infection. Other supposed causes included conception and pregnancy, uremia, pressure exerted on adjacent organs by the shrinking uterus, emotional traumata, mistakes in diet, chilling, and atmospheric epidemic influences.\nDespite this opposition, Braun, who was Assistant in the First Division in the period April 1849 to summer 1853, maintained a relatively low mortality rate in the First Division, roughly consistent with the rate Semmelweis himself achieved, as mortality rates in the period April 1849 to end 1853 show. These results suggest that Braun continued, assiduously, to require the chlorine washings.\nAt a conference of German physicians and natural scientists, most of the speakers rejected his doctrine, including the celebrated Rudolf Virchow, who was a scientist of the highest authority of his time. Virchow's great authority in medical circles contributed potently to Semmelweis' lack of recognition. Besides the persistent rejection (explained further-above) by his predecessor, the professor of obstetrics Ede Fl\u00f3ri\u00e1n Birly, August Breisky, an obstetrician in Prague, dismissed Semmelweis's book as na\u00efve and referred to it as \"the Koran of puerperal theology\". Breisky objected that Semmelweis had not proved that puerperal fever and pyemia are identical, and he insisted that other factors beyond decaying organic matter certainly had to be included in the etiology of the disease. Carl Edvard Marius Levy, head of the Copenhagen maternity hospital and an outspoken critic of Semmelweis's ideas, had reservations concerning the unspecific nature of cadaverous particles and that the supposed quantities were unreasonably small. In fact, Robert Koch later used precisely this fact to prove that various infecting materials contained living organisms which could reproduce in the human body; that is, since the poison could be neither chemical nor physical in operation, it must be biological.\nIt has been contended that Semmelweis could have had an even greater impact if he had managed to communicate his findings more effectively and avoid antagonising the medical establishment, even given the opposition from entrenched viewpoints.\nBreakdown and death.\nAfter a number of unfavorable foreign reviews of his 1861 book, Semmelweis lashed out against his critics in a series of open letters. They were addressed to various prominent European obstetricians, including Sp\u00e4th, Scanzoni, Siebold, and to \"all obstetricians\". They were \"highly polemical and superlatively offensive\", at times denouncing his critics as irresponsible murderers or ignoramuses. He also called upon Siebold to arrange a meeting of German obstetricians somewhere in Germany to provide a forum for discussions on puerperal fever, where he would stay \"until all have been converted to his theory.\"\nIn mid-1865, his public behaviour became exasperating and embarrassing to his associates. He also began to drink immoderately; he spent progressively more time away from his family, sometimes in the company of a prostitute; and his wife noticed changes in his sexual behavior. On 13 July 1865, the Semmelweis family visited friends, and during the visit, Semmelweis's behavior seemed particularly inappropriate.\nSemmelweis's alleged affliction has been a subject of some debate. According to K. Codell Carter, in his biography of Semmelweis, its exact nature cannot be determined:It is impossible to appraise the nature of Semmelweis's disorder. ... It might have been Alzheimer's disease, a type of dementia, which is associated with rapid cognitive decline and mood changes. It might have been third-stage syphilis, a then-common disease of obstetricians who examined thousands of women at gratis institutions, or it might have been emotional exhaustion from overwork and stress.In 1865, J\u00e1nos Balassa wrote a document referring Semmelweis to a mental institution. On 30 July, Ferdinand Ritter von Hebra lured him, under the pretense of visiting one of Hebra's \"new Institutes\", to a Viennese insane asylum located in Lazarettgasse (\"Landes-Irren-Anstalt in der Lazarettgasse\"). Semmelweis surmised what was happening and tried to leave. He was severely beaten by several guards, secured in a straitjacket, and confined to a darkened cell. Apart from the straitjacket, treatments at the mental institution included dousing with cold water and administering castor oil, a laxative. He died after two weeks, on 13 August 1865, aged 47, from a gangrenous wound, due to an infection on his right hand which might have been caused by the struggle. The autopsy gave the cause of death as pyemia (blood poisoning).\nSemmelweis was buried in Vienna on 15 August 1865. Only a few people attended the service. Brief announcements of his death appeared in a few medical periodicals in Vienna and Budapest. Although the rules of the Hungarian Association of Physicians and Natural Scientists specified that a commemorative address be delivered in honor of a member who had died in the preceding year, there was no address for Semmelweis; his death was never even mentioned.\nJ\u00e1nos Diescher was appointed Semmelweis's successor at the Pest University maternity clinic. Immediately, mortality rates increased sixfold to 6%, but the physicians of Budapest said nothing; there were no inquiries and no protests. Almost no one \u2014 either in Vienna or in Budapest \u2014 seemed to have been willing to acknowledge Semmelweis's life and work.\nHis remains were transferred to Budapest in 1891. On 11 October 1964, they were transferred once more to the house in which he was born. The house at 1-3 Apr\u00f3d utca is now a museum of medical history, honoring Ignaz Semmelweis.\nLegacy.\nSemmelweis' advice on chlorine washings was probably more influential than he realized. Many doctors, particularly in Germany, appeared quite willing to experiment with the practical hand washing measures that he proposed\u2014although virtually everyone rejected his basic and ground-breaking innovation: that the disease had only one cause, lack of cleanliness. Gustav Adolf Michaelis, a professor at a maternity institution in Kiel, replied positively to Semmelweis' suggestions, but eventually committed suicide, feeling responsible for the death of his own cousin, whom he had examined after she gave birth.\nOnly belatedly did his observational evidence gain wide acceptance. More than twenty years later, Louis Pasteur's work on the germ theory of disease offered a \"theoretical\" explanation for Semmelweis' observations. Consequently, the Semmelweis story is often used in university courses with epistemology content, e.g. philosophy of science courses\u2014to support fringe philosophies regarding scientific information, supposedly providing a historical account of which types of knowledge count as scientific (and thus accepted) knowledge, and which do not. C. Hempel, just to mention one, dedicated the first pages of his \"Philosophy of Natural Science\" to Semmelweis, arguing that the latter's method is typical of contemporary scientific research, in that the doctor framed a series of hypotheses, verifying them through falsifying experiments in accordance with Hempel's deductive-nomological model. It has been seen as an irony that Semmelweis' critics considered themselves positivists, but the rejection of his work demonstrated the flaws of positivism in the face of theories which seem magical or superstitious, such as the idea that \"corpse particles\" might turn a person into a corpse, with no causal mechanism being stipulated, after a simple contact. To his contemporaries, Semmelweis seemed to be reverting to the speculative theories of earlier decades that were so repugnant to his positivist contemporaries.\nBecause his ideas were ridiculed and rejected by his contemporaries, a cognitive bias called the Semmelweis reflex has been established, which describes a trait of human behaviour characterized by an automatic rejection of new knowledge because it contradicts entrenched norms, assumptions, or paradigms.\nOther legacies of Semmelweis include:\nFootnotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nWorks cited.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;"}

Mindelo is also the seat of the parish of Nossa Senhora da Luz, and the municipality of S\u00e3o Vicente. The city is home to 93% of the entire island's population and is Cape Verde's second most populous city and largest city in Barlavento Islands. Mindelo is also considered the cultural capital of Cape Verde, known for its colourful and animated carnival celebrations, with roots in Portuguese traditions later influenced by the Brazilian culture.\nHistory.\nA settlement at Mindelo was founded in 1793 by the Portuguese. It was initially named \"Nossa Senhora da Luz\", renamed \"Leopoldina\" around 1820 after the Queen consort. In 1838 it was renamed \"Mindelo\" after the 1832 Landing at Mindelo, north of Porto. It became a coal deposit for ships of the British East India Company in 1838, followed by the Royal Mail Steam Packet Company in 1850. The settlement became a town (\"vila\") in 1858, and had 1,400 inhabitants then. It became a city (\"cidade\") in 1879, and had 3,717 inhabitants then. In 1884 a submarine communications cable was laid between Europe, Africa, India and North America, making Mindelo an important communications centre for the British Empire.\nFrom the beginning of the 20th century the port of Mindelo lost its importance for transatlantic navigation. Causes for this were the shift from coal to oil as fuel for ships, the rise of competing ports like Dakar and the Canary Islands and the lack of investment in port infrastructure. Between 1910 and 1940 there were several strikes in Mindelo, and on 7 June 1934 there were riots in the streets of Mindelo, caused by unemployment and poverty. One man was killed; several were injured.\nBetween 1940 and 1958 three prolonged periods of severe drought, combined with soil erosion and overgrazing, brought famine in Cape Verde. In the whole archipelago, about 45,000 people died and 20,000 people emigrated. Mindelo attracted immigrants, notably from nearby Santo Ant\u00e3o, and continued to grow.\nMindelo was the cultural capital of the Portuguese-speaking world from November 2002 until November 2003. \nGeography.\nMindelo is situated at the Porto Grande Bay, a large natural harbour. The town is surrounded by low mountains: the Monte Cara and the Morro Branco headland to the west, and the Monte Verde to the east. The town is crossed by the river Ribeira de Juli\u00e3o.\nThe Ces\u00e1ria \u00c9vora Airport lies southwest of Mindelo, near the village S\u00e3o Pedro. Ferries for Santo Ant\u00e3o leave from the port.\nSubdivisions.\nThe city is divided into the following localities for statistical reasons:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nClimate.\nMindelo city has a desert climate (K\u00f6ppen: \"BWh\"). The average annual temperature is . It is very dry with only around annual precipitation.\nEconomy.\nIts economy consists mainly of business, fishing, shipping, boating and more commonly tourism which developed more recently. Mindelo has several hotels, restaurants and tourist agencies.\nCityscape.\nThe main streets of Mindelo are Avenida Marginal along the waterfront, and the perpendicular Rua Libertadores de \u00c1frica (former \"Rua Lisboa\"). Many colonial buildings from the 19th and early 20th century have been preserved in the city centre. Sites of interest include:\nInternational relations.\nMindelo has been twinned with the following cities:\nDemography.\nAt the 2010 census, Mindelo had 70,468 inhabitants.

It is located between the islands of Santo Ant\u00e3o and Santa Luzia, with the Canal de S\u00e3o Vicente separating it from Santo Ant\u00e3o.\nGeography.\nThe island is roughly rectangular in shape with an area of . From east to west it measures and from north to south . The island, of volcanic origin, is fairly flat. The last volcanic activity is considered to have taken place in the Pleistocene. Although very eroded, some craters still remain, for instance Viana. Its highest point is Monte Verde, located in the eastern part with an altitude of . Other mountains include Madeiral (680 m), Caixa (535 m) and Monte Cara (490 m).\n92.6% of the island population lives in the urban area of Mindelo, on the Porto Grande Bay, a caldera that is breached by the ocean. A small islet, Ilh\u00e9u dos P\u00e1ssaros, is less than one nautical mile off the coast of Porto Grande Bay. There are a few intermittent streams, including Ribeira do Calhau and Ribeira de Juli\u00e3o.\nClimate.\nS\u00e3o Vicente has a hot desert climate (K\u00f6ppen \"BWh\"). The average annual temperature in Mindelo is . The island is very dry with only annual precipitation in Mindelo. Only the higher area of Monte Verde receives more precipitation.\nHistory.\nS\u00e3o Vicente was discovered by the Portuguese explorer Diogo Afonso on 22 January 1462 (Saint Vincent's Day). Due to its lack of water, the island was initially used only as a cattle pasture. When the Municipality of Santo Ant\u00e3o was established in 1732, the island of S\u00e3o Vicente was part of it. At that time, it did not have permanent inhabitants. In 1793 the area of Porto Grande Bay was settled. It was only in 1838, when a coal depot was established at Porto Grande Bay to supply ships on Atlantic routes, that the population started to grow rapidly. From the beginning of the 20th century the port of Mindelo lost its importance for transatlantic navigation. Causes for this were the shift from coal to oil as fuel for ships, the rise of competing ports like Dakar and the Canary Islands and the lack of investment in port infrastructure.\nMunicipality.\nAdministratively, the island of S\u00e3o Vicente is covered by one municipality, \"Concelho de S\u00e3o Vicente\". This municipality consists of one \"freguesia\" (civil parish), \"Nossa Senhora da Luz\", which also covers the whole island. The municipal seat is the city of Mindelo.\nThe \"freguesia\" is subdivided into the following settlements:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nPolitics.\nSince 2004, the Movement for Democracy (MpD) is the ruling party of the municipality. The results of the latest elections, in 2016:\nPopulation.\nIn the 1830s, S\u00e3o Vicente had an estimated population of 356. The population of S\u00e3o Vicente in the 2010 census was 76,140, making it the second most populous island of Cape Verde after Santiago. The annual population growth is 1.3%. 92.6% of the population live in urban areas, which is the highest proportion of all islands (average for Cape Verde: 61.8%). Life expectancy is 76 years, higher than some other parts of the world. The birth rate is 2.7% and infant mortality rate is 18 per 1000 live births (for comparison 103 in DR Congo, 55 in India, 27 in Turkey, 23 in Brazil, 16 in Russia, 4 in Finland).\nThe majority of the population is young; 49% of the population is under the age of 25, and 7.4% of the population is over the age of 65. The island has 19,923 households, of which there are an average of 3.8 persons per household, lower than Cape Verde's level of 4.2 persons per household. In 2010 15.1% of the households owned an automobile (Cape Verde: 12.7%).\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Bar chart/styles.css\"/&gt;\nEconomy.\nThe economy of the island was always based almost exclusively on commerce and services. Due to lack of rain, agriculture is at a subsistence level. Fishing has some relevance, but conditions prevent it from being more important, not only for the catch\u2014lobster\u2014but also for the associated industries: conserves, drying and salting of fish, and naval construction.\nPorto Grande is the main port of Cape Verde, through which passes much of the country's imports. It has a terminal of containers, silos, and refrigeration units that make handling load overflow possible. There is also a modern seawater desalination plant, which provides water for public consumption and for naval shipyards.\nIn the industrial sector, the island presents an abundance of manpower, even though unskilled, resulting from the exodus of inhabitants of other islands to S\u00e3o Vicente. About 27% of the employed population is unskilled. Highly qualified employees\u2014company executives, public administrators, and managers and directors\u2014make up less than 2% of employees. It is distinguished, however, by a bigger participation of women in decision-making positions than the national average.\nAccording to the 2010 census, the island of S\u00e3o Vicente has the largest unemployment rate of the country\u201414.8%\u2014while the national average is 10.7%. Unemployment affects women more than men. The industrial park of the island\u2014the Industrial Zone of the Lazareto\u2014concentrates diverse types of manufacturing, essentially due to foreign investment, in the activities of footwear, confections, and fish processing.\nThe National Center of Workmanship of Mindelo supports local craftsmen in the production and commercialization of ceramic parts, articles made of coconut rinds, and necklaces of shells and rocks.\nMany sports are practised in S\u00e3o Vicente, and many have spread to the remaining islands. The island is suitable for windsurfing; the beach of S\u00e3o Pedro is considered one of the best for windsurfing, as shown by the many world-class champions of the sport. Cycling, walking trails and horseback riding are ways to explore the island. S\u00e3o Vicente has an excellent 18-hole golf course. For these reasons, tourism has excellent growth potential on S\u00e3o Vicente and in the rest of the Cape Verde archipelago. Travel between the diverse localities of the island is provided by a system of public transportation operated by five private companies: Transcor.SA, Morabeza Transport, Transport Joy, Friendship, Sotral and Automindelo. However, especially for places farthest from the city of the Mindelo, namely Ba\u00eda das Gatas, Calhau, and S\u00e3o Pedro, van and bus leasing are the usual forms of transportation.\nEducation.\nThe literacy rate is 85%, and 98.9% among Cape Verdean youth. 54% of the island's population (those aged between 1 and 12 years old) receive education. Here are the schools and classrooms in S\u00e3o Vicente:\nEducational institutions.\nThe island has 35 primary schools, many of which are in Mindelo, there are other schools in Calhau, Salamansa and S\u00e3o Pedro.\nThere are five state schools, attended by 8,350 pupils during the 2004\u201305 school season:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nPrivate schools.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nPost-secondary education.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nOther institutions and observatories.\nOther academic and research institutions include the INDP Instituto Nacional de Desenvolvimento das Pescas and with it the Cape Verde Ocean Observatory CVOO. It also has the CVAO, the https://, associated with the University of York (UK), IFT Leipzig (Germany), Max Planck, Jena (Germany) and the Cape Verdean meteorological institute (INMG).\nLanguage.\nOther than Portuguese, which is the primary language, Cape Verdean Creole is spoken by the majority of the population. The S\u00e3o Vicente variant is known as \"Crioulo de S\u00e3o Vicente\" (in Portuguese) or \"Kriol d Sonsent\" (in Creole).\nLiterature\nNotable people.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nTransportation.\nThe island is served by the international Ces\u00e1ria \u00c9vora Airport near S\u00e3o Pedro, in the southwestern part of the island. The port of Mindelo, Porto Grande, is the busiest port of Cape Verde, with ferry services to the islands of Santo Ant\u00e3o, S\u00e3o Nicolau, Santiago and Sal. There is one first class national road on the island: from the airport to Mindelo. Furthermore, there are two second class and five third class national roads.\nMindelo has a network of buses that connects the majority of the suburbs with the city center. Most of the lines are operated by Transcor SV SA.\nCulture.\nWhen the port was thriving in the late 19th century, in the early 20th century, it was the mainstream of culture in Cape Verde alongside Santiago. Several works, books and poems in the mid 20th century were related to the rise of nationalism and the independence struggle for the country, notably the review \"Claridade\". It is the birthplace of coladeira music. Also a variant of morna is popular.\nSports.\nThe island has its own football league named the S\u00e3o Vicente Island League. There are also competitions for basketball, volleyball, futsal and athletics. There is a golf course about south of Mindelo.\nTwin towns and sister cities.\nThe municipality of S\u00e3o Vicente is twinned with the following municipalities in Portugal:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He is also known as D\u014dgen Kigen (), Eihei D\u014dgen (), K\u014dso J\u014dy\u014d Daishi (), and Bussh\u014d Dent\u014d Kokushi ().\nOriginally ordained as a monk in the Tendai School in Kyoto, he was ultimately dissatisfied with its teaching and traveled to China to seek out what he believed to be a more authentic Buddhism. He remained there for four years, finally training under Ti\u0101nt\u00f3ng R\u00faj\u00ecng, an eminent teacher of the C\u00e1od\u00f2ng lineage of Chinese Chan. Upon his return to Japan, he began promoting the practice of zazen (sitting meditation) through literary works such as \"Fukanzazengi\" and \"Bend\u014dwa\".\nHe eventually broke relations completely with the powerful Tendai School, and, after several years of likely friction between himself and the establishment, left Kyoto for the mountainous countryside where he founded the monastery Eihei-ji, which remains the head temple of the S\u014dt\u014d school today.\nD\u014dgen is known for his extensive writings like the \"Sh\u014db\u014dgenz\u014d\" (\"Treasury of the True Dharma Eye\", considered his magnum opus), the \"Eihei K\u014droku\" (\"Extensive Record,\" a collection of his talks), the \"Eihei Shingi\" (the first Japanese Zen monastic code), along with his Japanese poetry, and commentaries. D\u014dgen's writings are one of the most important sources studied in the contemporary S\u014dt\u014d Zen tradition.\nBiography.\nEarly life.\nD\u014dgen was probably born into a noble family, though as an illegitimate child of Minamoto Michichika. His foster father was his older brother Minamoto no Michitomo, who served in the imperial court as a high-ranking . His mother, named Ishi, the daughter of Matsudono Motofusa and a sister of the monk Ry\u014dkan H\u014dgen, is said to have died when D\u014dgen was age 7.\nEarly training.\nIn 1212, the spring of his thirteenth year, D\u014dgen fled the house of his uncle Matsudono Moroie and went to his uncle Ry\u014dkan H\u014dgen at the foot of Mount Hiei, the headquarters of the Tendai school of Buddhism. Stating that his mother's death was the reason he wanted to become a monk, Ry\u014dkan sent the young D\u014dgen to Jien, an abbot at Yokawa on Mount Hiei. According to the \"Kenzeiki\" (), he became possessed by a single question with regard to the Tendai doctrine:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;As I study both the exoteric and the esoteric schools of Buddhism, they maintain that human beings are endowed with Dharma-nature by birth. If this is the case, why did the Buddhas of all ages \u2014 undoubtedly in possession of enlightenment \u2014 find it necessary to seek enlightenment and engage in spiritual practice?\nThis question was, in large part, prompted by the Tendai concept of original enlightenment ( \"hongaku\"), which states that all human beings are enlightened by nature and that, consequently, any notion of achieving enlightenment through practice is fundamentally flawed.\nThe \"Kenzeiki\" further states that he found no answer to his question at Mount Hiei, and that he was disillusioned by the internal politics and need for social prominence for advancement. Therefore, D\u014dgen left to seek an answer from other Buddhist masters. He went to visit K\u014din, the Tendai abbot of Onj\u014d-ji Temple (), asking him this same question. K\u014din said that, in order to find an answer, he might want to consider studying Ch\u00e1n in China. In 1217, two years after the death of contemporary Zen Buddhist My\u014dan Eisai, D\u014dgen went to study at Kennin-ji Temple (), under Eisai's successor, My\u014dzen ().\nTravel to China.\nIn 1223, D\u014dgen and My\u014dzen undertook the dangerous passage across the East China Sea to China (Song dynasty) to study in Jing-de-si (Ching-te-ssu, ) monastery as Eisai had once done. Around the time the Mongol Empire was waging wars on the various dynasties of China.\nIn China, D\u014dgen first went to the leading Chan monasteries in Zh\u00e8ji\u0101ng province. At the time, most Chan teachers based their training around the use of \"g\u014dng-\u00e0n\" (Japanese: \"k\u014dan\"). Though D\u014dgen assiduously studied the k\u014dans, he became disenchanted with the heavy emphasis laid upon them, and wondered why the sutras were not studied more. At one point, owing to this disenchantment, D\u014dgen even refused Dharma transmission from a teacher. Then, in 1225, he decided to visit a master named R\u00faj\u00ecng (; J. Nyoj\u014d), the thirteenth patriarch of the C\u00e1od\u00f2ng (J. S\u014dt\u014d) lineage of Zen Buddhism, at Mount Ti\u0101nt\u00f3ng's ( \"Ti\u0101nt\u00f3ngsh\u0101n\"; J. Tend\u014dzan) Ti\u0101nt\u00f3ng temple in N\u00edngb\u014d. Rujing was reputed to have a style of Chan that was different from the other masters whom D\u014dgen had thus far encountered. In later writings, D\u014dgen referred to Rujing as \"the Old Buddha\". Additionally he affectionately described both Rujing and My\u014dzen as .\nUnder Rujing, D\u014dgen realized liberation of body and mind upon hearing the master say, \"cast off body and mind\" ( \"sh\u0113n x\u012bn tu\u014d lu\u00f2\"). This phrase would continue to have great importance to D\u014dgen throughout his life, and can be found scattered throughout his writings, as\u2014for example\u2014in a famous section of his \"Genj\u014dk\u014dan\" ():\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;To study the Way is to study the Self. To study the Self is to forget the self. To forget the self is to be enlightened by all things of the universe. To be enlightened by all things of the universe is to cast off the body and mind of the self as well as those of others. Even the traces of enlightenment are wiped out, and life with traceless enlightenment goes on forever and ever.\nMy\u014dzen died shortly after D\u014dgen arrived at Mount Tiantong. In 1227, D\u014dgen received Dharma transmission and \"inka\" from Rujing, and remarked on how he had finally settled his \"life's quest of the great matter\".\nReturn to Japan.\nD\u014dgen returned to Japan in 1227 or 1228, going back to stay at Kennin-ji, where he had trained previously. Among his first actions upon returning was to write down the \"Fukanzazengi\" (; \"Universally Recommended Instructions for Zazen\"), a short text emphasizing the importance of and giving instructions for \"zazen\" (sitting meditation).\nHowever, tension soon arose as the Tendai community began taking steps to suppress both Zen and J\u014ddo Shinsh\u016b, the new forms of Buddhism in Japan. In the face of this tension, D\u014dgen left the Tendai dominion of Ky\u014dto in 1230, settling instead in an abandoned temple in what is today the city of Uji, south of Ky\u014dto.\nIn 1233, D\u014dgen founded the Kannon-d\u014dri-in in Fukakusa as a small center of practice. He later expanded this temple into K\u014dsh\u014dh\u014drin-ji ().\nEihei-ji.\nIn 1243, Hatano Yoshishige () offered to relocate D\u014dgen's community to Echizen province, far to the north of Ky\u014dto. D\u014dgen accepted this offer to relocate, because of the ongoing tension with the Tendai community, and the growing competition of the Rinzai-school\nHis followers built a comprehensive center of practice there, calling it Daibutsu Temple (Daibutsu-ji, ). While the construction work was going on, D\u014dgen would live and teach at Yoshimine-dera Temple (Kipp\u014d-ji, ), which is located close to Daibutsu-ji. During his stay at Kipp\u014d-ji, D\u014dgen \"fell into a depression\". It marked a turning point in his life, giving way to \"rigorous critique of Rinzai Zen\". He criticized Dahui Zonggao, the most influential figure of Song dynasty Ch\u00e1n.\nIn 1246, D\u014dgen renamed Daibutsu-ji, calling it Eihei-ji. This temple remains one of the two head temples of S\u014dt\u014d Zen in Japan today, the other being S\u014dji-ji.\nD\u014dgen spent the remainder of his life teaching and writing at Eihei-ji. In 1247, the newly installed sh\u014dgun's regent, H\u014dj\u014d Tokiyori, invited D\u014dgen to come to Kamakura to teach him. D\u014dgen made the rather long journey east to provide the sh\u014dgun with lay ordination, and then returned to Eihei-ji in 1248. In the autumn of 1252, D\u014dgen fell ill, and soon showed no signs of recovering. He presented his robes to his main apprentice, Koun Ej\u014d (), making him the abbot of Eihei-ji.\nDeath.\nAt Hatano Yoshishige's invitation, D\u014dgen left for Ky\u014dto in search of a remedy for his illness. In 1253, soon after arriving in Ky\u014dto, D\u014dgen died. Shortly before his death, he had written a death poem:\n&lt;poem&gt;Fifty-four years lighting up the sky.\nA quivering leap smashes a billion worlds.\nHah!\nEntire body looks for nothing.\nLiving, I plunge into Yellow Springs.&lt;/poem&gt;\nTeachings.\nZazen.\nD\u014dgen often stressed the critical importance of zazen, or sitting meditation as the central practice of Buddhism. He considered zazen to be identical to studying Zen. This is pointed out clearly in the first sentence of the 1243 instruction manual \"Zazen-gi\" (; \"Principles of Zazen\"): \"Studying Zen ... is zazen\". D\u014dgen taught zazen to everyone, even for the laity, male or female and including all social classes. In referring to zazen, D\u014dgen is most often referring specifically to \"shikantaza\", roughly translatable as \"nothing but precisely sitting\", or \"just sitting,\" which is a kind of sitting meditation in which the meditator sits \"in a state of brightly alert attention that is free of thoughts, directed to no object, and attached to no particular content\". In his \"Fukan Zazengi\", D\u014dgen wrote:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;For zazen, a quiet room is suitable. Eat and drink moderately. Cast aside all involvements and cease all affairs. Do not think good or bad. Do not administer pros and cons. Cease all the movements of the conscious mind, the gauging of all thoughts and views. Have no designs on becoming a Buddha. Zazen has nothing whatever to do with sitting or lying down.\nD\u014dgen also described zazen practice with the term \"hishiry\u014d\" (, \"non-thinking\", \"without thinking\", \"beyond thinking\"). According to Cleary, it refers to \"ek\u014d hensh\u014d\", turning the light around, focussing awareness on awareness itself. It is a state of no-mind which one is simply aware of things as they are, beyond thinking and not-thinking - the active effort not to think. In the \"Fukanzazengi\", D\u014dgen writes:...settle into a steady, immobile sitting position. Think of not thinking (\"fushiry\u014d\"). How do you think of not-thinking? Without thinking (\"hishiry\u014d\"). This in itself is the essential art of zazen. The zazen I speak of is not learning meditation. It is simply the Dharma-gate of repose and bliss, the cultivation-authentication of totally culminated enlightenment. It is the presence of things as they are.Masanobu Takahashi writes that \"hishiry\u014d\" is not a state of no mental activity whatsoever. Instead, it is a state \"beyond thinking and not-thinking\" and beyond affirmation and rejection. Other Japanese Dogen scholars link the term with the realization of emptiness. According to Thomas Kasulis, non-thinking refers to the \"pure presence of things as they are\", \"without affirming nor negating\", without accepting nor rejecting, without believing nor disbelieving. In short, it is a non-conceptual, non-intentional and \"prereflective mode of consciousness\" which does not imply that it is an experience without content. Similarly, Hee-Jin Kim describes this as an \"objectless, subjectless, formless, goalless and purposeless\" state which is yet not a blank void. As such, the correct mental attitude for zazen according to D\u014dgen is one of effortless non-striving, this is because for D\u014dgen, original enlightenment is already always present.\nOther Buddhist practices.\nWhile D\u014dgen emphasized the importance and centrality of zazen, he did not reject other traditional Buddhist practices, and his monasteries performed various traditional ritual practices. D\u014dgen's monasteries also followed a strict monastic code based on the Chinese Chan codes and D\u014dgen often quotes these and various Vinaya texts in his works. As such, monastic rules and decorum (saho) was an important element of D\u014dgen's teaching. One of the most important texts by D\u014dgen on this topic is the \"Pure Standards for the Zen Community\" (\"Eihei Shingi\").\nD\u014dgen certainly saw zazen as the most important Zen practice, and saw other practices as secondary. He frequently relegates other Buddhist practices to a lesser status, as he writes in the \"Bend\u014dwa\": \"Commitment to Zen is casting off body and mind. You have no need for incense offerings, homage praying, nembutsu, penance disciplines, or silent sutra readings; just sit single-mindedly.\" While D\u014dgen rhetorically critiques traditional practices in some passages, Foulk writes that \"D\u014dgen did not mean to reject literally any of those standard Buddhist training methods\". Rather, for D\u014dgen, one should engage in all practices without attachment and from the point of view of the emptiness of all things. It is from this perspective that D\u014dgen writes we should not engage in any \"practice\" (which is merely a conventional category which separates one kind of activity from another).\nIndeed, according to Foulk:the specific rituals that seem to be disavowed in the \"Bendowa\" passage are all prescribed for Zen monks, often in great detail, in Dogen's other writings. In \"Kuyo shobutsu\", Dogen recommends the practice of offering incense and making worshipful prostrations before Buddha images and stupas, as prescribed in the sutras and Vinaya texts. In \"Raihai tokuzui\" he urges trainees to revere enlightened teachers and to make offerings and prostrations to them, describing this as a practice which helps pave the way to one's own awakening. In \"Chiji shingi\" he stipulates that the vegetable garden manager in a monastery should participate together with the main body of monks in sutra chanting services (fugin), recitation services (nenju) in which buddhas' names are chanted (a form of nenbutsu practice), and other major ceremonies, and that he should burn incense and make prostrations (shoko raihai) and recite the buddhas' names in prayer morning and evening when at work in the garden. The practice of repentences (sange) is encouraged in Dogen's \"Kesa kudoku\", in his \"Sanji go\", and his \"Keisei sanshiki\". Finally, in \"Kankin\", Dogen gives detailed directions for sutra reading services (kankin) in which, as he explains, texts could be read either silently or aloud as a means of producing merit to be dedicated to any number of ends, including the satisfaction of wishes made by lay donors, or prayers on behalf of the emperor. \nOneness of practice-verification.\nThe primary concept underlying D\u014dgen's Zen practice is \"the oneness of practice-verification\" or \"the unity of cultivation and confirmation\" ( \"shush\u014d-itt\u014d\" / \"shush\u014d-ichinyo\"). The term \"sh\u014d\" (, verification, affirmation, confirmation, attainment) is also sometimes translated as \"enlightenment\", though this translation is also questioned by some scholars.\nThe \"shush\u014d-itt\u014d\" teaching was first and most famously explained in the \"Bend\u014dwa\" ( \"A Talk on the Endeavor of the Path\", c. 1231) as follows:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;To think that practice and verification are not one is the view of infidels. In the buddha-dharma, practice and verification are the same [shush\u014d kore itto nari]. Because it is practice based on verification, the beginner's pursuit of the way is the whole substance of original verification. Therefore, in giving instruction on what to be careful of in the practice, we teach not to expect verification outside of practice, for [the practice] is itself original verification. Since it is the verification of practice, verification has no limit; since it is the practice of verification, practice has no beginning.\nIn the \"Fukanzazengi\" (\"Universal Recommendation for Zazen\"), D\u014dgen explains how to practice zazen and then explains the nature of verification If you grasp the point of this [practice], the four elements [of the body] will become light and at ease, the spirit will be fresh and sharp, thoughts will be correct and clear; the flavor of the dharma will sustain the spirit, and you will be calm, pure, and joyful. Your daily life will be [the expression of] your true natural state. Once you achieve clarification [of the truth], you may be likened to the dragon gaining the water or the tiger taking to the mountains. You should realize that when right thought is present, dullness and agitation cannot intrude. \nBuddha-nature.\nFor D\u014dgen, buddha-nature or \"bussh\u014d\" () is all of reality, \"all things\" (). In the \"Sh\u014db\u014dgenz\u014d\", D\u014dgen writes that \"whole-being is the Buddha-nature\" and that even inanimate objects (rocks, sand, water) are an expression of Buddha-nature. He rejected any view that saw buddha-nature as a permanent, substantial inner self or ground. D\u014dgen describes buddha-nature as \"vast emptiness\", \"the world of becoming\" and writes that \"impermanence is in itself Buddha-nature\". He writes in \"Bussh\u014d\",\nTherefore, the very impermanency of grass and tree, thicket and forest is the Buddha nature. The very impermanency of men and things, body and mind, is the Buddha nature. Nature and lands, mountains and rivers, are impermanent because they are the Buddha nature. Supreme and complete enlightenment, because it is impermanent, is the Buddha nature.Takashi James Kodera writes that the main source of D\u014dgen's understanding of buddha-nature is a passage from the \"Nirvana sutra\" which was widely understood as stating that all sentient beings possess buddha-nature. However, D\u014dgen interpreted the passage differently, rendering it as follows: All are () sentient beings, () all things are () the Buddha-nature (); the Tathagata () abides constantly (), is non-existent () yet existent (), and is change (). Kodera explains that \"whereas in the conventional reading the Buddha-nature is understood as a permanent essence inherent in all sentient beings, D\u014dgen contends that all things are the Buddha-nature. In the former reading, the Buddha-nature is a change less potential, but in the latter, it is the eternally arising and perishing actuality of all things in the world.\"\nThus for D\u014dgen buddha-nature includes everything, the totality of \"all things\", including inanimate objects like grass, trees and land (which are also \"mind\" for D\u014dgen).\nGreat realization / satori.\nD\u014dgen taught that through zazen one could attain \"great realization\" or \"great enlightenment\" ( \"daigo-tettei\"), which is also called satori (, \"understanding\", \"knowledge\").\nAccording to Ko'un Yamada, D\u014dgen \"repeatedly emphasizes the importance of each person attaining enlightenment\". D\u014dgen writes about this in a fascicle of the \"Sh\u014db\u014dgenz\u014d\" titled \"Daigo\", which states that when practitioners of Zen attain daigo they have risen above the discrimination between delusion and enlightenment.\nWhile D\u014dgen did teach the importance of attaining enlightenment, he also critiqued certain ways of explaining it and teaching about it. According to Barbara O'Brien, D\u014dgen critiqued the term \"kensh\u014d\" because \"the word \"kensh\u014d\" means 'to see one's nature', which sets up a dichotomy between the seer and the object of seeing.\" Furthermore, according to Bielefeldt, D\u014dgen's zazen is \"a subtle state beyond either thinking or not thinking\" in which \"body and mind have been sloughed off\". It is a state in which \"all striving for religious experience, all expectation of satori (daigo), is left behind.\" As such, while D\u014dgen did not reject the importance of satori, he taught that we should not sit zazen with the goal of satori in mind.\nTime-Being.\nD\u014dgen's conception of Being-Time or Time-Being (\"Uji\", ) is an essential element of his metaphysics in the \"Sh\u014db\u014dgenz\u014d\". According to the traditional interpretation, \"Uji\" here means time itself is being, and all being is time.\" \"Uji\" is all the changing and dynamic activities that exist as the flow of becoming, all beings in the entire world are time. The two terms are thus spoken of concurrently to emphasize that the things are not to be viewed as separate concepts. Moreover, the aim is to not abstract time and being as rational concepts. This view has been developed by scholars such as Steven Heine, Joan Stambaugh and others and has served as a motivation to compare D\u014dgen's work to that of Martin Heidegger's \"Dasein\". Rein Raud has argued that this view is not correct and that D\u014dgen asserts that all existence is momentary, showing that such a reading would make quite a few of the rather cryptic passages in the \"Sh\u014db\u014dgenz\u014d\" quite lucid.\nPerfect expression.\nAnother essential element of D\u014dgen's 'performative' metaphysics is his conception of Perfect expression (\"D\u014dtoku\", ). \"While a radically critical view on language as soteriologically inefficient, if not positively harmful, is what Zen Buddhism is famous for,\" it can be argued \"'within the framework of a rational theory of language, against an obscurantist interpretation of Zen that time and again invokes experience.'\" D\u014dgen distinguishes two types of language: monji , the first, \u2013 after Ernst Cassirer \u2013 \"discursive type that constantly structures our experiences and\u2014more fundamentally\u2014in fact produces the world we experience in the first place\"; and d\u014dtoku , the second, \"presentative type, which takes a holistic stance and establishes the totality of significations through a texture of relations.\". As D\u00f6ll points out, \"It is this second type, as M\u00fcller holds, that allows for a positive view of language even from the radically skeptical perspective of D\u014dgen\u2019s brand of Zen Buddhism.\"\nCritique of Rinzai.\nD\u014dgen was sometimes critical of the Rinzai school for their formulaic and intellectual koan practice (such as the practice of the \"Shiryoken\" or \"Four Discernments\") as well as for their disregard for the sutras:\nRecently in the great Sung dynasty of China there are many who call themselves \"Zen masters\". They do not know the length and breadth of the Buddha-Dharma. They have heard and seen but little. They memorize two or three sayings of Lin Chi and Yun Men and think this is the whole way of the Buddha-Dharma. If the Dharma of the Buddha could be condensed in two or three sayings of Lin Chi and Yun Men, it would not have been transmitted to the present day. One can hardly say that Lin Chi and Yun Men are the Venerable ones of the Buddha-Dharma.\nD\u014dgen was also very critical of the Japanese Daruma school of Dainichi N\u014dnin.\nVirtues.\nDogen's perspective of virtue is discussed in the \"Sh\u014db\u014dgenz\u014d\" text as something to be practiced inwardly so that it will manifest itself on the outside. In other words, virtue is something that is both internal and external in the sense that one can practice internal good dispositions and also the expression of these good dispositions.\nWritings.\nWhile it was customary for Buddhist works to be written in Chinese, D\u014dgen often wrote in Japanese, conveying the essence of his thought in a style that was at once concise, compelling, and inspiring. A master stylist, D\u014dgen is noted not only for his prose, but also for his poetry (in Japanese \"waka\" style and various Chinese styles). D\u014dgen's use of language is unconventional by any measure. According to D\u014dgen scholar Steven Heine: \"Dogen's poetic and philosophical works are characterized by a continual effort to express the inexpressible by perfecting imperfectable speech through the creative use of wordplay, neologism, and lyricism, as well as the recasting of traditional expressions\".\nSh\u014db\u014dgenz\u014d.\nD\u014dgen's masterpiece is the \"Sh\u014db\u014dgenz\u014d\" (, \"Treasury of the True Dharma Eye\"), talks and writings collected together in ninety-five fascicles. The topics range from zazen, koans, Buddhist philosophy, monastic practice, the equality of women and men, to the philosophy of language, being, and time.\nShush\u014d-gi.\nThe \"Sh\u014db\u014dgenz\u014d\" served as the basis for the short work entitled \"Shush\u014d-gi\" (), which was compiled in 1890 by a layman named Ouchi Seiran (1845\u20131918) along with Takiya Takush\u016b () of Eihei-ji and Azegami Baisen () of S\u014dji-ji. The compilation serves as an introductory compilation of key extracts from the \"Sh\u014db\u014dgenz\u014d\" which help explain the foundational teachings and concepts of D\u014dgen Zen to a lay audience.\nShinji Sh\u014db\u014dgenz\u014d.\nD\u014dgen also compiled a collection of 301 koans in Chinese without commentaries added. Often called the \"Shinji Sh\u014db\u014dgenz\u014d\" (\"shinji\": \"original or true characters\" and \"sh\u014db\u014dgenz\u014d\", variously translated as \"the right-dharma-eye treasury\" or \"Treasury of the Eye of the True Dharma\"). The collection is also known as the \"Sh\u014db\u014dgenz\u014d Sanbyakusoku\" (The Three Hundred Verse Sh\u014db\u014dgenz\u014d\") and the \"Mana Sh\u014db\u014dgenz\u014d\", where \"mana\" is an alternative reading of \"shinji\". The exact date the book was written is in dispute but Nishijima believes that Dogen may well have begun compiling the koan collection before his trip to China.\nAlthough these stories are commonly referred to as \"k\u014dans\", D\u014dgen referred to them as \"kosoku\" (ancestral criteria) or \"innen\" (circumstances and causes or results, of a story). The word \"k\u014dan\" for Dogen meant \"absolute reality\" or the \"universal Dharma\".\nCollections of dharma discourses.\nLectures that D\u014dgen gave to his monks at his monastery, Eihei-ji, were compiled under the title \"Eihei K\u014droku\", also known as \"D\u014dgen Osh\u014d K\u014droku\" (The Extensive Record of Teacher D\u014dgen's Sayings) in ten volumes. The sermons, lectures, sayings and poetry were compiled shortly after D\u014dgen's death by his main disciples, Koun Ej\u014d (, 1198\u20131280), Senne, and Gien. There are three different editions of this text: the Rinn\u014d-ji text from 1598, a popular version printed in 1672, and a version discovered at Eihei-ji in 1937, which, although undated, is believed to be the oldest extant version.\nAnother collection of his talks is the \"Sh\u014db\u014dgenz\u014d Zuimonki\" (Gleanings from Master D\u014dgen's Sayings) in six volumes. These are talks that D\u014dgen gave to his leading disciple, Ej\u014d, who became D\u014dgen's disciple in 1234. The talks were recorded and edited by Ej\u014d.\nOther writings.\nOther notable writings of D\u014dgen are: \nLineage.\nThough Dogen emphasised the importance of the correct transmission of the Buddha dharma, as guaranteed by the line of transmission from Shakyamuni, his own transmission became problematic in the third generation. In 1267 Ej\u014d retired as Abbot of Eihei-ji, giving way to Gikai, who was already favored by D\u014dgen. Gikai introduced esoteric elements into the practice. Opposition arose, and in 1272 Ej\u014d resumed the position of abbot. Following Ej\u014d's death in 1280, Gikai became abbot again, strengthened by the support of the military for magical practices. Opposition arose again, and Gikai was forced to leave Eihei-ji. He was succeeded by Gien, who was first trained in the Daruma-school of N\u014dnin. His supporters designated him as the third abbot, rejecting the legitimacy of Gien.\nJakuen, a student of Rujing, who traced his lineage \"directly back the Zen of the Song period\", established H\u014dky\u014d-ji, where a strict style of Zen was practised. Students of his played a role in the conflict between Giin and Gikai.\nA notable successor of Dogen was Keizan (; 1268\u20131325), founder of S\u014dji-ji Temple and author of the \"Record of the Transmission of Light\" ( \"Denk\u014droku\"), which traces the succession of Zen masters from Siddh\u0101rtha Gautama up to Keizan's own day. Together, D\u014dgen and Keizan are regarded as the founders of the S\u014dt\u014d school in Japan.\nMiraculous events and auspicious signs.\nSeveral \"miraculous experiences\" and \"auspicious signs\" have been recorded in D\u014dgen's life, some of them quite famous. According to Bodiford, \"Monks and laymen recorded these events as testaments to his great mystical power,\" which \"helped confirm the legacy of D\u014dgen's teachings against competing claims made by members of the Buddhist establishment and other outcast groups.\" Bodiford further notes that the \"magical events at Eiheiji helped identify the temple as a cultic center,\" putting it at a par with other temples where supernatural events occurred. According to Faure, for D\u014dgen these auspicious signs were proof that \"Eiheiji was the only place in Japan where the Buddhist Dharma was transmitted correctly and that this monastery was thus rivaled by no other.\"\nIn Menzan Zuih\u014d's well-known 1753 edition of D\u014dgen's biography, it records that while traveling in China with his companion D\u014dsh\u014d, D\u014dgen became very ill, and a deity appeared before him who gave him medicine which instantly healed him:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;D\u014dgen fell gravely ill on his way back from China but had no medicines that could be of use. Suddenly, an immortal appeared and gave D\u014dgen a herbal pill, after which he immediately became better. The master asked this deity to reveal its identity. The mysterious figure replied, \u201cI am the Japanese kami Inari\u201d and disappeared. The medicine became known as Gedokugan, which has been ever since been part of the D\u014dsh\u014d family heritage [...] D\u014dgen then told D\u014dsh\u014d that this rare and wondrous medicine had been bestowed on him by a true kami for the protection of the great Dharma, [and that] this medicine of many benefits should be distributed to temples so that they might spread the Dharma heritage.\nThis medicine, which later became known as Gedokuen or \"Poison-Dispelling Pill\" was then produced by the S\u014dt\u014d church until the Meiji Era, and was commonly sold nationwide as an herbal medicine, and became a source of income for the S\u014dt\u014d church.\nAnother famous incident happened when he was returning to Japan from China. The ship he was on was caught in a storm. In this instance, the storm became so severe, that the crew feared the ship would sink and kill them all. D\u014dgen then began leading the crew in recitation of chants to Kannon (Avalokiteshwara), during which, the Bodhisattva appeared before him, and several of the crew saw her as well. After the vision appeared, the storm began to calm down, and consensus of those aboard was that they had been saved due to the intervention of Bodhisattva Avalokiteshwara. This story is repeated in official works sponsored by the S\u014dt\u014d Sh\u016b Head Office and there is even a sculpture of the event in a water treatment pond in Eihei-ji Temple. Additionally, there is a 14th-century copy of a painting of the same Kannon, that was supposedly commissioned by D\u014dgen, that includes a piece of calligraphy that is possibly an original in D\u014dgen's own hand, recording his gratitude to Avalokiteshwara:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;From the single blossom five leaves uncurled: Upon one single leaf a Tathagata stood alone. Her vow to harmonize our lives is ocean deep, As we spin on and on, shouldering our deeds of right and wrong. \u2013written by the mendicant monk D\u014dgen, September 26, 1242.\nAnother miraculous event occurred, while D\u014dgen was at Eihei-ji. During a ceremony of gratitude for the 16 Celestial Arahants (called Rakan in Japanese), a vision of 16 Arahants appeared before D\u014dgen descending upon a multi-colored cloud, and the statues of the Arahants that were present at the event began to emanate rays of light, to which D\u014dgen then exclaimed:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The Rakans caused to appear felicitous flowers, exceedingly wonderful and beautiful\nD\u014dgen was profoundly moved by the entire experience, and took it as an auspicious sign that the offerings of the ceremony had been accepted. In his writings he wrote:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;As for other examples of the appearance of auspicious signs, apart from [the case of] the rock bridge of Mount Tiantai, [in the province&amp;#93: of Taizhou, in the great kingdom of the Song, nowhere else to my knowledge has there been one to compare with this one. But on this mountain [Kichij\u014dsan, the location of Eiheiji] many apparitions have already happened. This is truly a very auspicious sign showing that, in their deep compassion, [the Arahats] are protecting the men and the Dharma of this mountain. This is why it appeared to me.\u201d\nD\u014dgen is also recorded to have had multiple encounters with non-human beings. Aside from his encounter with the kami Inari in China, in the Denk\u014drou it is recorded that while at K\u014dsh\u014d-ji, he was also visited by a deva who came to observe during certain ceremonies, as well as a dragon who visited him at Eihei-Ji and requested to be given the eight abstinence Precepts:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;When he was at K\u014dsh\u014d-ji a deva used to come to hear the Precepts and join in as an observer at the twice-monthly renewal of Bodhisattva vows. At Eihei-ji a divine dragon showed up requesting the eight Precepts of abstinence and asking to be included among the daily transfers of merit. Because of this D\u014dgen wrote out the eight Precepts every day and offered the merit thereof to the dragon. Up to this very day this practice has not been neglected.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "75343", "revid": "48389443", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=75343", "title": "Jim Shooter", "text": "American comic book writer (1951\u20132025)\nJames Charles Shooter (September 27, 1951 \u2013 June 30, 2025) was an American writer, editor and publisher in the comics industry. Beginning his career writing for DC Comics at the age of 14, he had a successful but controversial run as editor-in-chief at Marvel Comics, and launched comics publishers Valiant, Defiant, and Broadway.\nEarly life.\nJim Shooter was born on September 27, 1951, in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, to parents Ken and Eleanor \"Ellie\" Shooter, who were of Polish descent. Shooter read comics as a child, though he stopped when he was about eight years old. His interest in the medium was rekindled in 1963, at the age of twelve, while he recovered in a hospital after undergoing minor surgery. He was impressed with the style of Marvel Comics, which had begun publication only two years earlier. Thinking that if he learned to write the types of stories that Marvel published, he would be an asset to DC Comics \u2013 whose books, he felt, \"needed the help\" \u2013 Shooter spent about a year reading and studying comics from both companies.\nCareer.\nDC Comics.\nAt age 13, in mid-1965, Shooter wrote and drew stories featuring the Legion of Super-Heroes, and sent them in to DC Comics. On February 10, 1966, he received a phone call from editor Mort Weisinger, who wanted to purchase the stories Shooter had sent, and commissioned Shooter to write Supergirl and Superman stories. Weisinger eventually offered Shooter a regular position on \"Legion\", and wanted Shooter to come to New York to spend a couple of days in his office. Shooter, who was 14 and living in Pittsburgh, had to wait until school was in recess, after which he went to New York with his mother, spurred in part by the need to support his financially struggling parents.\nAccording to Shooter, his father earned little as a steelworker, and Shooter saw comic-book writing as a means of helping support the family. Shooter reflected in a 2010 interview:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;My family needed the money. I was doing this to save the house; my father had a beat-up old car and the engine died \u2013 this is before I started working for DC \u2013 and that first check bought a rebuilt engine for his car so he didn't have to walk to work anymore. I was doing this because I had to, working my way through high school to help keep my family alive.\nAt 14, Shooter began selling stories to DC Comics, writing for both \"Action Comics\" and \"Adventure Comics\", beginning with \"Adventure Comics\" #346 (July 1966), and providing pencil breakdowns as well. With considerable study of the writing style of DC Comics and of the recently rising Marvel Comics, Shooter created several characters for the Legion of Super-Heroes that benefited by him being one of the few writers at DC to understand the competitor's successful character-based narrative approach. This included Legionnaires Karate Kid, Ferro Lad, and Princess Projectra, as well as the villainous group known as the Fatal Five. He also created the Superman villain Parasite in \"Action Comics\" #340 (Aug. 1966). Shooter and artist Curt Swan devised the first race between the Flash and Superman, two characters known for their superhuman speed, in \"Superman's Race with the Flash!\" in \"Superman\" #199 (Aug. 1967). Shooter wrote the first issue of \"Captain Action\" (Oct.-Nov. 1968), which was DC's first toy tie-in.\nIn 1969, Shooter was accepted into New York University, but after graduating from high school he successfully applied for a job at Marvel Comics. Unable to pursue both his studies and work for Marvel, he decided against going to New York University and quit working for DC as well. While at Marvel, Shooter worked as an editor and occasional co-plotter, taking his residence at the YMCA. After only three weeks, Shooter gave up the post due to his financial situation and returned to Pittsburgh.\nAfter leaving Marvel, Shooter took up work in advertising concepts, writing, and illustration for several years, supporting himself through several menial jobs during periods when advertising work was unavailable. An interview for a \"Legion of Super-Heroes\" fanzine led to his again applying to both Marvel and DC. Though both companies offered him work, Shooter opted to return to DC because they had offered him more prestigious assignments: \"Superman\" and a chance to again write the Legion of Super-Heroes, now in their own book, \"Superboy and the Legion of Super-Heroes\". However, Shooter's relationships with both \"Superman\" editor Julius Schwartz and \"Legion\" editor Murray Boltinoff were unpleasant, and he claimed that both forced him to do unnecessary rewrites. In December 1975, Marvel editor-in-chief Marv Wolfman called to offer Shooter an editorial position.\nMarvel Comics.\nIn the mid-1970s, Marvel Comics was undergoing a series of changes in the position of editor-in-chief. After Roy Thomas stepped down from the post to focus on writing, a succession of other editors, including Len Wein, Marv Wolfman, Gerry Conway, and Archie Goodwin took the job during a relatively short span of time, only to find the task too daunting as Marvel continued to grow and add new titles and a larger staff to turn out material. On January 2, 1976, Shooter joined the Marvel staff as an assistant editor and writer.\nWith the quick turnover at the top, Shooter rapidly found himself rising in the ranks, and on the first working day of January 1978, he succeeded Archie Goodwin to become Marvel's ninth editor-in-chief. During this period, publisher Stan Lee relocated to Los Angeles to better oversee Marvel's animation, television and film projects, leaving Shooter largely in charge of the creative decision-making at Marvel's New York City headquarters. Although there were complaints among some that Shooter imposed a dictatorial style on the \"Bullpen\", he cured many of the procedural ills at Marvel, successfully managed to keep the line of books on schedule (ending the widespread practice of missed deadlines popularly known as \"the Dreaded Deadline Doom\"), added new titles, and developed new talent. Shooter in his nine-year tenure as editor-in-chief oversaw Chris Claremont and John Byrne's run on the \"Uncanny X-Men\", Byrne's work on \"Fantastic Four\", Frank Miller's series of \"Daredevil\" stories, Walt Simonson's crafting of Norse mythology with the Marvel Universe in \"Thor\", and Roger Stern's runs on both \"Avengers\" and \"The Amazing Spider-Man\".\nIn 1981, Shooter brought Marvel into the lucrative comic book specialty shop market with \"Dazzler\" #1. Featuring a disco-themed heroine with ties to the X-Men (based upon an unmade film that had been set to star Bo Derek), the first issue of this series was sold only through specialty stores, bypassing the then-standard newsstand/spinner rack distribution route altogether, as recognition by Marvel of the growing comics shop sector. Subsequent issues of \"Dazzler\" were sold through newsstand [returnable] accounts as well. \"Dazzler\" was the first direct sales-only ongoing series from a major publisher; other Marvel titles, such as \"Marvel Fanfare\" and \"Ka-Zar\", soon followed. Later that same year, Shooter wrote \"Marvel Treasury Edition\" No. 28 which featured the second Superman and Spider-Man intercompany crossover. Additionally in 1981, Shooter was recognized as one of six \"New Yorkers of the Year\" by the New York chapter of Junior Chamber International, for his \"contributions toward revitalizing the comics industry and helping Marvel Comics achieve a new pinnacle of success.\" Shooter also instituted creator royalties, starting the Epic imprint for creator-owned material in 1982; introduced company-wide crossover events, with \"Marvel Super Hero Contest of Champions\" and \"Secret Wars\"; and launched a new, albeit ultimately unsuccessful, line named \"New Universe\", to commemorate Marvel's 25th anniversary, in 1986.\nDespite his success in revitalizing Marvel, Shooter angered and alienated a number of long-time Marvel creators by insisting on strong editorial control and strict adherence to deadlines. Although he instituted an art-return program, and implemented a policy giving creators royalties when their books passed certain sales benchmarks or when characters they worked on were licensed as toys, Shooter occasionally found himself in well-publicized conflicts with some writers and artists. Creators such as Steve Gerber, Marv Wolfman, Gene Colan, John Byrne, and Doug Moench left to work for DC (encouraged by its new publisher, Jenette Kahn, aggressively taking advantage of the opportunity) or other companies.\nDuring Shooter's tenure, he enforced a policy forbidding the portrayal of gay characters in the Marvel universe. According to John Byrne, he initially had to conceal Northstar's sexuality, since Shooter personally told him that portraying a gay character would not be allowed. Marvel nonetheless published the first gay-themed story by a mainstream comics publisher during this time, written by Shooter himself; in it, two gay men attempt to rape Bruce Banner. Comics historian Frederick Luis Aldama says that Marvel under Shooter's tenure \"was widely considered homophobic.\"\nRoy Thomas, who left Marvel following a contract dispute with Shooter, reflected in 2005 on Shooter's editorial policies:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;When Jim Shooter took over, for better or worse he decided to rein things in\u00a0\u2013 he wanted stories told the way he wanted them told. It's not a matter of whether Jim Shooter was right or wrong; it's a matter of a different approach. He was editor-in-chief and had a right to impose what he wanted to. I thought it was kind of dumb, but I don't think Jim was dumb. I think the approach was wrong, and I don't think it really helped anything.\nJohn Romita Sr. said:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Shooter had been great for the first two or three years. He got the creative people treated with more respect, got us sent to conventions first-class with our ways paid, and we thought the world of him. Then his Secret Wars was a big hit, and after that he decided he knew everything and he started changing everybody's stuff.\nJohn Byrne said similarly:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Shooter came along just when Marvel needed him\u00a0\u2013 but he stayed too long. Having fixed just about everything that was wrong, he could not stop \"fixing\". Around the time I left to do Superman, I said that I thought Shooter and Dick Giordano should trade jobs\u00a0\u2013 it was DC that needed fixing then\u00a0\u2013 and do so about every 5 years or so. Shooter had put Marvel into a place where all that was needed was a kindly father figure at the helm\u00a0\u2013 and that was not Shooter! ... \"Secret Wars\" ... was when the trouble really kicked into high gear. We must never forget that \"SECRET WARS\" began as a toy promotion. ... Shooter turned it into a way to reshape the Marvel Universe in his image.\nShooter was fired from Marvel on April 15, 1987.\nValiant Comics.\nShooter and his investors then founded a new company, Voyager Communications, which published comics under the Valiant Comics banner, entering the market in 1989 with comics based on Nintendo and WWF licensed characters. Two years later, Valiant entered the superhero market with a relaunch of the Gold Key Comics character Magnus, Robot Fighter. Another Gold Key character, Solar, Man of the Atom was also relaunched later in the same year. Shooter brought many of Marvel's creators to Valiant, including Bob Layton and Barry Windsor-Smith, as well as industry veterans such as Don Perlin. Valiant also established \"knob row\", in which creators were taught how to render the company's comics in the Valiant style.\nOccasionally over the years, Shooter was required to fill in as penciller on various books he wrote or oversaw as editor. During his period as Valiant's publisher, money and talent were often at a premium, and Shooter was sporadically forced to pencil a story. To conceal this fact, he drew under the pseudonym of Paul Creddick, the name of his brother-in-law.\nDefiant and Broadway Comics.\nAfter being ousted from Valiant in 1992, Shooter and several of his co-workers went on to found Defiant Comics in early 1993. Despite some initial success with the first title, the new company failed to secure an audience in the increasingly crowded direct sales market and went out of business after thirteen months of publishing.\nIn 1995, Shooter founded Broadway Comics, which was an offshoot of Broadway Video, the production company that produces \"Saturday Night Live\", but this line ended after its parent sold the properties to Golden Books. In 1998, he spoke of a planned self-publishing, Daring Comics, with a projected eight titles including \"Anomalies\" and \"Rathh of God\", with artist Joe James scheduled to draw at least one.\nShooter returned to Valiant, by now called Acclaim Comics, briefly in 1999 to write \"Unity 2000\" (an attempt to combine and revitalize the older and newer Valiant Universes) but Acclaim went out of business after the completion of only three of the planned six issues.\n2000\u20132025.\nIn 2003, Jim Shooter joined custom comics company Illustrated Media as creative director and editor in chief.\nIn 2005, former Marvel Comics letterer Denise Wohl approached Shooter to create \"Seven\", a series based on the Kabbalah. Shooter created a team of seven characters, one from each continent, who are brought together in New York because they share a higher consciousness. The project, which was to be self-published by Wohl, was announced at the 2007 New York Comic Con, to debut in July of that year, and was projected to \"evolve into television and film projects, video games, blogs, interactive Q&amp;A, animation, trading cards, apparel, accessories, [and] school supplies.\" Wohl was to donate a portion of her proceeds to the \"Spirituality for Kids Foundation.\" Only the first issue of the series was published.\nIn September 2007, DC Comics announced that Shooter would be the new writer of the \"Legion of Super-Heroes\" vol. 5 series, beginning with issue #37. Shooter's return to the \"Legion\", a little over 30 years from his previous run, was his first major published comic book work in years. Shooter co-created the new Legionnaire Gazelle with artist Francis Manapul while on the title. His run on the series ended with issue No. 49, one issue before the book was canceled.\nShooter was hired by Valiant Entertainment, a company that bought Valiant's intellectual property in a bankruptcy auction of Acclaim Entertainment, to write from the end of 2008 into the summer of 2009.\nIn July 2009, Dark Horse Comics announced at San Diego Comic-Con that Shooter would oversee the publication of new series based on Gold Key Comics characters from the Silver Age of Comic Books, such as Turok, Doctor Solar, and Magnus: Robot Fighter, and write some of them as well. Valiant sued Shooter over his moving to write the Gold Key characters for Dark Horse as they expected to get the rights and that he interfered with their ability to license the Key characters by indicating that he would write them for Dark Horse. As of January 2010, Valiant had given up the lawsuit against Shooter. He subsequently wrote the relaunched \"Magnus: Robotfighter\", \"Turok\" and \"Dr. Solar\" series as well as \"Mighty Samson\", another Gold Key character (that had not been picked up by Valiant Comics), for Dark Horse, beginning in 2010.\nIn his last years, Shooter worked as consulting editor and freelance writer for custom comics company Illustrated Media.\nIllness and death.\nShooter was diagnosed with esophageal cancer in 2024, and died of the disease at his home in Nyack, New York, on June 30, 2025. He was 73.\nBibliography.\nAs writer unless otherwise noted.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Collins briefly wrote the \"Batman\" comic book in 1987 and crafted a new origin for the Jason Todd character. Collins and artist Terry Beatty created Wild Dog at DC that same year in a self-titled limited series. The character later appeared as a feature in the \"Action Comics Weekly\" anthology. As of 2016, Wild Dog became a recurring character in the \"Arrow\" television series and is portrayed by actor Rick Gonzalez.\nAnother Collins contribution to the Batman franchise was scripting the English-language translation of \"\" in 2003. He wrote books to expand on the \"Dark Angel\" TV series. He has written books and comics based on the TV series franchise \"CSI\". In 2006 he wrote \"Buried Deep\" (also released as \"Bones Buried Deep\"), based on the TV series \"Bones\".\nHe has written two sequel novels to \"Road to Perdition\": \"Road to Purgatory\" and \"Road to Paradise\".

The two collaborated on a comic book series in the 1990s called \"Mike Danger\". Upon Spillane's death in 2006, Collins was entrusted to finish various uncompleted works by Spillane including \"Dead Street\", \"The Big Showdown\", and an ongoing series of Mike Hammer novel completions, beginning with \"The Goliath Bone\" in 2008.

He won the Shamus Award in 1984 and 1992.\nSelected bibliography.\n\"Quarry\" series.\nThis series features a former U.S. Marine sniper turned professional assassin after returning from the Vietnam War in 1973. The books are narrated in first person by Quarry (a code name). He maintains his own code of honor, and rationalizes his crimes by taking contracts to kill people who he believes brought about their own demise and will eventually be murdered by one enemy or another (e.g., corrupt politicians, mobsters, exploitative businessmen, drug traffickers).

After being betrayed by Broker, Quarry steals a batch of classified documents and shifts his focus to offering his services to those who are targeted for assassination.\nCinemax created a TV adaptation of \"Quarry\". Written by Michael D. Fuller and Graham Gordy based loosely on the book series, the project centers on a Marine marksman who, upon returning home from Vietnam in 1972, finds himself shunned by those he loves and demonized by the public. The disillusioned vet is quickly recruited into a network of contract killers and corruption spanning the Mississippi River.

A suburb of Los Angeles, it is located southwest of the Hollywood Hills, approximately northwest of downtown Los Angeles. The city's land area totals and (together with the neighboring smaller city of West Hollywood to the east) is entirely surrounded by the city of Los Angeles. According to the 2020 census, the city has a population of 32,701, marking a decrease of 1,408 from the 2010 census count of 34,109.\nIn American popular culture, Beverly Hills has been known as an affluent location within Greater Los Angeles, which corresponds to higher property values and taxes in the area. The city is well known for its Rodeo Drive shopping district that includes many designer brands. Throughout its history, the city has been home to many . It is noted for numerous hotels and resorts, including the Beverly Hilton and the Beverly Hills Hotel. The city has been featured in many movies, television series, music, and media, in the United States and internationally.\nAfter its initial settlement in 1828, Beverly Hills was originally a primarily agricultural community centered around Rancho Rodeo de las Aguas, a Mexican-era rancho grant. Beverly Hills was first incorporated as a city in September 1914 by a group of investors who had failed to find oil but found water instead, and eventually decided to develop it into a town.\nHistory.\nEarly history.\nGaspar de Portol\u00e1 arrived in the area that would later become Beverly Hills on August 3, 1769, traveling along native trails which followed the present-day route of Wilshire Boulevard. The area was settled by Californio ranchera Mar\u00eda Rita Quinteros de Valdez and her husband in 1828. They called their of property the \"Rancho Rodeo de las Aguas\". In 1854, she sold the ranch to Benjamin Davis Wilson (1811\u20131878) and Henry Hancock (1822\u20131883). By the 1880s, the ranch had been subdivided into parcels of and was being rapidly bought up by Anglos from Los Angeles and the East coast.\nHenry Hammel and Andrew H. Denker acquired most of it and used it for farming lima beans. At this point, the area was known as the Hammel and Denker Ranch. By 1888, they were planning to build a town called Morocco on their holdings.\n20th century.\nIn 1900, Burton E. Green, Charles A. Canfield, Max Whittier, Frank H. Buck, Henry E. Huntington, William G. Kerckhoff, William F. Herrin, W.S. Porter, and Frank H. Balch formed the Amalgamated Oil Company, bought the Hammel and Denker ranch, and began looking for oil. They did not find enough to exploit commercially by the standards of the time, though. In 1906, therefore, they reorganized as the Rodeo Land and Water Company, renamed the property \"Beverly Hills\", subdivided it, and began selling lots. The development was named \"Beverly Hills\" after Beverly Farms in Beverly, Massachusetts, and because of the hills in the area.\nThe \"Los Angeles Times\" reported on September 2, 1906:\nPercy H. Clark Company are managing the development of the foothill portion of the Hammel &amp; Denker ranch for the Rodeo Land and Water Company (the Canfield-Huntington-Kerckhoff syndicate), to be known as Beverly Hills. No expense is being spared to make this a fine suburban district. .\u00a0.\u00a0. The property has been laid out on beautiful curved lines.\nThe first house in the subdivision was built in 1907, but sales remained slow.\nRestrictive covenants.\nBeverly Hills was one of many all-white planned communities started in the Los Angeles area around this time. Restrictive covenants prohibited non-whites from owning or renting property, unless they were employed as servants by white residents. It was also forbidden to sell or rent property to Jews in Beverly Hills.\nIncorporation.\nBurton Green began construction on The Beverly Hills Hotel in 1911. The hotel was finished in 1912. The visitors drawn by the hotel were inclined to purchase land in Beverly Hills, and by 1914 the population had grown enough to qualify for incorporation as an independent city. That same year, the Rodeo Land and Water Company decided to separate its water business from its real estate business. The Beverly Hills Utility Commission was split off from the land company and incorporated in September 1914, buying all of the utilities-related assets from the Rodeo Land and Water Company.\nIn 1919, Douglas Fairbanks and Mary Pickford bought land on Summit Drive and built a mansion, finished in 1921 and nicknamed \"Pickfair\" by the press. The glamour associated with Fairbanks and Pickford as well as other movie stars who built mansions in the city contributed to its growing appeal.\nWater supply.\nBy the early 1920s, the population of Beverly Hills had grown enough to make the water supply a political issue. In 1923, the usual solution, annexation to the city of Los Angeles, was proposed. There was considerable opposition to annexation among such famous residents as Pickford, Fairbanks, Will Rogers and Rudolph Valentino. The Beverly Hills Utility Commission, opposed to annexation as well, managed to force the city into a special election and the plan was defeated 337 to 507.\nIn 1928, the Beverly Wilshire Apartment Hotel (now the Beverly Wilshire Hotel) opened on Wilshire Boulevard between El Camino and Rodeo drives, part of the old Beverly Hills Speedway. That same year, oilman Edward L. Doheny finished construction of Greystone Mansion, a 55-room mansion meant as a wedding present for his son Edward L. Doheny Jr. The house is now owned by the city of Beverly Hills and is a designated historical landmark.\nIn the early 1930s, Santa Monica Park was renamed Beverly Gardens and was extended to span the entire two-mile (3-kilometer) length of Santa Monica Boulevard through the city. The Electric Fountain marks the corner of Santa Monica Blvd. and Wilshire Blvd. with a small sculpture at the top of a Tongva kneeling in prayer. In April 1931, the new Italian Renaissance-style Beverly Hills City Hall was opened.\n1948: restrictive covenants found unenforceable.\nIn the early 1940s, black actors and businessmen had begun to move into Beverly Hills, despite the covenants allowing only whites to live in the city. A neighborhood improvement association attempted to enforce the covenants in court. The defendants included prominent artists Hattie McDaniel, Louise Beavers, and Ethel Waters. Among the white residents supporting the lawsuit against blacks was Harold Lloyd, the silent film star. The NAACP participated in the defense, which was successful. In his decision, federal judge Thurmond Clarke said that it was time that \"members of the Negro race are accorded, without reservations or evasions, the full rights guaranteed to them under the 14th amendment.\" The United States Supreme Court declared restrictive covenants unenforceable in 1948 in \"Shelley v. Kraemer\". A group of Jewish residents of Beverly Hills filed an amicus brief in this case.\nIn 1956, Paul Trousdale (1915\u20131990) purchased the Doheny Ranch and developed it into Trousdale Estates, convincing the city of Beverly Hills to annex it. The neighborhood has been home to Elvis Presley, Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, Tony Curtis, Ray Charles, and President Richard Nixon, as well as, in later years, Jennifer Aniston, David Spade, Vera Wang and John Rich.\nFollowing the 1979 Islamic Revolution in Iran, many Persian Jews settled in Beverly Hills.\nIn the late 1990s, Metro proposed to build an extension of the Metro D Line along Wilshire Boulevard into Downtown Beverly Hills, but the city opposed it. Section 2 of the D Line Extension will include a station at Wilshire Boulevard and Rodeo Drive that will open in 2026.\n21st century.\nIn 2001, LACMTA proposed a bus rapid transit route down Santa Monica Boulevard, but this was opposed by the city and never built. This stretch of road is served by less efficient Metro Rapid buses using pre-existing roadways. By 2010, traffic in Beverly Hills and surrounding areas had deteriorated enough that the city's habitual opposition had largely turned to support for subways within the city limits. As part of the D Line Extension project, the D Line of the Los Angeles Metro Rail was intended in 2013 to be extended through Beverly Hills, adding two underground stations at Wilshire/La Cienega and Beverly Drive by the 2020s.\nThe city of Beverly Hills widely opposed Proposition 8, the 2008 ballot measure which repealed legal recognition of same-sex marriages. The proposition narrowly passed statewide, but in Beverly Hills, only 34% voted in favor, and 66% voted against it.\nIn the midst of the 2015 drought, Beverly Hills was found to be one of the largest water consumers in California. As a result, it was asked by the state to reduce consumption by 36%, prompting many residents to replace their lawns with native plants. Meanwhile, the city government replaced the grass in front of the City Hall with Mexican sage.\nIn September 2015, the City of Beverly Hills signed an agreement with Israel to work together on water use as well as \"cybersecurity, public health, emergency services, disaster preparedness, public safety, counterterrorism and art and culture\".\nIn July 2016, the City of Beverly Hills received the Livability Award from the United States Conference of Mayors for its Ambassador Program, which takes care of the city's homeless population.\nThe Beverly Hills Community Dog Park was dedicated on September 6, 2016.\nIn 2024, the California Attorney General held Beverly Hills accountable for preventing reproductive health clinic from opening, failing to protect California's Constitutional Right to Abortion.\nGeography.\nBeverly Hills and the neighboring city of West Hollywood are together entirely surrounded by the city of Los Angeles.

Featuring a plain white sleeve, the cover contains no graphics or text other than the band's name embossed. This was intended as a direct contrast to the vivid cover artwork of the band's previous LP, \"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\" (1967). \"The Beatles\" is recognized for its fragmentary style and diverse range of genres, including folk, country rock, British blues, ska, music hall, hard rock, and avant-garde. It has since been viewed by some critics as a postmodern work, and is widely regarded as one of the greatest albums of all time.&lt;ref name=\"Orlando/NewYorker\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The album was the band's first LP release on their then-recently founded Apple Records after previous albums were released on Parlophone in the United Kingdom and Capitol Records in the United States.\nIn late May 1968, the Beatles returned to EMI Studios in London to commence recording sessions that lasted until mid-October. During these sessions, arguments frequently broke out among the foursome over creative differences and the presence of John Lennon's new partner, Yoko Ono, which subverted the Beatles' policy of excluding wives and girlfriends from the studio. After a series of problems, including producer George Martin taking an unannounced holiday and engineer Geoff Emerick suddenly quitting during a session, Ringo Starr left the band for two weeks in August. The same tensions continued throughout the following year and led to the band's break-up.\nThe album features 30 songs, 19 of which were written during March and April 1968 at a Transcendental Meditation course in Rishikesh, India. There, the only Western instrument available to the band was the acoustic guitar; several of these songs remained acoustic on \"The Beatles\" and were recorded solo, or only by part of the group. The production aesthetic ensured that the album's sound was scaled down and less reliant on studio innovation than most of their releases since \"Revolver\" (1966). \"The Beatles\" also broke with the band's tradition at the time of incorporating several musical styles in one song by keeping each piece of music consistently faithful to a select genre.\n\"The Beatles\" received favourable reviews from most music critics; detractors found its satirical songs unimportant and apolitical amid the turbulent political and social climate of 1968. It topped record charts in Britain and the United States. No singles were issued in either territory, but \"Hey Jude\" and \"Revolution\" originated from the same recording sessions and were issued as a single in August 1968. The album has since been certified 24\u00d7 platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), tied for fifth all time. A of the album was released in 2018 to commemorate its 50th anniversary.\nBackground.\nBy 1968, the Beatles had achieved unprecedented levels of commercial and critical success. The group's mid-1967 release, \"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\", was number one in the UK for 27 weeks, until the start of February 1968, having sold 250,000 copies in the first week after release. \"Time\" magazine declared that \"Sgt. Pepper\" constituted a \"historic departure in the progress of music \u2013 any music\", while the American writer Timothy Leary wrote that the band were \"the wisest, holiest, most effective avatars (Divine Incarnate, God Agents) that the human race has ever produced\". The band received a negative critical response to their television film \"Magical Mystery Tour\", which aired in Britain in December 1967, but fan reaction was nevertheless positive.\nMost of the songs for \"The Beatles\" were written during a Transcendental Meditation course with Maharishi Mahesh Yogi in Rishikesh, India, between February and April 1968. The retreat involved long periods of meditation, conceived by the band as a spiritual respite from all worldly endeavours \u2013 a chance, in John Lennon's words, to \"get away from everything\". Lennon and Paul McCartney quickly re-engaged themselves in songwriting, often meeting \"clandestinely in the afternoons in each other's rooms\" to review their new work. \"Regardless of what I was supposed to be doing,\" Lennon later recalled, \"I did write some of my best songs there.\" Author Ian MacDonald said \"Sgt Pepper\" was \"shaped by LSD\", but the Beatles took no drugs with them to India aside from marijuana, and their clear minds helped the group with their songwriting. The stay in Rishikesh proved especially fruitful for George Harrison as a songwriter, coinciding with his re-engagement with the guitar after two years studying the sitar. The musicologist Walter Everett likens Harrison's development as a composer in 1968 to that of Lennon and McCartney five years before, although he notes that Harrison became \"privately prolific\", given his usual subordinate status within the group.\nThe Beatles left Rishikesh before the end of the course. Ringo Starr was the first to leave, less than two weeks later, as he said he could not tolerate the food; McCartney departed in mid-March, while Harrison and Lennon were more interested in Indian religion and remained until April. Lennon left Rishikesh because he felt personally betrayed after hearing rumours that the Maharishi had behaved inappropriately towards women who accompanied the Beatles to India. McCartney and Harrison later discovered the accusations to be untrue and Lennon's wife Cynthia reported there was \"not a shred of evidence or justification\".\nCollectively, the group wrote around 40 new songs in Rishikesh, 26 of which would be recorded in rough form at Kinfauns, Harrison's home in Esher, in May 1968. Lennon wrote the bulk of the new material, contributing 14 songs. Lennon and McCartney brought home-recorded demos to the session, and worked on them together. Some home demos and group sessions at Kinfauns were later released on the 1996 compilation \"Anthology 3\". The whole set of Esher demos was released in the remixed 50th anniversary deluxe edition in 2018.\nStyle and production.\nSessions.\n\"The Beatles\" was recorded between 30 May and 14 October 1968, largely at Abbey Road Studios in London, with some sessions at Trident Studios. Their time in Rishikesh was soon forgotten in the tense atmosphere of the studio, with sessions occurring at irregular hours. The group's self-belief led to the formation of a new multimedia business corporation, Apple Corps, an enterprise that drained the group financially with a series of unsuccessful projects.\nThe group block-booked time at Abbey Road through July. The open-ended studio time led to a new way of working out songs. Instead of tightly rehearsing a backing track, as in previous sessions, the group recorded all the rehearsals and jamming, then added overdubs to the best take. The production aesthetic ensured that the album's sound was scaled down and less reliant on studio innovation than \"Revolver\" and \"Sgt. Pepper\". Harrison's song \"Not Guilty\" was left off the album, though 102 takes were recorded.\nOnly 16 of the album's 30 tracks feature all four band members performing. Several backing tracks do not feature the full group, and overdubs tended to be performed by the song writer. McCartney and Lennon sometimes recorded simultaneously in different studios with different engineers. George Martin's influence had gradually waned, and he left abruptly to go on a holiday during the recording sessions, leaving his young prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Chris Thomas in charge of production.\nDuring the sessions, the band upgraded from 4-track recording to 8-track. As work began, Abbey Road Studios possessed, but had yet to install, an 8-track machine that had supposedly been sitting unused for several months. This was in accordance with EMI's policy of testing and customising new gear extensively before putting it into use. The Beatles recorded \"Hey Jude\" and \"Dear Prudence\" at Trident because it had an 8-track console. When they learned that EMI also had one, they insisted on using it, and engineers Ken Scott and Dave Harries installed the machine (without studio management authorisation) in Abbey Road's Studio 2.\nThe band held their first and only 24-hour session at Abbey Road during the final mixing and sequencing for the album. This session was attended by Lennon, McCartney and Martin; Harrison had left on a trip to the US the day before. Unlike most LPs, there was no customary three-second gap between tracks, and the master was edited so that songs segued together, via a straight edit, a crossfade, or an incidental piece of music.\nGenres and length.\n\"The Beatles\" contains a wide range of musical styles, which authors Barry Miles and Gillian Gaar view as the most diverse of any of the group's albums. These styles include rock and roll, blues, folk, country, reggae, avant-garde, hard rock, and music hall. The only Western instrument available to the group during their Indian visit was the acoustic guitar, and thus many of the songs were written and first performed on that instrument. Some of these songs remained acoustic on \"The Beatles\" and were recorded solo or by only part of the group (including \"Wild Honey Pie\", \"Blackbird\", \"Julia\", \"I\u00a0Will\" and \"Mother Nature's Son\").\nAuthor Nicholas Schaffner views the acoustic slant as reflective of a widespread departure from the LSD-inspired psychedelia of 1967, an approach initiated by Bob Dylan and the Beach Boys and adopted in 1968 by artists such as the Rolling Stones and the Byrds. Edwin Faust of \"Stylus Magazine\" described \"The Beatles\" as \"foremost an album about musical purity (as the album cover and title suggest). Whereas on prior Beatles albums, the band was getting into the habit of mixing several musical genres into a single song, on the White Album every song is faithful to its selected genre. The rock n' roll tracks are purely rock n' roll; the folk songs are purely folk; the surreal pop numbers are purely surreal pop; and the experimental piece is purely experimental.\"\nMartin said he was against the idea of a double album at the time and suggested that the group reduce the number of songs to form a single album featuring their stronger work; the band refused. Reflecting on the album years later, Harrison said that some tracks could have been released as B-sides or withheld, but \"there was a lot of ego in that band.\" He also supported the idea of the double album, to clear out the group's backlog of songs. Starr felt that the album should have been two separate records, which he jokingly called \"The White Album\" and \"The Whiter Album\". McCartney said that the record was fine as it was: \"It was great. It sold. It's the bloody Beatles' White Album. Shut up!\"\nPersonal problems.\nDuring the recording sessions for \"The Beatles\", each member of the band began to increasingly assert themselves as individual artists who frequently found themselves at odds. McCartney described the sessions as a turning point for the group because \"there was a lot of friction during that album. We were just about to break up, and that was tense in itself\"; Lennon said, \"the break-up of the Beatles can be heard on that album\". Recording engineer Geoff Emerick had worked with the group since \"Revolver\", but became disillusioned with the sessions. He overheard Martin criticising McCartney's vocal performance while recording \"Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da\", to which McCartney replied, \"Well you come down and sing it\". On 16 July, Emerick announced that because of the frequent bickering and tension, he was no longer willing to work with the Beatles and left the studio in the midst of a session.\n\"The Beatles\" sessions marked the first appearance in the studio of Lennon's new domestic and artistic partner, Yoko Ono, who accompanied him to Abbey Road to work on \"Revolution 1\" and who was thereafter a more or less constant presence at Beatles recording sessions. Ono's presence was highly unorthodox as, up to that point, the Beatles had generally worked in isolation, rarely allowing visitors, wives and girlfriends to attend recording sessions. Lennon's devotion to Ono over the other Beatles made working conditions difficult by impeding communication between Lennon and McCartney, as well as the intuitive aspect that had previously been essential to the band's music. McCartney's girlfriend at the time, Francie Schwartz, was also present at some sessions, as were the other two Beatles' wives, Pattie Harrison and Maureen Starkey.\nPeter Doggett writes that \"the most essential line of communication\" had been broken between Lennon and McCartney by Ono's presence on the first day of recording. Beatles biographer Philip Norman comments that the two shared a disregard for the other's new songs; Lennon found McCartney's songs \"cloyingly sweet and bland\", while McCartney viewed Lennon's as \"harsh, unmelodious and deliberately provocative\". Harrison and Starr chose to distance themselves partway through the project, flying to California on 7 June so that Harrison could film his scenes for the Ravi Shankar documentary \"Raga\". Lennon's, McCartney's and Harrison's individual projects outside the band in 1968 were further evidence of the group's fragmentation. In Lennon's case, the album cover of his experimental collaboration with Ono, \"Two Virgins\", featured the couple completely naked, a gesture his bandmates found bewildering and unnecessary.\nOn 20 August, Lennon and Starr were working on overdubs for \"Yer Blues\" in Studio 3, and visited McCartney in Studio 2 where he was working on \"Mother Nature's Son\". The positive spirit of the session disappeared immediately, and engineer Ken Scott later claimed that \"you could cut the atmosphere with a knife\". Starr abruptly left the studio on 22 August during the session for \"Back in the U.S.S.R.\", feeling that his role in the group was peripheral compared to the other members, and upset at McCartney's constant criticism of his drumming on the track. Abbey Road staff later commented that Starr was usually the first to arrive at the studio, waiting in the reception area for the others to arrive. In his absence, McCartney played the drums on \"Dear Prudence\". For \"Back in the U.S.S.R.\", the three remaining Beatles each made contributions on bass and drums, and the drum part is a composite of Lennon, McCartney, and Harrison's playing. Lennon, McCartney, and Harrison pleaded with Starr to reconsider. He returned on 5 September to find his drum kit decorated with flowers, a welcome-back gesture from Harrison.\nMono version.\n\"The Beatles\" was the last Beatles album to be mixed separately for stereo and mono. All but two tracks exist in official mono mixes; the exceptions are \"Revolution 1\" and \"Revolution 9\", both direct reductions of the stereo master. The Beatles had not been particularly interested in stereo until this album, but after receiving mail from fans stating they bought both stereo and mono mixes of earlier albums, they decided to make the two different. Several mixes have different track lengths; the mono mix/edit of \"Helter Skelter\" eliminates the fade-in at the end of the song (and Starr's ending scream), and the fade-out of \"Yer Blues\" is 11 seconds longer on the mono mix. Several songs have missing or different overdubs or effects which differ from the stereo mixes.\nIn the United States, mono records were already being phased out; the US release of \"The Beatles\" was the first Beatles LP to be issued in stereo only. In the UK, the Beatles' following album, \"Yellow Submarine\", was the last to be issued in mono. The mono version of \"The Beatles\" was made available worldwide on 9 September 2009, as part of \"The Beatles in Mono\" CD boxed set. The original mono LP was rereleased worldwide in September 2014.\nSongs.\nSide one.\nMcCartney wrote \"Back in the U.S.S.R.\" as a parody of Chuck Berry's song \"Back in the U.S.A.\" and the Beach Boys. A field recording of a jet aeroplane taking off and landing was used at the start of the track, and intermittently throughout it. The backing vocals were sung by Lennon and Harrison in the style of the Beach Boys, further to Mike Love's suggestion in Rishikesh that McCartney include mention of the \"girls\" in the USSR. The track became widely bootlegged in the Soviet Union, where the Beatles' music was banned, and became an underground hit.\n\"Dear Prudence\" was one of the songs recorded at Trident. The style is typical of the acoustic songs written in Rishikesh, using guitar arpeggios. Lennon wrote the track about Mia Farrow's sister Prudence Farrow, who rarely left her room during the stay in commitment to the meditation.\n\"Glass Onion\" was the first backing track recorded as a full band after Starr's brief departure. MacDonald claimed Lennon deliberately wrote the lyrics to mock fans who claimed to find \"hidden messages\" in songs, and referenced other songs in the Beatles catalogue\u00a0\u2013 \"The Walrus was Paul\" refers back to \"I Am the Walrus\" (which itself refers to \"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds\"). McCartney, in turn, overdubbed a recorder part after the line \"I told you about the Fool on the Hill\", as a deliberate reference to the earlier song. A string section was added to the track in October.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nLennon went straight to the piano and smashed the keys with an almighty amount of volume, twice the speed of how they'd done it before, and said \"This is it! Come on!\"\nRecording engineer Richard Lush on the final take of \"Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da\"\n\"Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da\" was written by McCartney as a pastiche of ska music. The track took a surprising amount of time to complete, with McCartney demanding perfectionism that annoyed his colleagues. Jimmy Scott, a friend of McCartney, suggested the title and played bongos on the initial take. He demanded a cut of publishing when the song was released, but the song was credited to \"Lennon\u2013McCartney\". After working for three days on the backing track, the work was scrapped and replaced with a new recording. Lennon hated the song, calling it \"granny music shit\", while engineer Richard Lush recalled that Starr disliked having to record the same backing track repetitively, and pinpoints this session as a key indication that the Beatles were going to break up. McCartney attempted to remake the backing track for a third time, but this was abandoned after a few takes and the second version was used as the final mix. The group, save for McCartney, had lost interest in the track by the end of recording, and refused to release it as a single. Marmalade recorded a version that became a number one hit.\nMcCartney recorded \"Wild Honey Pie\" on 20 August at the end of the session for \"Mother Nature's Son\". It is typical of the brief snippets of songs he recorded between takes during the album sessions.\n\"The Continuing Story of Bungalow Bill\" was written by Lennon after an American visitor to Rishikesh left for a few weeks to hunt tigers. It was recorded as an \"audio v\u00e9rit\u00e9\" exercise, featuring vocal performances from almost everyone who happened to be in the studio at the time. Ono sings one line and co-sings another, while Chris Thomas played the Mellotron, including improvisations at the end of the track. The opening flamenco guitar flourish was a recording included in the Mellotron's standard tape library.\n\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\" was written by Harrison during a visit he made to his parents' home in Cheshire. He first recorded the song as a solo performance, on acoustic guitar, on 25 July\u00a0\u2013 a version that remained unreleased until \"Anthology 3\". He was unhappy with the group's first attempt to record the track, and so invited his friend Eric Clapton to come and play on it. Clapton was unsure about guesting on a Beatles record, but Harrison said the decision was \"nothing to do with them. It's my song.\" Clapton's solo was treated with automatic double tracking to attain the desired effect; he gave Harrison the guitar he used, which Harrison later named \"Lucy\".\n\"Happiness Is a Warm Gun\" evolved out of several song fragments that Lennon compiled into one piece, having previewed two of the segments in his May 1968 demo. According to MacDonald, this approach was possibly inspired by the Incredible String Band's songwriting. The basic backing track ran to 95 takes, due to the irregular time signatures and variations in style throughout the song. The final version consisted of the best halves of two takes edited together. Lennon later described the song as one of his favourites, while the rest of the band found the recording rejuvenating, as it forced them to re-hone their skills as a group playing together to get it right. Apple's press officer Derek Taylor made an uncredited contribution to the song's lyrics.\nSide two.\nMcCartney got the title of \"Martha My Dear\" from his Old English Sheepdog, but the lyrics are otherwise unrelated. The entire track is played by him backed with session musicians, and features no other Beatles. Martin composed a brass band arrangement for the track.\n\"I'm So Tired\" was written in India when Lennon was having difficulty sleeping. It was recorded at the same session as \"The Continuing Story of Bungalow Bill\". The lyrics make reference to Walter Raleigh, calling him a \"stupid get\" for introducing tobacco to Europe; while the track ends with Lennon mumbling \"Monsieur, monsieur, how about another one?\" This became part of the Paul is Dead conspiracy theory, when fans claimed that when the track was reversed, they could hear \"Paul is dead man, miss him, miss him, miss him\".\n\"Blackbird\" features McCartney solo, accompanying himself on acoustic guitar. According to Lewisohn, the ticking in the background is a metronome, but Emerick recalls capturing the sound via a microphone placed beside McCartney's shoes. The birdsong on the track was taken from the Abbey Road sound effects collection, and was recorded on one of the first EMI portable tape recorders.\nHarrison wrote \"Piggies\" as an attack on greed and materialism in modern society. His mother and Lennon helped him complete the lyrics. Thomas played harpsichord on the track, while Lennon supplied a tape loop of pigs grunting.\n\"Rocky Raccoon\" evolved from a jam session with McCartney, Lennon and Donovan in Rishikesh. The song was taped in a single session, and was one of the tracks that Martin felt was \"filler\" and put on only because the album was a double.\n\"Don't Pass Me By\" was Starr's first solo composition for the band; he had been toying with the idea of writing a self-reflective song for some time, possibly as far back as 1963. It went by the working titles of \"Ringo's Tune\" and \"This Is Some Friendly\". The basic track consisted of Starr drumming while McCartney played piano. Martin composed an orchestral introduction to the song but it was rejected as \"too bizarre\" and left off the album. Instead, Jack Fallon played a bluegrass fiddle part.\nMcCartney wrote \"Why Don't We Do It in the Road?\" in India after he saw two monkeys copulating in the street and wondered why humans were too civilised to do the same. He played all the instruments except drums, which were contributed by Starr. The simple lyric was very much in Lennon's style, and Lennon was annoyed not to be asked to play on it. McCartney suggested it was \"tit for tat\" as he had not contributed to \"Revolution 9\".\nMcCartney wrote and sang \"I Will\", with Lennon and Starr accompanying on percussion. In between numerous takes, the three Beatles broke off to busk some other songs. A snippet of a track known as \"Can You Take Me Back?\" was put between \"Cry Baby Cry\" and \"Revolution 9\", while recordings of Cilla Black's hit \"Step Inside Love\" and a joke number, \"Los Paranoias\", were released on \"Anthology 3\".\n\"Julia\" was the last track to be recorded for the album and features Lennon on solo acoustic guitar, which he played in a style similar to McCartney's on \"Blackbird\". This is the only Beatles song on which Lennon performs alone. It is a tribute to his mother, Julia Lennon, who was killed in 1958 in a road accident when Lennon was 17, and the lyrics deal with the loss of his mother and his relationship with Ono, the \"ocean child\" in the lyrics. Ono helped with the lyrics, but the song was still credited to Lennon\u2013McCartney as expected.\nSide three.\nAccording to McCartney, the authorship of \"Birthday\" was \"50\u201350 John and me, made up on the spot and recorded all on the same evening\". He and Lennon were inspired to write the song after seeing the first UK showing of the rock 'n' roll film \"The Girl Can't Help It\" on television, and sang the lead vocal in the style of the film's musical star, Little Richard. After the Beatles taped the track, Ono and Pattie Harrison added backing vocals.\nLennon wrote \"Yer Blues\" in India. Despite meditating and the tranquil atmosphere, he still felt unhappy, as reflected in the lyrics. The style was influenced by the British Blues Boom of 1968, which included Fleetwood Mac, Cream, the Jimi Hendrix Experience, Jeff Beck and Chicken Shack. The backing track was recorded in a small room next to the Studio 2 control room. Unusual for a Beatles recording, the four-track source tape was edited directly, resulting in an abrupt cut-off at 3'17\" into the start of another take (which ran into the fadeout).\nMcCartney wrote \"Mother Nature's Son\" in India, and worked on it in isolation from the other members of the band. He performed the track solo alongside a Martin-scored brass arrangement.\n\"Everybody's Got Something to Hide Except Me and My Monkey\" evolved from a jam session and was originally untitled. The final mix was sped up by mixing the tape running at 43 hertz instead of the usual 50. Harrison claimed the title came from one of the Maharishi's sayings (with \"and my monkey\" added later).\n\"Sexy Sadie\" was written as \"Maharishi\" by Lennon shortly after he decided to leave Rishikesh. In a 1980 interview, Lennon acknowledged that the Maharishi was the inspiration for the song: \"I just called him 'Sexy Sadie'.\"\n\"Helter Skelter\" was written by McCartney and was initially recorded in July as a blues number. The band performed the initial takes live and included long passages during which they jammed on their instruments. Because these takes were too long to practically fit on an LP, the song was shelved until September, when a new, shorter version was made. By all accounts, the session was chaotic, but nobody dared suggest to any of the Beatles that they were out of control. Harrison reportedly ran around the studio holding a flaming ashtray above his head, \"doing an Arthur Brown\". The stereo version of the LP includes almost a minute more music than the mono, which culminates in Starr famously shouting \"I've got blisters on my fingers!\" Cult leader and mass murderer Charles Manson was unaware that the term \"helter skelter\" is British English for a spiral slide found on a playground or funfair, and assumed the track had something to do with hell. This was one of the tracks that led Manson to believe the album had coded messages referring to apocalyptic war, and led to his movement of the same name.\nThe final song on side three is Harrison's \"Long, Long, Long\", part of a chord progression he took from Bob Dylan's \"Sad Eyed Lady of the Lowlands\". MacDonald describes the song as Harrison's \"touching token of exhausted, relieved reconciliation with God\" and considered it to be his \"finest moment on \"The Beatles\"\". The recording session for the basic track was one of the longest the Beatles ever undertook, running from the afternoon of 7 October through the night until 7\u00a0am the next day. McCartney played Hammond organ on the track, and an \"eerie rattling\" effect at the end was created by a note causing a wine bottle on top of the organ's Leslie speaker to resonate.\nSide four.\n\"Revolution 1\" was the first track recorded for the album, with sessions for the backing track starting on 30 May. The initial takes were recorded as a possible single, but as the session progressed, the arrangement became slower, with more of a laid-back groove. The group ended the chosen take with a six-minute improvisation that had further overdubs added, before being cut to the length heard on the album. The brass arrangement was added later.\nMcCartney wrote \"Honey Pie\" as a pastiche of the 1920s' flapper dance style. The opening section had the sound of an old 78 RPM record overdubbed while Martin arranged a saxophone and clarinet part in the same style. Lennon played the guitar solo on the track, but later said he hated the song, calling it \"beyond redemption\".\n\"Savoy Truffle\" was named after one of the types of chocolate found in a box of Mackintosh's Good News, which Clapton enjoyed eating. The track featured a saxophone sextet arranged by Thomas, who also played keyboards. Harrison later said that Derek Taylor helped him finish the lyrics.\nLennon began writing \"Cry Baby Cry\" in late 1967 and the lyrics were partly derived from the tagline of an old television commercial. Martin played harmonium on the track.\n\"Revolution 9\" evolved from the overdubs from the \"Revolution 1\" coda. Lennon, Harrison and Ono added further tape collages and spoken word extracts, in the style of Karlheinz Stockhausen. The track opens with an extract of a piano theme from a Royal Schools of Music examination tape, and climaxes with Ono saying \"if you become naked\". Ono was heavily involved in the production, and advised Lennon on what tape loops to use. McCartney was out of the country at the time and did not contribute to the track, and was reportedly unhappy that it was included. He had led similar tape experiments such as \"Carnival of Light\" in January 1967. The track has attracted both interest and disapproval from fans and critics over the years.\nLennon wrote \"Good Night\" as a lullaby for his son Julian, and wanted Starr to sing it. The early takes featured just Lennon on acoustic guitar and Starr singing. Martin scored an orchestral and choral arrangement that replaced the guitar in the final mix, and also played the celesta.\nSingles.\n\"Hey Jude\" was recorded at the end of July 1968 during the sessions for \"The Beatles\" but was issued separately as a single nearly three months before the album's release. This was the first release on Apple Records and ultimately the band's most successful single in the US. The B-side, \"Revolution\", was a different version of the album's \"Revolution\u00a01\". Lennon wanted the original version of \"Revolution\" to be released as a single, but the other three Beatles objected that it was too slow. Instead, a new, faster version, with heavily distorted guitar and an electric piano solo by Nicky Hopkins was featured on the \"Hey Jude\" single.\nThe convention in the British music industry at the time was that singles and albums were distinct entities and should not duplicate songs. But although no singles were taken from \"The Beatles\" in Britain or America, \"Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da\" backed with \"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\" was released in other markets. The single was a commercial success in Australia (where it spent five weeks at number one on the \"Go-Set\" chart), Japan, Austria and Switzerland.\nUnreleased material.\nSome songs the Beatles were working on individually during this period were revisited for inclusion on their subsequent albums, while others were released on the band members' solo albums. According to the bootlegged album of the demos made at Kinfauns, the latter of these two categories includes Lennon's \"Look at Me\" and \"Child of Nature\" (eventually reworked as \"Jealous Guy\"); McCartney's \"Junk\"; and Harrison's \"Not Guilty\" and \"Circles\". In addition, Harrison gave \"Sour Milk Sea\" to the singer Jackie Lomax, whose recording, produced by Harrison, was released in August 1968 as Lomax's debut single on Apple Records. Lennon's \"Mean Mr. Mustard\" and \"Polythene Pam\" were used in the medley on \"Abbey Road\" the following year.\nThe Lennon composition \"What's the New Mary Jane\" was demoed at Kinfauns and recorded formally (by Lennon, Harrison and Ono) during the 1968 album sessions. McCartney taped demos of two compositions at Abbey Road \u2013 \"Etcetera\" and \"The Long and Winding Road\" \u2013 the latter of which the Beatles recorded in 1969 on \"Let It Be\". \"The Beatles\" versions of \"Not Guilty\" and \"What's the New Mary Jane\" and a demo of \"Junk\" were released on \"Anthology 3\".\n\"Revolution (Take 20)\", a previously uncirculated recording, surfaced in 2009 on a bootleg. This ten-minute take was later edited and overdubbed to create two separate tracks: \"Revolution 1\" and the avant-garde \"Revolution 9\".\nRelease.\nPackaging.\n\"The Beatles\" was issued on 22 November 1968 in Britain and three days later in the US. It was the third album to be released by Apple Records, following Harrison's \"Wonderwall Music\" and Lennon and Ono's \"Two Virgins\". The record was referred to as \"the White Album\" immediately upon release.\nConceptual artist Richard Hamilton designed the record sleeve in collaboration with McCartney. Hamilton's design was in stark contrast to Pop artists Peter Blake's and Jann Haworth's elaborate and vivid cover art for \"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\", and consisted of a plain white sleeve. The band's name, in Helvetica, was crookedly blind embossed slightly below the middle of the album's right side. Later vinyl record releases in the US showed the title in grey printed (rather than embossed) letters. Each copy of the record featured a unique stamped serial number, \"to create\", in Hamilton's words, \"the ironic situation of a numbered edition of something like five million copies\". The first four numbered copies were given to the members of the band, making number 0000005 the first copy sold publicly; in 2008, it was purchased for \u00a319,201 on eBay. In 2015, Ringo Starr's copy, number 0000001, sold for a world record $790,000 at auction. In an interview on the Impossible Way of Life podcast, it was first revealed by members of Hotline TNT that the winner of the auction was Jack White and that the album is currently held in the vault at the headquarters of Third Man Records in Nashville, TN.\nThe sleeve included a poster comprising a montage of photographs, with the lyrics of the songs on the back, and a set of four photographic portraits taken by John Kelly. The photographs for the poster were assembled by Hamilton and McCartney, who sorted them in a variety of ways over several days before arriving at the final result.\nDuring production, the album had the working title of \"A Doll's House\". This was changed when the English progressive rock band Family released the similarly titled \"Music in a Doll's House\" earlier that year.\nSales.\nIn the UK, \"The Beatles\" debuted at number one on 7 December 1968 and spent seven weeks at the top of the UK charts (including the entire competitive Christmas season), until it was replaced by the Seekers' \"Best of the Seekers\" on 25 January 1969, dropping to number 2. However, the album returned to the top spot the following week, spending an eighth and final week at number 1. The album was still high in the charts when the Beatles' follow-up album, \"Yellow Submarine\", was released, which reached number 3. In all, \"The Beatles\" spent 22 weeks on the UK charts, far fewer than the 149 weeks for \"Sgt. Pepper\". In September 2013, after the British Phonographic Industry changed their sales award rules, the album was declared as having gone platinum, meaning sales of at least 300,000 copies.\nIn the US, the album achieved huge commercial success. Capitol Records sold over 3.3\u00a0million copies of \"The Beatles\" to stores within the first four days of the album's release. It debuted at number 11 on 14 December 1968, jumped to number 2, and reached number 1 in its third week on 28 December, spending a total of nine weeks at the top. In all, \"The Beatles\" spent 215 weeks on the \"Billboard\" 200. The album has sold over 12\u00a0million copies in the US alone and according to the Recording Industry Association of America, \"The Beatles\" is the Beatles' most-certified album, at 24-times platinum.\nCritical reception.\nContemporary reviews.\nOn release, \"The Beatles\" gained highly favourable reviews from the majority of music critics. \"NME\"'s Alan Smith declared \"God Bless You, Beatles!\" to all of the album except \"Revolution 9\", while \"Rolling Stone\"'s Jann Wenner called it the group's best album yet. Even more mixed critiques were somewhat positive. William Mann of \"The Times\" deemed the release to be \"the most important musical event of the year\", with several tracks worthy of study and appreciation in the following several months. \"Time\" magazine's reviewer wrote that \"The Beatles\" showcased the \"best abilities and worst tendencies\" of the Beatles, as it is skilfully [\"sic\"] performed and sophisticated, but lacks a \"sense of taste and purpose\". \nThe negative minority bemoaned the album's length or found that the music lacked the adventurous quality that had distinguished \"Sgt. Pepper\". In his review for \"The New York Times\", Nik Cohn considered the album \"boring beyond belief\" and said that over half of its songs were \"profound mediocrities\". In a 1971 column, Robert Christgau of \"The Village Voice\" described the album as both \"their most consistent and probably their worst\". Nonetheless, he ranked it as the tenth best album of 1968 in his ballot for \"Jazz &amp; Pop\" magazine's annual critics poll.\nAccording to the author Ian Inglis, the \"fragmentary style\" was a topic of discussion in all reviews, garnering both enthusiastic and negative responses. In \"The Sunday Times\", Derek Jewell summarized, \"Musically, there is beauty, horror, surprise, chaos, order. And that is the world; and that is what The Beatles are on about. Created by, creating for, their age.\"&lt;ref name=\"MacDonald/WhiteRiot\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Another frequently brought-up aspect was the progression of McCartney and Lennon's songwriting quality. Tony Palmer, reviewing for \"The Observer\", argued their's on \"The Beatles\" was the greatest since Franz Schubert. Richard Goldstein of \"The New York Times\" felt it had improved on the double album, and that combined with a lower dependence on studio gimmicks led to a more imaginative album than \"Sgt. Pepper\" or \"Magical Mystery Tour\". \nHowever, he opined that their over-reliance on pastiche and \"private jokes\" stagnated Lennon and McCartney's progress as songwriters. Christgau similarly, and derogatorily, referred to the songs as a \"pastiche of musical exercises\". Jann Wenner of \"Rolling Stone\", was more appreciative of the pastisches, calling the overall product \"the history and synthesis of Western music\". Wenner contended that they were allowed to appropriate other styles and traditions into rock music because their ability and identity were \"so strong that they make it uniquely theirs, and uniquely the Beatles. They are so good that they not only expand the idiom, but they are also able to penetrate it and take it further.\"\nRetrospective assessments.\nIn a 2003 appraisal of the album, for \"Mojo\" magazine, Ian MacDonald wrote that \"The Beatles\" regularly appears among the top 10 in critics' \"best albums of all time\" lists, yet it was a work that he deemed \"eccentric, highly diverse, and very variable [in] quality\".&lt;ref name=\"MacDonald/WhiteRiot55\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Rob Sheffield, writing in \"The Rolling Stone Album Guide\" (2004), said that its songs ranged from the Beatles' \"sturdiest tunes since \"Revolver\"\" to \"self-indulgent filler\". He derided tracks including \"Revolution 9\" and \"Helter Skelter\", but said that picking personal highlights was \"part of the fun\" for listeners. Writing for MusicHound in 1999, \"Guitar World\" editor Christopher Scapelliti described the album as \"self-indulgent and at times unlistenable\" but identified \"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\", \"Happiness Is a Warm Gun\" and \"Helter Skelter\" as \"fascinating standouts\" that made it a worthwhile purchase.\nAccording to \"Slant Magazine\"'s Eric Henderson, \"The Beatles\" is a rarity among the band's recorded works, in that it \"resists reflexive canonisation, which, along with society's continued fragmentation, keeps the album fresh and surprising\". In his review for AllMusic, Stephen Thomas Erlewine said that because of its wide variety of musical styles, the album can be \"a frustratingly scattershot record or a singularly gripping musical experience, depending on your view\". He concludes: \"None of it sounds like it was meant to share album space together, but somehow \"The Beatles\" creates its own style and sound through its mess.\"\nAmong reviews of the 2009 remastered album, Neil McCormick of \"The Daily Telegraph\" found that even its worst songs work within the context of such an eclectic and unconventional collection, which he rated \"one of the greatest albums ever made\". Writing for \"Paste\", Mark Kemp said \"The Beatles\" had been wrongly described as \"three solo works in one (plus a Ringo song)\", saying it \"benefits from each member's wildly different ideas\" and offers \"two of Harrison's finest moments\". In his review for \"The A.V. Club\", Chuck Klosterman wrote that the album found the band at their best and rated it \"almost beyond an A+\". In retrospect, Christgau wrote in 2020 that while he still found the album \"somewhat scattered\", he nevertheless considers it worthy of a \"high A minus\". Contrary to many other retrospective assessments, John O'Reilly of \"The Guardian\" rated the album two stars out of five, stating: \"Inside this mess of a double album is an OK single album whimpering to get out.\" \nIn 2000, \"The Beatles\" was voted number 5 in the third edition of Colin Larkin's \"All Time Top 1000 Albums\". Three years later, \"Rolling Stone\" ranked it at number 10 on the magazine's list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time, a position it maintained in the 2012 revised list. On the 40th anniversary of the album's release, the Vatican newspaper \"L'Osservatore Romano\" wrote that it \"remains a type of magical musical anthology: 30 songs you can go through and listen to at will, certain of finding some pearls that even today remain unparalleled\". In 2011, \"Kerrang!\" placed the album at number 49 on a list of \"The 50 Heaviest Albums Of All Time\". The magazine praised the guitar work in \"Helter Skelter\". The album was also included in the book \"1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die\". In September 2020, \"Rolling Stone\" ranked \"The Beatles\" at number 29 on its new list of the \"500 Greatest Albums of All Time\".\nGiles Martin, son of George Martin and supervisor of the 2018 50th Anniversary remix, stated that, contrary to the prevailing view of \"The Beatles\", he does not believe it was recorded by a band about to implode. He said he came to this conclusion after listening to all the demos and session tapes in preparation for the remix.\nCultural responses.\nThe release coincided with public condemnation of Lennon's treatment of Cynthia, and of his and Ono's joint projects, particularly \"Two Virgins\". The British authorities similarly displayed a less tolerant attitude towards the Beatles, when London Drug Squad officers arrested Lennon and Ono in October 1968 for marijuana possession, a charge that he claimed was false.\nLyrical misinterpretations.\nThe album's lyrics progressed from being vague to open-ended and prone to misinterpretation of authorial intention, such as \"Glass Onion\" (e.g., \"the walrus was Paul\") and \"Piggies\" (\"what they need's a damn good whacking\"). In the case of \"Back in the U.S.S.R.\", the words were interpreted by Christian evangelist David Noebel as further proof of the Beatles' compliance in a Communist plot to brainwash American youth. According to MacDonald, the counterculture of the 1960s analysed \"The Beatles\" above and beyond all of the band's previous releases. Lennon's lyrics on \"Revolution 1\" were misinterpreted with messages he did not intend. In the album version, he advises those who \"talk about destruction\" to \"count me out\". Lennon then follows the sung word \"out\" with the spoken word \"in\". At the time of the album's release \u2013 which followed, chronologically, the up-tempo single version of the song, \"Revolution\" \u2013 that single word \"in\" was taken by the radical political left as Lennon's endorsement of politically motivated violence, which followed the May 1968 Paris riots. However, the album version was recorded first.\nCharles Manson first heard the album not long after it was released. Manson may have found hidden meanings in songs from earlier Beatles albums, but, according to Vincent Bugliosi in \"The Beatles\", Manson allegedly interpreted prophetic significance in several of the songs, including \"Blackbird\", \"Piggies\" (particularly the line \"what they need's a damn good whacking\"), \"Helter Skelter\", \"Revolution 1\" and \"Revolution 9\", and interpreted the lyrics as a sign of imminent violence or war. He and other members and associates of the Manson family repeatedly listened to it, and he allegedly told them that it was an apocalyptic message predicting an uprising of oppressed races, drawing parallels with chapter 9 of the Book of Revelation. Paul McCartney said, \"Charles Manson interpreted that Helter Skelter was something to do with the four horsemen of the Apocalypse.\"\nNew Left criticism.\nFurther to the betrayal they had felt at Lennon's non-activist stance in \"Revolution\", New Left commentators condemned \"The Beatles\" for its failure to offer a political agenda. The Beatles themselves were accused of using eclecticism and pastiche as a means of avoiding important issues in the turbulent political and social climate. Jon Landau, writing for the Liberation News Service, argued that, particularly in \"Piggies\" and \"Rocky Raccoon\", the band had adopted parody because they were \"afraid of confronting reality\" and \"the urgencies of the moment\". Like Landau, many writers among the New Left considered the album outdated and irrelevant; instead, they heralded the Rolling Stones' concurrent release, \"Beggars Banquet\", as what Lennon biographer Jon Wiener terms \"the 'strong solution,' a musical turning outward, toward the political and social battles of the day\".\nPopular music and postmodernism.\nSociologists Michael Katovich and Wesley Longhofer write that the album's release created \"a collective appreciation of it as a 'state-of-the-art' rendition of the current pop, rock, and folk-rock sounds\". The majority of historians categorise \"The Beatles\" as postmodern, emphasising aesthetic and stylistic features of the album; Inglis, for example, lists bricolage, fragmentation, pastiche, parody, reflexivity, plurality, irony, exaggeration, anti-representation and \"meta-art\", and says that it \"has been designated as popular music's first postmodern album\". Authors such as Fredric Jameson, Andrew Goodwin and Kenneth Womack instead situate all of the Beatles' work within a modernist stance, based either on their \"artificiality\" or their ideological stance of progress through love and peace. Scapelliti cites \"The Beatles\" as the source of \"the freeform nihilism echoed \u2026 in the punk and alternative music genres\". In his introduction to \"Rolling Stone\"'s list of the \"100 Greatest Beatles Songs\", Elvis Costello comments on the band's pervasive influence into the 21st century and concludes: \"The scope and license of the White Album has permitted everyone from OutKast to Radiohead to Green Day to Joanna Newsom to roll their picture out on a broader, bolder canvas.\"\nIn early 2013, the Recess Gallery in New York City's SoHo neighbourhood presented \"We Buy White Albums\", an installation by artist Rutherford Chang. The piece was in the form of a record store in which nothing but original pressings of the LP was on display. Chang created a recording in which the sounds of one hundred copies of side one of the first LP were overlaid.\nReissues.\nTape versions of the album did not feature a white cover or the numbering system. Instead, cassette and 8-track versions (issued on two cassettes/cartridges in early 1969) contained cover artwork that featured high contrast black and white (with no grey) versions of the four Kelly photographs. These two-tape releases were both contained in black outer cardboard slipcase covers embossed with the words \"The Beatles\" and the outline of an apple in gold print. The songs on the cassette version of \"The Beatles\" are sequenced differently from the album, in order to equalise the lengths of the tape sides. Two reel-to-reel tape releases of the album were issued, both using the monochrome Kelly artwork. The first, issued by Apple/EMI in early 1969, packaged the entire double-LP on a single tape, with the songs in the same running order as on the LPs. The second release, licensed by Ampex from EMI in early 1970 after the latter ceased manufacture of commercial reel-to-reel tapes, was issued as two separate volumes, and sequenced the songs in the same manner as on the cassette version. The Ampex reel tape version of \"The Beatles\" has become desirable to collectors, as it contains edits on eight tracks not available elsewhere.\nDuring 1978 and 1979, for the album's tenth anniversary, EMI reissued the album pressed on limited edition white vinyl in several countries. In 1981, Mobile Fidelity Sound Lab (MFSL) issued a unique half-speed master variation of the album using the sound from the original master recording. The discs were pressed on high-quality virgin vinyl.\nThe album was reissued, along with the rest of the Beatles catalogue, on compact disc in 1987. Unlike other Beatles CDs in this reissue campaign, the discs for \"The Beatles\" featured solid black-on-white labels instead of the then-conventional black-on-transparent, and releases that packaged each disc into a separate jewel case (rather than a multi-disc \"fatbox\") sported white media trays rather than the typical dark gray. Like the original vinyl pressings, these CD copies also featured individually stamped numbers on the album's front cover (in this case on the cover of the booklet for the first disc). It was reissued again on CD in 1998 as part of a 30th anniversary series for EMI, featuring a scaled-down replication of the original artwork, including the top-loader gatefold sleeve. This was part of a reissue series from EMI that included albums from other artists such as the Rolling Stones and Roxy Music. It was reissued again in 2009 in a new remastered edition.\nA of the album was released in 2018 to celebrate its 50th anniversary.\nTrack listing.\nAll tracks written by Lennon\u2013McCartney, except where noted.

{"id": "75355", "revid": "770058", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=75355", "title": "Jasper", "text": "Chalcedony variety colored by iron oxide\nJasper, an aggregate of microgranular quartz and/or cryptocrystalline chalcedony and other mineral phases, is an opaque, impure variety of silica, usually red, yellow, brown or green in color; and rarely blue. The common red color is due to iron(III) inclusions. Jasper breaks with a smooth surface and is used for ornamentation or as a gemstone. It can be highly polished and is used for items such as vases, seals, and snuff boxes. The density of jasper is typically 2.5 to 2.9\u00a0g/cm3. Jaspillite is a banded-iron-formation rock that often has distinctive bands of jasper.\nEtymology and history.\nThe name means \"spotted or speckled stone,\" and is derived via Old French (variant of Anglo-Norman \"jaspe\") and Latin (nom. ) from Greek \u1f34\u03b1\u03c3\u03c0\u03b9\u03c2 \"iaspis\" (feminine noun), from an Afroasiatic language (cf. Hebrew \"\" , Akkadian \"yashupu\"). This Semitic etymology is believed to be unrelated to that of the English given name Jasper, which is of Persian origin, though the Persian word for the mineral jasper is also \"yashum\" ().\nGreen jasper was used to make bow drills in Mehrgarh between 4th and 5th millennium BC. Jasper is known to have been a favorite gem in the ancient world; its name can be traced back in Arabic, Persian, Hebrew, Assyrian, Greek and Latin. On Minoan Crete, jasper was carved to produce seals circa 1800\u00a0BC, as evidenced by archaeological recoveries at the palace of Knossos.\nAlthough the term jasper is now restricted to opaque quartz, the ancient \"iaspis\" was a stone of considerable translucency including nephrite. The jasper of antiquity was in many cases distinctly green, for in ancient documents it is often compared to emerald and other green objects. Jasper is referred to in the \"Nibelungenlied\" as being clear and green. The jasper of the ancients probably included stones which would now be classed as chalcedony, and the emerald-like jasper may have been akin to the modern chrysoprase. The Hebrew word may have designated a green jasper. Flinders Petrie suggested that the \"odem\" \u2013 the first stone on the High Priest's breastplate \u2013 was a red jasper, whilst \"tarshish\", the tenth stone, may have been a yellow jasper.\nTypes.\nJasper is an opaque rock of virtually any colour stemming from the mineral content of the original sediments or ash. Patterns arise during the consolidation process forming flow and depositional patterns in the original silica-rich sediment or volcanic ash. Hydrothermal circulation is generally thought to be required in the formation of jasper.\nJasper can be modified by the diffusion of minerals along discontinuities providing the appearance of vegetative growth, i.e., dendritic. The original materials are often fractured and/or distorted, after deposition, into diverse patterns, which are later filled in with other colorful minerals. Weathering, with time, will create intensely colored superficial rinds.\nThe classification and naming of jasper varieties presents a challenge. Terms attributed to various well-defined materials includes the geographic locality where it is found, sometimes quite restricted such as \"Bruneau\" (a canyon) and \"Lahontan\" (a lake), rivers and even individual mountains; many are fanciful, such as \"forest fire\" or \"rainbow\", while others are descriptive, such as \"autumn\" or \"porcelain\". A few are designated by the place of origin such as a brown Egyptian or red African.\nBanded iron formations.\nJasper is the main component in the silica-rich parts of banded iron formations (BIFs) which indicate low, but present, amounts of dissolved oxygen in the water such as during the Great Oxidation Event or Snowball Earth. The red bands are microcrystalline red chert, also called jasper.\nPicture jaspers.\nPicture jaspers exhibit combinations of patterns resulting in what appear to be scenes or images, when seen on a cut section. Such patterns include banding from flow or depositional patterns (from water or wind), as well as dendritic or color variations. Diffusion from a center produces a distinctive orbicular appearance, i.e., leopard skin jasper or linear banding from a fracture as seen in liesegang jasper. Healed, fragmented rock produces brecciated (broken) jasper.\nWhile these \"picture jaspers\" can be found all over the world, specific colors or patterns are unique to the geographic region from which they originate. One source of the stone is Indonesia, especially in Purbalingga district. From the US, Oregon's Biggs jasper and Idaho's Bruneau jasper from the Bruneau River canyon are particularly fine examples. Other examples can be seen at Ynys Llanddwyn in Wales. A blue-green jasper occurs in a deposit at Ettutkan Mountain, Staryi Sibay, Bashkortostan, Russia. (The town of Sibay, in the far south of the Ural Mountains, near the border with Kazakhstan, is noted for its colossal, open-cast copper mine.)\nBasanite and other types of touchstone.\nBasanite is a deep velvety-black variety of amorphous quartz, of a slightly tougher and finer grain than jasper, and less splintery than hornstone. It was the \"Lydian stone\" or \"touchstone\" of the ancients. It is mentioned and its use described in the writings of Bacchylides about 450\u00a0BC, and was also described by Theophrastus in his book \"On Stones\" (Ancient Greek title: \u03a0\u03b5\u03c1\u1f76 \u03bb\u03af\u03b8\u03c9\u03bd: \"Peri Lithon\"), a century later. It is evident that the touchstone that Pliny had in mind when he wrote about it was merely a dense variety of basalt.\nBasanite (not to be confused with bassanite), \"Lydian stone\", and radiolarite (a.k.a. lydite or flinty slate) are terms used to refer to several types of black, jasper-like rock (also including tuffs, cherts and siltstones) which are dense, fine-grained and flinty / cherty in texture and found in a number of localities. The \"Lydian Stone\" known to the Ancient Greeks is named for the ancient kingdom of Lydia in what is now western Turkey. A similar rock type occurs in New England. Such rock types have long been used for the making of touchstones to test the purity of precious metal alloys, because they are hard enough to scratch such metals, which, if drawn (scraped) across them, show to advantage their metallic streaks of various (diagnostic) colours, against the dark background. There are, confusingly, not one but two rocks called basanite, one being a black form of jasper and the other a black volcanic rock closely akin to basalt. Add to this the fact that many different rock types \u2013 having in common the colour black and a fine texture \u2013 have, over the ages, been pressed into service as touchstones and it will be seen that there is ample scope for confusion in this petrology- and mineralogy-related field of study.\nFootnotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Courts may also be established by constitution or an equivalent constituting instrument.\nThe practical authority given to the court is known as its jurisdiction, which describes the court's power to decide certain kinds of questions, or petitions put to it. There are various kinds of courts, including trial courts, appellate courts, administrative courts, international courts, and tribunals.\nDescription.\nA court is any person or institution, often as a government institution, with the authority to adjudicate legal disputes between parties and carry out the administration of justice in civil, criminal, and administrative matters in accordance with the rule of law. In both common law and civil law legal systems, courts are the central means for dispute resolution, and it is generally understood that all people have an ability to bring their claims before a court. Similarly, the rights of those accused of a crime include the right to present a defense before a court.\nThe system of courts that interprets and applies the law is collectively known as the judiciary. The place where a court sits is known as a venue. The room where court proceedings occur is known as a courtroom, and the building as a courthouse; court facilities range from simple and very small facilities in rural communities to large complex facilities in urban communities.\nThe practical authority given to the court is known as its jurisdiction (from Latin , from , \"of the law\", + , \"to declare\", + , \"noun-forming suffix\"), the court's power to decide certain kinds of questions or petitions put to it. According to William Blackstone's \"Commentaries on the Laws of England,\" a court (for civil wrongs) is constituted by a minimum of three parties: the or plaintiff, who complains of an injury done; the or defendant, who is called upon to make satisfaction for it; and the or judicial power, who is to examine the truth of the fact, determine the law arising upon that fact, and, if any injury appears to have been done, ascertain and by its officers apply a legal remedy. It is also usual in the superior courts to have barristers, and attorneys or counsel, as assistants, though, often, courts consist of additional barristers, bailiffs, reporters, and perhaps a jury.\nEtymology.\nThe word \"court\" comes from the French , an enclosed yard, which derives from the Latin form , the accusative case of , which again means an enclosed yard or the occupants of such a yard. The English word \"court\" is thus a descendant of the Latin word from Ancient Greek () (meaning \"garden\", hence horticulture and orchard), both referring to an enclosed space.\nThe meaning of a judicial assembly is first attested in the 12th century, and derives from the earlier usage to designate a sovereign and his entourage, which met to adjudicate disputes in such an enclosed yard. The verb \"to court\", meaning to win favor, derives from the same source since people traveled to the sovereign's court to win his favor.\nThe term \"the court\" is used to refer to the presiding officer or officials, usually one or more judges. The judge or panel of judges may also be collectively referred to as \"the bench\" (in contrast to attorneys and barristers, collectively referred to as \"the bar\"). In the United States, the legal authority of a court to take action is based on personal jurisdiction over the parties to the litigation and subject-matter jurisdiction over the claims asserted.\nThe system of courts that interprets and applies the law is collectively known as the \"judiciary\". The place where a court sits is known as a \"venue\". The room where court proceedings occur is known as a \"courtroom\", and the building as a \"courthouse\"; court facilities range from simple and very small facilities in rural communities to large complex facilities in urban communities.\nJurisdiction.\nThe practical authority given to the court is known as its jurisdiction (from Latin , from , \"of the law\", + , \"to declare\", + , \"noun-forming suffix\"), the court's power to decide certain kinds of questions or petitions put to it. According to William Blackstone's \"Commentaries on the Laws of England,\" a court (for civil wrongs) is constituted by a minimum of three parties: the or plaintiff, who complains of an injury done; the or defendant, who is called upon to make satisfaction for it; and the or judicial power, who is to examine the truth of the fact, determine the law arising upon that fact, and, if any injury appears to have been done, ascertain and by its officers apply a legal remedy. It is also usual in the superior courts to have barristers, and attorneys or counsel, as assistants, though, often, courts consist of additional barristers, bailiffs, reporters, and perhaps a jury. \"Jurisdiction\" is defined as the official authority to make legal decisions and judgements over a person or material item within a territory.\n\"Whether a given court has jurisdiction to preside over a given case\" is a key question in any legal action. Three basic components of jurisdiction are personal jurisdiction over an individual or thing (), jurisdiction over the particular subject matter (subject-matter jurisdiction) and territorial jurisdiction. Jurisdiction over a person refers to the full authority over a person regardless of where they live, jurisdiction over a particular subject matter refers to the authority over the said subject of legal cases involved in a case, and lastly territorial jurisdiction is the authority over a person within an x amount of space.\nOther concepts of jurisdiction include general, exclusive, appellate, and (in the United States federal courts) diversity jurisdiction.\nTypes and organization of courts.\nCourts may be organized into a hierarchy of courts and have specific jurisdiction and include specialized courts.\nTrial and appellate courts.\nTrial courts are courts that hold trials. Sometimes termed \"courts of first instance\", trial courts have varying original jurisdiction. Trial courts may conduct trials with juries as the finders of fact (these are known as jury trials) or trials in which judges act as both finders of fact and finders of law (in some jurisdictions these are known as bench trials). Juries are less common in court systems outside the Anglo-American common law tradition.\nAppellate courts are courts that hear appeals of lower courts and trial courts.\nSome courts, such as the Crown Court in England and Wales, may have both trial and appellate jurisdictions.\nCivil law courts and common law courts.\nThe two major legal traditions of the western world are the civil law courts and the common law courts. These two great legal traditions are similar, in that they are products of western culture, although there are significant differences between the two traditions. Civil law courts are profoundly based upon Roman law, specifically a civil body of law entitled . This theory of civil law was rediscovered around the end of the eleventh century and became a foundation for university legal education starting in Bologna, Italy and subsequently being taught throughout continental European universities.\nCivil law is firmly ensconced in the French and German legal systems. Common law courts were established by English royal judges of the King's Council after the Norman Invasion of Britain in 1066. The royal judges created a body of law by combining local customs they were made aware of through traveling and visiting local jurisdictions. This common standard of law became known as \"Common Law\". This legal tradition is practiced in the English and American legal systems. In most civil law jurisdictions, courts function under an inquisitorial system. In the common law system, most courts follow the adversarial system. Procedural law governs the rules by which courts operate: civil procedure for private disputes (for example); and criminal procedure for violation of the criminal law. In recent years, international courts are being created to resolve matters not covered by the jurisdiction of national courts. For example, the International Criminal Court, based in The Hague, in the Netherlands, or the Court of Permanent Lok Adalat (Public Utility Services), based in India.\nList of types and organization of courts.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nCourt television shows.\nTelevision show courts, which are often not part of the judicial system and are generally private arbitrators, are depicted within the court show genre; however, the courts depicted have been criticized as misrepresenting real-life courts of law and the true nature of the legal system.

{"id": "75359", "revid": "50197585", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=75359", "title": "Gender neutrality in English", "text": "Linguistic feature in the English language\nGender-neutral language is language that avoids assumptions about the social gender or biological sex of people referred to in speech or writing. In contrast to most other Indo-European languages, English does not retain grammatical gender and most of its nouns, adjectives and pronouns are therefore not gender-specific. In most other Indo-European languages, nouns are grammatically masculine (as in Spanish \"el humano\") or grammatically feminine (as in French \"la personne\"), or grammatically neuter (as in German \"das M\u00e4dchen\"), regardless of the actual gender of the referent.\nIn addressing natural gender, English speakers use linguistic strategies that may reflect the speaker's attitude to the issue or the perceived social acceptability of such strategies.\nDebate.\nSupporters of gender-neutral language argue that making language less biased is not only laudable but also achievable. Some people find the use of non-neutral language to be offensive.\n[There is] a growing awareness that language does not merely reflect the way we think: it also shapes our thinking. If words and expressions that imply that women are inferior to men are constantly used, that assumption of inferiority tends to become part of our mindset... Language is a powerful tool: poets and propagandists know this \u2013 as, indeed, do victims of discrimination.\nThe standards advocated by supporters of the gender-neutral modification in English have been applied differently and to differing degrees among English speakers worldwide. This reflects differences in culture and language structure, for example American English in contrast to British English.\nSupport for.\nSupporters of gender-neutral language argue that the use of gender-specific language often implies male superiority or reflects an unequal state of society. According to \"The Handbook of English Linguistics\", generic masculine pronouns and gender-specific job titles are instances \"where English linguistic convention has historically treated men as prototypical of the human species.\" That masculine forms are used to represent all human beings is in accord with the traditional gender hierarchy, which grants men more power and higher social status than women.\nSupporters also argue that words that refer to women often devolve in meaning, frequently developing sexual overtones.\n\"The Handbook of Nonsexist Writing\" says that the words children hear affect their perceptions of the gender-appropriateness of certain careers (e.g. firemen vs firefighters). Men and women apply for jobs in more equal proportions when gender-neutral language is used in the advertisement, as opposed to the generic \"he\" or \"man\". Some critics claim that these differences in usage are not accidental, but have been deliberately created for the purpose of upholding a patriarchal society.\nOpposition.\nVarious criticisms have been leveled against the use of gender-neutral language, most focusing on specific usages, such as the use of \"human\" instead of \"man\" and \"they\" instead of \"he\". Opponents argue that the use of any other forms of language other than gender-specific language could \"lead one into using awkward or grating constructions\" or neologisms that are so ugly as to be \"abominations\".\nOpponents of gender-neutral language often argue that its proponents are impinging on the right of free expression and promoting censorship, as well as being overly accommodating to the sensitivities of a minority. A few commentators do not disagree with the usage of gender-neutral language, but they do question the effectiveness of gender-neutral language in overcoming sexism.\nIn religion.\nMuch debate over the use of gender-neutral language surrounds questions of liturgy and Bible translation. Some translations of the Bible in recent years have used gender-inclusive pronouns, but these translations have not been universally accepted.\nNaming practices.\nSome critics oppose the practice of women changing their names upon marriage, on the grounds that it makes women historically invisible: \"In our society 'only men have real names' in that their names are permanent and they have 'accepted the permanency of their names as one of the rights of being male.'... Essentially this practice means that women's family names do not count and that there is one more device for making women invisible.\" Up until the 1970s, as women were granted greater access to professions, they would be less likely to change their names, either professionally or legally; names were seen as tied to reputations and women were less likely to change their names when they had higher reputations. However, that trend was reversed starting in the 1970s; since that time, increasingly more women have been taking their husband's surname upon marriage, especially among well-educated women in high-earning occupations. Increasingly, studies have shown women's decisions on the issue are guided by factors other than political or religious ideas about women's rights or marital roles, as often believed.\nThe practice of referring to married women by their husband's first and last names, which only died out in the late 20th century, has been criticized since the 19th century. When the Reverend Samuel May \"moved that Mrs Stephen Smith be placed on a Committee\" of the National Women's Rights Convention in Seneca Falls, Lucretia Mott quickly replied: \"Woman's Rights' women do not like to be called by their husbands' names, but by their own\". Elizabeth Cady Stanton refused to be addressed as \"Mrs Henry B. Stanton\". The practice was developed in the mid-18th century and was tied to the idea of coverture, the idea that \"By marriage, the husband and wife are one person in law; that is, the very being or legal existence of the woman is suspended during the marriage.\"\nThere is a tendency among scientists to refer to women by their first and last name and to men by their last name only. This may result in female scientists being perceived as less eminent than their male colleagues.\nExamples of gender-neutral language.\nJob titles.\nGender-neutral job titles do not specify the gender of the person referred to, particularly when the gender is not in fact known, or is not yet specified (as in job advertisements). Examples include \"firefighter\" instead of \"fireman\"; \"flight attendant\" instead of \"steward\" or \"stewardess\"; \"bartender\" instead of \"barman\" or \"barmaid\"; and \"chairperson\" or \"chair\" instead of \"chairman\" or \"chairwoman\".\nThere are also cases where a distinct female form exists, but the basic (or \"male\") form does not intrinsically indicate a male (such as by including \"man\"), and can equally well be applied to any member of the profession, whether male or female or of unspecified sex. Examples include \"actor\" and \"actress\"; \"usher\" and \"usherette\"; \"comedian\" and \"comedienne\". In such cases, proponents of gender-neutral language generally advocate the non-use of the distinct female form (always using \"comedian\" rather than \"comedienne\", for example, even if the referent is known to be a woman).\nTerms such as \"male nurse\", \"male model\" or \"female judge\" are sometimes used in cases where the gender is irrelevant or already understood (as in \"my brother is a male nurse\"). Many advisors on non-sexist usage discourage such phrasing, as it implies that someone of that gender is an inferior or atypical member of the profession. Another discouraged form is the prefixing of an ordinary job title with \"lady\", as in \"lady doctor\": here \"woman\" or \"female\" is preferred if it is necessary to specify the gender. Some jobs are known colloquially with a gender marker: washerwoman or laundress (now usually referred to as a laundry worker), tea lady (formerly in offices, still in hospitals), lunch lady (American English) or dinner lady (British English), cleaning lady for cleaner (formerly known as a charwoman or charlady), and so on.\nGeneric words for humans.\nAnother issue for gender-neutral language concerns the use of the words \"man\", \"men\" and \"mankind\" to refer to a person or people of unspecified sex or to persons of both sexes.\nAlthough the word \"man\" originally referred to both males and females, some feel that it no longer does so unambiguously. In Old English, the word \"wer\" referred to males only and \"wif\" to females only, while \"man\" referred to both, although in practice \"man\" was sometimes also used in Old English to refer only to males. In time, \"wer\" fell out of use, and \"man\" came to refer sometimes to both sexes and sometimes to males only; \"[a]s long as most generalizations about men were made by men about men, the ambiguity nestling in this dual usage was either not noticed or thought not to matter.\" By the 18th century, \"man\" had come to refer primarily to males; some writers who wished to use the term in the older sense deemed it necessary to spell out their meaning. Anthony Trollope, for example, writes of \"the infinite simplicity and silliness of mankind and womankind\", and when \"Edmund Burke, writing of the French Revolution, used \"men\" in the old, inclusive way, he took pains to spell out his meaning: 'Such a deplorable havoc is made in the minds of men (both sexes) in France...'\"\nProponents of gender-neutral language argue that seemingly generic uses of the word \"man\" are often not in fact generic. Miller and Swift illustrate with the following quotation:\nAs for man, he is no different from the rest. His back aches, he ruptures easily, his women have difficulties in childbirth...\n\"If \"man\" and \"he\" were truly generic, the parallel phrase would have been \"he has difficulties in childbirth\"\", Miller and Swift comment. Writing for the American Philosophical Association, Virginia L. Warren follows Janice Moulton and suggests truly generic uses of the word \"man\" would be perceived as \"false, funny, or insulting\", offering as an example the sentence \"Some men are female.\"\nFurther, some commentators point out that the ostensibly gender-neutral use of \"man\" has in fact sometimes been used to exclude women:\nThomas Jefferson did not make the same distinction in declaring that \"all men are created equal\" and \"governments are instituted among men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed.\" In a time when women, having no vote, could neither give nor withhold consent, Jefferson had to be using the word \"men\" in its principal sense of \"males\", and it probably never occurred to him that anyone would think otherwise.\nFor reasons like those above, supporters of gender-neutral language argue that linguistic clarity as well as equality would be better served by having \"man\" and \"men\" refer unambiguously to males, and \"human(s)\" or \"people\" to all persons; similarly, the word \"mankind\" replaced by \"humankind\" or \"humanity\".\nThe use of the word \"man\" as a generic word referring to all humans has been declining, particularly among female speakers and writers.\nPronouns.\nAnother target of frequent criticism by proponents of gender-neutral language is the use of the masculine pronoun \"he\" (and its derived forms \"him\", \"his\" and \"himself\") to refer to antecedents of indeterminate gender. Although this usage is traditional, some critics argue that it was invented and propagated by males, whose explicit goal was the linguistic representation of male superiority. The use of the generic \"he\" was approved in an Act of Parliament, the Interpretation Act 1850 (the provision continues in the Interpretation Act 1978, although this states equally that the feminine includes the masculine). On the other hand, in 1879 the word \"he\" in by-laws was used to block admission of women to the Massachusetts Medical Society.\nProposed alternatives to the generic \"he\" include \"he or she\" (or \"she or he\"), \"s/he\", or the use of singular \"they\". Each of these alternatives has met with objections. The use of \"he or she\" has been criticized for reinforcing the gender binary. Some see the use of singular \"they\" to be a grammatical error, but according to most references, \"they\", \"their\" and \"them\" have long been grammatically acceptable as gender-neutral singular pronouns in English, having been used in the singular continuously since the Middle Ages, including by a number of prominent authors, such as Geoffrey Chaucer, William Shakespeare, and Jane Austen. Linguist Steven Pinker goes further and argues that traditional grammar proscriptions regarding the use of singular \"they\" are themselves incorrect:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The logical point that you, Holden Caulfield, and everyone but the language mavens intuitively grasp is that \"everyone\" and \"they\" are not an \"antecedent\" and a \"pronoun\" referring to the same person in the world, which would force them to agree in number. They are a \"quantifier\" and a \"bound variable\", a different logical relationship. Everyone returned to their seats means \"For all X, X returned to X's seat.\" The \"X\" does not refer to any particular person or group of people; it is simply a placeholder that keeps track of the roles that players play across different relationships. In this case, the X that comes back to a seat is the same X that owns the seat that X comes back to. The \"their\" there does not, in fact, have plural number, because it refers neither to one thing nor to many things; it does not refer at all.\nSome style guides (e.g. APA) accept singular \"they\" as grammatically correct, while others reject it. Some, such as \"The Chicago Manual of Style\", hold a neutral position on the issue, and contend that any approach used is likely to displease some readers.\nResearch has found that the use of masculine pronouns in a generic sense creates \"male bias\" by evoking a disproportionate number of male images and excluding thoughts of women in non-sex specific instances. Moreover, a study by John Gastil found that while \"they\" functions as a generic pronoun for both males and females, males may comprehend \"he/she\" in a manner similar to \"he\".\nHonorifics.\nProponents of gender-neutral language point out that while Mr is used for men regardless of marital status, the titles Miss and Mrs indicate a woman's marital status, and thus signal her sexual availability in a way that men's titles do not. The honorific \"Ms\" can be used for women regardless of marital status.\nThe gender-neutral honorific Mx (usually \"mix\", ) can be used in place of gendered honorifics to provide gender neutrality. Adoption of the honorific has been relatively rapid and thorough in the UK. In 2013, Brighton and Hove City Council in Sussex, England, voted to allow its use on council forms, and in 2014, The Royal Bank of Scotland included the title as an option. In 2015, recognition spread more broadly across UK institutions, including the Royal Mail, government agencies responsible for documents such as drivers' licenses, and several other major banks. In 2015, it was included in the \"Oxford English Dictionary\".\nStyle guidance by publishers and others.\nMany editing houses, corporations, and government bodies have official policies in favor of in-house use of gender-neutral language. One of the first was \"The Handbook of Nonsexist Writing: For writers, editors, and speakers\", published in 1980; linguist Deborah Cameron argues that the work by Casey Miller and Kate Swift brought \"the issue of sexist language into the mainstream\".\nIn some cases, laws exist regarding the use of gender-neutral language in certain situations, such as job advertisements. Different authorities have presented guidelines on whether and how to use gender-neutral, or \"non-sexist\" language. Several are listed below:\nIn addition, gender-neutral language has gained support from some major textbook publishers, and from professional and academic groups such as the American Psychological Association and the Associated Press. Newspapers such as the \"New York Times\" and the \"Wall Street Journal\" use gender-neutral language. Many law journals, psychology journals, and literature journals will only print articles or papers that use gender-inclusive language.\nEmployee policy manuals sometimes include strongly worded statements prescribing avoidance of language that potentially could be considered discriminatory. One such example is from the University of Saskatchewan: \"All documents, publications or presentations developed by all constituencies...\"shall be written\" in gender neutral and/or gender inclusive language.\"\nIn 1989 the American Bar Association's House of Delegates adopted a resolution stating that \"the American Bar Association and each of its entities should use gender-neutral language in all documents establishing policy and procedure.\"\nIn 2015 the Union for Reform Judaism in North America passed a \"Resolution on the Rights of Transgender and Gender Non-Conforming People\" stating in part: \"THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED THAT the Union for Reform Judaism...[u]rges Reform Movement institutions to review their use of language in prayers, forms and policies in an effort to ensure people of all gender identities and gender expressions are welcomed, included, accepted and respected. This includes developing statements of inclusion and/or non-discrimination policies pertaining to gender identity and gender expression, the use when feasible of gender-neutral language, and offering more than two gender options or eliminating the need to select a gender on forms\".\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

In particular, the viscosity of non-Newtonian fluids can change when subjected to force. Ketchup, for example, becomes runnier when shaken and is thus a non-Newtonian fluid. Many salt solutions and molten polymers are non-Newtonian fluids, as are many commonly found substances such as custard, toothpaste, starch suspensions, paint, blood, melted butter and shampoo.\nMost commonly, the viscosity (the gradual deformation by shear or tensile stresses) of non-Newtonian fluids is dependent on shear rate or shear rate history. Some non-Newtonian fluids with shear-independent viscosity, however, still exhibit normal stress-differences or other non-Newtonian behavior. In a Newtonian fluid, the relation between the shear stress and the shear rate is linear, passing through the origin, the constant of proportionality being the coefficient of viscosity. In a non-Newtonian fluid, the relation between the shear stress and the shear rate is different. The fluid can even exhibit time-dependent viscosity. Therefore, a constant coefficient of viscosity cannot be defined.\nAlthough the concept of viscosity is commonly used in fluid mechanics to characterize the shear properties of a fluid, it can be inadequate to describe non-Newtonian fluids. They are best studied through several other rheological properties that relate stress and strain rate tensors under many different flow conditions\u2014such as oscillatory shear or extensional flow\u2014which are measured using different devices or rheometers. The properties are better studied using tensor-valued constitutive equations, which are common in the field of continuum mechanics.\nFor non-Newtonian fluid's viscosity, there are pseudoplastic, plastic, and dilatant flows that are time-independent, and there are thixotropic and rheopectic flows that are time-dependent. Three well-known time-dependent non-newtonian fluids which can be identified by the defining authors are the Oldroyd-B model, Walters\u2019 Liquid B and Williamson fluids.\nTime-dependent self-similar analysis of the Ladyzenskaya-type model with a non-linear velocity dependent stress tensor was performed. No analytical solutions could be derived, but a rigorous mathematical existence theorem was given for the solution.\nFor time-independent non-Newtonian fluids the known analytic solutions are much broader.\nTypes of non-Newtonian behavior.\nShear thickening fluid.\nThe viscosity of a shear thickening\u00a0\u2013 i.e. dilatant\u00a0\u2013 fluid appears to increase when the shear rate increases. Corn starch suspended in water (\"oobleck\", see below) is a common example: when stirred slowly it looks milky, when stirred vigorously it feels like a very viscous liquid.\nShear thinning fluid.\nA familiar example of the opposite, a shear thinning fluid, or pseudoplastic fluid, is wall paint: The paint should flow readily off the brush when it is being applied to a surface but not drip excessively. Note that all thixotropic fluids are extremely shear thinning, but they are significantly time dependent, whereas the colloidal \"shear thinning\" fluids respond instantaneously to changes in shear rate. Thus, to avoid confusion, the latter classification is more clearly termed pseudoplastic.\nAnother example of a shear thinning fluid is blood. This application is highly favoured within the body, as it allows the viscosity of blood to decrease with increased shear strain rate.\nBingham plastic.\nFluids that have a linear shear stress/shear strain relationship but require a finite yield stress before they begin to flow (the plot of shear stress against shear strain does not pass through the origin) are called Bingham plastics. Several examples are clay suspensions, drilling mud, toothpaste, mayonnaise, chocolate, and mustard. The surface of a Bingham plastic can hold peaks when it is still. By contrast Newtonian fluids have flat featureless surfaces when still.\nRheopectic or anti-thixotropic.\nThere are also fluids whose strain rate is a function of time. Fluids that require a gradually increasing shear stress to maintain a constant strain rate are referred to as rheopectic. An opposite case of this is a fluid that thins out with time and requires a decreasing stress to maintain a constant strain rate (thixotropic).\nExamples.\nMany common substances exhibit non-Newtonian flows. These include:\nOobleck.\nAn inexpensive, non-toxic example of a non-Newtonian fluid is a suspension of starch (e.g., cornstarch/cornflour) in water, sometimes called \"oobleck\", \"ooze\", or \"magic mud\" (1 part of water to 1.5\u20132 parts of corn starch). The name \"oobleck\" is derived from the Dr. Seuss book \"Bartholomew and the Oobleck\".\nBecause of its dilatant properties, oobleck is often used in demonstrations that exhibit its unusual behavior. A person may walk on a large tub of oobleck without sinking due to its shear thickening properties, as long as the individual moves quickly enough to provide enough force with each step to cause the thickening. Also, if oobleck is placed on a large subwoofer driven at a sufficiently high volume, it will thicken and form standing waves in response to low frequency sound waves from the speaker. If a person were to punch or hit oobleck, it would thicken and act like a solid. After the blow, the oobleck will go back to its thin liquid-like state.\nFlubber (slime).\nFlubber, also commonly known as slime, is a non-Newtonian fluid, easily made from polyvinyl acetate\u2013based glues (such as white \"school\" glue) and borax. It flows under low stresses but breaks under higher stresses and pressures. This combination of fluid-like and solid-like properties makes it a Maxwell fluid. Its behaviour can also be described as being viscoplastic or gelatinous.\nChilled caramel topping.\nAnother example of non-Newtonian fluid flow is chilled caramel ice cream topping (so long as it incorporates hydrocolloids such as carrageenan and gellan gum). The sudden application of force\u2014by stabbing the surface with a finger, for example, or rapidly inverting the container holding it\u2014causes the fluid to behave like a solid rather than a liquid. This is the \"shear thickening\" property of this non-Newtonian fluid. More gentle treatment, such as slowly inserting a spoon, will leave it in its liquid state. Trying to jerk the spoon back out again, however, will trigger the return of the temporary solid state.\nSilly Putty.\nSilly Putty is a silicone polymer based suspension that will flow, bounce, or break, depending on strain rate.\nPlant resin.\nPlant resin is a viscoelastic solid polymer. When left in a container, it will flow slowly as a liquid to conform to the contours of its container. If struck with greater force, however, it will shatter as a solid.\nQuicksand.\nQuicksand is a shear thinning non-Newtonian colloid that gains viscosity at rest. Quicksand's non-Newtonian properties can be observed when it experiences a slight shock (for example, when someone walks on it or agitates it with a stick), shifting between its gel and sol phase and seemingly liquefying, causing objects on the surface of the quicksand to sink.\nKetchup.\nKetchup is a shear thinning fluid. Shear thinning means that the fluid viscosity decreases with increasing shear stress. In other words, fluid motion is initially difficult at slow rates of deformation, but will flow more freely at high rates. Shaking an inverted bottle of ketchup can cause it to transition to a lower viscosity through shear thinning, making it easier to pour from the bottle.\nDry granular flows.\nUnder certain circumstances, flows of granular materials can be modelled as a continuum, for example using the \"\u03bc\"(\"I\") rheology. Such continuum models tend to be non-Newtonian, since the apparent viscosity of granular flows increases with pressure and decreases with shear rate. The main difference is the shearing stress and rate of shear.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

From September 1941 until August 1942, he served as the first commandant of the Majdanek concentration camp in occupied Poland, stealing vast amounts of valuables and money from murdered Jews. His wife, Ilse Koch, also participated in the crimes at Buchenwald.\nLife.\nKoch was born in Darmstadt, Grand Duchy of Hesse-Darmstadt, on 2 August 1897. His father worked in a local registrar's office and died when Karl was eight years old. After completing elementary school in 1912, Koch attended Mittelschule and completed a commercial apprenticeship.\nIn 1916, he volunteered to join the Imperial German Army and fought on the Western Front until he was captured by the British. Koch spent the rest of the war as a prisoner of war and returned to Germany in 1919. As a soldier, he behaved well and was awarded the Iron Cross Second Class, the Observer's Badge and the Wound Badge in Black. After World War I, Koch worked as a commercial manager, an authorized signatory and insurance agent and became unemployed in 1932 (he had served a prison sentence in 1930 for embezzlement and forgery). In 1931, he joined the Nazi Party and the \"Schutzstaffel\" (SS).\nService with the SS.\nKoch served with several \"SS-Standarten\" (Thirty-fifth SS Regiment Kassel, SS Special Detachment Saxony). In 1934, he took command of the Sachsenburg Concentration Camp. Briefly, he was the officer in charge of the Esterwegen Concentration Camp guard unit, officer in charge of the preventive custody camp in the Lichtenburg Concentration Camp, and the adjutant at Dachau Concentration Camp. On 13 June 1935, he became commander of the Columbia concentration camp in Berlin-Tempelhof and, in April 1936, he was assigned to the concentration camp at Esterwegen. Four months later, he was assigned to the Sachsenhausen concentration camp. By September 1937 he had advanced to SS-Standartenf\u00fchrer (colonel).\nOn 1 August 1937, he was given command of the new Buchenwald concentration camp. He remained at Buchenwald until September 1941, when he was transferred to the Majdanek concentration camp for POWs near Lublin, Poland. That was due largely to an investigation based on allegations of his improper behavior at Buchenwald, which included corruption, fraud, embezzlement, drunkenness, sexual offences and a murder. Koch commanded the Majdanek camp for only one year; he was relieved from his duties when 86 Soviet POWs escaped from the camp in August 1942. Koch was charged with criminal negligence and transferred to Berlin, where he worked at the SS Personnel Main Office and as a liaison between the SS and the German Post Office.\nProsecution and death.\nKoch's actions at Buchenwald first caught the attention of SS-Obergruppenf\u00fchrer Josias, Hereditary Prince of Waldeck and Pyrmont, in 1941. While perusing the death list of Buchenwald, Hereditary Prince Josias had seen the name of Walter Kr\u00e4mer, a head hospital orderly at Buchenwald, which he recognized because Kr\u00e4mer had successfully treated him in the past. Hereditary Prince Josias investigated the case and found that Koch, as the Camp Commandant, had ordered Kr\u00e4mer and Karl Peix, a hospital attendant, killed as \"political prisoners\" because they had treated him for syphilis and he feared it might be discovered. Josias also received reports that a certain prisoner had been shot while attempting to escape, and discovered that in fact, the prisoner had been told to get water from a well some distance from the camp, then was shot from behind; he had also helped treat Koch for syphilis.\nBy that time, Koch had been transferred to the Majdanek concentration camp in Poland, but his wife, Ilse, was still living at the Commandant's house in Buchenwald. Josias ordered a full-scale investigation of the camp by Georg Konrad Morgen, an SS officer who was an SS-judge in the SS Court Main Office. As a result of the investigation, more of Koch's orders to kill prisoners at the camp were revealed, as well as embezzlement of property stolen from prisoners. The Kochs had used the massive Nazi apparatus to gain an enormous amount of wealth. The Kochs were both arrested in August 1943 to await trial by an SS court.\nSS Judge Konrad Morgen formally indicted the Kochs on 17 August 1944, charging Karl Koch with the \"embezzlement and concealing of funds and goods in an amount of at least 200,000 RM,\" and the \"premeditated murder\" of three inmates\u2014ostensibly to prevent them from giving evidence to the SS investigatory commission. Ilse was charged with the \"habitual receiving of stolen goods, and taking for her benefit at least 25,000 RM\". \nThe trial resulted in Koch being sentenced to death for disgracing both himself and the SS. Koch was executed by firing squad on 5 April 1945 one week before American allied troops arrived to liberate the camp. \nContrary to some claims, however, Karl's body was not burned in the camp's crematoria, as they had run short of coal and had stopped operating in mid-March 1945. Instead, his body was disposed of in an unknown location.\nFamily.\nKoch first married K\u00e4te M\u00fcller in 1924 and had one psychiatrically troubled son named Manfred; however, this marriage ended with divorce in 1931 due to his infidelity. On 25 May 1937, Koch married Ilse Koch (n\u00e9e Margarete Ilse K\u00f6hler), with whom he had a son and two daughters. Ilse became known later as \"The Witch of Buchenwald\" (\"Die Hexe von Buchenwald\"), usually rendered in English as \"The Bitch of Buchenwald.\" Though Ilse Koch never had any official job at Buchenwald or at any other concentration camp, many inmates alleged that she used the tacit authority she had as the commandant's wife to abuse prisoners, or seek their punishment by the camp SS.\nPhoto album of Sachsenhausen concentration camp.\nMore than 55 years after Koch's execution, a private photo album of his was discovered in the FSB archives in Moscow. Koch received the album from his co-workers as a gift for his 40th birthday. The album documents the construction process of the Sachsenhausen concentration camp. It consists of 460 photographs, including 200 neatly labeled photos \u2014 some with cynical remarks \u2014 of the creation of the camp in 1936 and 1937. The photos also depict the concentration camp personnel, and prisoners as they arrive in normal clothing and later appear for roll call with their heads shaved and dressed in prisoner uniforms.\nNotes and references.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

His father Mark Antony summoned Cleopatra to a summit near Antioch, Syria (now a part of modern Turkey) in a place Plutarch locates as being situated between Beirut and Sidon, called Light, an unwalled village. If Plutarch is to be believed, Ptolemy Philadelphus was conceived during this meeting between roughly November and December 37 BC. William Woodthorpe Tarn believed his birth (presumably in Alexandria, Egypt) was between August\u2013September 36 BC.\nPtolemy Philadelphus was named after the original Ptolemy II Philadelphus (the second Pharaoh of the Ptolemaic dynasty) and Cleopatra's intention was recreating the former Ptolemaic Kingdom, which she herself received from Antony in the Donations of Antioch in 36 BC at this time with full approval from Octavian. Two years later in late 34 BC, at the Donations of Alexandria, part of her kingdom was granted to Ptolemy Philadelphus making him ruler of Syria, Phoenicia and Cilicia.\nHaving approved of Antony's planned reorganization of the East in 36 BC, by 34 BC, their political situations had evolved and Octavian then used with potency the Donations of Alexandria in his propaganda war against Antony. Ultimately, the parents of Ptolemy Philadelphus were defeated by Caesar Octavian (future Emperor Augustus) during the naval battle at Actium, Greece in 31 BC. The next year, his parents committed suicide as Octavian's legions invaded Egypt. Their tombs have never been found or mentioned, and some ancient sources mention they might have escaped Octavian and fled to the way of India through Red sea where Caesarion was also possibly sent.\nCapture and fate.\nOctavian took him and his elder siblings Alexander Helios and Cleopatra Selene II from Egypt to Roman Italy (\"Italia\"). Octavian celebrated his military triumph by parading the three orphans in heavy golden chains in the streets of Rome. The chains were so heavy that they could not walk, prompting reactions of sympathy from the Romans. Octavian gave these siblings to Octavia Minor, his second-eldest sister who was their father's former wife.\nThe fate of Ptolemy Philadelphus is unknown. Plutarch states that the only child that Octavian killed out of Antony's children was Marcus Antonius Antyllus, but the ancient sources make no mention of him after being taken to Rome with his surviving siblings. His sister Cleopatra Selene survived to adulthood and was married to Juba of Mauretania, a client king of the Roman empire. Through her, the Ptolemaic line intermarried back into the Roman nobility for many generations. The only further mention of Alexander Helios and Ptolemy Philadelphus comes from Cassius Dio, who states that when their sister, Cleopatra Selene II, married King Juba II [25 BC], Octavian (by then named Augustus) spared the lives of Alexander Helios and Ptolemy Philadelphus as a favor to the couple. If Ptolemy Philadelphus survived to adulthood, proof of his survival has not been found. Roller speculates that he may have died from illness in the winter of 29 BC.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Col. Grant Morden (1880\u20131932). He added refinements such as a ballroom, a Victorian-style Turkish bath, and an indoor squash court. Due to its seclusion, it was used as a discreet meeting place for high-ranking politicians and diplomats; the agreement to create the Anglo-Irish Treaty was signed there.\nIn 1934, building tycoon Charles Boot (1874\u20131945) bought the land and turned it into a country club. The ballroom was converted into a restaurant and many of the bedrooms became furnished suites.\n1930s.\nIn 1935, millionaire flour magnate J. Arthur Rank (1888\u20131972) went into partnership with Boot and they transformed the estate into a film studio. Boot based designs for the studio complex on the latest ideas being employed by film studios in Hollywood, California. Boot named the new studio Pinewood because \"of the number of trees which grow there and because it seemed to suggest something of the American film centre in its second syllable\". Construction began in December of that year, with a new stage completed every three weeks. The studios were finished nine months later, having cost \u00a31\u00a0million (approx. \u00a3 at 2023 prices). Five stages were initially completed and there was provision for an enclosed water tank capable of holding , which is still in use. In the years that followed, he also undertook further work on both the Pinewood Film Studios and the Denham Film Studios, both of which had by then become a part of the newly-formed Rank Organisation.\nOn 30 September 1936, the studio complex was officially opened by Dr Leslie Burgin, Parliamentary Secretary to the Board of Trade. The first film director to use the facilities was Herbert Wilcox, completing \"London Melody\" (1937) featuring Anna Neagle (his wife), portions of which had already been filmed at British and Dominions Imperial Studios in Elstree, before a fire there halted production. The first film to be made entirely at Pinewood was \"Talk of the Devil\" (1936), directed by Carol Reed.\nThere followed a prolific period of Pinewood and British film history, with Pinewood following the studios adopting the \"unit system\", an American industry practice. That enabled several pictures to be filmed simultaneously and, ultimately, Pinewood achieved the highest output of any studio in the world.\n1940s.\nDuring the Second World War, Pinewood was requisitioned, and the Crown Film Unit, No. 5 Army Film and Photographic Unit, Royal Air Force Film Production Unit, and Polish Air Force Film Unit were based there. The Crown Film Unit completed many classic wartime documentaries, and Roy Boulting's \"Desert Victory\", Humphrey Jennings' \"Fires Were Started\", \"Coastal Command\" and Pat Jackson's \"Western Approaches\" (all 1943) were filmed there during that period. As well as its use by the armed forces, the Royal Mint and Lloyd's of London were installed on sound stages at Pinewood, and were open for business for the duration of the war.\nThe Company of Youth, the Rank Organisation acting school, which launched several film careers, was founded in 1945. The next year, Pinewood re-opened for (non-war-related) business.\nTwo significant films produced at Pinewood were released within two months of each other in 1948: \"Oliver Twist\", directed by David Lean, and Powell and Pressburger's \"The Red Shoes\". Due to a shortfall in funds, brought about by financial overspends the previous year, Rank did not have enough money to market \"The Red Shoes\" sufficiently at first in the US, but it became Rank's biggest earner up to that point, grossing over \u00a31\u00a0million by 1951 (the equivalent of \u00a3 in 2023 terms).\nIn the same year, John Davis was appointed managing director. By the following year, Rank had run up an overdraft of \u00a316\u00a0million (the equivalent of \u00a3 in 2023), and announced a loss of \u00a33.5 million, mainly due to big budget flops. One of the largest of these had been \"Caesar and Cleopatra\" (1945), which was originally budgeted at \u00a3250,000, but which eventually cost \u00a31,278,000 (the equivalent of \u00a3 in 2023).\n1950s.\nThe \"Doctor\" film series, produced by Betty Box and directed by Ralph Thomas, began with \"Doctor in the House\" (1954), the most successful film at the box-office of its year in Great Britain. All of the \"Doctor\" films, running until 1970, were shot at Pinewood. The \"Carry On\" franchise began in 1958, produced on behalf of Rank by Peter Rogers (who was married to Box), and directed by Gerald Thomas (brother of Ralph). The Norman Wisdom comedies, the last of which was released in 1966, were also filmed at the facility.\n1960s.\nDuring the 1960s, Pinewood was no longer solely dependent on the Rank Organisation to fill its stages. \"Renters\" (producers hiring the sound stages for a film-by-film agreement) were using half of the stages as Pinewood turned into a four walls facility. The James Bond franchise began at Pinewood with Terence Young directing \"Dr. No\" (1962), and has continued to be based at the studios since then.\nJ. Arthur Rank (by then Lord Rank) retired as chairman in 1962 and was succeeded by John Davis, who had begun to move the Rank Organisation away from mass film production and towards more profitable and less risky businesses such as bingo and holidays.\n1970s.\nDuring the 1970s, Pinewood studios were being used more for television programmes, including ITC Entertainment's \"UFO\" (1970), \"The Persuaders!\" (1971), starring Tony Curtis and Roger Moore, and \"\" (1975\u20131977). Major films shot at Pinewood included \"Fiddler on the Roof\" (1971), \"Sleuth\" (1972), \"The Day of the Jackal\" (1973), \"Superman\" (1978) and \"Superman II\" (1980), \"Alien\" (1979) and \"Bugsy Malone\" (1976), and the James Bond films \"Diamonds Are Forever\" (1971), \"Live and Let Die\" (1973), \"The Man with the Golden Gun\" (1974), and \"The Spy Who Loved Me\" (1977).\n1980s.\nFour James Bond movies, \"For Your Eyes Only\" (1981), \"Octopussy\" (1983), \"A View to a Kill\" (1985), and \"The Living Daylights\" (1987), among several other large productions, such as \"Pink Floyd \u2013 The Wall\" (1982), \"Superman III\" (1983), \"Krull\" (1983), \"Legend\" (1985), \"Aliens\" (1986), Stanley Kubrick's \"Full Metal Jacket\" (1987), \"\" (1985) and Tim Burton's \"Batman\" (1989), were all produced at Pinewood.\n1990s.\nThe 1990s saw large-scale productions, such as \"Alien 3\" (1992), \"Tomorrow Never Dies\" (1997), and \"The World Is Not Enough\" (1999) produced at the studios which kept Pinewood operating.\n2000s.\nThe Rank Group owned the studio until 2001, when it sold Pinewood for \u00a362 million to a group led by Michael Grade and Ivan Dunleavy and financed by private equity group 3i, who held an 80% stake. The purchase of Shepperton Studios from a consortium headed by Ridley and Tony Scott, gave rise to the Pinewood Group, eventually comprising Pinewood Studios, Shepperton Studios, Teddington Studios, Pinewood Toronto Studios, Pinewood Indomina Studios, Pinewood Studio Berlin, Pinewood Iskandar Malaysia Studios, and a joint venture in the US with Pinewood Atlanta Studios.\nIn 2009, Pinewood and Shepperton received a BAFTA Award for their Outstanding British Contribution to Cinema.\n2010s.\nThe Pinewood Studios Group was subject to a hostile takeover approach in 2011. Manchester-based The Peel Group acquired a 73% stake, but Warren James Jewellers retained a 27% stake, so preventing a full takeover. In 2012 Financial Services Authority considered cancelling the stock market listing because nearly all the shares are held by two groups. In June 2016, five new stages and 10 new workshops were opened at Pinewood.\nIn 2019, the Walt Disney Studios announced a 10-year lease of most of the Pinewood Studios in September 2019, to start in 2020.\n2020s.\nIn 2025, Marvel Studios moved their main production servers and offices to Pinewood Studios, starting predominantly with the productions of films ', ', co-produced with Sony, and ' and ', as well as the show \"VisionQuest\".\nStages, studios and locations.\nThe 007 Stage was originally built for the Bond film \"The Spy Who Loved Me\" (1977); it had one of the largest water tanks in Europe. The stage was destroyed by fire in 1984; it was rebuilt four months later and renamed Albert R. Broccoli's 007 Stage in time to film \"A View to a Kill\". Another fire on 30 July 2006 seriously damaged the stage, causing the roof to partly collapse. Construction of a new stage began on 18 September and was completed in under six months. Since then, the stage has accommodated large productions including \"\" (2010), \"Quantum of Solace\" (2008). The whole fishing village from \"Mamma Mia!\" (2008) was built on the stage.\nAs well as the 007 Stage, which is the largest stage at any of the studios under The Pinewood Studios Group at , the studio has fifteen other stages ranging from just , to cater for productions of all sizes. One of those studios, the T Stage, is a specialist stage for both television and film productions and the Studios second largest stage at .\nPinewood Studios paid tribute to Richard Attenborough's body of work by naming a purpose-built film and television stage after him. The Richard Attenborough Stage has an area of . In his absence because of illness, Lord Puttnam and Pinewood chairman Lord Grade officially unveiled the stage on 23 April 2012. Opposite it is a post-production block named in honour of Stanley Kubrick.\nThe studio also has two specialist TV studios, TV One and TV Two, complete with galleries, TV studio floors, TV lighting grids and SD or HD facilities. Both studios stand at just under .\nPinewood sits on the old estate of Heatherden Hall. The mansion, its gardens, and other parts of the studios have been used in various productions over the years. \"Peeping Tom\" (1960) shows people driving out through the main gate and has various shots in the studios (showing things behind the camera), offices and corridors. \"Return to the Edge of the World\" (1978) includes shots of director Michael Powell driving into the studio. The main gate (no longer used due to the construction of a purpose-built security entrance further along the road) also features in \"My Week with Marilyn\" (2011) when Eddie Redmayne greets Judi Dench. This film also contains many shots of the dressing-room corridors in the main make-up block. Heatherden Hall (converted to production offices) has appeared in several films: it was made to look fire-damaged and derelict for the children's film \"The Amazing Mr Blunden\" (1972) and also appeared as the Indian residence of Governor Sir Sidney Ruff-Diamond in \"Carry On Up the Khyber\" (1969).\nThe studios have acres of backlots where large sets have been built, from castles to whole villages including the Baker Street set built for Billy Wilder's \"The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes\" and Godric's Hollow from the \"Harry Potter\" film series.\nBurnham Beeches and Black Park.\nThe proximity of the ancient woodland Burnham Beeches and Black Park to Pinewood (as well as to Shepperton and Bray studios) made Burnham Beeches a desirable filming location for productions being filmed at Pinewood. Burnham Beeches was used for \"Robin Hood Prince of Thieves\", \"First Knight\", \"Goldfinger\", \"The Princess Bride\" and \"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, Fahrenheit 451\" at Black Park.\nFormer.\nPinewood Atlanta Studios.\nThe studios announced in April 2013 that its first film production facility in the United States would be located south of Atlanta at a complex consisting of in Fayette County, Georgia. Pinewood Atlanta is a joint venture between Pinewood and River's Rock LLC, an independently managed trust of the Cathy family, founders of the Chick-fil-A fast-food chain.\nIn August 2019, Pinewood sold their shares in the Atlanta location. The studio officially ended its relationship with the location in October 2020 with the renaming of the studio to Trilith.\nPinewood Iskandar Malaysia Studios.\nPinewood Iskandar Malaysia Studios is a studio complex located at a site in Iskandar Puteri, Johor, managed by The Pinewood Studios Group. It targets the Asia-Pacific region. Pinewood Shepperton plc entered into a strategic agreement with Khazanah Nasional Berhad, the investment holding arm of the Government of Malaysia in connection with the development of a new film and television studio facility in Iskandar Malaysia.\nConstruction began towards the end of 2010, with completion expected by the end of 2012. The facilities being built as part of the studio complex include of film stages, ranging from to . The first two at while the other two at . The biggest stage at will have a water tank for productions that require work on or under water. There are 2 TV studios, each at .\nIn July 2019, Pinewood Iskandar Malaysia Studios was rebranded to Iskandar Malaysia Studios and the affiliation with Pinewood Shepperton plc ended.\nWater filming.\nPinewood's water filming facilities include the Underwater Stage, and an Exterior Tank backed with a green screen measuring .\nProject Pinewood.\nIn November 2007, Pinewood announced a \u00a3200m expansion plan, known as Project Pinewood. If would have included replicas of streetscapes and zones replicating locations from the UK, Europe and the United States. Planned zones include a college campus, Amsterdam, modern European housing, Venice, Lake Como, Paris, an amphitheatre, Prague, west coast American housing, warehousing and downtown New York sets, Chicago, Vienna, a castle, a UK canal, Chinatown and a London street market built. In addition it will also be used as residential housing, with the proposed creative community, expected to be in the region of 2000 and 2250, being integrated with the film locations. Following consultations with the local community the plans changed to reflect the community's opinions and suggestions. However, the planning application was rejected by South Bucks District Council in October 2009, following a opposition campaign by local residents, who formed a \"Stop Project Pinewood\" group.\nPinewood appealed against the decision and a public inquiry commenced on 5 April 2011 and on 20 January 2012, it was announced that the appeal had been turned down. On 15 May 2013, local councillors in South Buckinghamshire rejected a pared down version of the expansion plans. The chief executive of the studios, Ivan Dunleavy, said he expected to appeal against the latest decision to the Secretary of State, Eric Pickles, who rejected the previous application, a year earlier. On 19 June 2014 it was reported that Pinewood Studios had received approval to go ahead with the multimillion-pound expansion plans which would see it rival Hollywood film sets.\nEnter the Pitch.\nPinewood Studios is one of the sponsors for the short film competition \"Enter the Pitch,\" also known as the Pitch, which launched in 2009. The Pitch is an online short film pitching competition that invites film makers to submit a project that takes inspiration from any story, character, or theme in the Bible. The top ten finalists are invited to Pinewood Studios, where they pitch their film to a panel of industry professionals. The person giving the best pitch wins an apprenticeship with industry professionals and is mentored on how to turn their pitch into a short film.\nThe inaugural Pitch winner was Simeon Lumgair's \"Derelict\" (2009); the most recent as of 2020[ [update]] was Oneikeh Campbell's \"Five Thousand Stars\" (2020).\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Its methods and conclusions are not supported by scientific evidence, and as such it is considered to be a pseudoscience.\nGraphology has been controversial for more than a century. Although proponents point to positive testimonials as anecdotal evidence of its utility for personality evaluation, these claims have not been supported by scientific studies. It has been rated as among the most discredited methods of psychological analysis by a survey of mental health professionals.\nEtymology.\nThe word \"graphology\" derives from the Greek (; 'writing'), and (; 'theory').\nHistory.\nIn 1991, Jean-Charles Gille-Maisani stated that Juan Huarte de San Juan's 1575 was the first book on handwriting analysis. In American graphology, Camillo Baldi's from 1622 is considered to be the first book.\nAround 1830, Jean-Hippolyte Michon became interested in handwriting analysis. He published his findings shortly after founding \"Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Graphologique\" in 1871. The most prominent of his disciples was Jules Cr\u00e9pieux-Jamin, who rapidly published a series of books that were soon published in other languages. Starting from Michon's integrative approach, Cr\u00e9pieux-Jamin founded a holistic approach to graphology.\nAlfred Binet was convinced to conduct research into graphology from 1893 to 1907. He called it \"the science of the future\" despite rejection of his results by graphologists.\nFrench psychiatrist Joseph Rogues De Fursac combined graphology and psychiatry in the 1905 book .\nAfter World War\u00a0I, interest in graphology continued to spread in Europe and the United States. In Germany during the 1920s, Ludwig Klages founded and published his findings in (\"Journal for the Study of Mankind\"). His major contribution to the field can be found in .\nThea Stein Lewinson and J. Zubin modified Klage's ideas, based upon their experience working for the U.S. government, publishing their method in 1942.\nIn 1929, Milton Bunker founded The American Grapho Analysis Society teaching graphoanalysis. This organization and its system split the American graphology world in two. Students had to choose between graphoanalysis or holistic graphology. While hard data is lacking, anecdotal accounts indicate that 10% of the members of International Graphoanalysis Society (IGAS) were expelled between 1970 and 1980.\nRegarding a proposed correlation between biological sex and handwriting style, a paper published by James Hartley in 1989 concluded that there was some evidence in support of this hypothesis.\nRowan Bayne, a British psychologist who has written several studies on graphology, summarized his view of the appeal of graphology: \"[I]t's very seductive because at a very crude level someone who is neat and well behaved tends to have neat handwriting\", adding that the practice is \"useless... absolutely hopeless\". The British Psychological Society ranks graphology alongside astrology, giving them both \"zero validity\".\nGraphology was also dismissed as a pseudoscience by the skeptic James Randi in 1991.\nIn his May 21, 2013 Skeptoid podcast episode titled \"All About Graphology\", scientific skeptic author Brian Dunning reports:In his book \"The Write Stuff\", Barry Beyerstein summarized the work of Geoffrey Dean, who performed probably the most extensive literature survey of graphology ever done. Dean did a meta-analysis on some 200 studies:\nDean showed that graphologists have unequivocally failed to demonstrate any validity or reliability of their art for predicting work performance, aptitudes, or personality. Graphology thus fails according to the standards which a genuine psychological test must pass before it can ethically be released for use on the public.\nDean found that no particular school of graphology fared better than any other. In fact, no graphologist of any kind was able to show reliably better performance than untrained amateurs making guesses from the same materials. In the vast majority of studies, neither group exceeded chance expectancy.\nDunning concludes:Other non-scientific techniques like iridology, phrenology, palmistry, and astrology also have differing schools of thought, require years of training, offer expensive certifications, and fail just as soundly when put to a scientific controlled test. Handwriting analysis does have its plausible-sounding separation from those other techniques though, and that's the whole \"handwriting is brainwriting\" idea \u2014 traits from the brain will be manifested in the way that it controls the muscles of the hand. Unfortunately, this is just as unscientific as the others. No amount of sciencey sounding language can make up for a technique failing when put to a scientifically controlled test.\nUse by employers.\nAlthough graphology had some support in the scientific community before the mid-twentieth century, more recent research rejects the validity of graphology as a tool to assess personality and job performance. Today it is considered a pseudoscience. Many studies have been conducted to assess its effectiveness to predict personality and job performance. Recent studies testing the validity of using handwriting for predicting personality traits and job performance have been consistently negative.\nMeasures of job performance appear similarly unrelated to the handwriting metrics of graphologists. Professional graphologists using handwriting analysis were just as ineffective as lay people at predicting performance in a 1989 study. A broad literature screen by King and Koehler confirmed that dozens of studies showing the geometric aspects of graphology (slant, slope, etc.) are essentially worthless as predictors of job performance.\nSystems.\nIntegrative graphology focuses on the strokes and their purported relation to personality. Graphoanalysis was the most influential system in the United States between 1929 and 2000.\nHolistic graphology is based on form, movement, and use of space. It uses psychograms to analyze handwriting.\nFour academic institutions offer an accredited degree in handwriting analysis:\nVocabulary.\nEvery system of handwriting analysis has its own vocabulary. Even though two or more systems may share the same words, the meanings of those words may be different. The technical meaning of a word used by a handwriting analyst, and the common meaning is not congruent. Resentment, for example, in common usage, means annoyance. In graphoanalysis, the term indicates a fear of imposition.\nLegal considerations.\nHungary.\nA report by the Hungarian Parliamentary Commissioner for Data Protection and Freedom of Information says that handwriting analysis without informed consent is a privacy violation.\nUnited States.\nEmployment law.\nA 2001 advisory opinion letter from the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission responded to a question regarding \"whether it is legal to use an analysis of an applicant's handwriting as an employment screening tool. You also ask whether it is legal to ask the applicant's age and use of medications to allow for variants in his/her handwriting.\" The letter advised that in this circumstance, it was illegal under the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA) to ask a job applicant whether he or she is taking any medications, and also advised that asking an applicant for his or her age \"allegedly to allow for variants in analyzing his/her handwriting\" was not a \"per se\" violation of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (ADEA), but could be significant evidence of age discrimination. The letter also said that there was no judicial guidance on \"whether a policy of excluding applicants based upon their handwriting has an adverse impact on a protected group\" under the ADA, ADEA, or Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.\nApplications.\nGender and handwriting.\nA 1991 review of the then-current literature concluded that respondents were able to predict the gender of handwriting between 57 and 78% of the time. However, most of these samples, as well as subsequent studies, are based on small sample sizes that are collected non-randomly. A much larger and more recent survey of over 3,000 participants only found a classification accuracy of 54%. As statistical discrimination below 0.7 is generally considered unacceptable, this indicates that most results are rather inaccurate, and that variation in results observed is likely due to sampling technique and bias.\nThe reason for this bias varies; hypotheses are that biology contributes due to average differences in fine motor skills among males and females, and that differences arise from culture and gender bias.\nEmployment profiling.\nA company takes a writing sample provided by an applicant, and does a personality profile, supposedly matching the congruence of the applicant with the ideal psychological profile of employees in the position. The applicant can also malpractice in this system; they may ask someone to write on their behalf.\nA graphological report is meant to be used in conjunction with other tools, such as comprehensive background checks, practical demonstration or record of work skills. Graphology supporters state that it can complement but not replace traditional hiring tools.\nResearch in employment suitability has ranged from complete failure to guarded\nsuccess. The most substantial reason for not using handwriting analysis in the employment process is the absence of evidence of a direct link between handwriting analysis and various measures of job performance.\nThe use of graphology in the hiring process has been criticized on ethical and legal grounds in the United States.\nPsychological analysis.\nGraphology has been used clinically by counselors and psychotherapists. When it is used, it is generally used alongside other projective personality assessment tools, and not in isolation. It is often used within individual psychotherapy, marital counseling, or vocational counseling.\nMarital compatibility.\nIn its simplest form only sexual expression and sexual response are examined. At its most complex, every aspect of an individual is examined for how it affects the other individual(s) within the relationship. The theory is that after knowing and understanding how each individual in the relationship differs from every other individual in the relationship, the resulting marriage will be more enduring. With a comparative analysis receiving and non-receiving parts responses are measured.\nMedical diagnosis.\nMedical graphology is probably the most controversial branch of handwriting analysis. Strictly speaking, such research is not graphology as described throughout this article but an examination of factors pertaining to motor control. Research studies have been conducted in which a detailed examination of handwriting factors, particularly timing, fluidity, and consistency of size, form, speed, and pressure are considered in the process of evaluating patients and their response to pharmacological therapeutic agents. The study of these phenomena is a by-product of researchers investigating motor control processes and the interaction of nervous, anatomical, and biomechanical systems of the body.\n\"The Vanguard Code of Ethical Practice\", amongst others, prohibits medical diagnosis by those not licensed to do diagnosis in the state in which they practice.\nGraphotherapy.\n\"Graphotherapy\" is the pseudoscience of changing a person's handwriting with the goal of changing features of his or her personality, or \"handwriting analysis in reverse.\" It originated in France during the 1930s, spreading to the United States in the late 1950s. The purported therapy consists of a series of exercises similar to those taught in basic calligraphy courses, sometimes in conjunction with music or positive self-talk.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

She was murdered with her family by a group of Bolsheviks in Yekaterinburg on 17 July 1918.\nPersistent rumors of her possible escape circulated after her death, fueled by the fact that the location of her burial was unknown during the decades of communist rule. The abandoned mine serving as a mass grave near Yekaterinburg which held the acidified remains of the Tsar, his wife, and three of their daughters was revealed in 1991. These remains were put to rest at Peter and Paul Fortress in 1998. The bodies of Alexei and the remaining daughter\u2014either Anastasia or her older sister Maria\u2014were discovered in 2007. Her purported survival has been conclusively disproven. Scientific analysis including DNA testing confirmed that the remains are those of the imperial family, showing that Anastasia was killed alongside her family.\nSeveral women falsely claimed to have been Anastasia; the best known impostor was Anna Anderson. Anderson's body was cremated upon her death in 1984; DNA testing in 1994 on pieces of Anderson's tissue and hair showed no relation to the Romanov family.\nBiography.\nEarly years.\nAnastasia was born on 18 June 1901. She was the fourth daughter of Tsar Nicholas II and Tsarina Alexandra. When she was born, her parents and extended family were disappointed that she was a girl. They had hoped for a son who would have become heir apparent to the throne. Her father went for a long walk to compose himself before going to visit his wife and their newborn child for the first time. Her paternal aunt Grand Duchess Xenia Alexandrovna of Russia said, \"My God! What a disappointment!... a fourth girl!\" Her first cousin twice removed Grand Duke Konstantin Konstantinovich wrote, \"Forgive us, Lord, if we all felt disappointment instead of joy. We were so hoping for a boy, and it's a daughter.\" The travel writer Burton Holmes wrote, \"Nicholas would part with half his Empire in exchange for one Imperial boy.\"\nAnastasia was named for the fourth-century martyr St. Anastasia. \"Anastasia\" is a Greek name (\u0391\u03bd\u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03b1\u03c3\u03af\u03b1), meaning \"of the resurrection\", a fact often alluded to later in stories about her rumored survival. Anastasia's title is most precisely translated as \"Grand Princess\". \"Grand Duchess\" became the most widely used translation of the title into English from Russian.\nThe Tsar's children were raised as simply as possible. They slept on hard camp cots without pillows, except when they were ill, took cold baths in the morning, and were expected to tidy their rooms and do needlework to be sold at various charity events when they were not otherwise occupied. Most in the household, including the servants, generally called the Grand Duchess by her first name and patronym, \"Anastasia Nikolaevna\", and did not use her title or style. She was occasionally called by the French version of her name, \"Anastasie\", or by the Russian nicknames \"Nastasya\", \"Nastya\", \"Nastas\", or \"Nastenka\". Other family nicknames for Anastasia were \"Malenkaya\", meaning \"little (one)\" in Russian, or \"Shvybzik\", meaning \"merry little one\" or \"little mischief\" in German.\nAnastasia and her older sister Maria were known within the family as \"The Little Pair\". The two girls shared a room, often wore variations of the same dress, and spent much of their time together. Their older sisters Olga and Tatiana also shared a room and were known as \"The Big Pair\". The four girls sometimes signed letters using the nickname OTMA, which derived from the first letters of their first names.\nDNA testing on the remains of the imperial family proved conclusively in 2009 that Anastasia's younger brother, Alexei, suffered from Hemophilia B, a rare form of the disease. His mother and one sister, identified alternatively as Maria or Anastasia, were carriers. Symptomatic carriers of the gene, while not hemophiliacs themselves, can have symptoms of hemophilia including a lower than normal blood-clotting factor that can lead to heavy bleeding. If Anastasia lived to have children of her own, it is genetically probable that they would have been afflicted by the disease.\nAppearance and personality.\nAnastasia was short and inclined to be chubby, and she had blue eyes and blonde hair. Baroness Sophie Buxhoeveden, her mother's lady-in-waiting, reflected that \"her features were regular and finely cut. She had fair hair, fine eyes, with impish laughter in their depths, and dark eyebrows that nearly met.\" Buxhoeveden believed that Anastasia resembled her mother, saying that she \"was more like her mother's than her father's family. She was rather short even at seventeen, and was, then decidedly fat, but it was the fatness of youth. She would have outgrown it, as had her sister Marie.\"\nAnastasia was a vivacious and energetic child. Margaretta Eagar, a governess to the four grand duchesses, said one person commented that the toddler Anastasia had the greatest personal charm of any child she had ever seen.\nWhile often described as gifted and bright, she was never interested in the restrictions of the school room, according to her tutors Pierre Gilliard and Sydney Gibbes. Gibbes, Gilliard, and ladies-in-waiting Lili Dehn and Anna Vyrubova described Anastasia as lively, mischievous, and a gifted actress. Her sharp, witty remarks sometimes hit sensitive spots. However, she was also very amusing: \"Even as a baby she had entertained grave old men, who were her neighbors at table, with her astonishing remarks.\"\nAnastasia's daring occasionally exceeded the limits of acceptable behavior. \"She undoubtedly held the record for punishable deeds in her family, for in naughtiness she was a true genius\", said Gleb Botkin, son of the court physician Yevgeny Botkin, who later died with the family at Yekaterinburg. Anastasia sometimes tripped the servants and played pranks on her tutors. As a child, she would climb trees and refuse to come down. Once, during a snowball fight at the family's Polish estate, Anastasia rolled a rock into a snowball and threw it at her older sister Tatiana, knocking her to the ground. A distant cousin, Princess Nina Georgievna, recalled that \"Anastasia was nasty to the point of being evil\", and would cheat, kick and scratch her playmates during games; she was affronted because the younger Nina was taller than she was. She was less concerned about her appearance than her sisters. Hallie Erminie Rives, a best-selling American author and wife of an American diplomat, described how 10-year-old Anastasia ate chocolates without bothering to remove her long, white opera gloves at the St. Petersburg opera house.\nDespite her energy, Anastasia's physical health was sometimes poor. The Grand Duchess suffered from painful bunions, which affected both of her big toes. Anastasia had a weak muscle in her back and was prescribed a massage twice per week. She hid under the bed or in a cupboard to put off receiving the massage. Anastasia's older sister, Maria, reportedly hemorrhaged in December 1914 during an operation to remove her tonsils, according to her paternal aunt Grand Duchess Olga Alexandrovna of Russia, who was interviewed later in her life. The doctor performing the operation was so unnerved that he had to be ordered to continue by Maria's mother. Olga Alexandrovna said she believed all four of her nieces bled more than was normal and believed they were carriers of the hemophilia gene, like their mother.\nAssociation with Grigori Rasputin.\nHer mother relied on the counsel of Grigori Rasputin, a Russian peasant and wandering \"starets\" or \"holy man,\" and credited his prayers with saving the ailing Tsarevich on numerous occasions. Anastasia and her siblings were taught to view Rasputin as \"Our Friend\" and to share confidences with him. In the autumn of 1907, Anastasia's aunt Grand Duchess Olga Alexandrovna of Russia was escorted to the nursery by the Tsar to meet Rasputin. Anastasia, her sisters and brother Alexei were all wearing their long white nightgowns. \"All the children seemed to like him,\" Olga Alexandrovna recalled. \"They were completely at ease with him.\" Rasputin's friendship with the imperial children was evident in some of the messages he sent to them. In February 1909, Rasputin sent the imperial children a telegram, advising them to \"Love the whole of God's nature, the whole of His creation in particular this earth. The Mother of God was always occupied with flowers and needlework.\"\nHowever, one of the girls' governesses, Sofia Ivanovna Tyutcheva, was horrified in 1910 that Rasputin was permitted access to the nursery when the four girls were in their nightgowns and wanted him barred. Nicholas asked Rasputin to avoid going to the nurseries in the future. The children were aware of the tension and feared that their mother would be angered by Tyutcheva's actions. \"I am so afr(aid) that S.I. (governess Sofia Ivanovna Tyutcheva) can speak\u00a0... about our friend something bad,\" Anastasia's twelve-year-old sister Tatiana wrote to their mother on 8 March 1910. \"I hope our nurse will be nice to our friend now.\" \nTyutcheva was eventually fired. She took her story to other members of the family. While Rasputin's visits to the children were, by all accounts, completely innocent in nature, the family was scandalized. Tyutcheva told Nicholas's sister, Grand Duchess Xenia Alexandrovna of Russia, that Rasputin visited the girls, talked with them while they were getting ready for bed, and hugged and patted them. Tyutcheva said the children had been taught not to discuss Rasputin with her and were careful to hide his visits from the nursery staff. Xenia wrote on 15 March 1910, that she could not understand \"...the attitude of Alix and the children to that sinister Grigory (whom they consider to be almost a saint, when in fact he's only a \"khlyst\"!)\"\nIn the spring of 1910, Maria Ivanovna Vishnyakova, a royal governess, claimed that Rasputin had raped her. Vishnyakova said the empress refused to believe her account of the assault, and insisted that \"everything Rasputin does is holy.\" Grand Duchess Olga Alexandrovna was told that Vishnyakova's claim had been immediately investigated, but instead \"they caught the young woman in bed with a Cossack of the Imperial Guard.\" Vishnyakova was kept from seeing Rasputin after she made her accusation and was eventually dismissed from her post in 1913.\nHowever, rumors persisted and it was later whispered in society that Rasputin had seduced not only the Tsarina but also the four grand duchesses. This was followed by circulation of pornographic cartoons, which depicted Rasputin having relations with the Empress, her four daughters and Anna Vyrubova. After the scandal, Nicholas ordered Rasputin to leave St. Petersburg for a time, much to Alexandra's displeasure, and Rasputin went on a pilgrimage to Palestine. Despite the rumors, the imperial family's association with Rasputin continued until his murder on 17 December 1916. \"Our Friend is so contented with our girlies, says they have gone through heavy 'courses' for their age and their souls have much developed\", Alexandra wrote to Nicholas on 6 December 1916.\nIn his memoirs, A. A. Mordvinov reported that the four grand duchesses appeared \"cold and visibly terribly upset\" by Rasputin's death, and sat \"huddled up closely together\" on a sofa in one of their bedrooms on the night they received the news. Mordvinov recalled that the young women were in a gloomy mood and seemed to sense the political upheaval that was about to be unleashed. Rasputin was buried with an icon signed on its reverse by Anastasia, her mother and her sisters. She attended his funeral on 21 December 1916, and her family planned to build a church over the site of Rasputin's grave. After they were killed by the Bolsheviks, it was discovered Anastasia and her sisters were all wearing amulets bearing Rasputin's picture and a prayer.\nCaptivity during World War I and Russian Revolution.\nDuring World War I, Anastasia, along with her sister Maria, visited wounded soldiers at a private hospital in the grounds at Tsarskoye Selo. The two teenagers, too young to become Red Cross nurses like their mother and elder sisters, played games of checkers and billiards with the soldiers and tried to lift their spirits. Felix Dassel, who was treated at the hospital and knew Anastasia, recalled that the grand duchess had a \"laugh like a squirrel\", and walked rapidly \"as though she \"tripped\" along.\"\nIn February 1917, Anastasia and her family were placed under house arrest at the Alexander Palace in Tsarskoye Selo during the Russian Revolution. Nicholas II abdicated on 15 March\u00a0[O.S. 2 March]\u00a01917. As the Bolsheviks approached, Alexander Kerensky of the Provisional Government had them moved to Tobolsk, Siberia, where they were housed in the Governor's Mansion. After the Bolsheviks seized majority control of Russia, Anastasia and her family were moved to the Ipatiev House, or House of Special Purpose, at Yekaterinburg.\nThe stress and uncertainty of captivity took their toll on Anastasia as well as her family. \"Goodby [\"sic\"]\", she wrote to a friend in the winter of 1917. \"Don't forget us.\" At Tobolsk, she wrote a melancholy theme for her English tutor, filled with spelling mistakes, about \"Evelyn Hope\", a poem by Robert Browning about a girl: \"When she died she was only sixteen years old ... Ther(e) was a man who loved her without having seen her but (k)new her very well. And she he(a)rd of him also. He never could tell her that he loved her, and now she was dead. But still he thought that when he and she will live [their] next life whenever it will be that\u00a0...\", she wrote.\nUpon arriving in Yekaterinburg, Pierre Gilliard recalled his last sight of the children:\n\"The sailor Nagorny, who attended to Alexei Nikolaevitch, passed my window carrying the sick boy in his arms, behind him came the Grand Duchesses loaded with valises and small personal belongings. I tried to get out, but was roughly pushed back into the carriage by the sentry. I came back to the window. Tatiana Nikolayevna came last carrying her little dog and struggling to drag a heavy brown valise. It was raining and I saw her feet sink into the mud at every step. Nagorny tried to come to her assistance; he was roughly pushed back by one of the commisars\u00a0...\"\nBaroness Sophie Buxhoeveden told of her sad last glimpse of Anastasia: \"Once, standing on some steps at the door of a house close by, I saw a hand and a pink-sleeved arm opening the topmost pane. According to the blouse the hand must have belonged either to the Grand Duchess Marie or Anastasia. They could not see me through their windows, and this was to be the last glimpse that I was to have of any of them!\"\nHowever, even in the last months of her life, she found ways to enjoy herself. She and other members of the household performed plays for the enjoyment of their parents and others in the spring of 1918. Anastasia's performance made everyone howl with laughter, according to her tutor Sydney Gibbes.\nOn 7 May 1918, in a letter from Tobolsk to her sister Maria in Yekaterinburg, Anastasia described a moment of joy despite her sadness and loneliness and worry for the sick Alexei: \"We played on the swing, that was when I roared with laughter, the fall was so wonderful! Indeed! I told the sisters about it so many times yesterday that they got quite fed up, but I could go on telling it masses of times\u00a0... What weather we've had! One could simply shout with joy.\" In his memoirs, one of the guards at the Ipatiev House, Alexander Strekotin, remembered Anastasia as \"very friendly and full of fun\", while another guard said Anastasia was \"a very charming devil! She was mischievous and, I think, rarely tired. She was lively, and was fond of performing comic mimes with the dogs, as though they were performing in a circus.\" Yet another of the guards, however, called the youngest grand duchess \"offensive and a terrorist\" and complained that her occasionally provocative comments sometimes caused tension in the ranks. Anastasia and her sisters helped their maid darn stockings and assisted the cook in making bread and other kitchen chores while they were in captivity at the Ipatiev House.\nIn the summer, the privations of the captivity, including their closer confinement at the Ipatiev House negatively affected the family. On 14 July 1918, local priests at Yekaterinburg conducted a private church service for the family. They reported that Anastasia and her family, contrary to custom, fell on their knees during the prayer for the dead, and that the girls had become despondent and hopeless, and no longer sang the replies in the service. Noticing this dramatic change in their demeanor since his last visit, one priest told the other, \"Something has happened to them in there.\" But the next day, on 15 July 1918, Anastasia and her sisters appeared in good spirits as they joked and helped move the beds in their shared bedroom so that cleaning women could clean the floors. They helped the women scrub the floors and whispered to them when the guards were not watching. Anastasia stuck her tongue out at Yakov Yurovsky, the head of the detachment, when he momentarily turned his back and left the room.\nDeath.\nAfter the Bolshevik revolution in October 1917, Russia quickly disintegrated into civil war. Negotiations for the release of the Romanovs between their Bolshevik (commonly referred to as 'Reds') captors and their extended family, many of whom were prominent members of the royal houses of Europe, stalled. As the Whites (anti-Bolshevik forces, although not necessarily supportive of the Tsar) advanced toward Yekaterinburg, the Reds were in a precarious situation. The Reds knew Yekaterinburg would fall to the better manned and equipped White Army. When the Whites reached Yekaterinburg, the imperial family had simply disappeared. The most widely accepted account was that the family had been murdered. This was due to an investigation by White Army investigator Nicholas Sokolov, who came to the conclusion based on items that had belonged to the family being found thrown down a mine shaft at Ganina Yama.\nThe \"Yurovsky Note\", an account of the event filed by Yurovsky to his Bolshevik superiors following the killings, was found in 1989 and detailed in Edvard Radzinsky's 1992 book, \"The Last Tsar\". According to the note, on the night of the deaths, the family was awakened and told to dress. They were told they were being moved to a new location to ensure their safety in anticipation of the violence that might ensue when the White Army reached Yekaterinburg. Once dressed, the family and the small circle of servants who had remained with them were herded into a small room in the house's sub-basement and told to wait. Alexandra and Alexei sat in chairs provided by guards at the Empress's request.\nAfter several minutes, the guards entered the room, led by Yurovsky, who quickly informed the Tsar and his family that they were to be executed. The Tsar had time to say only \"What?\" and turn to his family before he was killed by several bullets to the chest (not, as is commonly stated, to the head; his skull, recovered in 1991, bears no bullet wounds). The Tsarina and her daughter Olga tried to make the sign of the cross but were killed in the initial volley of bullets fired by the executioners. The rest of the Imperial retinue were shot in short order, with the exception of Anna Demidova, Alexandra's maid. Demidova survived the initial onslaught but was quickly stabbed to death against the back wall of the basement while trying to defend herself with a small pillow she had carried into the sub-basement that was filled with precious gems and jewels.\nThe \"Yurovsky Note\" further reported that once the thick smoke that had filled the room from so many weapons being fired in such close proximity cleared, it was discovered that the executioners' bullets had ricocheted off the corsets of two or three of the Grand Duchesses. The executioners later came to find out that this was because the family's crown jewels and diamonds had been sewn inside the linings of the corsets to hide them from their captors. The corsets thus served as a form of \"armor\" against the bullets. Anastasia and Maria were said to have crouched up against a wall, covering their heads in terror, until they were shot down by bullets, recalled Yurovsky. However, another guard, Peter Ermakov, told his wife that Anastasia had been finished off with bayonets. As the bodies were carried out, one or more of the girls cried out, and were clubbed on the back of the head, wrote Yurovsky.\nFalse reports of survival.\nAnastasia's supposed escape and possible survival was one of the most popular historical mysteries of the 20th century, provoking many books and films. At least ten women claimed to be her, offering varying stories as to how she had survived. Anna Anderson, the best known Anastasia impostor, first surfaced publicly between 1920 and 1922. She contended that she had feigned death among the bodies of her family and servants, and was able to make her escape with the help of a compassionate guard who noticed she was still breathing and took pity upon her. Her legal battle for recognition from 1938 to 1970 continued a lifelong controversy and was the longest running case ever heard by the German courts, where it was officially filed. The final decision of the court was that Anderson had not provided sufficient proof to claim the identity of the grand duchess.\nAnderson died in 1984 and her body was cremated. DNA tests were conducted in 1994 on a tissue sample from Anderson located in a hospital and the blood of Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, a great-nephew of Empress Alexandra. According to Dr Gill who conducted the tests, \"If you accept that these samples came from Anna Anderson, then Anna Anderson could not be related to Tsar Nicholas or Tsarina Alexandra.\" Anderson's mitochondrial DNA was a match with a great-nephew of Franziska Schanzkowska, a missing Polish factory worker. Some supporters of Anderson's claim acknowledged that the DNA tests proving she could not have been the Grand Duchess had \"won the day\".\nOther lesser known claimants were Nadezhda Ivanovna Vasilyeva and Eugenia Smith. Two young women claiming to be Anastasia and her sister Maria were taken in by a priest in the Ural Mountains in 1919 where they lived as nuns until their deaths in 1964. They were buried under the names Anastasia and Maria Nikolaevna.\nRumors of Anastasia's survival were embellished with various contemporary reports of trains and houses being searched for \"Anastasia Romanov\" by Bolshevik soldiers and secret police. When she was briefly imprisoned at Perm in 1918, Princess Helena Petrovna, the wife of Anastasia's distant cousin, Prince John Constantinovich of Russia, reported that a guard brought a girl who called herself Anastasia Romanova to her cell and asked if the girl was the daughter of the Tsar. Helena Petrovna said she did not recognize the girl and the guard took her away. Although other witnesses in Perm later reported that they saw Anastasia, her mother and sisters in Perm after the murders, this story is now widely discredited. Rumors that they were alive were fueled by deliberate misinformation designed to hide the fact that the family was dead. A few days after they had been murdered, the German government sent several telegrams to Russia demanding \"the safety of the princesses of German blood\". Russia had recently signed a peace treaty with the Germans, and did not want to upset them by letting them know the women were dead, so they told them they had been moved to a safer location.\nIn another incident, eight witnesses reported the recapture of a young woman after an apparent escape attempt in September 1918 at a railway station at Siding 37, northwest of Perm. These witnesses were Maxim Grigoyev, Tatiana Sitnikova (and her son Fyodor Sitnikov), Ivan Kuklin and Matrina Kuklina, Vassily Ryabov, Ustinya Varankina, and Dr Pavel Utkin, a physician who treated the girl after the incident. Some of the witnesses identified the girl as Anastasia when they were shown photographs of the grand duchess by White Russian Army investigators. Utkin also told the White Russian Army investigators that the injured girl, whom he treated at Cheka headquarters in Perm, told him, \"I am the daughter of the ruler, Anastasia.\" Utkin obtained a prescription from a pharmacy for a patient named \"N\" at the orders of the secret police. White Army investigators later independently located records for the prescription. During the same time period in mid-1918, there were several reports of young people in Russia passing themselves off as Romanov escapees. Boris Soloviev, the husband of Rasputin's daughter Maria, defrauded prominent Russian families by asking for money for a Romanov impostor to escape to China. Soloviev also found young women willing to masquerade as one of the grand duchesses to assist in deceiving the families he had defrauded.\nSome biographers' accounts speculated that the opportunity for one or more of the guards to rescue a survivor existed. Yakov Yurovsky demanded that the guards come to his office and turn over items they had stolen following the murder. There was reportedly a span of time when the bodies of the victims were left largely unattended in the truck, in the basement and in the corridor of the house. Some guards who had not participated in the murders and had been sympathetic to the grand duchesses were reportedly left in the basement with the bodies.\nRomanov graves and DNA proof.\nIn 1991, the presumed burial site of the imperial family and their servants was excavated in the woods outside Yekaterinburg. The grave had been found nearly a decade earlier, but was kept hidden by its discoverers from the Communists who were still ruling Russia at the time. The grave only held nine of the expected eleven sets of remains. DNA and skeletal analysis matched these remains to Tsar Nicholas II, Tsarina Alexandra, and three of the four grand duchesses (Olga, Tatiana and presumably Maria). The other remains, with unrelated DNA, correspond to the family's doctor (Yevgeny Botkin), their valet (Alexei Trupp), their cook (Ivan Kharitonov), and Alexandra's maid (Anna Demidova). Forensic expert William R. Maples found that the Tsarevitch Alexei and Anastasia's bodies were missing from the family's grave. Russian scientists contested this conclusion, however, claiming it was the body of Maria that was missing. The Russians identified the body as that of Anastasia by using a computer program to compare photos of the youngest grand duchess with the skulls of the victims from the mass grave. They estimated the height and width of the skulls where pieces of bone were missing. American scientists found this method inexact.\nAmerican scientists thought the missing body to be Anastasia because none of the female skeletons showed the evidence of immaturity, such as an immature collarbone, undescended wisdom teeth, or immature vertebrae in the back, that they would have expected to find in a seventeen-year-old. In 1998, when the remains of the imperial family were finally interred, a body measuring approximately was buried under the name of Anastasia. Photographs taken of her standing beside her three sisters up until six months before the murders demonstrate that Anastasia was several inches shorter than all of them. Her mother commented on sixteen-year-old Anastasia's short stature in a 15 December 1917 letter, written seven months before the murders. \"Anastasia, to her despair, is now very fat, as Maria was, round and fat to the waist, with short legs. I do hope she will grow.\" Scientists considered it unlikely that the teenager could have grown so much in the last months of her life. Her actual height was approximately .\nThe account of the \"Yurovsky Note\" indicated that two of the bodies were removed from the main grave and cremated at an undisclosed area in order to further disguise the burials of the Tsar and his retinue if the remains were discovered by the Whites, since the body count would not be correct. Searches of the area in subsequent years failed to turn up a cremation site or the remains of the two missing Romanov children.\nOn 23 August 2007, a Russian archaeologist announced the discovery of two burned, partial skeletons at a bonfire site near Yekaterinburg that appeared to match the site described in Yurovsky's memoirs. The archaeologists said the bones were from a boy who was roughly between the ages of twelve and fifteen years at the time of his death and of a young woman who was roughly between the ages of fifteen and nineteen years old. Anastasia was seventeen years and one month old at the time of the assassination, while her sister Maria was nineteen years, one month old and her brother Alexei was two weeks shy of his fourteenth birthday. Anastasia's elder sisters Olga and Tatiana were twenty-two and twenty-one years old respectively at the time of the assassination. Along with the remains of the two bodies, archaeologists found \"shards of a container of sulfuric acid, nails, metal strips from a wooden box, and bullets of various caliber\". The site was initially found with metal detectors and by using metal rods as probes.\nDNA testing by multiple international laboratories including the Armed Forces DNA Identification Laboratory and Innsbruck Medical University confirmed that the remains belong to the Tsarevich Alexei and to one of his sisters, proving conclusively that all family members, including Anastasia, died in 1918. The parents and all five children are now accounted for, and each has his or her own unique DNA profile. While the tests have confirmed that all the Romanov bodies have been found, one of the studies was still unsure which body from the two graves was Maria's and which was Anastasia's:\na well publicized debate over which daughter, Maria (according to Russian experts) or Anastasia (according to US experts), has been recovered from the second grave cannot be settled based upon the DNA results reported here. In the absence of a DNA reference from each sister, we can only conclusively identify Alexei \u2013 the only son of Nicholas and Alexandra.\nSainthood.\nIn 2000, Anastasia and her family were canonized as passion bearers by the Russian Orthodox Church. The family had previously been canonized in 1981 by the Russian Orthodox Church Abroad as holy martyrs. The bodies of Tsar Nicholas II, Tsarina Alexandra, and three of their daughters were finally interred in the St. Catherine Chapel at Saints Peter and Paul Cathedral, St Petersburg on 17 July 1998, eighty years after they were murdered. As of 2018 the bones of Alexei and Maria (or possibly Anastasia) were still being held by the Orthodox Church.\nDepictions in art, media, and literature.\nThe purported survival of Anastasia has been the subject of cinema (such as the 1997 animated film and the 1956 film that inspired it starring Ingrid Bergman and Yul Brynner), made-for-television films, and a Broadway musical based on the 1997 animated film. The earliest, made in 1928, was called \"Clothes Make the Woman\". The story followed a woman who turns up to play the part of a rescued Anastasia for a Hollywood film, and ends up being recognized by the Russian soldier who originally rescued her from her would-be assassins.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The party was formed by a merger between the Minnesota Democratic Party and the Minnesota Farmer\u2013Labor Party in 1944. The DFL is one of two state Democratic Party affiliates with a different name from that of the national party, the other being the neighboring North Dakota Democratic\u2013Nonpartisan League Party.\nThe DFL controls four of Minnesota's eight United States House of Representatives seats, both of its United States Senate seats, the Minnesota Senate, and all other statewide offices, including the Governor of Minnesota, making it the dominant party in the state. In the Minnesota House of Representatives, it has a power-sharing agreement with its main political rival, the Republican Party of Minnesota, following a tie in the 2024 Minnesota House of Representatives election.\nHistory.\nBackground.\nThe Nonpartisan League (NPL), founded in North Dakota in 1915 was an agrarian party focused on farmer grievances against corporate monopolies. It expanded to Minnesota in 1917 and in 1918 it merged with the Duluth Union Labor Party to create the Farmer\u2013Labor Party (FLP). \nDuring the 1930s, the FLP gained support with radical platforms against economic and social inequalities. The party won the 1930 gubernatorial election under Floyd B. Olson. During this decade, Democrats had minimal success in the state now that the FLP effectively captured the left-wing vote and drew support away from urban workers, rural farmers, and immigrants. The party often won only single digits in statewide races as the FLP aligned informally with Roosevelt's New Deal coalition.\nBy 1938, the Farmer\u2013Labor party's influence waned because of internal conflicts and accusations of incompetence and corruption, leading to a loss in that year's gubernatorial election. The party suffered further setbacks in 1940 and 1942, losing congressional seats and the gubernatorial race.\nEstablishment.\nOn April 15, 1944, the Farmer\u2013Labor Party merged with the Minnesota Democratic Party, forming the Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party (DFL). Leading the merger effort were Elmer Kelm, the head of the Minnesota Democratic Party and the founding chairman of the DFL; Elmer Benson, effectively the head of the Farmer\u2013Labor Party by virtue of his leadership of its dominant left-wing faction; and rising star Hubert H. Humphrey, who chaired the Fusion Committee that accomplished the union and then went on to chair its first state convention. This merger marked a pivotal shift influenced by academic liberals at the University of Minnesota who advocated for integrating the New Deal's progressive reforms within a more centralized, managerial political framework, transitioning from the movement-oriented politics of the Farmer-Labor party to a structure that emphasized interest-group pluralism.\nDuring the post-war years, the DFL confronted various social issues, including antisemitism, which reflected broader national conversations about race and ethnicity. The DFL also navigated with its stance on civil rights and economic justice, influenced significantly by Minnesota's small but politically active African American communities. In early 1946, as a Fair Employment Practice (FEPC) bill was moving through Congress, there was a surge of civil rights activism in the Twin Cities.\nFactional battles were intensified by differing views on how to address the left-wing influence within the party, with significant conflicts between proponents of Henry A. Wallace's progressive policies and the more moderate wing led by figures like Hubert Humphrey. By the party's second convention in 1946, tensions had re-emerged between members of the two former parties. While the majority of delegates supported left-wing policies, Humphrey managed to install a more conservative, anti-communist ally, Orville Freeman, as party secretary. Some disaffected Farmer\u2013Labor leaders such as Benson moved to the Progressive Party. Freeman was elected the state's first DFL governor in 1954. Important members of the party have included Humphrey and Walter Mondale, who each went on to be United States senators, vice presidents of the United States, and unsuccessful Democratic nominees for president; Eugene McCarthy, a U.S. senator who ran for the Democratic presidential nomination in 1968 as an anti-Vietnam War candidate; Paul Wellstone, a U.S. senator from 1991 to 2002 who became an icon of populist progressivism; Amy Klobuchar, a U.S. senator who ran for the Democratic nomination for president in 2020; Dean Phillips, a U.S. representative who ran for the Democratic nomination for president in 2024; and Tim Walz, two-term governor chosen as Kamala Harris' running mate in the 2024 presidential election. The DFL has had varied success beginning in the late 1970s and through the late 2010s, in part due to the growth of single-issue splinter groups after reforms brought by the national party.\nModern.\nFollowing the 2022 Minnesota elections, the DFL became the dominant party in the state, retaining every executive office, winning majorities in the state House and Senate, and re-electing all incumbent congressional representatives. With their newly elected trifecta, the DFL pursued a progressive agenda in their first legislative session. Governor Tim Walz described the session as \"the most successful legislative session, certainly in many of our lifetimes and maybe in Minnesota history.\" The newly elected government passed large expansions in welfare programs and spending. Notable policies passed include the expansion of abortion rights, new programs to provide reproductive healthcare, protection of gender affirming care, the legalization of recreational cannabis, indexing education spending to inflation, investments in public transit, and paid sick leave for Minnesota workers. Former president Barack Obama praised the state government's actions, saying that \"Minnesota has made progress on a whole host of issues \u2013 from protecting abortion rights and new gun safety measures to expanding access to the ballot and reducing child poverty. These laws will make a real difference in the lives of Minnesotans.\"\nParty organization.\nThe DFL is governed by a state central committee, which is composed of representatives from each of the state's congressional districts. The state central committee is responsible for setting the party's platform, electing party officers, and conducting other party business. The DFL also has a constitution and bylaws that govern its operations.\nCommunity caucuses.\nThe party operates several community caucuses that organize and represent different communities within Minnesota; they not defined geographically. These include the:\nVoter base.\nThe DFL's base of support is diverse, and it includes urban and suburban voters, working class voters, labor unions, environmentalists, and other progressive groups. The party has a strong presence in the Twin Cities metropolitan area. The DFL has lost support in traditional DFL strongholds such as the Iron Range since 2016.\nCurrent elected officials.\nMembers of Congress.\nU.S. House of Representatives.\nOut of the eight seats Minnesota is apportioned in the U.S. House of Representatives, four are held by members of the DFL.\nLeadership.\nHistorical party chairs.\nThrough 1975, the party's constitution called for the election of a separate chairman and chairwoman to head state party activities. Only the chairman received compensation. In the mid-1970s, the party voted to change the titles of the chief party offices to chair and associate chair, specifying that they must both be salaried and must be of the opposite sex.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-begin/styles.css\"/&gt;\nElectoral history.\nFederal.\nU.S. Senate.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-begin/styles.css\"/&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

When sweep picking, the guitarist plays single notes on consecutive strings with a 'sweeping' motion of the pick, while using the fretting hand to produce a specific series of notes that are fast and fluid in sound. Both hands essentially perform an integral motion in unison to achieve the desired effect.\nHistory.\nThe technique was first used and developed by jazz guitarists Les Paul, Chet Atkins, Tal Farlow and Barney Kessel in the 1950s, as well as rock guitarists Jan Akkerman, Ritchie Blackmore and Steve Hackett in the 1970s. In the 1980s, sweep picking became widely known for its use by shred guitarists. Jazz fusion guitarist Frank Gambale released several books and instructional videos about the technique, of which the most well-known is \"Monster Licks &amp; Speed Picking\" in 1988.\nApplication.\nGuitarists often use the technique to play arpeggios at high speed. A common fretting shape is the one- or two-octave stacked triad. In scalar terms, this is the first (tonic), third (mediant) and fifth (dominant) of a scale, played twice, with an additional tonic added at the high end. For example, an A minor stacked triad is A-C-E-A-C-E-A. When the guitarist plays such a series of notes quickly up and down as an arpeggio, the phrasing sounds typical of pianos and other instruments more associated with such arpeggios. Unlike pianos, woodwinds, and many other instruments, the guitarist can change key by moving the same arpeggio shape up and down the fretboard.\nCompared to other techniques, such as alternate picking, sweep picking requires few strokes. In some instances, however, a guitarist uses hammer-ons and pull-offs to produce a legato sound instead of actual pick strokes. This applies when a certain string must sound two notes in the shape due to the natural limits of a fretted string instrument.\nHowever, as with all guitar techniques, individual players may integrate sweep picking into existing repertoire and use it in an individually stylistic manner. Therefore, some guitarists use legato techniques and others double-pick multiple notes on a single string. A guitarist may continue a sweep to the next note by tapping to play passing notes outside the classic arpeggio. Sweep picking is not limited to a few note patterns. Guitarists can construct as many patterns as there are chords, and apply sweep picking to any idea\u2014arpeggio or otherwise. These are separate yet related techniques that produce obvious differences in legato versus struck notes, as well as shift in the timing of the entire arpeggio. Furthering the idea, most players who master the basic sweep picking pattern use only parts of it, or alter the technique to achieve a certain lick. In this sense, sweep picking is not so much a concrete action such as the aforementioned alternate picking, but instead is a technical idea with many possible applications in all genres of music.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Most of its improvements were cosmetic or designed to improve the user experience, but there were also a handful of features introduced to enhance system functionality and capabilities, including improved USB support and accessibility, and support for hardware advancements such as DVD players. Windows 98 was the first edition of Windows to adopt the Windows Driver Model, and introduced features that would become standard in future generations of Windows, such as Disk Cleanup, Windows Update, multi-monitor support, and Internet Connection Sharing.\nMicrosoft had marketed Windows 98 as a \"tune-up\" to Windows 95, rather than an entirely improved next generation of Windows. Upon release, Windows 98 was generally well-received for its web-integrated interface and ease of use, as well as its addressing of issues present in Windows 95, although some pointed out that it was not significantly more stable than Windows 95. In 2003 Windows 98 had approximately 58 million users. It saw one major update, known as Windows 98 Second Edition (SE), released on June 10, 1999. After the release of its successor, Windows Me in 2000, mainstream support for Windows 98 and 98 SE ended on June 30, 2002, followed by extended support on July 11, 2006 along with Windows Me's end of extended support.\nDevelopment.\nFollowing the success of Windows 95, the development of Windows 98 began, initially under the development codename \"Memphis\". The first test version, Windows Memphis Developer Release, was released in January 1997.\nMemphis first entered beta as Windows Memphis Beta 1, released on June 30, 1997. It was followed by Windows 98 Beta 2, which dropped the Memphis name and was released in July. Microsoft had planned a full release of Windows 98 for the first quarter of 1998, along with a Windows 98 upgrade pack for Windows 95, but it also had a similar upgrade for Windows 3.x operating systems planned for the second quarter. Stacey Breyfogle, a product manager for Microsoft, explained that the later release of the upgrade for Windows 3 was because the upgrade required more testing than that for Windows 95 due to the presence of more compatibility issues, and without user objections, Microsoft merged the two upgrade packs into one and set all of their release dates to the second quarter.\nOn December 15, 1997, Microsoft released Windows 98 Beta 3. It was the first build to be able to upgrade from Windows 3.1x, and introduced new startup and shutdown sounds. Near its completion, Windows 98 Release Candidate was released on April 3, 1998, which expired on December 31 of the same year. This coincided with a notable press demonstration at COMDEX that month. Microsoft CEO Bill Gates was highlighting the operating system's ease of use and enhanced support for Plug and Play (PnP). However, when presentation assistant Chris Capossela plugged a Logitech PageScan USB scanner in, the operating system crashed, displaying a Blue Screen of Death. Bill Gates remarked after derisive applause and cheering from the audience, \"That must be why we're not shipping Windows 98 yet.\" Video footage of this event became a popular Internet phenomenon.\nBuild 1998 was compiled as Windows 98 on May 11, 1998, before being fully released to manufacturing on May 15. The company was facing pending legal action for allowing free downloads of, and planning to ship Windows licenses with, Internet Explorer 4.0 in an alleged effort to expand its software monopoly. Microsoft's critics believed the lawsuit would further delay Windows 98's public release; it did not, and the operating system was released on June 25, 1998.\nA second major version of the operating system called Windows 98 Second Edition was later unveiled in March 1999. Microsoft compiled the final build on April 23, 1999, before being fully released to manufacturing on May 5, and publicly released on June 10, 1999. Windows 98 was to be the final product in the Windows 9x line until Microsoft briefly revived the line to release Windows Me in 2000 as the final Windows 9x product before the introduction of Windows XP in 2001, which was based on the Windows NT architecture and kernel used in Windows 2000.\nNew and updated features.\nWeb integration and shell enhancements.\nThe first release of Windows 98 included Internet Explorer 4.01 SP1. This was updated to 5.0 in the Second Edition. Besides Internet Explorer, many other Internet companion applications are included such as Outlook Express, Windows Address Book, FrontPage Express, Microsoft Chat, Personal Web Server and a Web Publishing Wizard, and NetShow. NetMeeting allows multiple users to hold conference calls and work with each other on a document.\nThe Windows 98 shell is web-integrated; it contains deskbands, Active Desktop, Channels, ability to minimize foreground windows by clicking their button on the taskbar, single-click launching, Back and Forward navigation buttons, favorites, and address bar in Windows Explorer, image thumbnails, folder infotips and Web view in folders, and folder customization through HTML-based templates. The taskbar supports customizable toolbars designed to speed up access to the Web or the user's desktop; these toolbars include an Address Bar and Quick Launch. With the Address Bar, the user accesses the Web by typing in a URL, and Quick Launch contains shortcuts or buttons that perform system functions such as switching between windows and the desktop with the Show Desktop button. Another feature of this new shell is that dialog boxes show up in the Alt-Tab sequence.\nWindows 98 also integrates shell enhancements such as LiteStep, themes and other features from Microsoft Plus! for Windows 95 such as DriveSpace 3, Compression Agent, Dial-Up Networking Server, Dial-Up Scripting Tool and Task Scheduler. Windows 98 had its own separately purchasable Plus! pack, called Plus! 98.\nTitle bars of windows and dialog boxes support two-color gradients, a feature ported from and refined from Microsoft Office 95. Windows menus and tooltips support slide animation. Windows Explorer in Windows 98, as in Windows 95, converts all-uppercase filenames to sentence case for readability purposes; however, it also provides an option \"Allow all uppercase names\" to display them in their original case. Windows Explorer includes support for compressed CAB files. The \"Quick Res\" and \"Telephony Location Manager\" Windows 95 PowerToys are integrated into the core operating system.\nImprovements to hardware support.\nWindows Driver Model.\nWindows 98 was the first operating system to use the Windows Driver Model (WDM). This fact was not well publicized when Windows 98 was released, and most hardware producers continued to develop drivers for the older VxD driver standard, which Windows 98 supported for compatibility's sake. The WDM standard only achieved widespread adoption years later, mostly through Windows 2000 and Windows XP, as they were not compatible with the older VxD standard. With the Windows Driver Model, developers could write drivers that were compatible with other versions of Windows. Device driver access in WDM is implemented through a VxD device driver, codice_1, which implements several Windows NT-specific kernel support functions.\nSupport for WDM audio enables digital mixing, routing and processing of simultaneous audio streams, and kernel streaming with high-quality sample rate conversion on Windows 98. WDM Audio allows for software emulation of legacy hardware to support MS-DOS games, DirectSound support, and MIDI wavetable synthesis. The Windows 95 11-device limitation for MIDI devices is eliminated. A Microsoft GS Wavetable Synthesizer licensed from Roland shipped with Windows 98 for WDM audio drivers. Windows 98 supports digital playback of audio CDs, and the Second Edition improves WDM audio support by adding DirectSound hardware mixing and DirectSound 3D hardware abstraction, DirectMusic kernel support, KMixer sample-rate conversion for capture streams, and multichannel audio support. All audio is sampled by the Kernel Mixer to a fixed sampling rate, which may result in some audio getting upsampled or downsampled and having a high latency, except when using Kernel Streaming or third-party audio paths like ASIO which allow unmixed audio streams and lower latency. Windows 98 also includes a WDM streaming class driver (\"Stream.sys\") to address real time multimedia data stream processing requirements and a WDM kernel-mode video transport for enhanced video playback and capture.\nWindows Driver Model also includes Broadcast Driver Architecture, the backbone for TV technologies support in Windows. WebTV for Windows utilized BDA to allow viewing television on the computer if a compatible TV tuner card is installed. TV listings could be updated from the Internet and WaveTop Data Broadcasting allowed extra data about broadcasts to be received via regular television signals using an antenna or cable, by embedding data streams into the vertical blanking interval portion of existing broadcast television signals.\nOther device support improvements.\nWindows 98 had more robust USB support than Windows 95, which only had support in OEM versions OSR2.1 and later. Windows 98 supports USB hubs, USB scanners and imaging class devices. Windows 98 also introduced built-in support for some USB Human Interface Device class (USB HID) and PID class devices such as USB mice, keyboards, force feedback joysticks etc. including additional keyboard functions through a certain number of Consumer Page HID controls. Windows 98 also supports UDMA, 3DNow! and SSE.\nWindows 98 introduced ACPI 1.0 support which enabled \"Standby\" and \"Hibernate\" states. However, hibernation support was extremely limited and vendor-specific. Hibernation was only available if compatible (PnP) hardware and BIOS are present, and the hardware manufacturer or OEM supplied ACPI-compatible drivers. However, there are hibernation issues with the FAT32 file system, making hibernation problematic and unreliable.\nWindows 98, in general, provides improved \u2014 and a broader range of \u2014 support for IDE and SCSI drives and drive controllers, floppy drive controllers and all other classes of hardware as compared to Windows 95.&lt;ref name=\"98I/O\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; There is integrated Accelerated Graphics Port (AGP) support (although the USB Supplement to Windows 95 OSR2 and later releases of Windows 95 did have AGP support). Windows 98 has built-in DVD support and UDF 1.02 read support. The Still imaging architecture (STI) with TWAIN support was introduced for scanners and cameras and Image Color Management 2.0 for devices to perform color space transformations. Multiple monitor support allows using up to nine multiple monitors on a single PC, with the feature requiring one PCI graphics adapter per monitor. Windows 98 shipped with DirectX 5.2, which notably included DirectShow. Windows 98 Second Edition would later ship with DirectX 6.1.\nNetworking enhancements.\nWindows 98 networking enhancements to TCP/IP include built-in support for Winsock 2, SMB signing, a new IP Helper API, Automatic Private IP Addressing (also known as link-local addressing), IP multicasting, and performance enhancements for high-speed high bandwidth networks. Multihoming support with TCP/IP is improved and includes RIP listener support.\nThe DHCP client has been enhanced to include address assignment conflict detection and longer timeout intervals. NetBT configuration in the WINS client has been improved to continue persistently querying multiple WINS servers if it failed to establish the initial session until all of the WINS servers specified have been queried or a connection is established.\nNetwork Driver Interface Specification 4 support means Windows 98 can support a wide range of network media, including Ethernet, Fiber Distributed Data Interface (FDDI), Token Ring, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM), ISDN, wide area networks, X.25, and Frame Relay. Additional features include NDIS power management, support for quality of service, Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) and support for a single INF file format across all Windows versions.\nWindows 98 Dial-Up Networking supports PPTP tunneling, support for ISDN adapters, multilink support, and connection-time scripting to automate non-standard login connections. Multilink channel aggregation enables users to combine all available dial-up lines to achieve higher transfer speeds. PPP connection logs can show actual packets being passed and Windows 98 allows PPP logging per connection. The Dial-Up Networking improvements are also available in Windows 95 OSR2 and are downloadable for earlier Windows 95 releases.\nFor networked computers that have user profiles enabled, Windows 98 introduces Microsoft Family Logon which lists all users that have been configured for that computer, enabling users to simply select their names from a list rather than having to type them in.\nWindows 98 supports IrDA 3.0 which specifies both Serial Infrared Devices and Fast Infrared devices, which are capable of sending and receiving data at 4\u00a0Mbit/s. Infrared Recipient, a new application for transferring files through an infrared connection is included. The IrDA stack in Windows 98 supports networking profiles over the IrCOMM kernel-mode driver. Windows 98 also has built-in support for browsing Distributed File System trees on Server Message Block shares such as Windows NT servers.\nUPnP and NAT traversal APIs can be installed on Windows 98 by installing the Windows XP Network Setup Wizard. An L2TP/IPsec VPN client can also be downloaded. By installing Active Directory Client Extensions, Windows 98 can take advantage of several Windows 2000 Active Directory features.\nImprovements to the system and built-in utilities.\nPerformance improvements.\nWindows 95 introduced the 32-bit, protected-mode cache driver VCACHE (replacing SMARTDrv) to cache the most recently accessed information from the hard drive in memory, divided into chunks. However, the cache parameters needed manual tuning as it degraded performance by consuming too much memory and not releasing it quickly enough, forcing paging to occur far too early. The Windows 98 VCACHE cache size management for disk and network access, CD-ROM access and paging is more dynamic compared to Windows 95, resulting in no tuning being required for cache parameters. On the FAT32 file system, Windows 98 has a performance feature called MapCache that can run applications from the disk cache itself if the code pages of executable files are aligned/mapped on 4K boundaries, instead of copying them to virtual memory. This results in more memory being available to run applications, and lesser usage of the swap file.\nWindows 98 registry handling is more robust than Windows 95 to avoid corruption and there are several enhancements to eliminate limitations and improve registry performance. The Windows 95 registry key size limitation of 64\u00a0KB is gone. The registry uses less memory and has better caching.\nDisk Defragmenter has been improved to rearrange program files that are frequently used to a hard disk region optimized for program start. Despite this, the quirk of the hard drive being rescanned if the contents of the hard drive had changed (denoted by the message \"Drive contents changed...restarting.\") is still present in this version, and remains identical to that of Windows 95. If it gets stuck on the same area too many times, the program would then ask the user to either continue scanning or give up. This quirk was removed with Windows Me's version of Disk Defragmenter, which can also work on Windows 98 or Windows 95 if it is simply copied over.\nWindows 98 also supports a \"Fast Shutdown\" feature that initiates shutdown without uninitializing device drivers. However, this can cause Windows 98 to hang instead of shutting down the computer if a buggy driver is active, so Microsoft supplied instructions for disabling the feature. Windows 98 supports write-behind caching for removable disk drives. A utility for converting FAT16 partitions to FAT32 without formatting the partition is also included, however it is not compatible with DriveSpace.\nOther system tools.\nA number of improvements are made to various other system tools and accessories in Windows 98. Microsoft Backup supports differential backup and SCSI tape devices in Windows 98. Disk Cleanup, a new tool, enables users to clear their disks of unnecessary files. Cleanup locations are extensible through Disk Cleanup handlers. Disk Cleanup can be automated for regular silent cleanups.\nScanreg (DOS) and ScanRegW are Registry Checker tools used to back up, restore or optimize the Windows registry. ScanRegW tests the registry's integrity and saves a backup copy each time Windows successfully boots. The maximum number of copies could be customized by the user through \"scanreg.ini\" file. The restoration of a registry that causes Windows to fail to boot can only be done from DOS mode using ScanReg.\nSystem Configuration Utility is a new system utility used to disable programs and services that are not required to run the computer. A Maintenance Wizard is included that schedules and automates ScanDisk, Disk Defragmenter and Disk Cleanup. Windows Script Host, with VBScript and JScript engines is built-in and upgradeable to version 5.6. System File Checker checks installed versions of system files to ensure they were the same version as the one installed with Windows 98 or newer. Corrupt or older versions are replaced by the correct versions. This tool was introduced to resolve the DLL hell issue and was replaced in Windows Me by System File Protection.\nWindows 98 Setup simplifies installation, reducing the bulk of user input required. The Windows 98 Startup Disk contains generic, real-mode ATAPI and SCSI CD-ROM drivers that can be used instead in the event that the specific driver for a CD-ROM is unavailable.\nThe system could be updated using Windows Update. A utility to automatically notify the user of critical updates was later released.\nWindows 98 includes an improved version of the Dr. Watson utility that collects and lists comprehensive information such as running tasks, startup programs with their command line switches, system patches, kernel driver, user drivers, DOS drivers and 16-bit modules. With Dr. Watson loaded in the system tray, whenever a software fault occurs (general protection fault, hang, etc.), Dr. Watson will intercept it and indicate what software crashed and its cause.\nWindows Report Tool takes a snapshot of system configuration and lets users submit a manual problem report along with system information to technicians. It has e-mail confirmation for submitted reports.\nAccessories.\nWindows 98 includes Microsoft Magnifier, Accessibility Wizard and Microsoft Active Accessibility 1.1 API (upgradeable to MSAA 2.0.) A new HTML Help system with 15 Troubleshooting Wizards was introduced to replace WinHelp.\nUsers can configure the font in Notepad. Microsoft Paint supports GIF transparency. HyperTerminal supports a TCP/IP connection method, which allows it to be used as a Telnet client. Imaging for Windows is updated. System Monitor\u2014used to track the performance of hardware and software\u2014supports output to a log file.\nWindows 98 Second Edition.\nWindows 98 Second Edition (often shortened to Windows 98 SE and sometimes to Win98 SE or 98 SE) is an updated version of Windows 98 released on June 10, 1999, about eight months before the release of the business-oriented Windows 2000. It includes many bug fixes, improved WDM audio and modem support, improved USB support, added SSE2 support, the replacement of Internet Explorer 4.0 with Internet Explorer 5.0, \"Web Folders\" (WebDAV namespace extension for Windows Explorer), and related shell updates. Also included is basic OHCI-compliant FireWire DV camcorder support (MSDV class driver) and SBP-2 support for mass storage class devices. Wake-On-LAN reenables suspended networked computers due to network activity, and Internet Connection Sharing allows multiple networked client computers to share an Internet connection via a single host computer.\nOther features in the update include DirectX 6.1 which introduced major improvements to DirectSound and the introduction of DirectMusic, improvements to Asynchronous Transfer Mode support (IP/ATM, PPP/ATM and WinSock 2/ATM support), Windows Media Player 6.1 replacing the older Media Player 4.1, Microsoft NetMeeting 3.0, MDAC 2.1 and WMI. A memory overflow issue was resolved in which earlier versions of Windows 98 would crash most systems if left running for 49.7 days (equal to 232 milliseconds); this bug was also present on its predecessor, Windows 95. Windows 98 SE could be obtained as retail upgrade and full version packages, as well as OEM and a Second Edition Updates Disc for existing Windows 98 users. USB audio device class support is present from Windows 98 SE onwards. Windows 98 Second Edition improved WDM support in general for all devices, and it introduced support for WDM for modems (and therefore USB modems and virtual COM ports). However, Microsoft driver support for both USB printers and USB mass-storage device class is not available for Windows 98.\nRemoved features.\nThe Active Channels Channel bar from the original release of Windows 98 is not installed upon first boot, however it is retained when upgrading from the original release of Windows 98 to Windows 98 Second Edition.\nWindows 98 Second Edition did not ship with the WinG API or RealPlayer 4.0, unlike the original release of Windows 98, due to both of these having been superseded by DirectX and Windows Media Player, respectively. On the other hand, ActiveMovie still exists in Windows 98 Second Edition despite having been superseded by Windows Media Player.\nUpgradeability.\nSeveral components of Windows 98 can be updated to newer versions. These include:\nSystem requirements.\nThe majority of copies of Windows 98 were distributed in CD-ROM format. A &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;3+1\u20442-inch floppy disk version was available for older machines, albeit only via mail order. The floppy disk version of Windows 98 came on 39 DMF formatted floppy disks and excluded some additional software components that the CD-ROM version might have featured. The original release of Windows 98 was the last version of Windows to be available on floppy disks, as Windows 98 Second Edition was only available on CD-ROMs. Microsoft Plus! for Windows 98 was also only available on CD-ROMs.\nThe two major versions of Windows 98 have minimum requirements needed to be run.\nUsers can bypass processor requirement checks with the undocumented /NM setup switch. This allows installation on computers with processors as old as the Intel 80386.\nLimitations.\nThe original release of Windows 98 may fail to boot on computers with a processor faster than 2.1\u00a0GHz. The Active Channels Channel bar will also not set up properly on computers with a processor faster than 1.5\u00a0GHz.\nWindows 98 is only designed to handle up to 512\u00a0MB of physical memory (RAM) without changes; the maximum amount of RAM the operating system is designed to use is up to 1\u00a0GB of memory. Systems with more than 1.5\u00a0GB of memory may continuously reboot during startup.\nWindows 98 may have problems running on hard drives of capacities larger than 32\u00a0GB in systems with certain Phoenix BIOS configurations. A software update fixed this shortcoming.\nSupport lifecycle.\nComputers running Windows 98 can be directly upgraded to Windows XP, providing they meet the requirements for Windows XP. Support for Windows 98 under Microsoft's consumer product life cycle policy was originally planned to end on June 30, 2003, however, in December 2002, Microsoft extended the support window to January 16, 2004. This date would then be extended again to June 30, 2006 on January 13, 2004 up to a final end of support date of July 11, 2006, citing support volumes in emerging markets as the reason for the extension.\nRetail availability for Windows 98 ended on June 30, 2002, and later became completely unavailable from Microsoft in any form (through MSDN or otherwise) due to the terms of Java-related settlements Microsoft made with Sun Microsystems.\nIn 2011, Microsoft retired the Windows Update v4 website. An independent project named Windows Update Restored aims to restore the Windows Update websites for older versions of Windows, including Windows 98.\nReception.\nWindows 98 was released to positive reviews, with praise directed to its improved graphical user interface and customizability, ease of use, and the degree to which it addressed complaints that users and critics had with Windows 95. Michael Sweet of \"Smart Computing\" characterized it as heavily integrating features of the web browser, and found file and folder navigation easier. Ed Bott of \"PC Computing\" lauded the bug fixes, easier troubleshooting, and support for hardware advances such as DVD players and USB. However, he also found that the operating system crashed only slightly less frequently, and criticized the high upgrade price and system requirements. He rated it four stars out of five.\nSales.\nWindows 98 sold 530,000 licenses in its first four days of availability, overtaking Windows 95's 510,000. It later sold a total of 580,000 and 350,000 licenses in the first and second months of availability, respectively.\nIn the first year of its release, Windows 98 sold a total of 15 million licenses \u2013 2 million more than its predecessor. However, International Data Corporation estimated that of the roughly 89 million shipped computers in the desktop market, the operating system had a market share of 17.2 percent, compared to Windows 95's 57.4 percent. Meanwhile, the two operating systems continued to observe a trend whereby Windows 98 improved in sales performance, whereas Windows 95 dwindled. After a legal dispute and subsequent settlement with Sun Microsystems over the former's Java Virtual Machine, Microsoft ceased distributing the operating system on December 15, 2003, and IDC estimated that a total of 58 million copies were installed worldwide by then.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "75434", "revid": "24871961", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=75434", "title": "Mauretania", "text": "Region in the ancient Maghreb\nMauretania (; ) is the Latin name for a region in the ancient Maghreb. It extended from central present-day Algeria to the Atlantic, encompassing northern present-day Morocco, and from the Mediterranean in the north to the Atlas Mountains. Its native inhabitants, of Berber ancestry, were known to the Romans as the Mauri and the Masaesyli.\nIn 25 BC, the kings of Mauretania became Roman vassals until about 44 AD, when the area was annexed to Rome and divided into two provinces: Mauretania Tingitana and Mauretania Caesariensis. Christianity spread there from the 3rd century onwards. After the Muslim Arabs subdued the region in the 7th century, Islam became the dominant religion.\nMoorish kingdom.\nMauretania existed as a tribal kingdom of the Berber Mauri people. In the early 1st century Strabo recorded \"Ma\u00fbroi\" (\u039c\u03b1\u1fe6\u03c1\u03bf\u03b9 in Greek) as the native name of a people opposite the Iberian Peninsula. This appellation was adopted into Latin, whereas the Greek name for the tribe was \"Mauro\u00fasii\" (\u039c\u03b1\u03c5\u03c1\u03bf\u03cd\u03c3\u03b9\u03bf\u03b9). The Mediterranean coast of Mauretania had commercial harbours for trade with Carthage from before the 4th century BC, but the interior was controlled by Berber tribes, who had established themselves in the region by the Iron Age.\nKing Atlas was a legendary king of Mauretania credited with inventing the celestial globe. The first known historical king of the Mauri, Baga, ruled during the Second Punic War of 218\u2013201 BC. The Mauri were in close contact with Numidia. Bocchus I ([fl.] 110 BC) was father-in-law to the redoubted Numidian king Jugurtha.\nAfter the death of king Bocchus II in 33 BC Rome directly administered the region from 33 BC to 25 BC. Mauretania eventually became a client kingdom of the Roman Empire in 25 BC when the Romans installed Juba II of Numidia as their client-king. Around 25 BC Juba sent an expedition to the Canary Islands. On his death in AD 23, his Roman-educated son Ptolemy of Mauretania succeeded him. The Emperor Caligula had Ptolemy executed in AD 40. The Roman Emperor Claudius annexed Mauretania directly as a Roman province in AD 44, placing it under an imperial governor (either a \"procurator Augusti\", or a \"legatus Augusti pro praetore\").\nRoman province(s).\nIn the 1st century AD, Emperor Claudius divided the Roman province of Mauretania into Mauretania Caesariensis and Mauretania Tingitana along the line of the Mulucha (Muluya) River, about 60\u00a0km west of modern Oran:\nMauretania gave the empire one emperor, the equestrian Macrinus. He seized power after the assassination of Caracalla in 217 but was himself defeated and executed by Elagabalus the next year.\nEmperor Diocletian's Tetrarchy reform (293) further divided the area into three provinces, as the small, easternmost region of Sitifensis was split off from Mauretania Caesariensis.\nThe \"Notitia Dignitatum\" (c. 400) mentions them as still existing, two being under the authority of the Vicarius of the diocese of Africa: \nAnd, under the authority of the\" Vicarius\" of the diocese of Hispaniae: \nLate Antiquity.\nMauro-Roman Kingdom.\nDuring the crisis of the 3rd century, parts of Mauretania were reconquered by Berber tribes. Direct Roman rule became confined to a few coastal cities (such as Septem in Mauretania Tingitana and Cherchell in Mauretania Caesariensis) by the late 3rd century.\nHistorical sources about inland areas are sparse, but these were apparently controlled by local Berber rulers who, however, maintained a degree of Roman culture, including the local cities, and usually nominally acknowledged the suzerainty of the Roman Emperors.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The Western kingdom more distant from the Vandal kingdom was the one of Altava, a city located at the borders of Mauretania Tingitana and Caesariensis...It is clear that the Mauro-Roman kingdom of Altava was fully inside the Western Latin world, not only because of location but mainly because it adopted the military-religious-sociocultural-administrative organization of the Roman Empire...\nIn an inscription from Altava in western Algeria, one of these rulers, Masuna, described himself as \"rex gentium Maurorum et Romanorum\" (king of the Roman and Moorish peoples). Altava was later the capital of another ruler, Garmul or Garmules, who resisted Byzantine rule in Africa but was finally defeated in 578.\nThe Byzantine historian Procopius also mentions another independent ruler, Mastigas, who controlled most of Mauretania Caesariensis in the 530s. In the 7th century there were eight Romano-Moorish kingdoms: Altava, Ouarsenis, Hodna, Aures, Nemenchas, Capsa, Dorsale, and Cabaon.\nThe last resistance against the Arab invasion was sustained in the second half of the 7th century mainly by the Roman-Moorish kingdoms -with the last Byzantine troops in the region- under the leadership of the Christian king of Altava Caecilius, but later ended in complete defeat in 703 AD (when the queen Kahina died in battle).\nVandal kingdom.\nThe Vandals conquered the Roman province beginning in the 420s. \nThe city of Hippo Regius fell to the Vandals in 431 after a prolonged siege, and Carthage also fell in 439. Theodosius II dispatched an expedition to deal with the Vandals in 441, which failed to progress farther than Sicily. The Western Empire under Valentinian III secured peace with the Vandals in 442, confirming their control of Proconsular Africa. For the next 90 years, Africa was firmly under the Vandal control. The Vandals were ousted from Africa in the Vandalic War of 533\u2013534, from which time Mauretania at least nominally became a Roman province once again.\nThe old provinces of the Roman Diocese of Africa were mostly preserved by the Vandals, but large parts, including almost all of Mauretania Tingitana, much of Mauretania Caesariensis and Mauretania Sitifensis and large parts of the interior of Numidia and Byzacena, had been lost to the inroads of Berber tribes, now collectively called the \"Mauri\" (later Moors) as a generic term for \"the Berber tribes in the province of Mauretania\".\nPraetorian prefecture of Africa.\nIn 533, the Roman army under Belisarius defeated the Vandals. In April 534, Justinian published a law concerning the administrative organization of the newly acquired territories. Nevertheless, Justinian restored the old administrative division, but raised the overall governor at Carthage to the supreme administrative rank of praetorian prefect, thereby ending the Diocese of Africa's traditional subordination to the Prefecture of Italy (then still under Ostrogoth rule).\nExarchate of Africa.\nThe emperor Maurice sometime between 585 and 590 AD created the office of \"Exarch\", which combined the supreme civil authority of a praetorian prefect and the military authority of a \"magister militum\", and enjoyed considerable autonomy from Constantinople. Two exarchates were established, one in Italy, with seat at Ravenna (hence known as the Exarchate of Ravenna), and one in Africa, based at Carthage and including all imperial possessions in the Western Mediterranean. The first African exarch was the \"patricius\" Gennadius.\nMauretania Caesariensis and Mauretania Sitifensis were merged to form the new province of Mauretania Prima, while Mauretania Tingitana, effectively reduced to the city of Septem, was combined with the citadels of the Spanish coast (Spania) and the Balearic Islands to form Mauretania Secunda. The African exarch was in possession of \"Mauretania Secunda\", which was little more than a tiny outpost in southern Spain, beleaguered by the Visigoths. \nThe last Spanish strongholds were conquered by the Visigoths in 624 AD, reducing \"Mauretania Seconda\" opposite Gibraltar to only the fort of Septem.\nReligion.\nChristianity is known to have existed in Mauretania as early as the 3rd century.

In 1968 Ortolani moved to Parma, where he still lives with his wife Caterina and his adoptive daughters Johanna and Lucy Maria.\nFrom an early age, Ortolani showed a great passion for the world of comic books, and in particular\" The Fantastic Four\" by Jack Kirby and Stan Lee, which will affect its style of narrative.\nAfter finishing high school, he enrolled at the University of Parma to study Geology. While at university, Ortolani draws his characters first, and the theme of geology became a catchphrase of the first issues of his major work,\" Rat-Man\".\nCareer.\nFirst works and the creation of Rat-Man.\nIn 1989 joined publishing house\" Comic Art\" to work on two stories: the tragic and the other comic. Publisher Rinaldo Traini published the comic story on the second\" Spot\" (supplement of\" Eternauta\" dedicated to beginners), marking the Birth of Rat-Man.\n\" The shocking origins of Rat-Man\" earned Ortolani an award for best newcomer by Lucca Comics of 1990. With this visibility, Leo began to collaborate with magazines and independent fanzines.\nFor the fanzine\"Made in USA\" he created two more stories starring Rat-Man (\" Topin! The Wonder Mouse!\" And\" From the Future\") and several parodies of superheroes (including X-Men, Fantastic Four and Superman).\nThe most important works of this cycle are his four parodies of the Fantastic Four. Kirby stopped drawing\" Fantastic Four\" at issue #102. Ortolani wrote numbers 103-106, completely upsetting the group.\nCalled to military service in the Air Force, Ortolani drew inspiration from life in the barracks, gathering his experiences in a detailed diary that became the starting point for\" The last rookie\", a strip on military life (the same as the protagonist Ortolani) which were published as an appendix to\" Storm Trooper\".\nDuring this period, Ortolani also collaborated on the \"Starcom\u00ecx\" humor magazine directed by Luca Boschi and published by Star Comics in \"Totem Comic\" and \"Totem Extra\", where he made\" The impervious\", \"Clan\", \"The wonder of nature\" and \"The wonders of technology\". In this period he also stripped the series \"Those of Parma\", published in the \"Gazzetta di Parma\", speaking of the city of Parma and its inhabitants, a selection of which was collected in the volume \"Editions Bands Dessin\u00e9e\". The short stories of the series of \"Wonderland\" were taken years later, collected in three volumes by Panini Comics.\nPopularity and the contract with Marvel Italia.\nIn 1995 Leo Ortolani published \"Venerd\u00ec 12\" as a series of the comic magazine L'isola che non c'\u00e8. That same year, Ortolani chose to self-publish the comic book series \"Rat-Man\" alongside his primary job as a geologist; however, in 1997 Leo signed a contract with Marvel Italia, today a brand owned by Panini Comics (and, at the time, a branch of Marvel Comics itself), to publish the comic under the Marvel brand, which allowed Leonardo to become a full-time comics author. The contract also allowed him to use popular Marvel characters like Spider-Man, Captain America, Wolverine, Doctor Doom and Elektra in Rat-Man stories; however, copyright problems have since prohibited such use of characters in the Rat-Man world.\nSuccessful parodies.\nOrtolani created several popular parodies of famous works of fiction and blockbusters in his Rat-Man stories. In 1999 Leo Ortolani created \"Star Rats\", a parody of \"Star Wars\". In 2004 he created \"Il Signore dei Ratti\", a parody of \"The Lord of the Rings\" trilogy. In 2005 Ortolani published \"Star Rats - Episodio I\", a parody of ', which was the best selling Panini Comics book in the release month. In 2007 Ortolani created \"299+1\", a parody of \"300\" and one of his best works. In 2009 he created \"Ratto\", a parody of \"Rambo\" films. In 2010 he published \"Avarat\", a parody of \"Avatar\". In 2011 Leo Ortolani created \"La Quadrilogia dei Sacrificabili\", a parody of \"The Expendables\" series, that won the award \"Fede a strisce 2011\" at RiminiComix. In 2012 he created \"Il Grande Magazzi\", a parody of \"Harry Potter\" and \"Twilight\" series. That same year he published also \"Allen\", a parody of \"Alien\". In 2014 Leo Ortolani published \"Star Rats - Episodio II\", a parody of ', and then soon after in 2015 he published also \"Star Rats - Episodio III\", a parody of \"\".\nThe end of the series \"Rat-Man\".\nIn 2016 Ortolani stated his intention to close the series \"Rat-Man\" with issue #122, which was published around September 2017.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

This was the second of six case histories that Freud published and the first in which he claimed that the patient had been cured by psychoanalysis.\nThe nickname derives from the fact that among the patient's many compulsions was an obsession with nightmarish fantasies about rats.\nTo protect the anonymity of patients, psychoanalytic case studies usually withheld or disguised the names of the individuals concerned (Anna O., Little Hans, Wolf Man, Dora, etc.). Recent researchers have determined that the \"Rat Man\" was in fact a lawyer named Ernst Lanzer (1878\u20131914)\u2014though many other sources maintain that the man's name was Paul Lorenz.\nHistory of the analysis.\nLanzer first came to Freud in October 1907 complaining of obsessive fears and compulsive impulses. Freud treated his patient for a little over three months on a regular daily basis. The treatment was irregular for the next three months and sporadic, at best, after that.\nLanzer's principal fear was that something terrible was going to happen to his father and a female friend (who later became his wife). His fear had grown out of an account he heard from a fellow army officer concerning a Chinese torture method in which a large pot containing a live rat was strapped to the buttocks of the victim, and the rat, encouraged by a red-hot poker, would gnaw its way out through the victim's anus.\nLanzer claimed that he fantasized about murder and suicide, and he developed a number of compulsive irrational behavior patterns. For example, he mentioned his habit of opening the door to his flat between 12 midnight and 1:00 A.M., apparently so that his father's ghost could enter. Lanzer would then stare at his penis, sometimes using a mirror.\nFreud encouraged Lanzer to discuss details of his sex life (such as his first efforts at masturbation at age 21) and focused on a number of verbal associations with the word \"Ratten\" (\"rats\"). \nLanzer introduced Freud to Friedrich Nietzsche's phrase (which Freud later cited) \"'I did this,' says my Memory. 'I cannot have done this,' says my Pride, and remains inexorable. In the end \u2013 Memory yields.\" Freud retold the saying more than once, and it was used by later therapists such as Fritz Perls.\nLanzer broke off his analysis with Freud after a relatively brief period and well before his transference had been fully resolved. Just after Freud had completed the written version of the case history in October 1909, he confessed to Carl Jung that his patient was having ongoing problems. Lanzer was killed in World War I, and later researchers were unable to interview him.\nFreud's write-up: \"Notes Upon a Case of Obsessional Neurosis\".\nFreud was led to publish the Rat Man case history because he was feeling pressured to show the world that psychoanalysis could achieve successful therapeutic results. Because the Rat Man previously consulted Julius von Wagner-Jauregg, Freud's eminent psychiatric colleague at the University of Vienna, the case was a particularly critical test of Freud's therapeutic abilities. Before October 1908, when he communicated this case history at the first International Psychoanalytic Congress in Salzburg, Austria, Freud had yet to publish the results of a successful psychoanalysis.\nThe case study was published in 1909 in Germany. Freud saw the Rat Man patient for some six months despite later claiming the treatment lasted about a year. He considered the treatment a success.\nThe patient presented with obsessional thoughts and with behaviors that he felt compelled to carry out, which had been precipitated by the loss/replacement of his pince-nez and the problem of paying for them, combined with the impact of a story he heard from a fellow officer about a torture wherein rats would eat their way into the anal cavity of the victim. The patient then felt a compulsion to imagine that this fate was befalling two people dear to him, specifically his father and his fianc\u00e9e. The irrational nature of this obsession is revealed by the fact that the man had the greatest regard for his fianc\u00e9e and that his revered father had been dead for some years. Freud theorized that these obsessive ideas and similar thoughts were produced by conflicts consisting of the combination of loving and aggressive impulses relating to the people concerned \u2013 what Eugen Bleuler later called ambivalence.\nThe Rat Man often defended himself against his own thoughts. He had had a secret thought that he wished his father would die so he could inherit all of his money and become rich enough to marry, before shaming himself by fantasizing that his father would die and leave him nothing. The patient even goes so far as to fantasize about marrying Freud's daughter, believing (Freud writes) that \"the only reason I was so kind and incredibly patient with him was that I wanted to have him for a son-in-law\" \u2013 a matter linked in the transference to his conflicts between his mother's wish for him to marry rich like his father and his fianc\u00e9e's poverty.\nIn addition, the symptoms were believed to keep the patient from needing to make difficult decisions in his current life, and to ward off the anxiety that would be involved in experiencing the angry and aggressive impulses directly. The patient's older sister and father had died, and these losses were considered, along with his suicidal thoughts and his tendency, to form part of the tissue of phantasies, verbal associations and symbolic meanings in which he was trapped. Freud believed that they had their origin in the Rat Man's sexual experiences of infancy, in particular harsh punishment for childhood masturbation, and the vicissitudes of sexual curiosity.\nIn the theoretical second part of the case study, Freud elaborates on such defence mechanisms as \"rationalization\", \"doubt\", undoing and \"displacement\".\nIn a later footnote, Freud laments that although \"the patient's mental health was restored to him by the analysis ... like so many young men of value and promise, he perished in the Great War\".\nA number of significant discrepancies between the published case history and Freud's process notes, which were discovered among his papers after his death, have been pointed out by Patrick Mahony. According to Mahony, who is an analyst and sympathetic to the general goals of psychoanalysis, Freud's published case history is \"muddled\" and \"inconsistent\" on various matters of fact and also exhibits \"glaring\" omissions of information. In particular, there is an overemphasis on the father to the exclusion of the mother. Mahony states \"Freud mixed momentous insights with exaggerated claims,\" some of which \"were made in his zeal to protect and promote a new discipline.\"\nLegacy.\nJacques Lacan built his early structuralist theory around the Rat Man case, in particular the polarity of father\u2013rich wife/son\u2013poor wife as an intergenerational force creating the individual neurosis.\nFreud's late note upon the Rat Man's acute sense of smell would later be developed into his theory of the process of civilisation and organic repression.\nCriticism of Freud.\nPeter Gay concluded in \"\" (1988) that \"apart from a handful of interesting deviations, the case history Freud published generally followed the process notes he made every night\". Patrick Mahony, a psychoanalyst and professor of English at the University of Montreal, has highlighted such discrepancies in his detailed study \"Freud and the Rat Man,\" published in 1986 by the Yale University Press.\nDr. Mahony said Freud seems to have consistently implied that the case lasted longer than it actually did. He also said Freud claimed in a lecture to be able to guess the name of the Rat Man's girlfriend, Gisela, from an anagram, \"Glejisamen\", which the patient had invented. Actually, the notes show Freud had learned her name first, and then used it to deduce the meaning of the anagram, although in the actual case study Freud merely states that \"when he told it to me, I could not help noticing that the word was in fact an anagram of the name of his lady\".\nCritics have objected to Freud's downplaying of the role of the Rat Man's mother, and for several deviations on his part from what later became standard psychoanalytic practice.\nEfficacy of the treatment.\nMahoney accepted that Freud obtained a degree of success in restoring his patient to functional life, though he considered Freud exaggerated the extent of this in his case study. Others have suggested that by concentrating on building rapport with his patient, at the expense of analyzing the negative transference, Freud merely achieved a temporary transference cure. Lacan for his part concluded that although he did not \"regard the Rat Man as a case that Freud cured\", in it \"Freud made the fundamental discoveries, which we are still living off, concerning the dynamics and structure of obsessional neurosis\".\nIn a letter Freud wrote to Jung, shortly after publication of the case study, he claimed of the Rat Man that \"he is facing life with courage and ability. The one point that still gives him trouble (father-complex and transference) has shown up clearly in my conversations with this intelligent and grateful man\" \u2013 a not insignificant reservation. But while Freud in the case-history had certainly claimed that \"the patient's rat delirium had disappeared\", he had also pointed out the limited time and depth of the analysis: \"The patient recovered, and his ordinary life began to assert its claims...which were incompatible with a continuation of the treatment\".\nAs the average length of time expected of an analysis increased from months to years over the 20th century, so too the success of the Rat Man's case has perhaps come to resemble rather the symptomatic relief of brief psychotherapy or focal psychotherapy, more than the achievement of a full psychoanalysis.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\nMark Kanzer/Jules Glenn, \"Freud and His Patients\" (1980)"}

He tries many approaches, failing miserably, until Bedelia accepts his court in order to win a bet. So Aldo, full of joy, decides to buy her, as a birthday gift, a music box.

{"id": "75450", "revid": "3534742", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=75450", "title": "Metamerism (color)", "text": "Perceived matching of colors in colorimetry\nIn colorimetry, metamerism is a perceived matching of colors with different (nonmatching) spectral power distributions. Colors that match this way are called metamers.\nA spectral power distribution describes the proportion of total light given off (emitted, transmitted, or reflected) by a color sample at each visible wavelength; it defines the complete information about the light coming from the sample. However, the human eye contains only three color receptors (three types of cone cells), which means that all colors are reduced to three sensory quantities, called the tristimulus values. Metamerism occurs because each type of cone responds to the cumulative energy from a broad range of wavelengths, so that different combinations of light across all wavelengths can produce an equivalent receptor response and the same tristimulus values or color sensation. In color science, the set of sensory spectral sensitivity curves is numerically represented by color matching functions.\nSources of metamerism.\nMetameric matches are quite common, especially in near neutral (grayed or whitish colors) or dark colors. As colors become brighter or more saturated, the range of possible metameric matches (different combinations of light wavelengths) becomes smaller, especially in colors from surface reflectance spectra.\nMetameric matches made between two light sources provide the trichromatic basis of colorimetry. The basis for nearly all commercially available color image reproduction processes such as photography, television, printing, and digital imaging, is the ability to make metameric color matches.\nMaking metameric matches using reflective materials is more complex. The appearance of surface colors is defined by the product of the spectral reflectance curve of the material and the spectral emittance curve of the light source shining on it. As a result, the color of surfaces depends on the light source used to illuminate them.\nMetameric failure.\nThe term illuminant metameric failure or illuminant metamerism is sometimes used to describe situations in which two material samples match when viewed under one light source but not another. Most types of fluorescent lights produce an irregular or peaky spectral emittance curve, so that two materials under fluorescent light might not match, even though they are a metameric match to an incandescent \"white\" light source with a nearly flat or smooth emittance curve. Material colors that match under one source will often appear different under the other. Inkjet printing is particularly susceptible, and inkjet proofs are best viewed under a 5000K color temperature lighting source, with good color rendering properties, for color accuracy.\nNormally, material attributes such as translucency, gloss or surface texture are not considered in color matching. However geometric metameric failure or geometric metamerism can occur when two samples match when viewed from one angle, but then fail to match when viewed from a different angle. A common example is the color variation that appears in pearlescent automobile finishes or \"metallic\" paper; e.g., Kodak Endura Metallic, Fujicolor Crystal Archive Digital Pearl.\nObserver metameric failure or observer metamerism can occur because of differences in color vision between observers. The common source of observer metameric failure is colorblindness, but it can also occur among \"normal\" observers. In all cases, the proportion of long-wavelength-sensitive cones to medium-wavelength-sensitive cones in the retina, the profile of light sensitivity in each type of cone, and the amount of yellowing in the lens and macular pigment of the eye, differs from one person to the next. This alters the relative importance of different wavelengths in a spectral power distribution to each observer's color perception. As a result, two spectrally dissimilar lights or surfaces may produce a color match for one observer but fail to match when viewed by a second observer.\nField-size metameric failure or field-size metamerism occurs because the relative proportions of the three cone types in the retina vary from the center of the visual field to the periphery, so that colors that match when viewed as very small, centrally fixated areas may appear different when presented as large color areas. In many industrial applications, large-field color matches are used to define color tolerances.\nFinally, device metamerism comes up due to the lack of consistency of colorimeters of the same or different manufacturers. Colorimeters basically consist of a combination of a matrix of sensor cells and optical filters, which present an unavoidable variance in their measurements. Moreover, devices built by different manufacturers can differ in their construction.\nThe difference in the spectral compositions of two metameric stimuli is often referred to as the degree of metamerism. The sensitivity of a metameric match to any changes in the spectral elements that form the colors depend on the degree of metamerism. Two stimuli with a high degree of metamerism are likely to be very sensitive to any changes in the illuminant, material composition, observer, field of view, and so on.\nThe word \"metamerism\" is often used to indicate a metameric failure rather than a match, or used to describe a situation in which a metameric match is easily degraded by a slight change in conditions, such as a change in the illuminant.\nMeasuring metamerism.\nThe best-known measure of metamerism is the color rendering index (CRI), which is a linear function of the mean Euclidean distance between the test and reference spectral reflectance vectors in the CIE 1964 color space. CRI has been replaced with an updated metric, IES:TM30, that provides a more accurate assessment of fidelity and adds features for assessing how a test light will change the saturation and hue of colorants as compared to the reference light. Another metric, for daylight simulators, is the MI, the CIE metamerism index, which is derived by calculating the mean color difference of eight metamers (five in the visible spectrum and three in the ultraviolet range)&lt;templatestyles src=\"Citation/styles.css\"/&gt;[Why UV?] in CIELAB or CIELUV. The salient difference between CRI and MI is the color space used to calculate the color difference, the one used in CRI being obsolete and not perceptually uniform.\nMI can be decomposed into MIvis and MIUV if only part of the spectrum is being considered. The numerical result can be interpreted by rounding into one of five letter categories:\nMetamerism and industry.\nUsing materials that are metameric color matches rather than spectral color matches is a significant problem in industries where color matching or color tolerances are important. \nAutomobile industry.\nA classic example is the automobile industry: the colorants used for interior fabrics, plastics and paints may be chosen to provide a good color match under a cool white fluorescent source, but the matches can disappear under different light sources (e.g. daylight or tungsten source). Furthermore, because of the differences in colorants, spectral matches are infrequent and metamerism often occurs.\nTextile industry.\nColor matching in the textile dyeing industry is essential. In this branch, three types of metamerism are commonly encountered: illuminant metamerism, observer metamerism and field-size metamerism. Due to the wide range of different illuminants in modern life, textile color matching is difficult to ensure. Metamerism on large textile items can be resolved by using different light sources when comparing colors. However, metamerism in smaller items such as textile fibers, is more difficult to be solved. This difficulty arises due to the necessity of a microscope, which has one single illumination source, to observe these small fibers. Therefore, metameric fibres cannot be distinguished neither macroscopically nor microscopically. A method which can solve metamerism in fibres combines microscopy and spectroscopy, and is called microspectroscopy.\nPaint industry.\nColor matches made in the paint industry are often aimed at achieving a \"spectral color match\" rather than just a tristimulus (metameric) color match under a given spectrum of light. A spectral color match attempts to give two colors the same spectral reflectance characteristic, making them a good metameric match with a low degree of metamerism, and thereby reducing the sensitivity of the resulting color match to changes in illuminant, or differences between observers. One way to circumvent metamerism in paints is by using exactly the same pigment and base color compositions in the reproductions as the ones which were used in the original. When the composition of pigment and base color is unknown, metamerism can be avoided only with the use of colorimetric devices.\nPrinting industry.\nThe printing industry is also affected by metamerism. Inkjet printers do the mixing of colors under a specific light source, resulting in a modified appearance of original and copy under different light sources. One way to minimize metamerism in printing is by first measuring the spectral reflectance of an object or reproduction using a color measurement device. Then, one selects a set of ink compositions corresponding to the color reflectance factor, which are used by the inkjet printer for the reproduction. The process is repeated until original and reproduction present an acceptable degree of metamerism. Sometimes, however, one reaches the conclusion that an improved match is not possible with the materials available either due to gamut limitations or colorimetric properties.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Citation/styles.css\"/&gt;Why UV? Humans generally do not see the UV (ultraviolet) portion of the spectrum directly, but some materials will include optical brighteners which fluoresce. These absorb the normally invisible UV light and then re-emit that energy within the visible range, which in turn means that changing the illumination, even only within the UV range, can change the visual effect.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Cyrenaica includes all of the eastern part of Libya between the 16th and 25th meridians east, including the Kufra District. The coastal region, also known as \"Pentapolis\" (\"Five Cities\") in antiquity, was part of the Roman province of Crete and Cyrenaica, later divided into \"Libya Pentapolis\" and \"Libya Sicca\". During the Islamic period, the area came to be known as \"Barqa\", after the city of Barca.\nCyrenaica became an Italian colony in 1911. After the 1934 formation of Italian Libya, the Cyrenaica province was designated as one of the three primary provinces of the country. During World War II, it fell under British military and civil administration from 1943 until 1951, and finally in the Kingdom of Libya from 1951 until 1963. The region that used to be Cyrenaica officially until 1963 has formed several shabiyat, the administrative divisions of Libya, since 1995. The 2011 Libyan Civil War started in Cyrenaica, which came largely under the control of the National Transitional Council (headquartered in Benghazi) for most of the war. In 2012, a body known as the Cyrenaica Transitional Council unilaterally declared Cyrenaica to be an autonomous region of Libya.\nGeography.\nGeologically, Cyrenaica rests on a mass of Miocene limestone that tilts up steeply from the Mediterranean Sea and falls inland with a gradual descent to sea level again.\nThis mass is divided into two blocks. The Jebel Akhdar extends parallel to the coast from the Gulf of Sidra to the Gulf of Bomba and reaches an elevation of 882 meters. There is no continuous coastal plain, the longest strip running from the recess of Gulf of Sidra past Benghazi to Tolmeita. Thereafter, except for deltaic patches at Susa and Derna, the shore is all precipitous. A steep escarpment separates the coastal plain from a relatively level plateau, known as the Marj Plain, which lies at about 300 meters elevation. Above the Marj Plain lies a dissected plateau at about 700 meters elevation, which contains the highest peaks in the range.\nThe Jebel Akhdar and its adjacent coast are part of the Mediterranean woodlands and forests ecoregion and have a Mediterranean climate of hot, dry summers and relatively mild and rainy winters. The plant communities of this portion of Cyrenaica include forest, woodland, maquis, garrigue, steppe and oak savanna. Garrigue shrublands occupy the non-agricultural portions coastal plain and coastal escarpments, with \"Sarcopoterium spinosum\", along with \"Asphodelus ramosus\" and \"Artemisia herba-alba\", as the predominant species. Small areas of maquis are found on north-facing slopes near the sea, becoming more extensive on the lower plateau. \"Juniperus phoenicea, Pistacia lentiscus, Quercus coccifera\" and \"Ceratonia siliqua\" are common tree and large shrub species in the maquis. The upper plateau includes areas of garrigue, two maquis communities, one dominated by \"Pistacia lentiscus\" and the other a mixed maquis in which the endemic \"Arbutus pavarii\" is prominent, and forests of \"Cupressus sempervirens, Juniperus phoenicea, Olea europaea, Quercus coccifera, Ceratonia siliqua,\" and \"Pinus halepensis.\"\nAreas of red soil are found on the Marj Plain, which has borne abundant crops of wheat and barley from ancient times to the present day. Plenty of springs issue on the highlands. Wild olive trees are abundant, and large areas of oak savanna provide pasture to the flocks and herds of the local Bedouins. Historically large areas of range were covered in forest. The forested area of the Jebel Akhdar has been shrinking in recent decades. A 1996 report to the UN Food and Agriculture Organization estimated that the forested area was reduced to 320,000 hectares from 500,000 hectares, mostly cleared to grow crops. The Green Mountain Conservation and Development Authority estimates that the forested area decreased from 500,000 hectares in 1976 to 180,000 hectares in 2007.\nThe southward slopes of the Jebel Akhdar are occupied by the Mediterranean dry woodlands and steppe, a transitional ecoregion lying between the Mediterranean climate regions of North Africa and the hyper-arid Sahara.\nThe lower Jebel el-Akabah lies to the south and east of the Jebel Akhdar. The two highlands are separated by a depression. This eastern region, known in ancient times as Marmarica, is much drier than the Jebel Akhdar and here the Sahara extends to the coast. Historically, salt-collecting and sponge fishing were more important than agriculture. Bomba and Tobruk have good harbors.\nSouth of the coastal highlands of Cyrenaica is a large east\u2013west running depression, extending eastward from the Gulf of Sidra into Egypt. This region of the Sahara is known as the Libyan Desert, and includes the Great Sand Sea and the Calanshio Sand Sea. The Libyan Desert is home to a few oases, including Awjila and Jaghbub.\nHistory.\nBerber people.\nThe Ancient Libyans were the earliest recorded inhabitants of Cyrenaica.\nLate Bronze Age.\nEgyptian period.\nEgyptian records mention that during the New Kingdom of Egypt (thirteenth century BC), the Libu and Meshwesh tribes of Cyrenaica made frequent incursions into Egypt.\nIron Age.\nGreek colonization.\nCyrenaica was colonized by the Greeks beginning in the seventh century BC, when it was known as Kyrena\u00efka. The first and most important colony was that of Cyrene, established in about 631\u00a0BC by colonists from the Greek island of Thera, which they had abandoned because of a severe famine. Their commander, Aristoteles, took the Libyan name Battos. His descendants, known as the Battiadae, persisted despite severe conflict with Greeks in neighboring cities.\nThe eastern portion of the province, with no major population centers, was called Marmarica; the more important western portion was known as the Pentapolis, as it comprised five cities: Cyrene (near the modern village of Shahat) with its port of Apollonia (Marsa Susa), Arsinoe or Taucheira (Tocra), Euesperides or Berenice (near modern Benghazi), Balagrae (Bayda) and Barce (Marj)\u00a0\u2013 of which the chief was the eponymous Cyrene. The term \"Pentapolis\" continued to be used as a synonym for Cyrenaica. In the south, the Pentapolis faded into the Saharan tribal areas, including the pharaonic oracle of Ammonium.\nThe region produced barley, wheat, olive oil, wine, figs, apples, wool, sheep, cattle, and silphium, a herb that grew only in Cyrenaica and was regarded as a medicinal cure and aphrodisiac.\nCyrene became one of the greatest intellectual and artistic centers of the Greek world, famous for its medical school, learned academies and architecture, which included some of the finest examples of the Hellenistic style. The Cyrenaics, a school of thinkers who expounded a doctrine of moral cheerfulness that defined happiness as the sum of human pleasures, were founded by Aristippus of Cyrene. Other notable natives of Cyrene were the poet Callimachus and the mathematicians Theodorus and Eratosthenes.\nClassical Age.\nPersian period.\nIn 525\u00a0BC, after conquering Egypt, the Achaemenid (Persian) army of Cambyses II seized the Pentapolis, and established a satrapy (Achaemenid Persian province) over parts of the region for about the next two centuries.\nHellenistic period.\nThe Persians were followed by Alexander the Great in 332\u00a0BC, who received tribute from the cities after taking Egypt. The Pentapolis was formally annexed by Ptolemy I Soter, and through him passed to the diadoch dynasty of the Lagids, better known as the Ptolemaic dynasty. It briefly gained independence under Magas of Cyrene, stepson of Ptolemy I, but was reabsorbed into the Ptolemaic empire after his death. It was separated from the main kingdom by Ptolemy VIII and given to his son Ptolemy Apion, who, dying without heirs in 96\u00a0BC, bequeathed it to the Roman Republic.\nRoman period.\nThe Latin name \"Cyrenaica\" (or \"Kyrenika\") dates to the first century BC. Although some confusion exists as to the exact territory Rome inherited, by 78\u00a0BC it was organized as one administrative province together with Crete. It became a senatorial province in 20\u00a0BC, like its far more prominent western neighbor Africa proconsularis, and unlike Egypt itself, which became an imperial domain \"sui generis\" (under a special governor styled \"praefectus augustalis\") in 30\u00a0BC.\nDiocletian's Tetrarchy reforms of 293 altered Cyrenaica's administrative structure. It was split into two provinces: Libya Superior or Libya Pentapolis, comprising the above-mentioned Pentapolis, with Cyrene as its capital, and Libya Inferior or Libya Sicca, comprising Marmarica, with the important port city of Paraetonium as its capital. Each came under a governor holding the modest rank of \"praeses\". Both belonged to the Diocese of the Orient, with its capital at Antioch in Syria, and from 370, to the Diocese of Egypt, within the Praetorian prefecture of Oriens. Its western neighbor Tripolitania, the largest split-off from Africa proconsularis, became part of the Diocese of Africa, subordinate to the prefecture of \"Italia et Africa\". Following the Crete earthquake of 365, the capital was moved to Ptolemais. After the Empire's division, Cyrenaica became part of the East Roman Empire (Byzantine Empire), bordering Tripolitania. It was briefly part of the Vandal Kingdom to the west, until its reconquest by Belisarius in 533.\nThe Tabula Peutingeriana shows \"Pentapolites\" to the east of \"Syrtes Maiores\", indicating the cities of Bernice, Hadrianopolis, Taucheira, Ptolomaide, Callis, Cenopolis, Balacris and Cyrene.\nChristianization.\nAccording to the Synoptic Gospels, Simon of Cyrene carried the cross of Jesus Christ to the crucifixion.\nAccording to one tradition, Mark the Evangelist was born in the Pentapolis, and later returned after preaching with Paul the Apostle in Colosse (Col 4:10) and Rome (Phil 24; 2 Tim 4:11); from Pentapolis he made his way to Alexandria.\nAlexandrian Church\nEarly Christianity spread to Pentapolis from Egypt; Synesius of Cyrene (370\u2013414), bishop of Ptolemais, received his instruction at Alexandria in both the Catechetical School and the Mouseion, and he entertained a great deal of reverence and affection for Hypatia, the last pagan Neoplatonist, whose classes he had attended. Synesius was raised to the episcopate by Theophilus, patriarch of Alexandria, in 410. Since the First Council of Nicaea in 325, Cyrenaica had been recognized as an ecclesiastical province of the See of Alexandria, per the ruling of the Nicaean Fathers.The patriarch of the Coptic Church to this day includes the Pentapolis in his title as an area within his jurisdiction.\nThe Eparchy of the Western Pentapolis was part of the Coptic Orthodox Church, as the Pope of Alexandria was the Pope of Africa. The most senior position in The Holy Synod of the Coptic Orthodox Church after the Pope was the Metropolitan of Western Pentapolis, although, since its demise as a major Archiepiscopal Metropolis in the days of Pope John VI of Alexandria, it was held as a Titular See attached to another Diocese.\nAfter being repeatedly destroyed and restored during the Roman period Pentapolis became a mere borough, but was nevertheless the site of a diocese. Its bishop, Zopyrus, was present at the First Council of Nicaea in 325. The subscriptions at Ephesus (431) and Chalcedon (451) give the names of two other bishops, Zenobius and Theodorus.\nAlthough it retained the title \"Pentapolis\", the ecclesiastic province actually included all of the Cyrenaica, not just the five cities. Pentapolis is still included in the title of Popes of the Coptic Orthodox Church and the Greek Orthodox Church of Alexandria.\nMiddle Ages.\nArab and Ottoman rule.\nCyrenaica was conquered by Muslim Arabs under command of Amr ibn al-As during the tenure of the second caliph, Omar, in c.\u2009642, and became known as Barqah after its provincial capital, the ancient city of Barce. After the breakdown of the Ummayad caliphate it was essentially annexed to Egypt, although still under the same name, first under the Fatimid caliphs. The region became a base for piracy, and many of the pirates acted as privateers for the Fatimids. Around 1051/52, Jabbara, emir of Barqa, transferred his allegiance from the Fatimids to the Zirids.\nIn the middle of the 11th century, several Arab tribes, including the Bedouin Banu Hilal confederation devastated the North African coast under Zirid control. Barqa was ravaged by the Hilalian invasion and left to be settled by the Banu Sulaym while the Banu Hilal marched westwards. The invasion contributed to the decline of the port cities and maritime trade. Up to 200,000 Hilalian families migrated into Cyrenaica from Egypt. As a result of the migration by Arab tribes, Cyrenaica became more Arab than any place in the Arab world except for the interior of Arabia. The Ayyubid emir Qaraqush marched into the Maghreb and according to al-Maqrizi had taken control of Cyrenaica on orders of Saladin who wanted to use the province as an agricultural base. The Mamluks were seemingly unable to exert any significant control and had to ally with the resident Bedouins to accept their suzerainty indirectly while paying taxes. The Ottoman Empire later claimed suzerainty of Cyrenaica based on the Mamluk claim of suzerainty through alliance with the tribes. Cyrenaica was subsumed into Ottoman Libya.\nModern Age.\nIn 1879, Cyrenaica became a wilayah of the Ottoman Empire. In 1888, it became a under a \"mutasarrif\" and was further divided into five qadaas. The wali of Ottoman Tripolitania, however, looked after the military and judicial affairs. The bureaucratic setup was similar to the one in Tripoli. The mutasarrifate existed until the Italian invasion.\nItalian colonial rule.\nThe Italians occupied Cyrenaica during the Italo-Turkish War in 1911 and declared it an Italian protectorate on 15 October 1912. Three days later, the Ottoman Empire officially ceded the province to the Kingdom of Italy. On 17 May 1919, Cyrenaica was established as an Italian colony, and, on 25 October 1920, the Italian government recognized Sheikh Sidi Idriss as the leader of the Senussi, who was granted the princely rank of emir until 1929. In that year, Italy withdrew recognition of him and the Senussi. On 1 January 1934, Tripolitania, Cyrenaica, and Fezzan were united as the Italian colony of Libya.\nThe Italian fascists constructed the Marble Arch as a form of an imperial triumphal arch at the border between Cyrenaica and Tripolitani near the coast.\nThere was heavy fighting in Cyrenaica during World War II on the part of the Allies against the Italian Army and the Nazi German Afrika Korps. In late 1942, Allied forces liberated Cyrenaica from Axis occupation and the United Kingdom administered most of Libya through 1951, when the Kingdom of Libya was established and granted independence.\nEmirate of Cyrenaica.\nIn 1949, Idris al-Senussi, with British backing, proclaimed the independent Emirate of Cyrenaica. This emirate became part of the Kingdom of Libya when it was established, and an independent kingdom on 24 December 1951, with Idris al-Senussi becoming King Idris.\nGaddafi's regime.\nSince 1 September 1969, when the Senussi dynasty was overthrown by Colonel Muammar Gaddafi, Cyrenaica occasionally experienced nationalist activity against Gaddafi's military dictatorship, including a military rebellion at Tobruk in 1980.\nIn 2007, the Green Mountain Conservation and Development Authority, headed by Saif al-Islam Gaddafi, announced a regional plan for Cyrenaica, developed by the firm Foster and Partners. The plan, known as The Cyrene Declaration, aimed to revive Cyrenaica's agriculture, create a national park and develop the region as a cultural and eco-tourism destination. The announced pilot projects included plans for three hotels, including the Cyrene Grand Hotel near the ruins of Cyrene.\nLibyan civil war.\nFor much of the Libyan civil war, Cyrenaica was largely under the control of the National Transitional Council while Tripolitania and Fezzan remained under Gaddafi's government control. Some proposed a \"two-state solution\" to the conflict, with Cyrenaica becoming an independent state, but this concept was strongly rejected by both sides, and the three regions were united again in October 2011, as rebel forces took Tripolitania and Fezzan and the government collapsed.\nSince 2017, all of eastern Libya has been controlled by the Libyan National Army, led by Marshal Khalifa Haftar, who has governed the region as a military dictator.\nEpiscopal sees.\nAncient episcopal sees of the Roman province of Libya Superior or Libya Pentapolitana listed in the \"Annuario Pontificio\" as titular sees:\n\"For the ancient sees of Libya Inferior, see Marmarica.\"\"For those of Creta, see Byzantine Crete.\"\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It was the successor to Windows 98, and was released to manufacturing on June 19, 2000, and then to retail on September 14, 2000. It was Microsoft's main operating system for home users until the introduction of its successor Windows XP on October 25, 2001.\nWindows Me was targeted specifically at home PC users, and included Internet Explorer 5.5 (which could later be upgraded to Internet Explorer 6), Windows Media Player 7 (which could later be upgraded to Windows Media Player 9 Series), DirectX 7 (which could later be upgraded to DirectX 9) and the new Windows Movie Maker software, which provided basic video editing and was designed to be easy to use for consumers; it is the last MS-DOS-based Windows version as all consumer versions starting with Windows XP moved to the Windows NT kernel. Microsoft also incorporated features first introduced in Windows 2000, which had been released as a business-oriented operating system seven months earlier, into the graphical user interface, shell and Windows Explorer. Although Windows Me was still ultimately based around MS-DOS like its predecessors, access to real-mode DOS was restricted to decrease system boot time.\nWindows Me was initially positively received when it was released; however, it soon garnered a more infamous reputation from many users due to numerous stability problems. In October 2001, Windows XP was released to the public, having already been under development at the time of Windows Me's release, and incorporated most, but not all, of the features of Windows Me, while being far more stable.\nMainstream support for Windows Me ended on December 31, 2003, followed by extended support on July 11, 2006.\nDevelopment history.\nAt the 1998 Windows Hardware Engineering Conference, Microsoft CEO Bill Gates stated that Windows 98 would be the last iteration of Windows to use the Windows 9x kernel, with the intention for the next consumer-focused version to be based on the Windows NT kernel, unifying the two branches of Windows. However, it soon became apparent that the development work involved was too great to meet the aim of releasing before the end of 2000, particularly given the ongoing parallel work on the eventually-canceled Neptune project. The Consumer Windows development team was therefore re-tasked with improving Windows 98 while porting some of the look-and-feel from Windows 2000. Microsoft President Steve Ballmer publicly announced these changes at the next Windows HEIC in 1999.\nOn July 23, 1999, the first alpha version of Windows Me was released to testers. Known as Development Preview 1, it was very similar to Windows 98 SE, with the only major change being a very early iteration of the new Help and Support feature that would appear in the final version. Three more Development Previews were released over the subsequent two months.\nThe first beta version was released to testers and the industry press on September 24, 1999, with the second coming on November 24 that year. Beta 2 showed the first real changes from Windows 98, including importing much of the look-and-feel from Windows 2000, and the removal of real-mode DOS. Industry expert Paul Thurrott reviewed Beta 2 upon release and spoke positively of it in a review. By early 2000, Windows Me was reportedly behind schedule, and an interim build containing the new automatic update feature was released to allay concerns about a delayed-release.\nIn February 2000, Paul Thurrott revealed that Microsoft had planned to exclude Windows Me, as well as new releases of Windows NT 4.0, from CD shipments for MSDN subscribers. The reason given in the case of Me was that the OS was designed for consumers. However, Thurrott alleged that the real motivation behind both case was to force software developers to move to Windows 2000. Three days later, following a write-in and call-in campaign by hundreds of readers, Microsoft announced that Windows Me (including development versions) would ship to MSDN subscribers after all. Microsoft also apologized personally to Thurrott, claiming he received misinformation, though in a follow-up article he stated that it was \"clear that the decision [...] actually changed\".\nBeta 3 was released on April 11, 2000, and this version marked the first appearance of its final startup and shutdown sounds, which were derived from Windows 2000. Previous beta releases up until that point used the same startup and shutdown sounds from Windows 98.\nRelease.\nAlthough Microsoft signed off on the final build of Windows Me on June 28, 2000, after trialing three Release Candidate builds with testers, the final retail release was pushed back to September 14 for reasons that were not clear.\nShortly after Windows Me was released to manufacturing on June 19, 2000, Microsoft launched a marketing campaign to promote it in the U.S., which they dubbed the \"Meet Me Tour\". A national partnered promotional program featured the new OS, OEMs and other partners in an interactive multimedia attraction in 25 cities.\nWindows Me was released for retail sale on September 14, 2000. At launch time, Microsoft announced a time-limited promotion from September 2000 to January 2001 which entitled Windows 98 and Windows 98 SE users to upgrade to Windows Me for $59.95 instead of the regular retail upgrade price of $109. Non-upgrade versions cost $209, the same as Windows 98 on its release.\nJust over a year after Windows Me's release, Microsoft released its successor Windows XP on October 25, 2001, which included the ZIP folders and the Spider Solitaire game from Windows Me by default while also providing Internet Explorer 6, the updated version of Internet Explorer 5.5 from Windows Me, all while being based on the more stable and reliable Windows NT kernel, which on XP was an evolution of the one found in Windows 2000.\nNew and updated features.\nUser interface.\nWindows Me featured the shell enhancements inherited from Windows 2000 such as personalized menus, customizable Windows Explorer toolbars, auto-complete in Windows Explorer address bar and Run box, Windows 2000 advanced file type association features, displaying comments in shortcuts as tooltips, extensible columns in Details view (IColumnProvider interface), icon overlays, integrated search pane in Windows Explorer, sort by name function for menus, \"Places bar\" in common dialogs for \"Open\" and \"Save\", cascading Start menu special folders, some Plus! 95 and Plus! 98 themes, and updated graphics. The notification area in Windows Me and later supported 16-bit high color icons. The Multimedia control panel was also updated from Windows 98. \"Taskbar and Start Menu\" options allowed disabling of the drag and drop feature and could prevent moving or resizing the taskbar, which was easier for new users.\nRemoved features.\nReal mode DOS.\nWindows Me restricted support for real mode MS-DOS. As a result, codice_5 in Windows Me disregards codice_1, codice_13 and codice_14 and directly executes codice_15. In its default configuration the system would neither boot into an MS-DOS command prompt nor exit to DOS from Windows; real mode drivers such as codice_16 could not be loaded and older applications that require real mode could not be run. Microsoft argued that the change improved the speed and reliability of the boot process.\nIn Windows Me, the codice_1 and codice_2 files are used only to set global environment variables. The two files (if present) are scanned for settings relating to the environment variables, and any other commands present are moved into a Windows registry key (see below). The two files thus contain only settings and preferences which configure the \"global environment\" for the computer during the boot phase or when starting a new virtual DOS machine (VDM).\nTo specify or edit other startup values (which, in Windows 98, would be present in the codice_2 file) the user must edit the following Windows registry key:\ncodice_20\nFor troubleshooting and crash recovery, both the Windows Me CD-ROM and the Windows Me startup disk (a user-creatable floppy disk, known as the Emergency Boot Disk (EBD)) allowed booting into real mode MS-DOS.\nIt is possible to restore real mode DOS functionality through various unofficial means. Additionally, a registry setting exists that re-enables the \"Restart in MS-DOS mode\" option in the shutdown dialog box; however, unless patched unofficially with third-party software, Windows Me cannot be booted to MS-DOS real mode.\nOther components.\nUnlike previous versions of Windows 9x, Windows Me was entirely aimed at home users, and thus had certain enterprise-oriented features removed. Several features of its predecessors did not work or were officially unsupported by Microsoft on Windows Me, including Automated Installation, Active Directory client services, System Policy Editor, Personal Web Server and ASP. These features were supported on the previous versions of Windows 9x. A Resource Kit publication, targeted towards system administrators, was never published for Windows Me.\nOther features that were removed or never updated to work with Windows Me included Microsoft Fax, QuickView and DriveSpace, as well as the GUI FAT32 conversion tool. Several Windows Explorer commands were also modified in Windows Me, matching the menu structure in Windows 2000. While some were simply moved to a different location, certain functionality of the Go menu, as well as the Find command on the Tools menu, are no longer available. For the latter change Microsoft recommends using a variety of similar functionality labeled Search.\nThe Active Channels Channel bar from the original release of Windows 98 is not installed upon first boot like with Windows 98 Second Edition, however it is retained when upgrading from the original release of Windows 98 to Windows 98 Second Edition or Windows Me.\nWindows Me, like Windows 98 Second Edition, did not ship with the WinG API or RealPlayer 4.0, unlike the original release of Windows 98, due to both of these having been superseded by DirectX and Windows Media Player, respectively. On the other hand, ActiveMovie still exists in Windows Me despite having been superseded by Windows Media Player.\nUpgradeability.\nWindows Me could have its components upgraded or have new components installed up to the latest versions:\nSystem requirements.\nThe /nm setup switch can be used at the DOS command line to bypass the minimum system requirement checks, allowing for installation on a CPU as low as the 16\u00a0MHz 80486SX.\nLimitations.\nWindows Me is only designed to handle up to 512\u00a0MB of RAM without changes. Systems with larger RAM pools may lose stability; however, depending on the hardware and software configuration, it is sometimes possible to manually tweak the installation to continue working with somewhat larger amounts of RAM as well. The maximum amount of memory the operating system is designed to use is up to 1\u00a0GB of RAM. Systems with more than 1.5\u00a0GB of RAM may continuously reboot during startup.\nSupport lifecycle.\nCompared with other releases of Windows, Windows Me had a short shelf-life of just over a year. Windows 2000 and Windows Me were eventually succeeded by newer Microsoft operating systems: Windows Me by Windows XP Home Edition, and Windows 2000 Professional by Windows XP Professional. Windows XP is noteworthy that the first preview build of Windows XP (then codenamed \"Whistler\") was released to developers on July 13, 2000, two months before Windows Me's general availability date.\nMicrosoft originally planned to end support for Windows Me on December 31, 2004. However, in order to give customers more time to migrate to newer Windows versions, particularly in developing or emerging markets, Microsoft decided to extend support until July 11, 2006. Microsoft ended support for Windows Me (and Windows 98) on this date because the company considered the operating system to be obsolete and prone to security risks, and recommended customers to upgrade to a newer version of Windows such as Windows XP for the latest security improvements.\nRetail availability for Windows Me ended on December 31, 2003. The operating system is no longer available from Microsoft in any form (through MSDN or otherwise) due to the terms of Java-related settlements Microsoft made with Sun Microsystems.\nIn 2011, Microsoft retired the Windows Update v4 website. An independent project named Windows Update Restored aims to restore the Windows Update websites for older versions of Windows, including Windows Me.\nMicrosoft announced in July 2019 that the Microsoft Internet Games services on Windows Me (and XP) would end on July 31, 2019.\nReception.\nWindows Me initially received generally positive reviews, with reviewers citing the operating system's integrity protection (branded as \"PC Health\") and the new System Restore feature as steps forward for home users. Despite this, however, users' real-world experience did not bear this out, with industry publications receiving myriad reports of problems with the \"PC Health\" systems, PCs refusing to shut down cleanly, and general stability problems.\nAs time went on, reception of Windows Me became more negative, to the point where it was heavily panned by users, mainly due to stability issues. Retrospectively, Windows Me is viewed as one of the worst operating systems of all time, being unfavorably compared to its immediate predecessor and successor. A \"PC World\" article dubbed Windows Me the \"Mistake Edition\" and placed it 4th in their \"Worst Tech Products of All Time\" feature in 2006. The article states: \"Shortly after Me appeared in late 2000, users reported problems installing it, getting it to run, getting it to work with other hardware or software, and getting it to stop running.\" Consequently, most home users remained with Windows 98, while some moved to Windows 2000 despite the latter being enterprise-oriented. In the Netherlands, Windows Me was infamously known as \"Windows Meer Ellende\" (Dutch for \"more misery\").\nSystem Restore suffered from a bug in the date-stamping functionality that could cause System Restore to incorrectly date-stamp snapshots that were taken after September 8, 2001. This could prevent System Restore from locating these snapshots and cause the system restore process to fail. Microsoft released an update to fix this problem. \nByron Hinson and Julien Jay, writing for ActiveWin, took an appreciative look on the operating system. On the removal of real mode DOS support, they had noted \"The removal of DOS has clearly made a difference in Windows Me in terms of stability (far less Blue Screens of Death are seen now) and booting speed has greatly increased.\" In a recommendation of the operating system upgrade for users of Windows 95 and 98, they had stated \"If Windows Me isn't a revolutionary OS it's clear that Microsoft has focused its efforts to make it more user-friendly, stable and packed full of multimedia options. The result is great and the enhancements added are really worth the wait.\" The new features that Windows Me introduced were also praised and have since remained part of subsequent Windows versions.\nAlong with Windows 2000 from the Windows NT family, Windows Me was the last version of Windows that lacked product activation.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "75459", "revid": "7852030", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=75459", "title": "Numidia", "text": "Berber kingdom in North Africa from 202 BC to 46 AD\nNumidia () was the ancient kingdom of the Numidians in northwest Africa, initially comprising the northern part of what is now Algeria, but later expanding into modern Tunisia and Libya. The polity was originally divided between the Massylii state in the east (Capital: Cirta) and the Masaesyli state in the west (Capital: Siga). During the Second Punic War (218\u2013201 BC), Masinissa, king of the Massylii, defeated Syphax of the Masaesyli to unify Numidia into the first unified Berber state for Numidians in present-day Algeria. Initially a sovereign state and an ally of Rome, the kingdom later alternated between being a Roman province and a Roman client state.\nNumidia, at its foundation, was bordered by the Moulouya River to the west, Africa Proconsularis and Cyrenaica to the east. the Mediterranean Sea to the north, and the Sahara to the south so that Numidia entirely surrounded Carthage except towards the sea. before Masinissa expanded past the Moulouya and vassalizing Bokkar, and reaching the Atlantic ocean to the west.\nEtymology.\nThe Greek historians referred to these peoples as \"\u039d\u03bf\u03bc\u03ac\u03b4\u03b5\u03c2\" (i.e. Nomads), which by Latin interpretation became \"Numidae\" (but cf. also the correct use of \"Nomades\"). Historian Gabriel Camps, however, disputes this claim, favoring instead a local African origin for the term.\nDespite their presence, the Numidians are scarcely mentioned in Greek and Roman historical accounts until the First Punic War (264\u2013241 BC), when the Greek historian Polybius first noted their cavalry. He also indicated the peoples and territory west of Carthage including the entire north of Algeria as far as the river Mulucha (Muluya), about west of Oran.\nHistory.\nBackground.\nThe Numidians were people who inhabited North Africa, specifically the regions that now form northern Algeria and western Tunisia, during the final three centuries of the first millennium BC. Their lands bordered the Carthaginian hinterlands in eastern Tunisia to the east, the territory of the Mauri tribes to the west, and the Saharan edge occupied by the Gaetulians to the south. \nBy the time of the Second Punic War in 218 BC, the previously scattered Numidian tribes had consolidated into two great and rival tribal groups: the Massylii in eastern Numidia, and the Masaesyli in the west. During the first part of the Second Punic War, the eastern Massylii, under their king Gala, were allied with Carthage, while the western Masaesyli, under king Syphax, were allied with Rome. The Kingdom of Masaesyli under Syphax extended from the Moulouya river to Oued Rhumel. The Romans worked hard to cultivate Syphax's friendship, and helped to train his troops in the techniques of infantry warfare. \nSyphax initially revolted against Carthage, but Gala\u2019s son Masinissa, raised in Carthage, rallied forces and helped Carthage defeat Syphax twice by 213 BC, forcing him to flee. Masinissa then joined the Carthaginian general Hasdrubal Barca in Spain, where he played a key role in Carthaginian campaigns against Rome. After Gala\u2019s death, Carthage stripped Masinissa\u2019s family of their lands, prompting him to ally with Rome. Returning to Africa, he initially partnered with Syphax against Carthage. However, Hasdrubal married his daughter Sophonisba to Syphax, securing his loyalty to Carthage. Syphax defeated Masinissa twice in 205 BC, forcing him to retreat into the mountains, where he waged a guerrilla campaign, eluding capture and eventually joining forces with Scipio\u2019s Roman army.\nEstablishment.\nIn 204 BC, the Roman general Scipio Africanus landed in Africa with Roman forces, joined by Masinissa, whose tactical brilliance became evident when he helped destroy a combined Carthaginian-Numidian camp and later defeated Syphax and Hasdrubal at the Battle of Cirta in 203 BC. Masinissa captured Syphax and married Sophonisba, but Scipio, wary of her Carthaginian loyalty, demanded her surrender. To avoid enslavement, Sophonisba took poison, dying in 203 BC. In return, Scipio proclaimed Masinissa king of all Numidia.\nScipio Africanus honored Masinissa with a gold crown, a gold patera, a curule chair, an ivory sceptre, a toga picta, and a tunica palmata\u2014the traditional symbols of a Roman triumphator. Scipio declared that nothing was more magnificent among the Romans than these honors, implying that Masinissa was the only foreigner worthy of such distinction. These rewards recognized Masinissa\u2019s crucial role in securing Rome\u2019s victory in the war.\nMasinissa regained his father's kingdom, and also took control of much of Syphax's territory. The Second Punic War ended with a Roman victory at the battle of Zama in 202 BC, and Masinissa of the Massylii consolidated his position as the first king of a united Numidia with enthusiastic Roman patronage. The Romans were determined to keep a powerful ally in Africa to prevent the Carthaginians from threatening their hard-won hegemony in the western Mediterranean.\nHaving been educated in Carthage, Masinissa felt no hostility toward the Carthaginians. Several of his relatives bore Carthaginian names and his brother and uncle had family connections with Hannibal through marriage, and his grandson would later serve as a general there. However, to expand Numidia\u2019s wealth, he sought to enlarge its lands \u2014 and the only valuable ones available belonged to Carthage.\nMassinissa, constantly encroaching on the territory left to the Carthaginians, had, by 158 BC, conquered Lepcis Magna and the Tripolitanian coast, bringing under his authority all the Berber tribes established between Cyrenaica and the Ampsaga River. Masinissa's territory extended from the Mulucha river to the boundary of the Carthaginian territory, and also southeast as far as Cyrenaica to the gulf of Sirte, so that Numidia entirely surrounded Carthage (Appian, \"Punica\", 106) except towards the sea. Furthermore, after the capture of Syphax the king of the Masaesyli (West Algeria) with his capital based in Siga and after losing Siga had relocated to a temporary capital in Tinga, Bokkar, had become a vassal of Massinissa. Massinissa had also penetrated as far south beyond the Atlas to the Gaetuli and Fezzan was part of his domain.\nWar with Carthage.\nCarthage, complaining about Massinissa\u2019s encroachments as he had taken control of most of the emporia or African ports, thereby ruining its trade, appealed to Rome, which sent commissioners to investigate the grievances on-site. Among these envoys was Marcus Cato, who, upon observing the rapid recovery of Carthage, whose fleet and army had been rebuilt, advocated for the destruction of the Punic metropolis. He concluded all his reports and speeches with the words: \u201cMoreover, I think Carthage must be destroyed.\u201d\nAccording to Appian's sometimes unreliable account, three main factions dominated Carthage\u2019s internal politics in the mid-2nd century BC: a pro-Roman group supposedly led by Hanno III the Great, a pro-Numidian faction under a \u201cHannibal the Starling,\u201d and a \u201cdemocratic\u201d faction led by Hamilcar \u201cthe Samnite\u201d and Carthalo. In practice, the first two groups likely shared similar goals, since Rome and Numidia were closely aligned. The \u201cdemocrats,\u201d by contrast, appear to have favored wider political participation for ordinary citizens and opposed the entrenched aristocracy\u2014continuing the reformist tradition of Hannibal Barca\u2019s era.\nWhen Masinissa seized more Carthaginian territory in 152 BC, political tensions within the city intensified. The democratic, now nationalist, faction gained control and exiled around forty of their rivals, including the \u201cStarling.\u201d They even forced citizens to swear never to recall them. The exiles fled to Numidia, giving Masinissa the perfect excuse to intervene. After his son Gulussa was ambushed by Hamilcar\u2019s men, the elderly but still energetic king invaded Carthaginian lands in 151 BC with an army of 52,000 men, besieging a town called \u201cOroscopa.\u201d Hasdrubal, leading a force of 30,000 men to relieve the city, was decisively defeated by Gulussa, Massinissa\u2019s son, in 150 BC. By preparing to fight back, Carthage effectively broke the peace treaty of 201 BC\u2014an act that would soon trigger Rome\u2019s wrath and lead directly to the Third Punic War.\nLearning that Carthage had waged war against a prince allied with Rome, the Romans dispatched an army of 80,000 men to Africa. In 146 BC Carthage was obliterated by the armies of Consul Scipio Aemilianus after a 3 years long siege and 8 days of urban fighting in the city. The victors reduced Carthage\u2019s territory to a Roman province, which they named the \u201cProvince of Africa.\u201d\nNumidian Apogee.\nUnder Masinissa and his son Micipsa, Numidia flourished. During this era of stability, Numidia advanced significantly. Settled agriculture expanded alongside traditional pastoralism, towns grew more urbanized, and trade flourished through access to former Carthaginian ports. The kingdom maintained Roman favor by supplying grain and military auxiliaries, including cavalry, infantry, and elephants. The Numidian kings tried to involve themselves in the Greek-dominated Hellenistic culture of the eastern Mediterranean. In their coin portraits, Masinissa and Micipsa often wore a diadem, a white ribbon tied around the head and recognized as a Hellenistic symbol of monarchy. They financed the construction of Greek-style buildings in their cities, and one of Masinissa's sons even competed in the Panathenaic Games.\nPolitically, he engaged in the eastern Mediterranean, aiding Rome in the Macedonian Wars, sending troops to Greece, and supplying grain to Delos (which honored him). Dubious of his intentions in the aftermath of the Macedonian wars, Rome rejected his request to visit the Senate and make a sacrifice in the Capitol. Masinissa also maintained ties with Hellenistic monarchs such as Nicomedes II of Bithynia, while his sons received their education in Greece, probably Athens.\nMasinissa ruled for 55 years until his death in 148 BC, shortly before Rome\u2019s destruction of Carthage in 146 BC. Micipsa succeeded him, reigning for another 30 years. The three sons of Massinissa jointly ruled Numidia, under Roman oversight. At the request of Masinissa, Scipio Aemilianus arranged a division of Masinissa's kingdom and inheritance. Micipsa managed the palace and the treasury in Cira, Gulussa was given command of the Numidian army and Mastanabal was appointed chief Judicial authority in the kingdom. On the death of his two brothers in 145 BC, Micipsa, finding himself sole heir to the kingdom of Massinissa, reigned in Cirta, with the help of his two sons Adherbal and Hiempsal I, and his nephew Jugurtha, son of his brother Manastabal. An ambitious Jugurtha proved to be a capable warrior in the Roman siege of Numantia in 134 BC.\nWar with Rome.\nWhen Micipsa died in 118 BC, he was succeeded jointly by his two sons Hiempsal I and Adherbal and Jugurtha, who was very popular among the Numidians. Hiempsal and Jugurtha quarrelled immediately after the death of Micipsa. Jugurtha orchestrated the assassination of his cousin Hiempsal and expelled his other cousin, Adherbal, from Cirta. Adherbal fled to Rome to seek the Senate\u2019s protection. However, Jugurtha had already bribed influential Romans, prompting the Senate to divide Numidia in 114 BC: western Numidia was given to Jugurtha, while Adherbal retained the eastern portion. Jugurtha, having married the daughter of Bocchus, king of the western Mauri, amassed a large army and invaded Adherbal\u2019s territory in 112 BC. Adherbal retreated to Cirta, where he endured a two-year siege. Starving, he surrendered, but Jugurtha executed him along with many Italians living in the city. Summoned before the Senate for this act, Jugurtha escaped punishment by bribing senators. Before leaving Rome, he assassinated Massiva, the son of Gulussa, who had lodged complaints against him. As he departed, Jugurtha famously declared, \u201cO venal city, doomed to perish if it finds a buyer!\u201d \nDetermined to end Jugurtha\u2019s defiance, Rome sent the propraetor Aulus against him in 109 BC. However, Aulus was ambushed near Suthul and forced to pass under the yoke with his soldiers. Consul Metellus then took command, leading a victorious battle against Jugurtha\u2019s forces near Theveste. Jugurtha resorted to guerrilla warfare againt Metellus whose troops were constantly harassed across Numidia. Later, Metellus was compelled to retreat near Zama in 109 BC. \nIn 108 BC, after regrouping, Metellus invaded Numidia, pushing Jugurtha\u2019s Berber forces into retreat and capturing Cirta. Jugurtha fled to the Gaetulians and sought aid from Bocchus. Metellus was recalled and replaced by Consul Marius, who led an army of 50,000 men. Marius defeated the combined forces of Jugurtha and Bocchus near Sitifis after a three-day battle and returned to Cirta. Bocchus sought peace and, at the urging of Marius\u2019s lieutenant Sulla, betrayed Jugurtha. Luring his son-in-law into his camp, Bocchus handed Jugurtha over to the Romans in 106 BC. On January 1, 104 BC, Marius celebrated a triumph in Rome, with the captured Jugurtha paraded in chains. That same evening, Jugurtha was thrown into the Tullianum prison, where he soon died from cold and starvation.\nDivided kingdom.\nAfter the death of Jugurtha, western Numidia, which was now called Mauretania, was added to the lands of Bocchus I. Meanwhile, Gauda, another son of Manastabal who had remained loyal to Rome, was granted central Numidia. After Gauda\u2019s death shortly thereafter, his sons Hiempsal II and Hiarbas divided their father\u2019s kingdom, ruling under Roman supervision. These Numidian and Mauretanian kings, as Roman prot\u00e9g\u00e9s, frequently traveled to Rome, where their children were often educated and held as hostages to ensure their loyalty. Fluent in Latin and living according to Roman customs, they supported the arts, beautified their cities in Roman style, and developed their lands, which supplied Italy with a variety of agricultural products. Italians were also settled in fertile regions of Berber lands, often on lands confiscated from the indigenous population. This contributed to the increasing Romanization of North Africa. \nThe kings of Numidia and Mauretania often took advantage of Roman internal conflicts to settle their own disputes. During the civil war between Marius and Sulla, Marius, exiled by Sulla, sought refuge with Hiarbas, while Hiempsal II supported the dictator Sulla in 88 BC. Hiarbas, with the help of Marius\u2019s supporters, defeated his brother Hiempsal and seized his kingdom. To counter Hiarbas and the Marian faction he had revived in Africa, Sulla sent Gnaeus Pompey with six legions. Bocchus supported Pompey\u2019s forces with a large contingent of Mauretanian cavalry commanded by Gauda, the son of his son Bogud. Hiarbas, defeated by Pompey and besieged in Bulla Regia, was eventually forced to surrender to Gauda and was executed after enduring severe torture. Hiempsal II regained his kingdom and was granted Hiarbas\u2019s former territory in 81 BC. Around the same time, Bocchus died, and Mauretania was divided between his two sons: Bocchus II, who ruled the eastern part of the kingdom with the old Punic city of Iol as his capital, and Bogud, who inherited the western part with Tingi as its center.\nRoman civil war and the end of the Numidian Kingdom.\nJuba, succeeding his father Hiempsal II in 50 BC, sought to take advantage of the civil war between Caesar and Pompey to free himself from Roman control. From the city of Hippo, which he made his capital, he rallied exiles who helped him organize his native troops effectively. After Caesar took Italy from the Senate\u2019s faction, Attius Varus, a lieutenant of Pompey and leader of the senatorial army, proclaimed his general\u2019s authority in Africa and allied with Juba. Together, they defeated the army of Gaius Scribonius Curio, Caesar\u2019s lieutenant, at the Battle of the Bagradas in July 49 BC. Following Pompey\u2019s orders, Varus blocked African ports to halt shipments of goods, leading to famine in Italy, where even slaves began to starve. However, an agreement was reached between the rival leaders, who, realizing the need to avoid depopulating Italy, eventually neutralized the food embargo.\nIn the meanwhile, the Alexandrian war in Ptolemaic Egypt ended favorably for Caesar, who installed Cleopatra as queen of Egypt, and moved on to suppress a revolt in Armenia. The remnants of Pompey\u2019s forces, having regrouped in Africa under Varus, were joined by Labienus (a former lieutenant of Caesar), Metellus Scipio (Pompey\u2019s father-in-law), Afranius, Porcius Cato, and Gnaeus Pompey. With Juba\u2019s support and his Berber troops, the republican army held off Caesar, forcing him to launch a new campaign against them. \nFrom Rome, Caesar negotiated with Publius Sittius, a Campanian adventurer commanding a small army of Italians, Gauls, Spaniards, and Berbers in Africa. Promising Bocchus II and Bogud portions of Juba\u2019s territory if they supported him, Caesar landed near Hadrumetum in November 47 BC. Initially outnumbered, with only 5,000 soldiers against his opponents\u2019 60,000, Caesar failed to take Hadrumetum but gained the allegiance of Ruspina and Leptis Parva. Meanwhile, his quaestor Sallustius Crispus captured the Cercina Islands, a key supply base for Pompey\u2019s forces. Sittius captured Cirta, threatening Juba\u2019s rear and forcing him to divert forces to deal with the insurgent Gaetulians. Reinforced with 30,000 men at Ruspina, Caesar besieged Thapsus. On February 6, 46 BC, he decisively defeated the allied forces attempting to relieve the city. Juba, attempting to reach Zama-Regia, found its gates closed and was killed by a slave as Caesar entered the city in triumph. Scipio, cornered by Sittius\u2019s sailors in the Gulf of Hippo, stabbed himself and drowned.\nVictorious, Caesar sent Juba I\u2019s son to Rome, where he was educated in Roman culture and loyalty to its power. Caesar annexed eastern Numidia into the Roman province of Africa Nova, appointing his lieutenant Sallustius Crispus as governor. Sallust exploited the province, amassing wealth under the pretext of punishing it for supporting Pompey. Bocchus II was granted additional territory in Mauretania Sitifensis, while Bogud received western Numidia. Sittius, made legate, was awarded Cirta and its dependencies, taken from Masanasses, an ally of Juba. The surviving republican leaders fled to Spain, where Caesar, reinforced by Berber contingents under Bogud, defeated the Pompeian forces at Munda the following year. This marked the end of significant resistance to Caesar. Eastern Numidia was annexed in 46 BC to create a new Roman province, Africa Nova. Western Numidia was also annexed as part of the province Africa Nova after the death of its last king, Arabio, in 40 BC, and subsequently the province (except of western Numidia) was united with province Africa Vetus by Emperor Augustus in 25 BC, to create the new province Africa Proconsularis. During the brief period (30\u201325 BC) Juba II (son of Juba I) ruled as a client king of Numidia on the territory of former province Africa Nova.\nState organization.\nKing Massinissa, the first ruler of unified Numidia, sought to embody the full stature of a monarch\u2014almost in the likeness of a god. During his reign, the cult of the divine king emerged strongly; coins were struck with his image, temples were later dedicated to him, and he maintained both an army and a fleet, which even Rome relied on in the East.\nPolitical power.\nThe reign of Massinissa (203\u2013148 BC) marked the first true royal power in Numidia. Long and stable, it was secured by the sovereign\u2019s political skill, his ability to dominate his family, and to contain the autonomy of tribal chiefs, some of whom allied with Carthage. His authority rested on a confederal system bringing together tribes and communities, jealous of their prerogatives yet integrated into a broader whole. Certain nearby tribes, as well as a few towns, were directly subordinated to him, while the coastal cities, with their Punic heritage, retained a quasi-autonomy, and the Gaetuli remained largely outside his control. He also replaced the traditional tribal succession system with a law ensuring succession by the eldest son, modeled after Hellenistic monarchies. Massinissa had also promoted the idea that \"Africa should belong to Africans\", which resonated with his Berber subjects, naturally hostile to foreigners.\nMassinissa relied on matrimonial alliances and the use of tribal hostages. He also raised an army made up of tribal contingents, which he gradually organized into a more regular force following the Carthaginian model. This structure required solid finances and enabled the king to assert his authority. His power also rested on the unity of the Massylian people and the cohesion of tribes around his person, possibly reinforced by a semi-divine aura. Upon his death, the dynasty remained fragile: succession nominally fell to the eldest male heir, but was often contested by brothers and cousins, as shown by Jugurtha, who imposed himself through force and the elimination of rivals. Thus, although the Numidian kingdom was not a centralized modern state, neither was it merely a patchwork of independent tribes: it represented a genuine political construction, able to resist and negotiate with the great Mediterranean powers before its eventual absorption by Rome.\nArmed forces.\nNumidian cavalry.\nThe Numidian cavalry were renowned as the most effective light cavalry in the ancient Mediterranean, playing a crucial role in the armies of both Carthage and Rome. Despite their lack of armor, simple weaponry, and rudimentary tack, their unmatched horsemanship made them invaluable. Numidian riders, trained from childhood, mastered riding without saddles or bridles, using only a simple rein and wooden rod to guide their hardy, fast, and low-maintenance horses. Their close bond with their mounts enabled remarkable feats, such as switching to a spare horse mid-battle. Their distinctive tactics relied on speed and mobility. Using hit-and-run strategies, they would harass enemy formations with javelins while avoiding direct combat. This approach, developed from the raiding practices of North African nomads, minimized casualties while disrupting opponents. Notably, they excelled at reconnaissance, raiding, and supporting larger armies by keeping enemies off-balance. Numidian cavalry played pivotal roles in major conflicts, such as Hannibal\u2019s campaigns during the Second Punic War and Scipio Africanus\u2019 victory at Zama in 202 BC. After Rome\u2019s alliance with the Numidian king Masinissa, these horsemen became essential auxiliaries, fighting in wars across the Mediterranean. Even after Numidia\u2019s absorption into the Roman Empire, their tactics and equipment remained largely unchanged, with Numidian cavalry continuing to serve in policing and military campaigns well into the Roman imperial period.\nElephants.\nThe Numidian kings supplied African forest elephants (Loxodonta cyclotis) to the Romans, who used them in key battles such as Pydna (168 BC) and the siege of Numantia (134 BC). These elephants, smaller than bush elephants, were adopted from the Carthaginians, who used them effectively during the Punic Wars, including Hannibal\u2019s famous Alpine crossing. Initially, Carthaginian elephants carried only a mahout, as their size and ferocity were sufficient for combat. However, by the 1st century BC, Numidian elephants were equipped with turrets, as seen during Juba I\u2019s alliance with the Romans and Caesar\u2019s capture of 64 elephants at Thapsus (46 BC). Despite their utility, elephants could be unpredictable, as demonstrated during the siege of Numantia, where one enraged elephant caused chaos, trampling both allies and enemies.\nAgriculture.\nThe Numidian kingdom was very famous for its agricultural yield; besides lettuce, beans, and other grains already consumed by Berbers since the dawn of their recorded history, Numidia was very productive when it came to its famously high-quality wheat, very similar to the wheat farmed along the banks of the Egyptian Nile. According to Roman historian Pliny the elder:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Among the wheat imports of Rome, is light wheat imported from Gallia which does not surpass the weight of a bushel (Boisseau) 20 livres. The weight of the wheat of Sardinia surpasses that of Gallia by half a livre, the wheat of Biossia surpasses that of Gallia by an entire livre, whereas the wheat of Africa surpasses the weight of wheat of Gallia by a whole livre and three fourths.In 179 BC, King Masinissa of Numidia received a golden crown from the inhabitants of Delos, as he had offered them a shipload of grain. A statue of Masinissa was erected in Delos in his honor, with an inscription by a native from Rhodes. His sons, too, had statues erected on the island of Delos; the King of Bithynia, Nicomedes, had also dedicated a statue to Masinissa. By 143 AD, the export of olive oil from Numidia rivaled its grain export throughout the Roman Empire.\nIn 200 BC, the Roman Army stationed in Macedonia received 17,508 hectoliters of Numidian wheat; in 198 BC, the Roman Army in Greece was sent, once again, the same amount of wheat. In 191 BC, Rome received 26,262 hectoliters of wheat and 21,885 hectoliters of barley; Greece, the same year, received 43,770 hectoliters of wheat and 26,262 hectoliters of barley. Then, in 171 BC, the Roman army in Macedonia received 87,540 hectoliters of wheat.\nIn total Rome received:\nThese numbers only represent a fraction from the reserves of the kingdom of Massinissa. His contributions to the Romans in 170 BC appear to be only a fraction of the kingdom's total production, as he was upset by Rome's decision to pay for the provided wheat that year. Massinissa hadn't laid his hands yet on the fertile lands of the Emporia (North West Ancient Libya) nor the great plains full of fertile soil yet; generally, barley was his kingdom's main produce, as they grew barley in light, mountainous and hilly soil which is suitable for its cultivation.\nCulture.\nNumidian culture developed at the crossroads of indigenous Berber traditions and Punic influences brought by Carthage, especially through military ties, intermarriage, and education at Carthage. Even after Carthage\u2019s political decline in 201 BC, Punic influence continued. Numidian towns adopted Phoenician-style institutions, such as magistrates called \"sufetes\".\nFar from being passive receivers of a ready-made civilization, the Numidians actively participated in shaping what became a distinctive North African culture. The Numidian capital city of Cirta embodied a Punic-Numidian cultural fusion enriched by Greek influence. This was illustrated by the votive stelae dedicated to the Punic gods Baal Hammon and Tanit, discovered in the Constantinian suburb of El-Hofra and dated to the 3rd\u20132nd centuries BC.\nLanguage.\nLanguage played a central role in the aforementioned cultural fusion. The official language of the Numidian and Mauretanian kingdoms was Punic, used for royal inscriptions, coin legends, and religious dedications. Numidia even developed into a center of Punic literature, with King Hiempsal II writing history in Punic after 146 BC, when the Romans had presented Massinissa\u2019s heirs with Carthage\u2019s library. Even centuries after the fall of Carthage, Punic remained alive; Saint Augustine testified that farmers around Hippo still spoke it in his time. \nAlongside Punic, the Libyco-Berber script was also in use, an alphabet that survives among the Tuareg as Tifinagh, a name probably meaning \u201cthe Punic letters.\u201d Only at Dougga did the Numidian kings attempt to use Libyco-Berber in official inscriptions, showing the coexistence of both linguistic traditions.\nAccording to the French historian Gilber Meynier, both a Greek and later an Italian colony, likely Punicized, lived at Cirta. The stelae bear inscriptions in Punic and Greek, reflecting the city\u2019s multicultural character. The Numidian kings and elites were well-versed in Greek, which was then the international language of diplomacy and refined culture across the Mediterranean, including in Rome. When Scipio Aemilianus captured Carthage in 146 BC, he conversed in Greek with King Massinissa, and the latter\u2019s descendants also spoke Greek. By the 1st century BC, Numidia had its own diplomatic and cultural ties with the Greek world. \nReligion.\nReligion in Numidia also demonstrates the merging of traditions. The great Punic gods, Baal Hammon and Tanit, were worshiped across the Numidian kingdoms. Baal Hammon was so deeply rooted in North Africa that he later became identified with the Roman Saturn, while Tanit (or Tinit) had a name resonating with Berber phonetics. Massinissa, influenced by Phoenician civilization, allowed the worship of Phoenician gods in urban centers, while rural communities venerated local gods and spirits. Some Libyan groups also worshipped celestial bodies such as the Sun and Moon. Massinissa, despite his openness to foreign influences, had a profound influence on religion in his kingdom. He did not abandon traditional African beliefs. When he welcomed Roman consul Publius Cornelius Scipio, he expressed his gratitude in a distinctly African manner, saying: \u201cI give thanks to you, O Great Sun, and to you, other gods of the heavens.\u201d This invocation highlights his reverence for the solar deity. As an admirer of Greek culture, he likely introduced the Numidians to the Greek cult of Demeter and Persephone (Ceres), a fertility religion involving rituals aimed at promoting agricultural productivity. These rites often included crude and provocative elements, reflecting their connection to natural cycles and fertility.\nArchitecture.\nThe term \u201cRoyal Numidian Architecture\u201d was coined for the monuments that were constructed by the Numidian kings. These monuments consist of tombs, tumuli and sanctuaries. Some examples of these structures are the mausoleum of Thugga, the tomb of Beni Rhenane, a tomb at Henchur Burgu in Djerba as well as two tumulus tombs known as the Madghacen and the Royal Mausoleum of Mauretania. There are also altars that were built at Simitthus and Kbor Klib. All of these monuments were built within the area ruled by Massinissa and his descendants.\nNumidian urban life reflected this same cultural blend. Historian Gabirel Camps stresses that cities such as Cirta, Siga, and Volubilis were not Carthaginian colonies, but authentic centers of Punic culture. They displayed Punic urban planning, sanctuaries, and inscriptions while retaining Berber characteristics. Architecture provides striking examples of this synthesis. The Medracen mausoleum, built in the 4th or 3rd century BC, is a vast royal tomb that combines the Berber form of the stepped tumulus with Punic and Hellenistic features such as Doric columns, Egyptian-style cornices, and cedar ceilings. Other mausolea at Dougga, Maktar, and Khroub illustrate the same mixture. These monuments show that Numidian elites were already deeply Punicized well before Carthage\u2019s destruction, while still maintaining indigenous forms.\nMassinissa was likely the first Numidian ruler to Hellenize his court, turning it into a cultural center visited by figures like Polybios and Ptolemy VIII. His coinage displayed Greek artistic traits (a diademed bust, the elephant symbol of Numidian royalty). He may have pioneered the use of Numidian marble and adopted Hellenistic-style architecture, including monumental tombs.\nTrade.\nThe significance of trade in the Numidian kingdom is evident from the development of coinage. Many coins depict a bearded figure on one side and a free, galloping or rearing horse on the other. Some coins bear the inscriptions \u201cMN,\u201d an abbreviation for Massinissa (MSNSN), or \u201cMKWSN\u201d (Micipsa). While coin minting in Numidia predates Massinissa, it expanded significantly during his reign. This increase in coin circulation is attributed to Massinissa, particularly as the largest number of coins has been discovered around Constantine. These coins, made of lead or bronze, were used for domestic trade. Trade also involved rural populations paying taxes in grain. For foreign commerce, Massinissa received gold and silver coins from other nations in exchange for Numidian exports such as grain, ivory, ostrich feathers and eggs, exotic animals for circuses, and wood. \nThe Numidian kingdom maintained trade relations with the Iberian Peninsula, Carthage, and Rome, as well as the Greek world, including Rhodes, Athens, and Delos. Grain was the primary export. Historian Camps, referencing Livy, provides detailed records of Numidian grain exports to Rome: 14,000 quintals of wheat and 10,500 quintals of barley in 200 BC, 14,000 quintals of wheat in 198 BC, 56,000 quintals of wheat and 28,000 quintals of barley in 191 BC, and 70,000 quintals of wheat in 170 BC. \nMassinissa used to provide to the population of Rhodes Toja wood and Ivory, in Cirta multiple Rhodian amphorae from the 2nd century B.C were found in burial sites and one of them carries the inscription (Sodamos). Massinissa encouraged Greek merchants to settle in his cities and welcomed figures like the historian Polybius. During his reign, North Africa established direct trade connections with both the East and the West, bypassing Carthage. This transformation was largely due to Massinissa\u2019s efforts.\nNumidia took over most of the famous Carthaginian ports which were one of the most important in the mediterranean, the famous Roman orator and historian Cicero tells us that the Numidian king had a war navy to protect his trade, in one story, the fleet of Massinissa sailed to Malta and confiscated large ivory elephant pillars from the temple of Juno and returned to Numidia and gave it as a prize to Massinissa. When the king knew about the origin of the gift, he prepared a nimble fleet of five ships and sent it back to where it came from. This funny story tells us that not only Massinissa had enough ships to perform tasks at will but also these fleets were functioning outside of African shorelines towards the central Mediterranean.\nMajor cities.\nNumidia became highly romanized and was studded with numerous towns. The chief towns of Roman Numidia were, in the north, Cirta or modern Constantine, the capital, with its port Russicada (modern Skikda); and Hippo Regius (near B\u00f4ne), well known as the see of St. Augustine. To the south in the interior military roads led to Theveste (Tebessa) and Lambaesis (Lambessa) with extensive Roman remains, connected by military roads with Cirta and Hippo, respectively.\nLambaesis was the seat of the Legio III \"Augusta\", and the most important strategic centre. It commanded the passes of the Aur\u00e8s Mountains (Mons Aurasius), a mountain block that separated Numidia from the Gaetuli Berber tribes of the desert, and which was gradually occupied in its whole extent by the Romans under the Empire. Including these towns, there were altogether twenty that are known to have received at one time or another the title and status of Roman colonies; and in the 5th century, the \"Notitia Dignitatum\" enumerates no fewer than 123 sees whose bishops assembled at Carthage in 479.\nEpiscopal sees.\nSee Numidia (Roman province)#Episcopal sees.\nExplanatory notes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "75462", "revid": "50785151", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=75462", "title": "Cilicia", "text": "Geographical region in Turkey\nCilicia ( ) is a geographical region of southern Anatolia in West Asia, extending inland from the northeastern coasts of the Mediterranean Sea. Cilicia borders Pamphylia to the west, Lycaonia and Cappadocia to the north, Commagene to the north-east, Syria to the east and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. Cilicia has a population ranging over six million, concentrated mostly at the Cilician plain (). The region includes the provinces of Mersin, Adana, Osmaniye and Hatay.\nName.\nThe name of Cilicia () was derived from the Akkadian toponym (), which was the name used by the Neo-Assyrian Empire to designate the western part of what would become Cilicia.\nThe English spelling is the same as the Latin, as it was transliterated directly from the Greek form . The palatalization of c occurring in Western Europe in later Vulgar Latin (c.\u2009500\u2013700) accounts for its modern pronunciation in English.\nGeography.\nCilicia is located on the southern coast of Anatolia, and it historically extended from Coracesium or the river Melas in the west to the Amanis mountains in the east, while to the north it was bounded by the Taurus Mountains, which are passable in very few places, such as the Cilician Gates.\nCilicia consisted of two main contrasting regions:\nThe western mountainous part of Cilicia was called Rugged Cilicia or Rough Cilicia (; ), while the eastern region was dominated by the alluvial plain of the rivers Cydnus, Sarus, and Pyramus, and was therefore known as Plain Cilicia or Flat Cilicia (; ).\nSalamis, the city on the east coast of Cyprus, was included in the Roman province of Cilicia from 58 BC until 27 BC.\nRough Cilicia.\nRough Cilicia (; ; ; ) is a rugged mountain district formed by the spurs of Taurus, which often terminate in rocky headlands with small sheltered harbours, features which, in classical times, made the coast a string of havens for pirates and, in the Middle Ages, outposts for Genoese and Venetian traders. The district is watered by the Calycadnus and was covered in ancient times by forests that supplied timber to Phoenicia and Egypt. Cilicia lacked large cities.\nPlain Cilicia.\nPlain Cilicia (; ; ; ), to the east, included the rugged spurs of Taurus and a large coastal plain, with rich loamy soil, known to Greeks such as Xenophon (who passed through with his mercenary group of the Ten Thousand,) for its abundance (\"euthemia\"), filled with sesame and millet and olives and pasturage for the horses imported into ancient Israel by King Solomon. Many of its high places were fortified.\nThe plain is watered by the three great rivers, the Cydnus (Tarsus \u00c7ay Berdan River), the Sarus (Seyhan), and the Pyramus (Ceyhan River), each of which brings down much silt from the deforested interior and which fed extensive wetlands. The Sarus now enters the sea almost due south of Tarsus, but there are clear indications that at one period it joined the Pyramus, and that the united rivers ran to the sea west of Kara-tash. Through the rich plain of Issus ran the great highway that linked east and west, on which stood the cities of Tarsus (Tarsa) on the Cydnus, Adana (Adaniya) on the Sarus, and Mopsuestia (Missis) on the Pyramus.\nClimate.\nThe climate of Cilicia shows significant differences between the mountains and the lower plains. At the lower plains, the climate reflects a typical Mediterranean style; summers are hot while winters are mild, making the land, particularly, the eastern plains, fertile. In the coldest month (January), the average temperature is 9\u00a0\u00b0C, and in the warmest month (August), the average temperature is 28\u00a0\u00b0C. The mountains of Cilicia have an inland climate with snowy winters. The average annual precipitation in the region is 647\u00a0mm and the average number of rainy days in a year is 76. Mersin and surrounding areas have the highest average temperature in Cilicia. Mersin also has high annual precipitation (1096\u00a0mm) and 85 rainy days in a year.\nGeology.\nThe mountains of Cilicia are formed from ancient limestones, conglomerate, marlstone, and similar materials. The Taurus Mountains are composed of karstic limestone, while its soil is also limestone-derived, with pockets of volcanic soil. The lower plain is the largest alluvial plain in Turkey. Expansion of limestone formations and fourth-era alluvials brought by the rivers Seyhan and Ceyhan formed the plains of the region over the course of time.\nAkyatan, Akyayan, Salt Lake, Seven lakes at Alada\u011f, and Karstik Dipsiz lake near Karaisal\u0131 are the lakes of the region. The reservoirs in the region are Seyhan, \u00c7atalan, Yedig\u00f6ze, Kozan and Mehmetli.\nThe major rivers in Cilicia are Seyhan, Ceyhan, Berdan (Tarsus), Asi and G\u00f6ksu.\nHistory.\nNeolithic.\nCilicia was settled from the Neolithic period onwards. Dating of the ancient settlements of the region from Neolithic to Bronze Age is as follows: Aceramic/Neolithic: 8th and 7th millennia BC; Early Chalcolithic: 5800 BC; Middle Chalcolithic (correlated with Halaf and Ubaid developments in the east): c.\u00a05400\u20134500 BC; Late Chalcolithic: 4500 \u2013 c.\u00a03400 BC; and Early Bronze Age IA: 3400\u20133000 BC; EBA IB: 3000\u20132700 BC; EBA II: 2700\u20132400 BC; EBA III A-B: 2400\u20132000 BC.\nBronze Age.\nDuring the Bronze Age, the region which would become Cilicia was known as Kizzuwatna, and silver from this region was exported to Middle Kingdom Egypt.\nThere exists evidence that circa 1650 BC both Hittite kings Hattusili I and Mursili I enjoyed the freedom of movement along the Pyramus River (now the Ceyhan River in southern Turkey), proving they exerted strong control over Cilicia in their battles with Syria. After the death of Murshili around 1595 BC, Hurrians wrested control from the Hittites, and Cilicia was free for two centuries. The first king of free Cilicia, I\u0161putah\u0161u, son of Pariyawatri, was recorded as a \"great king\" in both cuneiform and Hittite hieroglyphs. Another record of Hittite origins, a treaty between I\u0161putah\u0161u and Telipinu, king of the Hittites, is recorded in both Hittite and Akkadian.\nIn the next century, the Cilician king Pilliya finalized treaties with both King Zidanta II of the Hittites and Idrimi of Alalakh, in which Idrimi mentions that he had assaulted several military targets throughout Eastern Cilicia. Niqmepa, who succeeded Idrimi as king of Alalakh, went so far as to ask for help from a Hurrian rival, Shaushtatar of Mitanni, to try and reduce Cilicia's power in the region. It was soon apparent, however, that increased Hittite power would soon prove Niqmepa's efforts to be futile, as the city of Kizzuwatna soon fell to the Hittites, threatening all of Cilicia. Soon after, King Sunassura was forced to accept vassalization under the Hittites, becoming the last king of ancient Cilicia. After the death of Mursili I, which led to a power struggle among rival claimants to the throne, eventually leading to the collapse of Hittite supremacy, Cilicia appeared to have regained its independence.\nIn the 13th century BC a major population shift occurred as the Sea Peoples overran Cilicia. The Hurrians that resided there deserted the area and moved northeast towards the Taurus Mountains, where they settled in the area of Cappadocia.\nIron Age.\nDuring the late Iron Age, several local states emerged in Cilicia, which therefore became dominated by two main polities:\nDuring the 1st millennium BC, silver from Cilicia was exported to Assyria.\nDuring the 8th to 7th centuries BC, Greek traders and colonists established settlements on the Cilician coasts, such as Nagidos and Celenderis founded by Samos, Soli founded by Lindos; Greeks also established themselves in local settlements, such as at Anchiale and Tarsus.\nKingdom of Cilicia.\nFollowing the collapse of the Neo-Assyrian Empire, an independent state, called Cilicia () by the ancient Greeks, was established in southeastern Anatolia in the 6th century BC under the rule of a native dynasty, with its capital at the city of Tarsus.\nSubmission to the Achaemenid Empire.\nIn the mid-6th century BC, the kingdom of Cilicia supported the founding king of the Persian Achaemenid Empire, Cyrus II, in his wars against Croesus of Lydia, as a consequence of which Cilicia became a vassal of the Achaemenid empire as from c.\u2009542 BC, and the Cilician rulers became part of the Achaemenid administration.\nUnder early Achaemenid rule, Cilicia maintained a significant degree of autonomy and the native rulers at Tarsus acted as satraps (governors) for the Achaemenid administration, with their authority extending until as far west as Aspendus.\nCilicia remained under efficient administration, and it would continue to provide troops for the Achaemenid wars in Anatolia, Egypt and Cyprus.\nSatrapy of Cilicia.\nIn 401 BC, the Achaemenid king of kings Artaxerxes II abolished the autonomy of Cilicia in reaction to the local Cilician ruler Syennesis III's support for the rebellion of Cyrus the Younger, resulting in the kingdom of Cilicia being abolished and fully integrated into the Achaemenid empire as a normal province ruled by and appointed by the Achaemenid king of kings, which it would remain until the end of the Achaemenid Empire in 333 BC.\nOnce the revolt of Cyrus the Younger had been suppressed, Cilicia was again used as an assembly point for Achaemenid forces in preparation for military action in the Aegean Sea during 396 to 395 BC, and against Cyprus in the 380s BC.\nDuring the 390s BC, Camisares was appointed as satrap of Cilicia. Camisares was himself succeeded by his son, Datames, who eventually became the satrap of both Cilicia and Cappadocia until his assassination in c.\u2009362 BC.\nIn the 340s BC, the satrap of Cilicia was Mazaeus, who was also given authority over Syria as reward for his service in a campaign against Egypt.\nHellenistic period.\nFollowing the Battle of Issus, Cilicia became part of the empire of Alexander III of Macedon.\nAlexander forded the Halys River in the summer of 333 BC, ending up on the border of southeastern Phrygia and Cilicia. He knew well the writings of Xenophon, and how the Cilician Gates had been \"impassable if obstructed by the enemy\". Alexander reasoned that by force alone he could frighten the defenders and break through, and he gathered his men to do so. In the cover of night, they attacked, startling the guards and sending them and their satrap into full flight, setting their crops aflame as they made for Tarsus. This good fortune allowed Alexander and his army to pass unharmed through the Gates and into Cilicia.\nDuring Alexander III's invasion, a lesser officer named Arsames who had fled to Cilicia from the northwest to organise new resistance there defended it against the Macedonian forces.\nAfter Alexander's death it was long a battleground of the rival Hellenistic monarchs and kingdoms, and for a time fell under Ptolemaic dominion (i.e., Egypt), but finally came to the Seleucids, who, however, never held effectually more than the eastern half.\nDuring the Hellenistic period, the Teucrid dynasty ruled at the city of Olba.\nAlthough no later Persian empire ever regained control of Cilicia, one Seleucid officer named Aribazus and attested as administrator of Cilicia in 246 BC was possibly of Persian descent.\nDuring the Hellenistic era, numerous cities were established in Cilicia, which minted coins showing the badges (gods, animals, and objects) associated with each polis.\nThe Seleucids, especially Antiochus IV, focused on Hellenising Cilicia by establishing or rebuilding several poleis, such as Seleucia on the Calycadnus, Antioch on the Cydnus (Tarsus), Seleucia on the Pyramus (Mopsuestia), Hierapolis (Castabala), and Epiphaneia.\nIn the 3rd century BC, sporadic Ptolemaic presence was attested in Rugged Cilicia.\nWith the weakening of the Seleucid kingdom in the late 2nd century BC, piracy spread in Cilicia.\nRoman and Byzantine periods.\nIn 102 BC, the Roman Republic establiched a of the Marcus Antonius in Cilicia to fight the Cilician pirates, with the command being renewed repeatedly.\nIn 83 BC, the Armenian king Tigranes II conquered Plain Cilicia, and he deported Cilicians to Tigranocerta.\nBetween 78 and 74 BC, Publius Servilius Vatia Isauricus conquered the population of Rugged Cilicia, which made a permanent Roman presence in Cilocia possible.\nIn 69 BC, Lucullus returned the Cilician deportees to Tigranocerta back to their homeland.\nAfter Pompey was given the , he was able to defeat the Cilician pirates in 67 BC, and he arranged for his defeated enemies to be settled in Pompeiopolis (formerly Soli) and other depopulated Cilician towns. This victory strengthened the Roman presence in Cilicia.\nCilicia Trachea became the haunt of pirates, who were subdued by Pompey in 67 BC following a Battle of Korakesion (modern Alanya), and Tarsus was made the capital of the Roman province of Cilicia. Cilicia Pedias became Roman territory in 103 BC first conquered by Marcus Antonius Orator in his campaign against pirates, with Sulla acting as its first governor, foiling an invasion of Mithridates, and the whole was organized by Pompey, 64 BC, into a province which, for a short time, extended to and included part of Phrygia.\nIn 51 BC, the Parthian Empire was able to take advantage of the weakness of the Roman Republic to invade Cilicia ().\nIn 51 or 50 BC, the Cicero successfully campaigned in Cilicia against the Eleutherokilikes in the Amanus Mountains, which further solidified the Roman presence in CIlicia.\nIt was reorganized by Julius Caesar, 47 BC, and about 27 BC became part of the province Syria-Cilicia Phoenice. At first, the western district was left independent under native kings or priest-dynasts, and a small kingdom, under Tarcondimotus I, was left in the east; but these were finally united to the province by Vespasian, AD 72.Containing 47 known cities, it had been deemed important enough to be governed by a proconsul.\nAfter Julius Caesar's death, the of Cilicia was dissolved in 43 BC, and most of Rugged Cilicia was given to Amyntas of Galatia, then to Archelaus of Cappadocia. Plain Cilicia meanwhile was ruled by the kingdom of Tarcondimotus I as well as other smaller client-states of the Roman Republic or administered as part of Syria.\nTarcondimotus I had supported the losing side of both Roman civil wars by offering naval support to Pompey and Mark Antony, due to which his son Tarcondimotus II Philopator was deposed in 30 BC, although he was restored to power between 20 BC and 17 AD.\nParts of Cilicia were given to Antiochus IV of Commagene by Caligula, who incorporated the rest of it into Syria.\nA province of Cilicia with Tarsus as capital was re-established in 72 AD by Vespasian.\nIn 194 AD, Septimius Severus defeated Pescennius Niger at the Cilician Gates. Under the Severan dynasty, during the late 2nd to early 3rd centuries AD, the city of Anazarbus, which was made into a metropolis, became a rival of Tarsus.\nIn 259 or 260, the Persian Sasanian king of kings Shapur I defeated the Roman Emperor Valerian, whose army included Cilician soldiers. After Valerian's defeat, the Sasanian forces burnt and sacked several cities in Syria, Cilicia () and Cappadocia, and devastated large parts of Cilicia.\nUnder Emperor Diocletian's Tetrarchy (c.\u00a0297), Cilicia was governed by a \"consularis\"; with Isauria and the Syrian, Mesopotamian, Egyptian and Libyan provinces, formed the Diocesis Orientis (in the late 4th century the African component was split off as Diocese of Egypt), part of the pretorian prefecture also called \"Oriens\" ('the East', also including the dioceses of Asiana and Pontica, both in Anatolia, and Thraciae in the Balkans), the rich bulk of the eastern Roman Empire. After the division of the Roman Empire, Cilicia became part of the eastern Roman Empire, the Byzantine Empire. Cilicia was one of the most important regions of the classical world and can be considered as the birthplace of Christianity.\nDiocletian made Rugged Cilicia into a province named Isauria, with its capital at Seleucia.\nRoman Cilicia exported the goats-hair cloth, \"Cilicium\", which was used to make tents. Tarsus was also the birthplace of the early Christian missionary and author St. Paul, likely writer of 13 of the 27 books included in the New Testament.\nCilicia had numerous Christian communities and is mentioned six times in the Book of Acts and once in the Epistle to the Galatians (1:21). After Christianity became the official religion of the Roman Empire in the 4th century, Cilicia was included in the territories of the patriarchate of Antioch. The region was divided into two civil and ecclesiastical provinces: \"Cilicia Prima\", with a metropolitan diocese at Tarsus and suffragan dioceses for Pompeiopolis, Sebaste, Augusta, Corycus, Adana, Mallus and Zephyrium; and \"Cilicia Secunda\", with a metropolitan diocese at Anazarbus and suffragan dioceses for Mopsuestia, Aegae, Epiphania, Irenopolis, Flavias, Castabala, Alexandria, Citidiopolis and Rhosus. Bishops from the various dioceses of Cilicia were well represented at the First Council of Nicaea in 325 and at the later ecumenical councils.\nIn 400, Theodosius I divided Plain Cilicia into the provinces of Cilicia Prima, headquartered at Tarsus, and Cilicia Secunda, whose capital was Anazarbus.\nThe Christian Church in Cilicia was under the authority of the Patriarch of Antioch.\nCilicia remained prosperous, due to which several, largely ecclesiastical, construction works were undertaken there.\nFrom the middle of the 7th century, Cilicia became more and more close to the border between the Byzantine Empire and the Caliphate, resulting in the depopulation of the region.\nEarly Islamic period.\nIn the 7th century Cilicia was invaded by the Muslim Arabs. The area was for some time an embattled no-man's land. The Umayyad Caliphate conquered Cilicia around c.\u2009700. Under the Abbasid Caliphate, Cilicia was resettled and transformed into a fortified frontier zone (\"thughur\"). Tarsus, re-built in 787/788, quickly became the largest settlement in the region and the Arabs' most important base in their raids across the Taurus Mountains into Byzantine-held Anatolia.\nIn medieval Arabic Cilicia was known as \"Ath-Thugur As-Shamiyya\" meaning \"Levantine outskirts\".\nThe Muslims held the country until it was reoccupied by the Emperor Nicephorus II in 965. During the Byzantine resettlement of Cilicia, many Armenians migrated to Cilicia, where they founded in 1071 the kingdom of Lesser Armenia.\nArmenian Cilicia and the Crusades.\nDuring the time of the First Crusade, the area was controlled by the Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia. The Seljuk Turkish invasions of Armenia were followed by an exodus of Armenians migrating westward into the Byzantine Empire, and in 1080 Ruben, a relative of the last king of Ani, founded in the heart of the Cilician Taurus a small principality which gradually expanded into the Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia. This Christian state, surrounded by Muslim states hostile to its existence, had a stormy history of about 300 years, giving valuable support to the Crusaders, and trading with the great commercial cities of Italy.\nIt prospered for three centuries due to the vast network of fortifications which secured all the major roads as well as the three principal harbours at Ayas, Ko\u0155ikos, and Mopsuestia. Through their complex alliances with the Crusader states, the Armenian barons and kings often invited Crusaders to maintain castles in and along the borders of the Kingdom, including Bagras, Trapessac, T\u201bil Hamtun, Harunia, Selefkia, Amouda, and Sarvandikar.\nGosdantin (r. 1095 \u2013 c.\u00a01100) assisted the Crusaders on their march to Antioch, and was created knight and marquis. Thoros I (r. c.\u00a01100 \u2013 1129), in alliance with the Christian princes of Syria, waged successful wars against the Byzantines and Seljuk Turks. Levon II (Leo the Great (r. 1187\u20131219)), extended the kingdom beyond Mount Taurus and established the capital at Sis. He assisted the Crusaders, was crowned King by the Archbishop of Mainz, and married one of the Lusignans of the Crusader Kingdom of Cyprus.\nMongols.\nHetoum I (r. 1226\u20131270) made an alliance with the Mongols, sending his brother Sempad to the Mongol court in person. The Mongols then assisted with the defence of Cilicia from the Mamluks of Egypt, until the Mongols themselves converted to Islam.\nTurkmens.\nThe Ilkhanate lost cohesion after the death of Abu Sa'id (r. 1316\u20131335), and thus could not support the Armenian Kingdom in guarding Cilicia. Internal conflicts within the Armenian Kingdom and the devastation caused by the Black Death that arrived in 1348, led nomadic T\u00fcrkmens to turn their eyes towards unstable Cilicia. In 1352, Ramazan Beg led Turkmens settled south of \u00c7alda\u011f\u0131 and founded their first settlement, Camili. Later that year, Ramazan Beg visited Cairo and was licensed by the Sultan to establish the new frontier \"Turkmen Emirate\" in Cilicia.\nY\u00fcre\u011fir T\u00fcrkmens lived as a small community for 7 years in southeast of Adana, and named their new land, Y\u00fcre\u011fir.\nCollapse.\nWhen Levon V died (1342), John of Lusignan was crowned king as Gosdantin IV; but he and his successors alienated the native Armenians by attempting to make them conform to the Roman Church, and by giving all posts of honour to Latins, until at last the kingdom, falling prey to internal dissensions, ceded Cilicia Pedias to the Ramadanid-supported Mamluk Sultanate of Egypt in 1375.\nMamluk and Turkmen rule.\nIn 1359, Mamluk Sultanate Army marched into Cilicia and took over Adana and Tarsus, two major cities of the plain, leaving few castles to Armenians. In 1375, Mamluks gained the control of the remaining areas of Cilicia, thus ending the three centuries rule of Armenians. Cilicia Pedias became part of the Mamluk Sultanate in 1375. Mamluk Sultanate authorized Ramazan Beg led T\u00fcrkmen Emirate to administer Cilicia, but took direct control of the towns, Tarsus, Ayas, Sarvandikar, Sis at the four corners of Cilicia plain and appointed an Amir and a Garrison for each. Tarsus, the former capital of Cilicia, were settled by the moors that arrived from Egypt. T\u00fcrkmen Emirate which began to be known as Ramadanids, set the city of Adana as their center of power, and many T\u00fcrkmen families of Y\u00fcre\u011fir origin moved to the city.\nAfter the death of Ramazan Bey, his son Ibrahim Bey made alliance with the Karaman Emirate. Alaeddin Bey and Ibrahim Bey together tried to break the Mameluks' might in the province. After this alliance a great Mameluk army moved in and began to plunder but Ibrahim Bey's army achieved a great victory against the Mameluks in Belen. Also in this battle Temur Bey, the general of the Mameluks, had been captured. Yilboga, the amir of Aleppo moved on to the Turkmens after this defeat and he conquered Misis Castle.\nRamadanids were the only emirate in Anatolia that were not a successor of the Anatolian Seljuk Sultanate. They are often misclassified as an Anatolian beylik, though they were an entity under Mamluks. The Ramadanids played an important role in 15th century Ottoman-Mamluk relations, being a buffer state located in the Mamluk \"al-'Awasim\" frontier zone. Cilicia were one of the last regions of Anatolia to fall under Turkish rule, and were part of the Seljuqs for a short time, thus were not effected from Sunni tariqa expansionism of the 13th century. Y\u00fcre\u011fir Turks moved to Cilicia in the late 14th century, and had a distinct culture that influenced from Bektashi traditions which accompanied Shamanic rituals with Islam. Living together and having cultural exchange with the large Armenian community, Y\u00fcre\u011fir Turks flourished a laid back culture.\nThe Karamanid Principality, one of the Turkmen Anatolian beyliks emerged after the collapse of the Anatolian Seljuks, took over the rule of Cilicia Thracea.\nOttoman period.\nIn 1516, Selim I incorporated the beylik into the Ottoman Empire after his conquest of the Mamluk state. The beys of Ramadanids held the administration of the Ottoman sanjak of Adana in a hereditary manner until 1608, with the area serving as a vassal of the Ottomans.\nOttomans ended the Ramadanid administration of Adana sanjak in 1608, ruling it directly from Constantinople then after. The autonomous sanjak was then split from the Aleppo Eyalet and established as a new province under the name of Adana Eyalet. A governor was appointed to administer the province. In late 1832, Eyalet of Egypt Vali Muhammad Ali Pasha invaded Syria, and reached Cilicia. The Convention of K\u00fctahya that was signed on 14 May 1833, ceded Cilicia to the \"de facto\" independent Egypt.\nAlawites brought to Cilicia from Syria to work at the flourishing agricultural lands. \u0130brahim Pa\u015fa, the son of Muhammed Ali Pa\u015fa, demolished the Adana Castle and the city walls in 1836. He built the canals for irrigation and transportation and also built water systems for the residential areas of the towns. Adana had the infrastructure it needed by the second half of the 19th century to become major center of Southeastern Anatolia.\nAfter the Oriental crisis, the Convention of Alexandria that was signed on 27 November 1840, required the return of Cilicia to Ottoman sovereignty. The American Civil War that broke out in 1861 disturbed the cotton flow to Europe and directed European cotton traders to fertile Cilicia. The region became the centre of cotton trade and one of the most economically strong regions of the Empire within decades. In 1869, Adana Eyalet was re-established as Adana Vilayet, after the re-structuring in the Ottoman Administration. Adana\u2013Mersin railway line was opened in 1886, connecting Cilicia to international ports through Port of Mersin.\nA thriving regional economy, the doubling of Cilician Armenian population due to flee from the Hamidian massacres, and the end of autocratic Abdulhamid rule with the revolution of 1908, empowered the Armenian community and envisioned an autonomous Cilicia. Enraged supporters of Abdulhamid that organized under Cemiyet-i Muhammediye amidst the countercoup, led to a series of anti-Armenian pogroms in 14\u201327 April 1909. The Adana massacre resulted in the deaths of roughly 25,000 Armenians, orphaned 3500 children and caused heavy destruction of Christian neighbourhoods in the entire Vilayet.\nThe Cilicia section of the Berlin\u2013Baghdad railway was opened in 1912, connecting the region to the Middle East. Over the course of the Armenian genocide, an Ottoman telegraph was received by the Governor to deport the more than 70,000 Armenians of the Adana Vilayet to Syria. Armenians of Zeitun had organized a successful resistance against the Ottoman onslaught. In order to finally subjugate Zeitun, the Ottomans had to resort to treachery by forcing an Armenian delegation from Marash to ask the \"Zeituntsi\"s to put down their arms. Both the Armenian delegation, and later, the inhabitants of Zeitun, were left with no choice.\nModern era.\nArmistice of Mudros that was signed on 30 October 1918 to end the World War I, ceded the control of Cilicia to France. French Government sent four battalions of the Armenian Legion in December to take over and oversee the repatriation of more than 170,000 Armenians to Cilicia. Returning Armenians negotiated with France to establish an autonomous \"State of Cilicia\". The Armenians formed the Armenian National Union which acted as an unofficial Cilician Armenian government composed of the four major political parties and three Armenian religious denominations. Mihran Damadian, the chief negotiator for Armenians, signed the provisional \"Constitution of Cilicia\" in 1919 to bring new order to the region.\nThe French forces were spread too thinly in the region and, as they came under withering attacks by Muslim elements both opposed and loyal to Mustafa Kemal Pasha, eventually reversed their policies in the region. A truce arranged on 28 May between the French and the Kemalists, led to the retreat of the French forces south of the Mersin-Osmaniye railroad.\nWith the changing political environment and interests, the French further reversed their policy: The repatriation was halted, and the French ultimately abandoned all pretensions to Cilicia, which they had originally hoped to attach to their mandate over Syria. Cilicia Peace Treaty was signed on 9 March 1921 between France and Turkish Grand National Assembly. The treaty did not achieve the intended goals and was replaced with the Treaty of Ankara that was signed on 20 October 1921. Based on the terms of the agreement, France recognized the end of the Cilicia War, and French troops together with the remaining Armenian volunteers withdrew from the region in early January 1922.\nMaronite community were re-settled in Lebanon by the French Administration. Later in 1922, roughly 10,000 Greeks were forced to move to Greece by the policy of Greco-Turkish population exchange. Cilicia Armenians settled in Lebanon, at the newly founded Armenian Bourj Hammoud town, just north-east of Beirut. From the 1920s, around 60 percent of the Cilician Armenians moved to Argentina. An informal census of 1941 revealed that, 70 percent of all the Armenian Argentines in Buenos Aires had Adana origins.\nRepublic of Turkey.\nThe region become part of the Republic of Turkey in 1921 with the signing of the Treaty of Ankara. On 15 April 1923, just before the signing of the Treaty of Lausanne, the Turkish government enacted the \"Law of Abandoned Properties\" which confiscated properties of Armenians and Greeks who were not present on their property. Cilicia were one of the regions with the most confiscated property, thus muhacirs (en: immigrants) from Balkans and Crete were relocated in the old Armenian and Greek neighbourhoods and villages of the region. All types of properties, lands, houses and workshops were distributed to them. Also during this period, there was a property rush of Muslims from Kayseri and Darende to Cilicia who were granted the ownership of large farms, factories, stores and mansions. Within a decade, Cilicia had a sharp change demographically, socially and economically and lost its diversity by turning into solely Muslim/Turkish.\nRemaining Jews and Christians were hit by the heavy burden of the Wealth Tax in 1942, which caused them to leave Cilicia, selling their properties for peanuts to families like Sabanc\u0131, who built their wealth on owning confiscated or cheaply purchased properties. Forcible change in means of production led to abuse of wealth and harsh treatment of labor later in the 20th century, as the new possessors did not have the necessary management attributes that the previous owners had for centuries.\nLegacy.\nAccording to one Greek myth, Cilicia was named after Cilix (), a Phoenician who went to live there after searching for his sister Europa following the instructions of his father, the king Agenor of Tyre or Sidon.\nIn another Greek myth, the name of Cilicia was derived from a people named the (), who were Greeks who originally lived in the Troad, and who settled the coastland of Cilicia under the leadership of the seer Mopsus. The Karatepe Luwian-Phoenician bilingual inscription mentions the House of Mopsus (; ) as the reigning dynasty of the kingdom of \u1e2aiyawa.\nSociety and culture.\nAncient.\nEthnicity.\nThe inhabitants of Ancient Cilicia were Luwians who had settled in this region in the 2nd millennium BC, and Cilicia itself had become an important centre of Luwian settlement in Anatolia in the aftermath of the Late Bronze Age collapse.\nThis Luwian population persisted in Cilicia in the 1st millennium BC until the later Hellenistic and Roman periods, hence why the onomastics of this region, especially in its western part (Rough Cilicia), were Luwian in character, implying that it was inhabited by a large number of Luwian speakers until the early 1st millennium AD.\nPersian influence.\nLike in the rest of the western satrapies of the Achaemenid Empire, Persians had moved in Cilicia, and archaeological evidence such as reliefs from Silifke, Adana and Korykos suggest that a Persian nobility as well as a Persianised nobility existed in Cilicia during the Achaemenid period.\nCultural diversity.\nAchaemenid and post-Achaemenid Cilicia was culturally very diverse, as attested by:\nSocial organisation.\nThe population of the eastern part of ancient Cilicia was urbanised and participated in commercial and industrial activities, while the inhabitants of its western regions were tribally organised and led simpler lifestyles.\nModern.\nSignificant Christian communities (Antiochian Greek Christians and Armenians) are found in Adana, \u0130skenderun, and Mersin.\nAdministrative structure.\nAncient.\nTemple estates had existed in Cilicia since the pre-Achaemenid period, although the best documentation regarding them is from the Hellenestic period. Known temple estates include the temple of Zeus at Olb\u0113 and the temple of Artemis Perasia at Kastabala.\nAchaemenid.\nLike the other western satrapies of the Achaemenid Empire, the satrap of Cilicia owned an estate with a palace at Tarsus, which was a large and thriving city during the Achaemenid period. Subordinate to the satrap in the local administration were lower rank officials, with some of them being landed aristocrats owning estates and villages, and others being priests in the sanctuaries of Cilicia who administered the temple estates, as well as other even lesser officials.\nThe temple estates persisted through the Achaemenid period, implying that their existence was not perceived as detrimental to the authority of the satrap of Cilicia.\nThe duties of the satrap including maintaining peace within his satrapy to ensure agriculture could be conducted and tribute could be produced, as well as to keep the locations at higher altitudes and the mountain passes under control loyal to the Achaemenid crown, to which it contributed 360 horses and 140 talents of silver for defence.\nCilicia also provided troops to the land and maritime military forces of the Achaemenid Empire, and the satrapy itself acted as an assembly point for them.\nLittle is known of the large cities in the Achaemenid period, although Tarsus and Soli are known to have minted coins which were used in the Achaemenid military campaigns against Cyprus and Egypt.\nDuring the Achaemenid period, the administration of Cilicia was stable and efficient, thanks to which it was agriculturally very productive and was capable of holding large military concentrations. The fact that the king of kings Darius I expected 500 talents of silver as tribute from Cilicia attests that its administration was of the necessary competence to generate a revenue that was more than trivial.\nHellenistic.\nIn the Hellenistic period, the Cilician temple estates adopted Greek culture under the influence of Seleucid administration:\nModern.\nModern Cilicia is split into four administrative provinces: Mersin, Adana, Osmaniye and Hatay. Each province is governed by the Central Government in Ankara through an appointed Provincial governor. Provinces are then divided into districts governed by the District Governors who are under the provincial governors.\nReligion.\nAncient.\nReflecting the diversity of Cilicia in the Achaemenid and post-Achaemenid periods, various deities of different origins have been attested there in antiquity:\nAs a result of the strong impact of 200 years of rule by the Persian Achaemenid Empire, fire altars and magi were still present at Tarsus and in the rest of Cilicia in the c.\u2009260s AD, as recorded by the Sasanian high priest Kartir.\nDemographics.\nCilicia is heavily populated due to its abundant resources, climate and plain geography. The population of Cilicia as of 31 December 2022 is 6,435,986.\nHatay is the most rural province of Cilicia and also Hatay is the only province that the rural population is rising and the urban population is declining. The major reason is the mountainous geography of Hatay.\nAdana Province is the most urbanized province, with most of the population centred in the city of Adana. Mersin Province has a larger rural population than Adana Province, owing to its long and narrow stretch of flat land in between the Taurus Mountains and the Mediterranean.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Largest_cities/styles.css\" /&gt;\nEconomy.\nCilicia is well known for the vast fertile land and highly productive agriculture. The region is also industrialized; Tarsus, Adana and Ceyhan host numerous plants. Mersin and \u0130skenderun seaports provide transportation of goods manufactured in Central, South and Southeast Anatolia. Ceyhan hosts oil, natural gas terminals as well as refineries and shipbuilders.\nNatural resources.\nAgriculture.\nThe Cilicia plain has some of the most fertile soil in the world in which 3 harvests can be taken each year. The region has the second richest flora in the world and it is the producer of all agricultural products of Turkey except hazelnut and tobacco. Cilicia leads Turkey in soy, peanuts and corn harvest and is a major producer of fruits and vegetables. Half of Turkey's citrus export is from Cilicia. Anamur is the only sub-tropical area of Turkey where bananas, mango, kiwi and other sub-tropical produce can be harvested.\nCilicia is the second largest honey producer in Turkey after the Mu\u011fla\u2013Ayd\u0131n region. Samanda\u011f, Yumurtal\u0131k, Karata\u015f and Bozyaz\u0131 are some of the towns in the region where fishing is the major source of income. Gray mullet, red mullet, sea bass, lagos, calamari and gilt-head bream are some of the most popular fish in the region. There are aquaculture farms in Akyatan, Akya\u011fan, Yumurtal\u0131k lakes and at Seyhan Reservoir. While not as common as other forms of agriculture, dairy and livestock are also produced throughout the region.\nManufacturing.\nCilicia is one of the first industrialized regions of Turkey. With the improvements in agriculture and the spike of agricultural yield, agriculture-based industries are built in large numbers. Today, the manufacturing industry is mainly concentrated around Tarsus, Adana and Ceyhan. Textile, leather tanning and food processing plants are plentiful. \u0130sdemir is a large steel plant located in \u0130skenderun.\nThe petrochemical industry is rapidly developing in the region with the investments around the Ceyhan Oil Terminal. Petroleum refineries are being built in the area. Ceyhan is also expected to host the shipbuilding industry.\nCommerce.\nAdana is the commercial centre of the region where many of the public and private institutions have their regional offices. Mersin and Antakya are also home to regional offices of public institutions. Many industry fairs and congresses are held in the region at venues such as the T\u00dcYAP Congress and Exhibition Centre in Adana and the Mersin Congress Centre.\nMersin Seaport is the third largest seaport in Turkey, after Istanbul and \u0130zmir. There are 45 piers in the port. The total area of the port is , and the capacity is 6,000 ships per year.\n\u0130skenderun Seaport is used mostly for transfers to Middle East and Southeastern Turkey.\nCeyhan Oil Terminal is a marine transport terminal for the Baku\u2013Tbilisi\u2013Ceyhan pipeline (the \"BTC\"), the Kirkuk\u2013Ceyhan Oil Pipeline, the planned Samsun-Ceyhan and the Ceyhan-Red Sea pipelines. Ceyhan will also be a natural gas terminal for a planned pipeline to be constructed parallel to the Kirkuk-Ceyhan oil pipeline, and for a planned extension of the Blue Stream Gas Pipeline from Samsun to Ceyhan.\nD\u00f6rtyol Oil Terminal is a marine transport terminal for Batman-D\u00f6rtyol oil pipeline which started operating in 1967 to market Batman oil. The pipeline is 511\u00a0km long and has an annual capacity of 3.5\u00a0million tons.\nTourism.\nWhile the region has a long coastline, international tourism is not at the level of the neighbouring Antalya Province. There are a small number of hotels between Erdemli and Anamur that attracts tourists. Cilicia tourism is mostly cottage tourism serving the Cilicia locals as well as residents of Kayseri, Gaziantep and surrounding areas. Between Silifke and Mersin, high-rise and low-rise cottages line the coast, leaving almost no vacant land. The coastline from Mersin to Karata\u015f is mostly farmland. This area is zoned for resort tourism and is expected to have a rapid development within the next 20 years. Karata\u015f and Yumurtal\u0131k coasts are home to cottages with a bird conservatory between the two areas. Arsuz is a seaside resort that is mostly frequented by Antakya and \u0130skenderun residents.\nPlateaus on the Taurus mountains are cooler escapes for the locals who wants to chill out from hot and humid summers of the lower plains. G\u00f6zne and \u00c7aml\u0131yayla (Namrun) in Mersin Province, Tekir, B\u00fcr\u00fccek and K\u0131z\u0131lda\u011f in Adana Province, Zorkun in Osmaniye Province and So\u011fukoluk in Hatay Province are the popular high plain resorts of Cilicia which are often crowded in summer. There are a few hotels and camping sites in the Tekir plateau.\nBalneary tourism.\nThe region is a popular destination for thermal springs. Hamamat Thermal Spring, located on midway from K\u0131r\u0131khan to Reyhanl\u0131, has a very high sulphur ratio, making it the second in the world after a thermal spring in India. It is the largest spa in the region and attracts many Syrians due to proximity. Haruniye Thermal Spring is located on the banks of the Ceyhan River near D\u00fczi\u00e7i town and has a serene environment. Thermal springs are a hot spot for people with rheumatism. Kurttepe, Alihocal\u0131 and Il\u0131ca mineral springs, all located in Adana Province, are popular for toxic cleansing. Ottoman Palace Thermal Resort &amp; Spa in Antakya is one of Turkey's top resorts for revitalization.\nReligious tourism.\nLying at a crossroads of three major religions, namely Judaism, Christianity and Islam, the region is home to numerous landmarks that are important for people of faith. Tarsus is the birthplace of Paul the Apostle, who returned to the city after his conversion. The city was a stronghold of Christians after his death. Ashab-\u0131 Kehf cavern, one of the locations claimed to be the resting place of the legendary Seven Sleepers, holy to Christians and Muslims, is located north of Tarsus.\nAntakya is another destination for the spiritual world, where, according to the New Testament the followers of Jesus Christ were first called Christians. the Church of Saint Peter near Antakya (Antioch) is one of Christianity's oldest churches. It is the home of Saint Peter, one of the 12 apostles of Jesus. Antioch was called \"the cradle of Christianity\" as a result of its longevity and the pivotal role that it played in the emergence of both Hellenistic Judaism and early Christianity,\nPlaces of interest.\nAncient sites.\nKizkalesi (Maiden Castle), a fort on a small island across K\u0131zkalesi township, was built during the early 12th century by Armenian kings of the Rubeniyan dynasty to defend the city of Korykos (present-day K\u0131zkalesi).\nHeaven &amp; Hell, situated on a large hill north of Narl\u0131kuyu, consists of the grabens resulting from assoil of furrings for thousands of years. The natural phenomenon of the grabens is named 'Hell &amp; Heaven' because of the exotic effects on people. Visitors can access the cave of the mythological giant Typhon.\nThe ancient Roman town of Soloi-Pompeiopolis, near the city of Mersin.\nY\u0131lanl\u0131 Kale (Castle of Serpents), an 11th-century Crusader castle built on a historical road connecting the Taurus mountains with the city of Antakya. The castle has 8 round towers, a military guardhouse and a church. It is located 5\u00a0km. west of Ceyhan.\nAnazarbus Castle, built in the 3rd century, served as the centre of the ancient metropolis of Anavarza. The city was built on a hill and had strategic importance, controlling the Cilician plain. The main castle and the city walls represent remains of the city. The city wall is 1500\u00a0m. long and 8-10m. high, with 4 entrances to the city. The castle is located 80\u00a0km. northeast of Adana.\n\u015ear (Comona), an ancient city located in northernmost Cilicia, some 200\u00a0km. north of Adana, near Tufanbeyli. It was an historical centre of the Hittites. Remaining structures today include the amphitheatre built during the Roman period, ruins of a church from the Byzantine era and Hittite rock-works.\nThe Church of St. Peter in Antakya was a cave on the slopes of Habibi Neccar mountain converted into a church. The church is known as the first Christians' traditional meeting place. Pope Paul VI declared the church a \"Place of Pilgrimage\" for Christians in 1963, and since then a special ceremony takes place on 29 June each year.\nSt. Simeon Monastery, a 6th-century giant structure built on a desolate hill 18\u00a0km south of Antakya. The most striking features of this monastery are its cisterns, its storage compartment, and the walls. It is believed that St. Simeon resided here atop a 20-meter stone column for 45 years.\nParks and conservation areas.\nAkyatan Lagoon is a large wildlife refuge which acts as a stopover for migratory birds voyaging from Africa to Europe. The wildlife refuge has a area made up of forests, lagoon, marsh, sandy and reedy lands. Akyatan lake is a natural wonder with endemic plants and endangered bird species living in it together with other species of plants and animals. 250 species of birds are observed during a study in 1990. The conservation area is located 30\u00a0km south of Adana, near Tuzla.\nYumurtal\u0131k Nature Reserve covers an area of 16,430 hectares within the Seyhan-Ceyhan delta, with its lakes, lagoons and wide collection of plant and animal species. The area is an important location for many species of migrating birds, the number gets higher during the winters when the lakes become a shelter when other lakes further north freeze.\nAlada\u011flar National Park, located north of Adana, is a huge park of around 55,000 hectares, the summit of Demirkazik at 3756\u00a0m is the highest point in the middle Taurus mountain range. There is a huge range of flora and fauna, and visitors may fish in the streams full of trout. Wildlife includes wild goats, bears, lynx and sable. The most common species of plant life is black pine and cluster pine trees, with some cedar dotted between, and fir trees in the northern areas with higher humidity. The Alpine region, from the upper borders of the forest, has pastures with rocky areas and little variety of plant life because of the high altitude and slope.\nKaratepe-Aslanta\u015f National Park located on the west bank of Ceyhan River in Osmaniye Province. The park includes the Karatepe Hittite fortress and an open-air museum.\nTekk\u00f6z-Kengerlid\u00fcz Nature Reserve, located 30\u00a0km north of D\u00f6rtyol, is known for having an ecosystem different from the Mediterranean. The main species of trees around Kengerliduz are beech, oak and fir, and around Tekkoz are hornbeam, ash, beach, black pine and silver birch. The main animal species in the area are wild goat, roe deer, bear, hyena, wild cat, wagtail, wolf, jackal and fox.\nHabibi Neccar Da\u011f\u0131 Nature Reserve is famous for its cultural as well as natural value, especially for St Pierre Church, which was carved into the rocks. The Charon monument, 200\u00a0m north of the church, is huge sculpture of Haron, known as Boatman of Hell in mythology, carved into the rocks. The main species of tree are cluster pine, oaks and sandalwood. The mountain is also home to foxes, rabbits, partridges and stock doves. Nature reserve is 10\u00a0km east of Antakya and can be accessible by public transport.\nEducation.\nThere are numerous private primary and high schools besides the state schools in the region. Most popular high school in the region is Tarsus American College, founded as a missionary school in 1888 to serve Armenian community and then became a secular school in 1923.

Adana-Mersin train runs as a commuter train between Mersin, Tarsus and Adana. There are also regional trains from Adana to Ceyhan, Osmaniye and \u0130skenderun.\nSociety.\nCilicia was one of the most important regions for the Ottoman Armenians because it managed very well to preserve Armenian character throughout the years. In fact, the Cilician highlands were densely populated by Armenians in small but prosperous towns and villages such as Hadjin and Zeitun, two mountainous areas where autonomy was maintained until the 19th century. In ports and cities of the Adana plain, commerce and industry were almost entirely in the hands of the Armenians and they remained so thanks to a constant influx of Armenians from the highlands. Their population was continuously increasing in numbers in Cilicia in contrast to other parts of the Ottoman Empire, where it was, since 1878, decreasing due to repression.\nExplanatory notes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is bordered to the north by French Guiana and Suriname.\nHistory.\nTumucumaque was declared a national park on August 23, 2002, by the Government of Brazil, after collaboration with the WWF. \nIt is part of the Amap\u00e1 Biodiversity Corridor, created in 2003.\nThe conservation unit is supported by the Amazon Region Protected Areas Program. Its Management Plan was published on March 10, 2010.\nGeography.\nTumucumaque Mountains National Park has an area of more than , making it the world's largest tropical forest national park and larger than Belgium. This area even reaches when including the bordering Guiana Amazonian Park, a national park in French Guiana. \nThis combination of protected areas is still smaller than the three national parks system in the Brazil-Venezuelan border, where the Parima-Tapirapeco, Serran\u00eda de la Neblina and Pico da Neblina national parks have a combined area of over .\nBut the latter is certainly smaller if the Tumucumaque Mountains National Park (Brazil) and the adjacent Guiana Amazonian Park (France) is combined with large neighbouring protected areas in northern Par\u00e1, Brazil, such as Gr\u00e3o-Par\u00e1 Ecological Station, Maicuru Biological Reserve, and many others. The importance is that this makes the Guiana Shield one of the best protected and largest ecological corridor of tropical rainforests in the world. It is an \"uninhabited\" region and is of high ecological value: most of its animal species, mainly fish and aquatic birds, are not found in any other place in the world. \nIt is a habitat for jaguars, primates, aquatic turtles, and harpy eagles.\nThe highest point of the Brazilian state of Amap\u00e1 is located there, reaching 701 meters.\nClimate.\nThe climate is tropical monsoon (K\u00f6ppen: \"Am\"), common in areas of northern Brazil in transition from biomes to the Amazon Forest. It has an average temperature of 25\u00a0\u00b0C (77\u00a0\u00b0F) and accumulated rainfall ranging from 2,000 (78.84\u00a0in) to 3,250\u00a0mm (127.95\u00a0in) per year.\nTourism.\nTourism in the Park takes place in two different sectors: Amapari Sector and Oiapoque Sector.\nAt Amapar\u00ed Sector, the Park is accessed by Serra do Navio city (most common) or by a community in Pedra Branca do Amapari (usually in the summer). The trip is made by the Amapari River, using aluminum boats (90 km from Serra do Navio) to the park's rustic base, where it is possible to stay in a camping structure adapted to Amazonian conditions (hammocks) and do activities such as trails, bathing in rivers and animal and plants watching.\nAt Oiapoque Sector, you can camp at Cachoeira do Anotaie, which is located on the Anotaie River, a tributary of the Oiapoque River. This waterfall is 40 km from the city of Oiapoque, on a trip using aluminum boats. There is also the possibility to visit Vila Brasil, a community located on the right bank of the Oiapoque River and located in front of the French-Guyanese indigenous community of Camopi. In this location there are small hotels and it is possible to understand its socio-cultural context, where the residents, mostly traders, provide services to the indigenous people of the neighboring country.\nLegacy.\nMozilla Firefox code-named the beta of Firefox 4 Tumucumaque.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "75469", "revid": "49335840", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=75469", "title": "Ideology", "text": "Set of beliefs or values\nAn ideology is a set of beliefs or values attributed to a person or group of persons, especially those held for reasons that are not purely about belief in certain knowledge, in which \"practical elements are as prominent as theoretical ones\". Formerly applied primarily to economic, political, or religious theories and policies, in a tradition going back to Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, more recent use treats the term as mainly condemnatory.\nThe term was coined by Antoine Destutt de Tracy, a French Enlightenment aristocrat and philosopher, who conceived it in 1796 as the \"science of ideas\" to develop a rational system of ideas to oppose the irrational impulses of the mob. In political science, the term is used in a descriptive sense to refer to political belief systems.\nEtymology.\nThe term \"ideology\" originates from French , itself coined from combining (; close to the Lockean sense of \"idea\") and \"-log\u00ed\u0101\" ().\nAn \"ideologue\" is someone who strongly believes in an ideology. The term carries negative connotations, often referring to someone who is blindly partisan, zealous, or fanatical in their beliefs.\nHistory.\nThe term \"ideology\" and the system of ideas associated with it were developed in 1796 by Antoine Destutt de Tracy (1754\u20131836), who crystallised his ideas while in prison (November 1793 to October 1794) pending trial during the Reign of Terror of c.\u20091793 to July 1794. While imprisoned he read the works of Locke and \u00c9tienne Bonnot de Condillac.\nHoping to form a secure foundation for the moral and political sciences, Tracy devised the term for a \"science of ideas\", basing such upon two things: (1) the sensations that people experience as they interact with the material world; and (2) the ideas that form in their minds due to those sensations. Tracy conceived of \"ideology\" as a liberal philosophy that would defend individual liberty, property, free markets, and constitutional limits on state power. He argues that, among these aspects, ideology is the most generic term because the 'science of ideas' also contains the study of their expression and deduction. The coup d'\u00e9tat that overthrew Maximilien Robespierre in July 1794 allowed Tracy to pursue his work. Tracy reacted to the terroristic phase of the revolution (during the Napoleonic regime of 1799 to 1815 as part of the Napoleonic Wars) by trying to work out a rational system of ideas to oppose the irrational mob-impulses that had nearly destroyed him.\nA subsequent early source for the near-original meaning of \"ideology\" is Hippolyte Taine's work on the Ancien R\u00e9gime, \"Origins of Contemporary France\" () volume I (1875). He describes \"ideology\" as rather like teaching philosophy via the Socratic method, though without extending the vocabulary beyond what the general reader already possessed, and without the examples from observation that practical science would require. Taine identifies it not just with Tracy but also with his milieu, and includes Condillac as one of its precursors.\nNapoleon Bonaparte (1769\u20131821) came to view \"ideology\" as a term of abuse, which he often hurled against his liberal foes in Tracy's \"Institut national\". According to Karl Mannheim's historical reconstruction of the shifts in the meaning of \"ideology\", the modern meaning of the word was born when Napoleon used it to describe his opponents as \"the ideologues\". Tracy's major book, \"The Elements of Ideology\" (, published 1804\u20131815), was soon translated into major European languages.\nIn the century following Tracy's formulations, the term \"ideology\" moved back and forth between positive and negative connotations. When post-Napoleonic governments adopted a reactionary stance, the concept influenced the Italian, Spanish and Russian thinkers who had begun to describe themselves as \"liberals\" and who attempted to reignite revolutionary activity in the early 1820s, including the Carbonari societies in France and Italy and the Decembrists in Russia. Karl Marx (1818\u20131883) adopted Napoleon's negative sense of the term, using it in his writings, in which he once described Tracy as a (a \"fish-blooded bourgeois doctrinaire\"). The term has since dropped some of its pejorative sting (euphemism treadmill), and has become a neutral term in the analysis of differing political opinions and views of social groups. While Marx situated the term within class struggle and domination, others believed it was a necessary part of institutional functioning and social integration.\nIn parallel with post-Soviet Russian ideas about the mono-ideologies of (for example) monotheism, Walter Brueggemann (1933\u20132025) has examined \"ideological extension\" in historical religious/political contexts.\nDefinitions and analysis.\nThere are many different kinds of ideologies, including political, social, epistemological, and ethical. Recent analysis tends to posit that \"ideology\" is a 'coherent system of ideas' that rely on a few basic assumptions about reality that may or may not have any factual basis. Through this system, ideas become coherent, repeated patterns through the subjective ongoing choices that people make. These ideas serve as the seed around which further thought grows. The belief in an ideology can range from passive acceptance up to fervent advocacy. Definitions, such as by Manfred Steger and Paul James, emphasize both the issue of patterning and contingent claims to truth. They wrote: \"Ideologies are patterned clusters of normatively imbued ideas and concepts, including particular representations of power relations. These conceptual maps help people navigate the complexity of their political universe and carry claims to social truth.\"\nStudies of the concept of ideology itself (rather than specific ideologies) have been carried out under the name of \"systematic ideology\" in the works of George Walford and Harold Walsby, who attempt to explore the relationships between ideology and social systems. David W. Minar describes six different ways the word \"ideology\" has been used:\nFor Willard A. Mullins, an \"ideology\" should be contrasted with the related (but different) issues of \"utopia\" and \"historical myth\". An ideology is composed of four basic characteristics:\nTerry Eagleton outlines (more or less in no particular order) some definitions of ideology:\nGerman philosopher Christian Duncker called for a \"critical reflection of the ideology concept\". In his work, he strove to bring the concept of ideology into the foreground, as well as the closely connected concerns of epistemology and history, defining \"ideology\" in terms of a system of presentations that explicitly or implicitly lay claim to absolute truth.\nMarxist interpretation.\nMarx's analysis sees ideology as a system of consciousness that arises from economic relationships, reflecting and perpetuating the interests of the dominant class.\nIn the Marxist base and superstructure model of society, \"base\" denotes the relations of production and modes of production, and \"superstructure\" denotes the dominant ideology (i.e. religious, legal, political systems). The economic base of production determines the political superstructure of a society. Ruling class-interests determine the superstructure and the nature of the justifying ideology\u2014actions feasible because the ruling class control the means of production. For example, in a feudal mode of production, religious ideology is the most prominent aspect of the superstructure, while in capitalist formations, ideologies such as liberalism and social democracy dominate. Hence the great importance of ideology justifies a society and politically confuses the alienated groups of society via false consciousness. Some explanations have been presented. Antonio Gramsci uses cultural hegemony to explain why the working-class have a false ideological conception of what their best interests are. Marx argued: \"The class which has the means of material production at its disposal has control at the same time over the means of mental production.\"\nThe Marxist formulation of \"ideology as an instrument of social reproduction\" is conceptually important to the sociology of knowledge, viz. Karl Mannheim, Daniel Bell, and J\u00fcrgen Habermas et al. Moreover, Mannheim has developed and progressed from the \"total\" but \"special\" Marxist conception of ideology to a \"general\" and \"total\" ideological conception acknowledging that all ideology (including Marxism) resulted from social life, an idea developed by the sociologist Pierre Bourdieu. Slavoj \u017di\u017eek and the earlier Frankfurt School added to the \"general theory\" of ideology a psychoanalytic insight that ideologies do not include only conscious but also unconscious ideas.\nIdeology and the commodity (Debord).\nThe French Marxist theorist Guy Debord, founding member of the Situationist International, argued that when the commodity becomes the \"essential category\" of society, i.e. when the process of commodification has been consummated to its fullest extent, the image of society propagated by the commodity (as it describes all of life as constituted by notions and objects deriving their value only as commodities tradeable in terms of exchange value), colonizes all of life and reduces society to a mere representation, The Society of the Spectacle.\nUnifying agents (Hoffer).\nThe American philosopher Eric Hoffer identified several elements that unify followers of a particular ideology:\nRonald Inglehart.\nRonald Inglehart of the University of Michigan is author of the World Values Survey, which, since 1980, has mapped social attitudes in 100 countries representing 90% of global population. Results indicate that where people live is likely to closely correlate with their ideological beliefs. In much of Africa, South Asia and the Middle East, people prefer traditional beliefs and are less tolerant of liberal values. Protestant Europe, at the other extreme, adheres more to secular beliefs and liberal values. Alone among high-income countries, the United States is exceptional in its adherence to traditional beliefs, in this case Christianity.\nPolitical ideologies.\nIn political science, a political ideology is a certain ethical set of ideals, principles, doctrines, myths, or symbols of a social movement, institution, class, or large group that explains how society should work, offering some political and cultural blueprint for a certain social order. Political ideologies are concerned with many different aspects of a society, including but not limited to: the economy, the government, the environment, education, health care, labor law, criminal law, the justice system, social security and welfare, public policy and administration, foreign policy, rights, freedoms and duties, citizenship, immigration, culture and national identity, military administration, and religion.\nPolitical ideologies have two dimensions:\nA political ideology largely concerns itself with how to allocate power and to what ends power should be used. Some parties follow a certain ideology very closely, while others may take broad inspiration from a group of related ideologies without specifically embracing any one of them. Each political ideology contains certain ideas on what it considers the best form of government (e.g., democracy, demagogy, theocracy, caliphate etc.), scope of government (e.g. authoritarianism, libertarianism, federalism, etc.) and the best economic system (e.g. capitalism, socialism, etc.). Sometimes the same word is used to identify both an ideology and one of its main ideas. For instance, \"socialism\" may refer to an economic system, or it may refer to an ideology that supports that economic system. Post 1991, many commentators claim that we are living in a post-ideological age, in which redemptive, all-encompassing ideologies have failed. This view is often associated with Francis Fukuyama's writings on the \"end of history\". Contrastly, Nienhueser (2011) sees research (in the field of human resource management) as ongoingly \"generating ideology\".\nThere are many proposed methods for the classification of political ideologies. Ideologies can identify themselves by their position on the political spectrum (e.g. left, center, or right). They may also be distinguished by single issues around which they may be built (e.g. civil libertarianism, support or opposition to European integration, legalization of marijuana). They may also be distinguished by political strategies (e.g. populism, personalism). The classification of political ideology is difficult, however, due to cultural relativity in definitions. For example, \"what Americans now call conservatism much of the world calls liberalism or neoliberalism\"; a conservatism in Finland would be labeled socialism in the United States.\nPhilosopher Michael Oakeshott defines single-issue ideologies as \"the formalized abridgment of the supposed sub-stratum of the rational truth contained in the tradition\". Moreover, Charles Blattberg offers an account that distinguishes political \"ideologies\" from political \"philosophies\".\nSlavoj \u017di\u017eek argues how the very notion of post-ideology can enable the deepest, blindest form of ideology. A sort of false consciousness or false cynicism, engaged in for the purpose of lending one's point of view the respect of being objective, pretending neutral cynicism, without truly being so. Rather than help avoiding ideology, this lapse only deepens the commitment to an existing one. Zizek calls this \"a post-modernist trap\". Peter Sloterdijk advanced the same idea already in 1988.\nStudies have shown that political ideology is somewhat genetically heritable.\nIdeology and state.\nWhen a political ideology becomes a dominantly pervasive component within a government, one can speak of an \"ideocracy\". Different forms of government use ideology in various ways, not always restricted to politics and society. Certain ideas and schools of thought become favored, or rejected, over others, depending on their compatibility with or use for the reigning social order.\nIn \"The Anatomy of Revolution\", Crane Brinton said that new ideology spreads when there is discontent with an old regime. The may be repeated during revolutions itself; extremists such as Vladimir Lenin and Robespierre may thus overcome more moderate revolutionaries. This stage is soon followed by Thermidor, a reining back of revolutionary enthusiasm under pragmatists like Napoleon and Joseph Stalin, who bring \"normalcy and equilibrium\". Brinton's sequence (\"men of ideas&gt;fanatics&gt;practical men of action\") is reiterated by J. William Fulbright, while a similar form occurs in Eric Hoffer's \"The True Believer\".\nEpistemological ideologies.\nEven when the challenging of existing beliefs is encouraged, as in scientific theories, the dominant paradigm or mindset can prevent certain challenges, theories, or experiments from being advanced. A special case of science that has inspired ideology is ecology, which studies the relationships among living things on Earth. Perceptual psychologist James J. Gibson believed that human perception of ecological relationships was the basis of self-awareness and cognition itself. Linguist George Lakoff has proposed a cognitive science of mathematics wherein even the most fundamental ideas of arithmetic would be seen as consequences or products of human perception\u2014which is itself necessarily evolved within an ecology.\nDeep ecology and the modern ecology movement (and, to a lesser degree, Green parties) appear to have adopted ecological sciences as a positive ideology. Some notable economically based ideologies include neoliberalism, monetarism, mercantilism, mixed economy, social Darwinism, communism, laissez-faire economics, and free trade. There are also current theories of safe trade and fair trade that can be seen as ideologies.\nPsychological explanations of ideology.\nA large amount of research in psychology is concerned with the causes, consequences and content of ideology, with humans being dubbed the \"ideological animal\" by Althusser.269 Many theories have tried to explain the existence of ideology in human societies.269\nJost, Ledgerwood, and Hardin (2008) propose that ideologies may function as prepackaged units of interpretation that spread because of basic human motives to understand the world, avoid existential threat, and maintain valued interpersonal relationships. The authors conclude that such motives may lead disproportionately to the adoption of system-justifying worldviews. Psychologists generally agree that personality traits, individual difference variables, needs, and ideological beliefs seem to have something in common.\nJust-world theory posits that people want to believe in a fair world for a sense of control and security and generate ideologies in order to maintain this belief, for example by justifiying inequality or unfortunate events. A critique of just world theory as a sole explanation of ideology is that it does not explain the differences between ideologies.270\u2013271\nTerror management theory posits that ideology is used as a defence mechanism against threats to their worldview which in turn protect and individuals sense of self-esteem and reduce their awareness of mortality. Evidence shows that priming individuals with an awareness of mortality does not cause individuals to respond in ways underpinned by any particular ideology, but rather the ideology that they are currently aware of.271\nSystem justification theory posits that people tend to defend existing society, even at times against their interest, which in turn causes people to create ideological explanations to justify the status quo. Jost, Fitzimmons and Kay argue that the motivation to protect a preexisting system is due to a desire for cognitive consistency (being able to think in similar ways over time), reducing uncertainty and reducing effort, illusion of control and fear of equality.272 According to system justification theory, ideologies reflect (unconscious) motivational processes, as opposed to the view that political convictions always reflect independent and unbiased thinking.\nIdeology and the social sciences.\nSemiotic theory.\nAccording to semiotician Bob Hodge:[Ideology] identifies a unitary object that incorporates complex sets of meanings with the social agents and processes that produced them. No other term captures this object as well as 'ideology'. Foucault's 'episteme' is too narrow and abstract, not social enough. His 'discourse', popular because it covers some of ideology's terrain with less baggage, is too confined to verbal systems. 'Worldview' is too metaphysical, 'propaganda' too loaded. Despite or because of its contradictions, 'ideology' still plays a key role in semiotics oriented to social, political life.Authors such as Michael Freeden have also recently incorporated a semantic analysis to the study of ideologies.\nSociology.\nSociologists define \"ideology\" as \"cultural beliefs that justify particular social arrangements, including patterns of inequality\". Dominant groups use these sets of cultural beliefs and practices to justify the systems of inequality that maintain their group's social power over non-dominant groups. Ideologies use a society's symbol system to organize social relations in a hierarchy, with some social identities being superior to other social identities, which are considered inferior. The dominant ideology in a society is passed along through the society's major social institutions, such as the media, the family, education, and religion. As societies changed throughout history, so did the ideologies that justified systems of inequality.\nSociological examples of ideologies include racism, sexism, heterosexism, ableism, and ethnocentrism.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "75472", "revid": "1314885541", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=75472", "title": "Transportation planning", "text": "Process of planning for movement of people and goods\nTransportation planning is the process of defining future policies, goals, investments, and spatial planning designs to prepare for future needs to move people and goods to destinations. As practiced today, it is a collaborative process that incorporates the input of many stakeholders including various government agencies, the public and private businesses. Transportation planners apply a multi-modal and/or comprehensive approach to analyzing the wide range of alternatives and impacts on the transportation system to influence beneficial outcomes.\nTransportation planning is also commonly referred to as transport planning internationally, and is involved with the evaluation, assessment, design, and siting of transport facilities (generally streets, highways, bike lanes, and public transport lines).\nModels and sustainability.\nTransportation planning, or transport planning, has historically followed the rational planning model of defining goals and objectives, identifying problems, generating alternatives, evaluating alternatives, and developing plans. Other models for planning include rational actor, transit oriented development, satisficing, incremental planning, organizational process, collaborative planning, and political bargaining.\nPlanners are increasingly expected to adopt a multidisciplinary approach, especially due to the rising importance of environmentalism. For example, the use of behavioural psychology to persuade drivers to abandon their automobiles and use public transport instead. The role of the transport planner is shifting from technical analysis to promoting sustainability through integrated transport policies. For example, in Hanoi, the increasing number of motorcycles is responsible for not only environmental damage but also slowing down economic growth. In the long run, the plan is to reduce traffic through a change in urban planning. Through economic incentives and attractive alternatives experts hope to lighten traffic in the short run.\nWhile quantitative methods of observing transport patterns are considered foundation in transport planning, the role of qualitative and mixed-methods analysis and the use of critical analytical frameworks has increasingly been recognized as a key aspect of transport planning practice which integrates multiple planning criteria in generating, evaluating, and selection policy and project options.\nUnited Kingdom.\nIn the United Kingdom, transport planning has traditionally been a branch of civil engineering. In the 1950s and the 1960s, it was generally believed that the motor car was an important element in the future of transport as economic growth spurred on car ownership figures. The role of the transport planner was to match motorway and rural road capacity against the demands of economic growth. Urban areas would need to be redesigned for the motor vehicle or impose traffic containment and demand management to mitigate congestion and environmental impacts. The policies were popularised in a 1963 government publication, \"Traffic in Towns\". The contemporary Smeed Report on congestion pricing was initially promoted to manage demand but was deemed politically unacceptable. In more recent times, the approach has been caricatured as \"predict and provide\" to predict future transport demand and provide the network for it, usually by building more roads.\nThe publication of Planning Policy Guidance 13 in 1994 (revised in 2001), followed by A New Deal for Transport in 1998 and the white paper Transport Ten Year Plan 2000 again indicated an acceptance that unrestrained growth in road traffic was neither desirable nor feasible. The worries were threefold: concerns about congestion, concerns about the effect of road traffic on the environment (both natural and built) and concerns that an emphasis on road transport discriminates against vulnerable groups in society such as the poor, the elderly and the disabled.\nThese documents reiterated the emphasis on integration:\nThis attempt to reverse decades of underinvestment in the transport system has resulted in a severe shortage of transport planners. It was estimated in 2003 that 2,000 new planners would be required by 2010 to avoid jeopardizing the success of the Transport Ten Year Plan.\nIn 2006, the Transport Planning Society defined the key purpose of transport planning as:\n\"to plan, design, deliver, manage and review transport, balancing the needs of society, the economy and the environment.\"\nThe following key roles must be performed by transport planners:\nThe UK Treasury recognises and has published guidance on the systematic tendency for project appraisers to be overly optimistic in their initial estimates.\nUnited States.\nTransportation planning in the United States is in the midst of a shift similar to that taking place in the United Kingdom, away from the single goal of moving vehicular traffic and towards an approach that takes into consideration the communities and lands through which streets, roads, and highways pass (\"the context\"). More so, it places a greater emphasis on passenger rail networks, which had been neglected until recently. This new approach, known as Context Sensitive Solutions (CSS), seeks to balance the need to move people efficiently and safely with other desirable outcomes, including historic preservation, environmental sustainability, and the creation of vital public spaces.\nThe initial guiding principles of CSS came out of the 1998 \"Thinking Beyond the Pavement\" conference as a means to describe and foster transportation projects that preserve and enhance the natural and built environments, as well as the economic and social assets of the neighborhoods they pass through. CSS principles have since been adopted as guidelines for highway design in federal legislation. Also, in 2003, the Federal Highway Administration announced that under one of its three Vital Few Objectives (Environmental Stewardship and Streamlining) they set the target of achieving CSS integration within all state Departments of Transportation by September 2007.\nIn recent years, there has been a movement to provide \"complete\" transportation corridors under the \"complete streets\" movement. In response to auto-centric design of transportation networks, complete streets encompass all users and modes of transportation in a more equitable manner. The complete streets movement entails many of the CSS principles as well as pedestrian, bicycle and older adult movements to improve transportation in the United States.\nThese recent pushes for changes to the profession of transportation planning has led to the development of a professional certification program by the Institute of Transportation Engineers, the Professional Transportation Planner in 2007. In response an advanced form of certification - the Advanced Specialty Certification in Transportation Planning was developed by the American Planning Association thereafter in 2011. The Certified Transportation Planner credential is only available for those professional planners (AICP members) who have at a minimum of eight years of transportation planning experience.\nTechnical process.\nMost regional transport planners employ what is called the rational model of planning. The model views planning as a logical and technical process that uses the analysis of quantitative data to decide how to best invest resources in new and existing transport infrastructure.\nSince World War II, this attitude in planning has resulted in the widespread use of travel modelling as a key component of regional transport planning. The models' rise in popularity can also be attributed to a rapid increase in the number of automobiles on the road, widespread suburbanization and a large increase in federal or national government spending upon transport in urban areas. All of these phenomena dominated the planning culture in the late 1940s, 1950s and 1960s. Regional transport planning was needed because increasingly cities were not just cities anymore, but parts of a complex regional system.\nThe US process, according to Johnston (2004) and the FHWA and Federal Transit Administration (FTA) (2007), generally follows a pattern which can be divided into three different stages. Over the course of each of three phases, the metropolitan planning organization (MPO) is also supposed to consider air quality and environmental issues, look at planning questions in a fiscally constrained way and involve the public. In the first stage, called preanalysis, the MPO considers what problems and issues the region faces and what goals and objectives it can set to help address those issues. During this phase the MPO also collects data on wide variety of regional characteristics, develops a set of different alternatives that will be explored as part of the planning process and creates a list of measurable outcomes that will be used to see whether goals and objectives have been achieved. Johnston notes that many MPOs perform weakly in this area, and though many of these activities seem like the \"soft\" aspects of planning that are not really necessary, they are absolutely essential to ensuring that the models used in second phase are accurate and complete .\nThe second phase is technical analysis. The process involves much technical maneuvering, but basically the development of the models can be broken down as follows. Before beginning, the MPO collects enormous amounts of data. This data can be thought of as falling into two categories: data about the transport system and data about adjacent land use. The best MPOs are constantly collecting this data.\nThe actual analysis tool used in the US is called the Urban Transportation Modeling System (UTMS), though it is often referred to as the four-step process. As its nickname suggestions, UTMS has four steps: trip generation, trip distribution, mode choice and trip/route assignment. In trip generation, the region is subdivided into a large number of smaller units of analysis called traffic analysis zones (TAZs). Based on the number and characteristics of the households in each zone, a certain number of trips is generated. In the second step, trip distribution, trips are separated out into categories based on their origin and purpose: generally, these categories are home-based work, home-based other and non-home based. In each of three categories, trips are matched to origin and destination zones using the data that has been collected.\nIn mode choice, trips are assigned to a mode (usually auto or transit) based on what's available in a particular zone, the characteristics of the household within that zone and the cost of the mode for each mode in terms of money and time. Since most trips by bicycle or walking are generally shorter, they are assumed to have stayed within one zone and are not included in the analysis. Finally, in route assignment, trips are assigned to the network. As particular parts of the network are assigned trips, the vehicle speed slows down, so some trips are assigned to alternate routes in such a way that all trip times are equal. This is important because the ultimate goal is system-wide optimization, not optimization for any one individual. The finished product is traffic flows and speeds for each link in the network.\nIdeally, these models would include all the different behaviours that are associated with transport, including complex policy questions which are more qualitative in nature. Because of the complexity of transport issues, this is often not possible in practice. This results in models which may estimate future traffic conditions well, but are ultimately based on assumptions made on the part of the planner. Some planners carry out additional sub-system modelling on things like automobile ownership, time of travel, location of land development, location and firms and location of households to help to fill these knowledge gaps, but what are created are nevertheless models, and models always include some level of uncertainty.\nThe post-analysis phase involves plan evaluation, programme implementation and monitoring of the results. Johnston notes that for evaluation to be meaningful it should be as comprehensive as possible. For example, rather than just looking at decreases in congestion, MPOs should consider economic, equity and environmental issues.\nIntersection with politics.\nAlthough a transportation planning process may appear to be a rational process based on standard and objective methodologies, it is often influenced by political processes. Transportation planning is closely interrelated to the public nature of government works projects. As a result, transportation planners play both a technical and a coordinating role. Politicians often have vastly differing perspectives, goals and policy desires. Transportation planners help by providing information to decision makers, such as politicians, in a manner that produces beneficial outcomes. This role is similar to transportation engineers, who are often equally influenced by politics in the technical process of transportation engineering design.\nIntegration with urban planning.\nTransport isochrone maps are a measure of accessibility which can be used by urban planners to evaluate sites.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is the sole species in the monotypic genus, Ricinus, and subtribe, Ricininae.\nIts seed is the castor bean, which despite the term is not a bean (as it is not the seed of a member of the family Fabaceae). Castor is indigenous to the southeastern Mediterranean Basin, East Africa, and India, but is widespread throughout tropical regions (and widely grown elsewhere as an ornamental plant).\nCastor seed is the source of castor oil, which has a wide variety of uses. The seeds contain between 40% and 60% oil that is rich in triglycerides, mainly ricinolein. The seed also contains ricin, a highly potent water-soluble toxin.\nDescription.\n\"Ricinus communis\" can vary greatly in its growth habit and appearance. The variability has been increased by breeders who have selected a range of cultivars for leaf and flower colours, and for oil production. It is a fast-growing, suckering shrub that can reach the size of a small tree, around , but it is not cold hardy.\nThe glossy leaves are long, long-stalked, alternate and palmate with five to twelve deep lobes with coarsely toothed segments. In some varieties they start off dark reddish purple or bronze when young, gradually changing to a dark green, sometimes with a reddish tinge, as they mature. The leaves of some other varieties are green practically from the beginning, whereas in yet others a pigment masks the green color of all the chlorophyll-bearing parts, leaves, stems and young fruit, so that they remain a dramatic purple-to-reddish-brown throughout the life of the plant. Plants with the dark leaves can be found growing next to those with green leaves, so there is most likely only a single gene controlling the production of the pigment in some varieties. The stems and the spherical, spiny seed capsules also vary in pigmentation. The fruit capsules of some varieties are more showy than the flowers.\nThe flowers lack petals and are unisexual (male and female) where both types are borne on the same plant (monoecious) in terminal panicle-like inflorescences of green or, in some varieties, shades of red. The male flowers are numerous, yellowish-green with prominent creamy stamens; the female flowers, borne at the tips of the spikes, lie within the immature spiny capsules, are relatively few in number and have prominent red stigmas.\nThe fruit is a spiny, greenish (to reddish-purple) capsule containing large, oval, shiny, bean-like, highly poisonous seeds with variable brownish mottling. Castor seeds have a warty appendage called the caruncle, which is a type of elaiosome. The caruncle promotes the dispersal of the seed by ants (myrmecochory).\nIt reproduces with a mixed pollination system which favors selfing by geitonogamy but at the same time can be an out-crosser by anemophily (wind pollination) or entomophily (insect pollination).\nChemistry.\nThree terpenoids and a tocopherol-related compound have been found in the aerial parts of \"Ricinus\". Compounds named (3\"E\",7\"Z\",11\"E\")-19-hydroxycasba-3,7,11-trien-5-one, 6\u03b1-hydroxy-10\u03b2-methoxy-7\u03b1,8\u03b1-epoxy-5-oxocasbane-20,10-olide, 15\u03b1-hydroxylup-20(29)-en-3-one, and (2\"R\",4a\"R\",8a\"R\")-3,4,4a,8a-tetrahydro-4a-hydroxy-2,6,7,8a-tetramethyl-2-(4,8, 12-trimethyltridecyl)-2\"H\"-chromene-5,8-dione were isolated from the methanol extracts of \"Ricinus communis\" by chromatographic methods.\nPartitioned h-hexane fraction of \"Ricinus\" root methanol extract resulted in enrichment of two triterpenes: lupeol and urs-6-ene-3,16-dione (erandone). Crude methanolic extract, enriched n-hexane fraction and isolates at doses 100\u00a0mg/kg p.o. exhibited significant (P &lt; 0.001) anti-inflammatory activity in carrageenan-induced hind paw oedema model.\nTaxonomy.\nThe evolution of castor and its relation to other species are currently being studied using modern genetic tools.\nThe plant known as \"false castor oil plant\", \"Fatsia japonica\", is not closely related.\nEtymology.\nCarl Linnaeus used the name \"Ricinus\" because it is a Latin word for tick; the seed is named so because of its bump at the tip as well as the markings borne that resemble certain ticks. The genus \"Ricinus\" also exists in zoology, and designates insects (not ticks) which are parasites of birds; this is possible because the names of animals and plants are governed by different nomenclature codes.\nThe common name \"castor oil\" probably comes from its use as a replacement for castoreum, a perfume base made from the dried perineal glands of the beaver (\"castor\" in Latin). It has another common name, palm of Christ, or \"Palma Christi\", that derives from castor oil's reputed ability to heal wounds and cure ailments.\nDistribution and habitat.\nAlthough \"R. communis\" is indigenous to the southeastern Mediterranean Basin, Eastern Africa, and India, today it is widespread throughout tropical regions. In areas with a suitable climate, castor establishes itself easily where it can become an invasive plant and can often be found on wasteland.\nEcology.\n\"Ricinus communis\" is the host plant of the common castor butterfly (\"Ariadne merione\"), the eri silkmoth (\"Samia cynthia ricini\"), and the castor semi-looper moth (\"Achaea janata\"). It is also used as a food plant by the larvae of some other species of Lepidoptera, including \"Hypercompe hambletoni\" and the nutmeg (\"Discestra trifolii\"). A jumping spider \"Evarcha culicivora\" has an association with \"R. communis\". They consume the nectar for food and preferentially use these plants as a location for courtship.\nEach castor seed has a yellow nodule full of fats one end of the seed that are nutritious for young ants. After hauling their harvest into their nests and pulling off the delicious part, ants discard the rest of the seed into their trash pile, where the future plant starts to grow.\nCultivation.\nIt is also used extensively as a decorative plant in parks and other public areas, particularly as a \"dot plant\" in traditional bedding schemes. If sown early, under glass, and kept at a temperature of around until planted out, the castor oil plant can reach a height of in a year. In areas prone to frost it is usually shorter, and grown as if it were an annual. However, it can grow well outdoors in cooler climates, at least in southern England, and the leaves do not appear to suffer frost damage in sheltered spots, where it remains evergreen. It was used in Edwardian times in the parks of Toronto, Canada. Although not cultivated there, the plant grows wild in the US, notably Griffith Park in Los Angeles. \nCultivars.\nCultivars have been developed by breeders for use as ornamental plants (heights refer to plants grown as annuals) and for commercial production of castor oil.\nAllergenicity and toxicity.\n\"Ricinus\" is extremely allergenic, and has an OPALS allergy scale rating of 10 out of 10. The plant is also a very strong trigger for asthma, and allergies to \"Ricinus\" are commonplace and severe.\nThe castor oil plant produces abundant amounts of very light pollen, which easily become airborne and can be inhaled into the lungs, triggering allergic reactions. The sap of the plant causes skin rashes. People who are allergic to the plant can also develop rashes from touching the leaves, flowers, or seeds. They can also have cross-allergic reactions to latex sap from the related \"Hevea brasiliensis\" plant.\nThe toxicity of raw castor beans is due to the presence of ricin. Although the lethal dose in adults is considered to be four to eight seeds, reports of actual poisoning are relatively rare. According to the \"Guinness World Records\", this is the world's most poisonous common plant. Ricin is also present in lower concentrations throughout the plant.\nIf ricin is ingested, symptoms commonly begin within two to four hours, but may be delayed by up to 36 hours. These include a burning sensation in mouth and throat, abdominal pain, purging and bloody diarrhea. Within several days there is severe dehydration, a drop in blood pressure and a decrease in urine. Unless treated, death can be expected to occur within 3\u20135 days; however, in most cases a full recovery can be made.\nPoisoning occurs when animals, including humans, ingest broken castor beans or break the seed by chewing: intact seeds may pass through the digestive tract without releasing the toxin. The toxin provides the castor oil plant with some degree of natural protection from insect pests such as aphids. Ricin has been investigated for its potential use as an insecticide.\nCommercially available cold-pressed castor oil is not toxic to humans in normal doses, whether internal or external.\nUses.\nGlobal castor seed production is around two million tons per year. Leading producing areas are India (with over three-quarters of the global yield), China and Mozambique, and it is widely grown as a crop in Ethiopia. There are several active breeding programmes.\nOther modern uses of natural, blended, or chemically altered castor products include:\nHistorical uses.\nAncient uses.\nCastor seeds have been found in Egyptian tombs dating back to 4000 BC; the slow-burning oil was mostly used to fuel lamps. Herodotus and other Greek travellers noted the use of castor seed oil for lighting, body ointments, and improving hair growth and texture. Cleopatra is reputed to have used it to brighten the whites of her eyes. The Ebers Papyrus is an ancient Egyptian medical treatise believed to date from 1552 BC. Translated in 1872, it describes castor oil as a laxative.\nThe use of castor bean oil (\"eranda\") in India has been documented since 2000 BC in lamps and in local medicine as a laxative, purgative, and cathartic in Unani, Ayurvedic, siddha and other ethnomedical systems. Traditional Ayurvedic and siddha medicine considers castor oil the king of medicinals for curing arthritic diseases. It is regularly given to children to treat infections with parasitic worms.\nThe ancient Romans had a variety of medicinal/cosmetic uses for both the seeds and the leaves of \"Ricinus communis\". The naturalist Pliny the Elder cited the poisonous qualities of the seeds, but mentioned that they could be used to form wicks for oil lamps (possibly if crushed together), and the oil for use as a laxative and lamp oil. He also recommends the use of the leaves as follows:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The leaves are applied topically with vinegar for erysipelas, and fresh-gathered, they are used by themselves for diseases of the mamill\u00e6 [breasts] and de- fluxions; a decoction of them in wine, with polenta and saffron, is good for inflammations of various kinds. Boiled by themselves, and applied to the face for three successive days, they improve the complexion.\nIn Haiti it is called \"maskreti\", where the plant is turned into a red oil that is then given to newborns as a purgative to cleanse the insides of their first stools.\nCastor seed and its oil have also been used in China for centuries, mainly prescribed in local medicine for internal use or use in dressings.\nUses in torture.\nCastor oil was used as an instrument of coercion by the paramilitary Blackshirts under the regime of Italian dictator Benito Mussolini and by the Spanish Civil Guard in Francoist Spain. Dissidents and regime opponents were forced to ingest the oil in large amounts, triggering severe diarrhea and dehydration, which could ultimately cause death. This punishment method was originally thought of by Gabriele D'Annunzio, the Italian poet and Fascist supporter, during the First World War.\nOther uses.\nExtract of \"Ricinus communis\" exhibited acaricidal and insecticidal activities against the adult of \"Haemaphysalis bispinosa\" (Acarina: Ixodidae) and hematophagous fly \"Hippobosca maculata\" (Diptera: Hippoboscidae).\nMembers of the Bodo tribe of Bodoland in Assam, India, use the leaves of the plant to feed the larvae of muga and endi silkworms.\nCastor oil is an effective motor lubricant and has been used in internal combustion engines, including those of World War I airplanes, some racing cars and some model airplanes. It has historically been popular for lubricating two-stroke engines due to high resistance to heat compared to petroleum-based oils. It does not mix well with petroleum products, particularly at low temperatures, but mixes better with the methanol-based fuels used in glow model engines. In total-loss-lubrication applications, it tends to leave carbon deposits and varnish within the engine. It has been largely replaced by synthetic oils that are more stable and less toxic.\nJewellery can be made of castor beans, particularly necklaces and bracelets. Holes must not be drilled into the castor beans as the shell protects the wearer from the ricin. Any chips in the shell can cause poisoning of the wearer. Pets who chew the jewellery can become ill.\n\"Ricinus communis\" leaves are used in botanical printing (also known as ecoprinting) in Asia. When bundled with cotton or silk fabric and steamed, the leaves can produce a green-colored imprint.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is usually known as the ' or simply as '. A cube, La Grande Arche is part of the perspective from the Louvre to Arc de Triomphe, and was one of the Grands Projets of Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand. The distance from La Grande Arche to Arc de Triomphe is .\nDesign and construction.\nA great national design competition was launched in 1982 as the initiative of French president Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand. Danish architect Johan Otto von Spreckelsen (1929\u20131987) and Danish engineer Erik Reitzel (1941\u20132012) designed the winning entry to be a late-20th-century version of the Arc de Triomphe: a monument to humanity and humanitarian ideals rather than military victories. The construction of the monument began in 1985, with most of the work being carried out by French civil engineering company Bouygues. Spreckelsen resigned in July 1986 and ratified the transfer of all his architectural responsibilities to his associate, French architect Paul Andreu. Reitzel continued his work until the monument was completed in 1989. The Grande Arche is in the approximate shape of a cube with a width, height, and depth of ; it has been suggested that the structure looks like a hypercube (a tesseract) projected onto the three-dimensional world. It has a prestressed concrete frame covered with glass and is covered in Bethel Granite.\n' was inaugurated in July 1989, with grand military parades that marked the bicentennial of the French Revolution. It completed the line of monuments that forms the running through Paris. The Grande Arche is turned at an angle of 6.33\u00b0 about the vertical axis. The most important reason for this turn was technical: with a Paris M\u00e9tro station, an RER station, and a motorway all situated directly underneath the \"Arche\", the angle was the only way to accommodate the structure's giant foundations. In addition, from an architectural point of view, the turn emphasises the depth of the monument and is similar to the turn of the Louvre at the other end of the . In addition, the ' is placed so that it forms a secondary axis with the two of the highest buildings in Paris at the time, the and the .\nThe two sides of the \"Arche\" house government offices.

It features panoramic views of Paris and includes a restaurant and an exhibition area dedicated to photojournalism.\nThe void contains skeletal shafts for panoramic lifts and a PTFE-and-fibreglass tensile-membrane sunshade known as the \"Cloud\" (\"\").\nThe Danish architect, von Spreckelsen, chose Italian Carrara marble for the tile cladding of the fa\u00e7ade, for the marble's gleaming, milky white exterior. This caused structural problems, as marble is porous, rainwater got into its pores, and when the temperature froze, the ice in its pores cracked the marble, and tiles began buckling and falling down, luckily without, however, hitting, injuring or killing anyone. The monument had to be closed for a few years while French engineers (von Spreckelsen had retired from the project before it was completed and was dead by the time of the collapsing tiles) had the marble tiles removed and replaced with granite quarried in Vermont, which has proved durable, at a cost of some \u20ac200M.\nTenants.\nOrganisations headquartered in the Grande Arche include the Bureau d'Enqu\u00eates sur les \u00c9v\u00e9nements de Mer (BEAmer), the French marine accident investigation agency; and the French Land Transport Accident Investigation Bureau, in the southern portion.\nCultural representations.\nIn 2016 Laurence Coss\u00e9 published in a novelistic form an account of Sprekelsen's work.

{"id": "75482", "revid": "50689906", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=75482", "title": "Wild Hunt", "text": "Germanic folkloric motif\nThe Wild Hunt is a folklore motif occurring across various northern, western and eastern European societies, appearing in the religions of the Germans, Celts, and Slavs (motif E501 per Thompson). Wild Hunts typically involve a chase led by a mythological figure escorted by a ghostly or supernatural group of hunters engaged in pursuit. The leader of the hunt is often a named figure associated with Odin in Germanic legends, but may variously be a historical or legendary figure like Theodoric the Great, the Danish king , the dragon slayer Sigurd, the psychopomp of Welsh mythology , biblical figures such as Herod, Cain, Gabriel, or the Devil, or an unidentified lost soul. The hunters are generally the souls of the dead or ghostly dogs, sometimes fairies, valkyries, or elves.\nSeeing the Wild Hunt was thought to forebode some catastrophe such as war or plague, or at best the death of the one who witnessed it. People encountering the Hunt might also be abducted to the underworld or the fairy kingdom. In some instances, it was also believed that people's spirits could be pulled away during their sleep to join the cavalcade.\nThe concept was developed by Jacob Grimm in his (1835) on the basis of comparative mythology. Grimm believed that a group of stories represented a folkloristic survival of Germanic paganism, but this is disputed by other, modern scholars who claim that comparable folk myths are found throughout Northern Europe, Western Europe, and Central Europe. Lotte Motz noted, however, that the motif abounds \"above all in areas of Germanic speech.\" Grimm popularised the term ('Wild Hunt') for the phenomenon.\nComparative evidence and terminology.\nGermanic tradition.\nBased on the comparative study of the German folklore, the phenomenon is often referred to as (German: 'Wild Hunt/chase') or ('Raging Host/army'). The term 'Hunt' was more common in northern Germany and 'Host' was more used in Southern Germany; with however no clear dividing line since parts of southern Germany know the 'Hunt', and parts of the north know the 'Host'. It was also known in Germany as the ('Wild Army'), its leader was given various identities, including Wodan (or \"Woden\"), Knecht Ruprecht (compare Krampus), Berchtold (or Berchta), and Holda (or \"Holle\"). The Wild Hunt is also known from post-medieval folklore.\nIn England, it was known as (Old English: 'Herla's assembly'), \"Woden's Hunt\", \"Herod's Hunt\", \"Cain's Hunt\", the \"Devil's Dandy Dogs\" (in Cornwall), \"Gabriel's Hounds\" (in northern England), and \"\" (in North America).\nIn Scandinavia, the Wild Hunt is known as (commonly interpreted as 'The Asgard Ride'), and as ('Odin's Hunters'). The names ('Asgard Ride' as attested in parts of Tr\u00f8ndelag), and (Swedish: 'the hunt of Odin' and 'wild hunt') are also attested. At the very front of Oskoreia rides Guro Rysserova ('Gudrun Horsetail'), often called \"Guro \u00c5sgard\", who is \"big and horrid, her horse black and called Skokse (...)\"\nThere is disagreement about the etymology of the word . The first element has several proposed sources: \"\u00c5sg\u00e5rd\" ('Asgard'), \"oska\" ('thunder'), or Old Norse \"\u01ebskurligr\" ('dreadful'). The hypothetical \"\u00c1sgo\u00f0rei\u00f0\" ('\u00c6sir God Ride') was also once proposed. Only the second element, ('ride') from Old Norse , is uncontroversial. The word was popularly perceived to be connected to Asgard, as seen in the folk ballad of Sigurd Svein, who is taken to Asgard by Oskoreia and Guro Rysserova.\nIn the Netherlands and Flanders (in northern Belgium), the Wild Hunt is known as the Buckriders (Dutch: Bokkenrijders) and was used by gangs of highwaymen for their advantage in the 18th century.\nEurope.\nIn Welsh folklore, was depicted as a wild huntsman riding a demon horse who hunts souls at night along with a pack of white-bodied and red-eared \"dogs of hell\". In Arthurian legends, he is the king of the underworld who makes sure that the imprisoned devils do not destroy human souls. A comparable Welsh folk myth is known as (Welsh: \"hounds of Annwn\").\nIn France, the \"Host\" was known in Latin sources as and in Old French as (the \"household or retinue of Hellequin\"). The Old French name was probably borrowed from Middle English (Old English ) by the Romance-speaking Norman invaders of Britain. Other similar figures appear in the French folklore, such as , a hunter who chased with dogs in the forest of Fontainebleau, and a Poitou tradition where a hunter who has faulted by hunting on Sunday is condemned to redeem himself by hunting during the night, along with its French Canadian version the .\nAmong West Slavs, it is known as or (Czech: \"wild hunt\", \"baiting\"), \"dz\u00ebw\u00f4/dz\u00ebk\u00f4 jachta\" (Kashubian: \"wild hunt\"), \"Dziki Gon\" or (Polish). It is also known among the Sorbs and among the South Slavic Slovenes (Slovene: \"the wild hunting party\" or \"wild hunt\"). However, scholars of Slavic folklore have noted it is a motif of foreign, specifically German(ic), origin. In Belarusian, it is called \u0414\u0437i\u043a\u0430\u0435 \u041f\u0430\u043b\u044f\u0432\u0430\u043d\u043d\u0435 (Belarusian: \"wild hunt\"). As Belarus used to be part of Poland, the motif's presence likely came from there as an intermediary.\nIn Italy, it is called (\"Dead Hunt\"), (\"infernal hunt\") or (\"Wild Hunt\")\nIn Spain this myth is documented at least since the 13th century, under the name (\"Old army\"), today . In Galician is known as (from \"the old army\"), and (\"troop, company\"); in Asturias; (\"troop of ghosts\") in Le\u00f3n; and (\"war company\") or (\"deadly retinue\") in Extremadura.\nHistoriography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n\"Another class of specters will prove more fruitful for our investigation: they, like the ignes fatui, include \"unchristened babes\", but instead of straggling singly on the earth as fires, they sweep through forest and air in \"whole companies\" with a horrible din. This is the widely spread legend of the \"furious host\", the \"furious hunt\", which is of high antiquity, and interweaves itself, now with gods, and now with heroes. Look where you will, it betrays its connexion with heathenism.\"\n\u2014 Folklorist Jacob Grimm.\nThe concept of the Wild Hunt was first documented by the German folklorist Jacob Grimm who first published it in his 1835 book \"Deutsche Mythologie\". It was in this work that he popularized the term \"Wilde Jagd\" (\"Wild Hunt\") for the phenomenon. Grimm's methodological approach was rooted in the idea, common in nineteenth-century Europe, that modern folklore represented a fossilized survival of the beliefs of the distant past. In developing his idea of the Wild Hunt, he mixed together recent folkloric sources with textual evidence dating to the medieval and early modern periods. This approach came to be criticized within the field of folkloristics during the 20th century as more emphasis was placed on the \"dynamic and evolving nature of folklore\".\nGrimm interpreted the Wild Hunt phenomenon as having pre-Christian origins, arguing that the male figure who appeared in it was a survival of folk beliefs about the god Wodan who had \"lost his sociable character, his near familiar features, and assumed the aspect of a dark and dreadful power... a specter and a devil.\" Grimm believed that this male figure was sometimes replaced by a female counterpart, whom he referred to as Holda and Berchta. In his words, \"not only Wuotan and other gods, but heathen goddesses too, may head the furious host: the wild hunter passes into the wood-wife, W\u00f4den into \"Frau Gaude\".\" He added his opinion that this female figure was Woden's wife.\nDiscussing martial elements of the Wild Hunt, Grimm commented that \"it marches as an army, it portends the outbreak of war.\" He added that a number of figures that had been recorded as leading the hunt, such as \"\"Wuotan, Huckelbernd, Berholt,\" bestriding their \"white war-horse\", armed and spurred, appear still as \"supreme directors of the war\" for which they, so to speak, give license to mankind.\"\nGrimm believed that in pre-Christian Europe, the hunt, led by a god and a goddess, either visited \"the land at some holy tide, bringing welfare and blessing, accepting gifts and offerings of the people\" or they alternately float \"unseen through the air, perceptible in cloudy shapes, in the roar and howl of the winds, carrying on \"war\", \"hunting\" or the game of \"ninepins\", the chief employments of ancient heroes: an array which, less tied down to a definite time, explains more the natural phenomenon.\" He believed that under the influence of Christianisation, the story was converted from being that of a \"solemn march of gods\" to being \"a pack of horrid spectres, dashed with dark and devilish ingredients\". A little earlier, in 1823, Felicia Hemans records this legend in her poem \"The Wild Huntsman\", linking it here specifically to the castles of Rodenstein and Schnellerts and to the Odenwald.\nIn the influential book \"Kultische Geheimb\u00fcnde der Germanen\" (1934), Otto H\u00f6fler argued that the German motifs of the \"Wild Hunt\" should be interpreted as the spectral troops led by the god Wuotan which had a ritualistic counterpart in the living bands of ecstatic warriors (Old Norse \"berserkir\"), allegedly in a cultic union with the dead warriors of the past.\nHans Peter Duerr (1985) noted that for modern readers, it \"is generally difficult to decide, on the basis of the sources, whether what is involved in the reports about the appearance of the Wild Hunt is merely a demonic \"interpretation\" of natural phenomenon, or whether we are dealing with a description of ritual processions of humans changed into demons.\" Historian Ronald Hutton noted that there was \"a powerful and well-established international scholarly tradition\" which argued that the medieval Wild Hunt legends were an influence on the development of the early modern ideas of the Witches' Sabbath. Hutton nevertheless believed that this approach could be \"fundamentally challenged\".\nLotte Motz noted that the motif is found \"above all in areas of Germanic speech.\" While found in areas once settled by Celts, these legends are told less frequently and they are not encountered in the Mediterranean regions, \"at least not easily\".\nAttestations.\nGermany.\nAn abundance of different tales of the Wild Hunt has been recorded in Germany. The leader, often called \"der Schimmelreiter\", is generally identified with the god Wotan, but sometimes with a feminine figure: the wife of Wotan, Holda ('the friendly one'; also Holle or Holt), Fru Waur, or Fru Gode in Northern Germany; or Perchta (the bright one; also Berchta, Berhta or Berta) in Southern Germany. The leader also is sometimes an undead noble, most often called Count Hackelberg or Count Ebernburg, who is cursed to hunt eternally because of misbehaviour during his lifetime, and in some versions died from injuries of a slain boar's tusk.\nDogs and wolves were generally involved. In some areas, werewolves were depicted as stealing beer and sometimes food in houses. Horses were portrayed as two-, three-, six-, and eight-legged, often with fiery eyes. In the 'Host' variants, principally found in southern Germany, a man went out in front, warning people to get out of the streets before the coming of the Host's armed men, who were sometimes depicted as doing battle with one another. A feature peculiar to the 'Hunt' version, generally encountered in northern Germany, was the pursuit and capture of one or more female demons, or a hart in some versions, while some others did not have prey at all.\nSometimes, the tales associate the hunter with a dragon or the devil. The lone hunter (\"der Wilde J\u00e4ger\") is most often riding a horse, seldom a horse-drawn carriage, and usually has several hounds in his company. If the prey is mentioned, it is most often a young woman, either guilty or innocent. Gottfried August B\u00fcrger's ballad \"Der wilde J\u00e4ger\" describes the fate of a nobleman who dares to hunt on the Sabbath and finds both a curse and a pack of demons deep in the woods. He might also have asked God to let him hunt until Judgement Day, as has \"ewiger J\u00e4ger\" (the eternal hunter).\nThe majority of the tales deal with some person encountering the Wild Hunt. If this person stands up against the hunters, he will be punished. If he helps the hunt, he will be awarded money, gold, or, most often, a leg of a slain animal or human, which is often cursed in a way that makes it impossible to be rid of it. In this case, the person has to find a priest or magician able to ban it or trick the Wild Hunt into taking the leg back by asking for salt, which the hunt can not deliver. In many versions, a person staying right in the middle of the road during the encounter is safe.\nScandinavia.\nIn Scandinavia, the leader of the hunt was Odin and the event was referred to as \"Odens jakt\" (\"Odin's hunt\") and \"Oskoreia\" (from \"Asg\u00e5rdsreien\" \u2013 \"the Asgard Ride\"). Odin's hunt was heard but rarely seen, and a typical trait is that one of Odin's dogs was barking louder and a second one fainter. Besides one or two shots, these barks were the only sounds that were clearly identified. When Odin's hunt was heard, it meant changing weather in many regions, but it could also mean war and unrest. According to some reports, the forest turned silent and only a whining sound and dog barks could be heard.\nIn western Sweden and sometimes in the east as well, it has been said that Odin was a nobleman or even a king who had hunted on Sundays and therefore was doomed to hunt down and kill supernatural beings until the end of time. According to certain accounts, Odin does not ride, but travels in a wheeled vehicle, specifically a one-wheeled cart.\nIn parts of Sm\u00e5land, it appears that people believed that Odin hunted with large birds when the dogs got tired. When it was needed, he could transform a bevy of sparrows into an armed host.\nIf houses were built on former roads, they could be burnt down, because Odin did not change his plans if he had formerly travelled on a road there. Not even charcoal kilns could be built on disused roads, because if Odin was hunting the kiln would be ablaze.\nOne tradition maintains that Odin did not travel further up than an ox wears his yoke, so if Odin was hunting, it was safest to throw oneself onto the ground in order to avoid being hit, a pourquoi story that evolved as an explanation for the popular belief that persons lying at ground level are safer from lightning strikes than are persons who are standing. In \u00c4lghult in Sm\u00e5land, it was safest to carry a piece of bread and a piece of steel when going to church and back during Yule. The reason was that if one met the rider with the broad-rimmed hat, one should throw the piece of steel in front of oneself, but if one met his dogs first, one should throw the pieces of bread instead.\nBritain.\nIn the \"Peterborough Chronicle\", there is an account of the Wild Hunt's appearance at night, beginning with the appointment of a disastrous abbot for the monastery, Henry d'Angely, in 1127:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReliable witnesses were said to have given the number of huntsmen as twenty or thirty, and it is said, in effect, that this went on for nine weeks, ending at Easter. Orderic Vitalis (1075\u2013c. 1142), an English monk cloistered at St Evroul-en-Ouche, in Normandy, reported a similar cavalcade seen in January 1091, which he said were \"Herlechin's troop\" (\"familia Herlechini\"; cf. Harlequin).\nWhile these earlier reports of Wild Hunts were recorded by clerics and portrayed as diabolic, in late medieval romances, such as \"Sir Orfeo\", the hunters are rather from a faery otherworld, where the Wild Hunt was the hosting of the fairies; its leaders also varied, but they included Gwydion, Gwynn ap Nudd, King Arthur, Nuada, King Herla, Woden, the Devil and Herne the Hunter. Many legends are told of their origins, as in that of \"Dando and his dogs\" or \"the dandy dogs\": Dando, wanting a drink but having exhausted what his huntsmen carried, declared he would go to hell for it. A stranger came and offered a drink, only to steal Dando's game and then Dando himself, with his dogs giving chase. The sight was long claimed to have been seen in the area. Another legend recounted how King Herla, having visited the Fairy King, was warned not to step down from his horse until the greyhound he carried jumped down; he found that three centuries had passed during his visit, and those of his men who dismounted crumbled to dust; he and his men are still riding, because the greyhound has yet to jump down.\nThe myth of the Wild Hunt has through the ages been modified to accommodate other gods and folk heroes, among them King Arthur and, more recently, in a Dartmoor folk legend, Sir Francis Drake. At Cadbury Castle in Somerset, an old lane near the castle was called King Arthur's Lane and even in the 19th century, the idea survived that on wild winter nights the king and his hounds could be heard rushing along with it.\nIn certain parts of Britain, the hunt is said to be that of hell-hounds chasing sinners or the unbaptized. In Devon these are known as Yeth (Heath) or Wisht Hounds, in Cornwall Dando and his Dogs or the Devil and his Dandy Dogs, in Wales the Cwn Annwn, the Hounds of Hell, and in Somerset as Gabriel Ratchets or Retchets (dogs). In Devon the hunt is particularly associated with Wistman's Wood.\nIberia.\nThe \"Santa Compa\u00f1a\" (known also in Galician as: \"Rolda\", \"As da nuite\", \"Pantalla\", \"Avis\u00f3ns\" or \"Pantaruxada\"; in Asturian as \"G\u00fcestia\", \"G\u00fceste\", \"G\u00fcestida\" or \"G\u00fc\u00e9stiga\"; in Spanish as \"Estantigua\") is a mythical belief in Northwestern Spain and northern Portugal which consists in a procession of ghosts or souls. The procession is led by a living person (usually a parishioner of a particular church) carrying a cross or a cauldron of holy water (sometimes they carry both), followed by several of the souls of the dead holding lit candles.\nBalkans.\nThe South Slavic folklore of the Balkans features a supernatural procession of horsemen known as the Todorci that occurs on the first week of the Great Lent (known as the Todor or St. Theodore Week) and attacks the people who consume or cook meat and dairy products. Sometimes these horsemen are instead depicted as monstrous centauric creatures whose torsos grow out of the horses' backs, not too dissimilarly to the traditional depiction of the Nuckelavee. The horseshoe-shaped wounds inflicted by the hooves of their steeds don't heal naturally; instead, the victim must visit the site of the attack one year later, where the wounds will either magically heal instantaneously if he's been living piously for the previous year, or kill him if he's been living sinfully. They can be defended against with garlic or an improvised cross made from forks or knives.\nIn Serbia, stories involving the Todorci are generally concentrated in the north-west of the country. They're traditionally depicted as a procession of horsemen whose steeds lack tails. They usually appear on the night between Monday and Tuesday of the Todor Week. They're led by an elder man called Great Todor wearing a white cloak and riding a lame white horse. Certain versions of the story claim that he is St. Theodore himself.\nInterpretations.\nAccording to scholar Susan Greenwood, the Wild Hunt \"primarily concerns an initiation into the wild, untamed forces of nature in its dark and chthonic aspects.\"\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Metamorphoses, cavalcades, ecstasies, followed by the egress of the soul in the shape of an animal\u2014these are different paths to a single goal. Between animals and souls, animals and the dead, animals and the beyond, there exists a profound connection.\u2014\u200a\nModern influence.\nOn Santa Claus.\nThe role of Wotan's Wild Hunt during the Yuletide period has been theorized to have influenced the development of the Dutch Christmas figure Sinterklaas, and by extension his American counterpart Santa Claus, in a variety of facets. These include his long white beard and his gray horse for nightly rides.\nIn modern paganism.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n\"As far as practitioners of nature spiritualities are concerned, the Wild Hunt offers an initiation into the wild and an opening up of the senses; a sense of dissolution of self in confrontation with fear and death, an exposure to a 'whirlwind pulse that runs through life'. In short, engagement with the Hunt is a bid to restore a reciprocity and harmony between humans and nature.\"\n\u2014 Susan Greenwood.\nVarious practitioners of the contemporary pagan religion of Wicca have drawn upon folklore involving the Wild Hunt to inspire their own rites. In their context, the leader of the Wild Hunt is the goddess Hecate. The anthropologist Susan Greenwood provided an account of one such Wild Hunt ritual performed by a modern Pagan group in Norfolk during the late 1990s, stating that they used this mythology \"as a means of confronting the dark of nature as a process of initiation.\" Referred to as the \"Wild Hunt Challenge\" by those running it, it took place on Halloween and involved participants walking around a local area of woodland in the daytime, and then repeating that task as a timed competition at night, \"to gain mastery over an area of Gwyn ap Nudd's hunting ground\". If completed successfully, it was held that the participant had gained the trust of the wood's spirits, and they would be permitted to cut timber from its trees with which to make a staff. The anthropologist Rachel Morgain reported a \"ritual recreation\" of the Wild Hunt among the Reclaiming tradition of Wicca in San Francisco.\nIn popular culture.\nThe \"\u00c5sg\u00e5rdsreien\", Peter Nicolai Arbo's 1872 oil painting, depicts the Scandinavian version of the Wild Hunt, with Thor leading the hunting party. This painting is featured on the cover of Bathory's 1988 album, \"Blood Fire Death\".\nMusic.\nThe Wild Hunt is the subject of Transcendental \u00c9tude No. 8 in C minor, \"Wilde Jagd\" (Wild Hunt) by Franz Liszt, and appears in Karl Maria von Weber's 1821 opera \"Der Freisch\u00fctz\" and in Arnold Schoenberg's oratorio \"Gurre-Lieder\" of 1911. C\u00e9sar Franck's orchestral tone poem \"Le Chasseur maudit\" (\"The Accursed Huntsman\") is based on Gottfried August B\u00fcrger's ballad \"Der wilde J\u00e4ger\".\nIn act 1 of Richard Wagner's 1870 opera \"Die Walk\u00fcre\", Siegmund relates that he has been pursued by \u201cDas w\u00fctende Heer\u201d, which is an indication to the audience that it is Wotan himself who has called up the storm which has driven him (Siegmund) to Hunding's dwelling.\nThe subject of Stan Jones' American country song \"\" of 1948, which tells of cowboys chasing the Devil's cattle through the night sky, resembles the European myth.\nSwedish folk musician The Tallest Man on Earth released an album in 2010 entitled \"The Wild Hunt\", and in 2013 the black metal band Watain, also Swedish, released an album with the same title. German folk band Versengold released the song \"Die wilde Jagt\" in 2021, as the first single from their 2022 album \"Was kost die Welt\". English doom metal band, Green Lung, have a song called \u201cHunters in the Sky\u201don their 2023 album This Heathen Land.\nComics.\nThe Wild Hunt appears in Marvel Comics, primarily the \"Thor\" series, and is led by Malekith the Accursed, the Dark Elf King of Svartalfheim and one of Thor's archenemies.\nIn Mike Mignola's comic book series Hellboy, two versions of the Wild Hunt myth are present. In ', the hero receives an invitation from British noblemen to partake in a giant hunting called \"The Wild Hunt\", after the legend of \"Herne, god of the Hunt\". In ', Hellboy encounters \"King Vold, the flying huntsman\" whose figure is based on the Norwegian folktale of \"The Flying Huntsman (headless King Volmer and his hounds)\" according to Mignola.\nThe Wild Hunt was adapted for the Grace Note portion of \"The Case Files of Lord El-Melloi II\" anime adaptation with the 4th and 5th episodes where Lord El-Melloi II (voiced by Daisuke Namikawa) helps a fellow magus teacher by the name of Wills Pelham Codrington (voiced by Tomoaki Maeno) in a case involving his father's home where the leylines have become unstable. It is there they encounter Black Dogs, the incarnation of lightning who have been killing people in the vicinity. With the help of his allies, Wills, and a fairy they encounter names Faye, Lord El-Melloi II manages to solve the case and avert the threat.\nFilm and television.\nEpisode 5 of the BBC series shown in 1958/9, Quatermass and the Pit, written by Nigel Neale, was entitled \"The Wild Hunt\" and made frequent mention of the myths described here.\n\"The Wild Hunt\" is a Canadian horror drama film of 2009 by director Alexandre Franchi.\nThe MTV series \"Teen Wolf\" features the Wild Hunt as the main villains of the first half of season 6.
