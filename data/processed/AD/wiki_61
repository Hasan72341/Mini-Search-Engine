He started his career with trumpeter Donald Byrd's group. Hancock soon joined the Miles Davis Quintet, where he helped to redefine the role of a jazz rhythm section and was one of the primary architects of the post-bop sound. In the 1970s, he experimented with jazz fusion, funk, and electro styles using a wide array of synthesizers and electronics. It was during this time that he released one of his best-known and most influential albums, \"Head Hunters\".\nHancock's best-known compositions include \"Cantaloupe Island\", \"Watermelon Man\", \"Maiden Voyage\", and \"Chameleon\", all of which are jazz standards. During the 1980s, he had a hit single with the electronic instrumental \"Rockit\", a collaboration with bassist/producer Bill Laswell. Hancock has won an Academy Award and 14 Grammy Awards, including Album of the Year for his 2007 album \"\", a tribute to his friend Joni Mitchell. In 2024, Neil McCormick of \"The Daily Telegraph\" ranked Hancock as the greatest keyboard player of all time. In 2025, he received the Polar Music Prize.\nSince 2012, Hancock has served as a professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, where he teaches at the UCLA Herb Alpert School of Music. He is also the chairman of the Herbie Hancock Institute of Jazz (known as the Thelonious Monk Institute of Jazz until 2019).\nEarly life.\nHancock was born in Chicago, Illinois, the son of Winnie Belle (n\u00e9e Griffin), a secretary, and Wayman Edward Hancock, a meat inspector for the government. His parents named him after the singer and actor Herb Jeffries. Hancock attended Hyde Park High School in Chicago. Like many jazz pianists, Herbie began with a classical education. He started playing piano when he was seven years old, and his talent was recognized when he was young. Considered to be a child prodigy, he played the first movement of Mozart's Piano Concerto No. 26 in D Major, K. 537 \"(Coronation)\" at a young people's concert on February 5, 1952, with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra (led by CSO assistant conductor George Schick) at the age of 11.\nThroughout his teens, Herbie Hancock never had a jazz teacher; he developed his ear and sense of harmony by listening to the records of jazz pianists including George Shearing, Erroll Garner, Bill Evans, and Oscar Peterson. Hancock was also influenced by records of the vocal group the Hi-Lo's. In his words:\nBy the time I actually heard the Hi-Lo's, I started picking that stuff out; my ear was happening. I could hear stuff and that's when I really learned some much farther-out voicings \u2013 like the harmonies I used on \"Speak Like a Child\" \u2013 just being able to do that. I really got that from Clare Fischer's arrangements for the Hi-Lo's. Clare Fischer was a major influence on my harmonic concept... he and Bill Evans, and Ravel and Gil Evans, finally. You know, that's where it came from.\nIn 1960, Hancock heard Chris Anderson play just once and begged him to accept him as a student. Hancock often mentions Anderson as his harmonic guru.\nHancock graduated from Grinnell College in Grinnell, Iowa, in 1960, with degrees in electrical engineering and music. Hancock then moved back to Chicago, and began working with Donald Byrd and Coleman Hawkins. During this time, he also took courses at Roosevelt University. Grinnell also awarded him an honorary Doctor of Fine Arts degree in 1972. Byrd was attending the Manhattan School of Music in New York at the time and suggested that Hancock study composition with Vittorio Giannini (which he did for a short time in 1960). The pianist quickly earned a reputation, and played subsequent sessions with Oliver Nelson and Phil Woods. Hancock recorded his first solo album, \"Takin' Off\", for Blue Note Records in 1962. \"Watermelon Man\" (from \"Takin' Off\") was to provide Mongo Santamar\u00eda with a hit single, but more importantly for Hancock, \"Takin' Off\" caught the attention of Miles Davis, who was at that time assembling a new band. Hancock was introduced to Davis by the young drummer Tony Williams, a member of the new band.\nCareer.\nMiles Davis Quintet (1963\u20131968) and Blue Note Records (1962\u20131969).\nHancock received considerable attention when, in May 1963, he joined Davis's Second Great Quintet. Davis personally sought out Hancock, whom he saw as one of the most promising talents in jazz. The rhythm section that Davis organized was young but effective, comprising bassist Ron Carter, 17-year-old drummer Tony Williams, and Hancock on piano. After George Coleman and Sam Rivers each took a turn at the saxophone spot, the quintet gelled with Wayne Shorter on tenor saxophone. This quintet is often regarded as one of the finest jazz ensembles yet.\nWhile in Davis's band, Hancock also found time to record dozens of sessions for the Blue Note label, both under his own name and as a sideman with other musicians such as Wayne Shorter, Williams, Grant Green, Bobby Hutcherson, Rivers, Byrd, Kenny Dorham, Hank Mobley, Lee Morgan, Freddie Hubbard, and Eric Dolphy. Hancock also recorded several lesser known but still critically acclaimed albums with larger ensembles \u2013 \"My Point of View\" (1963), \"Speak Like a Child\" (1968) and \"The Prisoner\" (1969), albums that featured flugelhorn, alto flute and bass trombone in addition to the traditional jazz instrumentation. 1963's \"Inventions and Dimensions\" was an album of almost entirely improvised music, teaming Hancock with bassist Paul Chambers and two Latin percussionists, Willie Bobo and Osvaldo \"Chihuahua\" Martinez.\nDuring that period, Hancock also composed the score to Michelangelo Antonioni's film \"Blowup\" (1966), the first of many film soundtracks he recorded in his career. As well as feature film soundtracks, Hancock recorded a number of musical themes used on American television commercials for such well-known products as Pillsbury's Space Food Sticks, Standard Oil, Tab diet cola, and Virginia Slims cigarettes. Hancock also wrote, arranged and conducted a spy type theme for a series of F. William Free commercials for Silva Thins cigarettes. Hancock liked it so much he wished to record it as a song but the ad agency would not let him. He rewrote the harmony, tempo and tone and recorded the piece as the track \"He Who Lives in Fear\" from his \"The Prisoner\" album of 1969.\nDavis had begun incorporating elements of rock and popular music into his recordings by the end of Hancock's tenure with the band. Despite some initial reluctance, Hancock began doubling on electric keyboards, including the Fender Rhodes electric piano at Davis's insistence. Hancock adapted quickly to the new instruments, which proved to be important in his future artistic endeavors. \nIn the summer of 1968, after being dismissed from Davis' band under the pretext that he had returned late from a honeymoon in Brazil, Hancock formed his own sextet. Despite his departure from the band\u2014which was disbanded soon after\u2014Hancock continued to appear on Davis\u2019 records for the next few years. His appearances included \"In a Silent Way\", \"A Tribute to Jack Johnson,\" and \"On the Corner\".\n\"Fat Albert\" (1969) and Mwandishi era (1971\u20131973).\nHancock left Blue Note in 1969, signing with Warner Bros. Records. In 1969, Hancock composed the soundtrack for Bill Cosby's animated prime-time television special \"Hey, Hey, Hey, It's Fat Albert\". Music from the soundtrack was later included on \"Fat Albert Rotunda\" (1969), an R&amp;B-inspired album with strong jazz overtones. One of the jazzier songs on the record, the moody ballad \"Tell Me a Bedtime Story\", was later re-worked as a more electronic sounding song for the Quincy Jones album \"Sounds...and Stuff Like That!!\" (1978).\nHancock became fascinated with electronic musical instruments. Together with the profound influence of Davis's \"Bitches Brew\" (1970), this fascination culminated in a series of albums in which electronic instruments were coupled with acoustic instruments. Hancock's first ventures into electronic music started with a sextet comprising Hancock, bassist Buster Williams and drummer Billy Hart, and a trio of horn players: Eddie Henderson (trumpet), Julian Priester (trombone), and multireedist Bennie Maupin. Patrick Gleeson was eventually added to the mix to play and program the synthesizers.\nThe sextet, later a septet with the addition of Gleeson, made three albums under Hancock's name: \"Mwandishi\" (1971), \"Crossings\" (1972) (both on Warner Bros. Records), and \"Sextant\" (1973) (released on Columbia Records); two more, \"Realization\" and \"Inside Out\", were recorded under Henderson's name with essentially the same personnel. The music exhibited strong improvisational aspect beyond the confines of jazz mainstream and showed influence from the electronic music of contemporary classical composers. Hancock's three records released in 1971\u201373 later became known as the \"Mwandishi\" albums, so-called after a Swahili name Hancock sometimes used during this era (\"Mwandishi\" is Swahili for \"writer\"). The first two, including \"Fat Albert Rotunda\", were made available on the two-CD set \"Mwandishi: the Complete Warner Bros. Recordings\", released in 1994. \"Hornets\" was later revised on the 2001 album \"Future2Future\" as \"Virtual Hornets\".\nAmong the instruments Hancock and Gleeson used were Fender Rhodes piano, ARP Odyssey, ARP 2600, ARP Pro Soloist Synthesizer, a Mellotron and the Moog synthesizer III.\nFrom \"Head Hunters\" (1973) to \"Secrets\" (1976).\nHancock formed the Headhunters, keeping only Maupin from the sextet and adding bassist Paul Jackson, percussionist Bill Summers, and drummer Harvey Mason. The album \"Head Hunters\" (1973) was a hit, crossing over to pop audiences but criticized within his jazz audience. Stephen Erlewine, in a retrospective summary for AllMusic, said, \"\"Head Hunters\" still sounds fresh and vital three decades after its initial release, and its genre-bending proved vastly influential on not only jazz, but funk, soul, and hip-hop.\"\nDrummer Mason was replaced by Mike Clark, and the band released a second album, \"Thrust\", in 1974. (A live album from a Japan performance, consisting of compositions from those first two \"Head Hunters\" releases was released in 1975 as \"Flood\"). This was almost as well received as its predecessor, if not attaining the same level of commercial success. The Headhunters made another successful album called \"Survival of the Fittest\" in 1975 without Hancock, while Hancock himself started to make even more commercial albums, often featuring members of the band, but no longer billed as the Headhunters. The Headhunters reunited with Hancock in 1998 for \"Return of the Headhunters\", and a version of the band (featuring Clark) continues to play and record.\nIn 1973, Hancock was commissioned to compose the soundtrack for the controversial film \"The Spook Who Sat by the Door\", based on the novel of the same name by Sam Greenlee, who had grown up in the same neighborhood of Chicago as Hancock. In the following year, Hancock composed the soundtrack to the first \"Death Wish\" film. One of his songs, \"Joanna's Theme\", was re-recorded in 1997 on his duet album with Shorter, \"1+1\". Hancock's next jazz-funk albums of the 1970s were \"Man-Child\" (1975) and \"Secrets\" (1976), which point toward the more commercial direction Hancock would take over the next decade. These albums feature the members of the Headhunters band, but also a variety of other musicians in important roles.\nFrom \"V.S.O.P.\" (1976) to \"Future Shock\" (1983).\nIn 1978, Hancock recorded a duet with Chick Corea, who replaced him in the Davis band a decade earlier. Hancock also released a solo acoustic piano album, \"The Piano\" (1979), which was released only in Japan. (It was released in the US in 2004). Other Japan-only albums include \"Dedication\" (1974), ' (1977), and \"Direct Step\" (1978). ' was a VSOP album remastered for the US in 2004 and included a second concert from the tour in July 1979.\nFrom 1978 to 1982, Hancock recorded many albums of jazz-inflected disco and pop music, beginning with \"Sunlight\" (featuring guest musicians including Williams and Pastorius on the last track) (1978). Singing through a vocoder, he earned a British hit, \"I Thought It Was You\", although critics were unimpressed. This led to more vocoder on his next album, \"Feets, Don't Fail Me Now\" (1979), which gave him another UK hit in \"You Bet Your Love\".\nHancock toured with Williams and Carter in 1981, recording \"Herbie Hancock Trio\", a five-track album released only in Japan. A month later, he recorded \"Quartet\" with trumpeter Wynton Marsalis, released in the US the following year. Hancock, Williams, and Carter toured internationally with Wynton Marsalis and his brother, saxophonist Branford Marsalis, in what was known as \"VSOP II\". This quintet can be heard on Wynton Marsalis's debut album on Columbia (1981). In 1984 VSOP II performed at the Playboy Jazz Festival as a sextet with Hancock, Williams, Carter, the Marsalis Brothers, and Bobby McFerrin. In 1982, Hancock contributed to the album \"New Gold Dream (81,82,83,84)\" by Simple Minds, playing a synthesizer solo on the track \"Hunter and the Hunted\".\nIn 1983, Hancock had a pop hit with the Grammy Award-winning single \"Rockit\" from the album \"Future Shock\". It was the first jazz hip-hop song and became a worldwide anthem for breakdancers and for hip-hop in the 1980s. It was the first mainstream single to feature scratching, and also featured an innovative animated music video, which was directed by Godley and Creme and showed several robot-like artworks by Jim Whiting. The video was a hit on MTV and reached No.\u00a08 in the UK. The video won in five categories at the inaugural MTV Video Music Awards. This single ushered in a collaboration with noted bassist and producer Bill Laswell. Hancock experimented with electronic music on a string of three LPs produced by Laswell: \"Future Shock\" (1983), the Grammy Award-winning \"Sound-System\" (1984), and \"Perfect Machine\" (1988).\nDuring that period he appeared onstage at the Grammy Awards with Stevie Wonder, Howard Jones, and Thomas Dolby, in a synthesizer jam. Lesser known works from the 1980s are the live album \"Jazz Africa\" (1987) and the studio album \"Village Life\" (1984), which were recorded with Gambian kora player Foday Musa Suso. In 1985, Hancock performed as a guest on the album \"So Red the Rose\" (1985) by the Duran Duran spinoff group Arcadia. He also provided introductory and closing comments for the PBS rebroadcast in the United States of the BBC educational series from the mid-1980s, \"Rockschool\" (not to be confused with the most recent \"Gene Simmons' Rock School\" series).\nIn 1986, Hancock performed and acted in the film \"Round Midnight\". He also wrote the score/soundtrack, for which he won an Academy Award for Original Music Score. His film work was prolific during the 1980s, and included the scores to \"A Soldier's Story\" (1984), \"Jo Jo Dancer, Your Life Is Calling\" (1986), \"Action Jackson\" (1988 with Michael Kamen), \"Colors\" (1988), and the Eddie Murphy comedy \"Harlem Nights\" (1989). He would also write music for television commercials, with \"Maiden Voyage\" starting out as a cologne advertisement. At the end of the \"Perfect Machine\" tour, Hancock decided to leave Columbia Records after a 15-plus-year relationship.\n1990s to 2000.\nThe departure led to a hiatus from recording and the release of several compilations during the first half of the 1990s. He returned with Carter, Williams, Shorter, and Davis admirer Wallace Roney to record \"A Tribute to Miles\", which was released in 1994. The album contained two live recordings and studio recording songs, with Roney playing Davis's part as trumpet player. The album won a Grammy for best group album. Hancock also toured with Jack DeJohnette, Dave Holland, and Pat Metheny in 1990 on their \"Parallel Realities\" tour which included a performance at the Montreux Jazz Festival in July 1990, and scored the 1991 comedy film \"Livin' Large\", which starred Terrence C. Carson.\nHancock's next album, \"Dis Is da Drum\", released in 1994 is a return to acid jazz. Also in 1994, he appeared on the Red Hot Organization's compilation album \"\". The album, meant to raise awareness and funds in support of the AIDS epidemic in relation to the African-American community, was heralded as \"Album of the Year\" by \"Time\" magazine. In 1995, the release of \"The New Standard\" had Hancock and an all-star band that included John Scofield, DeJohnette and Michael Brecker, interpreting pop songs by Nirvana, Stevie Wonder, the Beatles, Prince, Peter Gabriel, and others.\nA 1997 duet album with Shorter, \"1+1\", was successful; the song \"Aung San Suu Kyi\" winning the Grammy Award for Best Instrumental Composition. Hancock also achieved great success in 1998 with his album \"Gershwin's World\", which featured readings of George and Ira Gershwin standards by Hancock and a plethora of guest stars, including Stevie Wonder, Joni Mitchell and Shorter. Hancock toured the world in support of \"Gershwin's World\" with a sextet featuring Cyro Baptista, Terri Lynne Carrington, Ira Coleman, Eli Degibri, and Eddie Henderson.\n2000 to 2009.\nIn 2001, Hancock recorded \"Future2Future\", which reunited Hancock with Laswell and featured doses of electronica as well as turntablist Rob Swift of the X-Ecutioners. Hancock later toured with the band, and released a concert DVD with a different lineup, which also included the \"Rockit\" music video. Also in 2001 Hancock partnered with Brecker and Roy Hargrove to record a live concert album saluting Davis and John Coltrane, \"\", recorded live in Toronto. The threesome toured to support the album, and toured on-and-off through 2005.\nA duet album called \"Possibilities\" was released in 2005. It featured duets with Carlos Santana, Paul Simon, Annie Lennox, John Mayer, Christina Aguilera, Sting, and others. In 2006, \"Possibilities\" received nominations for Grammy Awards in two categories: \"A Song for You\" (featuring Aguilera) was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Pop Instrumental Performance, and \"Gelo No Montanha\" (featuring Trey Anastasio on guitar) was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Instrumental Performance, although neither nomination resulted in an award.\nAlso in 2005, Hancock toured Europe with a new quartet that included Beninese guitarist Lionel Loueke and explored textures ranging from ambient to straight jazz to African music. During the summer, Hancock re-staffed the Headhunters and went on tour with them, including a performance at the Bonnaroo Music and Arts Festival. The lineup did not consist of any of the original Headhunters musicians. The group included Marcus Miller, Carrington, Loueke, and Mayer. Hancock also served as the first artist in residence for Bonnaroo in Manchester, Tennessee, that summer.\nIn 2006, Sony BMG Music Entertainment (which bought out Hancock's old label, Columbia Records) released the two-disc retrospective \"The Essential Herbie Hancock\". This set was the first compilation of his work at Warner Bros., Blue Note, Columbia and Verve/Polygram. This became Hancock's second major compilation of work since the 2002 Columbia-only \"The Herbie Hancock Box\", which was released at first in a plastic 4\u00a0\u00d7\u00a04 cube then re-released in 2004 in a long box set. Also in 2006, Hancock recorded a new song with Josh Groban and Eric Mouquet (co-founder of Deep Forest), \"Machine\", which featured on Groban's album \"Awake\". Hancock also recorded and improvised with guitarist Loueke on Loueke's 1996 debut album \"Virgin Forest\", on the ObliqSound label, resulting in two improvisational tracks \u2013 \"Le R\u00e9veil des agneaux (The Awakening of the Lambs)\" and \"La Poursuite du lion (The Lion's Pursuit)\".\nHancock, a longtime associate and friend of Joni Mitchell, released a 2007 album, \"\", that paid tribute to her work, with Norah Jones, Tina Turner, and Corinne Bailey Rae adding vocals to the album. Leonard Cohen contributed a spoken piece set to Hancock's piano. Mitchell herself also made an appearance. The album was released on September 25, 2007, simultaneously with the release of Mitchell's album \"Shine\". \"River\" won the 2008 Album of the Year Grammy Award. The album also won a Grammy for Best Contemporary Jazz Album, and the song \"Both Sides Now\" was nominated for Best Instrumental Jazz Solo, which made it only the second time in history that a jazz album won those two Grammy Awards.\nOn June 14, 2008, Hancock performed with others at Rhythm on the Vine at the South Coast Winery in Temecula, California for Shriners Hospitals for Children. The event raised $515,000 for Shriners Hospital. On January 18, 2009, Hancock performed at the , marking the start of inaugural celebrations for American President Barack Obama. Hancock also performed \"Rhapsody in Blue\" at the 2009 Classical BRIT Awards with classical pianist Lang Lang. Hancock was named as the Los Angeles Philharmonic's creative chair for jazz for 2010\u201312.\n2010 to present.\nIn June 2010, Hancock released \"The Imagine Project\". On June 5, 2010, he received an Alumni Award from his alma mater Grinnell College. On July 22, 2011, at a ceremony in Paris, he was named UNESCO Goodwill Ambassador for the promotion of Intercultural Dialogue. In 2013, Hancock joined the University of California, Los Angeles faculty as a professor in the UCLA music department teaching jazz music.\nIn a June 2010 interview with Michael Gallant of \"Keyboard\" magazine, Hancock talks about his Fazioli giving him inspiration to do things. On December 8, 2013, Hancock was given the Kennedy Center Honors Award for achievement in the performing arts. Terence Blanchard was the musical director and arranged Hancock compositions for performances with artists like Wayne Shorter, Joshua Redman, Vinnie Colaiuta, Lionel Loueke, and Aaron Parks. Snoop Dogg performed a mash-up of the US3 arrangement of Hancock's \"Cantaloupe Island\" and his own \"Gin and Juice\". Mixmaster Mike from the Beastie Boys was featured on a rendition of Hancock's \"Rockit\".\nHancock appeared on the album \"You're Dead!\" by Flying Lotus, released in October 2014. He was the 2014 Charles Eliot Norton Professor of Poetry at Harvard University. Holders of the chair deliver a series of six lectures on poetry, \"The Norton Lectures\", poetry being \"interpreted in the broadest sense, including all poetic expression in language, music, or fine arts\". Previous Norton lecturers include musicians Leonard Bernstein, Igor Stravinsky, and John Cage. Hancock's theme is \"The Ethics of Jazz\".\nHancock's next album is being produced by Terrace Martin, and will feature a broad variety of jazz and hip-hop artists including Wayne Shorter, Kendrick Lamar, Kamasi Washington, Thundercat, Flying Lotus, Lionel Loueke, Zakir Hussein, and Snoop Dogg. On May 15, 2015, Hancock received an honorary doctor of humane letters degree from Washington University in St. Louis. On May 19, 2018, he received an honorary degree from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. On June 26, 2022, he performed at the Glastonbury Festival.

In a 2019 interview, Herbie said: \"Gigi is very compassionate. She really cares about other people. She spends most of her time helping her friends. She has a big heart. At the same time she won't let you get away with anything. If you try to sneak something past her, she'll call you on it in a second. She got me into the pop art scene in New York in the 1960s and I introduced her to my jazz world.\"\nIn 1985, Hancock's sister, Jean, a computer consultant and a lyricist who wrote for him, Earth, Wind &amp; Fire, Dianne Reeves, and Booker T. &amp; the M.G.'s, was killed in the crash of Delta Air Lines Flight 191.\nIn his memoir \"Possibilities\", written with Lisa Dickey and published in 2014, Hancock revealed that he had previously battled an addiction to crack cocaine, in the 1990s, and that his wife and daughter helped him get sober: \"This was an intervention, and I was so embarrassed, but there was another feeling creeping in, too: relief. I had been struggling with this habit, and this secret, for so long. I looked at my daughter and sobbed, wondering how I had gotten to this place but thankful that it was finally going to end\". Since 1972, Hancock has practiced Nichiren Buddhism as a member of the Buddhist association Soka Gakkai International. Part of Hancock's spiritual practice is to recite the Buddhist chant \"Nam Myoho Renge Kyo\" each day. In 2013, Hancock's dialogue with musician Wayne Shorter and Soka Gakkai International president Daisaku Ikeda on jazz, Buddhism and life was published in Japanese and English, then in French.\nIn 2014, Hancock delivered a lecture at Harvard University titled \"Buddhism and Creativity\" as part of his Norton Lecture series.\nCobra automobile ownership.\nIn 1963, at the age of 23, Hancock purchased a new 1963 AC Shelby Cobra from a dealership in New York City for $6,000. He is still its owner and thus the longest owner of a Cobra. The car, serial number CSX2006, was the sixth Cobra ever produced, making it a rare and valuable vehicle. It is one of only 75 Cobras originally produced with a 260 cubic-inch engine and the only Cobra ever equipped with a two-barrel carburetor. The car has been estimated to be worth more than $2 million. Hancock plans to give the car to his grandson.\nDiscography.\nStudio albums.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "38124", "revid": "11096", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=38124", "title": "Mystery play", "text": "Medieval European play\nMystery plays and miracle plays (they are distinguished as two different forms although the terms are often used interchangeably) are among the earliest formally developed plays in medieval Europe. Medieval mystery plays focused on the representation of Bible stories in churches as tableaux with accompanying antiphonal song. They told of subjects such as the Creation, Adam and Eve, the murder of Abel, and the Last Judgment. Often they were performed together in cycles which could last for days. The name derives from \"mystery\" used in its sense of \"miracle,\" but an occasionally quoted derivation is from \"ministerium\", meaning \"craft\", and so the 'mysteries' or plays performed by the craft guilds.\nOrigins.\nAs early as the fifth century, living tableaux were introduced into sacred services. The plays originated as simple \"tropes\", verbal embellishments of liturgical texts, and slowly became more elaborate. At an early period chants from the service of the day were added to the prose dialogue. As these liturgical plays increased in popularity, vernacular forms emerged, and travelling companies of actors and theatrical productions became common in the later Middle Ages.\nThe \"Quem quaeritis?\" is the best known early form of the dramas. It is a schematic dialogue between the angel at the tomb of Christ and the women who are seeking his dead body. Early forms of the responsorium were later elaborated with dialogue and dramatic action. Early performances were given in Latin, and were preceded by a vernacular prologue spoken by a herald who gave a synopsis of the events. The writers and directors of the earliest plays were probably monks or clerics.\nIn 1210, suspicious of the growing popularity of miracle plays, Pope Innocent III issued a papal edict forbidding clergy from acting on a public stage. This had the effect of transferring the organization of the dramas to town guilds, after which several changes followed. Vernacular texts replaced Latin, and non-Biblical passages were added along with comic scenes, for example in the \"Secunda Pastorum\" of the Wakefield Cycle. Acting and characterization became more elaborate.\nThese vernacular religious performances were, in some of the larger cities in England such as York, performed and produced by guilds, with each guild taking responsibility for a particular piece of scriptural history. From the guild control originated the term mystery play or mysteries, from the Latin \"ministerium\" meaning \"occupation\" (i.e. that of the guilds). The genre was again banned as a result of the Reformation and the establishment of the Church of England in 1534.\nThe mystery play developed, in some places, into a series of plays dealing with major events in the Christian calendar, from the Creation to the Day of Judgment. By the end of the 15th century, the practice of acting these plays in cycles on festival days was established in several parts of Europe. Sometimes, each play was performed on a decorated pageant cart that moved about the city to allow different crowds to watch each play. The entire cycle could take up to twenty hours to perform and could be spread over a number of days. Taken as a whole, these are referred to as \"Corpus Christi cycles\". These cycles were often performed during the Feast of Corpus Christi.\nThe plays were performed by a combination of clerics and amateurs and were written in highly elaborate stanza forms; they were often marked by extravagant sets and special effects, but could also be stark and intimate. There was a wide variety of theatrical and poetic styles, even in a single cycle of plays.\nEnglish mystery plays.\nThere are four complete or nearly complete extant English biblical collections of plays. A collection is the \"York cycle\" of forty-eight pageants; there are also the \"Towneley plays\" of thirty-two pageants; the Ludus Coventriae; and the \"Chester cycle\" of twenty-four pageants, now generally agreed to be an Elizabethan reconstruction of older medieval traditions. Also extant are two pageants from a New Testament cycle acted at Coventry. Additionally, a fifteenth-century play of the life of Mary Magdalene, \"The Brome Abraham and Isaac\" and a sixteenth-century play of the \"Conversion of Saint Paul\" exist. Besides the Middle English drama, there are a few surviving plays in Cornish: namely, the Ordinalia (which is a cycle of three plays) and Pascon Agan Aruth which both tell biblical stories, and Bewnans Ke and Bewnans Meriasek, which tell the stories of the lives of saints.\nThese biblical plays differ widely in content. Most contain episodes such as the \"Fall of Lucifer\", the \"Creation and Fall of Man\", \"Cain and Abel\", \"Noah and the Flood\", \"Abraham and Isaac\", the \"Nativity\", the \"Raising of Lazarus\", the \"Passion\", and the \"Resurrection\". Other pageants included the story of \"Moses\", the \"Procession of the Prophets\", \"Christ's Baptism\", the \"Temptation in the Wilderness\", and the \"Assumption and Coronation of the Virgin\". In given cycles, the plays came to be sponsored by the newly emerging Medieval craft guilds. The York mercers, for example, sponsored the \"Doomsday\" pageant. Other guilds presented scenes appropriate to their trade: the building of the Ark from the carpenters' guild; the five loaves and fishes miracle from the bakers; and the visit of the Magi, with their offerings of gold, frankincense and myrrh, from the goldsmiths. The guild associations are not, however, to be understood as the method of production for all towns. While the Chester pageants are associated with guilds, there is no indication that the N-Town plays are either associated with guilds or performed on pageant wagons. Perhaps the most famous of the mystery plays, at least to modern readers and audiences, are those of Wakefield. Unfortunately, we cannot know whether the plays of the Towneley manuscript are actually the plays performed at Wakefield but a reference in the \"Second Shepherds' Play\" to Horbery Shrogys is strongly suggestive. In \"The London Burial Grounds\" by Mrs Basil Holmes (1897), the author claims that the Holy Priory Church, next to St Katherine Cree on Leadenhall Street, London was the location of miracle plays from the tenth to the sixteenth century. Edmund Bonner, Bishop of London (c 1500 - 1569) stopped this in 1542.\nSpanish mystery plays.\nThe oldest liturgical drama in Spain is from the 12th century and kept today in Toledo Cathedral. It is a play about the Biblical Magi, three wise men from the East who followed a star and visited the baby Jesus in Bethlehem. It is believed to have been based on an earlier play written in France.\nThe Misteri d'Elx (in English, the Elx Mystery Play or Mystery Play of Elx) is a liturgical drama dating from the 13th century which has been enacted and celebrated every year without any known interruptions. Commemorating the Assumption of Mary, it is played on every 14 and 15 August in the Basilica de Santa Mar\u00eda in the city of Elx (also known as Elche). The prohibition of theatrical plays in churches by the Council of Trent eventually threatened to interrupt the yearly performance of the Misteri, but in 1632 Pope Urban VIII issued a special permit for its continuation. In 2001, UNESCO declared it one of the Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity.\nMiracle play.\nMiracle plays, or Saint's plays, are now distinguished from mystery plays as they specifically re-enacted miraculous interventions by the saints, particularly Saint Nicholas or St. Mary, rather than biblical events. Robert Chambers, writing in the 19th century, notes that \"especially in England, miracle [came] to stand for religious play in general\".\nCornish language miracle plays, particularly the \"Ordinalia\" trilogy, the \"Beunans Meriasek\", and the \"Bewnans Ke\", were traditionally performed at the plain-an-gwarrys. To capture the attention of the audience, \"the plays were often noisy, bawdy and entertaining.\"\nModern performances.\nAttention to the Medieval Mystery plays began to grow during the early 1800s, after their reference and publication by William Hone and James Heywood Markland. Notably, poet Lord Byron wrote the plays Cain and as modern version of medieval dramas on similar subjects. Mystery plays are produced regularly throughout the United Kingdom. The local cycles were revived in both York and Chester in 1951 as part of the Festival of Britain, and are still performed by the local guilds. The N-Town cycle was revived in 1978 as the Lincoln mystery plays, and in 1994 the Lichfield Mysteries were revived.\nIn 1977 the National Theatre commissioned Tony Harrison to create \"The Mysteries\", a re-working of the Wakefield Cycle and others. It was again revived in 1985 (the production was filmed for Channel 4 Television), and as a part of the theatre's millennium celebration in 2000. The productions won Bill Bryden the Best Director title in both the 1985 \"Evening Standard\" Theatre Awards and the 1985 Laurence Olivier Awards, the year the three plays first appeared together in performance at the Lyceum Theatre.\nIn 2001, the Isango Ensemble produced an African version of the Chester Cycle at the Garrick Theatre in London as \"The Mysteries \u2013 Yiimimangaliso\", performing in a combination of the Xhosa language, Zulu, English, Latin, and Afrikaans. They revived an adapted version of the production at Shakespeare's Globe in 2015 as \"The Mysteries\". In 2004, two mystery plays (one focusing on the Creation and the other on the Passion) were performed at Canterbury Cathedral, with actor Edward Woodward in the role of God. The large cast also included Daniel MacPherson, Thomas James Longley and Joseph McManners.\nSince 2019, members of the University of Oxford have staged several cycles of Medieval Mystery Plays in different languages at St Edmund Hall.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is considered one of the most important and widely used inequalities in mathematics.\nInner products of vectors can describe finite sums (via finite-dimensional vector spaces), infinite series (via vectors in sequence spaces), and integrals (via vectors in Hilbert spaces). The inequality for sums was published by Augustin-Louis Cauchy\u00a0(1821). The corresponding inequality for integrals was published by Viktor Bunyakovsky\u00a0(1859) and Hermann Schwarz\u00a0(1888). Schwarz gave the modern proof of the integral version.\nStatement of the inequality.\nThe Cauchy\u2013Schwarz inequality states that for all vectors formula_1 and formula_2 of an inner product space\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Numbered block/styles.css\" /&gt;\nwhere formula_3 is the inner product. Examples of inner products include the real and complex dot product; see the examples in inner product. Every inner product gives rise to a Euclidean formula_4 norm, called the canonical or induced norm, where the norm of a vector formula_1 is denoted and defined by\nformula_6 where formula_7 is always a non-negative real number (even if the inner product is complex-valued). \nBy taking the square root of both sides of the above inequality, the Cauchy\u2013Schwarz inequality can be written in its more familiar form in terms of the norm:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Numbered block/styles.css\" /&gt;\nMoreover, the two sides are equal if and only if formula_1 and formula_2 are linearly dependent.\nSpecial cases.\nSedrakyan's lemma \u2013 positive real numbers.\nSedrakyan's inequality, also known as Bergstr\u00f6m's inequality, Engel's form, Titu's lemma (or the T2 lemma), states that for real numbers formula_10 and positive real numbers formula_11:\nformula_12\nor, using summation notation,\nformula_13\nIt is a direct consequence of the Cauchy\u2013Schwarz inequality, obtained by using the dot product on formula_14 upon substituting formula_15 and formula_16. This form is especially helpful when the inequality involves fractions where the numerator is a perfect square.\nR2 - The plane.\nThe real vector space formula_17 denotes the 2-dimensional plane. It is also the 2-dimensional Euclidean space where the inner product is the dot product. \nIf formula_18 and formula_19 then the Cauchy\u2013Schwarz inequality becomes:\nformula_20\nwhere formula_21 is the angle between formula_1 and formula_2.\nThe form presented here is perhaps the easiest in which to understand the inequality, as the square of the cosine can be at most 1, which occurs when the vectors are in the same or opposite directions. It can also be restated in terms of the vector coordinates formula_24, formula_25, formula_26, and formula_27 as\nformula_28\nwhere equality holds if and only if the vector formula_29 is in the same or opposite direction as the vector formula_30, or if one of them is the zero vector.\nR\"n\": \"n\"-dimensional Euclidean space.\nIn Euclidean space formula_14 with the standard inner product, which is the dot product, the Cauchy\u2013Schwarz inequality becomes:\nformula_32\nThe Cauchy\u2013Schwarz inequality can be proved using only elementary algebra in this case by observing that the difference of the right and the left hand side is \nformula_33 \nor by considering the following quadratic polynomial in formula_34\nformula_35\nSince the latter polynomial is nonnegative, it has at most one real root, hence its discriminant is less than or equal to zero. That is,\nformula_36\nC\"n\": \"n\"-dimensional complex space.\nIf formula_37 with formula_38 and formula_39 (where formula_40 and formula_41) and if the inner product on the vector space formula_42 is the canonical complex inner product (defined by formula_43 where the bar notation is used for complex conjugation), then the inequality may be restated more explicitly as follows: \nformula_44\nThat is,\nformula_45\n\"L\"2.\nFor the inner product space of square-integrable complex-valued functions, the following inequality holds.\nformula_46\nThe H\u00f6lder inequality is a generalization of this.\nApplications.\nAnalysis.\nIn any inner product space, the triangle inequality is a consequence of the Cauchy\u2013Schwarz inequality, as is now shown: \nformula_47\nTaking square roots gives the triangle inequality:\nformula_48\nThe Cauchy\u2013Schwarz inequality is used to prove that the inner product is a continuous function with respect to the topology induced by the inner product itself.\nGeometry.\nThe Cauchy\u2013Schwarz inequality allows one to extend the notion of \"angle between two vectors\" to any real inner-product space by defining:\nformula_49\nThe Cauchy\u2013Schwarz inequality proves that this definition is sensible, by showing that the right-hand side lies in the interval [\u22121,\u00a01] and justifies the notion that (real) Hilbert spaces are simply generalizations of the Euclidean space. It can also be used to define an angle in complex inner-product spaces, by taking the absolute value or the real part of the right-hand side, as is done when extracting a metric from quantum fidelity.\nProbability theory.\nLet formula_50 and formula_51 be random variables. Then the covariance inequality is given by:\nformula_52\nAfter defining an inner product on the set of random variables using the expectation of their product,\nformula_53\nthe Cauchy\u2013Schwarz inequality becomes\nformula_54\nTo prove the covariance inequality using the Cauchy\u2013Schwarz inequality, let formula_55 and formula_56 then\nformula_57\nwhere formula_58 denotes variance and formula_59 denotes covariance.\nProofs.\nThere are many different proofs of the Cauchy\u2013Schwarz inequality other than those given below. \nWhen consulting other sources, there are often two sources of confusion. First, some authors define \u27e8\u22c5,\u22c5\u27e9 to be linear in the second argument rather than the first. \nSecond, some proofs are only valid when the field is formula_60 and not formula_61\nThis section gives two proofs of the following theorem:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Math_theorem/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCauchy\u2013Schwarz inequality\u2014 \nLet formula_1 and formula_2 be arbitrary vectors in an inner product space over the scalar field formula_64 where formula_65 is the field of real numbers formula_66 or complex numbers formula_67 Then\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Numbered block/styles.css\" /&gt;\nwith &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Visible anchor/styles.css\" /&gt;equality holding in the Cauchy\u2013Schwarz Inequality if and only if formula_1 and formula_2 are linearly dependent. \nMoreover, if formula_70) is the same. It is presented immediately below only once to reduce repetition. It also includes the easy part of the proof of the Equality Characterization given above; that is, it proves that if formula_1 and formula_2 are linearly dependent then formula_73 \nConsequently, the Cauchy\u2013Schwarz inequality only needs to be proven only for non-zero vectors and also only the non-trivial direction of the Equality Characterization must be shown. \nProof via the orthogonal projection.\nThe special case of formula_74 was proven above so it is henceforth assumed that formula_75\nLet\nformula_76If we look at its length, we will seeformula_77Since the length of any vector is always non-negative, we getformula_78The Cauchy\u2013Schwarz inequality follows by multiplying by formula_79 and then taking the square root. \nMoreover, if the relation formula_80 in the above expression is actually an equality, then formula_81 and hence formula_82 the definition of formula_83 then establishes a relation of linear dependence between formula_1 and formula_85 The converse was proved at the beginning of this section, so the proof is complete. formula_86\nProof by analyzing a quadratic.\nConsider an arbitrary pair of vectors formula_87. Define the function formula_88 defined by formula_89, where formula_90 is a complex number satisfying formula_91 and formula_92.\nSuch an formula_90 exists since if formula_94 then formula_90 can be taken to be 1.\nSince the inner product is positive-definite, formula_96 only takes non-negative real values. On the other hand, formula_96 can be expanded using the bilinearity of the inner product:\nformula_98\nThus, formula_99 is a polynomial of degree formula_100 (unless formula_101 which is a case that was checked earlier). Since the sign of formula_99 does not change, the discriminant of this polynomial must be non-positive:\nformula_103\nThe conclusion follows.\nFor the equality case, notice that formula_104 happens if and only if formula_105 If formula_106 then formula_107 and hence formula_108\nGeneralizations.\nVarious generalizations of the Cauchy\u2013Schwarz inequality exist. H\u00f6lder's inequality generalizes it to formula_109 norms. More generally, it can be interpreted as a special case of the definition of the norm of a linear operator on a Banach space (Namely, when the space is a Hilbert space). Further generalizations are in the context of operator theory, e.g. for operator-convex functions and operator algebras, where the domain and/or range are replaced by a C*-algebra or W*-algebra.\nAn inner product can be used to define a positive linear functional. For example, given a Hilbert space formula_110 being a finite measure, the standard inner product gives rise to a positive functional formula_111 by formula_112 Conversely, every positive linear functional formula_111 on formula_114 can be used to define an inner product formula_115 where formula_116 is the pointwise complex conjugate of formula_117 In this language, the Cauchy\u2013Schwarz inequality becomes\nformula_118\nwhich extends verbatim to positive functionals on C*-algebras:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Math_theorem/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCauchy\u2013Schwarz inequality for positive functionals on C*-algebras\u2014If formula_111 is a positive linear functional on a C*-algebra formula_120 then for all formula_121 &lt;math&gt;\\left\nThe next two theorems are further examples in operator algebra.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Math_theorem/styles.css\" /&gt;\nKadison\u2013Schwarz inequality\u00a0( Named after Richard Kadison\n)\u2014 If formula_111 is a unital positive map, then for every normal element formula_123 in its domain, we have formula_124 and formula_125\nThis extends the fact formula_126 when formula_111 is a linear functional. The case when formula_123 is self-adjoint, that is, formula_129 is sometimes known as Kadison's inequality.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Math_theorem/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCauchy\u2013Schwarz inequality\u00a0(Modified Schwarz inequality for 2-positive maps)\u2014For a 2-positive map formula_111 between C*-algebras, for all formula_131 in its domain,\nformula_132\nAnother generalization is a refinement obtained by interpolating between both sides of the Cauchy\u2013Schwarz inequality: \n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Math_theorem/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCallebaut's Inequality\u2014For reals formula_133 \nformula_134\nThis theorem can be deduced from H\u00f6lder's inequality.

On 15 October 1974 Irish Republican internees burned 21 of the compounds used to house the internees thereby destroying much of Long Kesh.\nThe prison was situated at the former Royal Air Force station of Long Kesh, on the outskirts of Lisburn. This was in the townland of Maze, about southwest of Belfast. The prison and its inmates were involved in such events as the 1981 hunger strike. The prison was closed in 2000 and demolition began on 30 October 2006, but on 18 April 2013 it was announced by the Northern Ireland Executive that the remaining buildings would be redeveloped into a peace centre, however these plans were later abandoned.\nBackground.\nFollowing the introduction of internment in 1971, Operation Demetrius was implemented by the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) and British Army with raids for 452 suspects on 9 August 1971. The RUC and army arrested 342 Irish nationalists, but key Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) members had been tipped off and 104 of those arrested were released when it emerged they had no paramilitary connections. Those behind Operation Demetrius were accused of bungling the raids by arresting many of the wrong people and using out-of-date information. Following nationalist protests, some Ulster loyalists were also arrested. By 1972, there were 924 internees and by the end of internment on 5 December 1975, 1,981 people had been detained; 1,874 (94.6%) of whom were Catholic/Irish nationalist and 107 (5.4%) Ulster Protestants/loyalists.\nInitially, the internees were housed with different paramilitary groups separated from each other, in Nissen huts at a disused RAF airfield that became the Long Kesh Detention Centre. The internees and their supporters agitated for improvements in their conditions and status; they saw themselves as political prisoners rather than common criminals. In July 1972, the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, William Whitelaw introduced Special Category Status for those sentenced for crimes relating to the civil violence. There were 1,100 Special Category Status prisoners at that time.\nSpecial Category Status for convicted paramilitary-linked prisoners gave them the same privileges previously available only to internees. These privileges included free association between prisoners, extra visits, food parcels, and the right to wear their own clothes rather than prison uniforms.\nHowever, Special Category Status was short-lived. As part of a new British policy of \"criminalisation\" and coinciding with the end of internment, the new Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Merlyn Rees, ended Special Category Status from 1 March 1976. Those convicted of \"scheduled terrorist offences\" after that date were housed in the eight new \"H-Blocks\" that had been constructed at Long Kesh, now officially named Her Majesty's Prison Maze. Existing prisoners remained in separate compounds and retained their Special Category Status with the last prisoner to hold this status being released in 1986. Some had their Special Category Status stripped away and were recategorized as common criminals. Brendan Hughes, an IRA prisoner, had been imprisoned with Special Category Status in Cage 11, but was alleged to have been involved in a fight with warders. Within a span of several hours he was taken to court, convicted, and placed in the H-Blocks as a common criminal.\nH-Blocks.\nPrisoners convicted of scheduled offences after 1 March 1976 were housed in the \"H-Blocks\" that had been newly constructed. Prisoners without Special Category Status began protesting for its return immediately after they were transferred to the H-Blocks. Their first act of defiance, initiated by Kieran Nugent, was to refuse to wear the prison uniforms, stating that convicted criminals, and not political prisoners, wear uniforms. Not allowed their own clothes, they wrapped themselves in bedsheets. Prisoners participating in the protest were \"on the blanket\". By 1978, more than 300 men had joined the protest. The British government refused to back down.\nIn March 1978, some prisoners refused to leave their cells to shower or use the lavatory because they were being beaten when they did, and were provided with wash-hand basins in their cells. Prisoners \"on the blanket\" reported that one of the things that caused the most stress was \"...waiting for the moment the cell door would open and they would be dragged out, naked and defenseless, and then pounded into semi-consciousness before being thrown back in again\".\nRepublican prisoners were also abused prior to and upon entering the Maze. Writing about the abuse of prisoners Queen's University Belfast professor Phil Scraton stated: \"...it is evident they endured unacceptable levels of physical and psychological punishment, violence and violation. Administered purposefully, without the checks and balances of state institutional accountability, it constituted cruel, inhumane and degrading treatment/ punishment within the UN General Assembly\u2019s 1975 definition of torture.\" In 1978, the British government was found guilty and censured by the European Court of Human Rights for \"cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment in the interrogation procedures\".\nThe prisoners requested that showers be installed in their cells; when this request was denied, they refused to use the wash-hand basins. At the end of April 1978, a fight occurred between a prisoner and a prison officer in H-Block 6. The prisoner was taken away to solitary confinement, and rumours spread across the wing that the prisoner had been badly beaten. The prisoners responded by smashing the furniture in their cells, causing the prison authorities to remove the remaining furniture from the cells, leaving only blankets and mattresses. The prisoners responded by refusing to leave their cells and, as a result, the prison officers were unable to clear them. This resulted in the blanket protest escalating into the dirty protest, as the prisoners would not leave their cells to \"slop out\" (i.e., empty their chamber pots), and started smearing excrement on the walls of their cells to \"mitigate the spread of maggots\".\nHunger strike.\nRepublicans outside the prison took the battle to the media and both sides fought for public support. Inside the prison, the prisoners took another step and organised a hunger strike.\nOn 27 October 1980, seven republican prisoners refused food and demanded political status. The Conservative government led by Margaret Thatcher did not initially give in. In December, the prisoners called off the hunger strike when the government appeared to concede to their demands. However, the government immediately reverted to their previous stance, in the belief that the prisoners would not start another strike. Bobby Sands, the leader of the Provisional IRA prisoners, began a second action on 1 March 1981. Outside the prison, in a major publicity coup, Sands was nominated for Parliament and won the Fermanagh and South Tyrone by-election. But the British government still resisted and on 5 May, after 66 days on hunger strike, Sands died. More than 100,000 people attended Sands's funeral in Belfast. Another nine hunger strikers (members of both the IRA and the INLA) died by the end of August before the hunger strike was called off in October.\nBreakouts and attempted breakouts.\nOn 25 September 1983, the Maze saw the biggest prison escape in British peacetime history. Thirty-eight prisoners hijacked a prison meals lorry and smashed their way out. During the breakout, four prison officers were stabbed. Officer James Ferris, stabbed three times, died from a heart attack. Another officer was shot in the head by Gerry Kelly, and several other officers were injured by the escapees. Nineteen of the prisoners were soon recaptured, but the other nineteen escaped.\nIn March 1997, an IRA escape attempt was foiled when a tunnel was found. The tunnel led from H-Block 7 and was short of the perimeter wall.\nIn December 1997, IRA prisoner Liam Averill escaped dressed as a woman during a Christmas party for prisoners' children. Averill, who was jailed for life after committing two murders, was not recaptured, and was instead given amnesty in early 2001 when he was one of a number of republican escapees to present themselves to the authorities in a two-week period.\nOrganisation.\nDuring the 1980s, the British government slowly introduced changes, granting what some would see as political status in all but name. Republican and loyalist prisoners were housed according to group. They organised themselves along military lines and exercised wide control over their respective H-Blocks. The Loyalist Volunteer Force (LVF) leader Billy Wright was shot dead in December 1997 by two Irish National Liberation Army (INLA) prisoners.\nPeace process.\nThe prisoners also played a significant role in the Northern Ireland peace process. On 9 January 1998, the British Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Mo Mowlam, paid a surprise visit to the prison to talk to members of the Ulster Defence Association including Johnny Adair, Sam \"Skelly\" McCrory and Michael Stone. They had voted for their political representatives to pull out of talks. Shortly after Mowlam's visit, they changed their minds, allowing their representatives to continue talks that would lead to the Good Friday Agreement of 10 April 1998. Afterwards, the prison was emptied of its paramilitary prisoners as the groups they represented agreed to the ceasefire. In the two years following the agreement, 428 prisoners were released. On 29 September 2000, the remaining four prisoners at the Maze were transferred to other prisons in Northern Ireland and the Maze Prison was closed.\nMaze Long Kesh Development Corporation.\nA monitoring group was set up on 14 January 2003 to debate the future of the site. With close motorway and rail links, there were many proposals, including a museum, a multi-purpose sports stadium and an office, hotel and leisure village.\nIn January 2006, the government unveiled a masterplan for the site incorporating many of these proposals, including a 45,000 seat national multi-sport stadium for football, rugby and Gaelic games. The government's infrastructure organisation, the Strategic Investment Board (SIB), was tasked with the proposed stadium, appointing one of its senior advisers, Tony Whitehead, to manage the project. The capacity of the proposed stadium was later adjusted to first 35,000 and then 38,000 and the organising bodies of all three sports \u2013 Irish FA, Ulster Rugby and Ulster GAA \u2013 agreed in principle to support the integrated scheme. In October 2006, demolition work began in preparation for construction.\nIn January 2009, plans to build the new multi-purpose stadium on the site of the prison were cancelled. Gregory Campbell, the Minister of Culture, Arts and Leisure, cited a lack of support and concerns for a net loss to the economy.\nDiscussion is still ongoing as to the listed status of sections of the old prison. The hospital and part of the H-Blocks are currently listed buildings, and would remain as part of the proposed site redevelopment as a \"conflict transformation centre\" with support from republicans such as Martin McGuinness and opposition from unionists worried it may become \"a shrine to the IRA\".\nIn January 2013, plans were approved by the Northern Ireland environment minister Alex Attwood for the site to be redeveloped as showgrounds as the result of an application by the Royal Ulster Agricultural Society with the objective of relocating Balmoral Show from its current location in Belfast. The site is now known as Balmoral Park.\nIn October 2019, the European Union withdrew \u00a318m that had been approved to develop a peace centre, due to disagreements between Sinn F\u00e9in and the Democratic Unionist Party.\nIn April 2020, the former prison was reportedly under consideration for conversion into a temporary hospital during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nIn 2025, it was revealed that the regeneration project would be limited to \"health and safety\".\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He signed with record producer Trevor Horn's ZTT Records to release his eponymous debut studio album (1991). A critical and commercial success, it spawned the singles \"Crazy\" and \"Killer\", which peaked at numbers two and one on the UK singles chart, respectively, while both entered the US \"Billboard\" Hot 100. His 1994 single, \"Kiss from a Rose\", peaked atop the latter chart after its inclusion on the accompanying film soundtracks for \"The NeverEnding Story III\" and \"Batman Forever\".\n\"Kiss from a Rose\" spawned from Seal's second eponymous studio album (1994), which peaked atop the UK Albums Chart along with its predecessor. His following albums\u2014\"Human Being\" (1998), \"Seal IV\" (2003), \"System\" (2007), \"Soul\" (2008), \"\" (2010), \"Soul 2\" (2011), \"7\" (2015) and \"Standards\" (2017)\u2014were each met with critical praise.

Seal was raised by a foster family in Westminster, London. He received a two-year diploma in architecture and had various jobs in the London area.\nCareer.\nEarly career.\nIn the 1980s, Seal spent a short time singing in local clubs and bars. In 1987, he joined Push, a British funk band, and toured with them in Japan. In Thailand, he joined a blues band for a while before separating from the group and journeying throughout India on his own. He returned to England, sleeping on the couch of friend Julian Bunster, then a model. He sometimes asked him, \"Do I sing well?\", to which he often received the response that he sang better than most current artists. Then he met the producer Adamski to whom Seal provided lyrics and vocals on Adamski's single \"Killer\".\nInitial success: 1990s.\n\"Killer\" eventually reached number one in the UK. Seal subsequently signed to ZTT Records and released his self-titled d\u00e9but album (produced by Trevor Horn) in 1991. Two versions of the album are known to be in circulation: the original \"premix\" version and a second, more common version with an updated mix. This is attributed to the demand for a produced single rushing the final album edit and, as Seal puts it, producer Horn's \"inability to let go\".\n\"Seal\" was positively received by critics. The singles \"Crazy\", \"Future Love Paradise\" and his own rendition of \"Killer\" performed well on the charts. In particular, \"Crazy\" became an international hit in 1991, reaching number two in the UK Singles Chart and number seven on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 in the US. Seal stole the show at the 1992 Brit Awards held at the Hammersmith Odeon, London, with the first hat-trick of wins in the history of the event. He won in three categories: Best British Male, Best British Video (\"Killer\") and Best British Album (\"Seal\").\nIn 1992, Seal appeared on the Red Hot Organization's compilation CD \"Red Hot + Dance\", contributing an exclusive track \"Crazy (If I Was Trev Mix)\". The album, featuring George Michael and Madonna among others, raised money and awareness in support of the AIDS epidemic by donating all proceeds to AIDS charities.\nJeff Beck and Seal performed a cover of \"Manic Depression\" for the 1993 album \"\". Seal also contributed vocals to a cover of John Lennon's \"Imagine\" for the 2010 Herbie Hancock album, \"The Imagine Project\" along with P!nk, India.Arie, Jeff Beck, Konono N\u00ba1, Oumou Sangar\u00e9 and others.\nAfter Seal regrouped with Trevor Horn, his second album, also self-titled, was released in 1994. A success, the album featured the singles \"Prayer for the Dying\" and \"Newborn Friend\", and later received a Grammy nomination for Album of the Year. \"Prayer for the Dying\" became a minor pop hit in the US, peaking at number 21 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100. A third single, \"Kiss from a Rose\", performed modestly when released, but was later featured to much wider popularity when it was remixed for the soundtrack to \"Batman Forever\". \"Kiss from a Rose\" won a Grammy Award for Record of the Year and Grammy Award for Song of the Year in 1996, becoming Seal's best-performing single on the US market (it topped the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 in late August 1995) and hit number four in the UK.\nIn 1998, Seal released \"Human Being\". The album was the product of a turbulent time in his life, including a split and later reconciliation with producer Horn, as well as Seal's parting with ZTT Records and his signing with Warner Bros. Records in 1997. The record was panned upon its release. It received gold record certification by the RIAA just two months after its release date. The album provided two singles \u2013 \"Human Beings\" and \"Lost My Faith\".\n2000s.\nIn 2001, fans awaited the arrival of a new album, announced as \"Togetherland\". After a protracted postproduction period, the album was cancelled. The official word was that Seal simply did not think it made the grade, although this conflicts with other reports, that said the album was turned down by the label because producers felt the album would not be commercially successful. Even so, one single was released from the album; \"This Could Be Heaven\" was released in the US and featured on \"The Family Man\" soundtrack. Since December 2006, Seal has indicated that he has plans to excerpt cuts from \"Togetherland\" and make them available for streaming download. Meanwhile, Seal co-wrote and provided vocals for the hit single \"My Vision\" from Jakatta in 2002. He also recorded a successful duet with French singer Myl\u00e8ne Farmer called \"Les Mots\" during that same period. Also in 2002, Seal lent his vocals to the song \"You Are My Kind\", the fourth track on Santana's album \"Shaman\".\nIn 2003, Seal released his fourth album \"Seal IV\". Although it never achieved the sales figures of either of his first two albums, this release brought him back into the public eye in the United States and continental Europe. Singles from the album include \"Waiting for You\", \"Get It Together\" and \"Love's Divine\"; the latter was released in 2004 and was a big hit in several European countries.\nIn 2004, a greatest-hits album entitled \"Best 1991\u20132004\" was released, including a cover of the Bacharach/David classic \"Walk On By\" and a cover of Echo &amp; the Bunnymen's \"Lips Like Sugar\". An edition of the album was available that included an extra CD with acoustic versions of some of Seal's hits. Also in 2004, Seal performed shows at the Olympia Theatre in Paris. The show of 6 July 2004 was recorded and released about one year after as a CD/DVD package, simply titled \"Live in Paris\".\nIn June 2005, Seal recorded a concert which was subsequently released in 2006, entitled \"One Night to Remember\", as a CD/DVD combination. The DVD includes a \"making of\" documentary in addition to the live performance. Recorded in a historic steel mill, the \"Altes Kesselhaus\" (\"old boiler house\"), in D\u00fcsseldorf, Germany, this performance includes a version of Brahms' \"Lullaby\" which Seal sings in German and then in English. Unlike earlier recordings in which Seal is accompanied by his band, a full orchestra and choir of 52 musicians accompanies the singer.\n\"System\" was released in the UK on 12 November 2007 and in the US on 13 November 2007. Seal describes the album as more dance-oriented, apparently a return to the roots of his first album. On the track titled \"Wedding Day\", Seal sings a duet with his then-wife, model Heidi Klum. The album's first single, \"Amazing\", was released on 25 September 2007 and nominated for the \"Best Male Pop Vocal Performance\" Grammy at the 2007 50th Annual Grammy Awards.\nSeal performed \"Amazing\" and the Beatles' \"Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds\" at the 2007 Royal Variety Performance. Seal also performed \"Amazing\" at the 2007 Victoria's Secret Fashion Show in December, as well as the duet \"Wedding Day\" with his wife. Other performers at the 2007 Victoria's Secret Fashion Show include the Spice Girls and will.i.am of the Black Eyed Peas. He appeared on the \"American Idol\" season-seven finale, singing with third-place contestant Syesha Mercado.\nSeal's sixth studio album, \"Soul\", was released on 3 November 2008 internationally and on 11 November 2008 in the US. It contains 11 soul classics produced by David Foster. The first single was a cover of Sam Cooke's song \"A Change Is Gonna Come\".\nOn 14 March 2009, Seal performed a song from the album and coached the participants on the \"Top 9-Show\" of the sixth season of the German TV show \"Deutschland sucht den Superstar\" (\"German Idol\"). On 4 December 2009, \"Hits\", a compilation album, was released. It contains two new tracks, \"I Am Your Man\" and \"Thank You\".\n2010s.\nSeal's seventh studio album, \"\" was released on 20 September 2010 internationally and 28 September 2010 in the US. The first single \"Secret\" was released 10 August 2010 on iTunes in the US and in the UK on 13 September 2010. This album was said to be inspired by his wife, Heidi. On 7 November 2011, Seal released his second cover album of classic soul songs, \"Soul 2\", through Reprise Records.\nPerformance in Chechnya, 2011.\nIn October 2011, Seal was criticized by human-rights groups for appearing at an event in Grozny, Chechnya, that turned into a birthday celebration for Ramzan Kadyrov, the President of Chechnya. Also appearing at the event were the actress Hilary Swank, actor Jean-Claude Van Damme and violinist Vanessa-Mae. The New York-based Human Rights Foundation claims that it sent letters to invitees in advance of the event noting Kadyrov's record and asking them to decline the invitations. Human Rights Watch sent an enquiry to Seal regarding his performance at the event and released a statement about the incident that said:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Ramzan Kadyrov is linked to a litany of horrific human rights abuses. It's inappropriate for stars to get paid to party with him. It bolsters his image and legitimizes a brutal leader and his regime. And getting paid to be part of such a lavish show in Chechnya trivialises the suffering of countless victims of human rights abuses there.\nSeal refused to apologise for appearing at the event, sending a message from his Twitter account telling people to \"leave me out of your politics\". Seal was reported to have made $500,000 for singing at the party.\n2012\u20132017.\nIn 2012, Seal was one of the four vocal coaches in the first season of the Australian version of the reality singing competition \"The Voice\". He was the coach of the series winner Karise Eden. Seal returned to \"The Voice\" season two, which debuted on 7 April 2013, where he became the winning coach once again, coaching eventual winner Harrison Craig. He did not return for the third season in 2014, with the Nine Network stating that Seal \"will take a break from the third season of \"The Voice\" to focus on music and material for a new album.\" Channel NINE announced on 8 November 2016 that Seal would be returning alongside Delta Goodrem to \"The Voice\" as a coach in 2017, replacing Jessie J after a three-year hiatus.\nOn 15 November 2014, Seal joined the charity group Band Aid 30 along with other British and Irish pop acts, recording the latest version of the track \"Do They Know It's Christmas?\" at Sarm West Studios in Notting Hill, London, to raise money for the 2014 Ebola crisis in West Africa. Seal was cast as Pontius Pilate in Tyler Perry's musical rendition of \"The Passion\", which aired on Fox on 20 March 2016.\nSeal began work on a new album, initially entitled \"Let Yourself\", produced again by Horn. In February 2015, Horn said the album was nearly finished. Seal later re-signed to Perfect Songs and had a two-week writing period in Horn's Los Angeles studio booked for October 2012. Stewart Copeland (formerly of the Police) said that month on his Twitter feed that Trevor Horn and Lol Cr\u00e8me were working with Seal on a project. In April 2013, Seal said on Twitter that the new album would be released in about June (which did not eventuate) and that tracks to be included were \"Let Yourself\", \"Do You Ever\" and \"Laying with an Angel\". The album was later retitled \"Beautifully Scarred\". On 10 September 2015, Seal announced that the album, now named \"7\", would be released on 6 November 2015.\nSeal released the album \"Standards\" in November 2017. The album was produced by classical crossover composer Nick Patrick. It received a nomination for Best Traditional Pop Vocal Album at the 2018 Annual Grammy Awards.\n2020s.\nIn 2022, Seal launched his own limited-edition camera with Leica, a Q2 camera called Dawn, which is limited to 500 cameras.\nSeal announced a North American tour in 2023 with Trevor Horn as the musical director, who also doubles as the show opener with his band, The Buggles. In 2024, he released an alternate version of \"Kiss from a Rose\" with a deluxe edition of the album \"Seal\" upon its 30th anniversary.\nHe released a new song, \"All I Know is Now\", produced by Horn, on 14 February 2025.\nPersonal life.\nSeal's brother, Jeymes Samuel, better known as the Bullitts, is also a singer-songwriter.\nSeal first began dating German model Heidi Klum in February 2004, shortly after she announced her pregnancy and the end of her relationship with Italian Formula One team manager Flavio Briatore. Klum gave birth to Briatore's daughter in May 2004 in New York City with Seal at her side. According to Klum, Briatore is not involved in fathering duties and she has stated emphatically that Seal is Leni's father. Seal is her only father figure and he has praised Briatore for keeping his distance.\nSeal proposed to Klum on 23 December 2004 in a quinzee he had built on a glacier in Whistler, British Columbia. On 10\u00a0May 2005, the couple married on a beach in Mexico near Seal's home on Costa Careyes. Every year during their marriage, Seal and Klum renewed their vows on their anniversary with close friends and family. About these renewals, Seal said in 2010, \"Each year, Heidi and I get remarried. It's a great party, but for about an hour, we go off on our own down to a private beach. We sit there with the kids and read vows to each other as the sun sets. It's a very special moment to us\". In November 2009, Klum officially adopted Seal's surname and became legally known as Heidi Samuel.\nOn 11 June 2009, Seal, on tour with his new album \"Soul\", revealed, \"It is nice to be in newspapers and magazines for something other than my marriage\". He said his marriage to Klum may take away the attention, but does not detract from what he loves doing: making music. In February 2011, Klum praised Seal for his good parenting skills, saying, \"When I first met Seal he had a kindness and compassion that was so sincere I knew he'd be a good father... He has infinite amounts of love and patience for our kids... He puts me and the children first\". Klum also remarked how lucky she was to have a husband like Seal.\nIn late 2009, Seal officially adopted Klum's daughter and her last name was changed to Samuel. The couple have three other children: two sons, Henry G\u00fcnther Ademola Dashtu Samuel (born September 2005) and Johan Riley Fyodor Taiwo Samuel (born November 2006), and a daughter named Lou, born in October 2009.\nOn 22 January 2012, Seal and Klum announced that they were separating after nearly seven years of marriage. Klum filed for divorce from Seal on 6 April 2012. Their divorce was finalized on 14\u00a0October 2014.\nSince 2021, he has been in a relationship with his former personal assistant Laura Strayer.\nHealth.\nThe prominent scarring on Seal's face is the result of a type of lupus called discoid lupus erythematosus, which affects the skin and leaves large scars.\nCharity work.\nIn April 1992, Seal performed with the surviving members of Queen at The Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert held at London's Wembley Stadium five months after Mercury's death. Seal sang the 1986 Queen hit \"Who Wants to Live Forever\" and joined the rest of the acts for the all-star finale singing \"We Are the Champions\". Thomas Curtis-Horsfall of Smooth Radio stated Seal's performance of \"Who Wants to Live Forever\" was \"one of the standout moments\" from the concert, adding \"his spine-tingling rendition of the Queen classic had everyone in the arena close to tears.\"\nOn 10 March 2012, Seal shared the stage with Kanye West, Soul Rebels Brass Band and Snoop Dogg at Brad Pitt's Night to Make It Right Foundation New Orleans after-party, hosted by comedian Aziz Ansari. The charity event, hosted by Ellen DeGeneres, raised money to build homes for victims of Hurricane Katrina.\nDiscography.\nStudio albums\nAwards and nominations.\n! scope=\"col\" | Award\n! scope=\"col\" | Year\n! scope=\"col\" | Nominee(s)\n! scope=\"col\" | Category\n! scope=\"col\" | Result\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\"| Ref.\n!scope=\"row\"|APRA Music Awards\n!scope=\"row\"|BMI London Awards\n!scope=\"row\" rowspan=4|BMI Pop Awards\n!scope=\"row\" | Billboard Music Video Award\n!scope=\"row\"|Blockbuster Entertainment Awards\n!scope=\"row\" rowspan=8|Brit Awards\n!scope=\"row\" rowspan=4|Cash Box Year-End Awards\n!scope=\"row\" rowspan=15|Grammy Awards\n!scope=\"row\" rowspan=2|Hungarian Music Awards\n!scope=\"row\" rowspan=7|Ivor Novello Awards\n!scope=\"row\" rowspan=5|\u017deb\u0159\u00edk Music Awards \nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "38136", "revid": "34880281", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=38136", "title": "Seal (emblem)", "text": "Device for making an impression in wax or other medium\nA seal is a device for making an impression in wax, clay, paper, or some other medium, including an embossment on paper, and is also the impression thus made. The original purpose was to authenticate a document, or to prevent interference with a package or envelope by applying a seal which had to be broken to open the container (hence the modern English verb \"to seal\", which implies secure closing without an actual wax seal).\nThe seal-making device is also referred to as the seal \"matrix\" or \"die\"; the imprint it creates as the seal impression (or, more rarely, the \"sealing\"). If the impression is made purely as a relief resulting from the greater pressure on the paper where the high parts of the matrix touch, the seal is known as a \"dry seal\"; in other cases ink or another liquid or liquefied medium is used, in another color than the paper.\nIn most traditional forms of dry seal the design on the seal matrix is in intaglio (cut below the flat surface) and therefore the design on the impressions made is in relief (raised above the surface). The design on the impression will reverse (be a mirror-image of) that of the matrix, which is especially important when script is included in the design, as it very often is. This will not be the case if paper is embossed from behind, where the matrix and impression read the same way, and both matrix and impression are in relief. However engraved gems were often carved in relief, called cameo in this context, giving a \"counter-relief\" or intaglio impression when used as seals. The process is essentially that of a mould.\nMost seals have always given a single impression on an essentially flat surface, but in medieval Europe two-sided seals with two matrices were often used by institutions or rulers (such as towns, bishops and kings) to make two-sided or fully three-dimensional impressions in wax, with a \"tag\", a piece of ribbon or strip of parchment, running through them. These \"pendent\" seal impressions dangled below the documents they authenticated, to which the attachment tag was sewn or otherwise attached (single-sided seals were treated in the same way).\nIn the United States, the word \"seal\" is sometimes assigned to a facsimile of the seal design (in monochrome or color), which may be used in a variety of contexts including architectural settings, on flags, or on official letterheads. Thus, for example, the Great Seal of the United States, among other uses, appears on the reverse of the one-dollar bill; and several of the seals of the U.S. states appear on their respective state flags. In Europe, although coats of arms and heraldic badges may well feature in such contexts as well as on seals, the seal design in its entirety rarely appears as a graphical emblem and is used mainly as originally intended: as an impression on documents.\nThe study of seals is known as sigillography or sphragistics.\nAncient Near East.\n \nThe stamp seal was a common seal die, frequently carved from stone, known at least since the 6th millennium BC (Halaf culture) and probably earlier. The oldest stamp seals were button-shaped objects with primitive ornamental forms chiseled onto them.\nSeals were used in the earliest civilizations and are of considerable importance in archaeology and art history. In ancient Mesopotamia carved or engraved cylinder seals in stone or other materials were used. These could be rolled along to create an impression on clay (which could be repeated indefinitely), and used as labels on consignments of trade goods, or for other purposes. They are normally hollow and it is presumed that they were worn on a string or chain round the neck. Many have only images, often very finely carved, with no writing, while others have both. From ancient Egypt seals in the form of signet rings, including some with the names of kings, have been found; these tend to show only names in hieroglyphics.\nRecently, seals datable to the Himyarite age have come to light in South Arabia. One example shows a name written in Aramaic (Yits\u1e25aq bar \u1e24anina) engraved in reverse so as to read correctly in the impression.\nAncient Greece and Rome.\nFrom the beginning of the 3rd millennium BC until the Middle Ages, seals of various kinds were in production in the Aegean islands and mainland Greece. In the Early Minoan age these were formed of soft stone and ivory and show particular characteristic forms. By the Middle Minoan age a new set for seal forms, motifs and materials appear. Hard stone requires new rotary carving techniques. The Late Bronze Age is the time par excellence of the lens-shaped seal and the seal ring, which continued into the Archaic, Classical and Hellenistic periods, in the form of pictorial engraved gems. These were a major luxury art form and became keenly collected, with King Mithridates VI of Pontus the first major collector according to Pliny the Elder. His collection fell as booty to Pompey the Great, who deposited it in a temple in Rome. Engraved gems continued to be produced and collected until the 19th century. Pliny also explained the significance of the signet ring, and how over time this ring was worn on the little finger.\nEast Asia.\nKnown as \"yinzhang\" () in Greater China, \"injang\" in Korea, \"insh\u014d\" in Japan, \"\u1ea5n tri\u1ec7n\" (or \"\u1ea5n ch\u01b0\u01a1ng\") in Vietnam, seals have been used in East Asia as a form of written identification since the Qin dynasty (221 BC\u2013). The seals of the Han dynasty were impressed in a soft clay, but from the Tang dynasty a red ink made from cinnabar was normally used. Even in modern times, seals, often known as \"chops\" in local colloquial English, are still commonly used instead of handwritten signatures to authenticate official documents or financial transactions. Both individuals and organizations have official seals, and they often have multiple seals in different sizes and styles for different situations. East Asian seals usually bear the names of the people or organizations represented, but they can also bear poems or personal mottoes. Sometimes both types of seals, or large seals that bear both names and mottoes, are used to authenticate official documents. Seals are so important in East Asia that foreigners who frequently conduct business there also commission the engraving of personal seals.\nEast Asian seals are carved from a variety of hard materials, including wood, soapstone, sea glass and jade. East Asian seals are traditionally used with a red oil-based paste consisting of finely ground cinnabar, which contrasts with the black ink traditionally used for the ink brush. Red chemical inks are more commonly used in modern times for sealing documents. Seal engraving is considered a form of calligraphy in East Asia. Like ink-brush calligraphy, there are several styles of engraving. Some engraving styles emulate calligraphy styles, but many styles are so highly stylized that the characters represented on the seal are difficult for untrained readers to identify. Seal engravers are considered artists, and, in the past, several famous calligraphers also became famous as engravers. Some seals, carved by famous engravers, or owned by famous artists or political leaders, have become valuable as historical works of art.\nBecause seals are commissioned by individuals and carved by artists, every seal is unique, and engravers often personalize the seals that they create. The materials of seals and the styles of the engraving are typically matched to the personalities of the owners. Seals can be traditional or modern, or conservative or expressive. Seals are sometimes carved with the owners' zodiac animals on the tops of the seals. Seals are also sometimes carved with images or calligraphy on the sides.\nAlthough it is a utilitarian instrument of daily business in East Asia, westerners and other non-Asians seldom see Asian seals except on Asian paintings and calligraphic art. All traditional paintings in China, Japan, Korea, and the rest of East Asia are watercolor paintings on silk, paper, or some other surface to which the red ink from seals can adhere. East Asian paintings often bear multiple seals, including one or two seals from the artist, and the seals from the owners of the paintings.\nEast Asian seals are the predecessors to block printing.\nWestern tradition.\nThere is a direct line of descent from the seals used in the ancient world, to those used in medieval and post-medieval Europe, and so to those used in legal contexts in the western world to the present day. Seals were historically most often impressed in sealing wax (often simply described as \"wax\"): in the Middle Ages, this generally comprised a compound of about two-thirds beeswax to one-third of some kind of resin, but in the post-medieval period the resin (and other ingredients) came to dominate. During the early Middle Ages seals of lead, or more properly \"bullae\" (from the Latin), were in common use both in East and West, but with the notable exception of documents (\"bulls\") issued by the Papal Chancery these leaden authentications fell out of favour in western Christendom. Byzantine Emperors sometimes issued documents with gold seals, known as Golden Bulls.\nWax seals were being used on a fairly regular basis by most western royal chanceries by about the end of the 10th century. In England, few wax seals have survived of earlier date than the Norman Conquest, although some earlier matrices are known, recovered from archaeological contexts: the earliest is a gold double-sided matrix found near Postwick, Norfolk, and dated to the late 7th century; the next oldest is a mid-9th-century matrix of a Bishop Ethilwald (probably \u00c6thelwold, Bishop of East Anglia). The practice of sealing in wax gradually moved down the social hierarchy from monarchs and bishops to great magnates, to petty knights by the end of the 12th century, and to ordinary freemen by the middle of the 13th century. They also came to be used by a variety of corporate bodies, including cathedral chapters, municipalities, monasteries etc., to validate the acts executed in their name.\nTraditional wax seals continue to be used on certain high-status and ceremonial documents, but in the 20th century they were gradually superseded in many other contexts by inked or dry embossed seals and by rubber stamps.\nWhile many instruments formerly required seals for validity (e.g. deeds or covenants) it is now unusual in most countries in the west for private citizens to use seals. In Central and Eastern Europe, however, as in East Asia, a signature alone is considered insufficient to authenticate a document of any kind in business, and all managers, as well as many book-keepers and other employees, have personal seals, normally just containing text, with their name and their position. These are applied to all letters, invoices issued, and similar documents. In Europe these are today plastic self-inking stamps.\nNotaries also still use seals on a daily basis. At least in Britain, each registered notary has an individual personal seal, registered with the authorities, which includes his or her name and a pictorial emblem, often an animal\u2014the same combination found in many seals from ancient Greece.\nPractices.\nSeals are used primarily to authenticate documents, specifically those which carry some legal import. There are two main ways in which a seal may be attached to a document. It may be applied directly to the face of the paper or parchment (an \"applied seal\"); or it may hang loose from it (a \"pendent seal\"). A pendent seal may be attached to cords or ribbons (sometimes in the owner's livery colors), or to the two ends of a strip (or \"tag\") of parchment, threaded through holes or slots cut in the lower edge of the document: the document is often folded double at this point (a \"plica\") to provide extra strength. Alternatively, the seal may be attached to a narrow strip of the material of the document (again, in this case, usually parchment), sliced and folded down, as a tail or \"tongue\", but not detached. The object in all cases is to help ensure authenticity by maintaining the integrity of the relationship between document and seal, and to prevent the seal's reuse. If a forger tries to remove an applied seal from its document, it will almost certainly break. A pendent seal is easily detached by cutting the cords or strips of parchment, but the forger would then have great difficulty in attaching it to another document (not least because the cords or parchment are normally knotted inside the seal), and would again almost certainly break it.\nIn the Middle Ages, the majority of seals were pendent. They were attached both to legal instruments and to letters patent (i.e. open letters) conferring rights or privileges, which were intended to be available for all to view. In the case of important transactions or agreements, the seals of all parties to the arrangement as well as of witnesses might be attached to the document, and so once executed it would carry several seals. Most governments still attach pendent seals to letters patent.\nApplied seals, by contrast, were originally used to seal a document closed: that is to say, the document would be folded and the seal applied in such a way that the item could not be opened without the seal being broken. Applied seals were used on letters close (letters intended only for the recipient) and parcels to indicate whether or not the item had been opened or tampered with since it had left the sender, as well as providing evidence that the item was actually from the sender and not a forgery. In the post-medieval period, seals came to be commonly used in this way for private letters. A letter writer would fold the completed letter, pour wax over the joint formed by the top of the page, and then impress a ring or other seal matrix. Governments sometimes sent letters to citizens under the governmental seal for their eyes only, known as letters secret. Wax seals might also be used with letterlocking techniques to ensure that only the intended recipient would read the message. In general, seals are no longer used in these ways except for ceremonial purposes. However, applied seals also came to be used on legal instruments applied directly to the face of the document, so that there was no need to break them, and this use continues.\nDesigns.\nHistorically, the majority of seals were circular in design, although ovals, triangles, shield-shapes and other patterns are also known. The design generally comprised a graphic emblem (sometimes, but not always, incorporating heraldic devices), surrounded by a text (the \"legend\") running around the perimeter. The legend most often consisted merely of the words \"The seal of [the name of the owner]\", either in Latin or in the local vernacular language: the Latin word \"Sigillum\" was frequently abbreviated to a simple \"S:\". Occasionally, the legend took the form of a motto.\nIn the Middle Ages it became customary for the seals of women and of ecclesiastics to be given a vesica (pointed oval) shape. The central emblem was often a standing figure of the owner, or (in the case of ecclesiastical seals) of a saint. Medieval townspeople used a wide variety of different emblems but some had seals that included an image relating to their work.\nSealing wax was naturally yellowish or pale brownish in tone, but could also be artificially colored red or green (with many intermediary variations). In some medieval royal chanceries, different colours of wax were customarily used for different functions or departments of state, or to distinguish grants and decrees made in perpetuity from more ephemeral documents.\nThe matrices for pendent seals were sometimes accompanied by a smaller \"counter-seal\", which would be used to impress a small emblem on the reverse of the impression. In some cases the seal and counter-seal would be kept by two different individuals, in order to provide an element of double-checking to the process of authentication. Sometimes, a large official seal, which might be in the custody of chancery officials, would need to be counter-sealed by the individual in whose name it had been applied (the monarch, or the mayor of a town): such a counter-seal might be carried on the person (perhaps secured by a chain or cord), or later, take the form of a signet ring, and so would be necessarily smaller. Other pendent seals were double-sided, with elaborate and equally-sized obverses and reverses. The impression would be formed by pressing a \"sandwich\" of matrices and wax firmly together by means of rollers or, later, a lever-press or a screw press. Certain medieval seals were more complex still, involving two levels of impression on each side of the wax which would be used to create a scene of three-dimensional depth.\nOn the death of a seal-holder, as a sign of continuity, a son and heir might commission a new seal employing the same symbols and design-elements as those used by his father. It is likely that this practice was a factor in the emergence of hereditary heraldry in western Europe in the 12th century.\nEcclesiasticism.\nEcclesiastical seals are frequently mandorla-shaped, as in the shape of an almond, also known as vesica-shaped. The use of a seal by men of wealth and position was common before the Christian era, but high functionaries of the Church adopted the habit.\nAn incidental allusion in one of St. Augustine's letters (217 to Victorinus) indicates that he used a seal. The practice spread, and it seems to be taken for granted by King Clovis I at the very beginning of the Merovingian dynasty.\nLater ecclesiastical synods require that letters under the bishop's seal should be given to priests when for some reason they lawfully quit their own proper diocese. Such a ruling was enacted at Chalon-sur-Sa\u00f4ne in 813. Pope Nicholas I in the same century complained that the bishops of D\u00f4le and Reims had, \"contra morem\" (contrary to custom), sent their letters to him unsealed. The custom of bishops possessing seals may from this date be assumed to have been pretty general.\nIn the British Museum's collection, the earliest bishops' seals preserved are those of William de St-Calais, Bishop of Durham (1081\u201396) and of St. Anselm, Archbishop of Canterbury (1093\u20131109).\nArchitects, surveyors and professional engineers.\nSeals are also affixed on architectural or engineering construction documents, or land survey drawings, to certify the identity of the licensed professional who supervised the development. Depending on the authority having jurisdiction for the project, these seals may be embossed and signed, stamped and signed, or in certain situations a computer generated facsimile of the original seal validated by a digital certificate owned by the professional may be attached to a security protected computer file. The identities on the professional seals determine legal responsibility for any errors or omissions, and in some cases financial responsibility for their correction as well as the territory of their responsibility, e.g.: \"State of Minnesota\".\nIn some jurisdictions, especially in Canada, it is a legal requirement for a professional engineer to seal documents in accordance with the Engineering Profession Act and Regulations. Professional engineers may also be legally entitled to seal any document they prepare. The seal identifies work performed by, or under the direct supervision of, a licensed professional engineer, and assures the document's recipient that the work meets the standards expected of experienced professionals who take personal responsibility for their judgments and decisions.\nCustom houses.\nIn old English law, a cocket was a custom house seal; or a certified document given to a shipper as a warrant that his goods have been duly entered and have paid duty. Hence, in Scotland, there was an officer called the \"clerk of the cocket\". It may have given its name to cocket bread, which was perhaps stamped as though with a seal.\nDestruction.\nThe importance of the seal as a means of authentication necessitated that when authority passed into new hands the old seal should be destroyed and a new one made. When the pope dies it is the first duty of the Cardinal Camerlengo to obtain possession of the Ring of the Fisherman, the papal signet, and to see that it is broken up. A similar practice prevailed in the Middle Ages and it is often alluded to by historians, as it seems to have been a matter of some ceremony. For example, on the death of Robert of Holy Island, Bishop of Durham, in 1283, the chronicler Robert Greystones reports: \"After his burial, his seal was publicly broken up in the presence of all by Master Robert Avenel.\" Matthew Paris gives a similar description of the breaking of the seal of William of Trumpington, Abbot of St Albans, in 1235.\nThe practice is less widely attested in the case of medieval laypeople, but certainly occurred on occasion, particularly in the 13th and 14th centuries. Silver seal matrices have been found in the graves of some of the 12th-century queens of France. These were probably deliberately buried as a means of cancelling them.\nWhen King James II of England was dethroned in the Glorious Revolution of 1688/9, he is supposed to have thrown the Great Seal of the Realm into the River Thames before his flight to France in order to ensure that the machinery of government would cease to function. It is unclear how much truth there is to this story, but certainly the seal was recovered: James's successors, William III and Mary used the same Great Seal matrix, fairly crudely adapted \u2013 possibly quite deliberately, in order to demonstrate the continuity of government.\nSignet rings.\nA signet ring is a ring bearing on its flat top surface the equivalent of a seal. A typical signet ring has a design, often a family or personal crest, created in intaglio so that it will leave a raised (relief) impression of the design when the ring is pressed onto liquid sealing wax. The design is often made out of agate, carnelian, or sardonyx which tend not to bind with the wax. Most smaller classical engraved gems were probably originally worn as signet rings, or as seals on a necklace.\nThe wearing of signet rings (from Latin \"signum\" meaning \"sign\" or \"mark\") dates back to ancient Egypt: the seal of a pharaoh is mentioned in the Book of Genesis. Genesis 41:42: \"Removing his signet ring from his hand, Pharaoh put it on Joseph's hand; he arrayed him in garments of fine linen, and put a gold chain around his neck.\"\nBecause it is used to attest to the authority of its bearer, the ring has also been seen as a symbol of power, which is why it is included in the regalia of certain monarchies. After the death of a Pope, the destruction of his signet ring is a prescribed act clearing the way for the \"sede vacante\" and subsequent election of a new Pope.\nSignet rings are also used as a souvenir or membership attribute, e.g., class rings (which typically bear the coat of arms or crest of the school). One may also have their initials engraved as a sign of their personal stature. Traditionally, signet rings were worn either on the little or the ring finger of the least dominant hand, with the most common usage being on the little.\nThe less noble classes began wearing and using signet rings as early as the 13th century. In the 17th century, signet rings fell out of favor in the upper levels of society, replaced by other means for mounting and carrying the signet. In the 18th century, though, signet rings again became popular, and by the 19th century, men of all classes wore them.\nSince at least the 16th century there have also been pseudo-signet rings where the engraving is not reversed (mirror image), as it should be if the impression is to read correctly.\nRings have been used since antiquity as spy identification and in espionage. During World War II, US Air Force personnel would privately purchase signet rings with a hidden compartment that would hold a small compass or hidden message. MI9 purchased a number of signet rings from Regent Street jewelers that were used to conceal compasses.\nModern tamper-proofing.\nIn modern use, seals are used to tamper-proof equipment. For example, to prevent gas and electricity meters from being interfered with to show lower chargeable readings, they may be sealed with a lead or plastic seal with a government marking, typically fixed to a wire that passes through part of the meter housing. The meter cannot be opened without cutting the wire or damaging the seal.\nSpecially-made tamper-evident labels are available which are destroyed if the protected container or equipment is opened, functionally equivalent to a wax seal. They are used to protect things which must not be tampered with such as pharmaceuticals, equipment whose opening voids a manufacturer's warranty, etc.\nLegal provisions.\nSome jurisdictions consider rubber stamps or specified signature-accompanying words such as \"seal\" or \"L.S.\" (abbreviation of \"locus sigilli\", \"place of the seal\") to be the legal equivalent of, \"i.e.\", an equally effective substitute for, a seal.\nIn England and Wales, former rules of law which specified that a seal was needed for the valid execution of an instrument as a deed by an individual were abolished by section 1(1)(b) of the Law of Property (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1989. The Limitation Act 1980 specified limitation periods for contracts and certain other awards but retained existing provision relating to legal instruments made under seal.\nFigurative uses.\nApproval.\nThe expression \"seal of approval\" refers to a formal approval, regardless whether it involves a seal or other external marking, by an authoritative person or institute.\nIt is also part of the formal name of certain quality marks, such as:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It covers an area of \nand has a population of 2.17 million inhabitants, making it the 8th-largest state in Germany by area and the 11th-largest by population. Its capital and most populous city is Magdeburg.\nThe state of Saxony-Anhalt was formed in July 1945 after World War II, when the Soviet army administration in Allied-occupied Germany formed it from the former Prussian Province of Saxony and the Free State of Anhalt. Saxony-Anhalt became part of the German Democratic Republic in 1949, but was dissolved in 1952 during administrative reforms and its territory was divided into the districts of Halle and Magdeburg. Following German reunification, the state of Saxony-Anhalt was re-established in 1990 and became one of the new states of the Federal Republic of Germany.\nSaxony-Anhalt is renowned for its rich cultural heritage and possesses the highest concentration of UNESCO World Heritage sites in Germany.\nGeography.\nSaxony-Anhalt is one of 16 constituent states of Germany. It is located in the western part of eastern Germany. By size, it is the 8th largest state in Germany and by population, it is the 11th largest.\nIt borders four other states: Brandenburg to the north-east, Saxony to the south-east, Thuringia to the south-west and Lower Saxony to the north-west.\nIn the north, the Saxony-Anhalt landscape is dominated by the flat expanse of the North German Plain. The old Hanseatic towns Salzwedel, Gardelegen, Stendal and Tangerm\u00fcnde are located in the sparsely populated Altmark. The Colbitz-Letzlingen Heath and the Dr\u00f6mling near Wolfsburg mark the transition between the Altmark region and the Elbe-B\u00f6rde-Heath region with its fertile, sparsely wooded Magdeburg B\u00f6rde. Notable towns in the Magdeburg B\u00f6rde are Haldensleben, Oschersleben (Bode), Wanzleben, Sch\u00f6nebeck (Elbe), Aschersleben and the capital Magdeburg, from which the B\u00f6rde derives its name.\nThe Harz mountains are located in the south-west, comprising the Harz National Park, the Harz Foreland and Mansfeld Land. The highest mountain of the Harz (and of Northern Germany) is Brocken, with an elevation of 1,141 meters (3,735\u00a0ft). In this area, one can find the towns of Halberstadt, Wernigerode, Thale, Eisleben and Quedlinburg.\nThe wine-growing area Saale-Unstrut and the towns of Zeitz, Naumburg (Saale), Wei\u00dfenfels and Freyburg (Unstrut) are located on the rivers Saale and Unstrut in the south of the state.\nThe metropolitan area of Halle (Saale) forms an agglomeration with Leipzig in Saxony. This area is known for its highly developed chemical industry (the \"Chemiedreieck\" \u2013 chemical triangle), with major production plants at Leuna, Schkopau (\"Buna-Werke\") and Bitterfeld. Finally, in the east, Dessau-Ro\u00dflau and Wittenberg are situated on the Elbe (as is the capital Magdeburg) in the Anhalt-Wittenberg region.\nAdministrative subdivisions.\nThe capital and largest city of Saxony-Anhalt is Magdeburg. The second-largest city in the state is Halle (Saale). From 1994 to 2003, the state was divided into three regions (), Dessau, Halle and Magdeburg and, below the regional level, 21 districts (\"Landkreise\"). Since 2004, however, this system has been replaced by 11 rural districts and three urban districts.\nThe districts are:\nThe independent cities are:\nLargest towns.\nThe largest towns in Saxony-Anhalt as of 30 June 2022:\nHistory.\nSaxony-Anhalt is a federal state with a relatively short history, compared to other German federal states. It was formed in 1945 out of former Prussian territories and mainly consists of three distinct historical regions: the area around Magdeburg, the formerly independent Anhalt and a southern part which once was part of Saxony but had been annexed by Prussia in the 19th century. This historical origin can still be seen in the coat of arms of the federal state.\nIn April 1945 the US Army took control of most of the western and northern area of the future Saxony-Anhalt. The \"U.S. Group Control Council, Germany\" (a precursor of the OMGUS) appointed the first non-Nazi officials in leading positions in the area. Erhard H\u00fcbener, put on leave by the Nazis, was reappointed Landeshauptmann (state governor). By early July the US Army withdrew from the former Prussian Province of Saxony to make way for the Red Army to take it as part of the Soviet occupation zone, as agreed by the London Protocol in 1944.\nOn 9 July the Soviet SVAG ordered the merger of the Free State of Anhalt, Halle-Merseburg, the governorate of Magdeburg (in its then borders), Allstedt (before Thuringia) and some Brunswickian eastern exclaves and salients (Calv\u00f6rde and the eastern part of the former Blankenburg district) with the Province of Saxony. The previously Saxon Erfurt governorate had become a part of Thuringia.\n\"Anhalt\" takes its name from Anhalt Castle near Harzgerode; the origin of the name of the castle remains unknown. Anhalt was once an independent German federal state dating back centuries.\nThe SVAG appointed H\u00fcbener as president of the provincial Saxon administration, a newly created function. The administration was seated in Halle an der Saale, which became the capital, also of later Saxony-Anhalt until 1952. On 3 September 1945 the new administration enacted by Soviet-inspired ordinance the mass expropriations, mostly hitting holders of large real estates, often of noble descent.\nOn the occasion of the first (and one and only) election in the Soviet zone, allowing parties truly to compete for seats in provincial and state parliaments, on 20 October 1946, the Province of Saxony was renamed as the Province of Saxony-Anhalt (\"\"), taking the prior merger into account. On 3 December 1946 the members of the new provincial parliament elected H\u00fcbener the first minister-president of Saxony-Anhalt, with the votes of the CDU and Liberal Democratic Party of Germany (LDPD). Thus he became the only governor in the Soviet zone who was not a member of the communist Socialist Unity Party of Germany (SED), making him an inconvenience for the Soviet forces.\nAfter the official Allied decision to dissolve the Free State of Prussia, which had remained in limbo since the Prussian coup of 1932, its former provinces, in as far as they still existed, achieved statehood; thus the province emerged into the \"State of Saxony-Anhalt\" on 6 October 1947. It became part of the German Democratic Republic (East Germany) in 1949. From 1952 on, the East German states were dissolved, and Saxony-Anhalt's territory was divided into the East German districts of Halle and Magdeburg, except that the territory around Torgau was assigned to Leipzig. In 1990, in the course of German reunification, the districts were reintegrated as a state. The territory around Torgau did not return to the state and joined Saxony. Torgau is now the centre of the Nordsachsen district (since 2008).\nIn 2015 the skeletal remains of an ancient inhabitant of Karsdorf dated from the Early Neolithic (7200 BP) were analysed; he turned out to belong to the paternal T1a-M70 lineage and maternal lineage H1.\nDemographics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Module:Historical populations/styles.css\"/&gt;Since German reunification, there has been a continuous downward trend in the population of Saxony-Anhalt. This is partly due to outward migration and partly because the death rate exceeds the birth rate. Although the birth rate has been steady since 1994, the net reproduction rate is only approximately 70%. However, the total fertility rate reached 1.50 in 2014, the highest value since 1990.\nReligion.\nThe region has historically been associated with the Lutheran faith, but under Communist rule, church membership was strongly discouraged and much of the population disassociated itself from any religious body. Saxony-Anhalt contains many sites tied to Martin Luther's life, including Lutherstadt Eisleben and Lutherstadt Wittenberg.\nIn 2018, the majority of citizens in Saxony-Anhalt were irreligious and more were leaving the churches than entering them \u2013 in fact, Saxony-Anhalt is the most irreligious state in Germany. Of the Saxon-Anhaltish, 15.2% adhered to the major denominations of Christianity (11.9% were members of the Protestant Church in Germany and 3.3% were Catholics), 2% were members of other religions (mostly Islam, Judaism, the New Apostolic Church and Mandeism). Of the citizens of Saxony-Anhalt, 82.8% were religiously unaffiliated. As of July 2019 there were 1,892 Jehovah's Witnesses (publishers) in Sachsen-Anhalt. Originally their branch office for Germany was in Magdeburg. When World War II ended in 1945, the property in Magdeburg, then part of East Germany, was returned and the branch was reestablished. But on 30 August 1950 Communist police stormed the facilities and arrested the workers, and the Jehovah's Witnesses in the German Democratic Republic (DDR) were banned.\nForeigners.\nThe percentage of foreigners in Saxony-Anhalt was 4.9 percent by 31 December 2018, the third lowest among the 16 states of Germany (together with Saxony and Thuringia).\nThe largest foreign resident groups by 31 December 2022 were:\nPolitics.\n2021 state election.\nMinister-president Reiner Haseloff (CDU) retained his position in a coalition with former partner SPD and newly the FDP. Before the election the coalition had consisted of the CDU, SPD and Greens.\nEconomy.\nThe gross domestic product (GDP) of the state was 62.7 billion euros in 2018, which accounts for 1.9% of Germany's total economic output and ranks 13th among the 16 German states. GDP per capita adjusted for purchasing power was 26,000 euros or 86% of the EU27 average in the same year. The GDP per employee was 88% of the EU average. The GDP per capita was the second lowest of all German states. \nBy 2020, the GDP of the state dropped to 62.654 billion euros, shortly after reaching an all-time high of 64.115 billion euros in 2019.\nDevelopment.\nSaxony-Anhalt was part of the communist German Democratic Republic. After the breakdown of communism and the German reunification in 1990, the collapse of non-competitive former GDR industries temporarily caused severe economic problems. In 2000, Saxony-Anhalt had the highest unemployment rate of all German states, at 20.2%.\nHowever, the process of economic transformation towards a modern market economy seems to be completed. Massive investments in modern infrastructure have taken place since 1990, and the remaining and newly created businesses are highly competitive. For example, the industry has doubled its share of international revenue from 13 percent in 1995 to 26 percent in 2008. Meanwhile, the unemployment rate has fallen considerably. By 2010 the GDP of Saxony-Anhalt was almost two and a half times higher than it was in 1991.\nEven though part of this recovery was brought on by the positive performance of the German economy, Saxony-Anhalt not only followed the national trend, but clearly outperformed other German states. For example, it outperformed three German states in terms of unemployment (10.8%, as of September 2011): the German capital and city-state of Berlin (12.7%), the city-state Free Hanseatic City of Bremen (11.3%) and Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania (11%).\nThe unemployment began to fall under 10% in 2016, and stood at 7.1% in October 2018.\nTourism.\nSaxony-Anhalt has seven World Heritage Sites, the highest number of all states in Germany.\nTransport.\nThe region's international commercial airport is Leipzig/Halle Airport which provides flights to other parts of Germany and other European destinations. The airport also serves as the main European hub for cargo flights operated by DHL Aviation and the main hub for AeroLogic.\nEducation.\nSaxony-Anhalt has several universities, including:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Wide area networks are often established with leased telecommunication circuits.\nBusinesses, as well as schools and government entities, use wide area networks to relay data to staff, students, clients, buyers and suppliers from various locations around the world. In essence, this mode of telecommunication allows a business to effectively carry out its daily function regardless of location. The Internet may be considered a WAN. Many WANs are, however, built for one particular organization and are private. WANs can be separated from local area networks (LANs) in that the latter refers to physically proximal networks.\nDesign options.\nThe textbook definition of a WAN is a computer network spanning regions, countries, or even the world. However, in terms of the application of communication protocols and concepts, it may be best to view WANs as computer networking technologies used to transmit data over long distances, and between different networks. This distinction stems from the fact that common local area network (LAN) technologies operating at lower layers of the OSI model (such as the forms of Ethernet or Wi-Fi) are often designed for physically proximal networks, and thus cannot transmit data over tens, hundreds, or even thousands of miles or kilometres.\nWANs are used to connect LANs and other types of networks together so that users and computers in one location can communicate with users and computers in other locations. Many WANs are built for one particular organization and are private. Others, built by Internet service providers, provide connections from an organization's LAN to the Internet. \nWANs are often built using leased lines. At each end of the leased line, a router connects the LAN on one side with a second router within the LAN on the other. Because leased lines can be very expensive, instead of using leased lines, WANs can also be built using less costly circuit switching or packet switching methods. Network protocols, including TCP/IP, deliver transport and addressing functions. Protocols including Packet over SONET/SDH, Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS), Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) and Frame Relay are often used by service providers to deliver the links that are used in WANs. It is also possible to build a WAN with Ethernet.\nAcademic research into wide area networks can be broken down into three areas: mathematical models, network emulation, and network simulation. \nPerformance improvements are sometimes delivered via wide area file services or WAN optimization.\nPrivate networks.\nOf the approximately four billion addresses defined in IPv4, about 18 million addresses in three ranges are reserved for use in private networks. Packets addressed in these ranges are not routable on the public Internet; they are ignored by all public routers. Therefore, private hosts cannot directly communicate with public networks, but require network address translation at a routing gateway for this purpose.\n&lt;section begin=IPv4-private-networks/&gt;\n&lt;section end=IPv4-private-networks/&gt;\nSince two private networks, e.g., two branch offices, cannot directly communicate via the public Internet, the two networks must be bridged across the Internet via a virtual private network (VPN) or other form of IP tunnel that encapsulates packets, including their headers containing the private addresses, for transmission across the public network. Additionally, encapsulated packets may be encrypted to secure their data.\nConnection technology.\nMany technologies are available for wide-area network links. Examples include circuit-switched telephone lines, radio wave transmission, and optical fiber. New developments have successively increased transmission rates. In c.\u20091960, a line was normal on the edge of the WAN, while core links of 56 or 64 kbit/s were considered fast. Today, households are connected to the Internet with dial-up, asymmetric digital subscriber line (ADSL), cable, WiMAX, cellular network or fiber. The speeds that people can currently use range from 28.8 kbit/s through a 28K modem over a telephone connection to speeds as high as 100 Gbit/s using 100 Gigabit Ethernet.\nThe following communication and networking technologies have been used to implement WANs.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nAT&amp;T conducted trials in 2017 for business use of 400-gigabit Ethernet.

Christos Santis, graduate student Scott Steger, Amnon Yariv, Martin and Eileen Summerfield developed a new laser that potentially quadruples transfer speeds with fiber optics.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Wolpoff", "text": "American paleoanthropologist\nMilford Howell Wolpoff is a paleoanthropologist and professor of anthropology at the University of Michigan and its museum of Anthropology. He is the leading proponent of the multiregional evolution hypothesis that explains the evolution of \"Homo sapiens\" as a consequence of evolutionary processes and gene flow across continents within a single species. Wolpoff authored the widely used textbook \"Paleoanthropology\" (1980 and 1999 eds.), and co-authored \"Race and Human Evolution: A Fatal Attraction\", which reviews the scientific evidence and conflicting theories about the interpretation of human evolution, and biological anthropology's relationship to views about race.\nWolpoff is best known for his vocal support of the multiregional model of human evolution when it was challenged by the 'Out of Africa' theory. The basis for advancing the multiregional interpretation stems from his skepticism of punctuated equilibrium (the idea evolution typically proceeds with long static periods and abrupt changes, instead of gradual modification during speciation) as an accurate model for Pleistocene humanity, noting that speciation played a role earlier in human evolution.\nEducation.\nWolpoff was born in 1942 to Ruth (Silver) and Ben Wolpoff, in Chicago. He received an A.B. in 1964 with a major in anthropology and a minor in mathematics, and a PhD in 1969 in physical anthropology, with minors in zoology and archaeology, from the University of Illinois in Urbana, Illinois. His research advisor and intellectual mentor was Eugene Giles. He joined the faculty of the University of Michigan in 1971, and became a professor of anthropology in 1977.\nProfessional work.\nWolpoff was trained primarily as a paleoanthropologist at the University of Illinois under Eugene Giles. With his multidisciplinary training, he brings to the study of the human and non-human primate fossil record a background that combines evolutionary theory, population genetics, and biomechanics. With over 50 grants funded by the National Science Foundation, National Academy of Sciences, and the University of Michigan, Wolpoff has visited the museums where human and primate fossils are stored and has studied in detail and at length all the materials addressing the fossil evidence for human evolution across Europe, Asia, and Africa. His research foci have included the evolution and fate of the European Neandertals, the role of culture in early hominid evolution, the nature and explanation of allometry, robust australopithecine evolution, the distribution and explanation of sexual dimorphism, hominid origins, the pattern and explanation of Australasian hominid evolution, the contributions and role of genetics in paleoanthropological research, and the taxonomy of the genus \"Homo\". In addition, he is a primary describer of many hominid fossil remains. Since 1976 Wolpoff has graduated more than 20 PhD students. \nMultiregional evolution and the punctuated equilibrium theory.\nDrawing on this background and research experience, Wolpoff's continuing research in the last 15 years has been the development, articulation, and defense of his multiregional model of human evolution. He suggests that after an African origin of the Homo lineage (including \"Homo ergaster\"/\"Homo erectus\") and the subsequent migration of \"H. erectus\" throughout much of the globe (Africa, Europe, Asia), local evolutionary events took place, and when they were advantageous, they spread everywhere else. According to Wolpoff, populations of \"Homo\" evolved together as a single species. Change in Pleistocene populations did not involve speciation (the splitting of one species into two): all this time, the geographically distinct populations maintained small amounts of gene flow. This idea directly challenges the Out of Africa model, which claims \"Homo sapiens\" evolved recently as a new species in Africa, and then dispersed throughout the Old World, replacing the existing human populations without mixing with them.\nHis theory evoked rivalry with the proponents of punctuated equilibrium, Stephen Jay Gould and Niles Eldredge, who endorsed \"H. erectus\" as a model of their theory. In an earlier example of punctuated evolution preceding the global diffusion of \"Homo sapiens\" genes from Africa, some two million years ago, Wolpoff points to evidence of an earlier 'genetic revolution' that took place in a small group isolated from australopithecine forebears. \"The earliest \"H. sapiens\" remains differ significantly from australopithecines in both size and anatomical details,\" he notes, \"Insofar as we can tell, these changes were sudden and not gradual.\"\nAwards and honours.\nWolpoff is a member of many anthropological organizations, and is an Honorary Life Member of the Honor Society of Phi Kappa Phi, a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (in 2001) and Fellow of the American Anthropological Association.

Best known for its central role in helping develop the first atomic bomb, LANL is one of the world's largest and most advanced scientific institutions.\nLos Alamos was established in 1943 as Project Y, a top-secret site for designing nuclear weapons under the Manhattan Project during World War II. Chosen for its remote yet relatively accessible location, it served as the main hub for conducting and coordinating nuclear research, bringing together some of the world's most famous scientists, among them numerous Nobel Prize winners. The town of Los Alamos, directly north of the lab, grew extensively through this period.\nAfter the war ended in 1945, Project Y's existence was made public, and it became known universally as Los Alamos. In 1952, the Atomic Energy Commission formed a second design lab under the direction of the University of California, Berkeley, which became Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL). The two labs competed on a wide variety of bomb designs, but with the end of the Cold War, have focused increasingly on civilian missions. Today, Los Alamos conducts multidisciplinary research in fields such as national security, space exploration, nuclear fusion, renewable energy, medicine, nanotechnology, and supercomputing.\nWhile owned by the federal government, LANL is privately managed and operated by Triad National Security, LLC.\nHistory.\nThe Manhattan Project.\nThe laboratory was founded during World War II as a secret, centralized facility to coordinate the scientific research of the Manhattan Project, the Allied project to develop the first nuclear weapons. In September 1942, the difficulties encountered in conducting preliminary studies on nuclear weapons at universities scattered across the country indicated the need for a laboratory dedicated solely to that purpose.\nGeneral Leslie Groves wanted a central laboratory at an isolated location for safety, and to keep the scientists away from the populace. It should be at least 200 miles from international boundaries and west of the Mississippi. Major John Dudley suggested Oak City, Utah, or Jemez Springs, New Mexico, but both were rejected. Jemez Springs was only a short distance from the current site. Project Y director J. Robert Oppenheimer had spent much time in his youth in the New Mexico area and suggested the Los Alamos Ranch School on the mesa. Dudley had rejected the school as not meeting Groves' criteria, but as soon as Groves saw it he said in effect \"This is the place.\" Oppenheimer became the laboratory's first director; from 19 October 1942.\nDuring the Manhattan Project, Los Alamos hosted thousands of employees, including many Nobel Prize-winning scientists. The location was a total secret. Its only mailing address was a post office box, number 1663, in Santa Fe, New Mexico. Eventually two other post office boxes were used, 180 and 1539, also in Santa Fe. Though its contract with the University of California was initially intended to be temporary, the relationship was maintained long after the war. Until the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Japan, University of California president Robert Sproul did not know what the purpose of the laboratory was and thought it might be producing a \"death ray.\" The only member of the UC administration who knew its true purpose\u2014indeed, the only one who knew its exact physical location\u2014was the Secretary-Treasurer Robert Underhill (younger brother of Marine Corps general James Underhill and Army colonel Lewis Underhill), who was in charge of wartime contracts and liabilities. He first visited the site in mid-March 1943 and was informed of the project objective by Ernest Lawrence in November 1943.\nThe work of the laboratory culminated in several atomic devices, one of which was used in the first nuclear test near Alamogordo, New Mexico, codenamed \"Trinity,\" on July 16, 1945. The other two were weapons, \"Little Boy\" and \"Fat Man,\" which were used in the attacks on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The Laboratory received the Army-Navy \"E\" Award for Excellence in production on October 16, 1945.\nPost-war.\nAfter the war, Oppenheimer retired from the directorship, and it was taken over by Norris Bradbury, whose initial mission was to make the previously hand-assembled atomic bombs \"G.I. proof\" so that they could be mass-produced and used without the assistance of highly trained scientists. Other founding members of Los Alamos left the laboratory and became outspoken opponents to the further development of nuclear weapons.\nThe name officially changed to the Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory (LASL) on January 1, 1947. By this time, Argonne had already been made the first National Laboratory the previous year. Los Alamos would not become a National Laboratory in name until 1981.\nIn the years since the 1940s, Los Alamos was responsible for the development of the hydrogen bomb, and many other variants of nuclear weapons. In 1952, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory was founded to act as Los Alamos' \"competitor,\" with the hope that two laboratories for the design of nuclear weapons would spur innovation. Los Alamos and Livermore served as the primary classified laboratories in the U.S. national laboratory system, designing all the country's nuclear arsenal. Additional work included basic scientific research, particle accelerator development, health physics, and fusion power research as part of Project Sherwood. Many nuclear tests were undertaken in the Marshall Islands and at the Nevada Test Site. During the late-1950s, a number of scientists including Dr. J. Robert \"Bob\" Beyster left Los Alamos to work for General Atomics (GA) in San Diego.\nThree major nuclear-related accidents have occurred at LANL. Criticality accidents occurred in August 1945 and May 1946, and a third accident occurred during an annual physical inventory in December 1958.\nSeveral buildings associated with the Manhattan Project at Los Alamos were declared a National Historic Landmark in 1965.\nPost-Cold War.\nAt the end of the Cold War, both labs went through a process of intense scientific diversification in their research programs to adapt to the changing political conditions that no longer required as much research towards developing new nuclear weapons and has led the lab to increase research for \"non-war\" science and technology. Los Alamos' nuclear work is currently thought to relate primarily to computer simulations and stockpile stewardship. The development of the Dual-Axis Radiographic Hydrodynamic Test Facility will allow complex simulations of nuclear tests to take place without full explosive yields.\nThe laboratory contributed to the early development of the flow cytometry technology. In the 1950s, researcher Mack Fulwyler developed a technique for sorting erythrocytes that combined the Coulter Principle of Coulter counter technologies, which measures the presence of cells and their size, with ink jet technology, which produces a laminar flow of liquid that breaks up into separate, fine drops. In 1969, Los Alamos reported the first fluorescence detector apparatus, which accurately measured the number and size of ovarian cells and blood cells.\nAs of 2017, other research performed at the lab included developing cheaper, cleaner biofuels and advancing scientific understanding around renewable energy.\nNon-nuclear national security and defense development is also a priority at the lab. This includes preventing outbreaks of deadly diseases by improving detection tools and the monitoring the effectiveness of the United States' vaccine distribution infrastructure. Additional advancements include the ASPECT airplane that can detect bio threats from the sky.\nMedical work.\nIn 2008, development for a safer, more comfortable and accurate test for breast cancer was ongoing by scientists Lianjie Huang and Kenneth M. Hanson and collaborators. The new technique, called ultrasound-computed tomography (ultrasound CT), uses sound waves to accurately detect small tumors that traditional mammography cannot.\nThe lab has made intense efforts for humanitarian causes through its scientific research in medicine. In 2010, three vaccines for the Human Immunodeficiency Virus were being tested by lab scientist Bette Korber and her team. \"These vaccines might finally deal a lethal blow to the AIDS virus\", says Chang-Shung Tung, leader of the Lab's Theoretical Biology and Biophysics group.\nNegative publicity.\nThe laboratory has attracted negative publicity from a number of events. In 1999, Los Alamos scientist Wen Ho Lee was accused of 59 counts of mishandling classified information by downloading nuclear secrets\u2014\"weapons codes\" used for computer simulations of nuclear weapons tests\u2014to data tapes and removing them from the lab. After ten months in jail, Lee pleaded guilty to a single count of unauthorized possession of documents, but the other 58 were dismissed with an apology from U.S. District Judge James Parker for his incarceration. Lee had been suspected for having shared U.S. nuclear secrets with China, but investigators were never able to establish what Lee did with the downloaded data.\nIn 2000, two computer hard drives containing classified data were announced to have gone missing from a secure area within the laboratory, but were later found behind a photocopier.\nScience mission.\nLos Alamos National Laboratory's mission is to \"solve national security challenges through simultaneous excellence\". The laboratory's strategic plan reflects U.S. priorities spanning nuclear security, intelligence, defense, emergency response, nonproliferation, counterterrorism, energy security, emerging threats, and environmental management. This strategy is aligned with priorities set by the Department of Energy (DOE), the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA), and national strategy guidance documents, such as the Nuclear Posture Review, the National Security Strategy, and the Blueprint for a Secure Energy Future.\nLos Alamos is the senior laboratory in the DOE system, and executes work in all areas of the DOE mission: national security, science, energy, and environmental management. The laboratory also performs work for the Department of Defense (DoD), Intelligence Community (IC), and Department of Homeland Security (DHS), among others. The laboratory's multidisciplinary scientific capabilities and activities are organized into six Capability Pillars:\nLos Alamos operates three main user facilities:\nAs of 2017, the Los Alamos National Laboratory is using data and algorithms to possibly protect public health by tracking the growth of infectious diseases. Digital epidemiologists at the lab's Information Systems and Modeling group are using clinical surveillance data, Google search queries, census data, Wikipedia, and even tweets to create a system that could predict epidemics. The team is using data from Brazil as its model; Brazil was notably threatened by the Zika virus as it prepared to host the Summer Olympics in 2016.\nLaboratory management and operations.\nWithin LANL's 35-square-mile property are approximately 2,000 dumpsites which have contaminated the environment. It also contributed to thousands of dumpsites at 108 locations in 29 US states.\nContract changes.\nContinuing efforts to make the laboratory more efficient led the Department of Energy to open its contract with the University of California to bids from other vendors in 2003. Though the university and the laboratory had difficult relations many times since their first World War II contract, this was the first time that the university ever had to compete for management of the laboratory. The University of California decided to create a private company with the Bechtel Corporation, Washington Group International, and the BWX Technologies to bid on the contract to operate the laboratory. The UC/Bechtel led corporation\u2014Los Alamos National Security, LLC (LANS)\u2014was pitted against a team formed by the University of Texas System partnered with Lockheed-Martin. In December 2005, the Department of Energy announced that LANS had won the next seven-year contract to manage and operate the laboratory.\nOn June 1, 2006, the University of California ended its sixty years of direct involvement in operating Los Alamos National Laboratory, and management control of the laboratory was taken over by Los Alamos National Security, LLC with effect October 1, 2007. Approximately 95% of the former 10,000 plus UC employees at LANL were rehired by LANS to continue working at LANL. Other than UC appointing three members to the eleven member board of directors that oversees LANS, UC now has virtually no responsibility or direct involvement in LANL. UC policies and regulations that apply to UC campuses and its two national laboratories in California (Lawrence Berkeley and Lawrence Livermore) no longer apply to LANL, and the LANL director no longer reports to the UC Regents or UC Office of the President.\nOn June 8, 2018, the NNSA announced that Triad National Security, LLC, a joint venture between Battelle Memorial Institute, the University of California, and Texas A&amp;M University, would assume operation and management of LANL beginning November 1, 2018.\nSafety management.\nIn August 2011, the close placement of eight plutonium rods for a photo nearly led to a criticality incident. The photo shoot, which was directed by the laboratory's management, was one of several factors relating to unsafe management practices that led to the departure of 12 of the lab's 14 safety staff. The criticality incident was one of several that led the Department of Energy to seek alternative bids to manage the laboratory after the 2018 expiration of the LANS contract.\nThe lab was penalized with a $57\u00a0million reduction in its 2014 budget over the February 14, 2014, accident at the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant for which it was partly responsible.\nIn August 2017, the improper storage of plutonium metal could have triggered a criticality accident, and subsequently staff failed to declare the failure as required by procedure.\nLANL surveys the air, soil, sediment, groundwater, and surface water surrounding the Laboratory to ensure that contaminants from these operations do not pose problems to workers or the public. LANL contracted with Locus Technologies to build its Intellus NM database to make the results of environmental monitoring activities accessible to the public.\nExtended operations.\nWith support of the National Science Foundation, LANL operates one of the three National High Magnetic Field Laboratories in conjunction with and located at two other sites Florida State University in Tallahassee, Florida, and University of Florida in Gainesville, Florida.\nLos Alamos National Laboratory is a partner in the Joint Genome Institute (JGI) located in Walnut Creek, California. JGI was founded in 1997 to unite the expertise and resources in genome mapping, DNA sequencing, technology development, and information sciences pioneered at the three genome centers at University of California's Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL), Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), and LANL.\nThe Integrated Computing Network (ICN) is a multi-security level network at the LANL integrating large host supercomputers, a file server, a batch server, a printer and graphics output server and numerous other general purpose and specialized systems. IBM Roadrunner, which was part of this network, was the first supercomputer to hit petaflop speeds.\nUntil 1999, The Los Alamos National Laboratory hosted the arXiv e-print archive. The arXiv is currently operated and funded by Cornell University.\nThe coreboot project was initially developed at LANL.\nIn the recent years, the Laboratory has developed a major research program in systems biology modeling, known at LANL under the name q-bio.\nSeveral serials are published by LANL:\nLANL also published \"Los Alamos Science\" from 1980 to 2005, as well as the \"Nuclear Weapons Journal\", which was replaced by \"National Security Science\" after two issues in 2009.\nControversy and criticism.\nIn 2005, Congress held new hearings on lingering security issues at Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico; documented problems continued to be ignored.\nIn November 2008, a drum containing nuclear waste was ruptured due to a 'deflagration' according to an inspector general report of the Dept. of Energy, which due to lab mistakes, also occurred in 2014 at the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant near Carlsbad, New Mexico with significant disruptions and costs across the industry.\nIn 2009, 69 computers which did not contain classified information were lost. The same year also saw a scare in which 1\u00a0kg (2.2\u00a0lb) of missing plutonium prompted a Department of Energy investigation into the laboratory. The investigation found that the \"missing plutonium\" was a result of miscalculation by LANL's statisticians and did not actually exist; but the investigation did lead to heavy criticism of the laboratory by the DOE for security flaws and weaknesses that the DOE claimed to have found.\nInstitutional statistics.\nLANL is northern New Mexico's largest institution and the largest employer which had in 2025 approximately 13,200 direct employees, 330 guard force, 620 contractors, 1,800 students, 1,200 unionized craft workers, and 460 post-doctoral researchers. Additionally, there are roughly 120 DOE employees stationed at the laboratory to provide federal oversight of LANL's work and operations. Approximately one-third of the laboratory's technical staff members are physicists, one-quarter are engineers, one-sixth are chemists and materials scientists, and the remainder work in mathematics and computational science, biology, geoscience, and other disciplines. Professional scientists and students also come to Los Alamos as visitors to participate in scientific projects. The staff collaborates with universities and industry in both basic and applied research to develop resources for the future. The annual budget is approximately US$4.9 billion.\nDirectors.\nThe following persons served as director of the Los Alamos National Laboratory:\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Founded in 1943, the laboratory is sponsored by the United States Department of Energy and administered by UT\u2013Battelle, LLC.\nEstablished in 1943, ORNL is the largest science and energy national laboratory in the Department of Energy system by size and third largest by annual budget. It is located in the Roane County section of Oak Ridge. Its scientific programs focus on materials, nuclear science, neutron science, energy, high-performance computing, environmental science, systems biology and national security, sometimes in partnership with the state of Tennessee, universities and other industries.\nORNL has several of the world's top supercomputers, including Frontier, ranked by the TOP500 as the world's second most powerful. The lab is a neutron and nuclear power research facility that includes the Spallation Neutron Source, the High Flux Isotope Reactor, and the Center for Nanophase Materials Sciences.\nOverview.\nOak Ridge National Laboratory is managed by UT\u2013Battelle, a limited liability partnership between the University of Tennessee and the Battelle Memorial Institute, formed in 2000 for that purpose. The annual budget is US$2.4\u00a0billion. As of 2021 there is a staff of 5,700 working at ORNL, around 2,000 of whom are scientists and engineers, and an additional 3,200 guest researchers annually.\nThere are five campuses on the Department of Energy's Oak Ridge reservation: the National Laboratory, the Y-12 National Security Complex, the East Tennessee Technology Park (formerly the Oak Ridge Gaseous Diffusion Plant), the Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education, and the developing Oak Ridge Science and Technology Park, although the four other facilities are unrelated to the National Laboratory. The total area of the reservation is 150\u00a0square\u00a0kilometres (58\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) of which the lab takes up 18\u00a0square\u00a0kilometres (7\u00a0sq\u00a0mi).\nHistory.\nIn 1934 the Freel Farm Mound Site, an archaeological site and burial mound of the Late Woodland period was excavated. The site is currently inundated by Melton Hill Lake.\nThe city of Oak Ridge was established by the Army Corps of Engineers as part of the Clinton Engineer Works in 1942 on isolated farm land as part of the Manhattan Project. During World War II, advanced research for the government was managed at the site by the University of Chicago's Metallurgical Laboratory. In 1943, construction of the Clinton Laboratories, what would later be known as the Oak Ridge National Laboratory, was completed. The site was chosen for the X-10 Graphite Reactor, used to produce plutonium from natural uranium. Enrico Fermi and his colleagues developed the world's second self-sustaining nuclear reactor after Fermi's previous experiment, the Chicago Pile-1. The X-10 was the first reactor designed for continuous operation.\nAfter the end of World War II, management of the lab was contracted by the US government to Monsanto; however, they withdrew in 1947. The University of Chicago temporarily re-assumed responsibility, with the site receiving the prestigious \"National\" laboratory designation, until in December 1947, when Union Carbide and Carbon Co., which already operated two other facilities at Oak Ridge, took control of the laboratory and renamed the site Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL).\nPost-war, the demand for military science had fallen dramatically, and the future of the lab was uncertain. The X-10 reactor and the laboratory's 1,000 employees were no longer involved in nuclear weapons. Instead, it was used for scientific research. In 1946 the first medical isotopes were produced in the X-10 reactor, and by 1950 almost 20,000 samples had been shipped to various hospitals. The quantity and variety of radionuclides produced by X-10 for medicine grew steadily in the 1950s. ORNL was the only Western source of californium-252. ORNL scientists also performed the world's first successful bone marrow transplant in mice by suppressing their immune systems.\nIn 1950 the Oak Ridge School of Reactor Technology was established with two courses in reactor operation and safety; almost 1,000 students graduated. Much of the research performed at ORNL in the 1950s was related to nuclear reactors as a form of energy production, both for propulsion and electricity. More reactors were built in the 1950s than in the rest of the ORNL's history combined. One of their most influential projects was the light-water reactor, a precursor to many modern nuclear power stations. The US Military funded much of its development, for nuclear-powered submarines and ships of the US Navy. The US Army also contracted the design of portable nuclear reactors in 1953 for heat and electricity generation in remote military bases. The reactors were produced by the American Locomotive Company and used in Greenland, the Panama Canal Zone, and Antarctica. The US Air Force also contributed funding to three reactors, the lab's first computers, and its first particle accelerators. ORNL built its first molten salt reactor in 1954 as a proof-of-concept for a proposed fleet of long-range bombers, but it was never used.Alvin M. Weinberg was named Director of Research, ORNL, and in 1955 Director of the Laboratory. In the early 1960s there was a large push at ORNL to develop nuclear-powered desalination plants, where deserts met the sea, to provide water. The project, called Water for Peace, was backed by John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson and was presented at a 1964 United Nations conference, but increases in the cost of construction and falling public confidence in nuclear power caused the plan to be shuttered. The Health Physics Research Reactor built in 1962 was used for radiation exposure experiments leading to more accurate dosage limits and dosimeters, and improved radiation shielding.\nIn 1964 the Molten-Salt Reactor Experiment began with the construction of the reactor. It operated from 1966 until 1969 (with six months down time to move from U-235 to U-233 fuel) and proved the viability of molten salt reactors, while also producing fuel for other reactors as a byproduct of its own reaction. The High Flux Isotope Reactor built in 1965 had the highest neutron flux of any reactor at the time. It improved upon the work of the X-10 reactor, producing more medical isotopes as well as allowing higher fidelity of materials research. Researchers in the biology division studied the effects of chemicals on mice, including petrol fumes, pesticides, and tobacco. \nIn the late 1960s, cuts in funding led to the cancellation of plans for another particle accelerator, and the United States Atomic Energy Commission cut the breeder reactor program by two-thirds, leading to a downsizing in staff from 5,000 to 3,800. In the 1970s, the prospect of fusion power was strongly considered, sparking research at ORNL. A tokamak called ORMAK, made operational in 1971, was the first tokamak to achieve a plasma temperature of 20 million Kelvin. After the success of the fusion experiments, it was enlarged and renamed ORMAK II in 1973; however, the experiments ultimately failed to lead to fusion power plants.\nThe US Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) required improved safety standards in the early 1970s for nuclear reactors, so ORNL staff wrote almost 100 requirements covering many factors including fuel transport and earthquake resistance. In 1972 the AEC held a series of public hearings where emergency cooling requirements were highlighted and the safety requirements became more stringent. Also in 1972, Peter Mazur, a biologist at ORNL, froze with liquid nitrogen, thawed and implanted mouse embryos in a surrogate mother. The mouse pups were born healthy. The technique is popular in the livestock industry, as it allows the embryos of valuable cattle to be transported easily and a prize cow can have multiple eggs extracted and thus, through \"in vitro\" fertilisation, have many more offspring than would naturally be possible.\nIn 1974 Alvin Weinberg, director of the lab for 19 years, was replaced by Herman Postma, a fusion scientist. In 1977 construction began for 6\u00a0metre (20\u00a0foot) superconducting electromagnets, intended to control fusion reactions. The project was an international effort: three electromagnets were produced in the US, one in Japan, one in Switzerland and the final by remaining European states. ORNL was involved in analyzing the damage to the core of the Three Mile Island Nuclear Generating Station after the accident in 1979. \nThe 1980s brought more changes to ORNL: a focus on efficiency became paramount. An accelerated climate simulation chamber was built that applied varying weather conditions to insulation to test its efficacy and durability faster than real time. Materials research into heat resistant ceramics for use in truck and high-tech car engines was performed, building upon the materials research that began in the nuclear reactors of the 1950s. In 1987 the High Temperature Materials Laboratory was established, where ORNL and industry researchers cooperated on ceramic and alloy projects. The materials research budget at ORNL doubled after initial uncertainty regarding Reagan's economic policy of less government expenditure. In 1981, the Holifield Heavy Ion Research Facility, a 25\u00a0MV particle accelerator, was opened at ORNL. At the time, Holifield had the widest range of ion species and was twice as powerful as other accelerators, attracting hundreds of guest researchers each year.\nThe Department of Energy was concerned with the pollution surrounding ORNL, and it began clean-up efforts. Burial trenches and leaking pipes had contaminated the groundwater beneath the lab, and radiation tanks were sitting idle, full of waste. Estimates of the total cost of clean-up were into the hundreds of millions of US dollars. The five older reactors were subjected to safety reviews in 1987, ordered to be deactivated until the reviews were complete. By 1989 when the High Flux Isotope Reactor was restarted, the US supply of certain medical isotopes was depleted. In 1989 the former executive officer of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, Alvin Trivelpiece, became director of ORNL; he remained in the role until 2000.\nIn 1992 whistleblower Charles Varnadore filed complaints against ORNL, alleging safety violations and retaliation by his superiors. While an administrative law judge ruled in Varnadore's favor, Secretary of Labor Robert Reich overturned that ruling. However, Varnadore's case saw prime contractor Martin Marietta cited for safety violations and ultimately led to additional whistleblower protection within DOE.\nIn January 2019 ORNL announced a major breakthrough in its capacity to automate Pu-238 production which helped push annual production from 50 grams to 400 grams, moving closer to NASA's goal of 1.5 kilograms per year by 2025 in order to sustain its space exploration programs.\nAreas of research.\nORNL conducts research and development activities that span a wide range of scientific disciplines. Many research areas have a significant overlap with each other; researchers often work in two or more of the fields listed here. The laboratory's major research areas are described briefly below.\nEnergy.\nThe laboratory has a long history of energy research; nuclear reactor experiments have been conducted since the end of World War II in 1945. Because of the availability of reactors and high-performance computing resources, an emphasis on improving the efficiency of nuclear reactors is present. The programs develop more efficient materials, more accurate simulations of aging reactor cores, sensors and controls as well as safety procedures for regulatory authorities.\nThe Energy Efficiency and Electricity Technologies Program aims to improve air quality in the US and reduce dependence on foreign oil supplies. There are three key areas of research: electricity, manufacturing and mobility. The electricity division focuses on reducing electricity consumption and finding alternative sources for production. Buildings, which account for 39% of US electricity consumption as of 2012, are a key area of research as the program aims to create affordable, carbon-neutral homes. Research also takes place into higher efficiency solar panels, geothermal electricity and heating, lower cost wind generators, and the economic and environmental feasibility of potential hydro power plants.\nThe Fusion Energy Division pursues short-term goals to develop components such as high-temperature superconductors, high-speed hydrogen pellet injectors, and suitable materials for future fusion research. Much research into the behaviour and maintenance of plasma takes place at the Fusion Energy Division to further the understanding of plasma physics, a crucial area for developing a fusion power plant. The US ITER office is at ORNL with partners at Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory and Savannah River National Laboratory. The US contribution to the ITER project is 9.1% which is expected to be in excess of US$1.6\u00a0billion throughout the contract. ORNL researchers participated in developing of an extensive research plan for the US-ITER collaboration detailed in 2022.\nBiology.\nBiological research covers ecology, forestry, genomics, computational biology, structural biology and bioinformatics. The BioEnergy Program aims to improve the efficiency of all stages of the biofuel process to improve the energy security of the United States. The program aims to make genetic improvements to the potential biomass used, formulate methods for refineries that can accept a diverse range of fuels, and to improve the efficiency of energy delivery both to power plants and end users.\nThe Center for Molecular Biophysics conducts research into the behaviour of biological molecules in various conditions. The center hosts projects that examine cell walls for biofuel production, use neutron scattering to analyze protein folding, and simulate the effect of catalysis on a conventional and quantum scale. ORNL is home to a field site for the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON), which has a field office nearby. The Department of Energy works closely with the Tennessee Wildlife Resources Agency out of ORNL to monitor forest ecology for the surrounding Appalachians &amp; Cumberland Plateau Domain of NEON.\nNeutron science.\nThere are two neutron sources at ORNL; the High Flux Isotope Reactor (HFIR) and the Spallation Neutron Source (SNS). HFIR provides neutrons in a stable beam resulting from a constant nuclear reaction whereas SNS, a particle accelerator, produces pulses of neutrons. HFIR went critical in 1965 and has been used for materials research and as a major source of medical radioisotopes since. As of 2013, HFIR provides the world's highest constant neutron flux as a result of various upgrades. Berkelium-249, used to synthesize tennessine for the first time, was produced in the HFIR as part of an international effort. HFIR is likely to operate until approximately 2060 before the reactor pressure vessel is considered unsafe for continued use.\nThe SNS has the highest intensity neutron pulses of any human-made neutron source. SNS was made operational in 2006 and has since been upgraded to 1\u00a0megawatt with plans to continue up to 3\u00a0MW. High-power neutron pulses permit clearer images of the targets, meaning smaller samples can be analyzed and accurate results require fewer pulses.\nMaterials.\nBetween 2002 and 2008 ORNL partnered with Caterpillar Inc. to develop a new steel for their diesel engines that can withstand large temperature fluctuations. The new material, named CF8C Plus, is based on conventional CF8C stainless steel with added manganese and nitrogen; the result has better high\u2013temperature properties and is easier to cast at a similar cost. In 2003 the partners received an R&amp;D 100 award from \"R&amp;D magazine\" and in 2009 received an award for \"excellence in technology transfer\" from the Federal Laboratory Consortium for the commercialization of the steel.\nThere is a high-temperature materials lab at ORNL that permits researchers from universities, private companies and other government initiatives to use their facilities. As is the case for all designated user facilities, the resources of the High Temperature Materials Laboratory are available for free if the results are published; private research is permitted but requires payment.\nThe Center for Nanophase Materials Sciences (CNMS) researches the behaviour and fabrication of nanomaterials. The center emphasises discovery of new materials and the understanding of underlying physical and chemical interactions that enable creation of nanomaterials. In 2012, CNMS produced a lithium-sulfide battery with a theoretical energy density three to five times greater than existing lithium ion batteries.\nSecurity.\nORNL provides resources to the United States Department of Homeland Security and other defense programs. The Global Security and Nonproliferation (GS&amp;N) program develops and implements policies, both US based and international, to prevent the proliferation of nuclear material. The program has developed safeguards for nuclear arsenals, guidelines for dismantling arsenals, plans of action should nuclear material fall into unauthorised hands, detection methods for stolen or missing nuclear material, and trade of nuclear material between the US and Russia. The GS&amp;N's work overlaps with that of the Homeland Security Programs Office, providing detection of nuclear material and nonproliferation guidelines. Other areas concerning the Department Homeland Security include nuclear and radiological forensics, chemical and biological agent detection using mass spectrometry, and simulations of potential national hazards.\nHigh-performance computing.\nORNL has been the site of various supercomputers, home to the fastest on several occasions. In 1953, ORNL partnered with the Argonne National Laboratory to build ORACLE (Oak Ridge Automatic Computer and Logical Engine), a computer to research nuclear physics, chemistry, biology, and engineering. ORACLE had 2048\u00a0words (80\u00a0Kibit) of memory and took approximately 590\u00a0microseconds to perform addition or multiplication of integers. In the 1960s ORNL was equipped with an IBM 360/91 and an IBM 360/65. In 1995 ORNL bought an Intel Paragon based computer called the \"Intel Paragon XP/S 150\" that performed at 154\u00a0gigaFLOPS and ranked third on the TOP500 list of supercomputers. In 2005 Jaguar was built, a Cray XT3-based system that performed at 25\u00a0teraFLOPS and received incremental upgrades up to the XT5 platform that performed at 2.3\u00a0petaFLOPS in 2009. It was recognised as the world's fastest from November 2009 until November 2010. Summit was built for Oak Ridge National Laboratory during 2018, which benchmarked at 122.3 petaFLOPS. As of June 2020, Summit was the world's second fastest [clocked] supercomputer with 202,752 CPU cores, 27,648 Nvidia Tesla GPUs, and 250 Petabytes of storage, having lost the top position to the Japanese Fugaku supercomputer. In May 2022, the ORNL Frontier system broke the exascale barrier, achieving 1.102 exaflop/s using 8,730,112 cores.\nSince 1992 the Center for Computational Sciences has overseen high performance computing at ORNL.

The central theme is redemption through love. Wagner conducted the premiere at the K\u00f6nigliches Hoftheater Dresden in 1843. \nWagner claimed in his 1870 autobiography \"Mein Leben\" that he had been inspired to write the opera following a stormy sea crossing he made from Riga to London in July and August 1839. In his 1843 \"Autobiographic Sketch\", Wagner acknowledged he had taken the story from Heinrich Heine's retelling of the legend in his 1833 satirical novel \"The Memoirs of Mister von Schnabelewopski\" (\"Aus den Memoiren des Herrn von Schnabelewopski\").\nThis work shows early attempts at operatic styles that would characterise his later music dramas. In \"Der fliegende Holl\u00e4nder\" Wagner uses a number of leitmotifs (literally, \"leading motifs\") associated with the characters and themes. The leitmotifs are all introduced in the overture, which begins with a well-known ocean or storm motif before moving into the Dutchman and Senta motifs.\nWagner originally wrote the work to be performed without intermission \u2013 an example of his efforts to break with tradition \u2013 and, while today's opera houses often still follow this directive, it is also performed in the published three-act version.\nThe autograph manuscript of the opera is preserved in the Richard Wagner Foundation.\nComposition history.\nAt the beginning of 1839, the 26-year-old Richard Wagner was employed as a conductor at the Court Theatre in Riga. His extravagant lifestyle plus the retirement from the stage of his actress wife, Minna Planer, caused him to run up huge debts that he was unable to repay. Wagner was writing \"Rienzi\" and hatched a plan to flee his creditors in Riga, escape to Paris via London and make his fortune by putting \"Rienzi\" on to the stage of the Paris Op\u00e9ra. However, this plan quickly turned to disaster: his passport having been seized by the authorities on behalf of his creditors, he and Minna had to make a dangerous and illegal crossing over the Prussian border, during which Minna suffered a miscarriage. Boarding the ship \"Thetis\", whose captain had agreed to take them without passports, their sea journey was hindered by storms and high seas. The ship at one point took refuge in the Norwegian fjords at Tvedestrand, and a trip that was expected to take eight days finally delivered Wagner to London three weeks after leaving Riga.\nWagner's experience of Paris was also disastrous. He was unable to get work as a conductor, and the \"Op\u00e9ra\" did not want to produce \"Rienzi\". The Wagners were reduced to poverty, relying on handouts from friends and from the little income that Wagner could make writing articles on music and copying scores. Wagner hit on the idea of a one-act opera on the theme of the \"Flying Dutchman\", which he hoped might be performed before a ballet at the \"Op\u00e9ra\".\nThe voyage through the Norwegian reefs made a wonderful impression on my imagination; the legend of the Flying Dutchman, which the sailors verified, took on a distinctive, strange colouring that only my sea adventures could have given it.\nWagner wrote the first prose draft of the story in Paris early in May 1840, basing the story on Heinrich Heine's satire \"The Memoirs of Mister von Schnabelewopski\" (\"Aus den Memoiren des Herrn von Schnabelewopski\") published in \"Der Salon\" in 1834. In Heine's tale, the narrator watches a performance of a fictitious stage play on the theme of the sea captain cursed to sail forever for blasphemy. Heine introduces the character as a Wandering Jew of the ocean, and also added the device taken up so vigorously by Wagner in this, and many subsequent operas: the Dutchman can only be redeemed by the love of a faithful woman. In Heine's version, this is presented as a means for ironic humour; however, Wagner took this theme literally and in his draft, the woman is faithful until death.\nBy the end of May 1841 Wagner had completed the libretto or \"poem\" as he preferred to call it. Composition of the music had begun during May to July of the previous year, 1840, when Wagner wrote Senta's Ballad, the Norwegian Sailors' song in act 3 (\"\") and the subsequent Phantom song of the Dutchman's crew in the same scene. These were composed for an audition at the Paris \"Op\u00e9ra\", along with the sketch of the plot. Wagner actually sold the sketch to the Director of the \"Op\u00e9ra\", L\u00e9on Pillet, for 500 francs, but was unable to convince him that the music was worth anything. Wagner composed the rest of the \"Der fliegende Holl\u00e4nder\" during the summer of 1841, with the Overture being written last, and by November 1841 the orchestration of the score was complete. While this score was designed to be played continuously in a single act, Wagner later divided the piece into a three-act work. In doing so, however, he did not alter the music significantly, but merely interrupted transitions that had originally been crafted to flow seamlessly (the original one-act layout is restored in some performances).\nIn his original draft Wagner set the action in Scotland, but he changed the location to Norway shortly before the first production staged in Dresden and conducted by himself in January 1843.\nIn his essay \"A Communication to My Friends\" in 1851, Wagner claimed that \"The Dutchman\" represented a new start for him: \"From here begins my career as poet, and my farewell to the mere concoctor of opera-texts.\" Indeed - until \"Rienzi\" is staged there in 2026 - the opera has been the earliest of Wagner's works performed at the Bayreuth Festival and, at least for that theatre, has traditionally marked the start of the mature Wagner canon.\nInstrumentation.\n\"Der fliegende Holl\u00e4nder\" is scored for the following instruments:\n\"on-stage\"\nPlace: On the coast of Norway\nSynopsis.\nAct 1.\nOn his homeward journey, the sea captain Daland is compelled by stormy weather to seek a port of refuge near Sandwike in southern Norway. He leaves the helmsman on watch and he and the sailors retire. (Song of the helmsman: \"\"\u00a0\u2013 \"With tempest and storm on distant seas.\") The helmsman falls asleep. A ghostly vessel appearing astern is dashed against Daland's vessel by the sea and the grappling irons hold the two ships together. Invisible hands furl the sails. A man of pale aspect, dressed in black, his face framed by a thick black beard, steps ashore. He laments his fate. (Aria: \"\"\u00a0\u2013 \"The time has come and seven years have again elapsed\") Because he once invoked Satan, the ghost captain is cursed to roam the sea forever without rest. An angel brought to him the terms of his redemption: Every seven years the waves will cast him upon the shore; if he can find a wife who will be true to him he will be released from his curse.\nDaland wakes up and meets the stranger. The stranger hears that Daland has an unmarried daughter named Senta, and he asks for her hand in marriage, offering a chest of treasure as a gift. Tempted by gold, Daland agrees to the marriage. The southwind blows and both vessels set sail for Daland's home.\nAct 2.\nA group of local girls are singing and spinning in Daland's house. (Spinning chorus: \"\u00a0\u2013 \"Whir and whirl, good wheel\") Senta, Daland's daughter, dreamily gazes upon a gorgeous picture of the legendary Dutchman that hangs from the wall; she desires to save him. Against the will of her nurse, she sings to her friends the story of the Dutchman (Ballad with the Leitmotiv), how Satan heard him swear and took him at his word. She vows to save him by her fidelity.\nThe huntsman Erik, Senta's former boyfriend, arrives and hears her; the girls depart, and the huntsman, who loves the maiden, warns her, telling her of his dream, in which Daland returned with a mysterious stranger, who carried her off to sea. She listens with delight, and Erik leaves in despair.\nDaland arrives with the stranger; he and Senta stand gazing at each other in silence. Daland is scarcely noticed by his daughter, even when he presents his guest as her betrothed. In the following duet, which closes the act, Senta swears to be true till death.\nAct 3.\nLater in the evening, the local girls bring Daland's men food and drink. They invite the crew of the strange vessel to join in the merry-making, but in vain. The girls retire in wonder; ghostly forms appear at work upon the vessel, and Daland's men retreat in fear.\nSenta arrives, followed by Erik, who reproves her for deserting him, as she had formerly loved him and vowed constancy. When the stranger, who has been listening, hears these words, he is overwhelmed with despair, as he thinks he is now forever lost. He summons his men, tells Senta of the curse, and to the consternation of Daland and his crew declares that he is \"Der fliegende Holl\u00e4nder.\"\nAs the Dutchman sets sail, Senta throws herself into the sea, claiming that she will be faithful to him unto death. This is his salvation. The spectral ship disappears, and Senta and the Dutchman are seen ascending to heaven.\nReferences.\nNotes\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFootnotes\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources"}

The story of the eponymous character is taken from medieval German romance, notably the \"Parzival\" of Wolfram von Eschenbach, and its sequel \"Lohengrin\", itself inspired by the epic of \"Garin le Loherain\". It is part of the Knight of the Swan legend.\nThe opera has inspired other works of art. King Ludwig II of Bavaria named his castle Neuschwanstein Castle after the Swan Knight. It was King Ludwig's patronage that later gave Wagner the means and opportunity to complete, build a theatre for, and stage his epic cycle \"Der Ring des Nibelungen\". He had discontinued composing it at the end of Act II of \"Siegfried\", the third of the \"Ring\" tetralogy, to create his radical chromatic masterpiece of the late 1850s, \"Tristan und Isolde\", and his lyrical comic opera of the mid-1860s, \"Die Meistersinger von N\u00fcrnberg\".\nThe most popular and recognizable part of the opera is the Bridal Chorus, colloquially known in English-speaking countries as \"Here Comes the Bride,\" usually played as a processional at weddings. The orchestral preludes to Acts I and III are also frequently performed separately as concert pieces.\nThe autograph manuscript of the opera is preserved in the Richard Wagner Foundation.\nLiterary background.\nThe literary figure of Lohengrin first appeared as a supporting character in the final chapter of the medieval epic poem \"Parzival\" of Wolfram von Eschenbach. The Grail Knight Lohengrin, son of the Grail King Parzival, is sent to the duchess of Brabant to defend her. His protection comes under the condition that she must never ask his name. If she violates this requirement, he will be forced to leave her. Wagner took up these characters and set the \"forbidden question\" theme at the core of a story which makes contrasts between the godly and the mundane, and between Early Middle Age Christendom and Germanic paganism. Wagner attempted at the same time to weave elements of Greek tragedy into the plot. He wrote the following in \"Mitteilungen an meine Freunde\" about his Lohengrin plans:Who doesn't know \"Zeus and Semele\"? The god is in love with a human woman and approaches her in human form. The lover finds that she cannot recognize the god in this form, and demands that he should make the real sensual form of his being known. Zeus knows that she would be destroyed by the sight of his real self. He suffers in this awareness, suffers knowing that he must fulfill this demand and in doing so ruin their love. He will seal his own doom when the gleam of his godly form destroys his lover. Is the man who craves for God not destroyed?\nComposition.\n\"Lohengrin\" was written and composed between 1845 and 1848 when Wagner worked as Kapellmeister at the Royal Dresden court. The opera's genesis, however, starts some years earlier when Wagner was living and working in Paris. By late 1841, Wagner had conceived a five-act historical opera based on the Hohenstaufen dynasty entitled \"Die Sarazenin\" (The Saracen Woman) and, although he lavished on it all the trappings of Grand Opera, his attention was soon distracted by a Volksbuch that he obtained through his friendship with the philologist Samuel Lehrs. The book in question was Ludwig Bechstein's 1835 anthology of legends \"Der Sagenschatz und die Sagenkreise des Th\u00fcringerlandes\". As well as being the means by which Wagner first became aware of the Lohengrin legend, the anthology also retold the tale of Tannh\u00e4user.\nSeeking a more authentic picture of the Tannh\u00e4user legend, Lehrs then provided Wagner with the annual proceedings of the K\u00f6nigsberg Germanic Society which not only included C.T.L. Lucas's critical study of the \"Wartburg war\" but also included a piece of criticism about the poem \"Lohengrin\", together with a lengthy narrative of the rambling epic's principal content. Thus, Wagner admits, with one blow a whole new world was opened to him, and although unable to find the form to master the material for his own dramatic purpose, he could clearly visualize Lohengrin and it remained as an inextinguishable image within him.\nStewart Spencer neither regards the abandonment of the Hohenstaufen projects during the 1840s at this time nor, more specifically, in the musical and formal dissimilarities between \"\" and \"Der fliegende Holl\u00e4nder\" as symptomatic of a fundamental turn from history towards myth. Instead Spencer argues that Wagner did not draw any fundamental distinction between history and myth, and that Wagner's response to myth is dynamic and dialectical. History per se might be arid and reductive but it contained within it the potential for a categorical interpretation allowing Wagner to make use of Leopold August Warnk\u00f6nig's (1835\u201342), three volume \"Flandrische Staats- und Rechtsgeschichte bis zum Jahr 1305\" to be mined for an accurate evocation of 10th century Brabant. It would be nearly four years before Wagner's image of Lohengrin would again manifest itself to his creative imagination.\nWriting retrospectively in his 1865 biography (even if its royal patronage diminishes its reliability), Wagner tells the story of how \"Lohengrin\"'s libretto was written. In the summer of 1845 Wagner with his wife Minna planned their annual hydrotherapeutic visit to Marienbad. Putting his work as Kapellmeister at the Royal Dresden court out of his mind, Wagner's intention was to abandon himself to a life of leisure. He had chosen his summer reading with care: the poems of Wolfram von Eschenbach, and the anonymous epic of Lohengrin with an introduction by Joseph von G\u00f6rres. Although he had not planned on writing an opera at the time, he was inspired by his reading to create the opera Lohengrin:\nLohengrin stood suddenly revealed before me in full armor at the center of a comprehensive dramatic adaptation of the whole material. ... I struggled manfully against the temptation to set down the plan on paper. But I was fooling myself: no sooner had I stepped into the noonday bath than I was seized by such desire to write Lohengrin that, incapable of lingering in the bath for the prescribed hour, I leapt out after only a few minutes, scarcely took the time to clothe myself again properly, and ran like a madman to my quarters to put what was obsessing me on paper. This went on for several days, until the entire dramatic plan for Lohengrin had been set down in full detail.\nBy 3 August 1845 he had worked out the prose draft. Wagner wrote to his brother, Albert, the following day, 4 August 1845:\n...it was in this frame of mind yesterday that I finished writing out a very full &amp; detailed scenario for Lohengrin; I am delighted with the result, indeed I freely admit that it fills me with a feeling of proud contentment. ... the more familiar I have become with my new subject &amp; the more profoundly I have grasped its central idea, the more it has dawned upon me how rich &amp; luxurious the seed of this new idea is, a seed which has grown into so full &amp; burgeoning a flower that I feel happy indeed. ...In creating this work, my powers of invention &amp; sense of formal structure have played their biggest part to date: the medieval poem which has preserved this highly poetical legend contains the most inadequate &amp; pedestrian account to have come down to us, and I feel very fortunate to have satisfied my desire to rescue what by now is an almost unrecognizable legend from the rubble &amp; decay to which the medieval poet has reduced the poem as a result of his inferior &amp; prosaic treatment of it, &amp; to have restored it to its rich &amp; highly poetical potential by dint of my own inventiveness &amp; reworking of it. \u2013 But quite apart from all this, how felicitous a libretto it has turned out to be! Effective, attractive, impressive &amp; affecting in all its parts! \u2013 Johanna's role in it (Albert's daughter \u2013 see illustration below) \u2013 which is very important &amp; in point of fact the principal role in the work \u2013 is bound to turn out the most charming &amp; most moving in the world.\nBetween May and June 1846, Wagner made a through-composed draft for the whole work that consisted of two staves: one for the voice, the other just indicating the harmonies. Simultaneously, Wagner began work on a second draft of the poem, beginning with Act III. The complete draft of Act III was completed before the second draft of Acts I and II. This has sometime led to the erroneous conclusion that the entire work was completed from the end to the front. On 9 September 1846 Wagner began to orchestrate the harmonies and write out the choral parts, which, along with the Prelude, was completed on 29 August 1847.\nNumerous changes to the poem, particularly Act III, took place during work on the second draft. At this time Wagner was still trying to clarify the precise nature of the tragedy, and the extent to which he needed to spell out the mechanics of the tragedy to the audience. On 30 May 1846 Wagner wrote to the journalist Hermann Franck regarding the relationship between Lohengrin and Elsa. It is apparent from the letter that Wagner and Franck had been discussing Lohengrin for some time, and Wagner refers back to an earlier argument about the relationship between Lohengrin and Elsa, and in particular whether Elsa's punishment of separation from Lohengrin at the end of the opera is justifiable. Wagner uses the letter firstly to argue in favour of his version and secondly to expand upon the more general mythical structure underpinning the relationship between Lohengrin and Elsa \u2013 a theme he would publicly develop in his 1851 autobiographical essay A Communication To My Friends. Elsa's punishment, Wagner argues, cannot be chastisement or death but that her separation from Lohengrin: 'this idea of separation- which, if it were left out, would require a total transformation of the subject and probably allow no more than its most superficial externals to be retained'. Franck's concern appears to be that this particular punishment of separation will make the opera incapable 'of being dramatically effective in a unified way'. Wagner confesses that Franck's concerns have forced him to look objectively at the poem and to consider ways of making Lohengrin's involvement in the tragic outcome clearer than had previously been the case. To this end, Wagner decided not to alter Act I or II but to write new lines in Act III:\n&lt;poem&gt;\n(Wagner wrote five additional lines here but they were rejected in the final draft).&lt;/poem&gt;\nLater, in the same act, when Elsa calls on Lohengrin to punish her, the latter replies:\n&lt;poem&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;\nWagner asks Franck if he should explicitly mention the specific rule associated with the Grail which, although not expressly forbidding the Grail knights from committing such excesses, nevertheless, discourages them from acting in this way. Wagner's opinion is that it should be sufficient for the audience to deduce the Grail's advice. Readers of the libretto in English will note that in Amanda Holden's 1990 singing translation for the English National Opera, the Grail's advice is transformed into an explicit commandment, with Holden acknowledging, on her website, that translating a libretto is effectively writing a new one \"despite its compulsory faithfulness to the original\".\n&lt;poem&gt;There's one atonement, penance for your crime!\nAh! I as you suffer this cruel pain!\nWe must be parted! You must understand:\nthis the atonement, this the Grail's command!&lt;/poem&gt;\nHaving completed the second complete draft of Act III ten months later on 5 March 1847, Wagner returned to the beginning of Act I and began work on the second draft of Act I on 12 May and which was complete on 8 June 1847. The second complete draft of Act II was started on 18 June and complete on 2 August 1847. In a letter to Ferdinand Heine dated 6 August 1847, Wagner announced that he had completed the \"Lohengrin\" opera:\nI feel pleased and happy as a result, since I am well satisfied with what I have done.\nAs outlined to Heine, Wagner's plan was to build on the success of the premiere of Rienzi in Berlin on 24 October 1847 with a follow-up performance of \"Lohengrin\". As it turned out \"Rienzi\" in Berlin was not a success and \"Lohengrin\" was not performed there until 1859.\nComposition of the full score began three months later on 1 January 1848, and by 28 April 1848 the composition of Lohengrin was complete. In September 1848 Wagner conducted excerpts from Act I at a concert in Dresden to mark the 300th anniversary of the court orchestra (later Dresden Staatskapelle).\nMusical style.\n\"Lohengrin\" occupies an ambiguous position within Wagner's aesthetic oeuvre. Despite Wagner's ostensible rejection of French grand op\u00e9ra, \"Lohengrin\", like all Wagner's operas, and especially his later Musikdramas, owes some debt to the form as practiced by Auber, Hal\u00e9vy and, irrespective of what Wagner sets out in his prose writings, Meyerbeer. \"Lohengrin\" is also the last of Wagner's four \"Romantic\" operas, and continues with the associative style of tonality that he had previously developed in \"Tannh\u00e4user\". And \"Lohengrin\" is also the last of his composed works before his political exile, and despite the seventeen-year-long performance hiatus, \"Lohengrin\"'s musical style nevertheless anticipates Wagner's future leitmotif technique.\nPerformance history.\nThe first production of \"Lohengrin\" was in Weimar, Germany, on 28 August 1850 at the Staatskapelle Weimar under the direction of Franz Liszt, a close friend and early supporter of Wagner. Liszt chose the date in honour of Weimar's most famous citizen, Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, who was born on 28 August 1749. Despite the inadequacies of the lead tenor Karl Beck, it was a success.\nWagner himself was unable to attend the first performance, having been exiled because of his part in the 1849 May Uprising in Dresden. Although he conducted various extracts in concert in Zurich, London, Paris and Brussels, it was not until 1861 in Vienna that he was able to attend a full performance.\nThe opera's first performance outside German-speaking lands was in Riga on 5 February 1855. The Austrian premiere took place in Vienna at the Theater am K\u00e4rntnertor on 19 August 1858, with R\u00f3za Csillag as Ortrud. The work was produced in Munich for the first time at the National Theatre on 16 June 1867, with Heinrich Vogl in the title role and Mathilde Mallinger as Elsa.\n\"Lohengrin\"'s Russian premiere, outside Riga, took place at the Mariinsky Theatre on 16 October 1868.\nThe Belgian premiere of the opera was given at La Monnaie on 22 March 1870 with \u00c9tienne Troy as Friedrich von Telramund and Feliciano Pons as Heinrich der Vogler.\nThe United States premiere of \"Lohengrin\" took place at the Stadt Theater at the Bowery in New York City on 3 April 1871. Conducted by Adolf Neuendorff, the cast included Theodor Habelmann as Lohengrin, Luise Garay-Lichtmay as Elsa, Marie Frederici as Ortrud, Adolf Franosch as Heinrich and Edward Vierling as Telramund. The first performance in Italy took place seven months later at the Teatro Comunale di Bologna on 1 November 1871 in an Italian translation by operatic baritone Salvatore Marchesi. It was notably the first performance of any Wagner opera in Italy. Angelo Mariani conducted the performance, which starred Italo Campanini as Lohengrin, Bianca Blume as Elsa, Maria L\u00f6we Destin as Ortrud, Pietro Silenzi as Telramund, and Giuseppe Galvani as Heinrich der Vogler. The performance on 9 November was attended by Giuseppe Verdi, who annotated a copy of the vocal score with his impressions and opinions of Wagner (this was almost certainly his first exposure to Wagner's music).\nLa Scala produced the opera for the first time on 30 March 1873, with Campanini as Lohengrin, Gabrielle Krauss as Elsa, Philippine von Edelsberg as Ortrud, Victor Maurel as Friedrich, and Gian Pietro Milesi as Heinrich.\nThe United Kingdom premiere of \"Lohengrin\" took place at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, on 8 May 1875 using the Italian translation by Marchesi. Auguste Vianesi conducted the performance, which featured Ernesto Nicolini as Lohengrin, Emma Albani as Elsa, Anna D'Angeri as Ortruda, Maurel as Friedrich, and Wladyslaw Seideman as Heinrich. The opera's first performance in Australia took place at the Prince of Wales Theatre in Melbourne on 18 August 1877. The Metropolitan Opera mounted the opera for the first time on 7 November 1883, in Italian, during the company's inaugural season. Campanini portrayed the title role with Christina Nilsson as Elsa, Emmy Fursch-Madi as Ortrud, Giuseppe Kaschmann as Telramund, Franco Novara as Heinrich, and Auguste Vianesi conducting.\n\"Lohengrin\" was first publicly performed in France at the Eden-Th\u00e9\u00e2tre in Paris on 30 April 1887 in a French translation by Charles-Louis-\u00c9tienne Nuitter. Conducted by Charles Lamoureux, the performance starred Ernest van Dyck as the title hero, Fid\u00e8s Devri\u00e8s as Elsa, Marthe Duvivier as Ortrud, Emil Blauwaert as Telramund, and F\u00e9lix-Adolphe Couturier as Heinrich. There was however an 1881 French performance given as a Benefit, in the Cercle de la M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e Salon at Nice, organized by Sophie Cruvelli, in which she took the role of Elsa. The opera received its Canadian premiere at the opera house in Vancouver on 9 February 1891 with Emma Juch as Elsa. The Palais Garnier staged the work for the first time the following 16 September with van Dyck as Lohengrin, Rose Caron as Elsa, Caroline Fi\u00e9rens-Peters as Ortrud, Maurice Renaud as Telramund and Charles Douaillier as Heinrich.\nThe first Chicago performance of the opera took place at the Auditorium Building (now part of Roosevelt University) on 9 November 1891. Performed in Italian, the production starred Jean de Reszke as the title hero, Emma Eames as Elsa and \u00c9douard de Reszke as Heinrich.\nLohengrin was first performed as part of the Bayreuth Festival in 1894, in a production directed by the composer's widow, Cosima Wagner, with Willi Birrenkoven and Ernst van Dyck, Emil Gerh\u00e4user alternating as Lohengrin, Lillian Nordica as Elsa, Marie Brema as Ortrud and Demeter Popovic as Telramund and was conducted by Felix Mottl.\nInstrumentation.\n\"Lohengrin\" is scored for the following instruments:\n\"on-stage\"\nPlace: Antwerp, on the Scheldt River, in the Duchy of Lotharingia\nTime: Sometime between 925, when Henry the Fowler acquired Lotharingia as a vassal state, and 933, when his wars with the Magyars ended\nSynopsis.\nSummary.\nThe people of the Brabant are divided by quarrels and political infighting; also, a devious hostile power left over from the region's pagan past is seeking to subvert the prevailing monotheistic government and to return Brabant to pagan rule. A mysterious knight, sent by God and possessing superhuman charisma and fighting ability, arrives to unite and strengthen the people, and to defend the innocent noblewoman Elsa from a false accusation of murder, but he imposes a condition: the people must follow him without knowing his identity. Elsa in particular must never ask his name, or his heritage, or his origin. The conspirators attempt to undermine her faith in her rescuer, to create doubt among the people, and to force him to leave.\nAct 1.\nKing Henry the Fowler has arrived in Brabant, where he has assembled the German tribes in order to expel the marauding Hungarians from his dominions. He also needs to settle a dispute involving the disappearance of the child-Duke Gottfried of Brabant. The Duke's guardian, Count Friedrich von Telramund, has accused the Duke's older sister, Elsa, of murdering her brother in order to become Duchess of Brabant. Telramund calls upon the King to punish Elsa and to make him the new Duke of Brabant.\nThe King calls for Elsa to answer Telramund's accusation. Elsa does not answer the King's inquiries, only lamenting her brother's fate (\"Einsam in tr\u00fcben Tagen\"). The King declares that he cannot resolve the matter and will leave it to God's judgment through ordeal by combat. Telramund, a strong and seasoned warrior, agrees enthusiastically. When the King asks Elsa who shall be her champion, Elsa describes a knight she has beheld in her dreams (\"Des Ritters will ich wahren\").\nTwice the Herald calls for a champion to step forward, but gets no response. Elsa kneels and prays that God may send her champion to her. A boat drawn by a swan appears on the river and in it stands a knight in shining armour. He disembarks, dismisses the swan, respectfully greets the king, and asks Elsa if she will have him as her champion and marry him. Elsa kneels in front of him and places her honour in his keeping. He asks only one thing in return for his service: Elsa must never ask him his name or where he has come from. Elsa agrees to this (\"Wenn ich im Kampfe f\u00fcr dich siege\").\nTelramund's supporters advise him to withdraw because he cannot prevail against the Knight's powers, but he proudly refuses. The chorus prays to God for victory for the one whose cause is just. Ortrud, Telramund's wife, does not join the prayer, but privately expresses confidence that Telramund will win. The combat commences. The unknown Knight defeats Telramund but spares his life (\"Durch Gottes Sieg ist jetzt dein Leben mein\"). Taking Elsa by the hand, he declares her innocent. The crowd exits, cheering and celebrating.\nAct 2.\n\"Night in the courtyard outside the cathedral\"\nTelramund and Ortrud, banished from court, listen unhappily to the distant party-music. Ortrud reveals that she is a pagan witch (daughter of Radbod Duke of Frisia), and tries to revive Telramund's courage, assuring him that her people (and he) are destined to rule the kingdom again. She plots to induce Elsa to violate the mysterious knight's only condition.\nWhen Elsa appears on the balcony before dawn, she hears Ortrud lamenting and pities her. As Elsa descends to open the castle door, Ortrud prays to her pagan gods, Wodan and Freia, for malice, guile, and cunning, in order to deceive Elsa and restore pagan rule to the region. Ortrud warns Elsa that since she knows nothing about her rescuer, he could leave at any time as suddenly as he came, but Elsa is sure of the Knight's virtues. The two women go into the castle. Left alone outside, Telramund vows to bring about the Knight's downfall.\nThe sun rises and the people assemble. The Herald announces that Telramund is now banished, and that anyone who follows Telramund shall be considered an outlaw by the law of the land. In addition, he announces that the King has offered to make the unnamed knight the Duke of Brabant; however, the Knight has declined the title, and prefers to be known only as \"Protector of Brabant\". The Herald further announces that the Knight will lead the people to glorious new conquests, and will celebrate the marriage of himself and Elsa. In the back of the crowd, four noblemen quietly express misgivings to each other because the Knight has rescinded their privileges and is calling them to arms. Telramund secretly draws the four noblemen aside and assures them that he will regain his position and stop the Knight, by accusing him of sorcery.\nAs Elsa and her attendants are about to enter the church, Ortrud rushes to the front of the procession and challenges Elsa to explain who the Knight is and why anyone should follow him. Their conversation is interrupted by the entrance of the King with the Knight. Elsa tells both of them that Ortrud was interrupting the ceremony. The King tells Ortrud to step aside, then leads Elsa and the Knight toward the church. Just as they are about to enter the church, Telramund enters. He claims that his defeat in combat was invalid because the Knight did not give his name (trial by combat traditionally being open only to established citizens), then accuses the Knight of sorcery. He demands that the Knight must reveal his name; otherwise the King should rule the trial by combat invalid. The Knight refuses to reveal his identity and claims that only one person in the world has the right to make him do so: his beloved Elsa, and she has pledged not to exercise that right. Elsa, though visibly shaken and uncertain, assures him of her confidence. King Henry refuses Telramund's questions, and the nobles of Brabant and Saxony praise and honor the Knight. Elsa falls back into the crowd where Ortrud and Telramund try to intimidate her, but the Knight forces them both to leave the ceremony, and consoles Elsa. Elsa takes one last look at the banished Ortrud, then enters the church with the wedding procession.\nAct 3.\n\"Scene 1: The bridal chamber\"\nElsa and her new husband are ushered in with the well-known bridal chorus, and they express their love for each other. Ortrud's words, however, have made an impression on Elsa; she laments that her name sounds so sweet on her husband's lips but she cannot utter his name. She asks him to tell her his name when no one else is around, but at all instances he refuses. Finally, despite his warnings, she asks the Knight the fatal questions. Before the Knight can answer, Telramund and his four recruits rush into the room in order to attack him. The Knight defeats and kills Telramund. Then, he sorrowfully turns to Elsa and asks her to follow him to the King, to whom he will now reveal his secrets.\n\"Scene 2: On the banks of the Scheldt (as in act 1)\"\nThe troops arrive equipped for war. Telramund's corpse is brought in. Elsa comes forward, then the Knight. He tells the King that Elsa has broken her promise, and discloses his identity (\"In fernem Land\") by recounting the story of the Holy Grail and of Monsalvat. He reveals himself as Lohengrin, Knight of the Grail and son of King Parsifal, sent to protect an unjustly accused woman. The laws of the Holy Grail say that Knights of the Grail must remain anonymous. If their identity is revealed, they must return home.\nAs Lohengrin sadly bids farewell to Elsa, the swan-boat reappears. Lohengrin tells Elsa that if she had kept her promise, she could have recovered her lost brother, and gives her his sword, horn and ring, for he is to become the future leader of Brabant. As Lohengrin tries to get in the boat, Ortrud appears. She tells Elsa that the swan is actually Gottfried, Elsa's brother, whom she cursed to become a swan. The people consider Ortrud guilty of witchcraft. Lohengrin prays and the swan turns back into young Gottfried. Lohengrin declares him the Duke of Brabant. Ortrud sinks as she sees her plans thwarted.\nA dove descends from heaven and, taking the place of the swan at the head of the boat, leads Lohengrin to the castle of the Holy Grail. A grief-stricken Elsa falls to the ground dead.\nInterpretations.\nLiszt initially requested Wagner to carefully translate his essay on the opera from French into German, that he might be the principal and long-standing interpreter of the work \u2013 a work which, after performing, he regarded as \"a sublime work from one end to the other\".\nIn their article \"Elsa's reason: on beliefs and motives in Wagner's \"Lohengrin\"\", Ilias Chrissochoidis and Steffen Huck propose what they describe as \"a complex and psychologically more compelling account [of the opera]. Elsa asks the forbidden question because she needs to confirm Lohengrin's belief in her innocence, a belief that Ortrud successfully erodes in Act II. This interpretation reveals Elsa as a rational individual, upgrades the dramatic significance of the Act I combat scene, and, more broadly, signals a return to a hermeneutics of Wagnerian drama.\"\nOperatic mishaps.\nTenors have sometimes run into trouble in the third act, just before Lohengrin departs by stepping on a swan-driven vessel or on the swan itself. In 1913, the Moravian tenor Leo Slezak is reported to have missed hopping on the swan, afterwards turning to Elsa with the question: \"Wann geht der n\u00e4chste Schwan?\" (\"When does the next swan leave?\"). In 1936, at the Metropolitan Opera, the same thing happened to Danish tenor Lauritz Melchior.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It was originally developed under the name \"Heliborne laser, fire-and-forget missile\", which led to the colloquial name \"Hellfire\" ultimately becoming the missile's formal name. It has a multi-mission, multi-target precision-strike ability and can be launched from multiple air, sea, and ground platforms, including the MQ-1 Predator and MQ-9 Reaper. The Hellfire missile is the primary class air-to-ground precision weapon for the armed forces of the United States and many other countries. It has also been fielded on surface platforms in the surface-to-surface and surface-to-air roles.\nDescription.\nMost variants are laser-guided, with one variant, the AGM-114L \"Longbow Hellfire\", being radar-guided. Laser guidance can be provided either from the launcher, such as the nose-mounted opto-electronics of the AH-64 Apache attack helicopter, other airborne target designators or from ground-based observers, the latter two options allowing the launcher to break line of sight with the target and seek cover.\nThe development of the Hellfire Missile System began in 1974 with the United States Army requirement for a \"tank-buster\", launched from helicopters to defeat armored fighting vehicles.\nThe Hellfire II, developed in the early 1990s is a modular missile system with several variants, and entered service with the U.S. Army in 1996. Hellfire II's semi-active laser variants\u2014AGM-114K high-explosive anti-tank (HEAT), AGM-114KII with external blast fragmentation sleeve, AGM-114M (blast fragmentation), and AGM-114N metal augmented charge (MAC)\u2014achieve pinpoint accuracy by homing in on a reflected laser beam aimed at the target. The General Atomics MQ-1 Predator and MQ-9 Reaper unmanned combat aerial vehicles (UCAVs) carry the Hellfire\u00a0II, but the most common platform is the helicopter gunship, such as the AH-64 Apache or AH-1 Cobra, which can carry up to 16 of them each. The AGM-114L, or Longbow Hellfire, is a fire-and-forget weapon: equipped with millimeter-wave (MMW) active radar homing, it requires no further guidance after launch\u2014even being able to lock on to its target after launch\u2014and can hit its target without the launcher or other friendly unit being in line of sight of the target. It also works in adverse weather and battlefield obscurants, such as smoke and fog, which can mask the position of a target or prevent a designating laser from forming a detectable reflection. Each Hellfire weighs , including the warhead, and has a range of depending on trajectory. The Hellfire has a Circular Error Probable (CEP) of less than .\nThe AGM-114R \"Romeo\" Hellfire II entered service in late 2012. It uses a semi-active laser homing guidance system and a K-charge multipurpose warhead to engage targets that formerly needed multiple Hellfire variants. It will replace AGM-114K, M, N, and P variants in U.S. service.\nIn October 2012, the U.S. ordered 24,000 Hellfire\u00a0II missiles, for both the U.S. armed forces and foreign customers.\nA possible new JCM successor called the Joint Air to Ground Missile (JAGM) is under consideration. Due to budget reductions, JAGM development was separated into increments, with increment\u00a01 focusing on adding a millimeter-wave radar to the Hellfire-R to give it a dual-mode seeker, enabling it to track moving targets in bad weather.\nOperational history.\nIn 2009, the British Ministry of Defence (MoD) acknowledged that Army Air Corps (AAC) AgustaWestland Apaches had used AGM-114N Hellfire missiles against Taliban forces in Afghanistan. The MoD stated that 20 missiles were used in 2008 and a further 20 in 2009. In the British Parliament, Liberal Democrat politician Nick Harvey argued that the \"Parliament must be reassured these are a weapon of last resort.\"\nAGM-114 Hellfire missiles were used to kill Hamas leader Ahmed Yassin by the Israeli Air Force (IAF) in 2004, and by the US military to kill American-born Islamic cleric Anwar al-Awlaki in Yemen in 2011, Al-Qaeda operative Abu Yahya al-Libi in Pakistan in 2012, al-Shabaab militant Mukhtar Abu Zubair in Somalia in 2014, and British ISIL executioner Mohammed Emwazi (also known as \"Jihadi John\") in Syria in 2015. They were also used in the assassination of Qasem Soleimani as well as the killing of Ayman al-Zawahiri.\nThe AGM-114 has occasionally been used as an air-to-air missile. The first operational air-to-air kill with a Hellfire took place on 24\u00a0May 2001, after a civilian Cessna\u00a0152 aircraft entered Israeli airspace from Lebanon, with unknown intentions and refusing to answer or comply with ATC repeated warnings to turn back. An Israeli Air Force AH-64A Apache helicopter fired on the Cessna, resulting in its complete disintegration.\nIn January 2016 \"The Wall Street Journal\" reported that one training missile without a warhead was accidentally shipped to Cuba in 2014 after a training mission in Europe; it was later returned. A US official said that this was an inert \"dummy\" version of the Lockheed system stripped of its warhead, fuse, guidance equipment and motor, known as a \"Captive Air Training Missile\".\n* Produced: 1982\u20131992\n* Target: Armored vehicles\n* Range: \n* Guidance:\n** Semi-active laser homing (SALH)\n** Non-programmable\n** Analog autopilot\n* Warhead: shaped charge HEAT.

Its lethality is due to of dense material with six blades flying at high speed, to crush and cut the targeted person\u2014the R-9X has also been referred to as the \"Ninja Missile\" and \"Flying Ginsu\". It is intended to reduce collateral damage when targeting specific people. Deployed in secret in 2017, its existence has been public since 2019. This variant was used in the killing in 2017 of Abu Khayr al-Masri, a member of Al-Qaeda's leadership, and in 2019 of Jamal Ahmad Mohammad Al Badawi, accused mastermind of the 2000 USS \"Cole\" bombing. The weapon has also been used in Syria, and in Afghanistan against a Taliban commander. It was used twice in 2020 against senior al-Qaeda leaders in Syria; in September 2020 US officials estimated that it had been used in combat six times.\n Hellfire missiles fired by a Reaper drone were used on 31 July 2022 to kill Ayman al-Zawahiri, the leader of Al-Qaeda, who had previously been involved in planning the 9/11 and other attacks on US targets. It was reported that the missile hit him on a balcony, causing minimal collateral damage. Reports stress that avoiding other casualties was a priority for the mission, following drone attacks that killed several uninvolved people, attracting much criticism. It is widely thought that the Hellfires were the R-9X variant, but a United States Special Operations Command spokesman declined to comment, while confirming that the R9X was \"in US Special Operations Command's munitions inventory\".\n Images of the aftermath of a US attack on a member of Kata'ib Hezbollah (claimed to be Abu Baqir al-Saadi by Hezbollah affiliated reports) suggests an R-9X was used. The nature and announcement of the attack has led Howard Altman to suggest the weapon system is made more widely available to US forces. In December 2024 an R-9X appears to have been used near Idlib.\nIn late February 2025 the US government made video of an R-9X in action public for the first time; the missile was used by CENTCOM to kill the senior commander of Al-Qaeda affiliate Hurras al-Din in Northwest Syria.\nLaunch vehicles and systems.\nExperimental platforms.\nThe system has been tested for use on the Humvee and the Improved TOW Vehicle (ITV). Test shots have also been fired from a C-130 Hercules. Sweden and Norway use the Hellfire for coastal defense and have conducted tests with Hellfire launchers mounted on the Combat Boat 90 coastal assault boat.\nThe US Navy evaluated the missile for use on the \"Freedom\"-class littoral combat ship and \"Independence\"-class littoral combat ship from 2014. The missile was successfully fired from a LCS in early 2017. This system is set to deploy by late 2019.\nIn 2016 the Longbow Hellfire was tested by the US Army using a 15-tube Multi-Mission Launcher mounted on a Family of Medium Tactical Vehicles (FMTV) truck. The MML is an Army-developed weapon system capable of deploying both surface-to-surface and surface-to-air missiles.\nThe Longbow Hellfire initially equipped the Maneuver Short-Range Air Defense (M-SHORAD) version of the Stryker to serve as a surface-to-air counter-drone missile, but in 2024 the U.S. Army prohibited its use on the platform after discovering that prolonged placement of the missiles on a ground vehicle created wear and tear that lead to potential safety concerns.\nOperators.\nThe following countries use the Hellfire:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;"}
{"id": "38152", "revid": "14604687", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=38152", "title": "Governor General of Canada", "text": "Federal representative of the Canadian monarch\nThe governor general of Canada () is the federal representative of the Canadian monarch, currently King\u00a0Charles III. The monarch of Canada is also sovereign and head of state of 14 other Commonwealth realms and resides in the United Kingdom. The monarch, on the advice of his or her Canadian prime minister, appoints a governor general to administer the government of Canada in the monarch's name. The commission is for an indefinite period\u2014known as serving \"at His Majesty's pleasure\"\u2014usually five years. Since 1959, it has also been traditional to alternate between francophone and anglophone officeholders. The 30th and current governor general is Mary Simon, who was sworn in on 26 July 2021. An Inuk leader from Nunavik, Quebec, Simon is the first Indigenous person to hold the office.\nAs the sovereign's representative, the governor general carries out the day-to-day constitutional and ceremonial duties of the monarch. The constitutional duties include appointing lieutenant governors, Supreme Court justices, and senators; signing orders-in-council; summoning, proroguing, and dissolving the federal parliament; granting royal assent to bills; calling elections; and signing commissions for officers of the Canadian Armed Forces. The ceremonial duties include delivering the speech from the throne at the state opening of parliament; accepting letters of credence from incoming ambassadors; and distributing honours, decorations, and medals. Per the tenets of responsible government, the governor general acts almost always (except on the matter of honours) on the advice of the prime minister.\nThe office began in the 17th century, when the French Crown appointed governors of the colony of Canada and, following the British conquest of the colony in 1763, the British monarch appointed governors of the Province of Quebec (later the Canadas). Consequently, the office is, along with the Crown, the oldest continuous institution in Canada. The present version of the office emerged with Canadian Confederation and the passing of the \"British North America Act, 1867\".\nAlthough the post initially still represented the government of the United Kingdom (that is, the monarch in his British council), the office was gradually Canadianized until, with the passage of the \"Statute of Westminster, 1931\", and the establishment of a separate and uniquely Canadian monarchy, the governor general became the direct personal representative of the independently Canadian sovereign (the monarch in his Canadian council). Throughout this process of gradually increasing Canadian independence, the role of governor general took on additional responsibilities, such as acting as commander-in-chief of the Canadian militia in the monarch's stead, and, in 1927, the first official international visit by a governor general was made. In 1947, King George VI issued letters patent allowing the viceroy to exercise almost all powers on behalf of the monarch. As a matter of law, however, the governor general is not in the same constitutional position as the sovereign; the office itself does not, as such, possess any powers of the royal prerogative. Any constitutional amendment that affects the Crown, including the office of governor general, requires the unanimous consent of each provincial legislative assembly as well as the Senate and House of Commons of Canada.\nAppointment.\nThe position of governor general is mandated by both the \"Constitution Act, 1867\" (formerly known as the \"British North America Act, 1867\"), and the \"Letters Patent, 1947\" by King George VI. As such, on the recommendation of the Canadian prime minister, the Canadian monarch appoints the governor general by commission, prepared in Canada, and issued under the Great Seal of Canada and with the royal sign-manual. (Until the appointment of Vincent Massey in 1952, the royal commission was authorized by the monarch's signature and signet.) That individual is, from then until being sworn in, referred to as the \"governor general-designate\".\nBesides the administration of the oaths of office, there is no set formula for the swearing-in of a governor general-designate. Though there may therefore be variations to the following, the appointee will usually travel to Ottawa, there receiving an official welcome and taking up residence at 7 Rideau Gate, and will begin preparations for their upcoming role, meeting with various high-level officials to ensure a smooth transition between governors general. The sovereign will also hold an audience with the appointee and will at that time induct both the governor general-designate and their spouse into the Order of Canada as Companions, as well as appointing the former as a Commander of both the Order of Military Merit and the Order of Merit of the Police Forces (should either person not have already received either of those honours).\nThe incumbent will generally serve for at least five years; though, this is only a developed convention and has been criticized as too short for an office meant to represent a Crown and sovereign meant to embody continuity. The governor general serves \"at His Majesty's pleasure\" (or the \"royal pleasure\"), meaning the prime minister may recommend to the King that the viceroy remain in his service for a longer period of time; some governors general have been in office for more than seven years. No additional formalities are necessary for such an \"extension\"; the governor general carries on until death, resignation, or the appointment of his or her successor. Only once, with the Earl Alexander of Tunis, has a royal proclamation been issued to end a governor general's incumbency.\nShould a governor general die, resign, or leave the country for longer than one month, the chief justice of Canada (or, if that position is vacant or unavailable, the senior puisne justice of the Supreme Court) serves as the administrator of the government of Canada and exercises all powers of the governor general.\nSelection.\nIn a speech on the subject of Confederation, made in 1866 to the Legislative Assembly of the Province of Canada, John A. Macdonald said of the planned governor, \"we place no restriction on Her Majesty's prerogative in the selection of her representative\u00a0... The sovereign has unrestricted freedom of choice\u00a0... We leave that to Her Majesty in all confidence.\" However, between 1867 and 1931, governors general were appointed by the monarch on the advice of the British Cabinet; until 1890, by the secretary of state for the colonies for approval by the prime minister. After that, a policy of consulting the Canadian Cabinet was established; though, this process was not always followed.\nThe Balfour Declaration of 1926 recognized the governor general as no longer a stand-in for the British government, but, rather a direct representative of the Crown. At the Imperial Conference in 1930, it was decided that the Commonwealth ministers would \"tender their formal advice after informal consultation with His Majesty\", thereby settling the current procedure wherein the monarch appoints the governor general on the advice of the Canadian prime minister only. This was codified in the \"Statute of Westminster, 1931\".\nHow many names the prime minister puts forward to the sovereign has varied. Richard Bennett suggested a number of names in an informal letter to King George V in 1930, all of which the King approved, leading Bennett to pick Vere Ponsonby, 9th Earl of Bessborough. Mackenzie King in 1945 gave three names to King George VI, who chose Harold Alexander (later the Viscount Alexander of Tunis). Mackenzie King then made the formal recommendation to the King, which was accepted. Louis St. Laurent, however, gave only one name\u2014Massey's\u2014to George VI. There is typically informal consultation between the prime minister and sovereign, either directly or via the incumbent governor general, on the appointment of the next viceroy before the prime minister gives his official advice to the monarch.\nThe only time the leader of the opposition was consulted on the choice of name to put forward to the monarch for appointment as viceroy was when Lord Tweedsmuir's predecessor, Bessborough, wished to resign as governor general coincidentally just ahead of Parliament reaching the end of its maximum five year life in July 1935, after which an election was required. Mackenzie King, at the time leader of the opposition, expected to win a majority in the upcoming election and stated he would not accept a governor general recommended by then-Prime Minister Bennett, which was a constitutionally unjustifiable position for Mackenzie King to take. King George V became concerned and instructed Bessborough to either remain in office until after the election or bring Bennett and Mackenzie King together to agree on a nominee for his replacement. The governor general consulted with the prime minister and leader of the opposition and settled on Tweedsmuir.\nUntil 1952, all governors general were members of the British aristocracy or former British military officers, diplomats, or politicians raised to the peerage. These viceroys had spent no or little time in Canada prior to their appointment; though it was claimed as their travel schedules were so extensive that they could \"learn more about Canada in five years than many Canadians in a lifetime\". The idea of a Canadian being appointed governor general was raised as early as 1919, when, at the Paris Peace Conference, Canadian prime minister Sir Robert Borden, consulted with South African prime minister Louis Botha, agreeing that viceregal appointees should be long-term residents of their respective dominions. Calls for just such an individual to be made viceroy came again in the late 1930s, but, it was not until Massey's appointment by King George VI in 1952 that the position was filled by a Canadian-born individual. The prime minister at the time, Louis St. Laurent, wrote in a letter to the media, \"[i]t seems to me no one of the King's subjects, wherever he resides, should be considered unworthy to represent the King, provided he has the personal qualifications and a position in the community which are consonant with the dignity and responsibility of that office.\" Massey stated of this, \"a Canadian [as governor general] makes it far easier to look on the Crown as our own and on the Sovereign as Queen of Canada.\"\nThis practice continued until 1999, when Queen Elizabeth II commissioned as her representative Adrienne Clarkson, a Hong Kong-born refugee to Canada. Moreover, the practice of alternating between francophone and anglophone Canadians was instituted with the appointment of Vanier, a francophone who succeeded the anglophone Massey. All persons whose names are put forward to the King for approval must first undergo background checks by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and the Canadian Security Intelligence Service.\nAlthough required by the tenets of constitutional monarchy to be nonpartisan while in office, governors general were often former politicians; a number held seats in the British House of Lords by virtue of their inclusion in the peerage. Appointments of former ministers of the Crown in the 1980s and 1990s were criticized by Peter H. Russell, who stated in 2009: \"much of [the] advantage of the monarchical system is lost in Canada when prime ministers recommend partisan colleagues to be appointed governor general and represent [the King].\" Clarkson was the first governor general in Canadian history with neither a political or military background, as well as the first Asian-Canadian and the second woman, following on Jeanne Sauv\u00e9. The third woman to hold this position was also the first Caribbean-Canadian governor general, Micha\u00eblle Jean.\nThere have been, from time to time, proposals put forward for modifications to the selection process. Citizens for a Canadian Republic has advocated the election of the nominee to the sovereign, either by popular or parliamentary vote; a proposal echoed by Clarkson, who called for the prime minister's choice to not only be vetted by a parliamentary committee, but, also submit to a televised quiz on Canadiana. Constitutional scholars, editorial boards, and the Monarchist League of Canada have argued against any such constitutional tinkering with the viceregal appointment process, stating that the position being \"not elected is an asset, not a handicap\", and that an election would politicize the office, thereby undermining the impartiality necessary to the proper functioning of the governor general. Retired University of Ottawa professor John E. Trent proposed the governor general be head of state and selected by the Officers of the Order of Canada, something Chris Selley argued would politicize both the head of state and the Order of Canada, itself. In 2021, Grand Chief Vernon Watchmaker and Chief Germaine Anderson of the Six Nations of the Grand River wrote to Queen Elizabeth II, suggesting that the federal Cabinet consult treaty nations before the appointment of a new governor general, stating, \"we are partners with the Crown.\"\nA new approach was used in 2010 for the selection of David Johnston as governor general-designate. For the task, prime minister Stephen Harper convened a special search group\u2014the Governor General Consultation Committee\u2014which was instructed to find a non-partisan candidate who would respect the monarchical aspects of the viceregal office and conducted extensive consultations with more than 200 people across the country. In 2012, the committee was made permanent and renamed as the Advisory Committee on Vice-Regal Appointments, with a modified membership and its scope broadened to include the appointment of provincial lieutenant governors and territorial commissioners (though, the latter are not personal representatives of the monarch). However, the next ministry, headed by Justin Trudeau, disbanded the committee in 2017, before he recommended Payette as Johnston's successor that year. Following Payette's resignation, Trudeau formed the Advisory Group on the Selection of the Next Governor General, which selected Mary Simon for appointment as vicereine.\nSwearing-in ceremony.\nThe swearing-in ceremony begins with the arrival at 7 Rideau Gate of one of the ministers of the Crown, who then accompanies the governor general-designate to Parliament Hill, where a Canadian Forces guard of honour (consisting of the Army Guard, Royal Canadian Air Force Guard, and Flag Party of the Royal Canadian Navy) awaits to give a general salute. From there, the party is led by the King's parliamentary messenger\u2014the usher of the Black Rod\u2014to the Senate chamber, wherein all justices of the Supreme Court, senators, members of parliament, and other guests are assembled. The King's commission for the governor general-designate is then read aloud by the secretary to the governor general and the required oaths are administered to the appointee by either the chief justice or one of the puisne justices of the Supreme Court. The three oaths are the Oath of Allegiance, the Oath of Office as Governor General and Commander-in-Chief, and the Oath as Keeper of the Great Seal of Canada. With the affixing of their signature to these three solemn promises, the individual is officially the governor general, and at that moment the flag of the governor general of Canada is raised on the Peace Tower, the \"Vice Regal Salute\" is played by the Central Band of the Canadian Armed Forces, and a 21-gun salute is conducted by the Royal Regiment of Canadian Artillery. The governor general is seated on the throne while a prayer is read, and then receives the Great Seal of Canada (which is passed to the registrar general for protection), as well as the chains of both the chancellor of the Order of Canada and of the Order of Military Merit. The governor general then gives a speech, outlining causes they will champion during their time as viceroy.\nRole.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nIf, and because your Governor-General is in the service of the Crown, he is, therefore\u00a0... in the service of Canada\u00a0... [A]loof though he be from actual executive responsibility, his attitude must be that of ceaseless and watchful readiness to take part\u00a0... in the fostering of every influence that will sweeten and elevate public life; to\u00a0... join in making known the resources and developments of the country; to vindicate, if required, the rights of the people and the ordinariness and Constitution, and lastly, to promote by all means in his power, without reference to class or creed, every movement and every institution calculated to forward the social, moral, and religious welfare of the inhabitants of the Dominion.\nGovernor General the Marquess of Aberdeen, 1893\nCanada shares the person of the sovereign equally with 14 other countries in the Commonwealth of Nations and that individual, in the monarch's capacity as the Canadian sovereign, has 10 other legal personas within the Canadian federation. As the sovereign works and resides in the United Kingdom, the governor general's primary task is to perform federal constitutional duties on behalf of the monarch. As such, the governor general carries on \"the government of Canada on behalf and in the name of the sovereign\".\nThe governor general acts within the principles of parliamentary democracy and responsible government as a guarantor of continuous and stable governance and as a nonpartisan safeguard against the abuse of power. For the most part, however, the powers of the Crown are exercised on a day-to-day basis by elected and appointed individuals, leaving the governor general to perform the various ceremonial duties the sovereign otherwise carries out when in the country; at such a moment, the governor general removes him or herself from public, though the presence of the monarch does not affect the governor general's ability to perform governmental roles.\nPast governor general John Campbell, Marquess of Lorne, said of the job, \"it is no easy thing to be a governor general of Canada. You must have the patience of a saint, the smile of a cherub, the generosity of an Indian prince, and the back of a camel\", and the Earl of Dufferin stated that the governor general is \"a representative of all that is august, stable, and sedate in the government, the history and the traditions of the country; incapable of partizanship and lifted far above the atmosphere of faction; without adherents to reward or opponents to oust from office; docile to the suggestions of his Ministers and, yet, securing to the people the certainty of being able to get rid of an administration or parliament the moment either had forfeited their confidence.\"\nConstitutional role.\nAll executive, legislative, and judicial power in and over Canada is vested in the monarch. The governor general is permitted to exercise most of this power, including the royal prerogative, in the sovereign's name; some as outlined in the \"Constitution Act, 1867\", and some through various letters patent issued over the decades, particularly those from 1947 that constitute the Office of Governor General of Canada. The 1947 letters patent state, \"and We do hereby authorize and empower Our Governor General, with the advice of Our Privy Council for Canada or of any members thereof or individually, as the case requires, to exercise all powers and authorities lawfully belonging to Us in respect of Canada.\" The office itself does not, however, independently possess any powers of the royal prerogative, only exercising the Crown's powers with its permission; a fact the \"Constitution Act, 1867\", left unchanged. Among other duties, the monarch retains the sole right to appoint the governor general. It is also stipulated that the governor general may appoint deputies\u2014usually Supreme Court justices and the secretary to the governor general\u2014who can perform some of the viceroy's constitutional duties in the governor general's absence, and the chief justice of the Supreme Court (or a puisne justice in the chief justice's absence) will act as the administrator of the government upon the death or removal, as well as the incapacitation, or absence of the governor general for more than one month.\nThe governor general is required by the \"Constitution Act, 1867\", to appoint for life persons to the King's Privy Council for Canada, who are all technically tasked with tendering to the monarch and viceroy guidance on the exercise of the royal prerogative. Convention dictates, though, that the governor general must draw from the Privy Council an individual to appoint as prime minister. In almost all cases, this is the member of Parliament who commands the confidence of the House of Commons, whom the governor general must appoint to the Privy Council, if that person is not already a member, so the individual can be appointed prime minister. The prime minister then advises the governor general to appoint other members of parliament to a committee of the Privy Council known as the Cabinet and it is, in practice, only from this group of ministers of the Crown that the king and governor general will take advice on the use of executive power; an arrangement called the \"king-in-Council\" or, more specifically, the \"governor-in-Council\". In this capacity, the governor general will issue royal proclamations and sign orders in council. The governor-in-Council is also specifically tasked by the \"Constitution Act, 1867\", to appoint in the monarch's name, the lieutenant governors of the provinces, senators, the speaker of the Senate, superior, district, and county court judges in each province, except those of the Courts of Probate in Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, and high commissioners and ambassadors. The advice given by the Cabinet is, in order to ensure the stability of government, by political convention typically binding. The governor general has mainly only the right to advise, encourage, and warn; to offer valued counsel to the prime minister.\nBoth the King and his viceroy, however, may in exceptional circumstances invoke the reserve powers, which remain the Crown's final check against a ministry's abuse of power. The reserve power of dismissal has never been used in Canada, although other reserve powers have been employed to force the prime minister to resign on two occasions. In 1896, prime minister Charles Tupper refused to step down after his party failed to win a majority in the House of Commons during that year's election, leading governor general Gordon to no longer recognize Tupper as prime minister and disapprove of several appointments Tupper had recommended. In 1925, the King\u2013Byng affair took place, in which prime minister Mackenzie King, facing a non-confidence motion in the House of Commons, advised governor general Byng to dissolve the new parliament, but Byng refused.\nPeter Hogg, a constitutional scholar, has opined that \"a system of responsible government cannot work without a formal head of state who is possessed of certain reserve powers.\" Further, Eugene Forsey stated \"the reserve power is indeed, under our Constitution, an absolutely essential safeguard of democracy. It takes the place of the legal and judicial safeguards provided in the United States by written Constitutions, enforceable in the courts.\"\nWithin the dominions, until the 1920s, most reserve powers were exercised by a governor general on the advice of either the local or the British Cabinet, with the latter taking precedence. After the Imperial Conference of 1926 produced the Balfour Declaration, formally establishing the autonomy and equal status of Commonwealth governments, governors general ceased to be advised in any way by British ministers.\nIt was decided at the same Imperial Conference that the governor general \"should be kept as fully informed as His Majesty the King in Great Britain of Cabinet business and public affairs.\" How frequently governors general and their prime ministers conversed has varied; some prime ministers have valued their meetings with the viceroy at the time. However, the practice is usually informal and the prime minister will typically schedule a telephone call to request the governor general perform a significant task. The governor general regularly receives the minutes from cabinet meetings and any documents referred to in those minutes. \nThe governor general also summons parliament, reads the speech from the throne, and prorogues and dissolves parliament. The governor general grants royal assent in the king's name; legally, the governor general has three options: grant royal assent (making the bill a law), withhold royal assent (vetoing the bill), or reserve the bill for the signification of the king's pleasure (allowing the sovereign to personally grant or withhold assent). If the governor general withholds the king's assent, the sovereign may within two years disallow the bill, thereby annulling the law in question. No governor general has denied royal assent to a bill. Provincial viceroys, however, are able to reserve royal assent to provincial bills for the governor general, which was last invoked in 1961 by the lieutenant governor of Saskatchewan.\nCeremonial role.\nWith most constitutional functions lent to Cabinet, the governor general acts in a primarily ceremonial fashion. The governor general will host members of Canada's royal family, as well as foreign royalty and heads of state, and will represent the King and country abroad on state visits to other nations, though the monarch's permission is necessary, via the prime minister, for the viceroy to leave Canada. Also as part of international relations, the governor general issues letters of credence and of recall for Canadian ambassadors and high commissioners and receives the same from foreign ambassadors and other Commonwealth countries' high commissioners appointed to Canada.\nThe governor general is also tasked with fostering national unity and pride. Queen Elizabeth II stated in 1959 to governor general Massey, \"maintain[ing] the right relationship between the Crown and the people of Canada [is] the most important function among the many duties of the appointment which you have held with such distinction.\" One way in which this is carried out is travelling the country and meeting with Canadians from all regions and ethnic groups in Canada, continuing the tradition begun in 1869 by governor general John Young. The governor general will also induct individuals into the various national orders and present national medals and decorations. Similarly, the viceroy administers and distributes the Governor General's Awards, and will also give out awards associated with private organizations, some of which are named for past governors general. During a federal election, the governor general will curtail these public duties, so as not to appear as though they are involving themselves in political affairs.\nAlthough the constitution of Canada states that the \"Command-in-Chief of the Land and Naval Militia, and of all Naval and Military Forces, of and in Canada, is hereby declared to continue and be vested in the Queen,\" the governor general acts in his place as commander-in-chief of the Canadian Forces and is permitted through the 1947 letters patent to use the title \"Commander-in-Chief in and over Canada\". The position technically involves issuing commands for Canadian troops, airmen, and sailors, but is predominantly a ceremonial role in which the viceroy will visit Canadian Forces bases across Canada and abroad to take part in military ceremonies, see troops off to and return from active duty, and encourage excellence and morale amongst the forces. The governor general also serves as honorary Colonel of three household regiments: the Governor General's Horse Guards, Governor General's Foot Guards and Canadian Grenadier Guards. This ceremonial position is directly under that of Colonel-in-Chief, which is held by the King. Since 1910, the governor general was also always made the chief scout for Canada, which was renamed \"Chief Scout of Canada\" after 1946 and again in 2011 as \"Patron Scout\".\nResidences and household.\nRideau Hall, located in Ottawa, is the official residence of the Canadian monarch and of the governor general and is thus the location of the viceregal household and the Chancellery of Honours. For a part of each year since 1872, governors general have also resided at the Citadel () in Quebec City, Quebec. A governor general's wife is known as the of Rideau Hall, though there is no equivalent term for a governor general's husband.\nThe viceregal household aids the governor general in the execution of the royal constitutional and ceremonial duties and is managed by the secretary to the governor general. The Chancellery of Honours depends from the King and is thus also located at Rideau Hall and administered by the governor general. As such, the viceroy's secretary \"ex officio\" holds the position of Herald Chancellor of Canada, overseeing the Canadian Heraldic Authority\u2014the mechanism of the Canadian honours system by which armorial bearings are granted to Canadians by the governor general in the name of the sovereign. These organized offices and support systems include aides-de-camp, press officers, financial managers, speech writers, trip organizers, event planners, protocol officers, chefs and other kitchen employees, waiters, and various cleaning staff, as well as visitors' centre staff and tour guides at both official residences. In this official and bureaucratic capacity, the entire household is often referred to as \"Government House\" and its departments are funded through the normal federal budgetary process, as is the governor general's salary of CAD$288,900, which has been taxed since 2013. Additional costs are incurred from separate ministries and organizations such as the National Capital Commission, the Department of National Defence, and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.\nThe governor general's air transportation is assigned to 412 Transport Squadron of the Royal Canadian Air Force. The squadron uses Bombardier Challenger 600 VIP jets to transport the governor general to locations within and outside of Canada.\nSymbols and protocol.\nAs the personal representative of the monarch, the governor general follows only the sovereign in the Canadian order of precedence, preceding even other members of the royal family. Though the federal viceroy is considered \"primus inter pares\" amongst provincial counterparts, the governor general also outranks the lieutenant governors in the federal sphere; at provincial functions, however, the relevant lieutenant governor, as the King's representative in the province, precedes the governor general. The incumbent governor general and their spouse are also the only people in Canada, other than serving Canadian ambassadors and high commissioners, entitled to the use of the style \"His\" or \"Her Excellency\" and the governor general is granted the additional honorific of \"the Right Honourable\" for their time in office and for life afterwards.\nUntil 1952, all governors general of Canada were members of the peerage or heir apparent to a peerage. Typically, individuals appointed as federal viceroy were already a peer, either by inheriting the title, such as the Duke of Devonshire, or by prior elevation by the sovereign in their own right, as was the case with Earl Alexander of Tunis. None were life peers, the Life Peerages Act 1958 postdating the beginning of the tradition of appointing Canadian citizens as governor general. John Buchan was, in preparation for his appointment as governor general, made the Baron Tweedsmuir of Elsfield in the County of Oxford by King George V, six months before Buchan was sworn in as viceroy. The leader of His Majesty's Loyal Opposition at the time, Mackenzie King, felt Buchan should serve as governor general as a commoner. However, George V insisted he be represented by a peer. With the appointment of Massey as governor general in 1952, governors general ceased to be members of the peerage; successive prime ministers since that date have held to the non-binding and defeated (in 1934) principles of the 1919 Nickle Resolution.\nUnder the orders' constitutions, the governor general serves as Chancellor and Principal Companion of the Order of Canada, Chancellor of the Order of Military Merit, and Chancellor of the Order of Merit of the Police Forces. The governor general also upon installation automatically becomes a Knight or Dame of Justice and the Prior and Chief Officer in Canada of the Most Venerable Order of the Hospital of Saint John of Jerusalem. As acting commander-in-chief, the governor general is further routinely granted the Canadian Forces' Decoration by the chief of the Defence Staff on behalf of the monarch. All of these honours are retained following an incumbent's departure from office, with the individual remaining in the highest categories of the orders, and they may also be further distinguished with induction into other orders or the receipt of other awards.\nThe Viceregal Salute \u2014 composed of the first six bars of the Royal Anthem (\"God Save the King\") followed by the first and last four bars of the national anthem (\"O Canada\") \u2014 is the salute used to greet the governor general upon arrival and departure from most official events. To mark the viceroy's presence at any building, ship, airplane, or car in Canada, the governor general's flag is employed. The present form was adopted on 23 February 1981 and, in the federal jurisdiction, takes precedence over all other flags except for the sovereign's flag for Canada. When the governor general undertakes a state visit, however, the national flag is generally employed to mark governor general's presence. This flag is also, along with all flags on Canadian Forces property, flown at half-mast upon the death of an incumbent or former governor general.\nThe crest of the Royal Arms of Canada is employed as the badge of the governor general, appearing on the viceroy's flag and on other objects associated with the person or the office. This is the fourth such incarnation of the governor general's mark since confederation.\nThe governor general may also wear the uniform and corresponding cap or hat badge of a flag or general officer, with a special flag or general officer sleeve braid embellished with the governor general's badge, and a large embroidered governor general's badge on the shoulder straps or boards, facing forward.\nFrench and British colonies.\nFrench colonization of North America began in the 1580s and Aymar de Chaste was appointed in 1602 by King Henry IV as Viceroy of Canada. The explorer Samuel de Champlain became the first unofficial governor of New France in the early 17th century, serving until Charles Huault de Montmagny was in 1636 formally appointed to the post by King Louis XIII. The French Company of One Hundred Associates then administered New France until King Louis XIV took control of the colony and appointed Augustin de Saffray de M\u00e9sy as the first governor general in 1663, after whom 12 more people served in the post.\nWith the signing of the Treaty of Paris in 1763, France relinquished most of its North American territories, including Canada, to Great Britain. King George III then issued in that same year a royal proclamation establishing, amongst other regulations, the Office of the Governor of Quebec to preside over the new Province of Quebec. Nova Scotia and New Brunswick remained completely separate colonies, each with their own governor, until the cabinet of William Pitt adopted in the 1780s the idea that they, along with Quebec and Prince Edward Island, should have as their respective governors a single individual styled as \"governor-in-chief\". The post was created in 1786, with Guy Carleton, 1st Baron Dorchester as its first occupant. However, the governor-in-chief directly governed only Quebec. It was not until the splitting in 1791 of the province of Quebec, to accommodate the influx of United Empire Loyalists fleeing the American revolutionary war, that the King's representative, with a change in title to \"Governor General\", directly governed Lower Canada, while the other three colonies were each administered by a lieutenant governor in his stead.\nFollowing the 1783 recognition of the independence of the 13 continental colonies that became the United States of America and the transfer of East Florida and West Florida to Spain, the remaining British colonies of North America, including Bermuda, were partly integrated as British North America. During the War of 1812, lieutenant-general Sir George Prevost was appointed as \"Captain-General and Governor-in-Chief in and Over the Provinces of Upper-Canada, Lower-Canada, Nova-Scotia, and New-Brunswick, and Their Several Dependencies, Vice-Admiral of the Same, Lieutenant-General and Commander of all His Majesty's Forces in the Said Provinces of Lower Canada and Upper-Canada, Nova-Scotia, and New-Brunswick, and Their Several Dependencies, and in the Islands of Newfoundland, Prince Edward, Cape Breton, and the Bermudas, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.\"\nResponsible government.\nThe Rebellions of 1837 brought about great changes to the role of the governor general, prompting, as they did, the British government to grant responsible government to the Canadian provinces. As a result, the viceroys became largely nominal heads, while the democratically elected legislatures and the premiers they supported exercised the authority belonging to the Crown; a concept first put to the test when, in 1849, Governor-General of the Province of Canada and Lieutenant-Governor of Canada East James Bruce, 8th Earl of Elgin granted Royal Assent to the Rebellion Losses Bill, despite his personal misgivings towards the legislation.\nThis arrangement continued after the reunification in 1840 of Upper and Lower Canada into the Province of Canada, and the establishment of the Dominion of Canada in 1867. The governor general carried out in Canada all the parliamentary and ceremonial functions of a constitutional monarch\u2014amongst other things, granting Royal Assent, issuing Orders-in-Council, and taking advice from the Canadian Privy Council. However, the governor still remained not a viceroy, in the true sense of the word, being still a representative of and liaison to the British government\u2014the Queen in her British council of ministers\u2014who answered to the secretary of state for the colonies in London and who, as a British observer of Canadian politics, held well into the First World War a suite of offices in the East Block of Parliament Hill. But, the new position of Canadian high commissioner to the United Kingdom, created in 1880, began to take over the governor general's role as a link between the Canadian and British governments, leaving the viceroy increasingly as a personal representative of the monarch. As such, the governor general had to retain a sense of political neutrality; a skill that was put to the test when John Campbell, Marquess of Lorne, disagreed with his Canadian prime minister, John A. Macdonald, over the dismissal of Lieutenant Governor of Quebec Luc Letellier de St-Just. On the advice of the colonial secretary, and to avoid conflict with the Canadian Cabinet, Campbell did eventually concede and released St-Just from duty. The governor general was then in May 1891 called upon to resolve the dominion's first cabinet crisis, wherein Macdonald died, leaving Lord Stanley of Preston to select a new prime minister.\nAs early as 1880, the viceregal family and court attracted minor ridicule from the Queen's subjects: in July of that year, someone under the pseudonym \"Captain Mac\" included in a pamphlet called \"Canada: from the Lakes to the Gulf\", a coarse satire of an investiture ceremony at Rideau Hall, in which a retired inn-keeper and his wife undergo the rigorous protocol of the royal household and sprawl on the floor before the Duke of Argyll so as to be granted the knighthood for which they had \"paid in cold, hard cash\". Later, prior to the arrival of Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught and Strathearn (the uncle of King George V), to take up the post of governor general, there was a \"feeble undercurrent of criticism\" centring on worries about a rigid court at Rideau Hall; worries that turned out to be unfounded as the royal couple was actually more relaxed than their predecessors.\nEmerging nationality to an independent kingdom.\nDuring the First World War, into which Canada was drawn due to its association with the United Kingdom, the governor general's role turned from one of cultural patron and state ceremony to one of military inspector and morale booster. Starting in 1914, governor general Prince Arthur donned his field marshal's uniform and put his efforts into raising contingents, inspecting army camps, and seeing troops off before their voyage to Europe. These actions, however, led to conflict with the prime minister at the time, Robert Borden; though the latter placed blame on military secretary Edward Stanton, he also opined that the Duke \"laboured under the handicap of his position as a member of the Royal Family and never realized his limitations as Governor General\". Prince Arthur's successor, Victor Cavendish, 9th Duke of Devonshire, faced the Conscription Crisis of 1917 and held discussions with his Canadian prime minister, as well as members of the official opposition, on the matter. Once the government implemented conscription, Devonshire, after consulting on the pulse of the nation with Sir Wilfrid Laurier, Vincent Massey, Henri Bourassa, Archbishop of Montreal Paul Bruch\u00e9si, Duncan Campbell Scott, Vilhjalmur Stefansson, and Stephen Leacock, made efforts to conciliate Quebec, though he had little real success.\nCanada's national sentiment had gained fortitude through the country's sacrifices on the battlefields of the First World War and, by war's end, the interference of the British government in Canadian affairs was causing ever-increasing discontent amongst Canadian officials; In 1918, \"The Toronto Star\" was even advocating the end of the office. The governor general's role was also changing to focus less on the larger Empire and more on uniquely Canadian affairs, including the undertaking of official international visits on behalf of Canada, the first being that of the Marquess of Willingdon to the United States, where he was accorded by President Calvin Coolidge the full honours of representative of a head of state. It would be another decade, however, before the King-Byng Affair: another catalyst for change in the relationship between Canada\u2014indeed, all the dominions\u2014and the United Kingdom, and thus the purpose of the governor general.\nIn 1926, prime minister Mackenzie King, facing a no-confidence vote in the House of Commons over a scandal in his party, requested that governor general Byng dissolve parliament and call an election. Byng, however, refused his Canadian prime minister's advice, citing both the facts that King held the minority of seats in the house and that a general election had been held only months earlier; he thus called on Arthur Meighen to form a government. Within a week however, Meighen's Conservative government lost its own non-confidence vote, forcing the Governor General to dissolve parliament and call elections that saw Mackenzie King returned to power. King then went on to the Imperial Conference that same year and there pushed for reorganizations that resulted in the Balfour Declaration, which declared formally the practical reality that had existed for some years: namely, that the dominions were fully autonomous and equal in status to the United Kingdom. These new developments were codified in the Statute of Westminster, through the enactment of which on 11 December 1931, Canada, along with the Union of South Africa and the Irish Free State, immediately obtained formal legislative independence from the UK. In addition, the Balfour Declaration also held that the governor general would cease to act as the representative of the British government. Accordingly, in 1928, the United Kingdom appointed its first High Commissioner to Canada thus effectively ending the governor general's diplomatic role as the British government's envoy.\nThe governor general thus became solely the representative of the monarch within Canadian jurisdiction, ceasing completely to be an agent of the British Cabinet, and as such would be appointed only on the advice of his Canadian prime minister. The Canadian Cabinet's first recommendation under this new system was still, however, a British subject born outside of Canada, John Buchan (later Lord Tweedsmuir).\nTweedsmuir's birthplace aside, though, the professional author took further than any of his predecessors the idea of a distinct Canadian identity, travelling the length and breadth of the country, including, for the first time for a governor general, the Arctic regions. Not all Canadians, however, shared Tweedsmuir's views; the baron raised the ire of imperialists when he said in Montreal in 1937: \"a Canadian's first loyalty is not to the British Commonwealth of Nations, but to Canada and Canada's King\", a statement the \"Montreal Gazette\" dubbed as \"disloyal\". During Tweedsmuir's time as viceroy, which started in 1935, calls began to emerge for a Canadian-born individual to be appointed as governor general; but Tweedsmuir died suddenly in office in 1940, while Canada was in the midst of the Second World War, and Mackenzie King did not feel it was the right time to search for a suitable Canadian. The Earl of Athlone was instead appointed by King George VI, Athlone's nephew, to be his viceroy for the duration of the war.\nQuebec nationalism and constitutional patriation.\nIt was in 1952, a mere five days before King George VI's death, that Vincent Massey became the first Canadian-born person to be appointed as a governor general in Canada since the Marquis de Vaudreuil-Cavagnal was made governor general of New France on 1 January 1755, as well as the first not to be elevated to the peerage since Sir Edmund Walker Head in 1854. There was some trepidation about this departure from tradition and Massey was intended to be a compromise: he was known to embody loyalty, dignity, and formality, as expected from a viceroy.\nAs his viceregal tenure neared an end, it was thought that Massey, an anglophone, should be followed by a francophone Canadian; and so, in spite of his Liberal Party attachments, Georges Vanier was chosen by Conservative prime minister John Diefenbaker as the next governor general. Vanier was subsequently appointed by Queen Elizabeth II, in person, at a meeting of her Canadian Cabinet, thus initiating the convention of alternating between individuals from Canada's two main linguistic groups. This move did not, however, placate those who were fostering the new Quebec nationalist movement, for whom the monarchy and other federal institutions were a target for attack. Though Vanier was a native of Quebec and fostered biculturalism, he was not immune to the barbs of the province's sovereigntists and, when he attended \"la F\u00eate St-Jean-Baptiste\" in Montreal in 1964, a group of separatists held placards reading \"'\" (\"Vanier sold out\") and \"'\" (\"Vanier Queen's jester\").\nIn light of this regional nationalism and a resultant change in attitudes towards Canadian identity, images and the role of the monarchy were cautiously downplayed, and Vanier's successor, Roland Michener, was the last viceroy to practice many of the office's ancient traditions, such as the wearing of court uniform by the governor general, the requirement of court dress for state occasions, and expecting women to curtsey before the governor general. At the same time, he initiated new practices for the viceroy, including regular conferences with the lieutenant governors and the undertaking of state visits. He presided over Canada's centennial celebrations and the coincidental Expo 67, to which French president Charles de Gaulle was invited. Michener was with de Gaulle when he made his infamous \"\" speech in Montreal and was cheered wildly by the gathered crowd while they booed and jeered Michener. With the additional recognition of the monarchy as a Canadian institution, the establishment of a distinct Canadian honours system, an increase of state visits coming with Canada's growing role on the world stage, and the more prevalent use of television to visually broadcast ceremonial state affairs, the governor general became more publicly active in national life.\nThe Cabinet in June 1978 proposed the constitutional amendment Bill C-60, that, amongst other changes, vested executive authority directly in the governor general and renamed the position as \"First Canadian\", but the proposal was thwarted by the provincial premiers. When the constitution was patriated four years later, the new amending formula for the documents outlined that any changes to the Crown, including the Office of the Governor General, would require the consent of all the provincial legislatures plus the federal parliament. By 1984, Canada's first female governor general, Jeanne Sauv\u00e9, was appointed. While it was she who created the Canadian Heraldic Authority, as permitted by letters patent from Queen Elizabeth II, and who championed youth and world peace, Sauv\u00e9 proved to be a controversial vicereine, closing to the public the grounds of the Queen's residence and self-aggrandizingly breaching protocol on a number of occasions.\nWithering and renaissance.\nSarah Ferguson, said in 2009 that sometime during her marriage to the then Prince Andrew, Duke of York (later Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor), her husband was offered the position of governor general of Canada, and she speculated in hindsight that their agreement to refuse the commission may have been a contributing factor in their eventual break-up. Instead, Sauv\u00e9's tenure as governor general was book-ended by a series of appointments\u2014Edward Schreyer, Ray Hnatyshyn, and Rom\u00e9o LeBlanc\u2014that have been generally regarded as mere patronage postings for former politicians and friends of the incumbent prime minister at the time, and despite the duties they carried out, their combined time in the viceregal office is generally viewed as unremarkable at best, and damaging to the office at worst. As David Smith described it: \"Notwithstanding the personal qualities of the appointees, which have often been extraordinary, the Canadian governor general has become a hermetic head of state\u2014ignored by press, politicians and public.\" It was theorized by Peter Boyce that this was due, in part, to widespread misunderstanding about the governor general's role coupled with a lack of public presence compared to the media coverage dedicated to the increasingly presidentialized prime minister.\nIt was with the Queen's appointment of Adrienne Clarkson, on the advice of prime minister Jean Chr\u00e9tien, that a shift in the office took place. Clarkson was the first Canadian viceroy to have not previously held any political or military position\u2014coming as she did from a background of television journalism with the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation\u2014was the first since 1952 to have been born outside of Canada, the first from a visible minority (she is of Chinese ancestry), and, by her being accompanied to Rideau Hall by her husband, author and philosopher John Ralston Saul, the official appointment brought an unofficial pair to the viceregal placement, in that the governor general would not be the only person actively exploring Canadian theory and culture. Clarkson managed to bring the viceregal office back into the collective consciousness of Canadians, winning praise for touring the country more than any of her predecessors, her inspiring speeches, and her dedication to the military in her role as the commander-in-chief's representative. This did not come without a cost, however, as the attention also drew widespread criticism of the governor general's increased spending on state affairs, for which the office was symbolically rebuked by parliament when it voted in favour of cutting by 10% the viceregal budget it had earlier supported, as well as for fostering the notion, through various demonstrations, that the governor general was ultimately the Canadian head of state above the Queen herself, an approach that was said by Jack Granatstein to have caused \"a fury\" with the Queen on one occasion in 2004. This attitude was not unique to Clarkson, though; it had been observed that, for some decades, staff at Rideau Hall and various government departments in Ottawa had been pushing to present the governor general as head of state, part of a wider Liberal policy on the monarchy that had been in effect at least since the proposed constitutional changes in the 1970s, if not the 1964 Truncheon Saturday riot in Quebec City. Indeed, international observers opined that the viceroys had been, over the years, making deliberate attempts to distance themselves from the sovereign, for fear of being too closely associated with any \"Britishness\" the monarch embodied.\nPrime minister Paul Martin followed Chr\u00e9tien's example and, for Clarkson's successor, put forward to the Queen the name of Micha\u00eblle Jean, who was, like Clarkson, a woman, a refugee, a member of a visible minority, a CBC career journalist, and married to an intellectual husband who worked in the arts. Her appointment initially sparked accusations that she was a supporter of Quebec sovereignty, and it was observed that she had on a few occasions trodden into political matters, as well as continuing to foster the notion that the governor general had replaced the Queen as head of state, thereby \"unbalancing\u00a0... the federalist symmetry\". But Jean ultimately won plaudits, particularly for her solidarity with the Canadian Forces and the indigenous peoples in Canada, as well as her role in the parliamentary dispute that took place between December 2008 and January 2009.\nWith the appointment of academic David Johnston, former principal of McGill University and subsequently president of the University of Waterloo, there was a signalled emphasis for the governor general to vigorously promote learning and innovation. Johnston stated in his inaugural address: \"[We want to be] a society that innovates, embraces its talent and uses the knowledge of each of its citizens to improve the human condition for all.\" There was also a recognition of Johnston's expertise in constitutional law, following the controversial prorogations of Parliament in 2008 and 2009, which initiated some debate about the governor general's role as the representative of Canada's head of state.\nIn late 2021, the Office of the Secretary to the Governor General confirmed its internal network was breached in a \"sophisticated cyber incident\". Officials were unable to determine the extent of the information that was accessed. Former security officials speculated that another country may be responsible. The Canadian Centre for Cyber Security, a branch of the Communications Security Establishment, is investigating the incident.\nActivities post-retirement.\nRetired governors general usually either withdraw from public life or go on to hold other public offices. Edward Schreyer, for instance, was appointed Canadian High Commissioner to Australia upon his departure from the viceregal role in 1984, and Micha\u00eblle Jean became the UNESCO special envoy to Haiti and, later, the secretary-general of La Francophonie. Schreyer also become the first former governor general to run for elected office in Canada when he unsuccessfully vied for a seat in the House of Commons as a New Democratic Party candidate. Prior to 1952, several former viceroys returned to political careers in the United Kingdom, sitting with party affiliations in the House of Lords and, in some cases, taking a position in the British Cabinet. The Marquess of Lorne was elected a Member of Parliament in the United Kingdom in 1895, and remained so until he became the Duke of Argyll and took his seat in the House of Lords. Others were made governors in other countries or territories: Charles Stanley Monck, 4th Viscount Monck was appointed Lord Lieutenant of Dublin, the Earl of Aberdeen was appointed Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, and the Earl of Dufferin, Henry Petty-Fitzmaurice, 5th Marquess of Lansdowne, Gilbert Elliot-Murray-Kynynmound, 4th Earl of Minto, and the Earl of Willingdon all subsequently served as Viceroy of India.\nAn outgoing governor general may leave an eponymous award as a legacy, such as the Stanley Cup, the Clarkson Cup, the Vanier Cup, or the Grey Cup. They may found an institution, as Vanier did with the Vanier Institute of the Family and Clarkson with the Institute for Canadian Citizenship. Three former governors general have released memoirs: Lord Tweedsmuir (\"Memory Hold-the-Door\"), Massey (\"What's Past is Prologue\"), and Clarkson (\"Heart Matters\").\nAs of 2021, former governors general are entitled to a lifetime pension of nearly $150,000 and also to claim an additional $206,000 in expenses each year.\nSpelling of the title.\nThe letters patent constituting the office and official publications of the government of Canada spell the title \"governor general\", without a hyphen, unlike in the other Commonwealth realms, which do include a hyphen. As \"governor\" is the noun, the title is pluralized as \"governors general\", rather than \"governor generals\".\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It can be equipped with a variety of warheads, and in more recent versions, guidance systems for point attacks. The Hydra is widely used by US and allied forces, competing with the Canadian CRV7, with which it is physically interchangeable.\nOverview.\nThe Hydra 70 is derived from the diameter Mk 4/Mk 40 Folding-Fin Aerial Rocket developed by the United States Navy for use as a free-flight aerial rocket in the late 1940s. The Mk\u00a040 was used during the Korean and Vietnam wars to provide close air support to ground forces from about 20 different firing platforms, both fixed-wing and armed helicopters.\nThe main change made to produce the Hydra was the Mk. 66 motor which uses a new propellant that offers considerably more thrust, (Mod 2/3) (Mod 4). The fins of the Mk 40 flipped forward from the rear when the rocket left the launching tube, but in the Hydra they are curved to match the outside diameter of the rocket fuselage and flip sideways to open, which is referred to as WAFAR (Wrap-Around Fin Aerial Rocket) instead of FFAR (folding-fin aerial rocket). To improve stability during the time the fins are still opening, the four motor nozzles have a slight cant angle to impart a spin while the rocket is still in the launch tube.\nToday, the OH-58D(R) Kiowa Warrior and AH-64E Apache Longbow, as well as the Marine Corps' versatile UH-1 Huey and AH-1 Cobra, carry the Hydra rocket launcher standard on its weapon pylons.\nService.\nThe family of Hydra 70 (70\u00a0mm) 2.75\u00a0inch rockets perform a variety of functions. The war reserve unitary and cargo warheads are used for anti-materiel, anti-personnel, and suppression missions. The Hydra 70 family of folding-fin aerial rockets also includes smoke screening, illumination, and training warheads. Hydra 70 rockets are known mainly by either their warhead type or by the rocket motor designation, Mk 66 in US military service.\nUnited States.\nIn the U.S. Army, Hydra 70 rockets are fired from the AH-64 Apache and AH-64D Apache Longbow helicopter variants using M261 19-tube rocket launchers, and the OH-58D Kiowa Warrior using seven-tube M260 rocket launchers. In the U.S. Marine Corps, either the M260 or M261 launchers are employed on the AH-1W SuperCobra and AH-1Z Viper, depending upon the mission. The M260 and M261 are used with the Mk 66 series of rocket motor, which replaced the Mk 40 series. The Mk 66 has a reduced system weight and provides a remote fuze setting interface. Hydra 70s have also been fired from UH-60 and AH-6 series aircraft in US Army service.\nThe AH-1G Cobra and the UH-1B \"Huey\" used a variety of launchers including the M158 seven-tube and M200 19-tube rocket launchers designed for the Mk 40 rocket motor; however, these models have been replaced by upgraded variants in the U.S. Marine Corps because they were not compatible with the Mk 66 rocket motor. The Hydra 70 rocket system is also used by the U.S. Navy and the U.S. Air Force.\nAccidents.\nIn 2019, a 72-year-old Taiwanese man was killed after a discarded Hydra rocket which he had cut into with an electric saw exploded. He had believed it to be a length of pipe. The rocket had been caught in the net of a fishing vessel and then discarded by the crew ashore as scrap metal.\nWarheads.\nHydra 70 warheads fall into three categories:\nCommon warheads.\nThe most common warhead for the Hydra 70 rocket is the M151 \"10-Pounder,\" which has a blast radius of 10 meters and lethal fragmentation radius of around 50 meters. The M247 HEDP warheads have similar penetration to the standard M72 LAW warhead (~300 mm of rolled homogenous armor).\nPrecision guided Hydra 70.\nThere are several design efforts to turn the Hydra 70 rocket into a precision guided munition (PGM) to produce a weapon with greater accuracy but at less cost than other guided missiles. These include:\nThe APKWS was the first to be fielded in March 2012, and the TALON entered full rate production for the United Arab Emirates Armed Forces in September 2014.\nThe Turkish ROKETSAN Cirit is a similar missile compatible with 70\u00a0mm rocket launchers, but it was developed from scratch and doesn't use Hydra 70 components.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

(WWTBAM) is an international television game show franchise of British origin, created by David Briggs, Mike Whitehill and Steven Knight. In its format, currently owned and licensed by Sony Pictures Television, contestants tackle a series of multiple-choice questions to win large cash prizes in a format that twists on many game show genre conventions \u2013 only one contestant plays at a time. Similar to radio quizzes, contestants are given the question before deciding whether to answer and have no time limit to answer questions. The cash prize increases as they tackle questions that become increasingly difficult, with the maximum offered in most variants of the format being an aspirational value in the respective local currency, such as \u00a31 million in the British version, $1 million in the American version and \u20b975 million (\u20b97.5 crore) in the Indian version.\nThe original British version debuted on 4 September 1998 on the ITV network, hosted by Chris Tarrant, and ran until 11 February 2014. A revived series of seven episodes to commemorate its 20th anniversary aired in May 2018, hosted by Jeremy Clarkson, and ITV renewed the show for several more series.\nSince its debut, international variants of the show have been aired in around 100 countries, making it the best-selling TV format in television history, and is credited by some as paving the way for the boom in the popularity of reality television.\nHistory.\nThe format of the show was created by David Briggs, Mike Whitehill and Steven Knight, who had earlier created a number of the promotional games for Tarrant's morning show on Capital FM radio, such as the bong game. Tentatively known as \"Cash Mountain\", the show took its finalised title from a song written by Cole Porter for the 1956 film \"High Society\", starring Frank Sinatra and Celeste Holm. Since the original version launched, several individuals have claimed that they originated the format and that Celador had breached their copyright. While many pursued litigation, they were all unsuccessful, and each claim was later settled out-of-court on an agreement/settlement.\nIn March 2006, original producer Celador announced that it was seeking to sell the worldwide rights to \"Millionaire\", together with the rest of its British programme library, as the first phase of a sell-off of the company's format and production divisions. British television producer Paul Smith first had the idea to franchise the UK programme internationally. He developed a series of standards for international variants that ensured they mirrored the British original closely. For example, all hosts were required to appear on-screen wearing Armani suits, as Tarrant did in the UK; producers were forbidden from hiring local composers to create original music, instead using the same music cues used by the British version; and the lighting system and set design were to adhere faithfully to the way they were presented on the British version. Some of Smith's rules have been slightly relaxed over the years as the franchise's development has progressed.\nDutch company 2waytraffic ultimately acquired \"Millionaire\" and all of Celador's other programmes. Two years later, Sony Pictures Entertainment purchased 2waytraffic for \u00a3137.5 million. Sony Pictures Television currently owns and licences the show's format.\nGameplay.\nRules.\nA group of contestants on each episode play a preliminary round called \"Fastest Finger First\". All are given a question by the host and four answers which must be placed within a particular order; in the first season of the original version (1998) and the first four seasons of the Australian version (1999\u20132002), contestants have to answer a multiple-choice question. If any contestants are visually impaired, the host reads the question and four choices all at once, then repeats the choices after the music for the round begins. After time's up, the computer and the host will reveal the correct order (or the correct answer in the latter's case). The contestant who answers correctly in the fastest time goes on to play the main game. In the event that no one gets the question right, another question is given; if two or more contestants answer correctly and with the same time, they are given a tie-breaker to determine who will make a start into the game. This round is only used when a new contestant is being chosen to play the main round, and can be played more than once in an episode among those remaining within the group seeking to play the main game. In celebrity editions, the round is not used; celebrities automatically take part in the main game.\nOnce a contestant enters the main game, they are asked increasingly difficult general knowledge questions by the host. Each features four possible answers, to which the contestant must give the correct answer. Doing so wins them a certain amount of money, with tackling more difficult questions increasing their prize fund. During their game, the player has a set of lifelines that they may use only once to help them with a question, as well as two \"safety nets\" \u2013 if a contestant gets a question wrong, but had reached a designated cash value during their game, they will leave with that amount as their prize. While the first few questions are generally easy, subsequent ones might prompt the host to ask if the answer they gave is their \"final answer\" \u2013 if it is, then it is locked in and cannot be changed. If a contestant feels unsure about an answer and does not wish to play on, they can walk away with the money they have won, to which the host will ask them to confirm this as their final decision; in such cases, the host will usually ask them to state what answer they would have gone for, and reveal if it would have been correct or incorrect.\nOriginal format.\nDuring the British original, between 1998 and 2007, the show's format focused on fifteen questions. The payout structure was as follows (questions at guaranteed levels are highlighted with a bolded text):\nBetween 2007 and 2014, the number of questions was reduced to twelve; the overall change in format was later incorporated into a number of international markets over a period of four years, including the Arab world, Bulgaria, the Netherlands, France, Poland, Spain, and Turkey. The payout structure, as a whole, was subsequently changed as a result, with the second safety net relocated to \u00a350,000 at question 7 (questions at guaranteed levels are highlighted with a bolded text):\nThe game show's revival for British television in 2018 reverted to the original arrangement used before 2007, but with one notable difference, in that the second safety net was made adjustable \u2013 once a contestant reached \u00a31,000, the host asked them, before giving the next question, if they wished to set the next cash prize amount as the second safety net, with this allowing them to set up as high as \u00a3500,000 in their game as a result.\nAmerican format.\nThe American version premiered on ABC in August 1999 as part of a two-week daily special event hosted by Regis Philbin. After this and a second two-week event aired in November 1999, ABC commissioned a regular series that launched in January 2000 and ran until June 2002. The syndication of the game show was conceived and debuted in September 2002. The only difference between it and the British version was episode length \u2013 45 minutes, as opposed to the 60-minute length of the original version. The change meant that the preliminary round of the show \"Fastest Finger\" was eliminated, and contestants had to pass a more conventional game-show qualification test. After passing the qualification test and being chosen, when the show began, the host invited contestants to the studio. Exceptions to this arrangement, in which it was used under the name \"Fastest Finger\" included: primetime special editions of the programme; the 2004 series that was dubbed \"Super Millionaire\", in which the final prize was increased to $10,000,000; and for the 10th-anniversary special of the American edition, which ran during August 2009 for eleven episodes. The decision to remove this round later occurred in other international versions, including the British original, and several versions likes Russia, Holland and Costa Rica before its reinstatement in the renewed series.\nClock format.\nIn 2008, the American version changed its format so that contestants were required to answer questions within a set time limit. The limit varied depending on the difficulty of the question:\nThe clock started immediately after a question was given and the four possible answers appeared. The clock paused when a lifeline was used. If the clock ran out with no answer locked in, the contestant walked away with any prize money won up to that point, unless the \"Double Dip\" lifeline had been used, in which case a failure to give a second answer was treated the same as a wrong answer. This format change was later adopted into other international versions with several minor change\u2013 the British original, for example, adopted this change for episodes from 3 August 2010 to 2014. The Indian version followed on 11 October 2010. Egypt version followed on 20 July 2012 to May 15, 2013, Turkey version followed on 2 August 2011, Israel version followed on 2020 - 2021.\nShuffle format.\nOn 13 September 2010, the American version adopted another significant change to its format. In this change, the game featured two rounds. The first round consisted of ten questions, in which the cash prize associated to each value, along with the category and difficulty for each question, was randomised per game. As such, the difficulty of the question in this round was \"not\" tied to the value associated to it, and a contestant did not know what amount they won unless they provided a correct answer or chose to walk away. As part of this format, the amount of money a contestant won in this round was banked, but if they walked away before completing the round, they left with half the amount that had been banked; if they gave an incorrect answer during this round, they left with just $1,000. If they answered all ten questions correctly, they then moved on to the second round, which stuck to the standard format of the game show \u2013 the remaining questions were set to general knowledge and featured cash prizes of high, non-cumulative values. The contestant could, at this point, walk away with the total amount banked from the first round; otherwise, an incorrect answer meant they left with $25,000. The format was later modified for the fourteenth season of the American version but retained the same arrangement for the last four questions.\nIn 2015, the so-called \"shuffle format\" was scrapped and the show returned to a version that closely resembled the original format.\nOther international formats.\nRisk format.\nIn 2007, the German version modified the show's format with the inclusion of a new feature called \"Risk Mode\". During the main game, contestants are given the choice of choosing this feature, in which if they choose to use it, they gain the use of a fourth lifeline that allows them to discuss question with a member of the audience, in exchange for having no second safety net \u2013 if they get any question between the sixth and final cash prize amount wrong, they leave with the guaranteed amount given for correctly answering five questions. This format became adopted in Austria, Czech Republic, Hungary, Italy, Philippines, Poland, Russia, Switzerland and Venezuela.\nMultiple variants exist of this format. One variant keeps the rule of only one safety net but lets the contestant set it before the game begins. The UK 2018 revival also has a gameplay feature often attributed to the Risk format, allowing the player 2 safety nets, but they get to set their second safety net wherever they would like after the \u00a31,000 threshold, but they can only do it for the question coming up next before they see the question.\nThe Taiwanese version did not have any safety nets or any option to quit; the contestant's winnings won up until they were incorrect on any question was cut by half.\nHot Seat format.\nIn November 2008, the Italian version modified the format of the show under the title (lit.\u2009'Extraordinary Edition'). In this variation of the game, six contestants take part, with each taking it in turns to answer questions and build up their prize fund. Utilising the time limit format introduced in the American version, this variation on the format grants a contestant the right to pass the question on to another player, who cannot pass it on themselves, while eliminating both the option of walking away from a question, and the use of lifelines. If a contestant cannot pass on or correctly answer a question, they are eliminated, and the highest cash value they made is removed. The game ends when all contestants are eliminated or the question for the highest cash value is answered \u2013 if a contestant who answers the final question gives a correct answer, they win that prize; if the final question is answered incorrectly, or the last contestant is eliminated, they win a small prize, provided they reach the fifth-question safety net. This format was later introduced to various markets over the course of a four-year-period from 2009 to 2012, including Norway, Hungary, Spain, Vietnam, Indonesia, Australia, and Chile.\nIn 2009, the Australian version was modified to use the new Italian format, and the name was also changed from \"Extraordinary Edition\" to \"Hot Seat\". In 2017, as part of new modification to the format, the game incorporated the use of the Fastest Finger First round, with the winner able to select a lifeline, out of three that the show provided.\nGamblers' Special format.\nIn 2013, the German version modified the show's format, which runs concurrent with the original format, where only one guaranteed level exists, at \u20ac1,000, and maximum prize is \u20ac2,000,000.\nLifelines.\nDuring a standard play of the game, a contestant is given a series of lifelines to aid them with questions. In the standard format, a contestant has access to three lifelines which each can be used only once per game. More than one lifeline can be used on a single question. The standard lifelines used in the original format of the game show include:\nIn the US, \"Ask the Audience\" and \"Phone a Friend\" had corporate sponsorship at different periods. The original AT&amp;T sponsored \"Phone a Friend\" during the original ABC primetime show and the syndicated version's first season; the current AT&amp;T sponsored the 2009 primetime episodes. From 2004 to 2006, AOL sponsored \"Ask the Audience\" and allowed users of Instant Messenger to participate in the lifeline by adding the screen name \"MillionaireIM\" to their contact list. When a contestant used the lifeline during the show, users received an instant message with the question and the four possible answers and voted for the correct answer. The computer tallied these results alongside the results from the studio audience.\nContestants pre-select multiple friends for \"Phone a Friend\". As soon as the contestant begins to play, producers alert the friends and ask them to keep their phone lines free and wait for three rings before answering. On 11 January 2010, the American version eliminated the use of \"Phone a Friend\" in response to an increasing trend of contestants' friends using web search engines and other internet resources to assist them during the calls. Producers came to feel that the lifeline was giving contestants who had friends with internet access an unfair advantage; they also believed it was contrary to the original intent of the lifeline: friends provided assistance based on what they knew.\nDuring recordings of the current British version, security personnel from the production office stay with contestants' friends at their homes to ensure integrity. During \"The People Play\" specials in 2012 and 2013, friends travelled to the studio and stayed backstage. When a contestant used the lifeline, the friend they called appeared on a monitor in the studio, and both the friend and contestant were able to see and communicate with each other.\nUnique lifelines.\nDuring the course of the game show's history, there were a number of unique lifeline additions in various versions of the programme. These include, but are not limited, to:\nTop prize winners.\nOut of all contestants who have played the game, relatively few have been able to win the top prize on any international version of the show. The first was John Carpenter, who won the top prize on the American version on 19 November 1999. Carpenter famously did not use a lifeline until the final question, using his \"Phone a Friend\" to call his father, not for help, but to tell him he was about to become a millionaire.\nOther notable top-prize winners include:\nOriginal version.\n\"Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?\" debuted in Britain on 4 September 1998, with episodes broadcast on the ITV network. When it began airing, the show was hosted by Chris Tarrant, and became an instant hit \u2013 at its peak in 1999, one edition of the show was watched by over 19 million viewers. While most of the contestants were predominantly members of the general public who had applied to take part, the show later featured special celebrity editions during its later years, often coinciding with holidays and special events.\nOn 22 October 2013, Tarrant decided to leave the programme after hosting it for 15 years. His decision subsequently led ITV to make plans to cancel the programme at the end of his contract, with no further specials being made other than those that were already planned. Tarrant's final episode was a special clip show entitled \"Chris' Final Answer\", which aired on 11 February 2014.\nFour years later, ITV revived the programme for a special 7-episode series, to commemorate the 20th anniversary of the British original. This series of special episodes was hosted by Jeremy Clarkson and aired every evening between 5 and 11 May 2018. The revival received mostly positive reviews from critics and fans, and, as well as high viewing figures, led to ITV renewing the show for another series with Clarkson returning as host.\nInternational versions.\nSince the British original debuted in 1998, several different versions of \"Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?\" have been created across the world, including Australia, the United States, South Africa and India. In total over 100 different international variations have been made.\nAustralia.\nOn 18 April 1999, Nine Network launched an Australian version of the game show for its viewers. This version ran until its final episode, aired on 3 April 2006. After the first version ended, a second version was created, running for six episodes across October and November 2007, before a third version, entitled \"Millionaire Hot Seat\", made its debut on 20 April 2009. The original version was hosted by Eddie McGuire, until he was forced to sacrifice his on-air commitments upon being made the CEO of the network; after his resignation from this role, he resumed his duties as host of subsequent versions of the programme.\nUnited States.\nOn 16 August 1999, ABC launched an American version of the game show for its primetime viewers. Hosted by Regis Philbin, it proved to be a ratings success, becoming the highest-rated television show during the 1999\u20132000 season, with its average audience figures reaching approximately 29 million viewers. After a drop in ratings, this version was cancelled, with its final episode aired on 27 June 2002. On 16 September 2002, Meredith Vieira launched a daily syndicated version of the programme, which she hosted for 11 seasons, until May 2013. After her departure, the show was hosted by Cedric the Entertainer in 2013, and Terry Crews in 2014, before Chris Harrison took full hosting responsibilities in Autumn 2015. On 17 May 2019, the American version was cancelled after a total of 17 seasons and 20 years encompassing both primetime and first-run syndication; the final episode of the series was broadcast on 31 May. However, ABC reversed the cancellation of the programme on 8 January 2020, announcing plans for a twenty-first season, consisting of nine episodes, to be presented by Jimmy Kimmel starting 8 April.\nRussia.\nOn 1 October 1999, NTV launched a Russian version the game show, entitled \"\" (\"Oh, how lucky!\"). This version ran until its final episode on 28 January 2001, whereupon a few weeks later it was relaunched under the Russian translation of \"Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?\", on Channel One. The relaunched version was hosted by Maxim Galkin until 2008 and Dmitry Dibrov until 2022. As a result of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the production of the program was temporarily cancelled. In 2023, the show returned with Yulianna Karaulova as the host with many new changes, and the format's distributor is not involved in the production.\nIndia.\nOn 3 July 2000, an Indian version of the game show was launched. The show was hosted by Amitabh Bachchan in his first appearance on Indian television, and received additional seasons in 2005\u20132006, 2007, and then every year since 2010. Subsequent Indian versions were also made. The original Indian version became immortalised in 2008, within the plot of Danny Boyle's award-winning drama film \"Slumdog Millionaire\", adapted from the 2005 Indian novel \"Q &amp; A\" by Vikas Swarup.\nSri Lanka.\nOn 18 September 2010, a Sinhalese version called \"Obada lakshapathi mamada lakshapathi\" (') was launched by Sirasa TV of the Capital Maharaja Television Network. It is presented by Chandana Suriyabandara, a senior commentator in Sri Lanka. It offers 2 million Sri Lankan rupees as the ultimate prize. On its 10th anniversary, it was rebranded as \"Sirasa Lakshapathi\" (') and the prize was changed to Rs. 3 Million.\nIn May 2011 a Tamil version called \"Ungalil Yaar Maha Latchathipathi\" (\"\") was launched by Shakthi TV. The show is hosted by Abarna Suthan and Balendran Kandeeban. The top prize is 2 million rupees.\nPhilippines.\nIn 2000, a Filipino version of the game show was launched by the government-sequestered Intercontinental Broadcasting Corporation. Hosted by Christopher de Leon and produced by Viva Television, it ran for two years before being axed. On 23 May 2009, the show was relaunched on TV5 with Vic Sotto as the new host. The relaunched version was aired until 7 October 2012, when it was replaced by the Philippine version of \"The Million Pound Drop Live\", but it returned the following year on 15 September 2013, following the success of \"Talentadong Pinoy\" that year. It finally concluded on 22 November 2015.\nItaly.\n was first launched by Endemol on Canale 5 in 2000. In 2002, its name was changed from after the Italian lira was replaced with the euro. Fremantle Italia's unit Wavy produced a new season with four special episodes for its 20th anniversary in 2018, followed by another eight special episodes in 2019. The host was Gerry Scotti for every edition from 2000 to 2011 and from 2018 onward.\nNepal.\n\"Ko Banchha Crorepati\" (\"\"; also simply known as \"KBC Nepal\") first premiered on 2 February 2019 on AP1 Television, scheduled to run for 52 episodes. It is hosted by Rajesh Hamal and produced by SRBN Media Pvt. Ltd. Contestants can win cash prizes up to 1 crore (10 million) Nepalese rupees.\nCosta Rica.\n is the Costa Rican version, hosted by Ignacio Santos Pasamontes. There are three lifelines \u2013 \"50:50\", \"Video Call\" and \"People Speak\". The show was broadcast from 3 February 2009 to 3 September 2013 and from 27 April 2021 onwards. It is shown on the private TV station Teletica. If a contestant gets the fifth question correct, they leave with at least 600,000 Costa Rican col\u00f3n. If a contestant gets the tenth question correct, they leave with at least \u20a13,500,000. Two contestants have won the top prize.\nVietnam.\n\"Ai l\u00e0 Tri\u1ec7u Ph\u00fa\" is the Vietnamese version, currently hosted by \u0110inh Ti\u1ebfn D\u0169ng since 2021 (formerly Lai Van Sam from 2005 to 2017 and Phan \u0110\u0103ng from 2018 to 2020). The show was broadcast from 4 January 2005 to 31 August 2010 and from 5 July 2011 onwards. It is broadcast on VTV3, which was the entertainment channel of Vietnam Television. Contestants can win cash prizes up to 250,000,000\u20ab.\nThe show switched to the Hot Seat version called \"Ai L\u00e0 Tri\u1ec7u Ph\u00fa - Gh\u1ebf N\u00f3ng\" based on the original Australian format from 7 September 2010 to 28 June 2011. Taking audience's feedback into consideration that the original format is more liked and familiar, the show producers decided to convert back to the old format which returned on 5 July 2011.\nThe series produced no top prize winners, but Nguy\u1ec5n L\u00ea Anh, couple B\u00f9i Th\u1ecb H\u00e0 Thanh and \u0110\u00e0o H\u1ed3ng V\u0169 and Ph\u1ea1m Cao Long were only three that won the biggest prize 80,000,000\u20ab. As the show celebrated its 20th anniversary in 2025, it was the longest and so far, being the only Southeast Asian version of Millionaire that still broadcast as of now.\nBefore \"Ai L\u00e0 Tri\u1ec7u Ph\u00fa\" premiered, a predecessor similar show entitled \"R\u1ed3ng V\u00e0ng\", which was the unlicensed version of \"Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?\" based on the Thai version was broadcast on HTV7 (Ho Chi Minh City Television) starting from 23 May 2003 to 10 June 2007 and it became popular until around 2005, when \"Ai L\u00e0 Tri\u1ec7u Ph\u00fa\" premiered.\nOther versions.\nOther notable versions created in other countries, include the following:\nHallmarks.\nMusic.\nThe musical score most commonly associated with the franchise was composed by father-and-son duo Keith and Matthew Strachan. The Strachans' score provides drama and tension, and unlike older game show musical scores, \"Millionaire\"'s musical score was created to feature music playing almost throughout the entire show. The Strachans' main \"Millionaire\" theme song takes inspiration from the \"Mars\" movement of Gustav Holst's \"The Planets\", and their cues from the 6th/3rd to 10th/7th question, and then from the 11th/8th question onwards, take the pitch up a semitone for each subsequent question, in order to increase tension as the contestant progressed through the game. On Game Show Network (GSN)'s \"Gameshow Hall of Fame\" special, the narrator described the Strachan tracks as \"mimicking the sound of a beating heart\", and stated that as the contestant works their way up the money ladder, the music is \"perfectly in tune with their ever-increasing pulse\".\nThe Strachans' \"Millionaire\" soundtrack was honoured by the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers with numerous awards, the earliest of them awarded in 2000. A British album of the musical stings was released in 2000, while a remix of the theme tune became a UK chart hit the same year. The original music cues were given minor rearrangements for the US version's clock format in 2008; for example, the question cues were synced to the \"ticking\" sounds of the game clock. Even later, the Strachan score was removed from the US version altogether for the introduction of the \"shuffle format\" in 2010, in favour of a new musical score with cues written by Jeff Lippencott and Mark T. Williams, co-founders of the Los Angeles-based company Ah2 Music. But the revival season on 2020 in US saw the Strachan music return.\nSoundtrack variants.\nIn 2007, the UK version underwent a major change in identification, most notably the soundtrack was changed from the classic version to a rave remix. These parts of the soundtrack were composed and remixed by Ramon Covalo and Nick Magnus respectively. This score would go on to be used by most international versions of the franchise. However, the 2018 UK revival saw the Strachans' original score reinstated.\nIndia version.\nIn the Indian version, the show theme songs and background music were composed, composed and arranged by musician Sawan Dutta starting from season 5 in 2011. Since 2019, the duo Ajay - Atul are the new musicians who compose and arrange the theme songs for the show, starting from season 15, the rules of the game changed a bit, the main host Amitabh Bachchan and Rohan-Vinayak also participated in the process of arranging the theme songs for the show, some later Indian versions also used these themes.\nSet.\nThe basic set design used in the \"Millionaire\" franchise was conceived by British production designer Andy Walmsley, and is the most reproduced scenic design in television history. Unlike older game shows whose sets are or were designed to make the contestant(s) feel at ease, \"Millionaire\"'s set was designed to make the contestant feel uncomfortable, so that the programme feels more like a thriller movie than a typical quiz show. The floor is made of Plexiglas beneath which lies a huge dish covered in mirror paper. The main game typically has the contestant and host sit in \"Hot Seats\", which are slightly modified, -high Pietranera Arco All chairs situated in the centre of the stage; an LG computer monitor directly facing each seat displays questions and other pertinent information.\nThe lighting system is programmed to darken the set as the contestant progresses further into the game. There are also spotlights situated at the bottom of the set area that zoom down on the contestant when they answer a major question; to increase the visibility of the light beams emitted by such spotlights, oil is vaporised, creating a haze effect. Media scholar Dr. Robert Thompson, a professor at Syracuse University, stated that the show's lighting system made the contestant feel as though they were outside a prison while an escape was in progress.\nWhen the US \"Millionaire\" introduced its \"shuffle format\", the Hot Seats and corresponding monitors were replaced with a single podium and as a result, the contestant and host stand throughout the game and are also able to walk around the stage. According to Vieira, the Hot Seat was removed because it was decided that the seat, which was originally intended to make the contestant feel nervous, actually ended up having contestants feel so comfortable in it that it did not service the production team any longer. Also, two video screens were installed \u2013 one that displays the current question in play, and another that displays the contestant's cumulative total and progress during the game. In September 2012, the redesigned set was improved with a modernised look and feel, in order to take into account the show's transition to high-definition broadcasting, which had just come about the previous year. The two video screens were replaced with two larger ones, having twice as many projectors as the previous screens; the previous contestant podium was replaced with a new one; and light-emitting diode (LED) technology was integrated into the lighting system to give the lights more vivid colours and the set and gameplay experience a more intimate feel.\nCatchphrase.\n\"Millionaire\" has made catchphrases out of several lines used on the show. The most well-known of these catchphrases is the host's question \"Is that your final answer?\", asked whenever a contestant's answer needs to be verified. The question is asked because the nature of the game allows contestants to ponder the options aloud before committing to an answer. Regularly on tier-three questions (and sometimes on tier-two), a dramatic pause occurs between the contestant's statement of their final answer and the host's acknowledgement of whether or not it is correct.\nMany parodies of \"Millionaire\" have capitalised on the \"final answer\" catchphrase. In the United States, the phrase was popularised by Philbin during his tenure as the host of that country's version, to the extent that TV Land listed it in its special \"100 Greatest TV Quotes and Catchphrases\", which aired in 2006.\nOn the Australian versions, McGuire replaces the phrase with \"Lock it in?\"; likewise, the hosts of the Indian version have used varying \"lock\" catchphrases. There are also a number of other non-English versions of \"Millionaire\" where the host does not ask \"[Is that your] final answer?\" or a literal translation thereof. Besides the \"final answer\" question, other catchphrases used on the show include the contestants' requests to use lifelines, such as \"I'd like to phone a friend\"; and a line that Tarrant spoke whenever a contestant was struggling with a particular question, \"Some questions are only easy if you know the answer.\" Another popular catchphrase heard throughout the show is spoke by Tarrant to encourage the player when he hands over the cheque, \"But we don't want to give you that!\"\nReception.\n\"Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?\" has been credited with single-handedly reviving interest in, and breaking new ground for, the television game show. It revolutionised the look and feel of game shows with its unique lighting system, dramatic music cues, and futuristic set. The show also became one of the best selling TV formats in television history, and is credited by some as paving the way for the boom in the popularity of reality television.\nAwards, accolades and honours.\nIn 2000, the British Film Institute honoured the UK version of \"Millionaire\" by ranking it number 23 on its \"BFI TV 100\" list, which compiled what British television industry professionals believed were the greatest programmes to have ever originated from that country. The UK \"Millionaire\" also won the 1999 British Academy Television Award for Best Entertainment Programme, and seven National Television Awards for Most Popular Quiz Programme from 1999 to 2005.\nThe original primetime version of the US \"Millionaire\" won two Daytime Emmy Awards for Outstanding Game/Audience Participation Show in 2000 and 2001. Philbin was honoured with a Daytime Emmy in the category of Outstanding Game Show Host in 2001, while Vieira received one in 2005 and another in 2009, making her the second woman to win an Emmy Award for hosting a game show, and the first to win multiple times. \"TV Guide\" ranked the US \"Millionaire\" No. 7 on its 2001 list of the 50 Greatest Game Shows of All Time, and later ranked it No. 6 on its 2013 \"60 Greatest Game Shows\" list. GSN ranked \"Millionaire\" No. 5 on its August 2006 list of the 50 Greatest Game Shows of All Time, and later honoured the show in January 2007 on its first, and so far only, \"Gameshow Hall of Fame\" special.\nCharles Ingram cheating scandal.\nIn September 2001, British Army Major Charles Ingram apparently won the top prize in the UK \"Millionaire\", but his flip-flopping on each of the final two questions raised suspicion of cheating. When the footage was reviewed, staff made a connection between Fastest Finger contestant Tecwen Whittock's coughing and Ingram's answers. The prize was withheld, and police were called in to investigate the matter further.\nIn March 2003, the Ingrams and Whittock were taken to court on the charge of using fraudulent means to win the top prize on \"Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?\". During the trial, the defence claimed that Whittock had simply suffered from allergies during recording of the second episode, but the prosecution noted that his coughing stopped upon Ingram leaving the set and Whittock subsequently taking his turn on the main game. The trial concluded with all three being found guilty and receiving suspended sentences. After the trial, ITV aired a documentary about the scandal, along with Ingram's entire game, with coughing sounds amplified. As a joke, Benylin paid to have the first commercial shown during the programme's commercial break.\nIn April 2020, ITV aired a three part drama titled \"Quiz\" based upon the scandal.\nOther media.\nMerchandise.\nThree board game adaptations of the UK \"Millionaire\" were released by Upstarts in 1998, and a junior edition recommended for younger players was introduced in 2001. The US version also saw two board games of its own, released by Pressman Toy Corporation in 2000. Other \"Millionaire\" board games have included a game based on the Australian version's Hot Seat format, which was released by UGames; a game based on the Italian version released by Hasbro; and a game based on the French version which was released by TF1's games division.\nAn electronic tabletop version of the game was released by Tiger Electronics in 2000. Six different DVD games based on the UK \"Millionaire\", featuring Tarrant's likeness and voice, were released by Zoo Digital Publishing and Universal Studios Home Entertainment between 2002 and 2008. In 2008, Imagination Games released a DVD game based on the US version, based on the 2004\u20132008 format and coming complete with Vieira's likeness and voice, as well as a quiz book and a 2009 desktop calendar.\nVideo game adaptations.\nThe UK \"Millionaire\" saw five video game adaptations for personal computers and Sony's PlayStation and Sega's Dreamcast consoles, as well as Nintendo's Game Boy Advance, produced by Hothouse Creations and Eidos Interactive.\nBetween 1999 and 2001, Jellyvision produced five games based on the US network version for PCs and the PlayStation, all of them featuring Philbin's likeness and voice. The first of these adaptations \u2013 \"Who Wants to Be a Millionaire\" \u2013 was published by Disney Interactive, while the later four were published by Buena Vista Interactive which had just been spun off from DI when it reestablished itself in attempts to diversify its portfolio. Of the five games, three featured general trivia questions, one was sports-themed, and another was a \"Kids Edition\" featuring easier questions. Eurocom ported the game to the Game Boy Color for the second edition.\nTwo additional US \"Millionaire\" games were released by Ludia in conjunction with Ubisoft in 2010 and 2011; the first of these was a game for Nintendo's Wii console and DS handheld system, as well as a PlayStation 3 port of the Wii version, based on the 2008\u20132010 clock format, with the Wii version offered on the show as a consolation prize to audience contestants during the 2010\u20132011 season. The second, for Microsoft's Xbox 360, was based on the \"shuffle format\" and was offered as a consolation prize during the next season (2011\u20132012).\nLudia also made a Facebook game based on \"Millionaire\" available to players in North America from 2011 to 2016. This game featured an altered version of the \"shuffle format\", condensing the number of questions to twelve \u2013 eight in round one and four in round two. Contestants competed against eight other \"Millionaire\" fans in round one, with the top three playing round two alone. There was no \"final answer\" rule; the contestant's responses were automatically locked in. Answering a question correctly earned a contestant the value of that question, multiplied by the number of people who responded incorrectly. Contestants were allowed to use two of their Facebook friends as \"Jump the Question\" lifelines in round one, and to use the \"Ask the Audience\" lifeline in round two to invite up to 50 such friends of theirs to answer a question for a portion of the prize money of the current question.\nOn 29 October 2020, Microids published a video game under the same name and released it on Steam, PlayStation 4, Xbox One and Nintendo Switch.\nScrapped animated spin-off.\nIn September 2001, Celador signed a deal with DIC Entertainment to produce a cartoon based on the show titled \"The Adventures of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? \u2013 The Animated Series\", had the animated series to be aired, this was supposed to be the first adult animated series from DIC Entertainment. The series was to follow fictional winners of the show, who would have used their prize money to take trips to various exotic locations, while the fictional host would keep in touch with them through the Millionaire Command Center, the series was going to be an adult animated series, was going to be the first animated adaptation of game show.\nThe series was planned to be shown off at MIPCOM that year, however nothing else was confirmed for the series, and was silently scrapped without a formal announcement.\nDisney Parks attraction.\nA theme park attraction based on the show, known as \"Who Wants to Be a Millionaire \u2013 Play It!\", appeared at Disney's Hollywood Studios (when it was known as \"Disney-MGM Studios\") at the Walt Disney World Resort in Orlando, Florida and at Disney California Adventure Park in Anaheim, California. Both the Florida and California \"Play It!\" attractions opened in 2001; the California version closed in 2004, and the Florida version closed in 2006 and was replaced by \"Toy Story Midway Mania!\"\nThe format in the \"Play It!\" attraction was very similar to that of the television show that inspired it. When a show started, a \"Fastest Finger\" question was given, and the audience was asked to put the four answers in order; the person with the fastest time was the first contestant in the Hot Seat for that show. However, the main game had some differences: for example, contestants competed for points rather than dollars, the questions were set to time limits, and the \"Phone a Friend\" lifeline became \"Phone a Complete Stranger\" which connected the contestant to a Disney cast member outside the attraction's theatre who would find a guest to help. After the contestant's game was over, they were awarded anything from a collectible pin, to clothing, to a \"Millionaire\" CD game, to a three-night Disney Cruise.\nSpin-off.\nThe Italian version worked in 2008 on a spin-off of the game show called \"50\u201350\" (Fifty Fifty). Such a spin-off aired in North Macedonia, Nepal, Albania, Kosovo, Spain, Sweden, Greece, Japan, Thailand, Turkey and Egypt.\n50\u201350.\n50\u201350 was a television game show which offers large cash prizes for correctly answering a series of randomised multiple-choice questions of varying difficulty with two options. The format is a spin-off of the quiz show \"Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?\" and was created by Intellygents, 2waytraffic, Endemol and RTI (Reti Televisive Italiane) company of Mediaset, moreover, was exported and aired in many countries around the world.\nGameplay.\nUnlike the traditional \"Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?\", this game is played by a team of two players.\nIn round 1, the playing pair will answer ten questions. Each question is worth a different random amount, and all the money they win goes into their jackpot. If at any point they get an answer wrong, the value of the jackpot is halved. The team plays together but will answer each question separately.\nOnly one player in the couple (determined at random) sees the question and its two answers. They will have ten seconds to lock in their answer. After the first player selects an answer, the host turns to the second player and shows them the question and the answer that the first player chose. (They are not shown the answer that their partner turned down.) Player 2 must now decide whether to agree with Player 1's answer, or to switch the team's answer to the other answer, whatever it may be. If the question is ultimately answered correctly, the value of the question will be added to the bank. Otherwise, the current value of the bank is halved.\nIn round 2, the host poses five questions to one player of the team in succession. After playing them, the other player would have only seen one of the two choices. Now the second player will look at all five answers and determine how many questions the first player answered correctly. If the player guesses too few or too many, the winnings are reduced to zero.\nIn the final round, the host asks five questions to one of the two competitors, this will have 10 seconds to answer each question and her partner will on his electronic screen stand the answer. He or she will decide whether to confirm or choose the option that has not been seen. At the end of the questions the contestant who does not see both answers will have to make a prediction of the number of correct answers given. The total prize money can be won only if the forecast is 5 and proves correct, otherwise the part of the prize money that is won will be proportionately less. If the number of correct answers is guessed, the pair win the prize, otherwise they receive the consolation prize.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;"}

The choice of the word is often motivated by an intention to imply that the garments are alluring, fashionable, or both. In a 2015 US survey, 75% of women reported having worn \"sexy lingerie\" in their lifetime.\nLingerie is made of lightweight, stretchy, smooth, sheer or decorative fabrics such as silk, satin, Lycra, charmeuse, chiffon, or (especially and traditionally) lace. These fabrics can be made of various natural fibres like silk, cotton or of various synthetic fibres such as polyester or nylon.\nEtymology.\nThe word \"lingerie\" is a word taken directly from the French language, meaning undergarments, and used exclusively for more lightweight items of female undergarments. The French word in its original form derives from the French word , meaning 'linen' or 'clothes'. Informal usage suggests visually appealing or even erotic clothing. Although most lingerie is designed to be worn by women, some manufacturers now design lingerie for men.\nOrigins.\nThe concept of lingerie as a visually appealing undergarment was developed during the late nineteenth century. Lady Duff-Gordon of Lucile was a pioneer in developing lingerie that freed women from more restrictive corsets. Through the first half of the 20th century, women wore underwear for three primary reasons: to alter their outward shape (first with corsets and later with girdles or brassieres), for hygienic reasons and for modesty. Before the invention of crinoline, women's underwear was often very large and bulky.\nDuring the late 19th century, corsets became smaller, less bulky and more constricting and were gradually supplanted by the brassiere, first patented in the 20th century by Caresse Crosby. When the First World War broke out, women found themselves filling in men's work roles, creating a demand for more practical undergarments. Manufacturers began to use lighter and more breathable fabrics. In 1935, brassi\u00e8res were updated with padded cups to flatter small breasts and three years later underwire bras were introduced that gave a protruding bustline. There was also a return to a small waist achieved with girdles. The ideal woman of the 1940s was thin, but had curvaceous hips and breasts that were pointy and shapely. In the 1960s, the female silhouette was liberated along with social mores; this era's new \"ideal\" consisted of adolescent breasts, slim hips, and extreme thinness. Andr\u00e9 Courr\u00e8ges was the first to make a fashion statement out of the youth culture when his 1965 collection presented androgynous figures and the image of a modern woman comfortable with her own body.\nAs the 20th century progressed, underwear became smaller and more form fitting. In the 1960s, lingerie manufacturers such as Frederick's of Hollywood begin to glamorise lingerie. The lingerie industry expanded in the 21st century with designs that doubled as outerwear. The French refer to this as 'dessous-dessus,' meaning something akin to innerwear as outerwear.\nMarket structure.\nThe global lingerie market in 2003 was estimated at $29 billion, while in 2005, bras accounted for 56 percent of the lingerie market and briefs represented 29 percent. The United States's largest lingerie retailer, Victoria's Secret, operates almost exclusively in North America, but the European market is fragmented, with Triumph International and DB Apparel predominant. Also prominent are French lingerie houses, including Chantelle and Aubade.\nIn March 2020 \"The Guardian\" reported a trend for male lingerie on the catwalk and predictions as to the likelihood of it successfully extending to the high street fashion stores.\nLegality.\nThe Iranian regime regularly bans vendors who procure and sell imported lingerie dresses."}
{"id": "38166", "revid": "49712780", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=38166", "title": "Avignon", "text": "Prefecture of Vaucluse, Provence-Alpes-C\u00f4te d'Azur, France\n \nAvignon (, , ; (Classical norm) or (Mistralian norm), ; ) is the prefecture of the Vaucluse department in the Provence-Alpes-C\u00f4te d'Azur region of southeastern France. Located on the left bank of the river Rh\u00f4ne, the commune had a population of 93,671 as of the census results of 2017, with about 16,000 (estimate from Avignon's municipal services) living in the ancient town centre enclosed by its medieval walls. The Communaut\u00e9 d'agglom\u00e9ration du Grand Avignon, a cooperation structure of 16 communes, had 197,102 inhabitants in 2022.\nAvignon is France's 35th-largest metropolitan area according to INSEE with 337,039 inhabitants (2020), and France's 13th-largest urban unit with 459,533 inhabitants (2020). Its urban area was the fastest-growing in France from 1999 until 2010 with an increase of 76% of its population and an area increase of 136%. \nBetween 1309 and 1377, during the Avignon Papacy, seven successive popes resided in Avignon and in 1348 Pope Clement VI bought the town from Joanna I of Naples. Papal control persisted until 1791 when during the French Revolution it became part of France. The city is now the capital of the Vaucluse department and one of the few French cities to have preserved its city walls. This is why Avignon is also known as \"'La Cit\u00e9 des Papes\"' (The City of the Popes).\nThe historic centre, which includes the , Avignon Cathedral and the Pont d'Avignon, became a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1995 because of its architecture and importance during the 14th and 15th centuries. The medieval monuments and the annual Festival d'Avignon\u00a0\u2013 one of the world's largest festivals for performing arts\u00a0\u2013 have helped to make the town a major centre for tourism.\nToponymy.\nThe earliest forms of the name were reported by the Greeks: \"Aueni\u1e51n\" (Stephen of Byzantium, Strabo, IV, 1, 11) and \"Aouenn\u00ed\u014dn\" (Ptolemy II, x).\nThe Roman name \"Avenn\u012do Cav\u0103rum\" (Mela, II, 575, Pliny III, 36), i.e. \"Avignon of Cavares\", accurately shows that Avignon was one of the three cities of the Celtic-Ligurian tribe of Cavares, along with Cavaillon and Orange.\nThe current name dates to a pre-Indo-European or pre-Latin theme \"ab-\u00ean\" with the suffix \"-i-\u014dn(e)\". This theme would be a hydronym\u2014i.e. a name linked to the river (Rh\u00f4ne), but perhaps also an oronym of terrain (the \"Rocher des Doms\").\nThe \"Auenion\" of the 1st century BC was Latinized to \"Avenn\u012do\" (or \"Av\u0113n\u012do\"), \"-\u014dnis\" in the 1st century and is written \"Avinhon\" in classic Occitan spelling or \"Avignoun\" in Mistralian spelling. The inhabitants of the commune are called \"avinhonencs\" or \"avignounen\" in both standard Occitan and Proven\u00e7al dialect.\nGeography.\nAvignon is on the left bank of the Rh\u00f4ne river, a few kilometres above its confluence with the Durance, about south-east of Paris, south of Lyon and north-north-west of Marseille. On the west it shares a border with the department of Gard and the communes of Villeneuve-l\u00e8s-Avignon and Les Angles and to the south it borders the department of Bouches-du-Rh\u00f4ne and the communes of Barbentane, Rognonas, Ch\u00e2teaurenard, and Noves.\nThe city is in the vicinity of Orange (north), Carpentras (north-east), Salon-de-Provence, Aix-en-Provence, Marseille (all south-east), Arles (south), N\u00eemes and Montpellier (both south-west). Directly contiguous to the east and north are the communes of Caumont-sur-Durance, Mori\u00e8res-l\u00e8s-Avignon, Le Pontet, and Sorgues.\nGeology and terrain.\nThe region around Avignon is very rich in limestone which is used for building material. For example, the current city walls, measuring 4,330 metres long, were built with the soft limestone abundant in the region called \"mollasse burdigalienne\".\nEnclosed by the city walls, the \"Rocher des Doms\" is a limestone elevation of \"Urgonian\" type, 35 metres high (and therefore safe from flooding of the Rhone which it overlooks) and is the original core of the city. Several limestone massifs are present around the commune (the \"Massif des Angles\", \"Villeneuve-l\u00e8s-Avignon\", \"Alpilles\"...) and they are partly the result of the oceanisation of the Ligurian-Proven\u00e7al basin following the migration of the Sardo-Corsican block.\nThe other significant elevation in the commune is the Montfavet Hill\u2014a wooded hill in the east of the commune.\nThe Rhone Valley is an old alluvial zone: loose deposits cover much of the ground. It consists of sandy alluvium more or less coloured with pebbles consisting mainly of siliceous rocks. The islands in the Rhone, such as the \"\u00cele de la Barthelasse\", were created by the accumulation of alluvial deposits and also by the work of man. The relief is quite low despite the creation of mounds allowing local protection from flooding.\nIn the land around the city there are clay, silt, sand, and limestone present.\nHydrography.\nThe Rhone passes the western edge of the city, but is divided into two branches: the \"Petit Rh\u00f4ne\", or \"dead arm\", for the part that passes next to Avignon and the \"Grand Rh\u00f4ne\", or \"live arm\", for the western channel which passes Villeneuve-l\u00e8s-Avignon in the Gard department. The two branches are separated by an island, the \u00cele de la Barthelasse. The southernmost tip of the \u00cele de la Barthelasse once formed of a separated island, the L'\u00cele de Piot.\nThe banks of the Rhone and the \u00cele de la Barthelasse are often subject to flooding during autumn and March. The publication \"Floods in France since the 6th century until today \u2013 research and documentation\" by Maurice Champion tells about a number of them (until 1862, the flood of 1856 was one of the largest, which destroyed part of the walls). They have never really stopped as shown by the floods in 1943\u20131944 and again on 23 January 1955 and remain important today\u2014such as the floods of 2 December 2003. As a result, a new risk mapping has been developed.\nThe Durance flows along the southern boundary of the commune into the Rhone and marks the departmental boundary with Bouches-du-Rh\u00f4ne. It is a river that is considered \"capricious\" and once feared for its floods (it was once called the \"3rd scourge of Provence\" as well as for its low water: the Durance has both Alpine and Mediterranean morphology which is unusual.\nThere are many natural and artificial water lakes in the commune such as the Lake of Saint-Chamand east of the city.\nArtificial diversions.\nThere have been many diversions throughout the course of history, such as feeding the moat surrounding Avignon or irrigating crops.\nIn the 10th century part of the waters from the \"Sorgue d'Entraigues\" were diverted and today pass under the walls to enter the city. (See Sorgue). This watercourse is called the Vaucluse Canal but Avignon people still call it the \"Sorgue\" or \"Sorguette\". It is visible in the city in the \"Rue des teinturiers\" (street of dyers). It fed the moat around the first defensive walls then fed the moat on the newer eastern city walls (14th century). In the 13th century (under an Act signed in 1229) part of the waters of the Durance were diverted to increase the water available for the moats starting from Bonpas. This river was later called the \"Duran\u00e7ole\". The \"Duran\u00e7ole\" fed the western moats of the city and was also used to irrigate crops at Montfavet. In the city, these streams are often hidden beneath the streets and houses and are currently used to collect sewerage. \nThe Hospital Canal (joining the Duran\u00e7ole) and the Crillon Canal (1775) were dug to irrigate the territories of Montfavet, Pontet, and Ved\u00e8ne. They were divided into numerous \"fioles\" or \"filioles\" (in Proven\u00e7al \"filh\u00f2las\" or \"fiolo\"). Similarly, to irrigate the gardens of the wealthy south of Avignon, the Puy Canal was dug (1808). All of these canals took their water from the Durance. These canals were initially used to flood the land, which was very stony, to fertilize them by deposition of silt. \nAll of these canals have been used to operate many mills.\nSeismicity.\nUnder the new seismic zoning of France defined in Decree No. 2010-1255 of 22 October 2010 concerning the delimitation of the seismicity of the French territory and which entered into force on 1 May 2011, Avignon is located in an area of moderate seismicity. The previous zoning is shown below for reference.\n\"The cantons of Bonnieux, Apt, Cadenet, Cavaillon, and Pertuis are classified in zone Ib (low risk). All other cantons the Vaucluse department, including Avignon, are classified Ia (very low risk). This zoning is for exceptional seismicity resulting in the destruction of buildings.\"\nThe presence of faults in the limestone substrate shows that significant tectonic shift has caused earthquakes in different geological ages. The last major earthquake of significant magnitude was on 11 June 1909. It left a visible trace in the centre of the city since the bell tower of the Augustinians, which is surmounted by an ancient campanile of wrought iron, located in Rue Carreterie, remained slightly leaning as a result of this earthquake.\nClimate.\nAvignon has a hot-summer mediterranean climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification: Csa), though the dry-summer effect is not as strong as coastal locations like Marseille due to its more sheltered inland location. The city experiences mild-cool winters and hot summers, with moderate rainfall year-round. The city is often subject to windy weather; the strongest wind is the mistral. A medieval Latin proverb said of the city: \"Avenie ventosa, sine vento venenosa, cum vento fastidiosa\" (Windy Avignon, pest-ridden when there is no wind, wind-pestered when there is).\nThe record temperature record since the existence of the weather station at Orange is 42.8\u00a0\u00b0C on 28 June 2019 and the record lowest was \u221214.5\u00a0\u00b0C on 2 February 1956.\nThe mistral.\nThe prevailing wind is the mistral for which the windspeed can be beyond 110\u00a0km/h. It blows between 120 and 160 days per year with an average speed of 90\u00a0km/h in gusts. The following table shows the different speeds of the mistral recorded by Orange and Carpentras Serres stations in the southern Rhone valley and its frequency in 2006. \"Normal\" corresponds to the average of the last 53 years from Orange weather reports and that of the last 42 at Carpentras.\nLegend: \"=\" same as normal; \"+\" higher than normal; \"-\" lower than normal\nDemographics.\nIn 2017, the commune had 91,921 inhabitants. \n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Module:Historical populations/styles.css\"/&gt;\nAdministration.\nAvignon is the \"prefecture\" (capital) of Vaucluse \"department\" in the Provence-Alpes-C\u00f4te-d'Azur region. It forms the core of the Grand Avignon metropolitan area (\"communaut\u00e9 d'agglom\u00e9ration\"), which comprises 15 communes on both sides of the river:\nList of mayors.\nList of successive mayors\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Hidden begin/styles.css\"/&gt;Mayors from the French Revolution to 1940\nTwin towns \u2013 sister cities.\nAvignon is twinned with:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nEvolution of the borders of the commune.\nAvignon absorbed Montfavet between 1790 and 1794 then ceded Mori\u00e8res-l\u00e8s-Avignon in 1870 and Le Pontet in 1925. On 16 May 2007 the commune of Les Angles in Gard ceded 13 hectares to Avignon.\nArea and population.\nThe city of Avignon has an area of 64.78\u00a0km2 and a population of 92,078 inhabitants in 2010 and is ranked as follows:\nEconomy.\nAvignon is the seat of the \"Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Vaucluse\" which manages the Avignon\u2013Caumont Airport and the Avignon-Le Pontet Docks.\nAvignon has 7,000 businesses, 1,550 associations, 1,764 shops, and 1,305 service providers. The urban area has one of the largest catchment areas in Europe with more than 300,000 square metres of retail space and 469 m2 per thousand population against 270 on average in France. The commercial area of Avignon Nord is one of the largest in Europe.\nThe tertiary sector is the most dynamic in the department by far on the basis of the significant production of early fruit and vegetables in Vaucluse, The MIN (Market of National Importance) has become the pivotal hub of commercial activity in the department, taking precedence over other local markets (including that of Carpentras).\nA Sensitive urban zone was created for companies wanting to relocate with exemptions from tax and social issues. It is located south of Avignon between the city walls and the Durance located in the districts of Croix Rouge, Monclar, Saint-Chamand, and La Rocade.\nAreas of economic activity.\nThere are nine main areas of economic activity in Avignon.\nThe Courtine area is the largest with nearly 300 businesses (of which roughly half are service establishments, one third are shops, and the rest related to industry) and more than 3,600 jobs. The site covers an area of 300 hectares and is located south-west of the city at the TGV railway station.\nThen comes the Fontcouverte area with a hundred establishments representing a thousand jobs. It is, however, more oriented towards shops than the Courtine area.\nThe MIN area of Avignon is the Agroparc area (or \"Technopole Agroparc\"). The Cristole area is contiguous and both have a little less than a hundred establishments.\nFinally, the areas of Castelette, Croix de Noves, Realpanier, and the airport each have fewer than 25 establishments spread between service activities and shops. The area of the Castelette alone represents more than 600 jobs\u2014i.e. 100 more than Cristole.\nTourism.\nFour million visitors come annually to visit the city and the region and also for its Festival d'Avignon. In 2011 the most visited tourist attraction was the Palais des Papes with 572,972 paying visitors. The annual Festival d'Avignon is the most important cultural event in the city. The official festival attracted 135,800 people in 2012.\nRiver tourism began in 1994 with three river boat-hotels. In 2011 there is a fleet of 21 river boat-hotel vessels, including six sight-seeing boats which are anchored on the quay along the Oulle walkways. In addition, a free shuttle boat connects Avignon to the \u00cele de la Barthelasse and, as of 1987, a harbor master has managed all river traffic.\nThe commune has been awarded one flower by the \"National Council of Towns and Villages in Bloom\" in the \"Competition of cities and villages in Bloom\".\nAgriculture.\nThe city is the headquarters of the International Association of the Mediterranean Tomato, the World Council of the Tomato Industry, and the Inter-Rh\u00f4ne organisation.\nIndustry.\nOnly EDF (Grand Delta) with about 850 employees and \"Onet Propret\u00e9\" with just over 300 exceed 100 employees.\nPublic sector (excluding government).\nThe Henri Duffaut hospital, the City of Avignon, and the CHS of Montfavet are the largest employers in the town with about 2,000 employees each. Then comes the General Council of Vaucluse with about 1,300 employees.\nEmployment.\nIn 2017 the unemployment rate was 26.0% while it was 20.7% in 2007. There are 38,731 people in the Avignon workforce: 102 (0.3%) agricultural workers, 2,194 (5.7%) tradesmen, shopkeepers, and business managers, 5,598 (14.5%) managers and intellectuals, 8,486 (21.9%) middle managers, 11,734 (30.3%) employees, and 9,247 (23.9%) workers.\nTransport.\nRoads.\nAvignon is close to two motorways:\nThe main roads are:\nThe city has nine paid multi-storey car parks with a total of 7,100 spaces, multi-storey car parks under surveillance with a capacity for 2,050 cars with a free shuttle to the city centre, as well as five other free parking areas with a capacity of 900 cars.\nRailways.\nAvignon is served by two railway stations: the historic station built in 1860, the \"Gare d'Avignon-Centre\", just outside the city walls, which can accommodate any type of train and, since 2001, the \"Gare d'Avignon TGV\" in the Courtine district south of the city, on the \"LGV M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e\" line. Since December 2013 the two stations have been connected by a link line\u2014the \"Virgule\". The Montfavet district, which was formerly a separate commune, also has a station.\nAirports.\nThe Avignon - Caumont Airport on the south-eastern commune border has several international routes to England. The major airport in the region with domestic and international scheduled passenger service is the Marseille Provence Airport.\nWater transport.\nThe Rh\u00f4ne has for many centuries been an important means of transportation for the city. River traffic in Avignon has two commercial ports, docking stations for boat cruises, and various riverfront developments. A free shuttle boat has been established between the quay near the city walls and the opposite bank (the \u00eele de la Barthelasse).\nPublic transport.\nTecelys via the \"Orizo network\" is the public transport operator for the commune of Avignon and its surrounding suburbs. Tecelys operates bus services (including BRT named \"Chron'hop\"), as well as bike sharing and car pooling services. The Avignon tramway began operation in October 2019. The city previously had a tram system between 1901 and 1932.\nBicycles.\nAvignon has of bicycle paths. In 2009 the TCRA (former public transport operator) introduced a bicycle sharing system called the \"V\u00e9lopop\"'.\nCultural heritage.\nAvignon has a very large number of sites and buildings (177) that are registered as historical monuments.\nIn the part of the city within the walls the buildings are old but in most areas they have been restored or reconstructed (such as the post office and the Lyc\u00e9e Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Mistral). The buildings along the main street, Rue de la R\u00e9publique, date from the Second Empire (1852\u201370) with Haussmann fa\u00e7ades and amenities around Place de l'Horloge (the central square), the neoclassical city hall, and the theatre district.\nListed below are the major sites of interest with those sites registered as historical monuments indicated:\nThe commune houses more than 500 historical objects, many of which are religious.\nCulture.\nAvignon Festival.\nA theatre festival is held annually in Avignon. Founded in 1947, the Festival d'Avignon (Avignon Festival) comprises traditional theatrical events as well as other art forms such as dance, music, and cinema, making use of the town's historical monuments. Every summer approximately 100,000 people attend the festival. There are really two festivals that take place: the more formal \"Festival In\", which presents plays inside the Palace of the Popes and the more bohemian \"Festival Off\", which is known for its presentation of largely undiscovered plays and street performances.\nAvignon festival was founded by Jean Vilar. This cultural initiative brought, year after year, a major economic boost to the city and to the region of Provence. Indeed, the tourists visiting Avignon during the month of July usually take benefit of their presence to go to the smaller villages around, to discover the local food, local wines, touristic activities, learn some French.\nInternational Congress Centre.\nThe centre was created in 1976 within the premises of the Palace of the Popes and hosts many events throughout the entire year. The Congress Centre, designed for conventions, seminars, and meetings for 10 to 550 persons, now occupies two wings of the Popes' Palace.\n\"Sur le Pont d'Avignon\".\nAvignon is commemorated by the French song 'Sur le Pont d'Avignon' ('On the bridge of Avignon'), which describes folk dancing. The song dates from the mid-19th century when Adolphe Adam included it in the Op\u00e9ra comique \"Le Sourd ou l'Auberge Pleine\", which was first performed in Paris in 1853. The opera was an adaptation of the 1790 comedy by Desforges.\nThe bridge of the song is the Pont Saint-B\u00e9n\u00e9zet over the Rh\u00f4ne, of which only four arches (out of the initial 22) now remain. A bridge across the Rhone was built between 1171 and 1185, with a length of some , but was destroyed during the siege of Avignon by Louis VIII of France in 1226. It was rebuilt but suffered frequent collapses during floods and had to be continually repaired. Several arches were already missing (and spanned by wooden sections) before the remainder was abandoned in 1669.\nSport.\nSporting Olympique Avignon is the local rugby league football team. During the 20th century it produced a number of French international representative players.\nAC Arles-Avignon was a professional association football team. They competed in Ligue 2, after the 2010\u20132011 season competing in Ligue 1 and being relegated back down the following season and ultimately folding in 2016. They played at the Parc des Sports, which has a capacity of just over 17,000.\nEducation.\nThe schools within the commune of Avignon are administered by the Acad\u00e9mie d'Aix-Marseille. There are 26 state nursery schools (\"\u00c9coles maternelles\") for children up to 6, and 32 state primary schools (\"\u00c9coles \u00e9l\u00e9mentaires\") up to 11. There are also 4 private schools.\nUniversity of Avignon.\nUniversity before the Revolution.\nThe medieval University of Avignon, formed from the existing schools of the city, was formally constituted in 1303 by Boniface VIII in a Papal Bull. Boniface VIII and King Charles II of Naples were the first great protectors and benefactors to the university. The Law department was the most important department covering both civil and ecclesiastical law. The law department existed nearly exclusively for some time after the university's formation and remained its most important department throughout its existence.\nIn 1413 Pope John XXIII founded the university's department of theology, which for quite some time had only a few students. It was not until the 16th and 17th centuries that the school developed a department of medicine. The bishop of Avignon was chancellor of the university from 1303 to 1475. After 1475 the bishop became an archbishop but remained chancellor of the university. The papal vice-legate, generally a bishop, represented the civil power (in this case the pope) and was chiefly a judicial officer who ranked higher than the Primicerius (Rector).\nThe Primicerius was elected by the Doctors of Law. In 1503 the Doctors of Law had 4 Theologians and in 1784 two Doctors of Medicine added to their ranks. Since the Pope was the spiritual head and, after 1348, the temporal ruler of Avignon, he was able to have a great deal of influence in all university affairs. In 1413 John XXIII granted the university extensive special privileges, such as university jurisdiction and tax exempt status. Political, geographical, and educational circumstances in the latter part of the university's existence caused it to seek favour from Paris rather than Rome for protection. During the chaos of the French Revolution the university started to gradually disappear and, in 1792, the university was abandoned and closed.\nModern university.\nA university annex of the \"Facult\u00e9 des Sciences d'Aix-Marseille\" was opened in Avignon in 1963. Over the next 20 years various changes were made to the provision of tertiary education in the town until finally in 1984 the \"Universit\u00e9 d'Avignon et des Pays de Vaucluse\" was created. This was nearly 200 years after the demise of the original Avignon university. The main campus lies to the east of the city centre within the city walls. The university occupies the 18th century buildings of the \"H\u00f4pital Sainte-Marthe\". The main building has an elegant fa\u00e7ade with a central portico. The right hand side was designed by Jean-Baptiste Franque and built between 1743 and 1745. Franque was assisted by his son Fran\u00e7ois in the design of the portico. The hospital moved out in the 1980s and, after major works, the building opened for students in 1997. In 2009\u20132010 there were 7,125 students registered at the university.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "38168", "revid": "1319331726", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=38168", "title": "Mecklenburg-Vorpommern", "text": "State in Germany\nMecklenburg-Vorpommern (MV; or ; ), also known by its anglicized name Mecklenburg\u2013Western Pomerania, is a state in the north-east of Germany. Of the country's sixteen states, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern ranks 14th in population; it covers an area of , making it the sixth largest German state in area; and it is 16th in population density. Schwerin is the state capital and Rostock is the largest city. Other major cities include Neubrandenburg, Stralsund, Greifswald, Wismar, and G\u00fcstrow. It was named after the two regions of Mecklenburg and Western Pomerania (German: Vorpommern).\nThe state was established in 1945 after World War II through the merger of the historic regions of Mecklenburg and Prussian Western Pomerania by the Soviet military administration in Allied-occupied Germany. It became part of the German Democratic Republic in 1949, but was dissolved in 1952 during administrative reforms and its territory divided into the districts of Rostock, Schwerin, and Neubrandenburg. Mecklenburg-Vorpommern was re-established in 1990 following German reunification and became one of the new states of the Federal Republic of Germany.\nOn the state's coastline on the Baltic Sea are many holiday resorts and much unspoilt nature, including the islands of R\u00fcgen, Usedom, and others, as well as the Mecklenburg Lake District, making the state one of Germany's leading tourist destinations. Three of Germany's fourteen national parks, as well as several hundred nature conservation areas, are in the state. The University of Rostock, founded in 1419, and the University of Greifswald, established in 1456, are among the oldest universities in Europe. In 2007, the 33rd G8 summit took place at the Grand Hotel Heiligendamm on the Mecklenburg Baltic coast during the chancellorship of Angela Merkel, who represented various constituencies of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern in the national legislature, the Bundestag.\nName.\nDue to its lengthy name, the state is often abbreviated as \"MV\" or (colloquially) shortened to \"MeckPomm\". In English, it is usually called \"Mecklenburg\u2013Western Pomerania\" or less frequently \"Mecklenburg\u2013Cispomerania.\" Inhabitants are called either \"Mecklenburger\" or \"Pomeranians\"; the combined form is never used.\nThe place name \"Vorpommern\" derives from West Slavic languages. The prefix \"po-\" means \"along\" or \"at\", and the base word \"more\" means \"sea\", so that together \"po more\" means \"Land at the Sea\". The German prefix \"vor-\" denotes a closer location; from the German point of view, this is the near part of Pomerania.\nThe full name in German is pronounced . Sometimes, \"Mecklenburg\" is pronounced , because the digraph \u27e8ck\u27e9 marks a preceding short vowel in High German. However, Mecklenburg is within the historical Low German language area, and the \u27e8c\u27e9 appeared in its name during the period of transition to Standard, High German usage (Low German authors wrote the name \"Meklenborg\" or \"M\u0119klenborg\", depicting proper Low German pronunciation, which itself was a syncope of Middle Low German \"Mekelenborg\"). The introduction of the \u27e8c\u27e9 is explained as follows: Either the \u27e8c\u27e9 signals the stretched pronunciation of the preceding \u27e8e\u27e9 (\"Dehnungs-c\"), or it signals the pronunciation of the subsequent \u27e8k\u27e9 as an occlusive to prevent it from falsely being rendered as a fricative following a Low German trend. Another explanation is that the \u27e8c\u27e9 comes from a mannerism in High German officialese of writing unnecessary letters, a so-called \"Letternh\u00e4ufelung\" (lit.\u2009'letter accumulation', as was done sometimes in English with words such as \"doubt\").\nHistory.\nIn the aftermath of the Second World War and German reunification in 1990, the state was constituted from the historic region of Mecklenburg and Western Pomerania, both of which had long and rich independent histories.\nPrehistory.\nHuman settlement in the area of modern Mecklenburg and Vorpommern began after the Ice Age, about 10,000 BC. About two thousand years ago, Germanic peoples were recorded in the area. Most of them left during the Migration Period, heading towards Spain, Italy, and France, leaving the area relatively deserted. In the sixth century Polabian Slavs populated the area. While Mecklenburg was settled by the Obotrites, Pomerania was settled by the Veleti (later \"Liuticians\") and the Rani.\nAlong the coast, Vikings and Slavs established trade posts like Reric, Ralswiek and Menzlin. In the early 12th century, Hither Pomerania passed under Polish suzerainty under Boles\u0142aw III Wrymouth, who initiated Christianization, entrusting this task to Otto of Bamberg. In the late 12th century, Mecklenburg and Hither Pomerania were conquered by Henry the Lion and briefly incorporated into the Duchy of Saxony, joining the Holy Roman Empire in the 1180s. Parts of Mecklenburg and Pomerania were settled with Germans in the \"Ostsiedlung\" process, starting in the 12th century.\nMecklenburg.\nIn the late 12th century, Henry the Lion, Duke of the Saxons, conquered the Obotrites, subjugated its Nikloting dynasty, and Christianized its people. In the course of time, German monks, nobility, peasants and traders arrived to settle here. After the 12th century, the territory remained stable and relatively independent of its neighbours; one of the few German territories for which this is true. Mecklenburg first became a duchy of the Holy Roman Empire in 1348. Though later partitioned and re-partitioned within the same dynasty, Mecklenburg always shared a common history and identity. The states of Mecklenburg-Schwerin and Mecklenburg-Strelitz became Grand Duchies in 1815, and in 1870 they voluntarily joined the new German Empire, while retaining their own internal autonomy. After the First World War and the abdication of the German Kaiser, the monarchies of the duchies were abolished and republican governments of both Mecklenburg states were established, until the Nazi government merged the two states into a unified state of Mecklenburg, a virtually meaningless administrative decision under the centralised regime.\nWestern Pomerania.\nVorpommern, literally Fore-Pomerania, is the smaller, western part of the former Prussian Province of Pomerania; the eastern part became part of Poland after the end of World War II.\nSince the Middle Ages, the area was ruled by the Pomeranian dukes as part of the Duchy of Pomerania. The duchy was established as a vassal state of Poland in 1121, which it remained until 1138. Afterwards the Dukes of Pomerania were independent, and later were vassals of Saxony from 1164 to 1181, of the Holy Roman Empire from 1181 to 1185, of Denmark from 1185 to 1227 and finally, from 1227 on, staying with the Holy Roman Empire. Fore Pomerania was under Swedish rule after the Peace of Westphalia from 1648 until 1815 as Swedish Pomerania. It became a province of Prussia after the Congress of Vienna in 1815 and remained so until 1945.\nMecklenburg-Vorpommern.\nWartime.\nIn May 1945, the armies of the Soviet Union and the Western allies met east of Schwerin. Following the Potsdam Agreement, the Western allies handed over Mecklenburg to the Soviets. Mecklenburg-West Pomerania was established on 9 July 1945, by order No. 5 of Red Army Marshal Georgy Zhukov, head of the Soviet Military Administration in Germany (SMAD), as the \"Province of Mecklenburg and West Pomerania (zapadnoi Pomeranii)\".\nDuring the war, the make-up of Mecklenburg and Vorpommern's population changed, due to wartime losses and the influx of evacuees (mainly from the Berlin and Hamburg metropolitan areas that were subject to air raids). After the war, people who fled and were expelled from the former eastern territories of Germany east of the Oder-Neisse line settled in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern (and elsewhere in Germany), increasing the population by 40%. Before the war, Mecklenburg and Western Pomerania had a population of 1,278,700, of whom many perished during the war and others moved west in the course of the Red Army's advance. In 1947, some 1,426,000 refugees from the former eastern parts of Germany were counted. Most of them settled in rural communities, but the urban population also increased, most notably in Schwerin from 65,000 (1939) to 99,518 (January 1947), in Wismar from 29,463 to 44,173, and in Greifswald from 29,488 to 43,897. Western Pomerania was additionally stripped of the area around the Pomeranian regional capital Stettin/Szczecin as well as the city itself, despite its location to the west of the river Oder.\nGerman Democratic Republic.\nOn 5 June 1946, a law enacted by the Soviets constituted a provisional German administration (\"Beratende Versammlung\", ) under Soviet supervision on 29 June 1946. After elections on 20 October 1946, a \"Landtag\" replaced the \"Beratende Versammlung\" and created the constitution of 16 January 1947, for the \"Land Mecklenburg-Vorpommern\". On 18 April 1947, the state's name was shortened to \"Land Mecklenburg\". Mecklenburg became a constituent state (\"Land\") of the German Democratic Republic (GDR) upon its formation in 1949. In 1952, the East German government abandoned the term \"Land\" in this context and redesignated its administrative territorial divisions as \"districts\" (German: \"Bezirke\"). The territory of Mecklenburg and Vorpommern was divided into three districts that covered roughly the same area: \"Bezirk Rostock\", \"Bezirk Schwerin\" and \"Bezirk Neubrandenburg\". These were commonly known as the \"Nordbezirke\" (northern districts) under the highly centralised GDR government. The East German government developed the shipyards in the old Hanseatic ports (the largest being in Rostock and Stralsund), and also established the Greifswald Nuclear Power Plant in Lubmin near Greifswald.\nReunification.\nAt the time of German reunification in 1990, the eastern states were reconstituted along their postwar boundaries (with minor adjustments) as they had existed until 1952, and the historic name Mecklenburg-Vorpommern was restored. Since 1990, the state has undergone dramatic changes. What had been largely an industrial and agricultural economy is increasingly driven by the service, tourism, and high-tech sectors. The old towns, hundreds of castles and manors, resort buildings, windmills, churches, and various other cultural monuments of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern have been renovated in recent years. Since 2013, net migration into the state has been positive again.\nGeography.\nLocation and urban areas.\nSixth-largest in area and fourteenth in overall population among Germany's sixteen Bundesl\u00e4nder (federal states), Mecklenburg-Vorpommern is bounded to the north by the Baltic Sea, to the west by Schleswig-Holstein, to the southwest by Lower Saxony, to the south by Brandenburg, and to the east by the West Pomeranian Voivodeship in Poland.\nMecklenburg-Vorpommern's state capital is Schwerin. The largest city is Rostock with approximately 205,000 people, followed by Schwerin. Other major cities include Neubrandenburg, Stralsund, Greifswald, Wismar and G\u00fcstrow.\nDistricts.\nSince 4 September 2011, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern is divided into six \"Kreise\" (districts):\nAlso counting two independent urban districts:\nLandscape.\nThe state's Baltic Sea coast is about long and features several islands, most notably Germany's two biggest islands R\u00fcgen and Usedom, but also a number of smaller islands such as Hiddensee and Poel. Mecklenburg-Vorpommern's varied coastline also has many peninsulas such as Fischland-Dar\u00df-Zingst and various lagoons (also known as \"Bodden\" or \"Haff\").\nA total of 283 nature reserves, 110 landscape reserves and three of Germany's fourteen national parks are scattered all over the state.\nLakes.\nThe southern part of the state is characterized by a multitude of lakes within the Mecklenburg Lakeland, the largest of which is Lake M\u00fcritz (also the largest German lake), followed by Lake Schwerin, Plauer See and Lake Kummerow. The \"land of a thousand lakes\" (German: \"Land der tausend Seen\") is hallmarked by its unspoilt nature. Due to its clean air and idyllic setting, medical tourism has become a notable tourism sector in the region.\nCulture.\nOver the centuries, Mecklenburg and Vorpommern have developed and maintained strong regional cultures. It can generally be described as North German and has similar linguistic and historic characteristics to other north German states, such as Schleswig-Holstein. People in Vorpommern, as a result of that territory being a former province of Prussia, tend to look slightly more towards Berlin and Brandenburg than people in Mecklenburg would.\nArchitecture.\nThe cities are characterised by a certain \"Hanseatic\" style also found in other parts of northern Germany (e.g. L\u00fcbeck) as well as in countries bordering the Baltic Sea like Estonia (e.g. Tallinn) or Latvia (e.g. Riga). A common feature of many towns in Mecklenburg and Vorpommern are red Brick Gothic churches and houses dating back to the Middle Ages. Also stepped and tailed gables are a typical feature of the Hanseatic old towns, such as Stralsund, Wismar and Greifswald.\nThe old towns are usually built around one or several market places with a church or the town hall. Often towns were founded at the Baltic Sea, one of the many lakes or a river for logistical and trade motives.\nRural areas of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern are often characterized by Brick Gothic village and agricultural heritage, like brick homesteads, thatched roof houses, windmills, manor houses and castles.\nMuseums, art and theatres.\nThe largest publicly funded theatres in the state are the Mecklenburg State Theatre, the Rostock People's Theatre, the Theatre of West Pomerania, with venues in Stralsund, Putbus and Greifswald, and the Mecklenburg State Theatre of Neustrelitz with venues in Neubrandenburg and Neustrelitz. All four theatres offer both drama and musical theatre as well as orchestral music.\nOther important theatres are the Ernst Barlach Theatre of G\u00fcstrow, the Theatre of Parchim, the Anklam Theatre and the Wismar Theatre.\nThere are also many small theatres on the Baltic coast and in individual artist's villages and resorts (e.g. the popular concert pavilions at the Baltic Sea). Since its growing importance for summer tourism, open-air theatres and festivals become more common again as well, such as the St\u00f6rtebeker Festival on the island of R\u00fcgen, and the \"Vineta Festival\" on Usedom.\nSince 1993, the St\u00f6rtebeker Festival has taken place in Ralswiek on the island of R\u00fcgen. It is Germany's most successful open-air theatre.\nNotable museums include, for example, the Schwerin State Museum and the Pomeranian State Museum at Greifswald. The German Oceanographic Museum with its Ozeaneum in Stralsund is the most popular museum in northern Germany. Furthermore, the German Amber Museum in Ribnitz-Damgarten, Rostock's Abbey of the Holy Cross and Rostock Art Gallery are of national importance. The oldest museum in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania is Stralsund's Cultural History Museum, the smallest is the Professor Wandschneider Sculpture Museum in Plau am See.\nMecklenburg-Vorpommern is home to many cultural events throughout the year. During summer, many open-air concerts and operas are open to visitors. The Mecklenburg-Vorpommern Festival (\"Festspiele Mecklenburg-Vorpommern\") attracts a sizeable audience by performing classical concerts in parks, churches and castles.\nCaspar David Friedrich, a famous romanticist painter born in Greifswald, immortalised parts of the state in several of his paintings.\nLanguage.\nToday the vast majority of people speak Standard German; a few centuries ago most people spoke Low German (German: \"Plattdeutsch\" or \"Niederdeutsch\"), a language that is still kept alive within various communities and cultural events.\nFood and drinks.\nLike most German regions, Mecklenburg and Vorpommern have their own traditional dishes, often including fish, beef and pork. Rostock has its own type of bratwurst called \"Rostocker Bratwurst\". A famous dish from Western Pomerania is Bismarck Herring. Rote Gr\u00fctze is a popular dessert. The largest beer breweries are \"Mecklenburgische Brauerei L\u00fcbz\" (L\u00fcbzer Pils), \"Hanseatische Brauerei Rostock\", \"Darguner Brauerei\" and \"St\u00f6rtebeker Braumanufaktur\" (Stralsund, multiple winner of the World Beer Cup). Besides, there are many smaller breweries and craft beer variations, such as the \"Mellenthin Castle Beer\" from Usedom Island.\nReligion.\nAs of 2020, the majority (82.4%) of the citizens of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania are not religious or adhere to other religions. 14.2% are members of the Protestant Church in Germany and 3.4% of the Catholic Church.\nFollowing the Reformation, led in Germany by Martin Luther, as well as a period of Swedish rule, the traditional faith in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern is Protestantism, specifically Lutheranism. There are also a number of Catholics and people of other faiths.\nIn May 2012 the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Mecklenburg merged with North Elbian Evangelical Lutheran Church and Pomeranian Evangelical Church into the new Evangelical Lutheran Church in Northern Germany.\nSome parishes of the state belong to Evangelical Church of Berlin and Brandenburg.\nThere are also Jewish communities, in the state capital of Schwerin (including Wismar) and in the city of Rostock. Historically, there were also synagogues in smaller towns, of which some are still preserved (like R\u00f6bel, Krakow am See and Boizenburg). The state's Jewish organisation is part of the Central Council of Jews in Germany.\nImmigration.\nLargest groups of foreign residents by 31 December 2023:\nEducation.\nUniversities and colleges.\nMecklenburg-Vorpommern has the two oldest universities of the Baltic Sea region, also among the oldest of Germany and all of Europe:\nAlso, there are further colleges / technological universities:\nSchools.\nThe state's school system is centralised. There are two main types of schools, \"Regionalschule\" (for the majority of pupils) and \"Gymnasium\" (for the top 30% of each year's students, leading to the university entrance qualification \"Abitur\"). Besides, there are also independent schools, comprehensive schools and trade schools.\nPolitics.\nArticle 20 of the State Constitution states that the Landtag is the \"site of political decision-making\". The Mecklenburg-Vorpommern Landtag is elected democratically by the citizens of the state and sits for a 5-year legislative period. The seat of the Landtag is located at Schwerin Palace in Schwerin. The essential functions of the Landtag are to elect the Minister-President of the state; to discuss and decide on laws which have been proposed by the government, by any four members of the Landtag, or a people's initiative or petition for a referendum initiated directly by the people; and to control the state government.\nMinister-President.\nThe executive is led by a cabinet, in turn led by a Minister-President, who is the official head of state and government. The election to determine the Minister-President is held no later than four weeks after the newly elected Landtag is convened.\nLandtag.\nThe last election of the Landtag of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern took place on 26 September 2021. The SPD won a landslide plurality of almost 40% of votes, a nine percentage point increase from 2016. The opposition Alternative for Germany (AfD) remained the second largest party but declined to under 17%. The CDU recorded its worst ever result in the state with 13.3%, while The Left also declined to 10%. Alliance 90/The Greens and the Free Democratic Party (FDP) both won around 6% of votes and re-entered the Landtag after previously falling out in 2016 and 2011, respectively.\nThe Landtag has been led by Minister President Manuela Schwesig since 2017.\nOn 13 October 2021, Schwesig announced the SPD would enter coalition talks with The Left. She stated her motivations for reorienting the coalition as a desire for \"a new departure\", and described The Left as a \"social, pragmatic party\" with decisive policy overlap with the SPD. She said that The Left had been a reliable partner to the government even while in opposition, and had assumed \"state-political responsibility\" during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nOn 5 November 2021, the SPD and The Left agreed to a coalition government and plan to form a cabinet, which is to be approved by each party-congress by mid-November.\nEconomy.\nThe gross domestic product (GDP) of the state was 44.5 billion euros in 2018, accounting for 1.3% of German economic output. GDP per capita adjusted for purchasing power was 25,400 euros or 84% of the EU27 average in the same year. The GDP per employee was 83% of the EU average. The GDP per capita was the lowest of all German states.\nLabour market.\nMecklenburg-Vorpommern is the least densely populated and least industrial German state, being the sixth largest in area, but only the 14th in population. Formerly, unemployment has been negatively affected by the breakdown of non-competitive former GDR industries after the German reunification in the 1990s. As of 2018 unemployment is the lowest in more than 15 years while the economy is growing and the number of jobs is increasing continually. Growing sectors are biotechnology, information technology, life sciences, maritime industry and tourist services.\nIn Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, approximately 732,200 people were gainfully employed in 2008 with 657,100 of them were white and blue collar workers. About 4,200 new jobs were created in 2007. Employees worked an average of 1,455 hours a year. The number of self-employed did not change in 2008. Three out of every four of all workers are employed in the service sector. In October 2018 the unemployment rate stood at 7.1% and was the third highest rate in Germany.\nTourism.\nMecklenburg-Vorpommern is the top destination for intra-German tourism and is gaining importance for international tourism.\nThe main tourist regions are:\nAs a reminder of its rich history, nearly 2,000 castles, palaces and manor houses exist in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, many of which are used as venues for public events like concerts and festivals, such as Festspiele MV (a classical music festival).\nMedical tourism based on the clean air and idyllic settings by the Baltic Sea has a growing importance to the regional tourism industry.\nTransport.\nThere are two airports that are currently operating in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern which are Rostock\u2013Laage Airport and Heringsdorf Airport. However, residents of the state also use Berlin Brandenburg Airport and Hamburg Airport, which both can be easily reached by train and car.\nSport.\nMain sporting attractions include the German football league games of F.C. Hansa Rostock and the international sailing event Hanse Sail. If the bid for the 2012 summer Olympics in Leipzig had been successful, the sailing competitions would have taken place off the coast of Rostock.\nNotable people.\nNotable from Mecklenburg-Vorpommern include:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The term is sometimes used to describe a broad continuum of sexual orientation between heterosexuality and bisexuality. Such continuums include mostly heterosexual or mostly homosexual, but these can be self-identified without identifying as bisexual.\nThe terms \"heteroflexible\" and \"homoflexible\" are mainly applied to bi-curious people, though some authors distinguish heteroflexibility and homoflexibility as lacking the \"wish to experiment with sexuality\" implied by the bi-curious label. It is important when discussing this continuum to conclude that bisexuality is distinct from heterosexuality and homosexuality rather than simply an extension of said sexualities like the labels \"heteroflexibility\" and \"homoflexibility\" would imply, due to the prominent erasure and assimilation of bisexuality into other identity groups. To sum it up, the difference between bisexual and bicurious is that bisexual people know that they are sexually attracted to both genders based on personal experience. Bicurious people are still maneuvering their way through their sexuality.\nBi-curious is not to be confused with forms of sexual fluidity, defined as a \"capacity for situation-dependent flexibility in sexual responsiveness,\" as bi-curious implies the existence of one set sexuality for the individual who carries the label, even if it is currently unknown, rather than an acknowledgment that the individual's sexual preference has changed and will continue to change that comes with sexual fluidity.\nBi-curiosity and other non-monosexual identities.\nStandard theories of bi-sexuality make use of the term bisexual umbrella to encompass multiple other non-monosexual identities (sexual identities that allow for multiple gender identity possibilities in partners) that are possible outcomes of exploration for bi-curious people. However, similar on the surface, bisexuality and the subsequent elements of its umbrella are distinct, thus leading to the possibility that a currently bi-curious person may end up as neither bisexual, homosexual, or heterosexual, but another non-monosexual identity altogether. This umbrella can be better broken into further sexual identities, with bisexuality normally including two groups that encompass attraction to the persons own gender and other genders (which will usually include non-binary gender identities too). At the same time, pansexuality includes attraction to an individual regardless of what gender identity they label themselves. The relevance to a bi-curious person is at what range does their exploration end.\nEtymology.\nThe term started becoming popular after 1984, according to Merriam-Webster, but \"The New Partridge Dictionary of Slang and Unconventional English\" and \"Oxford Dictionaries' Lexico\" claim that the term was coined in 1990. According to Dictionary.com, the term was first used between 1980 and 1985.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "38172", "revid": "16185737", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=38172", "title": "Igor Stravinsky", "text": "Russian composer (1882\u20131971)\nIgor Fyodorovich Stravinsky (17 June\u00a0[O.S. 5 June]\u00a01882 \u2013 6 April 1971) was a Russian composer and conductor with French citizenship (from 1934) and American citizenship (from 1945). He is widely considered one of the most important and influential composers of the 20th century and a pivotal figure in modernist music.\nBorn to a musical family in Saint Petersburg, Russia, Stravinsky grew up taking piano and music theory lessons. While studying law at the University of Saint Petersburg, he met Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov and studied music under him until the latter's death in 1908. Stravinsky met the impresario Sergei Diaghilev soon after, who commissioned the composer to write three ballets for the Ballets Russes's Paris seasons: \"The Firebird\" (1910), \"Petrushka\" (1911), and \"The Rite of Spring\" (1913), the last of which caused a near-riot at the premiere due to its avant-garde nature and later changed the way composers understood rhythmic structure.\nStravinsky's compositional career is often divided into three main periods: his Russian period (1913\u20131920), his neoclassical period (1920\u20131951), and his serial period (1954\u20131968). During his Russian period, Stravinsky was heavily influenced by Russian styles and folklore. Works such as \"Renard\" (1916) and (1923) drew upon Russian folk poetry, while compositions like (1918) integrated these folk elements with popular musical forms, including the tango, waltz, ragtime, and chorale. His neoclassical period exhibited themes and techniques from the classical period, like the use of the sonata form in his Octet (1923) and use of Greek mythological themes in works including (1927), \"Oedipus rex\" (1927), and \"Persephone\" (1935). In his serial period, Stravinsky turned towards compositional techniques from the Second Viennese School like Arnold Schoenberg's twelve-tone technique. \"In Memoriam Dylan Thomas\" (1954) was the first of his compositions to be fully based on the technique, and (1956) was his first to be based on a tone row. Stravinsky's last major work was the \"Requiem Canticles\" (1966), which was performed at his funeral.\nWhile many supporters were confused by Stravinsky's constant stylistic changes, later writers recognized his versatile language as important in the development of modernist music. Stravinsky's revolutionary ideas influenced composers as diverse as Aaron Copland, Philip Glass, B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k, and Pierre Boulez, who were all challenged to innovate music in areas beyond tonality, especially rhythm and musical form. In 1998, \"Time\" magazine listed Stravinsky as one of the of the century. Stravinsky died of pulmonary edema on 6 April 1971 in New York City, having left six memoirs written with his friend and assistant Robert Craft, as well as an earlier autobiography and a series of lectures.\nLife.\nEarly life in Russia, 1882\u20131901.\nIgor Fyodorovich Stravinsky was born in Oranienbaum, Russia\u2014a town later renamed Lomonosov, about thirty miles (fifty kilometers) west of Saint Petersburg\u2014on 17 June\u00a0[O.S. 5 June]\u00a01882. His mother, Anna Kirillovna Stravinskaya (n\u00e9e Kholodovskaya), was an amateur singer and pianist from an established family of landowners. His father, Fyodor Ignatyevich Stravinsky, was a famous bass at the Mariinsky Theatre in Saint Petersburg, descended from a line of Polish landowners. The name \"Stravinsky\" is of Polish origin, deriving from the Strava river in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. The family was originally called \"Soulima-Stravinsky\", bearing the Soulima arms, but \"Soulima\" was dropped after Russia's annexation during the partitions of Poland.\nOranienbaum, the composer's birthplace, was where his family vacationed during summers; their primary residence was an apartment along the Kryukov Canal in central Saint Petersburg, near the Mariinsky Theatre. Stravinsky was baptized hours after birth and joined to the Russian Orthodox Church in St. Nicholas Cathedral. Constantly in fear of his short-tempered father and indifferent towards his mother, Igor lived there for the first 27 years of his life with three siblings: Roman and Yury, his older siblings who irritated him immensely, and Gury, his close younger brother with whom he said he found \"the love and understanding denied us by our parents\". Igor was educated by the family's governess until age eleven, when he began attending the Second Saint Petersburg Gymnasium, a school he recalled hating because he had few friends.\nFrom age nine, Stravinsky studied privately with a piano teacher. He later wrote that his parents saw no musical talent in him due to his lack of technical skills; the young pianist frequently improvised instead of practicing assigned pieces. Stravinsky's excellent sight-reading skill prompted him to frequently read vocal scores from his father's vast personal library. At around age ten, he began regularly attending performances at the Mariinsky Theatre, where he was introduced to Russian repertoire as well as Italian and French opera; by sixteen, he attended rehearsals at the theater five or six days a week. By age fourteen, Stravinsky had mastered the solo part of Mendelssohn's Piano Concerto No. 1, and at age fifteen, he transcribed for solo piano a string quartet by Alexander Glazunov.\nHigher education, 1901\u20131909.\nStudent compositions.\nDespite his musical passion and ability, Stravinsky's parents expected him to study law at the University of Saint Petersburg, and he enrolled there in 1901. However, according to his own account, he was a bad student and attended few of the optional lectures. In exchange for agreeing to attend law school, his parents allowed for lessons in harmony and counterpoint. At university, Stravinsky befriended Vladimir Rimsky-Korsakov, son of the leading Russian composer Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov. During summer vacation of 1902, Stravinsky traveled with Vladimir Rimsky-Korsakov to Heidelberg \u2013 where the latter's family was staying \u2013 bringing a portfolio of pieces to demonstrate to Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov. While the elder composer was not stunned, he was impressed enough to insist that Stravinsky continue lessons but advised against him entering the Saint Petersburg Conservatory due to its rigorous environment. Importantly, Rimsky-Korsakov agreed personally to advise Stravinsky on his compositions.\nAfter Stravinsky's father died in 1902 and the young composer became more independent, he became increasingly involved in Rimsky-Korsakov's circle of artists. His first major task from his new teacher was the four-movement Piano Sonata in F-sharp minor in the style of Glazunov and Tchaikovsky \u2013 he paused temporarily to write a cantata for Rimsky-Korsakov's 60th birthday celebration, which the elder composer described as \"not bad\". Soon after finishing the sonata, the student began his large-scale Symphony in E-flat, the first draft of which he finished in 1905. That year, the dedicatee of the Piano Sonata, Nikolay Richter, performed it at a recital hosted by the Rimsky-Korsakovs, marking the first public premiere of a Stravinsky piece.\nAfter the events of Bloody Sunday in January 1905 caused the university to close, Stravinsky was not able to take his final exams, resulting in his graduation with a half-diploma. As he began spending more time in Rimsky-Korsakov's circle of artists, the young composer became increasingly cramped in the stylistically conservative atmosphere: modern music was questioned, and concerts of contemporary music were looked down upon. The group occasionally attended chamber concerts oriented to modern music, and while Rimsky-Korsakov and his colleague Anatoly Lyadov hated attending, Stravinsky remembered the concerts as intriguing and intellectually stimulating, being the first place he was exposed to French composers like Franck, Dukas, Faur\u00e9, and Debussy. Nevertheless, Stravinsky remained loyal to Rimsky-Korsakov \u2013 the musicologist Eric Walter White suspected that the composer believed compliance with Rimsky-Korsakov was necessary to succeed in the Russian music world. Stravinsky later wrote that his teachers' musical conservatism was justified, and helped him build the foundation that would become the base of his style.\nFirst marriage.\nIn August 1905, Stravinsky announced his engagement to Yekaterina Nosenko, his first cousin whom he had met in 1890 during a family trip. He later recalled:From our first hour together we both seemed to realize that we would one day marry\u2014or so we told each other later. Perhaps we were always more like brother and sister. I was a deeply lonely child and I wanted a sister of my own. Catherine, who was my first cousin, came into my life as a kind of long-wanted sister... We were from then until her death extremely close, and closer than lovers sometimes are, for mere lovers may be strangers though they live and love together all their lives... Catherine was my dearest friend and playmate ... until we grew into our marriage.The two had grown close during family trips, encouraging each other's interest in painting and drawing, swimming together often, going on wild raspberry picks, helping build a tennis court, playing piano duet music, and later organizing group readings with their other cousins of books and political tracts from Fyodor Stravinsky's personal library. In July 1901, Stravinsky expressed infatuation with Lyudmila Kuxina, Nosenko's best friend, but after the self-described \"summer romance\" had ended, Nosenko and Stravinsky's relationship began developing into a furtive romance. Between their intermittent family visits, Nosenko studied painting at the Acad\u00e9mie Colarossi in Paris. The two married on 24 January 1906, at the Church of the Annunciation five miles (eight kilometers) north of Saint Petersburg \u2013 because marriage between first cousins was banned, they procured a priest who did not ask their identities, and the only guests present were Rimsky-Korsakov's sons. The couple soon had two children: Th\u00e9odore, born in 1907, and Ludmila, born the following year.\nAfter finishing the many revisions of the Symphony in E-flat in 1907, Stravinsky wrote \"Faun and Shepherdess\", a setting of three Pushkin poems for mezzo-soprano and orchestra. Rimsky-Korsakov organized the first public premiere of his student's work with the Imperial Court Orchestra in April 1907, programming the Symphony in E-flat and \"Faun and Shepherdess\". Rimsky-Korsakov's death in June 1908 caused Stravinsky deep mourning, and he later recalled that \"Funeral Song\", which he composed in memory of his teacher, was \"the best of my works before \"The Firebird\"\".\nInternational fame, 1909\u20131920.\nBallets for Diaghilev.\nIn 1898, the impresario Sergei Diaghilev founded the Russian art magazine \"Mir iskusstva\", but after it ended publication in 1904, he turned towards Paris for artistic opportunities rather than his native Russia. In 1907, Diaghilev presented a five-concert series of Russian music at the Paris Opera; the following year, he staged the Paris premiere of Rimsky-Korsakov's version of \"Boris Godunov\". Diaghilev attended the February 1909 premiere of two new Stravinsky works: \"Scherzo fantastique\" and \"Feu d'artifice\", both lively orchestral movements featuring bright orchestration and unique harmonic techniques. The vivid color and tone of Stravinsky's works intrigued Diaghilev, and the impresario subsequently commissioned Stravinsky to orchestrate music by Chopin for parts of the ballet \".\" This ballet was presented by Diaghilev's ballet company, the Ballets Russes, in April 1909, and while the company scored successes with Parisian audiences, Stravinsky was working on Act I of his first opera \"The Nightingale\".\nAs the Ballets Russes faced financial issues, Diaghilev wanted a new ballet with distinctly Russian music and design, something that had recently become popular with French and other Western audiences (likely due to the group of Russian classical composers known as The Five, according to the musicologist Richard Taruskin); Diaghilev's company settled on the subject of the mythical Firebird. Diaghilev asked multiple composers to write the ballet's score, including Lyadov and Nikolai Tcherepnin, but after none committed to the project, the impresario turned to the 27-year-old Stravinsky, who gladly accepted the task. During the ballet's production, Stravinsky became close with Diaghilev's artistic circle, who were impressed by his enthusiasm to learn more about non-musical art forms. \"The Firebird\" premiered in Paris (as ) on 25 June 1910 to widespread critical acclaim, and made Stravinsky an overnight sensation. Many critics praised the composer's alignment with Russian nationalist music. Stravinsky later recollected that after the premiere and subsequent performances, he met many figures in the Paris art scene; Debussy was brought on stage after the premiere and invited Stravinsky to dinner, beginning a lifelong friendship between the two composers.\nThe Stravinsky family moved to Lausanne, Switzerland, for the birth of their third child, Soulima, and it was there that Stravinsky began work on a \"\" for piano and orchestra depicting the tale of a puppet coming to life. After Diaghilev heard the early drafts, he convinced Stravinsky to turn it into a ballet for the 1911 season. The resulting work, \"Petrushka\" (under the French spelling \"Petrouchka\"), premiered in Paris on 13 June 1911 to equal acclaim as \"The Firebird\", and Stravinsky became established as one of the most advanced young theater composers of his time.\nWhile composing \"The Firebird\", Stravinsky conceived an idea for a work about what he called \"a solemn pagan rite: sage elders, seated in a circle, watched a young girl dance herself to death\". He immediately shared the idea with Nicholas Roerich, a friend and painter of pagan subjects. When Stravinsky told Diaghilev about the idea, the impresario excitedly agreed to commission the work. After the premiere of \"Petrushka\", Stravinsky settled at his family's residence in Ustilug and fleshed out the details of the ballet with Roerich, later finishing the work in Clarens, Switzerland. The result was \"The Rite of Spring\" (), which depicted pagan rituals in Slavonic tribes and used many avant-garde techniques, including uneven rhythms and meters, superimposed harmonies, atonality, and extensive instrumentation. With radical choreography by the young Vaslav Nijinsky, the ballet's experimental nature caused a near-riot at its premiere at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre des Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es on 29 May 1913.\nIllness and wartime collaborations.\nSoon after, Stravinsky was admitted to a hospital for typhoid fever and stayed in recovery for five weeks; numerous colleagues visited him, including Debussy, Manuel de Falla, Maurice Ravel, and Florent Schmitt. Upon returning to his family in Ustilug, he continued work on his opera \"The Nightingale\", with an official commission from the Moscow Free Theatre. In early 1914, his wife Yekaterina contracted tuberculosis and was admitted to a sanatorium in Leysin, Switzerland, where the couple's fourth child, Maria Milena, was born. Here Stravinsky finished \"The Nightingale\", but after the Moscow Free Theatre closed before the premiere, Diaghilev agreed to stage the opera. The May 1914 premiere was moderately successful; critics' high expectations after the tumultuous \"Rite of Spring\" were not met, though fellow composers were impressed by the music's emotion and free treatment of counterpoint and themes.\nIn early July 1914, while his family resided in Switzerland near his sick wife, the composer traveled to Russia to retrieve texts for his next work, a ballet-cantata depicting Russian wedding traditions titled . Soon after he returned, World War I began, and the Stravinskys lived in Switzerland until 1920, initially residing in Clarens and later Morges. During the first months of the war, the composer intensely researched Russian folk poetry and prepared librettos for numerous works to be composed in the coming years, including ', \"Renard\", , and other song cycles. Stravinsky met numerous Swiss-French artists during his time in Morges, including the author Charles F. Ramuz, with whom he collaborated on the small-scale theater work '. The eleven-musician and two-dancer show was designed for easy travel, but after a premiere run funded by Werner Reinhart, all other performances were canceled due to the Spanish flu epidemic.\nStravinsky's income from performance royalties was suddenly cut off when his Germany-based publisher suspended operations due to the war. To keep his family afloat, the composer sold numerous manuscripts and accepted commissions from wealthy impresarios; one such commission included \"Renard\", a theater work completed in 1916 upon a request from Princesse Edmond de Polignac. Additionally, Stravinsky made a new concert suite from \"The Firebird\" and sold it to a London publisher in an attempt to regain copyright control over the ballet. Diaghilev continued to organize Ballets Russes shows across Europe, including two charity concerts for the Red Cross where Stravinsky made his conducting debut with \"The Firebird\". When the Ballets Russes traveled to Rome in April 1917, Stravinsky met the artist Pablo Picasso, and the two adventured around Italy; a they saw in Naples inspired the ballet \"Pulcinella\", which premiered in Paris in May 1920 with designs by Picasso.\nFrance, 1920\u20131939.\nTurn towards neoclassicism.\nAfter the war ended, Stravinsky decided that his residence in Switzerland was too far from Europe's musical activity, and briefly moved his family to Carantec, France. In September 1920, they relocated to the home of Coco Chanel, an associate of Diaghilev's, where Stravinsky composed his early neoclassical work the \"Symphonies of Wind Instruments.\" After his relationship with Chanel developed into an affair, Stravinsky relocated his family to the white \u00e9migr\u00e9-hub Biarritz in May 1921, partly due to the presence of his other lover Vera de Bosset. At the time, de Bosset was married to the former Ballet Russes stage designer Serge Sudeikin, though de Bosset later divorced Sudeikin to marry Stravinsky. Though Yekaterina Stravinsky became aware of her husband's infidelity, the Stravinskys never divorced, likely due to the composer's refusal to separate.\nIn 1921, Stravinsky signed a contract with the player piano company Pleyel to create piano roll arrangements of his music. He received a studio at their factory on the Rue Rochechouart, where he reorchestrated \"\" for a small ensemble including player piano. The composer transcribed many of his major works for the mechanical pianos, and the Pleyel premises remained his Paris base until 1933, even after the player piano had been largely supplanted by electrical gramophone recording. Stravinsky signed another contract in 1924, this time with the Aeolian Company in London, producing rolls that included comments about the work by Stravinsky that were engraved into the rolls. He stopped working with player pianos in 1930 when the Aeolian Company's London branch was dissolved.\nThe interest in Pushkin shared by Stravinsky and Diaghilev led to \"Mavra\", a comic opera begun in 1921 that exhibited the composer's rejection of Rimsky-Korsakov's style and his turn towards classic Russian operatists like Tchaikovsky, Glinka, and Dargomyzhsky. Yet, after the 1922 premiere, the work's tame nature \u2013 compared to the innovative music Stravinsky had come to be known for \u2013 disappointed critics. In 1923, Stravinsky finished orchestrating \"\", settling on a percussion ensemble including four pianos. The Ballets Russes staged the ballet-cantata that June, and although it initially received moderate reviews, the London production received a flurry of critical attacks, leading the writer H. G. Wells to publish an open letter in support of the work. During this period, Stravinsky expanded his involvement in conducting and piano performance. He conducted the premiere of his Octet in 1923 and served as the soloist for the premiere of his Piano Concerto in 1924. Following its debut, he embarked on a tour, performing the concerto in over 40 concerts.\nReligious crisis and international touring.\nThe Stravinsky family moved again in September 1924 to Nice, France. The composer's schedule was divided between spending time with his family in Nice, performing in Paris, and touring other locations, often accompanied by de Bosset. At this time, Stravinsky was going through a spiritual crisis onset by meeting Father Nicolas, a priest near his new home. He had abandoned the Russian Orthodox Church during his teenage years, but after meeting Father Nicolas in 1926 and reconnecting with his faith, he began regularly attending services. From then until moving to the United States, Stravinsky diligently attended church, participated in charity work, and studied religious texts. The composer later wrote that he was contacted by God at a service at the Basilica of Saint Anthony of Padua, leading him to write his first religious composition, the for a cappella choir.\nIn 1925, Stravinsky asked the French writer and artist Jean Cocteau to write the libretto for an operatic setting of Sophocles' tragedy \"Oedipus Rex\" in Latin. The May 1927 premiere of his opera-oratorio \"Oedipus rex\" was staged as a concert performance since there was too little time and money to present it as a full opera, and Stravinsky attributed the work's critical failure to its programming between two glittery ballets. Furthermore, the influence from Russian Orthodox vocal music and 18th-century composers like Handel was not well received in the press after the May 1927 premiere; neoclassicism was not popular with Parisian critics, and Stravinsky had to publicly assert that his music was not part of the movement. This reception from critics was not improved by Stravinsky's next ballet, \"\", which depicted the birth and apotheosis of Apollo using an 18th-century musical style. George Balanchine choreographed the premiere, beginning decades of collaborations between Stravinsky and the choreographer. Nevertheless, some critics found it to be a turning point in Stravinsky's neoclassical music, describing it as a pure work that blended neoclassical ideas with modern methods of composition.\nA new commission for a ballet from Ida Rubinstein in 1928 led Stravinsky again to Tchaikovsky. Basing the music on romantic ballets like \"Swan Lake\" and borrowing many themes from Tchaikovsky, Stravinsky wrote \"The Fairy's Kiss\" with Hans Christian Andersen's tale \"The Ice-Maiden\" as the subject. The November 1928 premiere was not well-received, likely due to the disconnect between each of the ballet's sections and the mediocre choreography, of which Stravinsky disapproved. Diaghilev's fury with Stravinsky for accepting a ballet commission from someone else caused an intense feud between the two, one that lasted until the impresario's death in August 1929. Most of that year was spent composing a new solo piano work, the Capriccio, and touring across Europe to conduct and perform piano; the Capriccio's success after the December 1929 premiere caused a flurry of performance requests from many orchestras. A commission from the Boston Symphony Orchestra in 1930 for a symphonic work led Stravinsky back to Latin texts, this time from the book of Psalms. Between touring concerts, he composed the choral \"Symphony of Psalms\", a deeply religious work that premiered in December of that year.\nWork with Dushkin.\nWhile touring in Germany, Stravinsky visited his publisher's home and met the violinist Samuel Dushkin, who convinced him to compose the Violin Concerto with Dushkin's help on the solo part. Impressed by Dushkin's virtuosic ability and understanding of music, the composer wrote more music for violin and piano and rearranged some of his earlier music to be performed alongside the Concerto while on tour until 1933. That year, Stravinsky received another ballet commission from Ida Rubenstein for a setting of a poem by Andr\u00e9 Gide. The resulting melodrama only received three performances in 1934 due to its lukewarm reception, and Stravinsky's disdain towards the work was evident in his later suggestion that the libretto be rewritten. In June of that year, Stravinsky became a naturalized French citizen, protecting all his future works under copyright in France and the United States. His family subsequently moved to an apartment on the Rue du Faubourg Saint-Honor\u00e9 in Paris, where he began writing a two-volume autobiography with the help of Walter Nouvel, published in 1935 and 1936 as .\nAfter the short run of \"Pers\u00e9phone\", Stravinsky embarked on a successful three-month tour of the United States with Dushkin; he visited South America for the first time the following year. The composer's son Soulima was an excellent pianist, having performed the Capriccio in concert with his father conducting. Continuing a line of solo piano works, the elder Stravinsky composed the Concerto for Two Pianos to be performed by them both, and they toured the work through 1936. Around this time came three American-commissioned works: the ballet for Balanchine, the \"Brandenburg Concerto\"-like work Dumbarton Oaks, and the lamenting Symphony in C for the Chicago Symphony Orchestra's 50th anniversary. Stravinsky's last years in France from late 1938 to 1939 were marked by the deaths of his eldest daughter, his wife, and his mother, the former two from tuberculosis. In addition, the increasingly hostile criticism of his music in major publications and failed run for a seat at the Institut de France further dissociated him from France, and shortly after the beginning of World War II in September 1939 he moved to the United States.\nUnited States, 1939\u20131971.\nAdjustment to the United States and commercial works.\nUpon arriving in the United States, Stravinsky resided with Edward W. Forbes, the director of the Charles Eliot Norton Lectures series at Harvard University. The composer was contracted to deliver six lectures for the series, beginning in October 1939 and ending in April 1940. The lectures, written with assistance from Pyotr Suvchinsky and Alexis Roland-Manuel, were published in French under the title (\"Poetics of Music\") in 1941, with an English translation following in 1947. Between lectures, Stravinsky finished the Symphony in C and toured across the country, meeting de Bosset upon her arrival in New York. Stravinsky and de Bosset finally married on 9 March 1940 in Bedford, Massachusetts. After the completion of his lecture series, the couple moved to Los Angeles, where they applied for American naturalization.\nMoney became scarce as the war stopped the composer from receiving European royalties, making him take up numerous conducting engagements and compose commercial works for the entertainment industry, including the for Paul Whiteman and the for a Broadway revue. Some discarded film music made it into larger works, as with the war-inspired Symphony in Three Movements, the middle movement of which used music from an unused score for \"The Song of Bernadette\" (1943). The couple's poor English led to the formation of a predominantly European social circle and home life: the estate staff consisted of mostly Russians, and frequent guests included musicians Joseph Szigeti, Arthur Rubinstein, and Sergei Rachmaninoff. However, Stravinsky eventually joined popular Hollywood circles, attending parties with celebrities and becoming closely acquainted with European authors Aldous Huxley, W. H. Auden, Christopher Isherwood, and Dylan Thomas.\nIn 1945, Stravinsky received American citizenship and subsequently signed a contract with British publishing house Boosey &amp; Hawkes, who agreed to publish all his future works. Additionally, he revised many of his older works and had Boosey &amp; Hawkes publish the new editions to re-copyright his older works. Around the 1948 premiere of another Balanchine collaboration, the ballet \"Orpheus\", the composer met the young conductor Robert Craft in New York; Craft had asked Stravinsky to explain the revision of the \"Symphonies of Wind Instruments\" for an upcoming concert. The two quickly became friends and Stravinsky invited Craft to Los Angeles; the young conductor soon became Stravinsky's assistant, collaborator, and amanuensis until the composer's death.\nTurn towards serialism.\nAs Stravinsky became more familiar with English, he developed the idea to write an English-language opera based on a series of paintings by 18th-century artist William Hogarth titled \"The Rake's Progress\". The composer joined Auden to write the libretto in November 1947; American writer Chester Kallman was later brought in to assist Auden. Stravinsky finished the opera of the same name in 1951, and despite its widespread performances and success, the composer was dismayed to find that his newer music did not captivate young composers. Craft had introduced Stravinsky to the serial music of the Second Viennese School shortly after \"The Rake's Progress\" premiered, and the opera's composer began studying and listening to the music of Anton Webern and Arnold Schoenberg.\nDuring the 1950s, Stravinsky continued touring extensively across the world, occasionally returning to Los Angeles to compose. In 1953, he agreed to compose a new opera with a libretto by Dylan Thomas, but development on the project came to a sudden end following Thomas's death in November of that year. Stravinsky completed \"In Memoriam Dylan Thomas\", his first work fully based on the serial twelve-tone technique, the following year. The 1956 cantata ' premiered at the International Festival of Contemporary Music in Venice, inspiring to commission the musical setting in 1957. With the Balanchine ballet \"Agon\", Stravinsky fused neoclassical themes with the twelve-tone technique, and ' showed his full shift towards use of tone rows. In 1959, Craft interviewed Stravinsky for an article titled \"Answers to 35 Questions\", in which the composer sought to correct myths surrounding him and discuss his relationships with other artists. The article was later expanded into a book, and over the next four years, three more interview-style books were published.\nContinued international tours brought Stravinsky to Washington, D.C. in January 1962, where he attended a dinner at the White House with then-President John F. Kennedy in honor of the composer's 80th birthday. Although it was largely an anti-Soviet political stunt, Stravinsky remembered the event fondly, composing the \"Elegy for J.F.K.\" after the president's assassination a year later. In September 1962, he returned to Russia for the first time since 1914, accepting an invitation from the Union of Soviet Composers to conduct six performances in Moscow and Leningrad. After the success of \"The Firebird\" and \"The Rite of Spring\" in the 1910s, Stravinsky's music was respected and frequently performed in the Soviet Union, influencing young Soviet composers at the time like Dmitri Shostakovich. However, after Stalin began consolidating power in the early 1930s, Stravinsky's music nearly vanished and was formally banned in 1948. A new interest in his works was born during the Khrushchev Thaw, partly due to the composer's 1962 visit. During his three-week visit he met with Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev and several leading Soviet composers, including Shostakovich and Aram Khachaturian. Stravinsky did not return to Los Angeles until December 1962 after eight months of almost continual traveling.\nFinal works and death.\nStravinsky revisited biblical themes for many of his later works, notably in the 1961 chamber cantata \"A Sermon, a Narrative and a Prayer\", the 1962 musical television production \"The Flood\", the 1963 Hebrew cantata \"Abraham and Isaac\", and the 1966 \"Requiem Canticles\", the last of which was his final major composition. Between tours, the composer worked relentlessly to devise new tone rows, even working on toilet paper from airplane lavatories. The intense touring schedule began taking a toll on the elderly composer; January 1967 marked his last recording session, and his final concert came the following May. An obviously very frail Stravinsky made his final public conducting appearance on 17 May 1967 at Massey Hall in Toronto, when he led the Toronto Symphony Orchestra in a performance of his Pulcinella Suite.\nAfter spending the autumn of 1967 in the hospital due to bleeding stomach ulcers and thrombosis, Stravinsky returned to domestic touring in 1968 (only appearing as an audience member) but stopped composing due to his gradual decline in physical health.\nIn his final years, the Stravinskys and Craft moved to New York to be closer to medical care, and the composer's travel was limited to visiting family in Europe. Soon after being discharged from Lenox Hill Hospital after contracting pulmonary edema, Stravinsky moved with his wife to a new apartment on Fifth Avenue. The composer died there on 6 April 1971 at the age of 88. A funeral service was held three days later at the Frank E. Campbell Funeral Chapel. After a service at Santi Giovanni e Paolo with a performance of the \"Requiem Canticles\" conducted by Craft, Stravinsky was buried on the cemetery island of San Michele in Venice, several meters from the tomb of Sergei Diaghilev.\nMusic.\nMuch of Stravinsky's music is characterized by short, sharp articulations with minimal rubato or vibrato. His student works were primarily assignments from his teacher Rimsky-Korsakov and were mainly influenced by Russian composers. His first three ballets, \"The Firebird\", \"Petrushka\", and \"The Rite of Spring\", marked the beginning of his international fame and a departure from 19th-century styles. Stravinsky's music is often divided into three periods of composition: his Russian period (1913\u20131920), where he was greatly influenced by Russian artists and folklore; his neoclassical period (1920\u20131951), where he turned towards techniques and themes from the classical period; and his serial period (1954\u20131968), where he used highly structured composition techniques pioneered by composers of the Second Viennese School.\nStudent works, 1898\u20131907.\nStravinsky's time before meeting Diaghilev was spent learning from Rimsky-Korsakov and his collaborators. Only three works survive from before Stravinsky met Rimsky-Korsakov in August 1902: \"Tarantella\" (1898), Scherzo in G minor (1902), and \"The Storm Cloud\", the first two being works for piano and the last for voice and piano. Stravinsky's first assignment from Rimsky-Korsakov was the four-movement Piano Sonata in F-sharp minor, which was also his first work to be performed in public. Rimsky-Korsakov often gave Stravinsky the task of orchestrating various works to allow him to analyze the works' form and structure. Many of Stravinsky's early works showed influence from French composers as well, notably in the minimal use of large doublings and different combinations of tone colors. A number of Stravinsky's student compositions were performed at Rimsky-Korsakov's gatherings at his home; these include a set of bagatelles, a \"chanson comique\", and a cantata, showing the use of classical musical techniques that would later define Stravinsky's neoclassical period. The musicologist Stephen Walsh described this time in Stravinsky's musical career as \"aesthetically cramped\" due to the \"cynical conservatism\" of Rimsky-Korsakov and his music. Rimsky-Korsakov thought the Symphony in E-flat (1907) was swayed too much by Glazunov's style, and disliked the modernist influence on \"Faun and Shepherdess\" (1907); however, critics found the works to not stand out from his teacher's music.\nFirst three ballets, 1910\u20131913.\nRussian composers often used large orchestration to feature many different timbres, and Stravinsky harnessed this idea in his first three ballets, often surprising the musicians and performers due to the orchestra's great force at certain moments. \"The Firebird\" used a harmonic structure that Stravinsky called \"leit-harmony\", a portmanteau of leitmotif and harmony used by Rimsky-Korsakov in his opera \"The Golden Cockerel\". The \"leit-harmony\" was used to juxtapose the protagonist, the Firebird, and the antagonist, Koschei the Deathless: the former was associated with whole-tone phrases and the latter with octatonic harmony. Stravinsky later wrote how he composed \"The Firebird\" in a state of \"revolt against Rimsky\", and that he \"tried to surpass him with \"ponticello\", \"col legno\", \"flautando\", \"glissando\", and fluttertongue effects\".\nStravinsky defined his musical character in his second ballet \"Petrushka\". The Russian influence can be seen in the use of a number of Russian folk tunes in addition to two waltzes by Viennese composer Joseph Lanner and a French music hall tune. Stravinsky also used a folk tune from Rimsky-Korsakov's opera \"The Snow Maiden\", showing the former's continued reverence for his teacher. \"Petrushka\" also contained one of the first prominent uses of bitonality in modern music, through use of the recurring \"Petrushka chord\".\nStravinsky's third ballet, \"The Rite of Spring\", caused a near-riot at the premiere due to its avant-garde nature. He had begun to experiment with polytonality in \"The Firebird\" and \"Petrushka\", but for \"The Rite of Spring\", he \"pushed [it] to its logical conclusion,\" as Eric Walter White described it. In addition, the complex meter in the music consists of phrases combining conflicting time signatures and odd accents, such as the \"jagged slashes\" in the \"Sacrificial Dance\". Both polytonality and unusual rhythms can be heard in the chords that open the second episode, \"Augurs of Spring\", consisting of an E-flat dominant 7 superimposed on an F-flat major triad written in an uneven rhythm, Stravinsky shifting the accents seemingly at random to create asymmetry. \"The Rite of Spring\" is one of the most famous and influential works of the 20th century; the musicologist Donald Jay Grout described it as having \"the effect of an explosion that so scattered the elements of musical language that they could never again be put together as before.\"\nRussian period, 1913\u20131920.\nThe musicologist Jeremy Noble said that Stravinsky's \"intensive researches into Russian folk material\" took place during his time in Switzerland from 1914 to 1920. B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k considered Stravinsky's Russian period to have begun in 1913 with \"The Rite of Spring\" due to its use of Russian folk songs, themes, and techniques. The use of duple or triple meters was especially prevalent in Stravinsky's Russian period music; while the pulse may have remained constant, the time signature would often change to constantly shift the accents.\nWhile Stravinsky did not use as many folk melodies as he had in his first three ballets, he often used folk poetry. The ballet-cantata ' was based on texts from a collection of Russian folk poetry by Pyotr Kireevsky, and his opera-ballet \"Renard\" was based on a folktale collected by Alexander Afanasyev. Many of Stravinsky's Russian period works featured animal characters and themes, likely due to inspiration from nursery rhymes he read with his children. Stravinsky also used unique theatrical styles. ' blended the staging of ballets with the small instrumentation of early cantatas, a unique production described on the score as \"Russian Choreographic Scenes\". In \"Renard\", the voices were placed in the orchestra, as they were meant to accompany the action on stage. \"L'Histoire du soldat\" was composed in 1918 with the Swiss novelist Charles F. Ramuz as a small musical theatre production for dancers, a narrator, and a septet. It mixed the Russian folktales in the narrative with common musical structures of the time, like the tango, waltz, rag, and chorale. Even as his style changed in later years, Stravinsky maintained a musical connection to his Russian roots.\nNeoclassical period, 1920\u20131951.\nThe ballet \"Pulcinella\" was commissioned by Diaghilev in 1919 after he proposed the idea of a ballet based on music by 18th-century Italian composers like Giovanni Battista Pergolesi; by imposing a work based on the harmonic and rhythmic systems of late-Baroque era composers, Stravinsky marked the start of his turn towards 18th-century music. Although the musicologist Jeremy Noble considered Stravinsky's neoclassical period to have begun in 1920 with his \"Symphonies of Wind Instruments\", Bart\u00f3k argued that the period \"really starts with his Octet for Wind Instruments, followed by his Concerto for Piano\". During this period, Stravinsky used techniques and themes from the classical period of music.\nGreek mythology was a common theme in Stravinsky's neoclassical works. His first Greek mythology-based work was the ballet (1927), choosing the leader of the Muses and the god of art Apollo as the subjects. Stravinsky would use themes from Greek mythology in future works like \"Oedipus rex\" (1927), \"Persephone\" (1935), and \"Orpheus\" (1947). Richard Taruskin wrote that \"Oedipus rex\" was \"the product of Stravinsky's neo-classical manner at its most extreme,\" and that musical techniques \"thought outdated\" were juxtaposed against contemporary ideas. In addition, Stravinsky turned towards older musical structures and modernized them. His Octet (1923) uses the sonata form, modernizing it by disregarding the standard ordering of themes and traditional tonal relationships for different sections. Baroque counterpoint was used throughout the choral \"Symphony of Psalms\" (1930). In the jazz-influenced \"Ebony Concerto\" (1945), Stravinsky fused big band orchestration with Baroque forms and harmonies.\nStravinsky's neoclassical period ended in 1951 with the opera \"The Rake's Progress\". Taruskin described the opera as \"the hub and essence of 'neo-classicism'\". He pointed out how the opera contains numerous references to Greek mythology and other operas like Mozart's \"Don Giovanni\" and Bizet's \"Carmen\", but still \"embod[ies] the distinctive structure of a fairy tale\". Stravinsky was inspired by the operas of Mozart in composing the music, particularly , but other scholars also point out influence from Handel, Gluck, Beethoven, Schubert, Weber, Rossini, Donizetti, and Verdi. \"The Rake's Progress\" has become an important work in opera repertoire, being \"[more performed] than any other opera written after the death of Puccini\", according to Taruskin.\nSerial period, 1954\u20131968.\nIn the 1950s, Stravinsky began using serial compositional techniques, such as the twelve-tone technique originally devised by Arnold Schoenberg. Noble wrote that this time was \"the most profound change in Stravinsky's musical vocabulary\", partly due to Stravinsky's newfound interest in the music of the Second Viennese School after meeting Robert Craft. The composer's treatment of the twelve-tone technique was unique: whereas Schoenberg's technique was very strict, disallowing repetitions of a tone row until it was complete, Stravinsky repeated notes freely, even separating the row into cells and reordering the notes. In addition, his serial period's orchestration style became dark and bass-heavy, with winds and piano frequently using their lowest registers.\nStravinsky first experimented with non-twelve-tone serial techniques in small-scale works such as the Cantata (1952), the Septet (1953) and \"Three Songs from Shakespeare\" (1953). The first of his compositions fully based on such techniques was \"In Memoriam Dylan Thomas\" (1954). \"Agon\" (1954\u20131957) was the first of his works to include a twelve-tone series, whereas the second movement from ' (1956) was the first piece to contain a movement entirely based on a tone row. \"Agon\"'s unique tonal structure was significant to Stravinsky's serial music; it begins diatonic, moves towards full 12-tone serialism in the middle, and returns to diatonicism in the end. Stravinsky returned to sacred themes in works such as \",\" ' (1958), \"A Sermon, a Narrative and a Prayer\" (1961), and \"The Flood\" (1962). Stravinsky used a number of concepts from earlier works in his serial pieces; for example, the voice of God being two bass voices in homophony seen in \"The Flood\" was previously used in \"\". Stravinsky's final large-scale work, the \"Requiem Canticles\" (1966), made use of a complex four-part array of tone rows throughout, showing the evolution of Stravinsky's serialist music. Noble described the \"Requiem Canticles\" as \"a distillation both of the liturgical text and of his own musical means of setting it, evolved and refined through a career of more than 60 years\".\nThe influence of other composers on Stravinsky can be seen throughout this period. He was heavily influenced by Schoenberg, not only in his use of the twelve-tone technique, but also in the distinctly \"Schoenbergian\" instrumentation of the Septet and the similarities between Schoenberg's \"Klangfarbenmelodie\" and Stravinsky's \".\" Stravinsky also used a number of themes found in works by Benjamin Britten, later commenting about the \"many titles and subjects [I have shared] with Mr. Britten already\". In addition, he was very familiar with the works of Anton Webern, being one of the figures who inspired Stravinsky to consider serialism a possible form of composition.\nArtistic influences.\nStravinsky worked with some of the most famous artists of his time, many of whom he met after achieving international success with \"The Firebird\". Diaghilev was one of the composer's most prominent artistic influences, having introduced him to composing for the stage and bringing him international fame with his first three ballets. Through the Ballets Russes and Diaghilev, Stravinsky worked with figures like Vaslav Nijinsky, L\u00e9onide Massine, Alexandre Benois, Michel Fokine, and L\u00e9on Bakst.\nThe composer's interest in art propelled him to develop a strong relationship with Picasso, whom he met in 1917. In the years following, the two engaged in an artistic dialogue in which they exchanged small-scale works of art to each other as a sign of intimacy, which included the famous portrait of Stravinsky by Picasso, and a short sketch of clarinet music by Stravinsky. This exchange was essential to establish how the artists would approach their collaborative space in \"Ragtime\" and \"Pulcinella\".\nStravinsky displayed a taste in literature that was wide and reflected his constant desire for new discoveries. The texts and literary sources for his work began with interest in Russian folklore. After moving to Switzerland in 1914, Stravinsky began gathering folk stories from numerous collections, which were later used in works like ', \"Renard\", ', and various songs. Many of Stravinsky's works, including \"The Firebird\", \"Renard\", and \"\" were inspired by Alexander Afanasyev's famous collection \"Russian Folk Tales\". Collections of folk music influenced Stravinsky's music; numerous melodies from \"The Rite of Spring\" were found in an anthology of Lithuanian folk songs.\nAn interest in the Latin liturgy began shortly after Stravinsky rejoined the church in 1926, beginning with the composition of his first religious work in 1926 \"\", written in Old Church Slavonic. He later used three psalms from the Latin Vulgate in his \"Symphony of Psalms\" for orchestra and mixed choir. Many works in the composer's neoclassical and serial periods used (or were based on) liturgical texts.\nStravinsky worked with many authors throughout his career. He first worked with the Swiss novelist Charles F. Ramuz on ' in 1918, with whom he formed the idea and wrote the text. In 1933, Ida Rubinstein commissioned Stravinsky to set music to a poem by Andr\u00e9 Gide, later becoming the melodrama '. The Stravinsky-Gide collaboration was apparently tense: Gide disliked how the music did not follow the prosody of his poem and did not attend rehearsals, and Stravinsky ignored many of Gide's ideas. Gide later left the project and did not attend the premiere run. The story of \"The Rake's Progress\" was first conceived by Stravinsky and W. H. Auden, the latter of whom wrote the libretto with Chester Kallman. Stravinsky befriended many other authors as well, including T. S. Eliot, Aldous Huxley, Christopher Isherwood, and Dylan Thomas, the last of whom Stravinsky began working with on an opera in 1953 but stopped due to Thomas's death.\nLegacy.\nStravinsky is widely regarded as one of the greatest composers of the 20th century. In 1998, \"Time\" magazine listed him as one of the 100 most influential people of the century. Stravinsky was not only recognized for his composing; he also achieved fame as a pianist and as a conductor. Philip Glass wrote in \"Time\", \"He conducted with an energy and vividness that completely conveyed his every musical intention. Here was Stravinsky, a musical revolutionary whose own evolution never stopped. There is not a composer who lived during his time or is alive today who was not touched, and sometimes transformed, by his work.\" Stravinsky was also renowned for his precise orchestration: the critic Alexis Roland-Manuel wrote that Stravinsky and the French composer Maurice Ravel were the \"[two men] in the world who best knows the weight of a trombone-note, the harmonics of a 'cello or a \"pp\" tam-tam in the relationships of one orchestral group to another.\"\nStravinsky was noted for his distinctive use of rhythm, especially in \"The\" \"Rite of Spring\". The rhythm in \"The Rite\" stretched across bars and lacked distinct beats, which opened the door for future composers to make rhythm more fluid within meters. However, many saw his subsequent neoclassical period as a return to the past while other composers tried advancing modern music. His subsequent turn towards serialism further alienated him from audiences, and academics saw this stylistic shift as not innovative enough, since they believed the death of Schoenberg also marked the end of twelve-tone music. Stephen Walsh related the changing nature of Stravinsky's music to the composer's nature: as an exile from his native Russia, Stravinsky adapted to his environment and absorbed the music of those around him. Martha Hyde stated that more recent analysis \"judg[ed] Stravinsky's neoclassical style as the harbinger of musical postmodernism\". After his death, Stravinsky's importance in modernist music became evident: though many modern styles quickly fell out of fashion (like twelve-tone music), the music of Stravinsky stood out as a body of unique ingenuity, according to Walsh.\nStravinsky influenced many composers and musicians. His music continues to offer inspiration and a unique method to young composers. The rhythmic innovations in \"The Rite of Spring\" brought rhythm to the forefront of modern music rather than tonality, setting a new standard in the modernist movement that future composers like Var\u00e8se and Ligeti were inspired to innovate upon. Stravinsky's rhythm and vitality greatly influenced Aaron Copland and Pierre Boulez, and the combination of folklore and modernism found in many of Stravinsky's works influenced B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k as well. Stravinsky's less popular works were also widely influential: the disconnected form of the \"Symphonies of Wind Instruments\" can be seen similarly in later works by avant-garde masters like Messiaen, Tippett, Andriessen, and Xenakis. Stravinsky also influenced composers like Elliott Carter, Harrison Birtwistle, and John Tavener. Aside from Craft, his students include Earnest Andersson, Armando Jos\u00e9 Fernandes, Mordecai Seter, Robert Strassburg, and Warren Zevon.\nRecordings.\nStravinsky's need for money during the World Wars led him to sign many contracts with record companies to conduct his music. His early exposure to player piano technology guided his view that records were far inferior to live performance but acted as historical documentation of how his works should be performed. As a result, Stravinsky left a massive archive of recordings of his own music, seldom recording music by other composers. Although most of his recordings were made with studio musicians, he also worked with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, the Cleveland Orchestra, the CBC Symphony Orchestra, the New York Philharmonic, the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, and the Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra. Stravinsky received five Grammy Awards and a total of eleven nominations for his recordings, with three of his albums being inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame. He was posthumously awarded the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 1987.\nDuring his lifetime, Stravinsky appeared on several telecasts and documentaries. The first, \"A Conversation with Igor Stravinsky\", was released in 1957 by NBC and produced by Robert Graff, who later commissioned and produced \"The Flood\". The interview-like format later influenced the various volumes Craft wrote with Stravinsky. The 1965 National Film Board of Canada documentary \"Stravinsky\", directed by Roman Kroitor and Wolf Koenig, followed Stravinsky conducting the CBC Symphony Orchestra in a recording of the \"Symphony of Psalms\", with anecdotal interviews interspersed throughout. The 1966 CBS documentary \"Portrait of Stravinsky\" took the composer back to the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre des Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es (where \"The Rite of Spring\" premiered) and to his old home in Clarens, Switzerland. Other documentaries captured the collaborative process between Balanchine and Stravinsky.\nWritings.\nStravinsky published a number of books throughout his career. In his 1936 autobiography, \"Chronicle of My Life\", which was written with the help of Walter Nouvel, Stravinsky included his well-known statement that \"music is, by its very nature, essentially powerless to express anything at all\". With Alexis Roland-Manuel and Pierre Souvtchinsky, he wrote his 1939\u201340 Harvard University Charles Eliot Norton Lectures, which were delivered in French and first collected under the title in 1942 and then translated in 1947 as \"Poetics of Music\". In 1959, several interviews between the composer and Craft were published as \"Conversations with Igor Stravinsky\". Five more volumes of a similar format were published over the following decade.\nBooks and articles are listed in Appendix E of Eric Walter White's \"Stravinsky: The Composer and His Works\", references in Alicja Jarz\u0119bska's \"Stravinsky: His Thoughts and Music\", and Stephen Walsh's profile of Stravinsky on \"Oxford Music Online\".\nReferences.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\nBooks.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nArticles and dissertations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "38173", "revid": "1756588", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=38173", "title": "Hot air balloon", "text": "Lighter-than-air aircraft\nA hot air balloon is a lighter-than-air aircraft consisting of a bag, called an envelope, which contains heated air. Suspended beneath is a gondola or wicker basket (in some long-distance or high-altitude balloons, a capsule), which carries passengers and a source of heat, in most cases an open flame caused by burning liquid propane. The heated air inside the envelope makes it buoyant, since it has a lower density than the colder air outside the envelope. As with all aircraft, hot air balloons cannot fly beyond the atmosphere. The envelope does not have to be sealed at the bottom, since the air inside the envelope is at about the same pressure as the surrounding air. In modern sport balloons the envelope is generally made from nylon fabric, and the inlet of the balloon (closest to the burner flame) is made from a fire-resistant material such as Nomex. Modern balloons have been made in many shapes, such as rocket ships and the shapes of various commercial products, though the traditional shape is used for most non-commercial and many commercial applications.\nThe hot air balloon is the first successful human-carrying flight technology. The first untethered manned hot air balloon flight in the world was performed in Paris, France, by Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Pil\u00e2tre de Rozier and Fran\u00e7ois Laurent d'Arlandes on November 21, 1783, in a balloon created by the Montgolfier brothers. Hot air balloons that can be propelled through the air rather than simply drifting with the wind are known as thermal airships.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nHistory.\nPremodern and unmanned balloons.\nA precursor of the hot air balloon was the sky lantern (). Zhuge Liang of the Shu Han kingdom, during the Three Kingdoms era (220\u2013280\u00a0CE), used these airborne lanterns for military signaling. The Mongolian army studied Kongming lanterns from China and used them in the Battle of Legnica during the Mongol invasion of Poland in the 13th century. This is the first time ballooning was known in the western world.\nIn the 18th century the Portuguese Jesuit priest Bartolomeu de Gusm\u00e3o in colonial Brazil envisioned an aerial apparatus named , which was the predecessor of the hot air balloon. The was intended to serve as an air vessel in order to facilitate communication and as a strategical device. In 1709 John V of Portugal decided to fund Bartolomeu de Gusm\u00e3o's project following a petition made by the Jesuit priest, and an unmanned demonstration was performed at Casa da \u00cdndia in the presence of John\u00a0V and the queen, Maria Anna of Austria, with the Italian cardinal Michelangelo Conti, two members of the Portuguese Royal Academy of History, one Portuguese diplomat and one chronicler serving as witnesses. This event would bring some European attention to this event and this project. A later article dated on October 20, 1786, by the London \"Daily Universal Register\" would state that the inventor was able to raise himself by the use of his prototype. Also in 1709, the Portuguese Jesuit wrote (\"Short Manifesto for those who are unaware that is possible to sail through the element air\"); he also left designs for a manned air vessel.\nIn the 1970s, balloonist Julian Nott hypothesized that the Nazca Lines geoglyphs' creation two millennia ago could have been guided by Nazca leaders in a balloon, possibly the earliest hot air balloon flights in human history. To support this theory, in 1975 he designed and piloted the Nazca Prehistoric Balloon, claiming to have used only methods and materials available to the Pre-Inca Peruvians 1,000 years ago.\nFirst manned flight.\nThe French brothers Joseph-Michel and Jacques-\u00c9tienne Montgolfier developed a hot-air balloon in Annonay, Ard\u00e8che, France, and demonstrated it publicly on September 19, 1783, making an unmanned flight lasting 10\u00a0minutes. After experimenting with unmanned balloons and flights with animals, the first balloon flight with humans aboard, a tethered flight, performed on or around October 15, 1783, by Jean-Francois Pilatre de Rozier, who made at least one tethered flight from the yard of the Reveillon workshop in the Faubourg Saint-Antoine. Later that same day, Pilatre de Rozier became the second human to ascend into the air, reaching an altitude of , the length of the tether. The first free flight with human passengers was made a few weeks later, on November 21, 1783. King Louis XVI had originally decreed that condemned criminals would be the first pilots, but de Rozier, along with Marquis Fran\u00e7ois d'Arlandes, petitioned successfully for the honor.\nThe first military use of a hot air balloon happened in 1794 during the battle of Fleurus, when the French used the balloon for observation.\nModern balloons.\nModern hot air balloons, with an onboard heat source, were developed by Ed Yost and Jim Winker, beginning during the 1950s; their work resulted in his a first successful flight on October 22, 1960. The first modern hot air balloon to be made in the United Kingdom (UK) was the Bristol Belle, built in 1967. Presently, hot air balloons are used primarily for recreation.\nRecords.\nAltitude.\nOn November 26, 2005 Vijaypat Singhania set the world altitude record for highest hot air balloon flight, reaching . He took off from downtown Mumbai, India, and landed south in Panchale. \nThe previous record of had been set by Per Lindstrand on June 6, 1988, in Plano, Texas.\nSpeed.\nOn January 15, 1991, Per Lindstrand (born in Sweden, but resident in the UK) and Richard Branson of the UK flew from Japan to Northern Canada in the \u201cVirgin Pacific Flyer\u201d. With a volume of 74,000 cubic meters (2.6\u00a0million cubic feet), the balloon envelope was the largest ever built for a hot air craft. Designed to fly in the trans-oceanic jet streams, the \"Pacific Flyer\" recorded the fastest ground speed for a manned balloon at . \nLength.\nThe longest duration record was set by Swiss psychiatrist Bertrand Piccard (Auguste Piccard's grandson) and Briton Brian Jones, flying in the Breitling Orbiter 3. It was the first nonstop trip around the world by balloon. The balloon left Ch\u00e2teau-d'Oex, Switzerland, on March 1, 1999, and landed at 1:02\u00a0a.m. on March 21 in the Egyptian desert south of Cairo. The two men exceeded distance, endurance, and time records, traveling 19 days, 21 hours, and 55 minutes. \nBriefest trip around the world.\nSteve Fossett, flying solo, exceeded the record for briefest time traveling around the world on 3 July 2002 on his sixth attempt, in 320 h 33 min. Fedor Konyukhov flew solo round the world on his first attempt in a hybrid hot air/helium balloon from 11 to 23 July 2016 for a round-the world time of 268 h 20 min.\nConstruction.\nA hot air balloon for manned flight uses a single-layered, fabric gas bag (lifting \"envelope\"), with an opening at the bottom called the mouth or throat. Attached to the envelope is a basket, or gondola, for carrying the passengers. Mounted above the basket and centered in the mouth is the \"burner\", which injects a flame into the envelope, heating the air within. The heater or burner is fueled by propane, a liquefied gas stored in pressure vessels, similar to high-pressure forklift cylinders.\nEnvelope.\nModern hot air balloons are usually made of materials such as ripstop nylon or dacron (a polyester).\nDuring the manufacturing process, the material is cut into panels and sewn together, along with structural load tapes that carry the weight of the gondola or basket. The individual sections, which extend from the throat to the crown (top) of the envelope, are known as gores or gore sections. Envelopes can have as few as 4 gores or as many as 24 or more.\nEnvelopes often have a crown ring at their very top. This is a hoop of smooth metal, usually aluminium, and approximately in diameter. Vertical load tapes from the envelope are attached to the crown ring.\nAt the bottom of the envelope the vertical load tapes are sewn into loops that are connected to cables (one cable per load tape). These cables, often referred to as flying wires, are connected to the basket by carabiners.\nSeams.\nThe most common technique for sewing panels together is called the \"French felled\", \"French fell\", or \"double lap\" seam. The two pieces of fabric are folded over on each other at their common edge, possibly with a load tape as well, and sewn together with two rows of parallel stitching. Other methods include a \"flat lap\" seam, in which the two pieces of fabric are held together simply with two rows of parallel stitching, and a \"zigzag\", where parallel zigzag stitching holds a double lap of fabric.\nCoatings.\nThe fabric (or at least part of it, the top 1/3, for example) may be coated with a sealer, such as silicone or polyurethane, to make it impermeable to air. It is often the degradation of this coating and the corresponding loss of impermeability that ends the effective life of an envelope, not weakening of the fabric itself. Heat, moisture, and mechanical wear-and-tear during set-up and pack-up are the primary causes of degradation. Once an envelope becomes too porous to fly, it may be retired and discarded or perhaps used as a \"rag bag\": cold-inflated and opened for children to run through. Products for recoating the fabric are becoming available commercially.\nSizes and capacity.\nA range of envelope sizes is available. The smallest, one-person, basket-less balloons (called \"Hoppers\" or \"Cloudhoppers\") have as little as of envelope volume; for a perfect sphere the radius would be around . At the other end of the scale, balloons used by commercial sightseeing operations may be able to carry well over two dozen people, with envelope volumes of up to . The most-used size is about , allowing to carry 3 to 5 people.\nVents.\nThe top of the balloon usually has a vent of some sort, enabling the pilot to release hot air to slow an ascent, start a descent, or increase the rate of descent, usually for landing. Some hot air balloons have \"turning vents\", which are side vents that, when opened, cause the balloon to rotate. Such vents are particularly useful for balloons with rectangular baskets, to facilitate aligning the wider side of the basket for landing.\nThe most common type of top vent is a disk-shaped flap of fabric called a \"parachute vent\", invented by Tracy Barnes. The fabric is connected around its edge to a set of \"vent lines\" that converge in the center. (The arrangement of fabric and lines roughly resembles a parachute\u2014thus the name.) These \"vent lines\" are themselves connected to a control line that runs to the basket. A parachute vent is opened by pulling on the control line. Once the control line is released, the pressure of the remaining hot air pushes the vent fabric back into place. A parachute vent can be opened briefly while in flight to initiate a rapid descent. (Slower descents are initiated by allowing the air in the balloon to cool naturally.) The vent is pulled open completely to collapse the balloon after landing.\nAn older, and presently less commonly used, style of top vent is called a \"Velcro-style\" vent. This too is a disk of fabric at the top of the balloon. However, rather than having a set of \"vent lines\" that can repeatedly open and close the vent, the vent is secured by \"hook and loop\" fasteners (such as Velcro) and is only opened at the end of the flight. Balloons equipped with a Velcro-style vent typically have a second \"maneuvering vent\" built into the side (as opposed to the top) of the balloon. Another common type of top design is the \"smart vent\", which, rather than lowering a fabric disc into the envelope as in the \"parachute\" type, gathers the fabric together in the center of the opening. This system can theoretically be used for in-flight maneuvering, but is more commonly used only as a rapid-deflation device for use after landing, of particular value in high winds. Other designs, such as the \"pop top\" and \"MultiVent\" systems, have also attempted to address the need for rapid deflation on landing, but the parachute top remains popular as an all-around maneuvering and deflation system.\nShape.\nBesides special shapes, possibly for marketing purposes, there are several variations on the traditional \"inverted tear drop\" shape. The simplest, often used by home builders, is a hemisphere on top of a truncated cone. More sophisticated designs attempt to minimize the circumferential stress on the fabric, with different degrees of success depending on whether they take fabric weight and varying air density into account. This shape may be referred to as \"natural\". Finally, some specialized balloons are designed to minimize aerodynamic drag (in the vertical direction) to improve flight performance in competitions.\nBasket.\nHot air balloon baskets are commonly made of woven wicker or rattan. These materials have proven to be sufficiently light, strong, and durable for balloon flight. Such baskets are usually rectangular or triangular in shape. They vary in size from just big enough for two people to large enough to carry thirty. Larger baskets often have internal partitions for structural bracing and to compartmentalize the passengers. Small holes may be woven into the side of the basket to act as foot holds for passengers climbing in or out.\nBaskets may also be made of aluminium, especially a collapsible aluminium frame with a fabric skin, to reduce weight or increase portability. These may be used by pilots without a ground crew or who are attempting to set altitude, duration, or distance records. Other specialty baskets include the fully enclosed gondolas used for around-the-world attempts and baskets that consist of little more than a seat for the pilot and perhaps one passenger.\nBurner.\nThe burner unit gasifies liquid propane, mixes it with air, ignites the mixture, and directs the flame and exhaust into the mouth of the envelope. Burners vary in power output; each will generally produce 2 to 3\u00a0MW of heat (7 to 10\u00a0million BTUs per hour), with double, triple, or quadruple burner configurations installed where more power is needed. The pilot actuates a burner by opening a propane valve, known as a blast valve. The valve may be spring-loaded, so that it closes automatically, or it may stay open until closed by the pilot. The burner has a pilot light to ignite the propane and air mixture. The pilot light may be lit by the pilot with an external device, such as a flint striker or a lighter, or with a built-in piezoelectric spark.\nWhere more than one burner is present, the pilot can use one or more at a time, depending on the desired heat output. Each burner has a metal coil of propane tubing the flame shoots through to preheat the incoming liquid propane. The burner unit may be suspended from the mouth of the envelope or supported rigidly over the basket. The burner unit may be mounted on a gimbal to enable the pilot to aim the flame and avoid overheating the envelope fabric. A burner may have a secondary propane valve that releases propane more slowly and thereby generates a different sound. This is called a \"whisper burner\" and is used for flight over livestock to lessen the chance of spooking them. It also generates a more yellow flame and is used for night glows because it lights up the inside of the envelope better than the primary valve.\nFuel tanks.\nPropane fuel tanks are usually cylindrical pressure vessels made from aluminium, stainless steel, or titanium with a valve at one end to feed the burner and to refuel. They may have a fuel gauge and a pressure gauge. Common tank sizes are . They may be intended for upright or horizontal use and may be mounted inside or outside the basket.\nThe pressure necessary to force the fuel through the line to the burner may be supplied by the vapor pressure of the propane itself, if warm enough, or by the introduction of an inert gas such as nitrogen. Tanks may be preheated with electrical heat tapes to produce sufficient vapor pressure for cold-weather flying. Warmed tanks are usually also wrapped in an insulating blanket to preserve heat during the setup and flight.\nInstrumentation.\nA balloon may be outfitted with a variety of instruments to aid the pilot. These commonly include an altimeter, a rate-of-climb (vertical-speed) indicator known as a variometer, envelope (air) temperature, and ambient (air) temperature. A GPS receiver can be useful to indicate ground speed (traditional aircraft air-speed indicators would be useless) and direction.\nCombined mass.\nThe combined mass of an average system can be calculated as follows:\n * Using a density of for dry air heated to .\nTheory of operation.\nGenerating lift.\nIncreasing the air temperature inside the envelope makes it less dense than the surrounding (ambient) air. The balloon floats because of the buoyant force exerted on it. This force is the same force that acts on objects when they are in water and is described by Archimedes' principle. The amount of lift (or buoyancy) provided by a hot air balloon depends primarily upon the difference between the temperature of the air inside the envelope and the temperature of the air outside the envelope. For most envelopes made of nylon fabric, the maximal internal temperature is limited to approximately 120\u00a0\u00b0C (250\u00a0\u00b0F).\nThe melting point of nylon is significantly greater than this maximal operating temperature\u2014about 230\u00a0\u00b0C (450\u00a0\u00b0F)\u2014but higher temperatures cause the strength of the nylon fabric to degrade more quickly over time. With a maximal operating temperature of 120\u00a0\u00b0C (250\u00a0\u00b0F), balloon envelopes can generally be flown for between 400 and 500 hours before the fabric needs to be replaced. Many balloon pilots operate their envelopes at temperatures significantly less than the maximum to extend envelope-fabric life.\nThe lift generated by of dry air heated to various temperatures may be calculated as follows:\nThe density of air at is about . The total lift for a balloon of heated to would be . This is just enough to generate neutral buoyancy for the total system mass (not including the heated air trapped in the envelope, of course) stated in the previous section. Liftoff would require a slightly greater temperature, depending on the desired rate of climb. In reality, the air contained in the envelope is not all at the same temperature, as the accompanying thermal image shows, and so these calculations are based on averages.\nFor typical atmospheric conditions (), a hot air balloon heated to requires about 3.91\u00a0m3 of envelope volume to lift 1\u00a0kilogram (equivalently, 62.5\u00a0cu\u00a0ft/lb). The precise amount of lift provided depends not only upon the internal temperature mentioned above, but the external temperature, altitude above sea level, and humidity of the air surrounding. On a warm day, a balloon cannot lift as much as on a cool day, because the temperature required for launch will exceed the maximum sustainable for nylon envelope fabric. Also, in the lower atmosphere, the lift provided by a hot air balloon decreases about 3% per 1,000\u00a0m (1% per 1,000\u00a0ft) of altitude gained.\nTypes of Hot Air Balloons.\nThere are several different types of hot air balloons, all with different means of taking and sustaining flight.\nMontgolfier.\nStandard hot air balloons are known as Montgolfier balloons and rely solely on the buoyancy of hot air provided by the burner and contained by the envelope. This style of balloon was developed by the Montgolfier brothers and had its first public demonstration on 4 June 1783 with an unmanned flight lasting 10\u00a0minutes, followed later that year with manned flights.\nGas.\nInstead of using regular air it is also possible to use lighter than air gasses such as Helium or Hydrogen to lift the balloon, though this means it is technically not a hot air balloon, though they did influence the design of hybrid balloons.\nHybrid.\nThe 1785 Rozi\u00e8re balloon, is the main type of hybrid balloon, named after its creator, Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Pil\u00e2tre de Rozier. It has a separate cell for a lighter-than-air gas (typically helium), as well as a cone below for hot air (as is used in a hot air balloon) to heat the helium at night. Hydrogen gas was used in the very early stages of development but was quickly abandoned due to the danger of introducing an open flame near the gas, for example when Rozier attempted to cross the English Channel with his prototype, the fire used to heat the air ignited the Hydrogen and killed both him and his copilot thirty minutes after takeoff. As such, all modern hybrid balloons now use helium as a lifting gas. These balloons are commonly used for high performance records for hot air balloons.\nSolar.\nSolar balloons are hot air balloons that use just solar energy captured by an envelope. These envelopes are more specialized than for other hot air balloons, trying to maximize the amount of solar energy they collect. This can be accomplished by rotating the envelope during flight or by having the envelope colored black or another dark color. They were pioneered in the 1970s in Europe by Tracy Barnes, Dominic Michaelis, and in the US by Frederick Espoo and Paul Woessher.\nThermal Airship.\nA Thermal airship, or blimp, became a reality in the 1960s. Thermal airships were the first steerable air buoyant vehicles. They utilized tail fins and a rudder and contained strictly hot air rather than a mix with hydrogen or helium.\nObservation Balloon.\nObservation balloons were deployed as early as the American Civil War and used as reconnaissance towers. The first military funded balloon in America was designed by Thaddeus Lowe on August 2, 1861, for the Union. His design utilized gas from municipal lines to inflate the balloon as he did not have access to a portable generator. Observation balloons during this time were all made using multicolored-silk, wicker baskets, and were vertically oriented and tear shaped. Hydrogen, or illumination gas became the most used inflation fuel by the 20th Century, as it was lighter than air. Observation balloon usage skyrocketed in Britain by the Royal Engineers at the end of the 19th Century, deploying to Sudan in 1885 and to South Africa during the Second Boer War from 1899 to 1902.\nSteering.\nDue to the overall design of hot air balloons, controlled and precise steering of hot air balloons is not possible; it is possible for pilots to try to achieve basic directional control by changing altitude and catching different wind streams. Wind in the northern hemisphere tends to turn east due to coriolis effect as the altitude increases.\nLanding.\nThe most effective way of landing a hot air balloon is to reduce the energy in the envelope, either by turning down the flame in Montgolfier and Hybrid balloons, or more directly by opening a flap in the envelope that will release the air/gas inside.\nSafety equipment.\nTo help ensure the safety of pilot and passengers, a hot air balloon may carry several pieces of safety equipment.\nBasket.\nTo relight the burner if the pilot light goes out and the optional piezo ignition fails, the pilot should have ready access to a means of backup ignition, such as a flint spark lighter. Many systems, especially those that carry passengers, have completely duplicate fuel and burner systems: two fuel tanks, connected to two separate hoses, which feed two distinct burners. This enables a safe landing in the case of a blockage somewhere in one system or if a system must be disabled because of a fuel leak.\nA fire extinguisher suitable for extinguishing propane fires is useful. Most balloons carry a 1 or 2\u00a0kg AB:E type fire extinguisher.\nA handling or drop line is mandatory safety equipment in many countries. This is a rope or webbing of 20\u201330\u00a0meters in length attached to the balloon basket with a quick-release connection at one end. In very calm winds the balloon pilot can throw the handling line from the balloon so that the ground crew can guide the balloon safely away from obstructions on the ground.\nFor commercial passenger balloons, a pilot restraint harness is mandatory in some countries. This consists of a hip belt and a webbing line that together allow for some movement while preventing the pilot from being ejected from the basket during a hard landing.\nFurther safety equipment may include a first-aid kit, a fire blanket and a strong rescue knife.\nOccupants.\nAt a minimum, the pilot should wear leather or flame-retardant fiber (such as nomex) gloves, so that they may shut off a gas valve in the case of a leak, even if there is a flame present; quick action in this regard can turn a potential catastrophe into a mere inconvenience. The pilot should additionally wear flame-resistant clothing covering their arms and legs; either natural fiber, such as cotton, linen, hemp, or wool, or engineered flame-retardant fiber, such as nomex, is acceptable in this capacity. Most engineered fibers (with the exception of rayon, which is also safe to wear) are thermoplastic; many are also hydrocarbons. This makes such fabrics very much unsuitable to wear near high temperatures, since non-flame-retardant thermoplastics will melt onto the wearer, and most hydrocarbons, whether fibrous or not, are suitable to use as fuels. Natural fiber will singe rather than melt or burn readily, and flame-retardant fiber generally has a very high melting point and is intrinsically non-flammable. Many pilots also advise their passengers to wear similar protective clothing that covers their arms and legs, as well as strong shoes or boots that offer good ankle support. Finally, some balloon systems, especially those that hang the burner from the envelope instead of supporting it rigidly from the basket, require the use of helmets by the pilot and passengers.\nGround crew.\nThe ground crew should wear gloves whenever there is a possibility of handling ropes or lines. The mass and exposed surface to air movement of a medium-sized balloon is sufficient to cause rope friction burns to the hands of anyone trying to stop or prevent movement. The ground crew should also wear sturdy shoes and at least long pants in case of the need to access a landing or landed balloon in rough or overgrown terrain.\nMaintenance and repair.\nAs with aircraft, hot air balloons require regular maintenance to remain airworthy. As aircraft made of fabric and that lack direct horizontal control, hot air balloons may occasionally require repairs to rips or snags. While some operations, such as cleaning and drying, may be performed by the owner or pilot, other operations, such as sewing, must be performed by a qualified repair technician and recorded in the balloon's maintenance log book.\nMaintenance.\nTo ensure long life and safe operation, the envelope should be kept clean and dry. This prevents mold and mildew from forming on the fabric and abrasion from occurring during packing, transport, and unpacking due to contact with foreign particles. In the event of a landing in a wet (because of precipitation or early morning or late evening dew) or muddy location (farmer's field), the envelope should be cleaned and laid out or hung to dry.\nThe burner and fuel system must also be kept clean to ensure safe operation on demand. Damaged fuel hoses need to be replaced. Stuck or leaky valves must be repaired or replaced. The wicker basket may require occasional refinishing or repair. The skids on its bottom may require occasional replacement.\nBalloons in most parts of the world are maintained in accordance with a fixed manufacturer's maintenance schedule that includes regular (100 flight hours or 12 month) inspections, in addition to maintenance work to correct any damage. In Australia, balloons used for carrying commercial passengers must be inspected and maintained by approved workshops.\nRepair.\nIn the case of a snag, burn, or rip in the envelope fabric, a patch may be applied or the affected panel completely replaced. Patches may be held in place with glue, tape, stitching, or a combination of these techniques. Replacing an entire panel requires the stitching around the old panel to be removed, and a new panel to be sewn in with the appropriate technique, thread, and stitch pattern.\nLicensing.\nDepending on the size of the balloon, location, and intended use, hot air balloons and their pilots need to comply with a variety of regulations.\nBalloons.\nAs with other aircraft in the US, balloons must be registered (have an N-number), have an airworthiness certificate, and pass annual inspections. Balloons below a certain size (empty weight of less than 155\u00a0pounds or 70\u00a0kg including envelope, basket, burners and empty fuel tanks) can be used as an ultralight aircraft.\nPilots.\nIn Australia.\nIn Australia, private balloon pilots are managed by the Australian Ballooning Federation\nand typically become members of regional hot air ballooning clubs. Commercial operations carrying fare paying passengers or charging for promotional flights must operate under an Air Operators Certificate from the Australian Civil Aviation and Safety Authority (CASA) with a nominated Chief Pilot. Pilots must have different degrees of experience before they are allowed to progress to larger balloons. Hot air balloons must be registered aircraft with CASA and are subject to regular airworthiness checks by authorised personnel.\nIn the UK.\nIn the UK, the person in command must hold a valid Private Pilot's Licence issued by the Civil Aviation Authority specifically for ballooning; this is known as the PPL(B). There are two types of commercial balloon licences: CPL(B) Restricted and CPL(B) (Full). The CPL(B) Restricted is required if the pilot is undertaking work for a sponsor or being paid by an external agent to operate a balloon. The pilot can fly a sponsored balloon with everything paid for with a PPL unless asked to attend any event. Then a CPL(B) Restricted is required. The CPL(B) is required if the pilot is flying passengers for money. The balloon then needs a transport category C of A (certificate of air worthiness). If the pilot is only flying sponsor's guests and not charging money for flying other passengers, then the pilot is exempted from holding an AOC (air operator's certificate) though a copy of it is required. For passenger flying the balloon also requires a maintenance log.\nIn the United States.\nIn the United States, a pilot of a hot air balloon must have a pilot certificate from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), carrying the rating of \"Lighter-than-air free balloon\", and unless the pilot is also qualified to fly gas balloons, will also carry this limitation: \"Limited to hot-air balloons with airborne heater\". A pilot does not need a license to fly an ultralight aircraft, but training is highly advised, and some hot-air balloons meet the criteria.\nTo carry paying passengers for hire (and attend some balloon festivals), a pilot must have a commercial pilot certificate. Commercial hot air balloon pilots may also act as hot air balloon flight instructors. While most balloon pilots fly for the pure joy of floating through the air, many are able to make a living as a professional balloon pilot. Some professional pilots fly commercial passenger sightseeing flights, while others fly corporate advertising balloons.\nManufacturers.\nThe largest manufacturer of hot air balloons is Cameron Balloons of Bristol, England, which also owns Lindstrand Balloons of Oswestry, England. Cameron Balloons, Lindstrand Balloons and another English balloon manufacturing company Thunder and Colt (since acquired by Cameron) have been innovators and developers of special shaped balloons. These hot-air balloons use the same principle of lift as conventional inverted teardrop-shaped balloons, but often sections of the special balloon envelope shape do not contribute to the balloon's ability to stay aloft.\nThe second largest manufacturer of hot air balloons is Ultramagic company, based in Spain, which produces from 80 to 120 balloons per year. Ultramagic can produce very large balloons, such as the N-500 that accommodates as many as 27 persons in the basket, and has also produced many balloons with special shapes, as well as cold-air inflatables.\nOne of the three largest companies in the world is Kubicek Balloons. From its factory in Brno, Czechia the company ships its products worldwide. Produces from 100 to 115 balloons per year. Kubicek company also focus on special shape balloons, FAA/EASA type certified and are delivered with a Standard Airworthiness Certificate.\nIn the USA Aerostar International, Inc. of Sioux Falls, South Dakota was North America's largest balloon manufacturer and a close second in world manufacturing before ceasing to build balloons in January 2007. The oldest U.S. certified manufacturer is now Adams Balloons out of Albuquerque, New Mexico. Firefly Balloons, formerly The Balloon Works, is a manufacturer of hot air balloons in Statesville, North Carolina. Another manufacturer is Head Balloons, Inc. of Helen, Georgia.\nThe major manufacturers in Canada are Sundance Balloons and Fantasy Sky Promotions. Other manufacturers include Kavanagh Balloons of Australia, Schroeder Fire Balloons of Germany, Kubicek Balloons of the Czech Republic, and LLopis Balloons of France.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The situation arose from the conflict between the papacy and the French crown, culminating in the death of Pope Boniface VIII after his arrest and maltreatment by agents of Philip IV of France. Following the subsequent death of Pope Benedict XI, Philip pressured a deadlocked conclave to elect the Archbishop of Bordeaux as pope Clement V in 1305. Clement refused to move to Rome, and in 1309 he moved his court to the papal enclave at Avignon, where it remained for the next 67 years. This absence from Rome is sometimes referred to as the \"Babylonian captivity\" of the Papacy (cf. Italian , i.e. \"Avignonese captivity\").\nA total of seven popes reigned at Avignon, all French, and all under the influence of the French Crown. In 1376, Gregory XI abandoned Avignon and moved his court to Rome, arriving in January 1377. After Gregory's death in 1378, deteriorating relations between his successor Urban VI and a faction of cardinals gave rise to the Western Schism. This started a second line of Avignon popes, subsequently regarded as illegitimate. The last Avignon antipope, Benedict XIII, lost most of his support in 1398, including that of France. After five years besieged by the French, he fled to Perpignan in 1403. The schism ended in 1417 at the Council of Constance.\nAvignon popes.\nAmong the popes who resided in Avignon, subsequent Catholic historiography grants legitimacy to these:\nThe two Avignon-based antipopes were:\nBenedict XIII was succeeded by three antipopes, who had little or no public following, and were not resident at Avignon:\nThe period from 1378 to 1417, when there were rival claimants to the title of pope, is referred to as the \"Western Schism\" or \"the great controversy of the antipopes\" by some Catholic scholars and \"the second great schism\" by many secular and Protestant historians. Parties within the Catholic Church were divided in their allegiance among the various claimants to the office of pope. The Council of Constance finally resolved the controversy in 1417 when the election of Pope Martin V was accepted by all.\nAvignon and the small enclave to the east (\"Comtat Venaissin\") remained part of the Papal States until 1791 when, under pressure from French Revolutionaries, they were absorbed by the short-lived revolutionary Kingdom of France (1791\u201392), which, in turn, was abolished in favor of the French First Republic the following year.\nBackground.\nTemporal role of the Roman Church.\nThe papacy in the Late Middle Ages played a major temporal role in addition to its spiritual role. The conflict between the pope and the Holy Roman Emperor was fundamentally a dispute over which of them was the leader of Christendom in secular matters. In the early 14th century, the papacy was well past the prime of its secular rule\u00a0\u2013 its importance had peaked in the 12th and 13th centuries. The success of the early Crusades added greatly to the prestige of the Popes as secular leaders of Christendom, with monarchs like those of England, France, and even the Holy Roman Emperor merely acting as marshals for the popes and leading \"their\" armies. One exception was Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor, who was twice excommunicated by the Pope during a Crusade. Frederick II ignored this and was moderately successful in the Holy Land.\nKing Philip IV of France wanted to use the finances of the Church to pay for his war with the English. Pope Boniface VIII protested, leading to a feud.\nThis state of affairs culminated in the unbridled declaration of papal supremacy, \"Unam sanctam\", in November 1302. In that papal bull, Pope Boniface VIII decreed that \"it is necessary to salvation that every human creature be subject to the Roman pontiff.\" This was directed primarily to King Philip IV of France who responded by saying, \"Let thy foolishness know that in temporal things we are subject to no man.\"\nIn 1303, Pope Boniface VIII followed up with a bull that would excommunicate the king of France and put an interdict over all France. Before this was finalized, Italian allies of the king of France broke into the papal residence and beat Pope Boniface VIII. He died shortly thereafter. Nicholas Boccasini was elected as his successor and took the name Pope Benedict XI. He absolved King Philip IV and his subjects of their actions against Pope Boniface VIII, though the culprits who assaulted Boniface were excommunicated and ordered to appear before a pontifical tribunal. Benedict XI died within eight months of being elected to the papacy. After eleven months, Bertrand de Got, a Frenchman and a personal friend of King Philip IV, was elected as pope and took the name Pope Clement V.\nBeginning with Clement V, elected 1305, all popes during the Avignon papacy were French. However, this makes French influence seem greater than it was. Southern France (Occitania) at that time had a culture quite independent from northern France, where most of the advisers to the king of France were based. The Kingdom of Arles was not yet part of France, instead being formally a part of the Holy Roman Empire. The literature produced by the troubadours in Languedoc is unique and strongly distinct from that of royal circles in the north. Even in terms of religion, the south produced its own variety of Christianity, Catharism, which was ultimately declared heretical. The movement was fueled in no small part by the strong sense of independence in the south even though the region had been severely weakened during the Albigensian Crusade a hundred years before. By the time of the Avignon Papacy, the power of the French king in this region was uncontested, although still not legally binding.\nA stronger impact was made by the move of the Roman Curia from Rome to Poitiers in France in 1305, and then to Avignon in 1309. Following the impasse during the previous conclave, and to escape from the infighting of the powerful Roman families that had produced earlier Popes, such as the Colonna and Orsini families, the Catholic Church looked for a safer place and found it in Avignon, which was surrounded by the lands of the papal fief of Comtat Venaissin. Formally it was part of Arles, but in reality it was under the influence of the French king.\nDuring its time in Avignon, the papacy adopted many features of the Royal court: the life-style of its cardinals was more reminiscent of princes than clerics; more and more French cardinals, often relatives of the ruling pope, took key positions; and the proximity of French troops was a constant reminder of where secular power lay, with the memory of Pope Boniface VIII still fresh.\nCentralization of Church administration.\nThe temporal role of the Catholic Church increased the pressure upon the papal court to emulate the governmental practices and procedures of secular courts. The Catholic Church successfully reorganised and centralized its administration under Clement V and John XXII. The papacy now directly controlled the appointments of benefices, abandoning the customary election process that traditionally allotted this considerable income.\nMany other forms of payment brought riches to the Holy See and its cardinals: tithes, a ten-percent tax on church property; annates, the income of the first year after filling a position such as a bishopric; special taxes for crusades that never took place; and many forms of dispensation, from the entering of benefices without basic qualifications like literacy for newly appointed priests to the request of a converted Jew to visit his unconverted parents. Popes such as John XXII, Benedict XII, and Clement VI reportedly spent fortunes on expensive wardrobes, and silver and gold plates were used at banquets.\nOverall the public life of leading church members began to resemble the lives of princes rather than members of the clergy. This splendor and corruption at the head of the Church found its way to the lower ranks: when a bishop had to pay up to a year's income for gaining a benefice, he sought ways of raising this money from his new office. This was taken to extremes by the pardoners who sold absolutions for all kinds of sins. While pardoners were hated but popularly regarded as helpful to redeem one's soul, friars were commonly regarded as failing to follow the Church's moral commandments by ignoring their vows of chastity and poverty and were despised. This sentiment strengthened movements calling for a return to absolute poverty, relinquishment of all personal and ecclesiastical belongings, and preaching as the Lord and his disciples had.\nA political Church.\nFor the Catholic Church, an institution embedded in the secular structure and its focus on property, this was a dangerous development, and beginning in the early 14th century, most of these movements were declared heretical. These included the Fraticelli and Waldensian movements in Italy and the Hussites in Bohemia (inspired by John Wycliffe in England). Furthermore, the display of wealth by the upper ranks of the church, which contrasted with the common expectation of poverty and strict adherence to principles, was used by enemies of the papacy to raise charges against the popes; King Philip of France employed this strategy, as did Louis IV, Holy Roman Emperor. In his conflict with the latter, Pope John XXII excommunicated two leading philosophers, Marsilius of Padua and William of Ockham, who were outspoken critics of the papacy, and who had found refuge with Louis IV in Munich. In response, William charged the pope with seventy errors and seven heresies.\nThe proceedings against the Knights Templar in the Council of Vienne are representative of this time, reflecting the various powers and their relationships. In 1314, the collegium at Vienne convened to make a ruling concerning the Templars. The council, overall unconvinced about the guilt of the order as a whole, was unlikely to condemn the entire order based on the scarce evidence brought forward. Exerting massive pressure in order to gain part of the substantial funds of the order, the King managed to get the ruling he wanted, and Pope Clement V ordered by decree the suppression of the order.\nIn the cathedral of Saint Maurice in Vienne, the king of France and his son, the king of Navarre, were sitting next to him when he issued the decree. Under pain of excommunication, no one was allowed to speak at that occasion except when asked by the Pope. The Templars who appeared in Vienne to defend their order were not allowed to present their case\u2014the cardinals of the collegium originally ruled that they should be allowed to raise a defense, but the arrival of the king of France in Vienne put pressure on the collegium, and that decision was revoked.\nPapacy in the 14th century.\nCuria.\nAfter the arrest of the bishop of Pamiers by Philip IV of France in 1301, Pope Boniface VIII issued the bull \"Salvator Mundi\", retracting all privileges granted to the French king by previous popes, and a few weeks later \"Ausculta fili\" with charges against the king, summoning him before a council to Rome. In a bold assertion of papal sovereignty, Boniface declared that \"God has placed us over the Kings and Kingdoms.\"\nIn response, Philip wrote \"Your venerable conceitedness may know, that we are nobody's vassal in temporal matters,\" and called for a meeting of the Estates General, a council of the lords of France, who had supported his position. The king of France issued charges of sodomy, simony, sorcery, and heresy against the pope and summoned him before the council. The pope's response was the strongest affirmation to date of papal sovereignty. In \"Unam sanctam\" (18 November 1302), he decreed that \"it is necessary to salvation that every human creature be subject to the Roman pontiff.\"\nHe was preparing a bull that would excommunicate the king of France and put the interdict over France when in September 1303, William Nogaret, the strongest critic of the papacy in the French inner circle, led a delegation to Rome, with intentionally loose orders by the king to bring the pope, if necessary by force, before a council to rule on the charges brought against him. Nogaret coordinated with the cardinals of the Colonna family, long-standing rivals against whom the pope had even preached a crusade earlier in his papacy. In 1303, French and Italian troops attacked the pope in Anagni, his home town, and arrested him. He was freed three days later by the population of Anagni. Boniface VIII, then 68 years of age, was deeply shattered by this attack on his own person and died a few weeks later.\nCooperation.\nIn reaction to the intransigence of popes like Boniface VIII, the French tightened their influence under the papacy, eventually reducing the popes to puppets and stacking the Papal court with French clerics.\nThe death of Pope Boniface VIII deprived the papacy of its most able politician who could stand against the secular power of the king of France. After the conciliatory papacy of Benedict XI (1303\u201304), Pope Clement V (1305\u20131314) became the next pontiff. He was born in Gascony, in southern France, but was not directly connected to the French court. He owed his election to the French clerics. He decided against moving to Rome and established his court in Avignon. In this situation of dependency on powerful neighbours in France, three principles characterized the politics of Clement V: the suppression of heretic movements (such as the Cathars in southern France); the reorganization of the internal administration of the church; and the preservation of an untainted image of the church as the sole instrument of God's will on earth.\nThe latter was directly challenged by Philip IV when he demanded a posthumous trial of his former adversary, the late Boniface VIII, for alleged heresy. Philip exerted strong influence on the cardinals of the collegium, and compliance with his demand could mean a severe blow to the church's authority. Much of Clement's politics was designed to avoid such a blow, which he finally did (persuading Philip to leave the trial to the Council of Vienne, where it lapsed). However, the price won concessions on various fronts; despite strong personal doubts, Clement supported Philip's proceedings against the Templars, and he personally ruled to suppress the order.\nOne important issue during the papacy of Pope John XXII (born Jacques Du\u00e8ze in Cahors, and previously archbishop in Avignon) was his conflict with Louis IV, Holy Roman Emperor, who denied the sole authority of the pope to crown the emperor. Louis followed the example of Philip IV, and summoned the nobles of Germany to back his position. Marsilius of Padua justified secular supremacy in the territory of the Holy Roman Empire. This conflict with the Emperor, often fought out in expensive wars, drove the papacy even more into the arms of the French king.\nPope Benedict XII (1334\u20131342), born Jacques Fournier in Pamiers, was previously active in the inquisition against the Cathar movement. In contrast to the rather bloody picture of the Inquisition in general, he was reported to be very careful about the souls of the examined, taking a lot of time in the proceedings. His interest in pacifying southern France was also motivation for mediating between the king of France and the king of England, before the outbreak of the Hundred Years' War.\nSubmission.\nUnder Pope Clement VI (1342\u20131352) the French interests started dominating the papacy. Clement VI had been Archbishop of Rouen and adviser to Philip IV before, so his links to the French court were much stronger than those of his predecessors. At some point he even financed French war efforts out of his own pockets. He reportedly loved luxurious wardrobe and under his rule the extravagant life style in Avignon reached new heights.\nClement VI was also pope during the Black Death, the epidemic that swept through Europe between 1347 and 1350 and is believed to have killed about one-third of Europe's population. Also during his reign in 1348, the Avignon papacy bought the city of Avignon from the Angevins.\nPope Innocent VI (1352\u20131362), born Etienne Aubert, was less partisan than Clement VI. He was keen on establishing peace between France and England, having worked to this end in papal delegations in 1345 and 1348. His gaunt appearance and austere manners commanded higher respect in the eyes of nobles at both sides of the conflict. However, he was also indecisive and impressionable, already an old man when being elected Pope. In this situation, the king of France managed to influence the papacy, although papal legates played key roles in various attempts to stop the conflict.\nMost notably in 1353, the bishop of Porto, Guy de Boulogne, tried to set up a conference. After initial successful talks the effort failed, largely due to the mistrust from the English side over Guy's strong ties with the French court. In a letter Innocent VI himself wrote to the Duke of Lancaster: \"Although we were born in France and although for that and other reasons we hold the realm of France in special affection, yet in working for peace we have put aside our private prejudices and tried to serve the interests of everyone.\"\nWith Pope Urban V (1362\u20131370), the control by Charles V of France of the papacy became more direct. Urban V himself is described as the most austere of the Avignon popes after Benedict XII and probably the most spiritual of all. However, he was not a strategist and made substantial concessions to the French crown especially in finances, a crucial issue during the war with England. In 1369, Pope Urban V supported the marriage of Philip the Bold of the Duchy of Burgundy and Margaret III, Countess of Flanders, rather than giving dispensation to one of Edward III of England's sons to marry Margaret. This clearly showed the partisanship of the papacy; correspondingly, the respect for the church dropped.\nWar of the Eight Saints.\nThe most influential decision in the reign of Pope Gregory XI (1370\u20131378) was the return to Rome, beginning on 13 September 1376 and ending with his arrival on 17 January 1377. Although the Pope was French born and still under strong influence by the French king, the increasing conflict between factions friendly and hostile to the Pope posed a threat to the papal lands and to the allegiance of Rome itself. When the papacy established an embargo against grain exports during a food scarcity 1374 and 1375, Florence organized several cities into a league against the papacy: Milan, Bologna, Perugia, Pisa, Lucca and Genoa.\nThe papal legate, Robert of Geneva, a relative of the House of Savoy, pursued a particularly ruthless policy against the league to re-establish control over these cities. He convinced Pope Gregory to hire Breton mercenaries. To quell an uprising of the inhabitants of Cesena he hired John Hawkwood and had the majority of the people massacred (between 2,500 and 3,500 people were reported dead). Following such events opposition against the papacy strengthened.\nFlorence came in open conflict with the pope, a conflict called \"the war of the eight saints\" in reference to the eight Florentine councilors who were chosen to orchestrate the conflict. The entire city of Florence was excommunicated and as reply the forwarding of clerical taxes was stopped. Trade was seriously hampered and both sides had to find a solution. In his decision about returning to Rome, the pope was also under the influence of Catherine of Siena, later canonized, who preached for a return to Rome.\nSchism.\nThis resolution was short-lived when, having returned the papal court to Rome, Pope Gregory XI died. A conclave met and elected an Italian pope, Urban VI. Pope Urban alienated the French cardinals, who held a second conclave electing one of their own, Robert of Geneva, who took the name Clement VII, to succeed Gregory XI, thus beginning a second line of Avignon popes. Clement VII and his successors are not regarded as legitimate, and are referred to as antipopes by the Catholic Church. This situation, known as the Western Schism, persisted from 1378 until the ecumenical Council of Constance (1414\u20131418) settled the question of papal succession and declared the French conclave of 1378 to be invalid. A new pope, Pope Martin V, was elected in 1417; other claimants to succeed to Avignon line (though not resident at Avignon) continued until c. 1437.\nLegacy.\nThe period has been called the \"Babylonian captivity\" of the popes. When and where this term originated is uncertain although it may have sprung from Petrarch, who in a letter to a friend (1340\u20131353) written during his stay at Avignon, described Avignon of that time as the \"Babylon of the west\", referring to the worldly practices of the church hierarchy. The nickname is polemical, in referring to the claim by critics that the prosperity of the church at that time was accompanied by a profound compromise of the papacy's spiritual integrity, especially in the alleged subordination of the powers of the Church to the ambitions of the French kings. As noted, the \"captivity\" of the popes at Avignon lasted about the same amount of time as the exile of the Jews in Babylon, making the analogy convenient and rhetorically potent. The Avignon papacy has been and is often today depicted as being totally dependent on the French kings, and sometimes as even being treacherous to its spiritual role and its heritage in Rome.\nAlmost a century and a half later, Protestant reformer Martin Luther wrote his treatise \"On the Babylonian Captivity of the Church\" (1520), but he claimed it had nothing to do with the Western Schism or papacy in Avignon.\nEffects on the papacy.\nThe relationship between the papacy and France changed drastically over the course of the 14th century. Starting with open conflict between Pope Boniface VIII and King Philip IV of France, it turned to cooperation from 1305 to 1342, and finally to a papacy under strong influence by the French throne up to 1378. Such partisanship of the papacy was one of the reasons for the dropping esteem for the institution, which in turn was one of the reasons for the schism from 1378 to 1417.\nIn the period of the Schism, the power struggle in the papacy became a battlefield of the major powers, with France supporting the antipopes in Avignon and England supporting the popes in Rome. At the end of the century, still in the state of schism, the papacy had lost most of its direct political power, and the nation states of France and England were established as two of the main powers in Europe.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

In 1965 she formed the company Twyla Tharp Dance, which merged with American Ballet Theatre in 1988. She regrouped the company in 1991. Her work often uses classical, jazz, and contemporary pop music.\nFrom 1971 to 1988, Twyla Tharp Dance toured extensively around the world, performing original works. In 1973 Tharp choreographed \"Deuce Coupe\" to the music of The Beach Boys for the Joffrey Ballet. \"Deuce Coupe\" is considered the first \"crossover ballet\", a mix of ballet and modern dance. Later she choreographed \"Push Comes to Shove\" (1976), which featured Mikhail Baryshnikov and is now thought to be the best example of crossover ballet.\nOn May 24, 2018, Tharp was awarded an honorary Doctor of Arts degree by Harvard University.\nEarly life and education.\nTharp was born in 1941 on a farm in Portland, Indiana, the daughter of William Tharp and Lecile (Confer) Tharp. She was named for Twila Thornburg, the \"Pig Princess\" of the 89th Annual Muncie Fair.\nAs a child, Tharp spent a few months each year living with her Quaker grandparents on their farm in Indiana. Tharp's mother insisted she take lessons in dance, various musical instruments, shorthand, German and French. In 1950, Tharp's family\u2014younger sister Twanette, twin brothers Stanley and Stanford, and her parents\u2014moved to Rialto, California. William and Lecile operated Tharp Motors and Tharp Autos in Rialto. They also opened a drive-in theater, where Tharp worked. She attended Pacific High School in San Bernardino, studied at the Vera Lynn School of Dance, and studied ballet with Beatrice Collenette. A \"devoted bookworm\", Tharp has said her schedule left little time for a social life. She attended Pomona College, but transferred to Barnard College after being caught making out with her boyfriend and threatened with expulsion. She graduated from Barnard with a degree in art history in 1963. In New York City, she studied with Richard Thomas, Martha Graham and Merce Cunningham. In 1963, Tharp joined the Paul Taylor Dance Company.\nCareer.\nDances and ballets.\nIn 1965, Tharp choreographed her first dance, \"Tank Dive\", and formed her own company, Twyla Tharp Dance. Her work often utilizes classical music, jazz, and contemporary pop music. From 1971 to 1988, Twyla Tharp Dance toured extensively around the world, performing original works.\nIn 1973, Tharp choreographed \"Deuce Coupe\" to the music of The Beach Boys for the Joffrey Ballet. \"Deuce Coupe\" is considered the first crossover ballet. Later she choreographed \"Push Comes to Shove\" (1976), which featured Mikhail Baryshnikov and is now thought to be the best example of crossover ballet.\nIn 1988, Twyla Tharp Dance merged with American Ballet Theatre, since which time ABT has premiered 16 of Tharp's works. In 2010 it had 20 of her works in its repertory. Tharp has since choreographed dances for Paris Opera Ballet, The Royal Ballet, New York City Ballet, Boston Ballet, Joffrey Ballet, Pacific Northwest Ballet, Miami City Ballet, American Ballet Theatre, Hubbard Street Dance and Martha Graham Dance Company. She also created the dance roadshow \"Cutting Up\" (1992) with Baryshnikov, which went on to tour and appeared in 28 cities over two months.\nIn 1995, Twyla Tharp held auditions globally to find new talent, forming what would become the three-year touring project \"Tharp!\" During this time, she set over six new works on the troupe, including \"Heroes\" featuring music by Philip Glass, \"Diabelli\" to the music of Ludwig van Beethoven, \"Roy\u2019s Joys\" set to the music of Roy Eldridge, and \"Sweet Fields\", set to 19th century Shaker hymns. In 1998, her piece \"Yamay\u00e1\", infused with the sounds of the Buena Vista Social Club, premiered at Memorial Auditorium, Stanford University. After completing its third year of touring internationally, \"Tharp!\" was discontinued at the end of 1998. Several of its members went on to prominence in the dance world, including principals at the Royal Ballet and the Metropolitan Opera, as well as launching the career of notable choreographer Jessica Lang, who made her professional debut in \"Tharp!\" after being recruited directly out of the Juilliard School.\nIn 2000, Twyla Tharp Dance regrouped with entirely new dancers. This company also performed around the world, and with it Tharp developed the material that became \"Movin' Out,\" an award-winning Broadway musical featuring the songs of Billy Joel and starring many of the dancers in the company.\nIn 2012, Tharp created the full-length ballet \"The Princess and the Goblin\", based on George MacDonald's story \"The Princess and the Goblin\". It is her first ballet to include children, and was co-commissioned by Atlanta Ballet and Royal Winnipeg Ballet and performed by both companies.\nTharp was the first Artist in Residency (A.I.R.) at Pacific Northwest Ballet in Seattle. During this time she created and premiered \"Waiting At The Station\", a work with music by R&amp;B artist Allen Toussaint and sets and costumes by longtime collaborator Santo Loquasto.\nBroadway.\nIn 1980, Tharp's work first appeared on Broadway with Twyla Tharp Dance performing \"When We Were Very Young\", followed in 1981 by \"The Catherine Wheel\", her collaboration with David Byrne at the Winter Garden. \"Wheel\" was broadcast on PBS and its soundtrack released on LP. Her dance piece \"Fait Accompli\" was set to music by David Van Tieghem as released on the These Things Happen LP (1984).\nIn 1985, her staging of \"Singin' in the Rain\" played at the Gershwin for 367 performances.\nTharp premiered her dance musical \"Movin' Out\", set to the music and lyrics of Billy Joel, in Chicago in 2001. The show opened on Broadway in 2002. \"Movin' Out\" ran for 1,331 performances on Broadway. A national tour opened in January 2004. It received 10 Tony nominations and Tharp won Best Choreographer.\nTharp opened a new show, \"The Times They Are a-Changin, to the music of Bob Dylan in 2005 at The Old Globe Theatre in San Diego. \"The Times They are A-Changin set the records for the highest-grossing show and highest ticket sales as of the date of closing (March 2006). It was also the first show to receive a second extension before the first preview. After its run in California, the New York show ran for 35 previews and 28 performances.\nIn 2009, Tharp worked with the songs of Frank Sinatra to mount \"Come Fly with Me\", which ran at the Alliance Theater in Atlanta and was the best-selling four-week run as of the date of closing in 2009. Renamed \"Come Fly Away\", the show opened on Broadway in 2010 at the Marquis Theatre and ran for 26 previews and 188 performances. \"Come Fly Away,\" was retooled and opened under the title \"Sinatra: Dance with Me\" at The Wynn Las Vegas in 2011. \"Come Fly Away\" National Tour opened in Atlanta in August 2011.\nFilm and television.\nTharp collaborated with film directors Milo\u0161 Forman on \"Hair\" (1978), \"Ragtime\" (1980) and \"Amadeus\" (1983); Taylor Hackford on \"White Nights\" (1985); and James Brooks on \"I'll Do Anything\" (1994).\nHer television credits include choreographing \"Sue's Leg\" (1976) for the inaugural episode of the PBS program \"Dance in America\"; co-producing and directing \"Making Television Dance\" (1977), which won the Chicago International Film Festival Award; and directing \"The Catherine Wheel\" (1983) for BBC Television. Tharp co-directed the award-winning television special \"Baryshnikov by Tharp\" in 1984.\nAuthor.\nTharp has written four books: an early autobiography, \"Push Comes to Shove\" (1992; Bantam Books); \"The Creative Habit: Learn It and Use It for Life\" (2003, Simon &amp; Schuster), translated into Spanish, Chinese, Russian, Korean, Thai and Japanese; \"The Collaborative Habit\" (2009, Simon &amp; Schuster), translated into Thai, Chinese and Korean; and \"Keep It Moving\" (2019). She has said that \"The Creative Habit\" is about cybernetics, especially in the several Greek-themed creative exercises, such as the Coin Drop; the Coin Drop, as an exercise in extracting ordered meaning from chaos, is derived from the astrological muse Urania, in that random coins falling onto a flat surface can be used to develop pattern analysis skills. The astrological theme is an etymological underpinning of cybernetics' tradition of \"guiding a boat\" by sighting stellar references according to ancient Greek navigation.\nWorks chronology.\nDances/ballets/theatre.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nHonors and awards.\nTharp has received two Emmy Awards, 19 honorary doctorates, the Vietnam Veterans of America President's Award, the 2004 National Medal of the Arts, and numerous grants, including a MacArthur Fellowship.

{"id": "38180", "revid": "49214", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=38180", "title": "Clothing", "text": "Objects worn to cover the body\nClothing (also known as clothes, garments, dress, apparel, or attire) is any item worn on a human body. Typically, clothing is made of fabrics or textiles, but over time it has included garments made from animal skin and other thin sheets of materials and natural products found in the environment, put together. The wearing of clothing is mostly restricted to human beings and is a feature of all human societies. The amount and type of clothing worn depends on gender, body type, social factors, and geographic considerations. Garments cover the body, footwear covers the feet, gloves cover the hands, while hats and headgear cover the head, and underwear covers the intimate parts.\nClothing serves many purposes: it can serve as protection from the elements, rough surfaces, sharp stones, rash-causing plants, and insect bites, by providing a barrier between the skin and the environment. Clothing can insulate against cold or hot conditions, and it can provide a hygienic barrier, keeping infectious and toxic materials away from the body. It can protect feet from injury and discomfort or facilitate navigation in varied environments. Clothing also provides protection from ultraviolet radiation. It may be used to prevent glare or increase visual acuity in harsh environments, such as brimmed hats. Clothing is used for protection against injury in specific tasks and occupations, sports, and warfare. Fashioned with pockets, belts, or loops, clothing may provide a means to carry things while freeing the hands.\nClothing has significant social factors as well. Wearing clothes is a variable social norm. It may connote modesty. Being deprived of clothing in front of others may be embarrassing. In many parts of the world, not wearing clothes in public so that genitals, breast, or buttocks are visible could be considered indecent exposure. Pubic area or genital coverage is the most frequently encountered minimum found cross-culturally and regardless of climate, implying social convention as the basis of customs. Clothing also may be used to communicate social status, wealth, group identity, and individualism.\nSome forms of personal protective equipment amount to clothing, such as coveralls, chaps or a doctor's white coat, with similar requirements for maintenance and cleaning as other textiles (boxing gloves function both as protective equipment and as a sparring weapon, so the equipment aspect rises above the glove aspect). More specialized forms of protective equipment, such as face shields are classified as protective accessories. At the far extreme, self-enclosing diving suits or space suits are form-fitting body covers, and amount to a form of dress, without being clothing per se, while containing enough high technology to amount to more of a tool than a garment. This line will continue to blur as wearable technology embeds assistive devices directly into the fabric itself; the enabling innovations are ultra low power consumption and flexible electronic substrates.\nClothing also hybridizes into a personal transportation system (ice skates, roller skates, cargo pants, other outdoor survival gear, one-man band) or concealment system (stage magicians, hidden linings or pockets in tradecraft, integrated holsters for concealed carry, merchandise-laden trench coats on the black market \u2014 where the purpose of the clothing often carries over into disguise). A mode of dress fit to purpose, whether stylistic or functional, is known as an outfit or ensemble.\nOrigin and history.\nEarly use.\nEstimates of when humans began wearing clothes vary from 40,000 to as many as 3\u00a0million years ago. A study in 2003 suggested humans were wearing clothing at least 100,000 years ago from evidence about lice. Human body lice cannot live outside of clothing, dying after only a few hours without shelter. This strongly implies that the date of the body louse's speciation from its parent, \"Pediculus humanus\", can have taken place no earlier than the earliest human adoption of clothing. This date, at which the body louse (\"P. humanus corporis\") diverged from both its parent species and its sibling subspecies, the head louse (\"P. humanus capitis\"), has been estimated to between 40,000 to 170,000 years before present. However, recent transcriptome analyses casts doubt on whether lice provide a means to date the origin of clothes since it has found that \"body and head lice were almost genetically identical. Indeed, the phenotypic flexibility associated with the emergence of body lice, is probably a result of regulatory changes, perhaps epigenetic in origin, triggered by environmental signals.\" \nDating with direct archeological evidence produces dates consistent with those of lice. In September 2021, scientists reported evidence of clothes being made 120,000 years ago based on findings in deposits in Morocco.\nThe development of clothing is deeply connected to human evolution, with early garments likely consisting of animal skins and natural fibers adapted for protection and social signaling. According to anthropologists and archaeologists, the earliest clothing likely consisted of fur, leather, leaves, or grass that was draped, wrapped, or tied around the body. Knowledge of such clothing remains inferential, as clothing materials deteriorate quickly compared with stone, bone, shell, and metal artifacts. Archeologists have identified very early sewing needles of bone and ivory from about 30,000\u00a0BC, found near Kostenki, Russia in 1988, and in 2016 a needle at least 50,000 years old from Denisova Cave in Siberia made by Denisovans. Dyed flax fibers that date back to 34,000\u00a0BC and could have been used in clothing have been found in a prehistoric cave in Georgia.\nThe oldest known piece of woven clothing is the Tarkhan dress, an over 5000 year old linen garment.\nMaking clothing.\nSeveral distinct human cultures, including those residing in the Arctic Circle, have historically crafted their garments exclusively from treated and adorned animal furs and skins. In contrast, numerous other societies have complemented or substituted leather and skins with textiles woven, knitted, or twined from a diverse array of animal and plant fibers, such as wool, linen, cotton, silk, hemp, and ramie.\nAlthough modern consumers may take the production of clothing for granted, making fabric by hand is a tedious and labor-intensive process involving fiber making, spinning, and weaving. The textile industry was the first to be mechanized\u00a0\u2013 with the powered loom\u00a0\u2013 during the Industrial Revolution.\nDifferent cultures have evolved various ways of creating clothes out of cloth. One approach involves draping the cloth. Many people wore, and still wear, garments consisting of rectangles of cloth wrapped to fit\u00a0\u2013 for example, the dhoti for men and the sari for women in the Indian subcontinent, the Scottish kilt, and the Javanese sarong. The clothes may be tied up (dhoti and sari) or implement pins or belts to hold the garments in place (kilt and sarong). The cloth remains uncut, and people of various sizes can wear the garment.\nAnother approach involves measuring, cutting, and sewing the cloth by hand or with a sewing machine. Clothing can be cut from a sewing pattern and adjusted by a tailor to the wearer's measurements. An adjustable sewing mannequin or dress form is used to create form-fitting clothing. If the fabric is expensive, the tailor tries to use every bit of the cloth rectangle in constructing the clothing; perhaps cutting triangular pieces from one corner of the cloth, and adding them elsewhere as gussets. Traditional European patterns for shirts and chemises take this approach. These remnants can also be reused to make patchwork pockets, hats, vests, and skirts.\nModern European fashion treats cloth much less conservatively, typically cutting in such a way as to leave various odd-shaped cloth remnants. Industrial sewing operations sell these as waste; domestic sewers may turn them into quilts.\nIn the thousands of years that humans have been making clothing, they have created an astonishing array of styles, many of which have been reconstructed from surviving garments, photographs, paintings, mosaics, etc., as well as from written descriptions. Costume history can inspire current fashion designers, as well as costumiers for plays, films, television, and historical reenactment.\nClothing as comfort.\nComfort is related to various perceptions, physiological, social, and psychological needs, and after food, it is clothing that satisfies these comfort needs. Clothing provides aesthetic, tactile, thermal, moisture, and pressure comfort.\nFunctions.\nThe most obvious function of clothing is to protect the wearer from the elements. It serves to prevent wind damage and provides protection from sunburn. In the cold, it offers thermal insulation. Shelter can reduce the functional need for clothing. For example, coats, hats, gloves, and other outer layers are normally removed when entering a warm place. Similarly, clothing has seasonal and regional aspects so that thinner materials and fewer layers of clothing generally are worn in warmer regions and seasons than in colder ones. Boots, hats, jackets, ponchos, and coats designed to protect from rain and snow are specialized clothing items.\nClothing has been made from a wide variety of materials, ranging from leather and furs to woven fabrics, to elaborate and exotic natural and synthetic fabrics. Not all body coverings are regarded as clothing. Articles carried rather than worn normally are considered accessories rather than clothing (such as Handbags), items worn on a single part of the body and easily removed (scarves), worn purely for adornment (jewelry), or items that do not serve a protective function. For instance, corrective eyeglasses, Arctic goggles, and sunglasses would not be considered an accessory because of their protective functions.\nClothing protects against many things that might injure or irritate the naked human body, including rain, snow, wind, and other weather, as well as from the sun. Garments that are too sheer, thin, small, or tight offer less protection. Appropriate clothes can also reduce risk during activities such as work or sport. Some clothing protects from specific hazards, such as insects, toxic chemicals, weather, weapons, and contact with abrasive substances.\nHumans have devised clothing solutions to environmental or other hazards: such as space suits, armor, diving suits, swimsuits, bee-keeper gear, motorcycle leathers, high-visibility clothing, and other pieces of protective clothing. The distinction between clothing and protective equipment is not always clear-cut since clothes designed to be fashionable often have protective value, and clothes designed for function often have corporate fashion in their design.\nThe choice of clothes also has social implications. They cover parts of the body that social norms require to be covered, act as a form of adornment, and serve other social purposes. Someone who lacks the means to procure appropriate clothing due to poverty or affordability, or lack of inclination, sometimes is said to be worn, ragged, or shabby.\nClothing performs a range of social and cultural functions, such as individual, occupational, gender differentiation, and social status. In many societies, norms about clothing reflect standards of modesty, religion, gender, and social status. Clothing may also function as adornment and an expression of personal taste or style.\nScholarship.\nFunction of clothing.\nSerious books on clothing and its functions appear from the nineteenth century as European colonial powers interacted with new environments such as tropical ones in Asia. Some scientific research into the multiple functions of clothing in the first half of the twentieth century, with publications such as J.C. Fl\u00fcgel's \"Psychology of Clothes\" in 1930, and Newburgh's seminal \"Physiology of Heat Regulation and The Science of Clothing\" in 1949. By 1968, the field of Environmental Physiology had advanced and expanded significantly, but the science of clothing in relation to environmental physiology had changed little. There has since been considerable research, and the knowledge base has grown significantly, but the main concepts remain unchanged, and indeed, Newburgh's book continues to be cited by contemporary authors, including those attempting to develop thermoregulatory models of clothing development.\nHistory of clothing.\nClothing reveals much about human history. According to Professor Kiki Smith of Smith College, garments preserved in collections are resources for study similar to books and paintings. Scholars around the world have studied a wide range of clothing topics, including the history of specific items of clothing, clothing styles in different cultural groups, and the business of clothing and fashion. The textile curator Linda Baumgarten writes that \"clothing provides a remarkable picture of the daily lives, beliefs, expectations, and hopes of those who lived in the past.\nClothing presents a number of challenges to historians. Clothing made of textiles or skins is subject to decay, and the erosion of physical integrity may be seen as a loss of cultural information. Costume collections often focus on important pieces of clothing considered unique or otherwise significant, limiting the opportunities scholars have to study everyday clothing.\nCultural aspects.\nClothing has long served as a marker of social status, gender, and cultural identity, reflecting broader societal structures and values.\nGender differentiation.\nIn most cultures, gender differentiation of clothing is considered appropriate. The differences are in styles, colors, fabrics, and types.\nIn contemporary Western societies, skirts, dresses, and high-heeled shoes are usually seen as women's clothing, while neckties usually are seen as men's clothing. Trousers were once seen as exclusively men's clothing, but nowadays are worn by both genders. Men's clothes are often more practical (that is, they can function well under a wide variety of situations), but a wider range of clothing styles is available for women. Typically, men are allowed to bare their chests in a greater variety of public places. It is generally common for a woman to wear clothing perceived as masculine, while the opposite is seen as unusual. Contemporary men may sometimes choose to wear men's skirts such as togas or kilts in particular cultures, especially on ceremonial occasions. In previous times, such garments often were worn as normal daily clothing by men.\nIn some cultures, sumptuary laws regulate what men and women are required to wear. Islam requires women to wear certain forms of attire, usually hijab. What items required varies in different Muslim societies; however, women are usually required to cover more of their bodies than men. Articles of clothing Muslim women wear under these laws or traditions range from the head-scarf to the burqa.\nSome contemporary clothing styles designed to be worn by either gender, such as T-shirts, have started out as menswear, but some articles, such as the fedora, originally were a style for women.\nSocial status.\nDuring the early modern period, individuals utilized their attire as a significant method of conveying and asserting their social status. Individuals employed the utilization of high-quality fabrics and trendy designs as a means of communicating their wealth and social standing, as well as an indication of their knowledge and understanding of current fashion trends to the general public. As a result, clothing played a significant role in making the social hierarchy perceptible to all members of society.\nIn some societies, clothing may be used to indicate rank or status. In ancient Rome, for example, only senators could wear garments dyed with Tyrian purple. In traditional Hawaiian society, only high-ranking chiefs could wear feather cloaks and palaoa, or carved whale teeth. In China, before establishment of the republic, only the emperor could wear yellow. History provides many examples of elaborate sumptuary laws that regulated what people could wear. In societies without such laws, which includes most modern societies, social status is signaled by the purchase of rare or luxury items that are limited by cost to those with wealth or status. In addition, peer pressure influences clothing choice.\nReligion.\nSome religious clothing might be considered a special case of occupational clothing. Sometimes it is worn only during the performance of religious ceremonies. However, it may be worn every day as a marker for special religious status. Sikhs wear a turban as it is a part of their religion.\nIn some religions such as Hinduism, Sikhism, Buddhism, and Jainism the cleanliness of religious dresses is of paramount importance and considered to indicate purity. Jewish ritual requires rending (tearing) of one's upper garment as a sign of mourning. The Quran says about husbands and wives, regarding clothing: \"...They are clothing/covering (Libaas) for you; and you for them\" (chapter 2:187). Christian clergy members wear religious vestments during liturgical services and may wear specific non-liturgical clothing at other times.\nClothing appears in numerous contexts in the Bible. The most prominent passages are: the story of Adam and Eve who made coverings for themselves out of fig leaves, Joseph's coat of many colors, and the clothing of Judah and Tamar, Mordecai and Esther. Furthermore, the priests officiating in the Temple in Jerusalem had very specific garments, the lack of which made one liable to death.\nContemporary clothing.\nWestern dress code.\nThe Western dress code has changed over the past 500+ years. The mechanization of the textile industry made many varieties of cloth widely available at affordable prices. Styles have changed, and the availability of synthetic fabrics has changed the definition of what is \"stylish\". In the latter half of the twentieth century, blue jeans became very popular, and are now worn to events that normally demand formal attire. Activewear has also become a large and growing market.\nIn the Western dress code, jeans are worn by both men and women. There are several unique styles of jeans found that include: high rise jeans, mid rise jeans, low rise jeans, bootcut jeans, straight jeans, cropped jeans, skinny jeans, cuffed jeans, boyfriend jeans, and capri jeans.\nThe licensing of designer names was pioneered by designers such as Pierre Cardin, Yves Saint Laurent, and Guy Laroche in the 1960s and has been a common practice within the fashion industry from about the 1970s. Among the more popular include Marc Jacobs and Gucci, named for Marc Jacobs and Guccio Gucci respectively.\nSpread of western styles.\nBy the early years of the twenty-first century, western clothing styles had, to some extent, become international styles. This process began hundreds of years earlier, during the periods of European colonialism. The process of cultural dissemination has been perpetuated over the centuries, spreading Western culture and styles, most recently as Western media corporations have penetrated markets throughout the world. Fast fashion clothing has also become a global phenomenon. These garments are less expensive, mass-produced Western clothing. Also, donated used clothing from Western countries is delivered to people in poor countries by charity organizations.\nEthnic and cultural heritage.\nPeople may wear ethnic or national dress on special occasions or in certain roles or occupations. For example, most Korean men and women have adopted Western-style dress for daily wear, but still wear traditional hanboks on special occasions, such as weddings and cultural holidays. Also, items of Western dress may be worn or accessorized in distinctive, non-Western ways. A Tongan man may combine a used T-shirt with a Tongan wrapped skirt, or tupenu.\nSport and activity.\nFor practical, comfort or safety reasons, most sports and physical activities are practised wearing special clothing. Common sportswear garments include shorts, T-shirts, tennis shirts, leotards, tracksuits, and trainers. Specialized garments include wet suits (for swimming, diving, or surfing), salopettes (for skiing), and leotards (for gymnastics). Also, spandex materials often are used as base layers to soak up sweat. Spandex is preferable for active sports that require form fitting garments, such as volleyball, wrestling, track and field, dance, gymnastics, and swimming.\nFashion.\nParis set the 1900\u20131940 fashion trends for Europe and North America. Day dresses had drop waists, sashes or belts around the low waist or hip and a skirt that hung anywhere from the ankle on up to the knee. Day wear had sleeves (long to mid-bicep) and a skirt that was straight, pleated, hank hemmed, or tiered. Jewelry was not conspicuous. Hair was often bobbed, giving a boyish look.\nIn the early twenty-first century a diverse range of styles exists in fashion, varying by geography, exposure to modern media, economic conditions, and ranging from expensive haute couture, to traditional garb, to thrift store grunge. Fashion shows are events for designers to show off new and often extravagant designs.\nPolitical issues.\nWorking conditions in the garments industry.\nAlthough mechanization transformed most aspects of human clothing industry, by the mid-twentieth century, garment workers have continued to labor under challenging conditions that demand repetitive manual labor. Often, mass-produced clothing is made in what are considered by some to be sweatshops, typified by long work hours, lack of benefits, and lack of worker representation. While most examples of such conditions are found in developing countries, clothes made in industrialized nations may also be manufactured under similar conditions.\nCoalitions of NGOs, designers (including Katharine Hamnett, American Apparel, Veja, Quiksilver, eVocal, and Edun), and campaign groups such as the Clean Clothes Campaign (CCC) and the Institute for Global Labour and Human Rights as well as textile and clothing trade unions have sought to improve these conditions by sponsoring awareness-raising events, which draw the attention of both the media and the general public to the plight of the workers.\nOutsourcing production to low wage countries such as Bangladesh, China, India, Indonesia, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka became possible when the Multi Fibre Agreement (MFA) was abolished. The MFA, which placed quotas on textiles imports, was deemed a protectionist measure. Although many countries recognize treaties such as the International Labour Organization, which attempt to set standards for worker safety and rights, many countries have made exceptions to certain parts of the treaties or failed to thoroughly enforce them. India for example has not ratified sections 87 and 92 of the treaty.\nThe production of textiles has functioned as a consistent industry for developing nations, providing work and wages, whether construed as exploitative or not, to millions of people.\nFur.\nThe use of animal fur in clothing dates to prehistoric times. Currently, although fur is still used by indigenous people in arctic zones and higher elevations for its warmth and protection, in developed countries it is associated with expensive, designer clothing. Once uncontroversial, recently it has been the focus of campaigns on the grounds that campaigners consider it cruel and unnecessary. PETA and other animal and animal liberation groups have called attention to fur farming and other practices they consider cruel.\nReal fur in fashion is contentious, with Copenhagen (2022) and London (2018) fashion weeks banning real fur in its runway shows following protests and government attention to the issue. Fashion houses such as Gucci and Chanel have banned the use of fur in its garments. Versace and Furla also stopped using fur in their collections in early 2018. In 2020, the outdoor brand Canada Goose announced it would discontinue the use of new coyote fur on parka trims following protests.\nGoverning bodies have issued legislation banning the sale of new real fur garments. In 2021, Israel was the first government to ban the sale of real fur garments, with the exception of those worn as part of a religious faith. In 2019, the state of California banned fur trapping, with a total ban on the sale of all new fur garments except those made of sheep, cow, and rabbit fur going into effect on 1 January 2023.\nLife cycle.\nClothing maintenance.\nClothing suffers assault both from within and without. The human body sheds skin cells and body oils, and it exudes sweat, urine, and feces that may soil clothing. From the outside, sun damage, moisture, abrasion, and dirt assault garments. Fleas and lice can hide in seams. If not cleaned and refurbished, clothing becomes worn and loses its aesthetics and functionality (as when buttons fall off, seams come undone, fabrics thin or tear, and zippers fail).\nOften, people wear an item of clothing until it falls apart. Some materials present problems. Cleaning leather is difficult, and bark cloth (tapa) cannot be washed without dissolving it. Owners may patch tears and rips, and brush off surface dirt, but materials such as these inevitably age.\nMost clothing consists of cloth, however, and most cloth can be laundered and mended (patching, darning, but compare felt).\nLaundry, ironing, storage.\nHumans have developed many specialized methods for laundering clothing, ranging from early methods of pounding clothes against rocks in running streams, to the latest in electronic washing machines and dry cleaning (dissolving dirt in solvents other than water). Hot water washing (boiling), chemical cleaning, and ironing are all traditional methods of sterilizing fabrics for hygiene purposes.\nMany kinds of clothing are designed to be ironed before they are worn to remove wrinkles. Most modern formal and semi-formal clothing is in this category (for example, dress shirts and suits). Ironed clothes are believed to look clean, fresh, and neat. Much contemporary casual clothing is made of knit materials that do not readily wrinkle, and do not require ironing. Some clothing is permanent press, having been treated with a coating (such as polytetrafluoroethylene) that suppresses wrinkles and creates a smooth appearance without ironing. Excess lint or debris may end up on the clothing in between launderings. In such cases, a lint remover may be useful.\nOnce clothes have been laundered and possibly ironed, usually they are hung on clothes hangers or folded, to keep them fresh until they are worn. Clothes are folded to allow them to be stored compactly, to prevent creasing, to preserve creases, or to present them in a more pleasing manner, for instance, when they are put on sale in stores.\nCertain types of insects and larvae feed on clothing and textiles, such as the black carpet beetle and clothing moths. To deter such pests, clothes may be stored in cedar-lined closets or chests, or placed in drawers or containers with materials having pest repellent properties, such as lavender or mothballs. Airtight containers (such as sealed, heavy-duty plastic bags) may deter insect pest damage to clothing materials as well.\nNon-iron.\nA resin used for making non-wrinkle shirts releases formaldehyde, which could cause contact dermatitis for some people; no disclosure requirements exist, and in 2008 the U.S. Government Accountability Office tested formaldehyde in clothing and found that generally the highest levels were in non-wrinkle shirts and pants. In 1999, a study of the effect of washing on the formaldehyde levels found that after six months of routine washing, 7 of 27 shirts still had levels in excess of 75 ppm (the safe limit for direct skin exposure).\nMending.\nWhen the raw material\u00a0\u2013 cloth\u00a0\u2013 was worth more than labor, it made sense to expend labor in saving it. In past times, mending was an art. A meticulous tailor or seamstress could mend rips with thread raveled from hems and seam edges so skillfully that the tear was practically invisible. Today clothing is considered a consumable item. Mass-manufactured clothing is less expensive than the labor required to repair it. Many people buy a new piece of clothing rather than spend time mending. The thrifty still replace zippers and buttons and sew up ripped hems, however. Other mending techniques include darning and invisible mending or upcycling through visible mending inspired in Japanese Sashiko.\nRecycling.\nIt is estimated that 80 billion to 150 billion garments are produced annually. Used, unwearable clothing can be repurposed for quilts, rags, rugs, bandages, and many other household uses. Neutral colored or undyed cellulose fibers can be recycled into paper. In Western societies, used clothing is often thrown out or donated to charity (such as through a clothing bin). It is also sold to consignment shops, dress agencies, flea markets, and in online auctions. Also, used clothing often is collected on an industrial scale to be sorted and shipped for re-use in poorer countries. Globally, used clothes are worth $4 billion, with the U.S. as the leading exporter at $575 million.\nSynthetics, which come primarily from petrochemicals, are not renewable or biodegradable.\nExcess inventory of clothing is sometimes destroyed to preserve brand value.\nGlobal trade.\nEU member states imported \u20ac166 billion of clothes in 2018; 51% came from outside the EU (\u20ac84 billion). EU member states exported \u20ac116 billion of clothes in 2018, including 77% to other EU member states.\nAccording to the World Trade Organization (WTO) report, the value of global clothing exports in 2022 reached US$790.1 billion, up 10.6% from 2021. China is the world's largest clothing exporter, with a value of US$178.4 billion, accounting for 22.6% of the global market share. Next are Bangladesh (US$40.8 billion), Vietnam (US$39.8 billion), India (US$36.1 billion), and Turkey (US$29.7 billion).\nIn Vietnam, clothing exports continue to be one of the leading export sectors, contributing significantly to the export turnover and economic growth of the country. According to the General Department of Customs of Vietnam, the value of Vietnam's clothing exports in 2022 reached US$39.8 billion, up 14.2% from 2021. Of which, clothing exports to the United States reached US$18.8 billion, accounting for 47.3% of the market share; exports to the EU reached US$9.8 billion, accounting for 24.6% of the market share.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Among the SEALs' main functions are conducting small-unit special operation missions in maritime, jungle, urban, arctic, mountainous, and desert environments. SEALs are typically ordered to capture or kill high-level targets, or to gather intelligence behind enemy lines. \nSEAL team personnel are hand-selected, highly trained, and highly proficient in unconventional warfare (UW), direct action (DA), and special reconnaissance (SR), among other tasks like sabotage, demolition, intelligence gathering, and hydrographic reconnaissance, training, and advising friendly militaries or other forces. All active SEALs are members of the U.S. Navy.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nHistory.\nOrigins.\nAlthough not formally founded until 1962, the modern-day U.S. Navy SEALs trace their roots to World War II. The United States Military recognized the need for the covert reconnaissance of landing beaches and coastal defenses. As a result, the joint Army, Marine Corps, and Navy Amphibious Scout and Raider School was established in 1942 at Fort Pierce, Florida. The Scouts and Raiders were formed in September of that year, just nine months after the attack on Pearl Harbor, from the Observer Group, a joint U.S. Army-Marine-Navy unit.\nScouts and Raiders.\nRecognizing the need for a beach reconnaissance force, a select group of Army and Navy personnel assembled at Amphibious Training Base (ATB) Little Creek, Virginia on 15 August 1942 to begin Amphibious Scouts and Raiders (Joint) training. The Scouts and Raiders' mission was to identify and reconnoiter the objective beach, maintain a position on the designated beach prior to a landing, and guide the assault waves to the landing beach. The unit was led by U.S. Army 1st Lieutenant Lloyd Peddicord as commanding officer, and Navy Ensign John Bell as executive officer. Navy Chief Petty Officers and sailors came from the boat pool at U. S. Naval Amphibious Training Base, Solomons, Maryland, and Army Raider personnel came from the 3rd and 9th Infantry Divisions. They trained at Little Creek until embarking for the North Africa campaign the following November. Operation Torch was launched in November 1942 off the Atlantic coast of French Morocco in North Africa.\nThe first group included Phil H. Bucklew, the \"Father of Naval Special Warfare,\" after whom the Naval Special Warfare Center building is named. Commissioned in October 1942, this group saw combat in November 1942 during Operation Torch on the North African Coast. Scouts and Raiders also supported landings in Sicily, Salerno, Anzio, Normandy, and southern France.\nThe second group of Scouts and Raiders, code-named Special Service Unit No. 1, was established on 7 July 1943, as a joint and combined operations force. The first mission, in September 1943, was at Finschhafen in Papua New Guinea. Later operations were at Gasmata, Arawe, Cape Gloucester, and the east and south coasts of New Britain, all without any loss of personnel. Conflicts arose over operational matters, and all non-Navy personnel were reassigned. The unit, renamed 7th Amphibious Scouts, received a new mission, to go ashore with the assault boats, buoy channels, erect markers for the incoming craft, handle casualties, take offshore soundings, clear beach obstacles, and maintain voice communications linking the troops ashore, incoming boats and nearby ships. The 7th Amphibious Scouts conducted operations in the Pacific for the duration of the conflict, participating in more than 40 landings.\nThe third and final Scouts and Raiders organization operated in China. Scouts and Raiders were deployed to fight with the Sino-American Cooperative Organization (SACO). To help bolster the work of SACO, Admiral Ernest J. King ordered that 120 officers and 900 men be trained for \"Amphibious Raider\" at the Scout and Raider school at Fort Pierce, Florida. They formed the core of what was envisioned as a \"guerrilla amphibious organization of Americans and Chinese operating from coastal waters, lakes, and rivers employing small steamboats and sampans.\" While most Amphibious Raider forces remained at Camp Knox in Calcutta, three of the groups saw active service. They conducted a survey of the upper Yangtze River in the spring of 1945 and, disguised as coolies, conducted a detailed three-month survey of the Chinese coast from Shanghai to Kitchioh Wan, near Hong Kong.\nNaval Combat Demolition Units (NCDUs).\nIn September 1942, 17 Navy salvage personnel arrived at ATB Little Creek, Virginia for a week-long course in demolitions, explosive cable cutting, and commando raiding techniques. On 10 November 1942, the first combat demolition unit successfully cut cable and net barriers across the Wadi Sebou River during Operation Torch in North Africa. This enabled to traverse the water and insert U.S. Rangers who captured the Port Lyautey airdrome.\nIn early May 1943, a two-phase \"Naval Demolition Project\" was directed by the Chief of Naval Operations \"to meet a present and urgent requirement\". The first phase began at ATB Solomons, Maryland with the establishment of Operational Naval Demolition Unit No. 1. Six officers and eighteen enlisted men reported from the Seabee's NTC Camp Peary dynamiting and demolition school, for a four-week course. Those Seabees, led by Lieutenant Fred Wise CEC, were immediately sent to participate in the invasion of Sicily. At that time Lieutenant Commander Draper L. Kauffman, \"The Father of Naval Combat Demolition,\" was selected to set up a school for Naval Demolitions and direct the entire Project. The first six classes graduated from \"Area E\" at NTC Camp Peary. LCDR Kauffman's needs quickly out-grew \"Area E\" and on 6 June 1943, he established NCDU training at Fort Pierce. Most of Kauffman's volunteers came from the navy's Civil Engineer Corps (CEC) and enlisted Seabees. Training commenced with a grueling week designed to filter out under-performing candidates. Eventually given the name \"Hell Week\" by NCDU recruits, this rigorous course was integrated into UDT training and remains a part of modern-day Navy Seal training today.\nBy April 1944, a total of 34 NCDUs were deployed to England in preparation for Operation Overlord, the amphibious landing at Normandy. On 6 June 1944, under heavy fire, the NCDUs at Omaha Beach managed to blow eight complete gaps and two partial gaps in the German defenses. The NCDUs suffered 31 killed and 60 wounded, a casualty rate of 52%. Meanwhile, the NCDUs at Utah Beach met less intense enemy fire. They cleared of beach in two hours, another by the afternoon. Casualties at Utah Beach were significantly lighter with six killed and eleven wounded. During Operation Overlord, not a single demolitioneer was lost to improper handling of explosives. In August 1944, four NCDUs from Utah Beach plus nine others participated in the landings Operation Dragoon in southern France. It was the last amphibious operation in the European Theater of Operations. Once the European invasions were complete, Rear Admiral Kelly Turner requisitioned all available NCDUs from Fort Pierce for integration into the Underwater Demolition Teams (UDTs) operating in the Pacific Theater.\nThirty NCDUs had been sent to the Pacific prior to Normandy. NCDUs 1\u201310 were staged on Florida Island in the Solomon Islands (archipelago) during January 1944. NCDU 1 went briefly to the Aleutians in 1943. NCDUs 4 and 5 were the first to see combat by helping the 4th Marines at Green Island and Emirau Island. A few were temporarily attached to UDTs. Later NCDUs 1\u201310 were combined to form Underwater Demolition Team Able. Six NCDUs: 2,3, 19, 20, 21 and 24 served with the Seventh Amphibious Force and were the only remaining NCDUs at the end of the war. The Naval Special Warfare Command building is named for LTJG Frank Kaine CEC commander of NCDU 2.\nUnderwater Demolition Teams (UDTs).\nThe first units designated as Underwater Demolition Teams were formed in the Pacific Theater. Rear Admiral Kelly Turner, the Navy's top amphibious expert, ordered the formation of Underwater Demolition Teams in response to the failed invasion at Tarawa and the Marines' inability to clear the surrounding coral reefs with Landing Vehicle Tracked (LVTS). Turner recognized that amphibious operations required intelligence of underwater obstacles. The personnel for these teams were mostly local Seabees or others that had started out in the NCDUs. UDT training was at the Waipio Amphibious Operating Base, under V Amphibious Corps operational and administrative control. Most of the instructors and trainees were graduates of the Fort Pierce NCDU or Scouts and Raiders schools, Seabees, Marines, and Army soldiers.\nWhen Teams 1 and 2 were initially formed, they were \"provisional\" with 180 men in total. The first underwater demolition team commanders were CDR E.D. Brewster (CEC) UDT 1 and CDR John T. Koehler UDT 2. The teams wore fatigues with life-vests and were not expected to leave their boats\u2014similar to the NCDUs. However, at Kwajalein Fort Pierce protocol was changed. Admiral Turner ordered daylight reconnaissance and CEC. ENS Lewis F. Luehrs and Seabee Chief William Acheson wore swim trunks under their fatigues anticipating they would not be able to get what the Admiral wanted by staying in the boat. They stripped down and spent 45 minutes in the water in broad daylight. When they got out they were taken directly to Admiral Turner's flagship to report, still in their trunks. Admiral Turner concluded that daylight reconnaissance by individual swimmers was the way to get accurate information on coral and underwater obstacles for upcoming landings. This is what he reported to Admiral Nimitz. The success of those UDT 1 Seabees not following Fort Pierce protocol rewrote the UDT mission model and training regimen. Those Seabees also created the image of UDTs as the \"naked warriors\". At Engebi CDR Brewster was wounded and all of the men with ENS Luehrs wore swim trunks under their greens.\nAfter the operations in the Marshall Islands, Admiral Turner restructured the two provisional UDT units and created 7 permanent units with an allotted size of 96 men per team. In the name of operational efficiency, the UDTs were also made an-all Navy outfit, and any Army and Marine Corps engineers were returned to their units. Moving forward, the UDTs would employ the reconnaissance method made successful in Kwajalein \u2013 daytime use of swimsuits and goggles instead of the Scouts and Raiders method of nighttime rubber boats. In order to implement these changes and grow the UDTs, Koehler was made the commanding officer of the Naval Combat Demolition Training and Experimental Base on Maui. Admiral Turner also brought on LCDR Draper Kauffman as a combat officer.\nSeabees made up the vast majority of the men in teams 1\u20139, 13, and 15. Seabees were roughly 20% of UDT 11. The officers were mostly CEC.\nAt war's end 34 teams had been formed with teams 1\u201321 having actually been deployed. The Seabees provided over half of the men in the teams that saw service.\nThe UDT uniform had transitioned from the combat fatigues of the NCDUs to trunks, swimfins, diving masks and Ka-bars. The men trained by the OSS had brought their swimfins with them when they joined the UDTs. They were adopted by the other teams as quickly as Supply could get them.\nThese \"Naked Warriors\", as they came to be called post-war, saw action in every major Pacific amphibious landing including: Eniwetok, Saipan, Kwajalein, Tinian, Guam, Angaur, Ulithi, Peleliu, Leyte, Lingayen Gulf, Zambales, Iwo Jima, Okinawa, Labuan, and Brunei Bay. By fall of 1944, the UDT's were considered an indispensable US military special operations unit, and Navy planners in the Central Pacific relied heavily on the UDT's reconnaissance reports and demolition activities to clear the way for landings.\nThe last UDT operation of the war was on 4 July 1945 at Balikpapan, Borneo. The rapid demobilization at the conclusion of the war reduced the number of active duty UDTs to two on each coast with a complement of seven officers and 45 enlisted men each. However, the UDTs were the only special troops that avoided complete disbandment after the war, unlike the OSS Maritime Unit, the VAC Recon Battalion, and several Marine recon missions.\nBecause they were so integral to the success of missions in the Pacific during the war, the U.S. Navy did not publicize the existence of the UDTs until post-war. During WWII the Navy did not have a rating for the UDTs nor did they have an insignia. Those men with the CB rating on their uniforms considered themselves Seabees that were doing underwater demolition (Fig. 11). They did not call themselves \"UDTs\" or \"Frogmen\" but rather \"Demolitioneers\" which had carried over from the NCDUs and Lt Cdr Kauffman's recruiting efforts from the Seabee dynamiting and demolition school. The next largest group of UDT volunteers came from the joint Army-Navy Scouts and Raiders school that was also in Fort Pierce and the Navy's bomb disposal school in the Seabee-dominated teams.\nFor the Marianas operations of Kwajalein, Roi-Namur, Siapan, Tinian, Eniwetok, and Guam, Admiral Turner recommended sixty Silver Stars and over three hundred Bronze Stars with Vs for the Seabees and other service members of UDTs 1\u20137 That was unprecedented in U.S. Naval/Marine Corps history. For UDTs 5 and 7 every officer received a silver star and all the enlisted received bronze stars with Vs for Operation Forager (Tinian). For UDTs 3 and 4 every officer received a silver star and all the enlisted received bronze stars with Vs for Operation Forager (Guam). Admiral Richard Lansing Conolly felt the commanders of teams 3 and 4 (LT Crist and LT W.G. Carberry) should have received Navy Crosses. As the first to often make amphibious landings, the UDTs began making signs to welcome the Marines, indicating they had been there first, to foster the continued friendly rivalry. In keeping with UDT tradition, UDT 21 created a sign to greet the Marines landing in Japan. For Operation Beleaguer UDT 9 was deployed with the III Amphibious Corps to Northern China. In 1965 the UDT 12 put up another beach sign to greet the Marines at Da Nang.\nOperation Crossroads UDT 3 was designated TU 1.1.3 for the operation. On 27 April 1946, seven officers and 51 enlisted embarked at CBC Port Hueneme, for transit to Bikini. Their assignment was to retrieve water samples from ground zero of the Baker blast.\nKorean War.\nThe Korean War began on 25 June 1950, when the North Korean army invaded South Korea. Beginning with a detachment of 11 personnel from UDT 3, UDT participation expanded to three teams with a combined strength of 300 men. During the \"Forgotten War\" the UDTs fought intensely, employing demolition expertise gained from World War II and using it for an offensive role. Continuing to use water as cover and concealment as well as an insertion method, the Korean Era UDTs targeted bridges, tunnels, fishing nets, and other maritime and coastal targets. They also developed a close working relationship with the Republic of Korea Underwater Demolitions Unit (predecessor to the Navy Special Warfare Flotilla), which continues today.\nThrough their focused efforts on demolitions and mine disposal, the UDTs refined and developed their commando tactics during the Korean War. The UDTs also accompanied South Korean commandos on raids in the North to demolish train tunnels. This was frowned upon by higher-ranking officials because they believed it was a non-traditional use of Naval forces. Due to the nature of the war, the UDTs maintained a low operational profile. Some of the missions included transporting spies into North Korea and the destruction of North Korean fishing nets used to supply the North Korean Army.\nAs part of the Special Operations Group, or SOG, UDTs successfully conducted demolition raids on railroad tunnels and bridges along the Korean coast. The UDTs specialized in a somewhat new mission: Night coastal demolition raids against railroad tunnels and bridges. The UDT men were given the task because, in the words of UDT LT Ted Fielding, \"We were ready to do what nobody else could do, and what nobody else wanted to do.\" (Ted Fielding was awarded the Silver Star during Korea, and was later promoted to the rank of Captain.)\nOn 15 September 1950, UDTs supported Operation Chromite, the amphibious landing at Incheon. UDT 1 and 3 provided personnel who went in ahead of the landing craft, scouting mud flats, marking low points in the channel, clearing fouled propellers, and searching for mines. Four UDT personnel acted as wave-guides for the Marine landing. In October 1950, UDTs supported mine-clearing operations in Wonsan Harbor where frogmen would locate and mark mines for minesweepers. On 12 October 1950, two U.S.minesweepers hit mines and sank. UDTs rescued 25 sailors. The next day, William Giannotti conducted the first U.S. combat operation using an \"aqualung\" when he dived on . For the remainder of the war, UDTs conducted beach and river reconnaissance, infiltrated guerrillas behind the lines from sea, continued mine sweeping operations and participated in Operation Fishnet, which devastated the North Koreans' fishing capability.\nBirth of Navy SEALs and the Vietnam War.\nPresident John F. Kennedy, aware of the situation in Southeast Asia, recognized the need for unconventional warfare and special operations as a measure against guerrilla warfare. In a speech to Congress on 25 May 1961, Kennedy spoke of his deep respect for the United States Army Special Forces. While his announcement of the government's plan to put a man on the moon drew most of the attention, in the same speech he announced his intention to spend over $100 million to strengthen U.S. special operations forces and expand American capabilities in unconventional warfare. Some people erroneously credit President Kennedy with creating the Navy SEALs. His announcement was actually only a formal acknowledgement of a process that had been underway since the Korean War.\nThe Navy needed to determine its role within the special operations arena. In March 1961, Admiral Arleigh Burke, the Chief of Naval Operations, recommended the establishment of guerrilla and counter-guerrilla units. These units would be able to operate from sea, air or land. This was the beginning of the Navy SEALs. All SEALs came from the Navy's Underwater Demolition Teams, who had already gained extensive experience in commando warfare in Korea; however, the Underwater Demolition Teams were still necessary to the Navy's amphibious force.\nThe first two teams were formed in January 1962 and stationed on both US coasts: Team One at Naval Amphibious Base Coronado, in San Diego, California and Team Two at Naval Amphibious Base Little Creek, in Virginia Beach, Virginia. Formed entirely with personnel from UDTs, the SEALs mission was to conduct counter guerilla warfare and clandestine operations in maritime and riverine environments. Men of the newly formed SEAL Teams were trained in such unconventional areas as hand-to-hand combat, high-altitude parachuting, demolitions, and foreign languages. The SEALs attended Underwater Demolition Team replacement training and they spent some time training in UDTs. Upon making it to a SEAL team, they would undergo a SEAL Basic Indoctrination (SBI) training class at Camp Kerry in the Cuyamaca Mountains. After SBI training class, they would enter a platoon and conduct platoon training.\nAccording to founding SEAL team member Roy Boehm, the SEALs' first missions were directed against communist Cuba. These consisted of deploying from submarines and carrying out beach reconnaissance in a prelude to a proposed US amphibious invasion of the island. On at least one occasion, Boehm and another SEAL had smuggled a CIA agent ashore to take pictures of Soviet nuclear missiles being unloaded on the dockside.\nThe Pacific Command recognized Vietnam as a potential hot spot for unconventional forces. At the beginning of 1962, the UDTs started hydrographic surveys and along with other branches of the US Military, the Military Assistance Command Vietnam (MACV) was formed. In March 1962, SEALs were deployed to South Vietnam as advisors for the purpose of training Army of the Republic of Vietnam commandos in the same methods they were trained themselves.\nThe Central Intelligence Agency began using SEALs in covert operations in early 1963. The SEALs were later involved in the CIA sponsored Phoenix Program where it targeted Vietcong (VC) infrastructure and personnel for capture and assassination.\nThe SEALs were initially deployed in and around Da Nang, training the South Vietnamese in combat diving, demolitions and guerrilla/anti-guerrilla tactics. As the war continued, the SEALs found themselves positioned in the Rung Sat Special Zone where they were to disrupt the enemy supply and troop movements and in the Mekong Delta to fulfill riverine operations, fighting on the inland waterways.\nCombat with the VC was direct. Unlike the conventional warfare methods of firing artillery into a coordinate location, the SEALs operated close to their targets. Into the late 1960s, the SEALs were successful in a new style of warfare, effective in anti-guerrilla and guerrilla actions. SEALs brought a personal war to the enemy in a previously safe area. The VC referred to them as \"the men with green faces,\" due to the camouflage face paint the SEALs wore during combat missions.\nIn February 1966, a small SEAL Team One detachment arrived in South Vietnam to conduct direct action missions. Operating from Nh\u00e0 B\u00e8 Base, near the Rung Sat Special Zone, this detachment signalled the beginning of a SEAL presence that would eventually include 8 SEAL platoons in country on a continuing basis. SEALs also served as advisors for Provincial Reconnaissance Units and the Lein Doc Nguio Nhia, the Vietnamese SEALs.\nSEALs continued to make forays into North Vietnam and Laos and covertly into Cambodia, controlled by the Studies and Observations Group. The SEALs from Team Two started a unique deployment of SEAL team members working alone with ARVN Commandos. In 1967, a SEAL unit named Detachment Bravo (Det Bravo) was formed to operate these mixed US and ARVN units.\nBy 1970, President Richard Nixon initiated a plan of Vietnamization, which would remove the US from the Vietnam War and return the responsibility of defense back to the South Vietnamese. Conventional forces were being withdrawn; the last SEAL platoon left South Vietnam on 7 December 1971, and the last SEAL advisor left South Vietnam in March 1973. The SEALs were among the most highly decorated units for their size in the war, receiving by 1974 one Medal of Honor, two Navy Crosses, 42 Silver stars, 402 Bronze Stars, two Legions of Merit, 352 Commendation Medals, and 51 Navy Achievement Medals Later awards would bring the total to three Medals of Honor and five Navy Crosses. SEAL Team One was awarded three Presidential Unit Citations and one Navy Unit Commendation; SEAL Team Two received two Presidential Unit Citations. By the end of the war, 48 SEALs had been killed in Vietnam, but estimates of their kill count are as high as 2,000. The Navy SEAL Museum in Fort Pierce, Florida, displays a list of the 48 SEALs who lost their lives in combat during the Vietnam War.\nReorganization.\nIn 1974\u20131975, UDT-13 was redesignated; some personnel established Underwater Construction Teams, and while others joined special boat detachments. On 1 May 1983, UDT\u201311 was redesignated as SEAL Team Five, UDT\u201321 was redesignated as SEAL Team Four, UDT\u201312 became SEAL Delivery Vehicle Team One (SDVT\u20131), and UDT\u201322 was redesignated as SDVT-2. SEAL Team Three, was established 1 October 1983 in Coronado, California. United States Special Operations Command (SOCOM) was established in April 1987 and its Naval component, United States Naval Special Warfare Command (NAVSPECWARCOM), also known as NSWC, was established at the same time.\nGrenada.\nBoth SEAL Team Four and SEAL Team Six, the predecessor to DEVGRU, participated in the US invasion of Grenada. The SEALs' two primary missions were the extraction of Grenada's Governor-General, Sir Paul Scoon, and the capture of Grenada's only radio tower. Neither mission was well briefed or sufficiently supported with timely intelligence and the SEALs ran into trouble from the very beginning. On 24 October 1983, twelve operators from SEAL Team Six and four Air Force Combat Control Team members (CCT) conducted a predawn combat airborne water insertion from C-130 Hercules aircraft with Zodiac inflatable rubber boats 40 kilometers north of Point Salines, Grenada. The team inserted with full combat gear in bad weather with low visibility conditions and high winds. Four SEALs drowned and were never recovered. SEALs split into two teams and proceeded to their objectives. After digging in at the Governor's mansion, the SEALs realized they had forgotten to load their cryptographic satellite phone. As Grenadian and Cuban troops surrounded the team, the SEALs' only radio ran out of battery power, and they used the mansion's land line telephone to call in AC-130 gunship fire support. The SEALs were pinned down in the mansion overnight and were relieved and extracted by a group of Marines the following morning.\nThe team sent to the radio station also ran into communication problems. As soon as the SEALs reached the radio facility they found themselves unable to raise their command post. After beating back several waves of Grenadian and Cuban troops supported by BTR-60 armored personnel carriers, the SEALs decided that their position at the radio tower was untenable. They destroyed the station and fought their way to the water where they hid from patrolling enemy forces. After the enemy had given up their search, the SEALs, some wounded, swam into the open sea where they were extracted several hours later after being spotted by a reconnaissance aircraft.\nIran\u2013Iraq War.\nDuring the closing stages of the Iran\u2013Iraq War the United States Navy began conducting operations in the Persian Gulf to protect US-flagged ships from attack by Iranian naval forces. A secret plan was put in place and dubbed Operation Prime Chance. Navy SEAL Teams 1 and 2 along with several Special Boat Units and EOD technicians were deployed on mobile command barges and transported by helicopters from the Army's 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment. Over the course of the operation SEALs conducted VBSS (visit, board, search, and seizure) missions to counter Iranian mine-laying boats. The only loss of life occurred during the takedown of the \"Iran Ajr\". Evidence gathered on the \"Iran Ajr\" by the SEALs later allowed the US Navy to trace the mines that struck . This chain of events led to Operation Praying Mantis, the largest US Naval surface engagement since the Second World War.\nDuring Operation Desert Shield and Storm, Navy SEALs trained Kuwaiti Special Forces. They set up naval special operations groups in Kuwait, working with the Kuwaiti Navy in exile. Using these new diving, swimming, and combat skills, these commandos took part in combat operations such as the liberation of the capital city.\nPanama.\nThe United States Navy contributed extensive special operations assets to Panama's invasion, codenamed Operation Just Cause. This included SEAL Teams 2 and 4, Naval Special Warfare Unit 8, and Special Boat Unit 26, all falling under Naval Special Warfare Group 2; and the separate Naval Special Warfare Development Group (DEVGRU). DEVGRU fell under Task Force Blue, while Naval Special Warfare Group 2 composed the entirety of Task Force White. Task Force White was tasked with three principal objectives: the destruction of Panamanian Defense Forces (PDF) naval assets in Balboa Harbor and the destruction of Manuel Noriega's private jet at Paitilla Airport (collectively known as Operation Nifty Package), as well as isolating PDF forces on Flamenco Island.\nThe strike on Balboa Harbor by Task Unit Whiskey is notably marked in SEAL history as the first publicly acknowledged combat swimmer mission since the Second World War. Prior to the commencement of the invasion four Navy SEALs swam underwater into the harbor on Draeger LAR-V rebreathers and attached C-4 explosives to and destroyed Noriega's personal gunboat the \"Presidente Porras\".\nTask Unit Papa was tasked with the seizure of Paitilla airfield and the destruction of Noriega's plane there. Several SEALs were concerned about the nature of the mission assigned to them being that airfield seizure was usually the domain of the Army Rangers. Despite these misgivings and a loss of operational surprise, the SEALs of TU Papa proceeded with their mission. Almost immediately upon landing, the 48 SEALs came under withering fire from the PDF stationed at the airfield. Although Noriega's plane was eventually destroyed, the SEALs suffered four dead, including Chief Petty Officer Donald McFaul, and thirteen wounded.\nPersian Gulf War.\nIn August 1990, SEALs were the first western forces to deploy to the Persian Gulf as part of Operation Desert Shield. They infiltrated Kuwait the capital city within hours of the invasion and gathered intelligence and developed plans to rescue US embassy staff should they become hostages. SEALs were also the first to capture Iraqi Prisoners of War when they assaulted nine Kuwaiti Oil platforms on 19 January 1991. On 23 February 1991, a seven-man SEAL team launched a mission to trick the Iraqi military into thinking an amphibious assault on Kuwait by coalition forces was imminent by setting off explosives and placing marking buoys 500 meters off the Kuwaiti coast. The mission was a success and Iraqi forces were diverted east away from the true coalition offensive. The SEALs were first into Kuwait City in their Desert Patrol Vehicles when it was recaptured.\nSomalia Intervention.\nOn 6 December 1992, as part of Operation Restore Hope, U.S. Navy SEALs and Special Boat crewmen from Naval Special Warfare Task Unit TRIPOLI began a three-day operation carrying out reconnaissance operations in the vicinity of Mogadishu airport and harbor; ahead of UNITAFs deployment to the country. They suffered only one casualty, who was injured by an IED.\nIn August 1993 a four-person DEVGRU SEAL sniper team was deployed to Mogadishu to work alongside Delta Force as part of Task Force Ranger in the search for Somali warlord Mohammed Farrah Aidid. They took part in several operations in support of the CIA and Army culminating in the 3 October 'Battle of Mogadishu' where they were part of the ground convoy raiding the Olympic Hotel. All four SEALs would be later awarded the Silver Star in recognition of their bravery while Navy SEAL Howard E. Wasdin would be awarded a Purple Heart after continuing to fight despite being wounded three times during the battle.\nWar in Afghanistan.\nInvasion.\nIn the immediate aftermath of the September 11 attacks, Navy SEALs quickly dispatched to Camp Doha, and those already aboard U.S. Naval vessels in the Persian Gulf and surrounding waters began conducting VBSS operations against ships suspected of having ties to or even carrying al Qaeda operatives. SEAL Teams 3 and 8 also began rotating into Oman from the United States and staging on the island of Masirah for operations in Afghanistan. One of the SEALs' immediate concerns was their lack of suitable vehicles to conduct special reconnaissance (SR) missions in the rough, landlocked terrain of Afghanistan. After borrowing and retrofitting Humvees from the Army Rangers also staging on Masirah, the SEALs entered Afghanistan to conduct the SR of what would become Camp Rhino, as part of Operation Enduring Freedom \u2013 Afghanistan (OEF-A). These early stages of OEF were commanded by a fellow SEAL, Rear Admiral Albert Calland.\nAs part of the CJSOTF (Combined Joint Special Operations Task Force) under the command of General Tommy Franks at CENTCOM, SEALs from DEVGRU were part of Task Force Sword, which was established in early October 2001. It was a black SOF (Special Operations Forces) unit under direct command of JSOC. It was a so-called hunter-killer force whose primary objective was to capture or kill senior leadership and HVT within both al-Qaeda and the Taliban. Sword was initially structured around a two-squadron component of operators from Delta Force (Task Force Green) and DEVGRU (Task Force Blue) supported by a Ranger protection force team (Task Force Red), ISA signals intercept and surveillance operators (Task Force Orange) and the 160th SOAR (Task Force Brown). Task Force K-Bar was established on 10 October 2001, it was formed around a Naval Special Warfare Group consisting of SEALs from SEAL Teams 2, 3 and 8 and Green Berets from 1st Battalion, 3rd SFG; the task force was led by SEAL Captain Robert Harward.\nThe task force's principal task was to conduct SR and SSE missions in the south of the country. Other Coalition SOF-particularly KSK, JTF2 and New Zealand Special Air Service were assigned to the task force. As part of the JIATF-CT (Joint Interagency Task Force-Counterterrorism)\u2014intelligence integration and fusion activity composed of personnel from all of Operation Enduring Freedom \u2013 Afghanistan-participating units\u2014SEALs from DEVGRU were part of Task Force Bowie, they were embedded in the task force in AFOs (Advanced Force Operations). The AFOs were 45-man reconnaissances units made up of Delta Force recce specialists augmented by selected SEALs from DEVGRU and supported by ISA's technical experts. The AFOs had been raised to support TF Sword and were tasked with intelligence preparation of the battlefield, working closely with the CIA and reported directly to Task Force Sword. The AFOs conducted covert reconnaissance\u2014sending small two or three-man teams into al-Qaeda 'Backyard' along the border with Pakistan, the AFO operators would deploy observation posts to watch and report enemy movements and numbers as well as environmental reconnaissance; much of the work was done on foot or ATVs.\nSEALs were present at the Battle of Qala-i-Jangi in November 2001 alongside their counterparts from the British SBS. Chief Petty Officer Stephen Bass was awarded the Navy Cross for his actions during the battle.\nBefore the US Marines landed at Camp Rhino in November 2001, a SEAL recce team from SEAL Team 8 conducted reconnaissance of the area, they were mistakenly engaged by orbiting AH-1W attack helicopters, but the SEALs managed to get a message through to the Marines before they suffered casualties. The SR mission in the region of Camp Rhino lasted for four days, after which two United States Air Force Combat Control Teams made a nighttime HALO jump to assist the SEALs in guiding in Marines from the 15th Marine Expeditionary Unit who seized control of the area and established a forward operating base.\nPost-invasion.\nIn January 2002, following the Battle of Tora Bora, another series of caves was discovered in Zhawar Kili, just south of Tora Bora; airstrikes hit the sites before SOF teams were inserted into the area. A SEAL platoon from SEAL Team 3, including several of their Desert Patrol Vehicles, accompanied by a German KSK element, a Norwegian SOF team and JTF2 reconnaissance teams spent some nine days conducting extensive SSE, clearing an estimated 70 caves and 60 structures in the area, recovering a huge amount of both intelligence and munitions, but they didn't encounter any al-Qaeda fighters. Subsequent SEAL operations during the invasion of Afghanistan were conducted within Task Force K-Bar, a joint special operations unit of Army Special Forces, United States Air Force Special Tactics Teams, and special operations forces from Norway, Germany, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, and Denmark. Task Force K-Bar conducted combat operations in the massive cave complexes near the city of Kandahar and surrounding territory, the town of Prata Ghar and hundreds of miles of rough terrain in southern and eastern Afghanistan. Over the course of six months, Task Force K-Bar killed or captured over 200 Taliban and al Qaeda fighters and destroyed tens of thousands of pounds of weapons and ordnance.\nIn February 2002, while at Camp Rhino, the CIA passed on intelligence from a Predator drone operating in the Paktia province that Taliban Mullah Khirullah Said Wali Khairkhwa was spotted leaving a building by vehicle convoy. SEALs and Danish J\u00e6gerkorpset commandos boarded Air Force Pave Low helicopters and seized Khairkhwa on the road less than two hours later. The SEALs continued to perform reconnaissance operations for the Marines until leaving after having spent 45 days on the ground.\nIn March 2002, SEALs from DEVGRU, SEAL Teams 2, 3 and 8 participated extensively in Operation Anaconda. During what would become known as the Battle of Takur Ghar, whilst inserting from an MH-47E Chinook, PO1 Neil Roberts from DEVGRU, was thrown from his helicopter when it took fire from entrenched al Qaeda fighters. Roberts was subsequently killed after engaging and fighting dozens of enemies for almost an hour. Several SEALs were wounded in a rescue attempt and their Air Force Combat Controller, Technical Sergeant John Chapman, was killed. Attempts to rescue the stranded SEAL also led to the deaths of several US Army Rangers and an Air Force Pararescueman acting as a Quick Reaction Force.\nLater in 2002, CJSOFT became a single integrated command under the broader CJTF-180 that commanded all US forces assigned to OEF-A, it was built around an Army Special Forces Group (composed of soldiers from National Guard units) and SEAL teams. A small JSOC element (formerly Task Force Sword/11) not under direct CTJF command\u2014embedded within CJSOFT, it consisted of a joint SEAL and Ranger element that rotated command, and was not under direct ISAF command, although it operated in support of NATO operations.\nIn June 2005, Lieutenant Michael P. Murphy was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor after his four-man reconnaissance counterinsurgency team was almost wiped out during Operation Red Wings. After the four-man team lost Danny Dietz, he put himself in open view to call in the QRF. He soon after died from injuries sustained. Matthew Axelson also died on this operation. The QRF never reached the scene; it was struck by an RPG killing eight Navy SEALs and eight Army Night Stalkers. Marcus Luttrell was the only survivor from this operation.\nIn early 2010, Brigadier General Scott Miller took command of CJSOTF-Afghanistan and assigned virtually all SOF in the theatre to a new counterinsurgency role that would become known as the ALP/VSO Program (Afghan Local Police/Village Stability Operations), the SOF in Afghanistan were organized into battalion level SOTF (Special Operations Task Forces) each with a geographic area of responsibility-the SEALs were given southeast Afghanistan. To increase security of their assigned VSO village, a SEAL Platoon in Chora District, Uruzgan Province built a wall constructed of of HESCO barriers to divert insurgent movements away, this proved successful and eventually the Afghan villagers took ownership of it. SEALs and other SOTF still conducted Direct Action missions, but now partnered with Afghan forces.\nOn 6 August 2011, seventeen U.S. Navy SEALs were killed when their CH-47 Chinook helicopter was shot down by an RPG fired by Taliban militants. The SEALs were en route to support U.S. Army Rangers who were taking fire while attempting to capture a senior Taliban leader in the Tangi Valley. Fifteen of the SEALs belonged to the Naval Special Warfare Development Group. Two others were SEALs assigned to a West Coast-based Naval Special Warfare unit. A total of 30 Americans and eight Afghans were killed in the crash, making it the single largest loss of U.S. lives in the Global War on Terrorism.\nOn 16 August 2012, SEALs in Uruzgan Province conducted a joint operation into the Shah Wali Kot Valley where they suffered the loss of a Black Hawk helicopter when it was struck by an insurgent RPG, the crash killed 11 servicemen (seven US and four Afghan).\nIn December 2012, SEALs from DEVGRU rescued a US doctor who had been kidnapped a few days earlier. However, during the operation the unit suffered a fatality, Petty Officer 1st Class Nicolas D. Checque. Senior Chief Edward Byers, was awarded the Medal of Honor for his actions during this mission.\nIn May 2013, Rear Admiral Sean Pybus, commander of Navy Special Warfare stated that the unit would cut in half the number of SEAL platoons in Afghanistan by the end of 2013. Pybus also added that the unit is already \"undergoing a transition back to its maritime roots\" by placing more emphasis on sea-based missions after being involved in mostly landlocked missions since 2001.\nIraq War.\nInvasion.\nFor the 2003 invasion of Iraq, a squadron from DEVGRU operated as part of Task Force 20. Their role was to conduct heliborne direct action raids, particularly against HVTs. The Naval Special Operations Task Group was assigned to Operation Iraqi Freedom, and was built around a core of SEAL Teams 8 and 10, Polish GROM, Royal Marines from 40 and 42 Commando under the command of 3 Commando Brigade and attached US Psy Ops and civil affairs teams. The Naval Task Group was principally tasked with the capture of the port of Umm Qasr, Iraq's only deep-water port; the oil pipeline facilities of the Al-Faw Peninsula; and the two off-shore platforms the pipelines fed. Once these initial target sets were secured, the Task Group would support conventional forces in the south, conducting reconnaissance and raiding activities. Aviation support was provided by both Marine air of the 15th MEU and 20th Special Operations Squadron.\nSeveral days before the beginning of the invasion, two SDV teams were launched from Mark V Special Operations Craft in the Persian Gulf. Their objectives were the hydrographic reconnaissance of the Al Basrah (MABOT) and Khawr Al Amaya (KAAOT) Oil Terminals. After swimming under the terminals and securing their Mark 8 mod 1s, the SDV SEALs spent several hours taking pictures and surveying Iraqi activity on both platforms before returning to their boats. On 20 March 2003, SEALs from SEAL Team 8 and 10 (31 SEALs, 2 Navy EOD a USAF combat controller and several Iraqi interpreters) moved to seize the MABOT oil terminal whilst GROM operators assaulted the KAAOT Oil Terminals. The terminals were quickly seized with no casualties, and explosives which were found on the terminals were made safe by GROM operators.\nThe shore-based pumping stations (known as MMS-Monitoring and Meter Stations) and their pipelines on the Al-Faw Peninsula were seized by 12 SEALS from SEAL Team 3, who were mounted in DPVs. They took off from Kuwait and were inserted under Iraqi anti-aircraft fire by MH-53 helicopters. The target area was 'softened up' by JDAM bombs dropped from B-52s on Iraqi bunkers, trenches and dugouts around the oil facilities. After a brief firefight in which the SEALs killed 1 Iraqi soldier and captured 13, the SEALs secured the MMS and the pipelines and were relieved by Royal Marines from 40 Commando. The SEALs advised the Marines, helping coordinate AC-130 Spectres fire support onto Iraqi forces. The other shore-based pumping station at Umm Qasr was secured by SEALs and Royal Marines; before they landed, AC-130 Spectres and A-10As engaged a nearby SAM installation and a responding Iraqi mechanized unit. The SEALs secured the facility itself whilst the Royal Marines cleared Iraqi bunkers, killing several Iraqi soldiers.\nOther Naval Task Group operations included elements of three SEAL platoons in GMV trucks and DPVs seizing the al Zubayr MMS, whilst I MEF attacked the Rumaylah Oil Fields north of al-Faw. SEALs and Special Boat teams helped secure the Khawr Abd Allah and Khawr Az Zubyar waterways, which enabled humanitarian supplies to be delivered to the port of Umm Qasr. SEALs from the unit that secured the al-Faw MMS also conducted reconnaissance on the Shat Al Arab waterway, which was later secured by British forces. SEALs were also involved in various VBSS missions with British and Australian forces to seize Iraqi craft carrying seaborne mines.\nCoalition military planners were concerned that retreating Iraqi forces would destroy the Mukatayin hydroelectric dam, located 57 miles northeast of Baghdad, in an attempt to slow advancing US troops. In addition to restricting the manoeuvre of Coalition forces, the destruction of the dam would deny critical power needs to the surrounding area, as well as cause massive flooding and loss of Iraqi civilian life. A mixed team of SEALs from SEAL Team 5 and Polish GROM was called in to seize the dam. This force was flown several hours by six US Air Force MH-53J Pave Lows; the force consisted of 20 SEALs (with an extra six SEAL snipers in one helicopter carrying the SEAL command and control element) and two EOD operators along with 35 GROM operators to the dam. The SEALs employed DPVs into blocking positions to defend against counterattack and roving bands of Iranian bandits that had been crossing the border and raiding Iraqi towns. As in Al Faw, the SEALs found their DPVs (the SEAL unit at the al-Faw MMS lost all but two DPVs when they were bogged down in the oily mud) to be ineffective, and this marked the last time they would employ them in Iraq. The SEALs and GROM on foot fast-roped out of their helicopters and immediately stormed the dam. The minimal Iraqi troops guarding the dam surrendered without a fight, and with the exception of a GROM soldier who broke an ankle during the insertion, no casualties were sustained in the operation. After several hours of searching the dam for remaining hostile forces or any explosives, the SEALs secured the dam and held it for five days until they were relieved by advancing elements of the US Army.\nDuring the Battle of Basra, SEALs along with the Brigade Reconnaissance Force and 539 Assault Squadron RM attempted a waterborne approach to Basra via the Shatt al-Arab waterway but were intercepted by Iranian Revolutionary Guard patrol craft and did not want to engage them so they withdrew. On 6 April 2003, after relocating further up the waterway they successfully infiltrated via the waterway, using SEAL UAVs they called in \"show-of-force\" and an airstrike by a USMC Harrier on Iraqi troops, the SEALs then headed to \"Chemical Ali's\" house with SSE teams to find traces of chemical weapons. SEALs carried out missions around Nasiriyah, carrying out reconnaissance on surrounding villages and engaging enemy strong points bypassed by the US Marine advance. Charlie Platoon, SEAL Team 3, later operated ahead of the Marine advance carrying out similar missions. SEAL and GROM units continued to cooperate throughout the rest of the invasion phase, with raids and anti-sniper missions in Baghdad.\nPost-invasion Iraq.\nFollowing the invasion, SEAL platoons rotated through Iraq, conducting overwatch for US and Iraqi patrols and directly mentoring local Iraqi forces; they also conducted surveillance and sniping missions into known trouble spots. In September 2004, a SEAL sniper element was tasked with establishing an overwatch and surveillance position overlooking Haifa Street, they were inserted by Bradley IFVs from a unit of the 9th Cavalry Regiment, however they were spotted and engaged by insurgents. The SEALs notified the Bradleys, they drove back, fired on the insurgents and set up a cordon for the SEALs to be extracted, one Bradley was destroyed by a car bomb, there were no casualties, and the SEALs were extracted.\nIn the interim between the First Battle of Fallujah and Second Battle of Fallujah, insurgents in Fallujah knew that the coalition assault was inevitable and under the guidance of the influx of foreign fighters, began to build defensive networks throughout the city-ranging from fortified buildings, trench lines, berms, strategically placed car bombs and IEDs. In preparations for the second battle, SEALs conducted reconnaissance near the berms and tested out reports that the insurgents were equipped with night-vision equipment, they proved this by throwing an infrared chemical light into the street which drew small arms fire. SEALs along with the 5th SFG, Marine Force Recon and Det One and other JSOC elements were heavily involved in shaping operations prior to 7 November D-DAY when coalition forces entered the city. The SOF shaping included sophisticated feints to mislead the insurgents as to the direction of the final assault, close target reconnaissance and direct-action missions where a logistics node or IED factory was targeted. When the offensive on the insurgents in the city began, many of the US Marine companies had SEAL sniper teams attached to them, mainly from SEAL Teams 3, 5 and 10.\nFrom 2005, SEALs were heavily committed to western Iraq in Al Anbar Governorate, AQI terrorists who escaped Fallujah had relocated to Ramadi. A SEAL Task Unit was co-located with the Marines at Al Asad Airbase and sent elements to Ramadi and Habbaniyah, the SEALs were initially tasked with target development for the Marines and providing sniper overwatch for their patrols. The SEALs were already training an Iraqi Army unit in Habbaniyah, although FID was their main focus until later that year. A SEAL Task Unit generally comprised two individual SEAL Platoons: each Platoon was made up of seven-man squad elements commanded by a junior officer, three of these Task Units (although a fourth was often added) along with a Special Boat Team detachment and a Headquarters Team (including integral intelligence, targeting and EOD personnel) made up a Naval Special Warfare Squadron. According to Dick Couch, the SEALs began FID with two Iraqi units-the Army Scouts who conducted conventional reconnaissance missions, and the SMP (Special Missions Platoon), a locally formed unit that would later fight alongside the SEALs. Despite several challenges, the SEALs were soon conducted operations with partnered units, particularly in Special Reconnaissance, focusing on the surveillance aspect, whilst conventional US Army or Marines would conduct raids and arrests. The typical loadout of the SEALs in Ramadi included the M4 carbine, optimized for close quarter battle with a 10-inch barrel equipped with a 6-inch sound suppressor, Surefire flashlight and EOTech sight, short barrel and foregrip and seven magazines.\nAs the SEALs were beginning to make headway in Ramadi, AQI was starting to infiltrate the area by targeting local Sheikhs and convincing them to allow jihadists to marry into local tribes, thus cementing their powerbase and Sheikhs that resisted these advances were met with typical AQI brutality. Al-Qaeda's efforts to install a Sharia-style shadow government in Ramadi led to AQI's downfall-when in the first half of 2006, in the run-up to the Second Battle of Ramadi SEALs, increasingly partnered with conventional forces of the 1st Brigade Combat Team, 1st Armored Division which was planning the offensive. SEALs along with the Scouts and SMP, would conduct reconnaissance, surveillance and sniper overwatch tasks; with their own targeting cell, they also began conducting raids on local insurgent leaders. The 1st BCT began the concerted offensive to clear Ramadi of AQI fighters; on 29 September 2006, whilst at a rooftop overwatch position, Petty Officer Michael A. Monsoor died after leaping upon an enemy grenade during a rooftop firefight, two SEALs on the roof were badly wounded from the grenade fragments and their local Iraqi Scouts ran back into the cover of the building, a fourth SEAL (only lightly wounded), managed to radio his colleagues and get the Scouts to return fire. A SEAL element in a second overwatch position immediately ran through heavy fire to reach Monsoor (whom later died from his wounds in the back of a Bradley IFV) and the wounded SEALs, Monsoor was later awarded the Medal of Honor and the Silver Star. The advances by conventional forces and the SEALs in Ramadi, combined with the brutal tactics of AQI, helped to increase recruitment in a local police initiative-the programme was designed to bring the local Sheikhs' militias into the Iraqi Security Forces. These volunteers would serve locally in their communities to defend them against al-Qaeda, a month after the kidnapping and murder of Sheikh Khalid by AQI (which proved to be the tipping point), the Sheikhs signed a declaration agreeing to fight AQI and by the closing of 2006, even former insurgents were joining the local police (later known as the Anbar Awakening) by the end of the battle, some 1,100 terrorists were killed.\nIn Fallujah, the SEAL Task Unit were also heavily involved in fighting. In one joint operation to capture an AQI leader, they entered the target building and were engaged resulting in an Iraqi Scout being killed and a SEAL severely wounded, two SEALs returned fire and entered the building, both SEALs entered different rooms, in one room the SEAL encountered three insurgents who opened fired at close range, another SEAL across the hallway was struck in the head and killed, the SEAL in the room with the insurgents killed all three.\nIn September 2009, in a nighttime raid in Fallujah, SEALs captured Ahmad Hashim Abd al-Isawi (nicknamed the \"Butcher of Fallujah\"), a prominent al-Qaeda terrorist who was the mastermind behind the 2004 Fallujah ambush. Al-Isawai made accusations of mistreatment while in custody, and testified in April 2010 at the ensuing courts-martial against three SEALs (all of whom were acquitted). Iraqi authorities later tried and executed al-Isawi by hanging at some point before November 2013.\nSEALs remained employed throughout the Iraqi Campaign as Task Units or Task Elements until its close in 2011.\nOperation Enduring Freedom \u2013 Philippines.\nOEF-P was established in 2002 to conduct long-term partnered operations with both Philippine Army special operations and intelligence units, as well as police units, to counter the threat posed by the ASG and JI terrorist groups. Much of this work has been assigned to 1st SFG; SEALs and USAF Special Operations who have also had a long-term presence in the Philippines. There are few confirmed operational details about the SEALs and Green Berets conducting partnered operations, although elements are partnered with Philippine Army and SOF; there have been mentions of Green Berets and SEALs wounded. On 21 June 2002, SEALs in RIBs supported the Philippine Naval Special Operations Group in the operation that killed Abu Sabaya, a senior leader in the ASG. A US Predator UAV marked the HVT with an infrared laser as he tried to escape in a smugglers boat; the MH-47Es from the 160th SOAR used search lights mounted on their helicopters to pinpoint the target's boat while operators from the Philippine Naval Special Operations Group opened fire on the boat killing the terrorist leader and capturing four other terrorists with him.\nOperation Enduring Freedom \u2013 Horn of Africa.\nAs part of OEF-HOA, Naval Special Warfare Unit 10 are deployed to Camp Lemonnier, Djibouti, under the command of SOCCE-HOA (Special Operations Command and Control Element-Horn of Africa) which commands all SOCOM units assigned to training or operational missions in the region. Special operations carried out in Somalia are conducted under the codename: Operation Octave Dune, as part of the overall effort in Somalia, which is known as Operation Octave Shield.\nBefore Djibouti became the epicentre for counter terrorism operations in Africa, unilateral operations were launched from temporary forward locations in friendly nations such as Kenya, or from US Navy ships. The earliest known operation in Somalia was known as Operation Cobalt Blue: In 2003, SEALs using SEAL Delivery Vehicles swam ashore along the Somali coastline and emplaced covert surveillance cameras. Known as cardinals, the cameras were designed to watch likely target locations for wanted terrorists as al-Qaeda and its affiliates began to regroup in the country, however the cameras only took one image a day and captured very little.\nCJSOTF-HOA (Combined Joint Special Operations Task Force-Horn of Africa) developed a rescue plan called Operation Mystic Talon, in case any CIA SAD or ISA operators were captured in the region, the plan required a SEAL platoon with Air Force Special Operations assets that, if necessary, would fight their way into Somalia, recover the hostage and fight their way out, should a mission need to be launched before a dedicated JSOC task force could be deployed to the region.\n\"Maersk Alabama\" hijacking.\nOn 12 April 2009, in response to a hostage taking incident off the coast of Somalia by Somalian pirates, three Navy SEALs from DEVGRU simultaneously engaged and killed the three pirates who were closely holding the hostage, Captain Richard Phillips, of the freighter ship . The pirates and their hostage were being towed in a lifeboat approximately 100 yards behind when each of the pirates were killed by a different DEVGRU sniper with a single shot to the head.\nDeath of Osama bin Laden.\nIn the early morning of 2 May 2011 local time, a team of Navy SEALs of the Naval Special Warfare Development Group (DEVGRU), previously called \"SEAL Team 6\", along with a Belgian Malinois Military Working Dog (named \"Cairo\"), supported by Special Activities Division officers on the ground, killed Osama bin Laden in Abbottabad, Pakistan about from Islamabad in a CIA operation. President Barack Obama later confirmed the death of bin Laden, but did not directly mention the involvement of DEVGRU, saying only that a \"small team\" of Americans undertook the operation to bring down bin Laden. The unprecedented media coverage raised the public profile of the SEAL community, particularly the counter-terrorism specialists commonly known as SEAL Team 6. The Walt Disney Company tried unsuccessfully to trademark the name \"SEAL Team 6\" the day after the raid. The official name of the military operation was Operation Neptune Spear. The model of the compound used in the \"60 Minutes\" documentary was donated by CBS to the Navy SEAL Museum.\n\"Morning Glory\" oil tanker.\nOn 16 March 2014, thirty U.S. Navy SEALs from SEAL Team 2 took control of , a tanker full of oil loaded from a rebel-held port in Libya. The raid by Navy SEALs took place in international waters off the coast of Cyprus; the raid was a success, preventing a Libyan splinter militia group selling nationalized Libyan oil on the black market.\nOperation Inherent Resolve.\nAs part of Operation Inherent Resolve's Iraq Campaign, there are at least 100 SEALs as part of a Special Operations advise and assist mission to Peshmerga and Iraqi Security Forces in combating ISIS. The Navy SEAL operation in northern Iraq is called Task Force Trident. On 3 May 2016, Petty Officer 1st Class Charles Keating IV was killed by ISIS small arms fire near the town of Tel Skuf during an ISIS assault on a Peshmerga position. He was a member of a 20-man Quick Reaction Force (QRF) sent to rescue a dozen U.S. advisors at the position and temporarily assist the Peshmerga. Keating IV was awarded the Navy Cross, posthumously, for his actions.\nPersonnel.\nSelection and training.\nBefore getting accepted into Basic Underwater Demolition/SEAL (BUD/S) training, a prospective candidate must pass a certain number of both mental and physical requirements. These tests include: Pre-enlistment medical screening, ASVAB, AFQT, C-SORT, and PST. Then, the candidate must get a SEAL contract by passing the SEAL Physical Screening Test: 500-yard swim in 12:30, 50 push-ups in 2 minutes, 50 sit-ups in 2 minutes, 10 consecutive pull-ups in 2 minutes, and a 1.5-mile run in 10:30. Candidates receiving a passing score may then be admitted into training to become Navy SEALs. SEAL training is extremely rigorous. The attrition rate fluctuates, but averages at about 80 percent. The average candidate spends more than a year in a series of formal training courses before being awarded the Special Warfare Operator Naval Rating and the Navy Enlisted Classification (NEC) 5326 Combatant Swimmer (SEAL) or, in the case of commissioned naval officers, the designation Naval Special Warfare (SEAL) Officer.\nCandidates for the Special Warfare Operator (SO) rating must complete an extensive training pipeline beginning with Basic Underwater Demolition/SEAL (BUD/S) training in Coronado, California. Following BUD/S, candidates attend SEAL Qualification Training (SQT) to further develop tactical skills before earning their SEAL Trident. The entire process typically takes over a year, and the attrition rate for candidates exceeds 75 percent, reflecting the extreme physical and mental demands of the program.\nNavy SEAL training pipeline:\nUpon graduation from SQT, trainees receive the U.S. Navy SEAL Trident, designating them as Navy SEALs. They are subsequently assigned to a SEAL Team or SEAL Delivery Vehicle (SDV) Team and begin 18 months of predeployment training before they are considered deployable. This training consists of:\nThose enlisted SEALs with a medical rating will first attend the Special Operations Combat Medic Course for 6 months in Fort Bragg, North Carolina before joining a team in order to become a SEAL/Special Operator Corpsman. Those pursuing officer positions first attend the Junior Officer Training Course (JOTC) to learn about operations planning and how to perform team briefings. In total it can take over two-and-a-half years to completely train a Navy SEAL for his first deployment.\nWomen.\nUntil December 2015, female sailors were barred from becoming Navy SEALs by naval regulation; however, this prohibition no longer exists. As early as August 2015, it was reported that the \"Navy is planning to open its elite SEAL teams to women who can pass the grueling training regimen.\" In that same month, Admiral Jon Greenert, the Chief of Naval Operations at the time, said that \"he and the head of Naval Special Warfare Command, Rear Admiral Brian Losey, believe that if women can pass the legendary six-month Basic Underwater Demolition/SEAL (BUD/S) training, they should be allowed to serve.\" On 3 December 2015, it was announced that there are now \"no exceptions\" to all military roles in the U.S., and women can become U.S. Navy SEALs.\nSince the Navy opened up special warfare jobs to female sailors in 2016, 18 women have attempted to pass Special Warfare Combatant-craft Crewmen (SWCC) and SEAL training.\n\"The Washington Examiner\" reported on 10 August 2017: \"A woman aiming to become the first female Navy SEAL officer quit about a week into the initial training\".\nIn 2019, the Navy announced that an unnamed female officer was the first to successfully complete the SEAL Officer Assessment and Selection program (SOAS). She was one of a group of five female candidates to enter the program. She opted not to start BUD/S afterwards, instead choosing another assignment in the Navy.\nIssues.\nIn December 2016, the SEALs halted all training and ordered a safety stand-down because of substance abuse within its ranks. As part of the safety stand-down, all SEALs were required to submit to urinalysis. In August 2019, a review of the culture of Special Operations Command was ordered following cases of misconduct involving the SEALS, which included substance abuse by members of SEAL Team 10 and allegations of sexual assault and intoxication by a SEAL platoon in Iraq.\nIn 2021, SEAL team members appeared on CBS concealing their identities out of concern for retribution. They alerted the public to a culture of lawlessness, misconduct, and war crimes within their ranks.\nRelationship with CIA.\nThe CIA's highly secretive and elite Special Operations Group (SOG) recruits operators from SEAL Teams, with joint operations going back to the MACV-SOG during the Vietnam War. This cooperation still exists today, as evidenced by military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan.\nNavy SEAL teams and structures.\nThe total number of personnel, including SEALs and SWCCs assigned to Naval Special Warfare Command is approximately 8,195 out of a total 8,985 military staff, and 10,166 including civilian support staff, as of 2015.\nNaval Special Warfare Groups.\nNaval Special Warfare Command is organized into the following configuration:\nDeactivated Groups:\nSEAL Teams.\nThe original SEAL Teams were separated between West Coast (Team One) and East Coast (Team Two) SEALs. Likewise current SEAL Teams are organized into two groups: Naval Special Warfare Group One (West Coast) and Naval Special Warfare Group Two (East Coast), both of which come under the command of Naval Special Warfare Command at NAB Coronado, California. As of 2006[ [update]], there are eight confirmed Navy SEAL Teams. The current SEAL Team deployments include Teams 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, and 10. The most recent active-duty teams are SEAL Team 7 and SEAL Team 10, which were formed in March and April 2002, respectively. However, two reservist support teams were reorganized into SEAL teams in 2008.\nThe Teams deploy as Naval Special Warfare Squadrons or Special Operations Task Forces and can deploy anywhere in the world. Squadrons will normally be deployed and fall under a Joint Task Force (JTF) or a Combined Joint Special Operations Task Force (CJSOTF) as a Special Operations Task Force (SOTF).\nEach SEAL Team (or \"squadron\") is commanded by a Navy commander (O-5), and has eight operational SEAL platoons and a headquarters element. Operationally, the \"Team\" is divided into two to four 40-man \"task units\" (or \"troops\"). Each task unit consists of a headquarters element consisting of a task unit commander, typically a lieutenant commander (O-4), a task unit senior enlisted (E-8), a targeting/operations officer (O-2/3) and a targeting/operations leading/chief petty officer (E-6/7). Under the HQ element are two to four SEAL platoons of 16 men (two officers and 14 enlisted SEALs, and sometimes assigned non-NSW support personnel); a company-sized combat service support (CSS) and/or combat support (CS) consisting of staff N-codes (the Army and Marine Corps use S-codes); N1 Administrative support, N2 Intelligence, N3 Operations, N4 Logistics, N5 Plans and Targeting, N6 Communications, N7 Training, and N8 Air/Medical.\nEach 16-man platoon can be task organized for operational purposes into two eight-man squads, four four-man fire teams, or eight two-man sniper/reconnaissance teams. The size of each SEAL \"Team\", or \"squadron\", with two to four task units (containing a total of eight platoons) and support staff is approximately 300 personnel. The typical SEAL platoon has an OIC (officer in charge), usually a lieutenant (O-3), a platoon chief (E-7/E-8), and two squads commanded by a LTJG (O-2) and a squad leader (E-6). The remaining members of the squad are operators (E-4 to E-6) with their specialty skills in ordnance, communications, diving, and medical. The core leadership in the troop and platoon are the commander/OIC and the senior enlisted NCO (Senior Chief/chief).\nPlatoon core skills consist of: Sniper, Breacher, Communicator, Maritime/Engineering, Close Air Support, Corpsman, Point-man/Navigator, Primary Driver/Navigator (Rural/Urban/Protective Security), Heavy Weapons Operator, Sensitive Site Exploitation, Air Operations Master, Lead Climber, Lead Diver/Navigator, Interrogator, Explosive Ordnance Disposal, Technical Surveillance, and Advanced Special Operations.\nNaval Amphibious Base Little Creek, a naval base in Virginia Beach, Virginia, is home to SEAL Teams 2, 4, 8, 10, and 18. Naval Amphibious Base Coronado, a naval base in Coronado, California, is home to SEAL Teams 1, 3, 5, 7, and 17. There are also two SEAL Delivery Vehicle (SDV) units, SDVT-1 and SDVT-2, located in Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, and Little Creek, Virginia, respectively. SDV Teams are SEAL teams with an added underwater delivery capability. An SDV platoon consists of 12\u201315 SEALs.\nSpecial warfare ratings.\nThe Special Warfare Operator rating (SO) and Special Warfare Boat Operator rating (SB), were established in 2006. Special Warfare Operators (SEALs) and Special Warfare Boat Operators (SWCCs) are no longer required to maintain the original rating they qualified in upon joining the Navy.\nThe following ratings are specific to Navy SEALs:\nUnited States Navy Parachute Team \"Leap Frogs\".\nThe primary mission of the Navy Parachute Team (NPT) is to support Naval Special Warfare recruiting by gaining access and exposure to appropriate candidates through aerial parachuting demonstrations. The U.S. Navy Parachute Team is a fifteen-man team composed of U.S. Navy SEALs. Each member comes to the team for a three-year tour from one of the two Naval Special Warfare Groups located on the east and west coasts. On completion of the tour, members return to operational units. The parachute team began in 1969 when Navy SEALs and Frogmen volunteered to perform at weekend air shows. The Team initially consisted of five jumpers: LCDR Olson, PHC Gagliardi, SK2 \"Herky\" Hertenstein, PR1 Al Schmiz and PH2 \"Chip\" Maury. Schmiz and Maury were members of the original \"Chuting Stars.\" When LCDR Olson was transferred to California, PHC Gene \"Gag\" Gagliardi (D 546) of UDT Eleven introduced him to the local jumping elite with the San Diego Skydivers, one of the nation's first sports parachuting clubs. He convinced the Commander Naval Operations Support Group, PACIFIC to create a small demonstration team consisting of a cadre of highly qualified freefall jumpers. Its activities were to be conducted on a \"not to interfere\" basis with other military duties and at no cost to the government, other than utilizing normally scheduled aircraft. This group eventually adopted the \"Leap Frogs\" name.\nThe team was officially commissioned as the U.S. Navy Parachute Team in 1974 by the Chief of Naval Operations and assigned the mission of demonstrating Navy excellence throughout the United States. The East Coast-based \"Chuting Stars\" were disbanded in the 1980s with the \"Leap Frogs\" taking on all official parachute demonstrations within the Navy.\nA typical Leap Frogs' performance consists of six jumpers leaping out of an aircraft at an altitude of 6,000 feet. After freefalling sometimes using smoke or streamers, the Leap Frogs fly their canopies together to build canopy-relative work formations. After performances, the Leap Frogs make themselves available to the public to answer questions about the Navy and the Naval Special Warfare community, as well as to sign autographs.\nInfluence on foreign units.\nFrom its predecessors, the Underwater Demolition Teams, to its current form, the SEALs have influenced the training and formation of several foreign units. In 1955, the Underwater Demolition Teams provided funding and training for the Republic of Korea Naval Special Warfare Flotilla, who are also known as UDT/SEALs. This was followed in 1956 by providing funding, training and formation of the Philippine Navy Underwater Operations Team (UOT), patterned on the training and implementation of the US Navy SEALs and the UDTs. In 1966, United States Navy SEALs established Pakistan's Special Service Group based on a mutual security understanding and the training provided under the IMET program until the 1970s. U.S. Navy SEALs provided initial training to the Indian Marine Special Force, which later became known as the MARCOS.\nDue to their reputation as being one of America's premier special operations forces, SEALs (particularly operators from DEVGRU) will often do exchanges with allied SOFs.\nNational Navy UDT-SEAL Museum and memorial.\nThe National Navy UDT-SEAL Museum, in Fort Pierce, Florida, was founded in 1985 and was recognized as a National Museum by an act of Congress. The museum is dedicated to preserving the history of the Navy SEALs and their predecessors. The SEAL Museum stands on the training site of the first Navy frogmen. There through World War II, thousands of service members were trained as members of Naval Combat Demolition Units and Underwater Demolition Teams. The Museum houses rare historical artifacts from the founding of the UDT to present day, including weapons, vehicles, equipment, and most recently added, the lifeboat aboard which Somali pirates held Captain Richard Phillips hostage.\nNavy SEAL Memorial.\nAccording to the Navy SEAL Museum, 298 UDT and SEALs were killed in action and died during training accidents as of March 2018:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;"}

Essentially, fetishism is the attribution of inherent non-material value, or powers, to an object. Talismans and amulets are related. Fetishes are often used in spiritual or religious context.\nEtymology.\nThe word \"fetish\" derives from the French , which comes from the Portuguese or \"fetisso\" (\"spell\"), which in turn derives from a Latin root. However, there is some disagreement regarding \"which\" Latin root. William Pietz points to (\"to make\"). On the other hand, philosopher Charles De Brosses, who is cited as the source of the term \"fetishism,\" traces the etymology to the various Latin roots \"fatum, fanum,\" and \"fari\". Some scholars suggest that \"the instability in its linguistic origins is symptomatic of the concept's ambivalence, its lack of distinction between that which is enchanted and that which is fabricated or artificial.\"\nHistoriography.\nWilliam Pietz, who, in 1994, conducted an extensive ethno-historical study of the fetish, argues that the term originated in the coast of West Africa during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. Pietz distinguishes between, on the one hand, actual African objects that may be called fetishes in Europe, together with the indigenous theories of them, and on the other hand, \"fetish\", an idea, and an idea of a kind of object, to which the term above applies.\nThus, the term \"fetish\" has evolved from an idiom used to describe a type of object created in the interaction between European travelers and Native West Africans in the early modern period to an analytical term that played a central role in the perception and study of non-Western art in general and African art in particular. \nInitially, the Portuguese developed the concept of the fetish to refer to the objects used in religious practices by West African natives. The contemporary Portuguese may refer to more neutral terms such as \"charm\", \"enchantment\", or \"abracadabra\", or more potentially offensive terms such as \"juju\", \"witchcraft\", \"witchery\", \"conjuration\" or \"bewitchment\". The wide range of objects referred to as fetishes led to a dilution of the term\u2019s meaning. Often, objects were classified as fetishes indiscriminately because, from a European perspective, they did not fit into any other category.\nAccording to Pietz, the post-colonial concept of \"fetish\" emerged from the encounter between Europeans and Africans in a very specific historical context and in response to African material culture.\nHe begins his thesis with an introduction to the complex history of the word:\nMy argument, then, is that the fetish could originate only in conjunction with the emergent articulation of the ideology of the commodity form that defined itself within and against the social values and religious ideologies of two radically different types of noncapitalist society, as they encountered each other in an ongoing cross-cultural situation. This process is indicated in the history of the word itself as it developed from the late medieval Portuguese , to the sixteenth-century pidgin \"Fetisso\" on the African coast, to various northern European versions of the word via the 1602 text of the Dutchman Pieter de Marees... The fetish, then, not only originated from, but remains specific to, the problem of the social value of material objects as revealed in situations formed by the encounter of radically heterogeneous social systems, and a study of the history of the idea of the fetish may be guided by identifying those themes that persist throughout the various discourses and disciplines that have appropriated the term.\nStallybrass concludes that \"Pietz shows that the fetish as a concept was elaborated to demonize the supposedly arbitrary attachment of West Africans to material objects. The European subject was constituted in opposition to a demonized fetishism, through the disavowal of the object.\"\nThis pattern of demonized fetishism continued into the modern period. The concept was popularized in Europe circa 1757, when Charles de Brosses used it in comparing West African religion to the magical aspects of ancient Egyptian religion. Later, Auguste Comte employed the concept in his theory of the evolution of religion, wherein he posited fetishism as the earliest (most primitive) stage, followed by polytheism and monotheism. However, ethnography and anthropology would classify some artifacts of polytheistic and monotheistic religions as fetishes.\nThe eighteenth-century intellectuals who articulated the theory of fetishism encountered this notion in descriptions of \"Guinea\" contained in such popular voyage collections as Ramusio's \"Viaggio e Navigazioni\" (1550), de Bry's \"India Orientalis\" (1597), Purchas's \"Hakluytus Posthumus\" (1625), Churchill's \"Collection of Voyages and Travels\" (1732), Astley's \"A New General Collection of Voyages and Travels\" (1746), and Prevost's \"Histoire generale des voyages\" (1748).\nThe theory of fetishism was articulated at the end of the eighteenth century by G. W. F. Hegel in \"Lectures on the Philosophy of History\". According to Hegel, Africans were incapable of abstract thought, their ideas and actions were governed by impulse, and therefore a fetish object could be anything that then was arbitrarily imbued with \"imaginary powers\".\nPractice.\nThe use of the concept in the study of religion derives from studies of traditional West African religious beliefs, as well as from Vodun, which in turn derives from those beliefs.\nFetishes were commonly used in some Native American religions and practices. For example, the bear represented the shaman, the buffalo was the provider, the mountain lion was the warrior, and the wolf was the pathfinder, the cause of the war.\nJapan.\nKat\u014d Genchi (1873\u20131965), a Shinto priest and scholar of comparative religion, applied the term \"fetish\" to the historical study of traditional Japanese religion. He cited jewelry, swords, mirrors, and scarves as examples of fetishism in Shinto. In rural areas of Japan, he said he could find many traces of animism, totemism, fetishism, and phallicism. He also maintained that the Ten Sacred Treasures were fetishes and the Imperial Regalia of Japan retained the same traits, and pointed out the similarities with the \"Pusaka\" heirlooms of the natives of the East Indies and the sacred \"Tjurunga\" of the Central Australians. He noted that the divine sword , which was believed to provide supernatural protection ('blessings'), was deified and enshrined (at what is now the Atsuta Shrine). Akaruhime no Kami, the female deity of Hiyurikuso Shrine, was said to have originally been a red ball before transforming into a beautiful woman. The jewel around Izanagi-no-Mikoto's neck was deified and called .\nThe Anglo-Irish diplomat and scholar William George Aston (1841\u20131911) also maintained that could be seen as an example of fetishism. Originally an offering, the enshrined sword became a (lit. 'spirit representative', 'spirit-token'), more commonly known as the (lit. 'god-body'; a sacred object containing the or 'spirit'). Aston observed that people tended to think of the ('spirit') of a deity first as the seat of his or her real presence, and secondly as the deity itself. In practice, the distinction between and was fluid, and even came to be identified as the god's body. For example, the cooking furnace () itself was worshiped as a deity. Given the vagueness of such distinctions \u2013 further accentuated by the restricted usage of images (e.g., in painting or sculpture) \u2013 there was a tendency to ascribe special virtues to certain physical objects in place of the deity.\nIn modern times, the American linguist Roy Andrew Miller (1924\u20132014) observed that the pamphlet of the nationalistic proclamation (1937) and the Imperial Rescript on Education (1890) were also often worshipped as \"fetishes\", and were respectfully placed and kept in household altars ().\nPhilippines.\nIn the pre-colonial Philippine context, Anito fetishes were central to the animistic beliefs of the early Filipinos. These objects, often human-made, served as physical representations of spiritual entities or ancestral spirits. Their role in rituals, worship, and daily life illustrates the rich spiritual tradition of the early Austronesian peoples who inhabited the Philippine archipelago. Anito fetishes refer to objects imbued with spiritual significance, often crafted to house or represent spirits collectively known as Anito. These were usually Ancestor Spirits also called Anito The souls of deceased relatives who provided guidance, protection, or blessings to their descendants. Anito fetishes were typically carved from wood, stone, or bone, and they served as both a focus of worship and a conduit for spiritual energy. Anito fetishes were placed in shrines or sacred areas where offerings such as food, drinks, or animal sacrifices were made. These offerings were meant to appease or gain favours from the ancestor spirits and spirits of the dead and deities and celestial beings called Diwata. The term Anito is deeply rooted in Austronesian linguistic heritage, with similar terms found across related culture Proto-Malayo-Polynesian: qanitu (spirit of the dead) Proto-Austronesian: qaNiCu (ancestor spirit) Indonesian and Malaysian: Hantu or Antu (spirit or ghost) Polynesian: Atua or Aitu (ancestral ghost\u00a0 or spirit) Anito\u2014widely understood today by Filipinos in the Philippines in contemporary as referring to ancestor spirits or spirits of the dead, evil spirits and the wooden idols and fetish that represent them.Anito In Philippine mythology, refers to ancestor spirits, spirits of the dead, evil spirits and the wooden idols that represent or house them. In contrast, within the context of folk religion\nDR Congo.\nMade and used by the BaKongo of western DRC, a \"nkisi\" (plural ) is a sculptural object that provides a local habitation for a spiritual personality. Though some have always been anthropomorphic, they were probably much less \"naturalistic\" or \"realistic\" before the arrival of the Europeans in the nineteenth century; Kongo figures are more naturalistic in the coastal areas than inland. As Christians tend to think of spirits as objects of worship, idols become the objects of idolatry when worship was addressed to false gods. In this way, European Christian colonialists regarded as idols on the basis of religious bias.\nThe foreign Christians often called \"fetishes\" and sometimes \"idols\" because they are sometimes rendered in human form or semi-human form. Modern anthropology has generally referred to these objects either as \"power objects\" or as \"charms\".\nIn addressing the question of whether a is a fetish, William McGaffey writes that the Kongo ritual system as a whole,\nbears a relationship similar to that which Marx supposed that \"political economy\" bore to capitalism as its \"religion\", but not for the reasons advanced by Bosman, the Enlightenment thinkers, and Hegel. The irrationally \"animate\" character of the ritual system's symbolic apparatus, including , divination devices, and witch-testing ordeals, obliquely expressed real relations of power among the participants in ritual. \"Fetishism\" is about relations among people, rather than the objects that mediate and disguise those relations.\nTherefore, McGaffey concludes, to call a a fetish is to translate \"certain Kongo realities into the categories developed in the emergent social sciences of nineteenth century, post-enlightenment Europe.\"\nNotes and references.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He is well known for having died while fighting in the Battle of Cr\u00e9cy at age 50, after having been blind for a decade. In his home country of Luxembourg, he is considered a national hero. Comparatively, in the Czech Republic (anciently the Kingdom of Bohemia), Jan Lucembursk\u00fd is often recognized for his role as the father of Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor, one of the more significant Kings of Bohemia and one of the leading Holy Roman Emperors.\nEarly life.\nJohn was the eldest son of Henry VII, Holy Roman Emperor and Margaret of Brabant, who was the daughter of John\u00a0I, Duke of Brabant and Margaret of Flanders. Born in Luxembourg and raised in Paris, John was French by education but deeply involved in the politics of Germany.\nIn 1310, his father arranged the marriage of 14-year-old John to Elizabeth of Bohemia. The wedding took place in Speyer, after which the newlyweds made their way to Prague accompanied by a group led by the experienced diplomat and expert on Czech issues, Peter of Aspelt, Archbishop of Mainz. Because the emperor had imperial Czech regiments accompany and protect the couple from Nuremberg to Prague, John was thus forced to invade Bohemia on behalf of his wife Elizabeth. The Czech forces were able to gain control of Prague and depose the reigning king, Henry of Gorizia, King of Bohemia, on 3 December 1310. The deposed King Henry fled with his wife Anne of Bohemia (the sister of John's wife) to his duchy (the Duchy of Carinthia). The coronation of John and Elizabeth to the Bohemian throne took place on 7 February 1311, making them King and Queen of Bohemia. The castle at Prague was uninhabitable, so John made residence in one of the houses on the Old Town Square, and with the help of his advisors, he stabilized affairs in the Czech state. He thereby became one of the seven prince-electors of the Holy Roman Empire and \u2013 in succession of his brother-in-law Wenceslaus III of Bohemia \u2013 claimant to the Polish and Hungarian throne. His attempts to follow his father as King of the Romans failed with the election of Louis IV of Bavaria in 1314. Nevertheless, John later would support Louis IV in his rivalry with Frederick the Fair, King of Germany, culminating in the 1322 Battle of M\u00fchldorf in which, in return, he received the Czech region of Egerland as a reward.\nProblems with nobility.\nLike his predecessor Henry, he was disliked by much of the Czech nobility. John was considered an \"alien king\" and gave up the administration of Bohemia after a while and embarked on a life of travel. He parted ways with his wife and left the Czech country to be ruled by the barons while spending time in Luxembourg and the French court.\nJohn's travels took him to Silesia, Poland, Lithuania, Tyrol, Northern Italy and Papal Avignon. A rival of King W\u0142adys\u0142aw I the Elbow-high to the Polish crown, John supported the Teutonic Knights in the Polish\u2013Teutonic War from 1326 to 1332. He also made several Silesian dukes swear an oath of allegiance to him. In 1335 in Congress of Visegr\u00e1d, W\u0142adys\u0142aw's successor King Casimir III the Great of Poland paid a significant amount of money in exchange for John's giving up his claim to the Polish throne.\nJohn's first steps as king were re-establishing authority and securing peace within the country. In 1311, he reached an agreement with the Bohemian and Moravian aristocracy, referred to as the \"inaugural diplomas\", with which John restricted the relations of both the ruler and aristocracy. The aristocracy was, however, allowed to hold the right to elect the king, to decide the matter of extraordinary taxation, the right to their property, and the right to choose freely whether or not to offer military support to the king in foreign wars. However, the aristocracy was encouraged to raise armies when peace within the country was threatened. On the other hand, the king's right to appoint a foreign official to office was abolished. John structured these agreements to provide a basis for consolidating the ruler's power within the Bohemian kingdom. The agreements weren't as successful as John intended. The aristocracy did not intend to surrender its property and the influence it gained after Wenceslas II died.\nThe growing tensions within the aristocracy and the lack of communication due to John's consistent absence in Bohemia led to a competition between two factions of the Czech nobility. One party, led by Jind\u0159ich of Lip\u00e1, gained the trust of John. The other party, led by Vil\u00e9m Zaj\u00edc of Valdek (Latin: \"Wilhelmus Lepus de Waldek\"; German: ), convinced the Queen that Lord Lip\u00e1 intended to overthrow John. Consequently, in 1315, John had Jind\u0159ich imprisoned.\nBy 1318, John had reconciled with the nobility and recognised their rights, further establishing dualism of the Estates and a government division between the king and the nobles.\nInternational politics.\nForeign politics, rather than Czech, appealed to John, as he was gifted at it. With the help of his father, Henry, John was able to pressure the Habsburgs into reaching an agreement over Moravia. He was also able to pressure the House of Wettin, princes of Saxony, to give over the territory lying to the northern border of the Czech state. John also decided to improve relations with the Silesian principalities close to Bohemia and Moravia in economic and political standings. \nThe international spectrum was further broadened for John when his father named him Imperial Vicar, his deputy for the governance of the Empire. This allowed John to reach further, and he contributed to the imperial coronation along with helping with the conclusion of the Italian territorial wars. In 1313, Henry died suddenly, ending this collaboration between him and John. However, through Henry's death, a spot for the imperial crown opened up, making John a possible candidate, the other two candidates being Fredrick of Habsburg and Louis of Bavaria.\nIn attempts not to support Fredrick, John voted for Louis at the diet of electors. In return for his support, Louis, as the new emperor, promised the support in territorial claims of the Czech state in Silesia and Meissen as well as the region of Cheb and the Upper Palatinate. Later, in 1319, after the Brandenburg House of Ascania died out, John regained control over the Bautzen region and then the G\u00f6rlitz region in 1329.\nIn 1322/23, King John became unsettled by Louis's growing power and allied with France and Austria against him. The dispute would escalate with his son Charles claiming the Imperial crown in opposition to Louis.\nDeath.\nJohn lost his eyesight at age 39 or 40 from ophthalmia in 1336, while crusading in Lithuania. A treatment by the famous physician Guy de Chauliac had no positive effects. At the outbreak of the Hundred Years' War in 1337, he allied with King Philip VI of France and was even appointed governor of Languedoc from 30 November 1338 to November 1340. At the Battle of Cr\u00e9cy in 1346 John controlled Phillip's advanced guard along with managing the large contingents of Charles II of Alen\u00e7on and Louis I, Count of Flanders. John was killed at age 50 while fighting against the English during the battle. The medieval chronicler Jean Froissart left the following account of John's last actions:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;...for all that he was nigh blind, when he understood the order of the battle, he said to them about him: 'Where is the lord Charles my son?' His men said: 'Sir, we cannot tell; we think he be fighting.' Then he said: 'Sirs, ye are my men, my companions and friends in this journey: I require you bring me so far forward, that I may strike one stroke with my sword.' They said they would do his commandment, and to the intent that they should not lose him in the press, they tied all their reins of their bridles each to other and set the king before to accomplish his desire, and so they went on their enemies. The lord Charles of Bohemia his son, who wrote himself king of Almaine and bare the arms, he came in good order to the battle; but when he saw that the matter went awry on their party, he departed, I cannot tell you which way. The king his father was so far forward that he strake a stroke with his sword, yea and more than four, and fought valiantly and so did his company; and they adventured themselves so forward, that they were there all slain, and the next day they were found in the place about the king, and all their horses tied each to other.\nAccording to the \"Cronica ecclesiae Pragensis Benesii Krabice de Weitmile\", when told by his aides that the battle against the English at Cr\u00e9cy was lost and he should flee to save his own life, John the Blind replied: \"\"Absit, ut rex Boemie fugeret, sed illuc me ducite, ubi maior strepitus certaminis vigeret, Dominus sit nobiscum, nil timeamus, tantum filium meum diligenter custodite.\" (\"Far be it that the King of Bohemia should run away. Instead, take me to the place where the noise of the battle is the loudest. The Lord will be with us. Nothing to fear. Just take good care of my son.\")\nJohn was succeeded as King of Bohemia by his eldest son, Charles. In Luxembourg, he was succeeded by Wenceslaus, his son by his second wife.\nBurial.\nThe body of John the Blind was moved to Kloster Altm\u00fcnster (\"Old-Minster Abbey\") in Luxembourg. When the abbey was destroyed in 1543, the corpse was moved to Kloster Neum\u00fcnster (\"New-Minster Abbey\") in Luxembourg. During the confusion of the French Revolution, the mortal remains were salvaged by the Boch industrialist family (founders of Villeroy &amp; Boch, ennobled in 1892) and hidden in an attic room in Mettlach on the Saar River. The legend is that the abbey monks asked Pierre-Joseph Boch for this favour.\nHis son Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Boch met with the future King Frederick William IV of Prussia on his voyage through the Rhineland in 1833, offering the remains as a gift. As Frederick William counted John the Blind among his ancestors, he ordered Karl Friedrich Schinkel to construct a funeral chapel. The chapel was built in 1834 and 1835 near Kastel-Staadt on a rock above the town. In 1838, on the anniversary of his death, John the Blind was laid in a black marble sarcophagus in a public ceremony.\nIn 1945, the Luxembourg government took the chance to obtain possession of the bones. In a cloak and dagger operation, the remains were moved to the crypt of the Notre-Dame Cathedral, Luxembourg. The inscription on the tomb reads: \"\"\nFamily and children.\nJohn was married twice:\nFirst, to Elisabeth of Bohemia, the daughter of King Wenceslaus II of Bohemia. In this marriage he had the following children:\nSecond (December 1334), to Beatrice of Bourbon, daughter of Louis I, Duke of Bourbon. This marriage produced one son:\nHis illegitimate son Nicolaus was Patriarch of Aquileia from 1350 to 1358.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

This space exploration project was conducted by the NASA Ames Research Center in California. The space probe was manufactured by TRW Inc.\n\"Pioneer 10\" was assembled around a hexagonal bus with a diameter parabolic dish high-gain antenna, and the spacecraft was spin stabilized around the axis of the antenna. Its electric power was supplied by four radioisotope thermoelectric generators that provided a combined 155\u00a0watts at launch.\nIt was launched on March 3, 1972, at 01:49:00\u00a0UTC (March\u00a02 local time), by an Atlas-Centaur rocket from Cape Canaveral, Florida. Between July 15, 1972, and February 15, 1973, it became the first spacecraft to traverse the asteroid belt. Photography of Jupiter began on November 6, 1973, at a range of , and about 500 images were transmitted. The closest approach to the planet was on December 3, 1973, at a range of . During the mission, the on-board instruments were used to study the asteroid belt, the environment around Jupiter, the solar wind, cosmic rays, and eventually the far reaches of the Solar System and heliosphere.\nRadio communications were lost with \"Pioneer 10\" on January 23, 2003, because of the loss of electric power for its radio transmitter. At the time, the probe was from Earth.\nMission background.\nHistory.\nIn the 1960s, American aerospace engineer Gary Flandro of the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory conceived of a mission, known as the Planetary Grand Tour, that would exploit a rare alignment of the outer planets of the Solar System. This mission would ultimately be accomplished in the late 1970s by the two Voyager probes, but in order to prepare for it, NASA decided in 1964 to experiment with launching a pair of probes to the outer Solar System. An advocacy group named the Outer Space Panel and chaired by American space scientist James A. Van Allen, worked out the scientific rationale for exploring the outer planets. NASA Goddard Spaceflight Center put together a proposal for a pair of \"Galactic Jupiter Probes\" that would pass through the asteroid belt and visit Jupiter. These were to be launched in 1972 and 1973 during favorable windows that occurred only a few weeks every 13 months. Launch during other time intervals would have been more costly in terms of propellant requirements.\nApproved by NASA in February 1969, the twin spacecraft were designated \"Pioneer\u00a0F\" and \"Pioneer\u00a0G\" before launch; later, they were named \"Pioneer 10\" and \"Pioneer 11\" respectively. They formed part of the Pioneer program, a series of United States uncrewed space missions launched between 1958 and 1978. This model was the first in the series to be designed for exploring the outer Solar System. Based on proposals issued throughout the 1960s, the early mission objectives were to explore the interplanetary medium past the orbit of Mars, study the asteroid belt and assess the possible hazard to spacecraft traveling through the belt, and explore Jupiter and its environment. Later development-stage objectives included the probe closely approaching Jupiter to provide data on the effect the environmental radiation surrounding Jupiter would have on the spacecraft instruments.\nMore than 150 scientific experiments were proposed for the missions. The experiments to be carried on the spacecraft were selected in a series of planning sessions during the 1960s, then were finalized by early 1970. These would be to perform imaging and polarimetry of Jupiter and several of its satellites, make infrared and ultraviolet observations of Jupiter, detect asteroids and meteoroids, determine the composition of charged particles, and to measure magnetic fields, plasma, cosmic rays and the zodiacal light. Observation of the spacecraft communications as it passed behind Jupiter would allow measurements of the planetary atmosphere, while tracking data would improve estimates of the mass of Jupiter and its moons.\nNASA Ames Research Center, rather than Goddard, was selected to manage the project as part of the Pioneer program. The Ames Research Center, under the direction of Charles F. Hall, was chosen because of its previous experience with spin-stabilized spacecraft. The requirements called for a small, lightweight spacecraft which was magnetically clean and which could perform an interplanetary mission. It was to use spacecraft modules that had already been proven in the \"Pioneer\u00a06\" through \"9\" missions. Ames commissioned a documentary film by George Van Valkenburg titled \"Jupiter Odyssey\". It received numerous international awards, and is visible on Van Valkenburg's YouTube channel.\nIn February 1970, Ames awarded a combined US$380\u00a0million contract to TRW Inc. for building both of the \"Pioneer\u00a010\" and \"11\" vehicles, bypassing the usual bidding process to save time. B. J. O'Brien and Herb Lassen led the TRW team that assembled the spacecraft. Design and construction of the spacecraft required an estimated 25\u00a0million man-hours. An engineer from TRW quipped, \"This spacecraft is guaranteed for two years of interplanetary flight. If any component fails within that warranty period, just return the spacecraft to our shop and we will repair it free of charge.\"\nTo meet the schedule, the first launch would need to take place between February 29 and March 17 so that it could arrive at Jupiter in November 1974. This was later revised to an arrival date of December 1973 in order to avoid conflicts with other missions over the use of the Deep Space Network for communications, and to miss the period when Earth and Jupiter would be at opposite sides of the Sun. The encounter trajectory for \"Pioneer\u00a010\" was selected to maximize the information returned about the radiation environment around Jupiter, even if this caused damage to some systems. It would come within about three times the radius of the planet, which was thought to be the closest it could approach and still survive the radiation. The trajectory chosen would give the spacecraft a good view of the sunlit side.\nSpacecraft design.\nThe \"Pioneer 10\" bus measures deep and with six long panels forming the hexagonal structure. The bus houses propellant to control the orientation of the probe and eight of the eleven scientific instruments. The equipment compartment lay within an aluminum honeycomb structure to provide protection from meteoroids. A layer of insulation, consisting of aluminized mylar and kapton blankets, provides passive thermal control. Heat was generated by the dissipation of 70 to 120 watts (W) from the electrical components inside the compartment. The heat range was maintained within the operating limits of the equipment by means of louvers located below the mounting platform. The spacecraft had a launch mass of about .\nAt launch, the spacecraft carried of liquid hydrazine monopropellant in a diameter spherical tank. Orientation of the spacecraft is maintained with six 4.5 N, hydrazine thrusters mounted in three pairs. Pair one maintained a constant spin-rate of 4.8 rpm, pair two controlled the forward thrust, and pair three controlled the attitude. The attitude pair were used in conical scanning maneuvers to track Earth in its orbit. Orientation information was also provided by a star sensor able to reference Canopus, and two Sun sensors.\nPower and communications.\n\"Pioneer 10\" uses four SNAP-19 radioisotope thermoelectric generators (RTGs). They are positioned on two three-rod trusses, each in length and 120 degrees apart. This was expected to be a safe distance from the sensitive scientific experiments carried on board. Combined, the RTGs provided 155\u00a0W at launch, and decayed to 140\u00a0W in transit to Jupiter. The spacecraft required 100\u00a0W to power all systems. The generators are powered by the radioisotope fuel plutonium-238, which is housed in a multi-layer capsule protected by a graphite heat shield.\nThe pre-launch requirement for the SNAP-19 was to provide power for two years in space; this was greatly exceeded during the mission. The plutonium-238 has a half-life of 87.74 years, so that after 29 years the radiation being generated by the RTGs was at 80% of its intensity at launch. However, steady deterioration of the thermocouple junctions led to a more rapid decay in electrical power generation, and by 2001 the total power output was 65\u00a0W. As a result, later in the mission only selected instruments could be operated at any one time.\nThe space probe includes a redundant system of transceivers, one attached to the narrow-beam, high-gain antenna, the other to an omni-antenna and medium-gain antenna. The parabolic dish for the high-gain antenna is in diameter and made from an aluminum honeycomb sandwich material. The spacecraft was spun about an axis that is parallel to the axis of this antenna so that it could remain oriented toward the Earth. Each transceiver is an 8\u00a0W one and transmits data across the S-band using 2110\u00a0MHz for the uplink from Earth and 2292\u00a0MHz for the downlink to Earth with the Deep Space Network tracking the signal. Data to be transmitted is passed through a convolutional encoder so that most communication errors could be corrected by the receiving equipment on Earth. The data transmission rate at launch was 256\u00a0bit/s, with the rate degrading by about 1.27\u00a0millibit/s for each day during the mission.\nMuch of the computation for the mission is performed on Earth and transmitted to the spacecraft, where it was able to retain in memory up to five commands of the 222 possible entries by ground controllers. The spacecraft includes two command decoders and a command distribution unit, a very limited form of a processor, to direct operations on the spacecraft. This system requires that mission operators prepare commands long in advance of transmitting them to the probe. A data storage unit is included to record up to 6,144\u00a0bytes of information gathered by the instruments. The digital telemetry unit is used to prepare the collected data in one of the thirteen possible formats before transmitting it back to Earth.\nMission profile.\nLaunch and trajectory.\n\"Pioneer 10\" was launched on March 3, 1972, at 01:49:00\u00a0UTC (8:49\u00a0p.m. Eastern Standard Time on March\u00a02) by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration from Space Launch Complex 36A in Florida, aboard an Atlas-Centaur. The third stage of the expendable vehicle consisted of a solid fuel Star-37E stage (TE-M-364-4) developed specifically for the Pioneer missions. This stage provided about of thrust and spun up the spacecraft. The spacecraft had an initial spin rate of 30\u00a0rpm. Twenty minutes following the launch, the vehicle's three booms were extended, which slowed the rotation rate to 4.8\u00a0rpm. This rate was maintained throughout the voyage. The launch vehicle accelerated the probe for a net interval of 17\u00a0minutes, reaching a velocity of .\nAfter the high-gain antenna was contacted, several of the instruments were activated for testing while the spacecraft was moving through the Earth's radiation belts. Ninety minutes after launch, the spacecraft reached interplanetary space. \"Pioneer 10\" passed by the Moon in 11 hours, and became the fastest human-made object at that time. Two days after launch, the scientific instruments were turned on, beginning with the cosmic ray telescope. After ten days, all of the instruments were active.\nDuring the first seven months of the journey, the spacecraft made three course corrections. The on-board instruments underwent checkouts, with the photometers examining Jupiter and the Zodiacal light, and experiment packages being used to measure cosmic rays, magnetic fields and the solar wind. The only anomaly during this interval was the failure of the Canopus sensor, which instead required the spacecraft to maintain its orientation using the two Sun sensors.\nWhile passing through interplanetary medium, \"Pioneer 10\" became the first mission to detect interplanetary atoms of helium. It also observed high-energy ions of aluminum and sodium in the solar wind. The spacecraft recorded important heliophysics data in early August 1972 by registering a solar shock wave when it was at a distance of . On July 15, 1972, \"Pioneer 10\" was the first spacecraft to enter the asteroid belt, located between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter. The project planners expected a safe passage through the belt, and the closest the trajectory would take the spacecraft to any of the known asteroids was . One of the nearest approaches was to the asteroid 307 Nike on December 2, 1972.\nThe on-board experiments demonstrated a deficiency of particles below a micrometer (\u03bcm) in the belt, as compared to the vicinity of the Earth. The density of dust particles between 10 and 100\u00a0\u03bcm did not vary significantly during the trip from the Earth to the outer edge of the belt. Only for particles with a diameter of 100\u00a0\u03bcm to 1.0\u00a0mm did the density show an increase, by a factor of three in the region of the belt. No fragments larger than a millimeter were observed in the belt, indicating these are likely rare; certainly much less common than anticipated. As the spacecraft did not collide with any particles of substantial size, it passed safely through the belt, emerging on the other side about February 15, 1973.\nEncounter with Jupiter.\nOn November 6, 1973, the \"Pioneer 10\" spacecraft was at a distance of from Jupiter. Testing of the imaging system began, and the data were successfully received back at the Deep Space Network. A series of 16,000 commands were then uploaded to the spacecraft to control the flyby operations during the next sixty days. The orbit of the outer moon Sinope was crossed on November\u00a08. The bow shock of Jupiter's magnetosphere was reached on November 16, as indicated by a drop in the velocity of the solar wind from to . The magnetopause was passed through a day later. The spacecraft instruments confirmed that the magnetic field of Jupiter was inverted compared to that of Earth. By the 29th, the orbits of all of the outermost moons had been passed, and the spacecraft was operating flawlessly.\nRed and blue pictures of Jupiter were being generated by the imaging photopolarimeter as the rotation of the spacecraft carried the instrument's field of view past the planet. These red and blue colors were combined to produce a synthetic green image, allowing a three-color combination to produce the rendered image. On November 26, a total of twelve such images were received back on Earth. By December 2, the image quality exceeded the best images made from Earth. These were being displayed in real-time back on Earth, and the Pioneer program would later receive an Emmy award for this presentation to the media. The motion of the spacecraft produced geometric distortions that later had to be corrected by computer processing. During the encounter, a total of more than 500 images were transmitted.\nThe trajectory of the spacecraft took it along the magnetic equator of Jupiter, where the ion radiation was concentrated. Peak flux for this electron radiation is 10,000 times stronger than the maximum radiation around the Earth. Pioneer 10 passed through the inner radiation belts within 20\u00a0\"R\"J, receiving an integrated dose of 200,000 rads from electrons and 56,000 rads from protons (in comparison, a whole body dose of 500 rads is fatal to humans). The level of radiation at Jupiter was ten times more powerful than Pioneer's designers had predicted, leading to fears that the probe would not survive. Starting on December 3, the radiation around Jupiter caused false commands to be generated. Most of these were corrected by contingency commands, but an image of Io and a few close-ups of Jupiter were lost. Similar false commands would be generated on the way out from the planet. Nonetheless, \"Pioneer 10\" did succeed in obtaining images of the moons Ganymede and Europa. The image of Ganymede showed low albedo features in the center and near the south pole, while the north pole appeared brighter. Europa was too far away to obtain a detailed image, although some albedo features were apparent.\nThe trajectory of \"Pioneer 10\" was chosen to take it behind Io, allowing the refractive effect of the moon's atmosphere on the radio transmissions to be measured. This demonstrated that the ionosphere of the moon was about above the surface of the day side, and the density ranged from 60,000 electrons per cubic centimeter on the dayside to 9,000 electrons per cubic centimeter on the night face. An unexpected discovery was that Io was orbiting within a cloud of hydrogen that extended for about , with a width and height of . A smaller, cloud was believed to have been detected near Europa.\nIt was not until after \"Pioneer 10\" had cleared the asteroid belt that NASA selected a trajectory towards Jupiter which included a slingshot effect to send the spacecraft out of the Solar System. \"Pioneer 10\" was the first spacecraft to attempt such a maneuver, a model for future missions. Such an extended mission was not in the initial proposal, but was planned for prior to launch.\nAt the closest approach, the velocity of the spacecraft reached , and it came within of the outer atmosphere of Jupiter. Close-up images of the Great Red Spot and the terminator were obtained. Communication with the spacecraft then ceased as it passed behind the planet. The radio occultation data allowed the temperature structure of the outer atmosphere to be measured, showing a temperature inversion between the altitudes with 10 and 100\u00a0mbar pressures. Temperatures at the 10-mbar level ranged from , while temperatures at the 100\u00a0mbar level were . The spacecraft generated an infrared map of the planet, which confirmed the idea that the planet radiated more heat than it received from the Sun.\nCrescent images of the planet were then returned as \"Pioneer 10\" moved away from the planet. As the spacecraft headed outward, it again passed the bow shock of Jupiter's magnetosphere. As this front is constantly shifting in space because of dynamic interaction with the solar wind, the vehicle crossed the bow shock a total of 17 times before it escaped completely.\nDeep space.\n\"Pioneer 10\" crossed the orbit of Saturn in 1976 and the orbit of Uranus in 1979. On June 13, 1983, the craft crossed the orbit of Neptune, and so became the first human-made object to leave the proximity of the major planets of the Solar System. The mission came to an official end on March 31, 1997, when it had reached a distance of from the Sun, though the spacecraft was still able to transmit coherent data after this date.\nAfter March 31, 1997, \"Pioneer 10\"'s weak signal continued to be tracked by the Deep Space Network to aid the training of flight controllers in the process of acquiring deep-space radio signals. There was an Advanced Concepts study applying chaos theory to extract coherent data from the fading signal.\nThe last successful reception of telemetry was received from \"Pioneer 10\" on April 27, 2002; subsequent signals were barely strong enough to detect and provided no usable data. The final, very weak signal from \"Pioneer 10\" was received on January 23, 2003, when it was from Earth. Further attempts to contact the spacecraft were unsuccessful. A final attempt was made on the evening of March 4, 2006, the last time the antenna would be correctly aligned with Earth. No response was received from \"Pioneer 10\". NASA decided that the RTG units had probably fallen below the power threshold needed to operate the transmitter. Hence, no further attempts at contact were made.\nCurrent status and future.\nOn July 18, 2023, \"Voyager 2\" overtook \"Pioneer 10\", making \"Pioneer 10\" the third farthest spacecraft from the Sun after \"Voyager 1\" and \"Voyager 2\". As of July 2025, the probe is estimated to be from Earth and from the Sun. Sunlight takes 18.9\u00a0hours to reach \"Pioneer 10\". The brightness of the Sun from the spacecraft is magnitude \u221216.0. \"Pioneer 10\" is currently travelling in the direction of the constellation Taurus.\nIf left undisturbed, \"Pioneer 10\" and its sister craft \"Pioneer 11\" will join the two Voyager spacecraft and the \"New Horizons\" spacecraft in leaving the Solar System to wander the interstellar medium. The \"Pioneer 10\" trajectory is expected to take it in the general direction of the star Aldebaran, currently located at a distance of about 68\u00a0light years. If Aldebaran had zero relative velocity, it would require more than two million years for the spacecraft to reach it. Well before that, in about 90,000 years, \"Pioneer 10\" will pass about from the late K-type star HIP\u00a0117795. This is the closest stellar flyby in the next few million years of all the \"Pioneer\", \"Voyager\", and \"New\u00a0Horizons\" spacecraft, which are leaving the Solar System.\nA backup unit, \"Pioneer H\", is currently on display in the \"Milestones of Flight\" gallery at the National Air and Space Museum in Washington, D.C. Many elements of the mission proved to be critical in the planning of the Voyager program.\nPioneer plaque.\nBecause it was strongly advocated by Carl Sagan, \"Pioneer 10\" and \"Pioneer 11\" carry a gold-anodized aluminum plaque in case either spacecraft is ever found by intelligent life-forms from another planetary system. The plaques feature the nude figures of a human male and female along with several symbols that are designed to provide information about the origin of the spacecraft. The plaque is attached to the antenna support struts where it would be shielded from interstellar dust.\n\"Pioneer 10\" in popular media.\nIn the film \"\", a Klingon Bird-of-Prey destroys \"Pioneer 10\" as target practice.\nIn the serialized speculative fiction multimedia narrative \"17776\", one of the main characters is a sentient \"Pioneer 10\".\nIn the 1995 video game Chaos Control, an alien encounter with Pioneer 10 initiates a conflict between the alien race and humanity.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The menstrual cycle is characterized by the rise and fall of hormones. Menstruation is triggered by falling progesterone levels, and is a sign that pregnancy has not occurred. Feminine hygiene products are used in order to maintain hygiene during menses.\nThe first period, a point in time known as menarche, usually begins during puberty, between the ages of 11 and 13. However, menstruation starting as young as eight years would still be considered normal. The average age of the first period is generally later in the developing world, and earlier in the developed world. The typical length of time between the first day of one period and the first day of the next is 21 to 45 days in young women; in adults, the range is between 21 and 35 days with the average often cited as 28 days. In the largest study of menstrual app data, the mean menstrual cycle length was determined to be 29.3 days. Bleeding typically lasts two to seven days. Periods stop during pregnancy and typically do not resume during the initial months of breastfeeding. Lochia occurs after childbirth. Menstruation, and with it the possibility of pregnancy, ceases after menopause, which usually occurs between 45 and 55 years of age.\nDuring their menstrual period, 38% of all women reported not to be able to perform all their regular daily activities. Symptoms in advance of menstruation that do interfere with normal life are called premenstrual syndrome (PMS). Some 20 to 30% of women experience PMS, with 3 to 8% experiencing severe symptoms. These include acne, tender breasts, bloating, feeling tired, irritability, and mood changes. Other symptoms some women experience include painful periods (estimates are between 50 and 90%) and heavy bleeding during menstruation and abnormal bleeding at any time during the menstrual cycle. A lack of periods, known as amenorrhea, is when periods do not occur by age 15 or have not re-occurred in ninety days.&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCharacteristics.\nLength and duration.\nThe first menstrual period occurs after the onset of pubertal growth, and is called menarche. The average age of menarche is 12 to 15 years. However, it may occur as early as eight. The average age of the first period is generally later in the developing world, and earlier in the developed world. The average age of menarche has changed little in the United States since the 1950s.\nMenstruation is the most visible phase of the menstrual cycle and its beginning is used as the marker between cycles. The first day of menstrual bleeding is the date used for the last menstrual period (LMP). The typical length of time between the first day of one period and the first day of the next is 21 to 45 days in young women, and 21 to 35 days in adults. The average menstrual cycle length is conventionally said to be 28 days. In the largest study using data from menstrual apps, the mean menstrual cycle length was determined as 29.3 days. The variability of menstrual cycle lengths is highest for women under 25 years of age and is lowest, that is, most regular, for ages 25 to 39 years. The variability increases slightly for women aged 40 to 44 years.\nPerimenopause refers to the transitional phase leading up to menopause, marked by hormonal changes and irregular menstrual cycles, when a woman stops menstruating completely and is no longer fertile. The medical definition of menopause is one year without a period and typically occurs between 45 and 55 years in Western countries. Menopause before age 45 is considered \"premature\" in industrialized countries. Illnesses, certain surgeries, or medical treatments may cause menopause to occur earlier than it might have otherwise.\nMenstrual fluid.\nThe average volume of menstrual fluid during a monthly menstrual period is with considered typical. \"Menstrual fluid\" is the correct term for the flow, although many people prefer to refer to it as \"menstrual blood\". Menstrual fluid is reddish-brown, a slightly darker color than venous blood.\nAbout half of menstrual fluid is blood. This blood contains sodium, calcium, phosphate, iron, and chloride, the extent of which depends on the woman. As well as blood, the fluid consists of cervical mucus, vaginal secretions, and endometrial tissue. Vaginal fluids in menses mainly contribute water, common electrolytes, organ moieties, and at least 14 proteins, including glycoproteins.\nMany women and girls notice blood clots during menstruation. These appear as clumps of blood that may look like tissue. If there was a miscarriage or a stillbirth, examination under a microscope can confirm if it was endometrial tissue or pregnancy tissue (products of conception) that was shed. Sometimes menstrual clots or shed endometrial tissue is incorrectly thought to indicate an early-term miscarriage of an embryo. An enzyme called plasmin \u2013 contained in the endometrium \u2013 tends to inhibit the blood from clotting.\nThe amount of iron lost in menstrual fluid is relatively small for most women. In one study, premenopausal women who exhibited symptoms of iron deficiency were given endoscopies. 86% of them actually had gastrointestinal disease and were at risk of being misdiagnosed simply because they were menstruating. Heavy menstrual bleeding, occurring monthly, can result in anemia.\nSide effects.\nCramps.\nIn most women, various physical changes are brought about by fluctuations in hormone levels during the menstrual cycle. This includes muscle contractions of the uterus (menstrual cramping) that can precede or accompany menstruation. Many women experience painful cramps, also known as dysmenorrhea, during menstruation. Among adult women, 2%\u201328% have pain severe enough to affect daily activity. Severe symptoms that disrupt daily activities and functioning may be diagnosed as premenstrual dysphoric disorder. These symptoms can be severe enough to affect a person's performance at work, school, and in everyday activities in a small percentage of women.\nWhen severe pelvic pain and bleeding suddenly occur or worsen during a cycle, this could be due to ectopic pregnancy and spontaneous abortion. This is checked by using a pregnancy test, ideally as soon as unusual pain begins, because ectopic pregnancies can be life\u2011threatening.\nThe most common treatment for menstrual cramps are non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). NSAIDs can be used to reduce moderate to severe pain, and all appear similar. About 1 in 5 women do not respond to NSAIDs and require alternative therapy, such as simple analgesics or heat pads. Other medications for pain management include aspirin or paracetamol and combined oral contraceptives. Although combined oral contraceptives may be used, there is insufficient evidence for the efficacy of intrauterine progestogens.\nOne review found tentative evidence that acupuncture may be useful, at least in the short term. Another review found insufficient evidence to determine an effect.\nInteractions with other conditions.\nKnown interactions between the menstrual cycle and certain health conditions include:\nSexual activity.\nSexual feelings and behaviors change during the menstrual cycle. Before and during ovulation, high levels of estrogen and androgens result in women having a relatively increased interest in sexual activity, and relatively lower interest directly prior to and during menstruation. Unlike other mammals, women may show interest in sexual activity across all days of the menstrual cycle, regardless of fertility.\nThere is no reliable scientific evidence that would advise against sexual intercourse during menstruation based on medical grounds.\nFertility aspects.\nPeak fertility (the time with the highest likelihood of pregnancy resulting from sexual intercourse) occurs during just a few days of the cycle: usually two days before and two days after the ovulation date. This corresponds to the second and the beginning of the third week in a 28-day cycle. This fertile window varies from woman to woman, just as the ovulation date often varies from cycle to cycle for the same woman. A variety of methods have been developed to help individual women estimate the relatively fertile and the relatively infertile days in the cycle; these systems are called fertility awareness.\nMenstrual disorders.\nInfrequent or irregular ovulation is called \"oligoovulation\". The absence of ovulation is called \"anovulation\". Normal menstrual flow can occur without ovulation preceding it: an anovulatory cycle. In some cycles, follicular development may start but not be completed; nevertheless, estrogens will be formed and stimulate the uterine lining. Anovulatory flow resulting from a very thick endometrium caused by prolonged, continued high estrogen levels is called \"estrogen breakthrough bleeding\". Anovulatory bleeding triggered by a sudden drop in estrogen levels is called withdrawal bleeding. Anovulatory cycles commonly occur before menopause (perimenopause) and in women with polycystic ovary syndrome.\nVery little flow (less than 10 ml) is called \"hypomenorrhea\". Regular cycles with intervals of 21 days or fewer are \"polymenorrhea\"; frequent but irregular menstruation is known as \"metrorrhagia\". Sudden heavy flows or amounts greater than 80 ml are termed \"menorrhagia\". Heavy menstruation that occurs frequently and irregularly is \"menometrorrhagia\". The term for cycles with intervals exceeding 35 days is \"oligomenorrhea\". Amenorrhea refers to more than three to six months without menses (while not being pregnant) during a woman's reproductive years. The term for painful periods is \"dysmenorrhea\".\nThere is a wide spectrum of differences in how women experience menstruation. There are several ways that someone's menstrual cycle can differ from the norm:\nExtreme psychological stress can also result in periods stopping. More severe symptoms of anxiety or depression may be signs of premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) which is a depressive disorder.\nDysfunctional uterine bleeding is a hormonally caused bleeding abnormality. Dysfunctional uterine bleeding typically occurs in premenopausal women who do not ovulate normally (i.e. are anovulatory). All these bleeding abnormalities need medical attention; they may indicate hormone imbalances, uterine fibroids, or other problems. As pregnant women may bleed, a pregnancy test forms part of the evaluation of abnormal bleeding.\nWomen who had undergone female genital mutilation (particularly type III- infibulation) a practice common in parts of Africa, may experience menstrual problems, such as slow and painful menstruation, that is caused by the near-complete sealing off of the vagina.\nMenstrual hygiene management.\nMenstrual products (also called \"feminine hygiene\" products) are made to absorb or catch menstrual blood. A number of different products are available \u2013 some are disposable, some are reusable. Where women can afford it, items used to absorb or catch menses are usually commercially manufactured products. Menstruating women manage menstruation primarily by wearing menstrual products such as tampons, napkins or menstrual cups to catch the menstrual blood.\nThe main disposable products (commercially manufactured) include:\nThe main reusable products include:\nDue to poverty, some women cannot afford commercial feminine hygiene products. Instead, they use materials found in the environment or other improvised materials. \"Period poverty\" is a global issue affecting women and girls who do not have access to safe, hygienic sanitary products. In addition, solid waste disposal systems in developing countries are often lacking, which means women have no proper place to dispose used products, such as pads. Inappropriate disposal of used materials also creates pressures on sanitation systems as menstrual hygiene products can create blockages of toilets, pipes and sewers. In the UK research has shown that for women who are allotment growers, access to sanitation for menstrual hygiene management is limited.\nMenstrual suppression.\nDue to hormonal contraception.\nMenstruation can be delayed by the use of progesterone or progestins. For this purpose, oral administration of progesterone or progestin during cycle day 20 has been found to effectively delay menstruation for at least 20 days, with menstruation starting after 2\u20133 days have passed since discontinuing the regimen.\nHormonal contraception affects the frequency, duration, severity, volume, and regularity of menstruation and menstrual symptoms. The most common form of hormonal contraception is the combined birth control pill, which contains both estrogen and progestogen. Although the primary function of the pill is to prevent pregnancy, it may be used to improve some menstrual symptoms and syndromes which affect menstruation, such as polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), endometriosis, adenomyosis, amenorrhea, menstrual cramps, menstrual migraines, menorrhagia (excessive menstrual bleeding), menstruation-related or fibroid-related anemia and dysmenorrhea (painful menstruation) by creating regularity in menstrual cycles and reducing overall menstrual flow.\nUsing the combined birth control pill, it is also possible for a woman to delay or eliminate menstrual periods, a practice called menstrual suppression. Some women do this simply for convenience in the short-term, while others prefer to eliminate periods altogether when possible. This can be done either by skipping the placebo pills, or using an extended cycle combined oral contraceptive pill, which were first marketed in the U.S. in the early 2000s. This continuous administration of active pills without the placebo can lead to the achievement of amenorrhea in 80% of users within 1 year of use.\nDue to breastfeeding.\nBreastfeeding causes negative feedback to occur on pulse secretion of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) and luteinizing hormone (LH). Depending on the strength of the negative feedback, breastfeeding women may experience complete suppression of follicular development, follicular development but no ovulation, or normal menstrual cycles may resume. Suppression of ovulation is more likely when suckling occurs more frequently. The production of prolactin in response to suckling is important to maintaining lactational amenorrhea. On average, women who are fully breastfeeding whose infants suckle frequently experience a return of menstruation at fourteen and a half months postpartum. There is a wide range of response among individual breastfeeding women, however, with some experiencing return of menstruation at two months and others remaining amenorrheic for up to 42 months postpartum.\nSociety and culture.\nEtymology and terminology.\nThe word \"menstruation\" is etymologically related to \"moon\". The terms \"menstruation\" and \"menses\" are derived from the Latin 'month', which in turn relates to the ancient Greek 'moon' and to the roots of the English words \"month\" and \"moon\".\nSome organizations have begun to use the term \"menstruator\" instead of \"menstruating women\", a term that has been in use since at least 2010. \"Menstruator\" is used by activists and scholars in order to \"express solidarity with women who do not menstruate, transgender men who do, and intersexual and genderqueer individuals\". The term can be contentious between different schools of feminist thought; however, the argument is made that since gender identities are lived, the reality is that people of different genders menstruate. The term \"people who menstruate\" is also used.\nTraditions, taboos and education.\nMany religions have menstruation-related traditions, for example: Islam prohibits sexual contact with women during menstruation in the 2nd chapter of the Quran. Some scholars argue that menstruating women are in a state in which they are unable to maintain wudhu, and are therefore prohibited from touching the Arabic version of the Qur'an. In Judaism, a woman during menstruation is called Niddah and may be banned from certain actions. For example, the Jewish Torah prohibits sexual intercourse with a menstruating woman. In Hinduism, menstruating women are traditionally considered ritually impure and given rules to follow. In Zoroastrianism, if a woman's menses did not stop after nine days, it was considered the work of the da\u0113vas.\nMenstruation education is frequently taught in combination with sex education at school in Western countries, although girls may prefer their mothers to be the primary source of information about menstruation and puberty. Information about menstruation is often shared among friends and peers, which may promote a more positive outlook on puberty. The quality of menstrual education in a society determines the accuracy of people's understanding of the process. In many Western countries where menstruation is a taboo subject, girls tend to conceal the fact that they may be menstruating and struggle to ensure that they give no sign of menstruation. Effective educational programs are essential to providing children and adolescents with clear and accurate information about menstruation. Schools can be an appropriate place for menstrual education to take place. Programs led by peers or third-party agencies are another option. Low-income girls are less likely to receive proper sex education on puberty, leading to a decreased understanding of why menstruation occurs and the associated physiological changes that take place. This has been shown to cause the development of a negative attitude towards menstruation.\nSeclusion during menstruation.\nIn some cultures, women were isolated during menstruation due to menstrual taboos. This is because they are seen as unclean, dangerous, or bringing bad luck to those who encounter them. These practices are common in parts of South Asia including India. A 1983 report found women refraining from household chore during this period in India. Chhaupadi is a social practice that occurs in the western part of Nepal for Hindu women, which prohibits a woman from participating in everyday activities during menstruation. Women are considered impure during this time and are kept out of the house and have to live in a shed. Although chhaupadi was outlawed by the Supreme Court of Nepal in 2005, the tradition is slow to change. Women and girls in cultures which practice such seclusion are often confined to menstruation huts, which are places of isolation used by cultures with strong menstrual taboos. The practice has recently come under fire due to related fatalities. Nepal criminalized the practice in 2017 after deaths were reported after the elongated isolation periods, but \"the practice of isolating menstruating women and girls continues.\" Not all cultures villainize menstruation, the Beng people of West Africa consider menstrual blood as sacred and recognize its significance in reproduction.\nBeliefs around synchrony.\nEffects of the moon.\nEven though the average length of the human menstrual cycle is similar to that of the lunar cycle, in modern humans there is no relation between the two. The relationship is believed to be a coincidence. Light exposure does not appear to affect the menstrual cycle in humans. A meta-analysis of studies from 1996 showed no correlation between the human menstrual cycle and the lunar cycle, nor did data analyzed by period-tracking app Clue, submitted by 1.5million women, of 7.5million menstrual cycles; however, the lunar cycle and the average menstrual cycle were found to be basically equal in length.\nCohabitation.\nBeginning in 1971, some research suggested that menstrual cycles of cohabiting women became synchronized (menstrual synchrony). Subsequent research has called this hypothesis into question. A 2013 review concluded that menstrual synchrony likely does not exist.\nWork.\nSome countries, mainly in Asia, have menstrual leave to provide women with either paid or unpaid leave of absence from their employment while they are menstruating. Countries with policies include Japan, Taiwan, Indonesia, and South Korea. The practice is controversial due to concerns that it bolsters the perception of women as weak, inefficient workers, as well as concerns that it is unfair to men, and that it furthers gender stereotypes and the medicalization of menstruation.\nOther mammals.\nMost female mammals have an estrous cycle, but not all have a menstrual cycle that results in menstruation. Menstruation in mammals occurs in some close evolutionary relatives such as chimpanzees.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Jobst was an ambitious and versatile ruler, who in the early 15th century dominated the ongoing struggles within the Luxembourg dynasty and around the German throne.\nLife.\nJobst was presumably born in 1354 in the Moravian residence of Brno, the eldest legitimate son of Margrave John Henry, younger brother of Emperor Charles IV. Wenceslaus IV of Bohemia and his half-brother Sigismund were both Jobst's cousins.\nDesignated heir upon his father's death in 1375, he ruled the Margraviate of Moravia, and would often quarrel with his younger brother Prokop and the Bishops of Olomouc. In 1388, Jobst received the Duchy of Luxembourg, given in pawn by his cousin King Wenceslaus, son of the late Emperor Charles IV. The same year, Jobst also became Prince-elector of Brandenburg, pawned by Sigismund, who focused on his rule over the Kingdom of Hungary. In 1394, Jobst joined the League of Lords, a rebellion of Bohemian nobles around Bo\u010dek II of Pod\u011bbrady against Wenceslaus. He had Wenceslaus arrested at Prague Castle and later taken into custody by the Austrian Starhemberg dynasty at Wildberg. Peace was made at the instigation of Wenceslaus' brothers Sigismund and John of G\u00f6rlitz; however, once released, the king had Jobst expelled from Prague. Sigismund and Jobst signed a mutual inheritance treaty in 1401, but later again fell out with each other.\nAfter the death of King Rupert of Germany in 1410, Jobst was elected successor by four of the seven prince-electors on 1 October, opposing his cousin Sigismund who had already been elected by three electors on 10 September. The deciding vote came from his cousin Wenceslaus in his capacity as King of Bohemia. Though Jobst had the greater support among the electors, he died on 18 January 1411, possibly having been poisoned, which cleared the way for Sigismund's election as King of the Romans and his later coronation as Holy Roman Emperor.\nMarriage.\nJobst married twice: \nIn popular culture.\nA fictionalized Jobst appears in the 2018 video game '. In the game, he is shown with Divish of Talmberg, Hans Capon, Hanush of Leipa, John II of Liechtenstein, and Radzig Kobyla planning on how to defeat Sigismund and free Wenceslaus from captivity.

These include not using any in some situations, usually bearing a symbolic meaning. This can however also be imposed on specific individuals to place them at a practical disadvantage against shod people, if they are excluded from having footwear available or are prohibited from using any. This usually takes place in situations of captivity, such as imprisonment or slavery, where the groups are among other things distinctly divided by whether or not footwear is being worn.\nIn some cultures, people remove their shoes before entering a home. Bare feet are also seen as a sign of humility and respect, and adherents of many religions worship or mourn while barefoot. Some religious communities explicitly require people to remove shoes before they enter holy buildings, such as temples.\nIn several cultures people remove their shoes as a sign of respect towards someone of higher standing. Similarly, deliberately forcing other people to go barefoot while being shod oneself has been used to clearly showcase and convey one's superiority within a setting of power disparity.\nPractitioners of the craft of shoemaking are called shoemakers, cobblers, or cordwainers.\nHistory.\nFootwear has been used by humans since prehistoric times, with paleoclimatology suggesting that they would have been needed in some areas of human settlement by at least 50,000years ago (BP) during the Last Glacial Period. Fossilised tracks have been found on the South Cape Coast, South Africa, that may date to 130,000 BP. Osteologists have found evidence of the effect of footwear on human remains by around 40,000years ago. The oldest shoes so far recovered were found on the Spirit Cave mummy, from Great Basin Desert in Nevada, and dating to approximately 10, 600 BP. Another pair of shoes were recovered by a team under Luther Cressman in Fort Rock Cave, Oregon, US, in 1938. They had been preserved under the Mazama Ash deposited c.\u20095025 BC during the volcanic eruption that formed Crater Lake. In 1999, they were dated to around 10,500\u20139,300 BP. \nGeta (wooden sandles) have been worn in East Asia, at least since the Liangzhu culture (3400\u20132250 BCE). Egyptian butchers sometimes wore platform sandals with thicker soles than usual to raise their feet out of the gore. Wealthier Egyptians also sometimes wore platforms. The Greeks distinguished a great variety of footwear, particularly different styles of sandals. The heeled cothurnus was part of the standard costume for tragedians, and the effeminate soccus for comedians. Going barefoot, however, was frequently lauded: Spartan boys undergoing military training, Socrates, and Olympic athletes all went without shoes most of the time. Similarly, ancient China considered footwear an important aspect of civilization\u2014particularly embroidered slippers\u2014but often depicted Taoist immortals and gods like Xuanwu barefoot. The Book of Exodus records Moses reverentially removing his shoes at Mount Sinai and the priests likewise went barefoot at the Temple of Solomon before Babylonian customs prevailed and entering houses of worship in footwear became common in Judaism and Christianity.\nThe Etruscans experienced several footwear trends, including the prominently pointed shoe or boot now known as the calceus repandus. The Romans saw clothing and footwear as unmistakable signs of power and status in society. Patricians typically wore dyed and ornamented shoes of tanned leather with their togas or armor, while plebeians wore rawhide or hobnail boots and slaves were usually required to be barefoot. These class distinctions in footwear seem to have lessened during the imperial period, however, as the emperors appropriated more and more symbols of high status for themselves. The Romans were the earliest people currently known to have shaped their right and left shoes distinctly during creation, rather than pulling them tight and allowing them to wear into shape. The Catholic patron saints of shoemaking\u2014Crispin and Crispinian\u2014were martyred during the Diocletianic Persecution.\nIn medieval Europe, leather shoes and boots became more common. At first most were simply pieces of leather sewn together and then held tight around the foot with a toggle or drawstring. This developed into the turnshoe, where the sole and upper were sewn together and then turned inside-out to hide and protect the seam and improve water resistance. From the reign of Charlemagne, Byzantine fashions began to influence the west and the pontificalia of the popes and other bishops began to feature greater luxury, including embroidered silk and velvet slippers. By the High Middle Ages, fashion trends periodically prompted sumptuary taxes or regulations and church condemnation for vanity. The 12th-century pigache and 14th- and 15th-century poulaine had elongated toes, often stuffed to maintain their shape. Around the same time, several mendicant orders began practicing discalceation as an aspect of their vows of humility and poverty, going entirely barefoot at all times or only wearing sandals in any weather. From the 1480s, the poulaine was replaced by the duckbill, which had a flat front but soon became impractically wide. The stiff hose of the era usually required fairly soft footwear, which in turn was easier to damage in the dirt and muck of the street and outdoors. This led many people to use wooden-soled calopedes, pattens, or galoshes, overshoes that served as a platform while walking. Particularly in Venice, these platforms were combined with the shoe to make chopines, sometimes so awkwardly high that the wearer required servants to help support them. (Turkish sources, meanwhile, credit the chopines directly to the nalins worn in Ottoman baths and whose height was considered to be a marker of status.)\nBy the early modern period, the development of better socks and less stiff hose allowed European footwear to become firmer and more durable. Welting was developed, using a narrow band of leather between the uppers and sole to improve appearance and comfort, increase water resistance, and simplify repair, particularly resoling worn shoes. Beginning with the 1533 marriage of the 14-year-old Florentine Catherine de Medici to Prince Henry of France, both male and female royalty and nobles began wearing high heels, giving rise to the expression \"well heeled\". This was done sometimes for display or appearance and sometimes as an aid to riding in stirrups. For the most part, male footwear was more ornate and expensive because women's feet were usually covered by the large dresses of the era. Shoe fetishism was first publicized in the work of Nicolas-Edme R\u00e9tif in prerevolutionary France. 17th-century Cavalier boots developed into upper-class fashion and into sailing boots prized by fishermen and pirates before being replaced as military gear by the 18th-century Hessian and 19th-century Wellington boot. In Ming and Qing China, foot binding led to the development of lotus shoes for Han women and then flowerpot shoes for the Manchu women who wanted to emulate the characteristic walk of women with bound feet without undergoing the process themselves. In Africa, North America, and Spanish and Portuguese South America, slave codes often mandated slaves should be barefoot at all times without exception. Following its independence, the American South was an exception. Its demand for masses of low-quality shoes for its slaves was met by workshops in Boston, Philadelphia, and New York, a dependence that later hobbled the Confederate Army during the Civil War and became responsible in legend for the decisive Battle of Gettysburg. \nAmid the Industrial Revolution, John Adam Dagyr's introduction of assembly line production and tight quality control to the \"ten-footer\" workshops in Lynn, Massachusetts, US, around 1760 is sometimes credited as the first shoe factory. However, although mechanized textile mills greatly reduced the price of proper socks, each step of the shoemaking process still needed to be done by hand in a slowly optimized putting-out system. The first mechanized systems\u2014developed by Marc Isambard Brunel in 1810 to supply boots to the British Army amid the Napoleonic Wars\u2014failed commercially as soon as the wars were over because the demobilized soldiers reduced the price of manual labor. John Nichols's 1850 adaptation of Howe and Singer's sewing machines to handle binding uppers to soles and the Surinamese immigrant Jan Ernst Matzeliger's 1880 invention of an automatic lasting machine finally allowed true industrialization, taking the productivity of individual workers from 20 or 50 pairs a day to as many as 700, halving prices, and briefly making Lynn the center of world shoe production. As late as 1865, most men in the industry identified in the census and city directory as general purpose \"cordwainers\" or \"shoemakers\"; by 1890, they were almost universally described as \"shoe workers\" or\u2014more often\u2014by the specific name of their work within the industry: \"edgesetter\", \"heel trimmer\", \"McKay machine operator\". Many were replaced by cheaper immigrants; the Czech Tom\u00e1\u0161 Ba\u0165a joined these workers at Lynn in 1904 and then returned to his own factory in Zl\u00edn, Moravia, mechanizing and rationalizing its production while guiding the factory town that developed into a garden city.\nBy the early 20th century, vulcanization had led to the development of plimsolls, deck shoes, rubber boots, galoshes, and waders. The prevalence of trench foot in World War I focused attention on the importance of providing of adequate footwear in following conflicts, although this was not always possible. Millions of Chinese soldiers in both the NRA and PLA were obliged to use straw and rope shoes to allow easy replacement on long marches during both World War II and the following civil war, contributing to disease and desertion, particularly among the Nationalists. Following the world wars, the increasing importance of professional sports greatly popularized a variety of athletic shoes, particularly sneakers. Major brands such as Converse, Adidas, and Nike used celebrity endorsements from Chuck Taylor, Michael Jordan, Lionel Messi, and others to promote their products. Fashion houses periodically prompted new trends in women's and high-end fashion. In particular, while working for Christian Dior, Roger Vivier popularized the stiletto heel in 1954. (Men's dress shoes have tended to retain 19th-century British looks such as the Oxford shoe and loafers.) Various subcultures have employed distinctive footwear as part of their identity, including winklepickers, Doc Martens, and skate shoes.\nThe international trade in footwear was at first chiefly restricted to American exports to Europe and Europe's exports to its various colonial empires. Assisted by the Marshall Plan after World War II, Italy became the major shoe exporting country in the 1950s. It was joined in the 1960s by Japan, which offshored its production to Taiwan, South Korea, and Hong Kong as its own labor became too expensive. In their turn, the Hong Kong manufacturers began moving production to Guangdong in mainland China almost immediately after the establishment of Deng Xiaoping's Opening Up Policy in the early 1980s. Competitors were soon forced to follow suit, including removal of Taiwanese and Korean production to Fujian and to Wenzhou in southern Zhejiang. Similarly, amid Perestroika and the Fall of Communism, Italy dismantled its domestic industry, outsourcing its work to Eastern Europe, which proved less dependable than the Chinese and further eroded their market share. Beginning around the year 2000, China has constantly produced more than half of the world's shoes. As of 2021, footwear is the 30th most traded category internationally; but, while China produces well over 60% of exported footwear, it currently earns less than 36% of the value of the total trade owing to the continuing importance of American, German, and other brands in the North American and European markets.\nMaterials.\nModern footwear is usually made of leather or plastic, and rubber. In fact, leather was one of the original materials used for the first versions of a shoe. The soles can be made of rubber or plastic, sometimes with the addition of a sheet of metal on the inside. Roman sandals had sheets of metal on their soles so that they would not bend out of shape.\nIn more recent times, footwear suppliers such as Nike have begun to source environmentally friendly materials. \nComponents.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nFootwear industry.\nIn Europe, recent decades have seen a decline in the footwear industry. While about 27,000 firms were in business in 2005, only 21,700 remained in 2009. Not only have these firms decreased in number, but direct employment has also reduced within the sector.\nIn the U.S., the annual footwear industry revenue was $48 billion in 2012. In 2015, there were about 29,000 shoe stores in the U.S. and the shoe industry employed about 189,000 people. Due to rising imports, these numbers are also declining. The only way of staying afloat in the shoe market is to establish a presence in niche markets.\nSafety of footwear products.\nTo ensure high quality and safety of footwear, manufacturers have to make sure all products comply to existing and relevant standards. By producing footwear in accordance with national and international regulations, potential risks can be minimized and the interest of both textile manufacturers and consumers can be protected.\nThe following standards/regulations apply to footwear products:\nImpressions.\nFootwear can create two types of impressions: two-dimensional and three-dimensional impressions. When footwear places material onto a solid surface, it creates a two-dimensional impression. These types of impressions can be made with a variety of substances, like dirt and sand. When footwear removes material from a soft surface, it creates a three-dimensional impression. These types of impressions can be made in a variety of soft substances, like snow and dirt. Two-dimensional impressions also differ from three-dimensional impressions because the latter demonstrate length, width, and depth whereas two-dimensional impressions only demonstrate the first two aspects.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It was written and illustrated between c.\u20091304 when the main part was completed, and c.\u20091340 with the addenda.\nThe codex was produced in Z\u00fcrich (Switzerland), for the Manesse family.\nThe manuscript is \"the most beautifully illumined German manuscript in centuries\"; its 137 miniatures are a series of \"portraits\" depicting each poet.\nIt is currently housed in the Heidelberg University Library.\nIn 2023, Codex Manesse was admitted to UNESCO's Memory of the World.\nContents.\nThe Codex Manesse is an anthology of the works of a total of about 135 minnesingers of the mid 12th to early 14th century.\nFor each poet, a portrait is shown, followed by the text of their works.\nThe entries are ordered approximately by the social status of the poets, starting with the Holy Roman Emperor Henry VI, Kings Conradin and Wenceslaus II, down through dukes, counts and knights, to the commoners.\nMost of the poems are \"Minnesang\", but there are also other genres, including fables and Spruchdichtung (didactic poems).\nThe oldest poets represented in the manuscript had been dead for more than a century at the time of its compilations, while others were contemporaries, the latest even late additions of poems written during the early 14th century.\nIn the portraits, some of the nobles are shown in full armour in their heraldic colors and devices (therefore with their faces hidden), often shown as taking part in a joust, or sometimes in single combat with sword and shield, and sometimes in actual battle.\nSome images are motivated by the biography of the person depicted, but some designs just draw their motif from the poet's name (thus, Dietmar is shown riding a mule, since his name can be interpreted as meaning \"people's horse\"), while others draw on imagery from their lyrics (Walther von der Vogelweide is shown in a thoughtful pose which exactly matches the description of himself in one of his most famous songs).\nManuscript history.\nThe compilation of the codex was patronized by the Manesse family of Z\u00fcrich, presumably by R\u00fcdiger II Manesse (born before 1252, died after 1304). The house of Manesse declined in the late 14th century, selling their castle in 1393. The fate of the codex during the 15th century is unknown, but by the 1590s it had passed into possession of baron Johann Philipp of Hohensax (two of whose forebears are portrayed in the codex, on foll. 48v and 59v). In 1604, Melchior Goldast published excerpts of its didactic texts.\nAfter 1657 it was in the French royal library, from which it passed to the Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale, where the manuscript was studied by Jacob Grimm in 1815. In 1888, after long bargaining, it was sold to the Bibliotheca Palatina of Heidelberg, following a public subscription headed by William I and Otto von Bismarck.\nThe first critical editions of the \"Codex Manesse\" appeared in the early nineteenth century. The codex is frequently referred to by Minnesang scholars and in editions simply by the abbreviation \"C\", introduced by Karl Lachmann, who used \"A\" and \"B\" for the two main earlier Minnesang codices (the \"Kleine Heidelberger Liederhandschrift\" and the \"Weingartner Liederhandschrift\" respectively).\nTwo leaves of a 15th-century copy of the manuscript, called the \"Tro\u00dfsche Fragment\" (\"Tross Fragment\"), which were held in the Berlin State Library but went missing in 1945, are now in the Jagiellonian Library in Krak\u00f3w (Berol. mgq 1146).\nModern reception.\nThe possibility that the compiler was the \"Minnesinger\" Johannes Hadlaub provided the subject of a poetic novella, \"Hadlaub\" (in the \"Z\u00fcricher Novellen\", 1878), by Gottfried Keller.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

As an example, the Kyrgyz people used horses as the principal currency unit, and gave small change in lambskins; the lambskins may be suitable for numismatic study, but the horses are not. Many objects have been used for centuries, such as cowry shells, precious metals, cocoa beans, large stones, and gems.\nEtymology.\nFirst attested in English in 1829, the word \"numismatics\" comes from the adjective \"numismatic\", meaning 'of coins'. It was borrowed in 1792 from French , itself a derivation from Late Latin , genitive of , a variant of meaning 'coin'. is a latinisation of the Greek () which means 'current coin/custom', which derives from () 'to hold or own as a custom or usage, to use customarily', in turn from () 'usage, custom', ultimately from () 'to dispense, divide, assign, keep, hold'.\nHistory of money.\nThroughout its history, money itself has been made to be a scarce good. Many materials have been used to form money, from naturally scarce precious metals and cowry shells through cigarettes to entirely artificial money, called fiat money, such as banknotes. Many complementary currencies use time as a unit of measure, using mutual credit accounting that keeps the balance of money intact.\nModern money (along with most ancient money) is essentially a token \u2013 an abstraction. Paper currency is perhaps the most common type of contemporary physical money. However, goods such as gold or silver retain many of the essential properties of money, such as price fluctuation and limited supply, although these goods are not controlled by one single authority.\nHistory.\nCoin collecting may have possibly existed in ancient times. Augustus gave \"coins of every device, including old pieces of the kings and foreign money\" as Saturnalia gifts.\nPetrarch, who wrote in a letter that he was often approached by vine diggers with old coins asking him to buy or to identify the ruler, is credited as the first Renaissance collector. Petrarch presented a collection of Roman coins to Emperor Charles IV in 1355.\nThe first book on coins was \"De Asse et Partibus\" (1514) by Guillaume Bud\u00e9. During the early Renaissance ancient coins were collected by European royalty and nobility. Collectors of coins were Pope Boniface VIII, Emperor Maximilian of the Holy Roman Empire, Louis XIV of France, Ferdinand I, Elector Joachim II of Brandenburg who started the Berlin coin cabinet and Henry IV of France to name a few. Numismatics is called the \"Hobby of Kings\", due to its most esteemed founders.\nProfessional societies organised in the 19th century. The Royal Numismatic Society was founded in 1836 and immediately began publishing the journal that became the \"Numismatic Chronicle\". The American Numismatic Society was founded in 1858 and began publishing the \"American Journal of Numismatics\" in 1866.\nIn 1931 the British Academy launched the Sylloge Nummorum Graecorum publishing collections of Ancient Greek coinage. The first volume of Sylloge of Coins of the British Isles was published in 1958.\nIn the 20th century, coins gained recognition as archaeological objects, and scholars such as Guido Bruck of the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna realized their value in providing a temporal context and the difficulty that curators faced when identifying worn coins using classical literature. After World War II in Germany, a project, \"Fundm\u00fcnzen der Antike\" (Coin finds of the Classical Period) was launched to register every coin found within Germany. This idea found successors in many countries.\nIn the United States, the US Mint established a coin cabinet in 1838 when chief coiner Adam Eckfeldt donated his personal collection. William E. Du Bois' \"Pledges of History...\" (1846) describes the cabinet.\nC. Wyllys Betts' \"American colonial history illustrated by contemporary medals\" (1894) set the groundwork for the study of American historical medals.\nHelen Wang's \"A short history of Chinese numismatics in European languages\" (2012\u20132013) gives an outline history of Western countries' understanding of Chinese numismatics. Lyce Jankowski's \"Les amis des monnaies\" is an in-depth study of Chinese numismatics in China in the 19th century.\nProfessional organizations.\nThe IAPN is an international organization of professional coin dealers and numismatic firms. It was founded in 1951 in Geneva and aims to promote high ethical standards in the numismatic trade, support research projects, and provide expertise on issues such as counterfeiting. Membership requires sponsorship and several years of professional activity in the numismatic field.\nThe American Numismatic Association (ANA) is a United States-based nonprofit organization founded in 1891 that supports the study and collection of coins, paper money, and medals. It offers educational programs, publishes numismatic research, hosts conventions and exhibitions, and maintains a library and museum. Membership is open to the public.\nModern.\nModern numismatics is the study of the coins of the mid-17th century onward, the period of machine-struck coins. Their study serves more the need of collectors than historians, and it is more often successfully pursued by amateur aficionados than by professional scholars. The focus of modern numismatics frequently lies in the research of production and use of money in historical contexts using mint or other records in order to determine the relative rarity of the coins they study. Varieties, mint-made errors, the results of progressive die wear, mintage figures, and even the sociopolitical context of coin mintings are also matters of interest.\nSubfields.\nExonumia (UK English: Paranumismatica) is the study of coin-like objects such as token coins and medals, and other items used in place of legal currency or for commemoration. This includes elongated coins, encased coins, souvenir medallions, tags, badges, counter-stamped coins, wooden nickels, credit cards, and other similar items. It is related to numismatics proper (concerned with coins which have been legal tender), and many coin collectors are also exonumists.\nNotaphily is the study of paper money or banknotes. It is believed that people have been collecting paper money for as long as it has been in use. However, people only started collecting paper money systematically in Germany in the 1920s, particularly the \"Serienscheine\" (Series notes) Notgeld. The turning point occurred in the 1970s when notaphily was established as a separate area by collectors. At the same time, some developed countries such as the United States, Germany, and France began publishing their respective national catalogs of paper money, which represented major points of reference literature.\nScripophily is the study and collection of companies' shares and bonds certificates. It is an area of collecting due to both the inherent beauty of some historical documents as well as the interesting historical context of each document. Some stock certificates are excellent examples of engraving. Occasionally, an old stock document will be found that still has value as stock in a successor company.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The term originated as the collective term for products of which a maker or seller is termed a hosier; and those products are also known generically as hose. The term is also used for all types of knitted fabric, and its thickness and weight is defined by denier or opacity. Lower denier measurements of 5 to 15 describe a hose which may be sheer in appearance, whereas styles of 40 and above are dense, with little to no light able to come through on 100 denier items.\nEtymology.\nThe word hosiery is a morphological derivation of the Anglo Saxon word \"hosa\", which meant a woven garment for the lower body and legs.\nOverview.\nThe first references to hosiery can be found in the works of Hesiod, where Romans are said to have used leather or cloth in forms of strips to cover their lower body parts. Even the Egyptians are speculated to have used hosiery, as socks have been found in certain tombs.\nMost hosiery garments are made by knitting methods. Modern hosiery is usually tight-fitting by virtue of stretchy fabrics and meshes. Older forms include binding to achieve a tight fit. Due to its close fit, most hosiery can be worn as an undergarment, but it is more commonly worn as a combined under/outer garment.\nHosiery garments are the product of hosiery fabric produced from hosiery yarn. Like the yarn used for making woven fabric, hosiery yarn comes from a separate spinning (yarn making) process, and is used with circular knitting machines to form fabric. One or more hosiery yarn is used to make knitted or hosiery fabric, and garments produced out of this are generally referred to as hosiery garments.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "38214", "revid": "244946", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=38214", "title": "The Illuminatus! Trilogy", "text": "Series of novels by Robert Shea and Robert Anton Wilson\nThe Illuminatus! Trilogy is a series of three novels by American writers Robert Shea and Robert Anton Wilson, first published in 1975. The trilogy is a satirical, postmodern, science fiction\u2013influenced adventure story; a drug-, sex-, and magic-laden trek through a number of conspiracy theories, both historical and imaginary, related to the authors' version of the Illuminati. The narrative often switches between third- and first-person perspectives in a nonlinear narrative. It is thematically dense, covering topics like counterculture, numerology, and Discordianism.\nThe trilogy comprises three parts which contain five books and appendices: The Eye in the Pyramid (first two books), The Golden Apple (third and part of fourth book), Leviathan (part of fourth and all of fifth book, and the appendices). The parts were first published as three separate volumes starting in September 1975. In 1984 they were published as an omnibus edition and are now more commonly reprinted in the latter form. In 1986 the trilogy won the Prometheus Hall of Fame Award. The authors further dealt with its themes in fiction and non-fiction works.\n\"Illuminatus!\" has been adapted for the stage and as an audio book, and has influenced several modern writers, artists, musicians, and game-makers. The popularity of the word \"fnord\" and the 23 enigma can both be attributed to the trilogy.\nNarrative.\nThe plot meanders between the thoughts, hallucinations and inner voices, real and imagined, of its many characters\u2014ranging from a squirrel to a New York City detective to an artificial intelligence\u2014as well as through time (past, present, and future), and sometimes in mid-sentence. Much of the back story is explained via dialogue between characters, who recount unreliable, often mutually contradictory, versions of their supposed histories. There are even parts in the book in which the narrative reviews and jokingly deconstructs the work itself.\nPlot summary.\nThe trilogy's story begins with an investigation by two New York City police detectives (Saul Goodman and Barney Muldoon) into the bombing of \"Confrontation\", a leftist magazine, and the disappearance of its editor, Joe Malik. Discovering the magazine's investigation into the assassinations of John F. Kennedy, Robert F. Kennedy, and Martin Luther King Jr., the two follow a trail of memos that suggest the involvement of powerful secret societies. They slowly become drawn into a web of conspiracy theories. Meanwhile, the magazine's reporter, George Dorn\u2014having been turned loose without support deep in right-wing Mad Dog, Texas\u2014is arrested for drug possession. He is jailed and physically threatened, at one point hallucinating about his own execution. The prison is bombed and he is rescued by the Discordians, led by the enigmatic Hagbard Celine, captain of a golden submarine. Hagbard represents the Discordians in their eternal battle against the Illuminati, the conspiratorial organization that secretly controls the world. He finances his operations by smuggling illicit substances.\nThe plot meanders around the globe to such locations as Las Vegas (where an epidemic of deadly mutated anthrax secretly developed by the U.S. government has been accidentally unleashed); Atlantis (where Howard, the talking porpoise, and his porpoise aides help Hagbard battle the Illuminati); Chicago (where someone resembling John Dillinger was killed many years ago); and to the island of Fernando Poo (the location of the next great Cold War standoff between the Soviet Union, China, and the United States).\nThe evil scheme uncovered late in the tale is an attempt to \"immanentize the eschaton\", a secret scheme of the \"American Medical Association\", an evil rock band, to bring about a mass human sacrifice, the purpose of which is the release of enough \"life-energy\" to give eternal life to a select group of initiates, including Adolf Hitler. The AMA are revealed to be four siblings (last name Saure) who comprise four of the five mysterious Illuminati Primi. The identity of the fifth remains unknown for much of the trilogy. The first European \"Woodstock\" festival, held at Ingolstadt, Bavaria (place of origin of the \"real\" historical Illuminati), is the chosen location for the sacrifice of the unwary victims, via the reawakening of hibernating Nazi battalions from the bottom of nearby (fictitious) Lake Totenkopf (a literal translation of contemporary American English \"dead head\"). The plot is foiled when, with the help of a 50-foot-tall incarnation of the goddess Eris, the four members of the AMA are killed: Wilhelm is killed by the monstrous alien being Yog-Sothoth, Wolfgang is shot by John Dillinger, Winifred is drowned by porpoises, and Werner is trapped in a sinking car.\nThe major protagonists, now gathered together on board the submarine, are menaced by the Leviathan, a giant, pyramid-shaped single-cell sea monster that has been growing in size for hundreds of millions of years. The over-the-top nature of this encounter leads some of the characters to question whether they are merely characters in a book. This metafictional note is swiftly rejected (or ignored) as they turn their attention to the monster again. The threat is neutralized by offering up their onboard computer as something for the creature to communicate with to ease its loneliness. Finally Hagbard manages to defeat the Illuminati Primi and travels to Alpha Centauri in 1999.\nTitles.\nThe titles of the three volumes or parts (the front covers were titled \"Illuminatus! Part I The Eye in the Pyramid\", \"Illuminatus! Part II The Golden Apple\" and \"Illuminatus! Part III Leviathan\") refer to recurring symbols of elements of the plot.\n\"The Eye in the Pyramid\" refers to the Eye of Providence, which in the novel represents particularly the Bavarian Illuminati, and makes a number of appearances (for example, as an altar and a tattoo).\n\"The Golden Apple\" refers to the golden apple of discord, from the Greek myth of the Judgement of Paris. In the trilogy it is used as the symbol of the Legion of Dynamic Discord, a Discordian group; the golden apple makes a number of appearances, for example, on the cover, on a black flag, and as an emblem on a uniform.\n\"Leviathan\" refers to the Biblical sea monster Leviathan, which is a potential danger to Hagbard's submarine \"Leif Erickson\" (from the name of the Icelandic discoverer of America). It also refers to Thomas Hobbes' seminal work of political philosophy, \"Leviathan\", as a metaphor for an all-encompassing, authoritarian state \u2013 a common metaphor used in libertarian discourse.\nPublishing history.\nThe trilogy was originally written between 1969 and 1971 while Wilson and Shea were both associate editors for \"Playboy\" magazine. As part of the role, they dealt with correspondence from the general public on the subject of civil liberties, much of which involved paranoid rants about imagined conspiracies. The pair began to write a novel with the premise that \"all these nuts are right, and every single conspiracy they complain about really exists\". In a 1980 interview given to the science fiction magazine \"Starship\", Wilson suggested the novel was also an attempt to build a myth around Discordianism:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThere was no specific division of labor in the collaborative writing process, although Shea's writing tended towards melodrama, while Wilson's parts tended towards satire. Wilson states in a 1976 interview conducted by Neal Wilgus:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nAccording to Ken Campbell, who created a stage adaptation of \"Illuminatus!\" with Chris Langham, the writing process was treated as a game of one-upmanship between the two co-authors, and was an enjoyable experience for both:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;They had a lot of access to research staff. And so under the guise that it would be helpful writing articles for \"Playboy\" (I don't think it was really) they got into the Illuminati. Wilson would bung these memos to Shea as material came in from the researchers\u2014like the memos in the book. When they got to memo 23, Shea said, \"If we imagine a New York cop came across these memos, I think we've got the basis for a fine thriller!\" So the next one Wilson wrote was episode one of the thriller. Shea replied with episode two. They were playing a game really. Like, I bet you can't continue this! The answer is, \"No I can't, so we'll continue with this!\"\nThe unusual end product did not appeal to publishers, and it took several years before anybody agreed to take it on. According to Wilson, the division of \"Illuminatus!\" into three parts was a commercial decision of the publisher, not the authors, who had conceived it as a single continuous volume. Shea and Wilson were required to cut 500 pages to reduce printing costs on what was seen as a risky venture, although Wilson states that most of the ideas contained therein made it into his later works. The idea that the top secrets of the Illuminati were cut from the books because the printer decided to trim the number of pages is a joke typical of the trilogy.\nDell Publishing first released these individual editions (with covers illustrated by Carlos Victor Ochagavia) in the United States in 1975, to favorable reviews and some commercial success. It became a cult favorite but did not cross over into large mainstream sales. In Britain, Sphere Books released the individual editions (with different cover art by Tony Roberts) in 1976. The individual editions sold steadily until 1984, when the trilogy was republished in a single omnibus volume for the first time. This collected edition lost the \"what has gone before\" introduction to \"The Golden Apple\" and the \"Prologue\" to \"Leviathan\". Some of the material in that foreword, such as the self-destruct mynah birds (taught to say \"Here, kitty-kitty-kitty!\"), appears nowhere else in the trilogy, likely a result of the 500 pages of cuts demanded by Dell. The omnibus edition gave a new lease on life to flagging sales, and became the most commonly available form of the trilogy from then on.\nThe trilogy was translated and published in German, again both as separate volumes (the three covers of which formed a triptych) and an omnibus. The face of J. R. \"Bob\" Dobbs was split across the first two volumes, despite the Church of the SubGenius not being featured in the novel (although Wilson had become a member). The Church was founded by \"Illuminatus!\" fans, and the image of \"Bob\" is widely considered to be a representation of Wilson himself.\nThemes.\n\"The Illuminatus! Trilogy\" covers a wide range of subjects throughout the book. These include discussions about mythology, current events, conspiracy theories and counterculture.\nConspiracies.\nAlthough the many conspiracy theories in the book are imaginary, these are mixed in with enough truth to make them seem plausible. For example, the title of the first book, \"The Eye in the Pyramid\", refers to the Eye of Providence, a mystical symbol which derives from the ancient Egyptian Eye of Horus and is erroneously claimed to be the symbol of the Bavarian Illuminati. Some of America's founding fathers are alleged by conspiracy theorists to have been members of this sect.\nThe books are loaded with references to the Illuminati, the Argenteum Astrum, many and various world domination plans, conspiracy theories and pieces of gnostic knowledge. Many of the odder conspiracies in the book are taken from unpublished letters to \"Playboy\" magazine, where the authors were working as associate editors while they wrote the novels. Among the oddest was the suggestion that Adam Weishaupt, founder of the Bavarian Illuminati, killed George Washington and took on his identity as President of the United States. This is often noted in Illuminati-conspiracy discussion.\nFnord.\nThe nonsense word \"fnord\", invented by the writers of \"Principia Discordia\", is given a specific and sinister meaning in the trilogy. It is a subliminal message technique, a word that the majority of the population since early childhood has been trained to ignore (and trained to forget both the training and that they are ignoring it), but which they associate with a vague sense of unease. Upon seeing the word, readers experience a panic reaction. They then subconsciously suppress all memories of having seen the word, but the sense of panic remains. They therefore associate the unease with the news story they are reading. Fnords are scattered liberally in the text of newspapers and magazines, causing fear and anxiety in those following current events. There are no fnords in the advertisements, thus encouraging a consumerist society. \"Fnord\" magazine equated the fnords with a generalized effort to control and brainwash the populace. To \"see the fnords\" would imply an attempt to wrestle back individual autonomy, similar to the idea of , especially since the word fnord was actually said to appear between regular lines of text.\nThe word makes its first appearance in \"The Illuminatus! Trilogy\" without any explanation during an acid trip by Dr. Ignotum Per Ignotius and Joe Malik: \"The only good fnord is a dead fnord\". Several other unexplained appearances follow. Only much later in the story is the secret revealed, when Malik is hypnotized by Hagbard Celine to recall suppressed memories of his first-grade teacher conditioning his class to ignore the fnords: \"If you don't see the fnord it can't eat you, don't see the fnord, don't see the fnord...\"\nNumerology.\nNumerology is given great credence by many of the characters, with the Law of Fives in particular being frequently mentioned. Hagbard Celine states the Law of Fives in Appendix Gimmel: \"All phenomena are directly or indirectly related to the number five.\" He gives away the secret when he adds, \"given enough ingenuity on the part of the demonstrator. That's the very model of what a scientific law must always be: a statement about how the human mind relates to the cosmos.\" (Late in the work, Celine demonstrates the meaninglessness of the Law of Fives by showing another character a picture of a young girl with six fingers on each hand and saying, \"If we were all like her, there'd be a Law of Sixes.\") Another character, Simon Moon, identifies what he calls the \"23 synchronicity principle\", which he credits William S. Burroughs as having discovered. Both laws involve finding significance in the appearance of the number, and in its \"presen[ce] esoterically because of its conspicuous exoteric absence.\" One of the reasons Moon finds 23 significant is because \"All the great anarchists died on the 23rd day of some month or other.\" He also identifies a \"23/17 phenomenon.\" They are both tied to the Law of Fives, he explains, because 2 + 3 = 5, and 1 + 7 = 8 = 2\u00b3. Robert Anton Wilson claimed in a 1988 interview that \"23 is a part of the cosmic code. It's connected with so many synchronicities and weird coincidences that it must mean something, I just haven't figured out yet what it means!\".\nCounterculture.\nThe books were written at the height of the late 1960s, and are infused with the popular counterculture ideas of that time. For instance, the New Age slogan \"flower power\" is referenced via its German form, \"Ewige Blumenkraft\" (literally \"eternal flower power\"), described by Shea and Wilson as a slogan of the Illuminati, the enemies of the hippie ideal. The book's attitude to New Age philosophies and beliefs are ambiguous. Wilson explained in a later interview: \"I'm some kind of antibody in the New Age movement. on the rewrite we deliberately threw in a couple of references to it, but we had worked out the structure on our own, mostly on the basis of the nut mail that Playboy gets\".\nCognitive dissonance.\nEvery view of reality that is introduced in the story is later derided in some way, whether that view is traditional or iconoclastic. The trilogy is an exercise in cognitive dissonance, with an absurdist plot built of seemingly plausible, if unprovable, components. Ultimately, readers are left to form their own interpretations as to which, if any, of the numerous contradictory viewpoints presented by the characters are valid or plausible, and which are simply satirical gags and shaggy dog jokes. This style of building up a viable belief system, then tearing it down to replace it with another one, was described by Wilson as \"guerrilla ontology\".\nSelf-reference.\nThere are several parts in the book where it reviews and jokingly deconstructs itself. The fictional journalist Epicene Wildeblood at one point is required to critique a book uncannily similar to \"The Illuminatus! Trilogy\":\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;It's a dreadfully long monster of a book, [...] and I certainly won't have time to read it, but I'm giving it a thorough skimming. The authors are utterly incompetent\u2014no sense of style or structure at all. It starts out as a detective story, switches to science-fiction, then goes off into the supernatural, and is full of the most detailed information of dozens of ghastly boring subjects. And the time sequence is all out of order in a very pretentious imitation of Faulkner and Joyce. Worst yet, it has the most raunchy sex scenes, thrown in just to make it sell, I'm sure, and the authors\u2014whom I've never heard of\u2014have the supreme bad taste to introduce real political figures into this mishmash and pretend to be exposing a real conspiracy. You can be sure I won't waste time reading such rubbish.\nSeveral protagonists come to the realization that they are merely fictional characters, or at least begin to question the reality of their situation. George Dorn wonders early on if he \"was in some crazy surrealist movie, wandering from telepathic sheriffs to homosexual assassins, to nympho lady Masons, to psychotic pirates, according to a script written in advance by two acid-heads and a Martian humorist\". Hagbard Celine claims towards the climax that the entire story is a computer-generated synthesis of random conspiracies: \"I can fool the rest of you, but I can't fool the reader. FUCKUP has been working all morning, correlating all the data on this caper and its historical roots, and I programmed him to put it in the form of a novel for easy reading. Considering what a lousy job he does at poetry, I suppose it will be a high-camp novel, intentionally or unintentionally.\"\nAllusions to other works.\nThe novel \"Telemachus Sneezed\" by the character Atlanta Hope with its catchphrase \"What is John Guilt?\" is a spoof of Ayn Rand's \"Atlas Shrugged\", the origin of the character John Galt. Ayn Rand is mentioned by name a few times in \"Illuminatus!\", and her novel is alluded to by Hagbard who says, \"If Atlas can Shrug and Telemachus can Sneeze, why can't Satan Repent?\" Rand is also disparaged in one of the appendices concerning property, ostensibly written by Hagbard, which serves as an explanation of anarchist Pierre-Joseph Proudhon's views on the subject. There are also references to Thomas Pynchon's \"The Crying of Lot 49\" and his \"Gravity's Rainbow\", an equally enormous experimental novel concerning liberty and paranoia that was published two years prior to \"Illuminatus!\" Wilson claims his book was already complete by the time he and Shea read Pynchon's novel (which went on to win several awards), but they then went back and made some modifications to the text before its final publication to allude to Pynchon's work.\nReviews and reputation.\nThe books have received laudatory reviews and comments from \"Playboy\", \"Publishers Weekly\", the American Library Association's \"Booklist\" magazine, \"Philadelphia Daily News\", \"Berkeley Barb\", \"Rolling Stone\" and \"Limit\". \"The Village Voice\" called it \"The ultimate conspiracy book ... the biggest sci-fi-cult novel to come along since \"Dune\" ... hilariously raunchy!\" John White of the \"New Age Journal\" described it as:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\n\"The Fortean Times\" was also enthusiastic, whilst acknowledging the difficulties many readers would have attempting to follow the convoluted plot threads:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Be prepared for streams of consciousness in which not only identity but time and space no longer confine the narrative, which zips up and down time-lines and flashes into other minds with consummate ease [...] A damned good read. Has to be read to be believed (and even then I'm not sure\u2014it really is preposterous in parts).\n\"Illuminatus!\" even garnered some attention outside literary criticism, having several pages devoted to it in a chapter on the American New Right in \"Architects of Fear: Conspiracy Theories and Paranoia in American Politics\" by George Johnson (1983).\nIn more recent years, it was complimented in the bibliography to the \"New Hackers Dictionary\" as a book that can help readers \"understand the hacker mindset.\" The Dictionary described it as:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;An incredible berserko-surrealist rollercoaster of world-girdling conspiracies, intelligent dolphins, the fall of Atlantis, who really killed JFK, sex, drugs, rock'n'roll, and the Cosmic Giggle Factor. [...] The perfect right-brain companion to Hofstadter's \"G\u00f6del, Escher, Bach\".\nIt was also included in the \"Slack Syllabus\" in \"The Official Slacker Handbook\" by Sarah Dunn (1994), a satirical guide aimed at Generation X.\nFollow-ups.\nWilson and Robert Shea went on to become prolific authors. While Shea concentrated mainly on historical novels, Wilson produced over 30 works, mixing fictional novels with nonfiction. Although both authors' later work often elaborated on concepts first discussed in \"Illuminatus!\", the pair never collaborated again. The trilogy inspired a number of direct adaptations, including a stage play and a comic book series, and numerous indirect adaptations that borrowed from its themes.\nShea and Wilson.\nWilson subsequently wrote a number of prequels, sequels and spin-offs based upon the \"Illuminatus!\" concept, including an incomplete pentalogy called \"The Historical Illuminatus Chronicles\", a standalone work entitled \"Masks of the Illuminati\" and \"The Illuminati Papers\", in which several chapters are attributed to the trilogy's characters. Many of Wilson's other works, fictional and nonfictional, also make reference to the Illuminati or the \"Illuminatus!\" books. Several of the characters from \"Illuminatus!\", for example, Markoff Chaney (\"The Midget\") and Epicene Wildeblood, return in Wilson's \"Schr\u00f6dinger's Cat Trilogy\", which also carries on some of its themes. The third book of the \"Cat\" trilogy, \"The Homing Pigeons\", is actually mentioned as a sequel to \"Illuminatus!\" in \"Appendix Mem\". In 1998, Wilson published an encyclopedia of conspiracy theories called \"Everything is Under Control\", which explains the origins of many of the theories mentioned in \"Illuminatus!\".\nWilson and Shea planned to recollaborate on a true sequel, \"Bride of Illuminatus\", taking place in 2026. It was rumored that it would feature a resurrected Winifred Saure (the only female member of the American Medical Association) exerting her influence through virtual reality. Shea died in 1994 before this project came to fruition. An excerpt was published in Robert Anton Wilson's \"Trajectories Newsletter: The Journal of Futurism and Heresy\" in spring 1995. In a 1994 interview for \"FringeWare Review\", Wilson suggested he may even \"do a Son of Illuminatus later\". In \"Intelligence Agents\" by Timothy Leary (1996) he was credited with having already authored \"Son of Illuminatus\" in the 1980s.\nShea never wrote another \"Illuminatus!\"-related book, although many of his later novels include references to the themes of that work. \"Locus\" called his Saracen novels \"deep background for the \"Illuminatus\" trilogy\".\nAdaptations.\nAn audacious proposal by the English experimental theater director Ken Campbell to stage \"Illuminatus!\" in its entirety at The National Theatre in London was met with surprisingly open arms, particularly given its inordinate length: a cycle of five plays\u2014\"The Eye of the Pyramid\", \"Swift Kick Inc.\", \"The Man Who Murdered God\", \"Walpurgisnacht Rock\" and \"Leviathan\"\u2014each consisting of five 23-minute acts. Sir Peter Hall, director of the National at the time, wrote of Campbell in his \"Diaries\", \"He is a total anarchist and impossible to pin down. He more or less said it was a crime to be serious.\"\nThe adaptation became the very first production at the National's Cottesloe Theatre space, running from 4 March to 27 March 1977. It had first opened in Liverpool on 23 November 1976. The first night of the London version featured Robert Anton Wilson, accompanied by Shea, as a naked extra in the witches' sabbat scene. Wilson was delighted with the adaptation, saying: \"I was thunderstruck at what a magnificent job they did in capturing the exact tone and mixture of fantasy and reality in the book. I've come to the conclusion that this isn't literature. It's too late in the day for literature. This is magic!\"\nThe 23-strong cast featured several actors, such as Jim Broadbent, David Rappaport and Chris Langham, who went on to successful film, stage and television careers. Broadbent alone played more than a dozen characters in the play. Bill Drummond designed sets for the show, and it was eventually seen (when it moved to London, with Bill Nighy then joining the cast) by the young Jimmy Cauty. Drummond and Cauty went on to form the \"Illuminatus!\"-inspired electronica band The KLF.\nIn thanks, Wilson dedicated his \"\" (1977) to \"Ken Campbell and the Science-Fiction Theatre Of Liverpool, England.\" The play was later staged in Seattle, Washington in 1978.\nNo film or video exists of the performances at The National Theatre. A full audio recording is available as a limited edition perk in the crowdfunding for the 2014 stage play of Wilson's book \"\", adapted by Daisy Eris Campbell (Ken Campbell's daughter).\nAn attempt was made to adapt the trilogy in comic book form beginning in the 1980s, by \"Eye-n-Apple Productions\" headed by Icarus! Icarus! met with Wilson in 1984 and subsequently obtained permission from Wilson's agent to adapt the trilogy. \"Illuminatus!\" #1 was issued in July 1987, then reissued in substantially revised form later that year by Rip Off Press (who had published the original 4th edition of the \"Principia Discordia\" in 1970).\nA second issue followed in 1990, and a third in March 1991, after which the venture stalled (although several ashcans of the as yet unpublished Fourth Trip were distributed at comic book conventions in the Detroit and Chicago areas between 1991 and 2006).\nInfluence.\nThe 1980s computer hacker Karl Koch was heavily influenced by \"The Illuminatus! Trilogy\". Besides adopting the pseudonym \"Hagbard\" from the character Hagbard Celine, he also named his computer \"FUCKUP\", after a computer designed and built by that character. He was addicted to cocaine and became extremely paranoid, convinced he was fighting the Illuminati like his literary namesake. In 1987 he wrote a rambling seven-page \"hacking manifesto of sorts, complete with his theories on Hagbard Celine and the Illuminati\". The 1998 German motion picture \"23\" told a dramatized version of his story; Robert Anton Wilson appeared as himself.\nA card game, \"Illuminati\", inspired by the trilogy, was created by Steve Jackson Games. Using the \"Illuminatus!\" books as \"spiritual guides but not as actual source material\", it incorporated competing conspiracies of the Bavarian Illuminati and Discordians and others, though no characters or groups specific to the novels. A trading card game () and role-playing game supplement (\"GURPS Illuminati\") followed. The instruction booklets' bibliographies praise the novel and Wilson particularly, calling \"Illuminatus!\" in part \"required reading for any conspiracy buff\". Robert Shea provided a four-paragraph introduction to the rulebook for the Illuminati Expansion Set 1 (1983), in which he wrote, \"Maybe the Illuminati are behind \"this game\". They must be\u2014they are, by definition, behind \"everything\".\" Despite this initial involvement, Wilson later criticized some of these products for exploiting the \"Illuminatus!\" name without paying royalties (taking advantage of what he viewed as a legal loophole).\n\"The Illuminatus! Trilogy\" is steeped with references to the 1960s popular music scene (at one point a list of 200 fictional bands performing at the Walpurgisnacht rock festival is reeled off (including a handful of actual bands of the '60s), and there are numerous references to the famous rock and roll song \"Rock Around the Clock\"), and has influenced many bands and musicians. One of the aliases of anarchic British band The KLF was named after a secret society from the trilogy. They released much of their early material under the name \"The Justified Ancients of Mu Mu\"/\"The JAMMs\", cf. \"The Justified Ancients of Mummu\"/\"The JAMs\" from the trilogy, and much of their work was Discordian in nature. They mirrored the fictional JAMs' gleeful political tactics of causing chaos and confusion by bringing a direct, humorous but nevertheless revolutionary approach to making records. The American band Machines of Loving Grace took the name of a sex act performed by one of the main characters during a Black Mass for the title of their song \"Rite of Shiva\" on their eponymous album. UK chillout maestro Mixmaster Morris also named his band The Irresistible Force after one that appears at the festival in the last part of the trilogy. Together with Coldcut he organised a huge Robert Anton Wilson Memorial Show at the Queen Elizabeth Hall in London on 18 March 2007.\nIn general, \"The Illuminatus! Trilogy\" can be credited with popularizing the genre of conspiracy fiction, a field later mined by authors like Umberto Eco (\"Foucault's Pendulum\"), Charles Cecil () and Dan Brown (\"Angels &amp; Demons\", \"The Da Vinci Code\", \"The Lost Symbol\"), comic book writers like Alan Moore (\"V for Vendetta\", \"From Hell\"), Dave Sim (\"Cerebus\") and Grant Morrison (\"The Invisibles\"), and screenwriters like Chris Carter (\"The X-Files\") and Damon Lindelof (\"Lost\"). In particular, the regular use of the Illuminati in popular culture as shadowy central puppet masters in this type of fiction can be traced back to their exposure via \"The Illuminatus! Trilogy\".\nEditions.\nMajor English-language editions include:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It entered into popular culture after appearing in \"The Illuminatus! Trilogy\" (1975) of novels written by Robert Shea and Robert Anton Wilson. Here, the interjection \"fnord\" is given hypnotic power over the unenlightened, and children in grade school are taught to be unable to see the word consciously. For the rest of their lives, every appearance of the word subconsciously generates a feeling of unease and confusion which prevents rational consideration of the text in which it appears.\nOther uses.\nThe word has been used in newsgroup and hacker culture to indicate irony, humor, or Surrealism. Placement at the end of a statement in brackets (\"fnord\") explicitly tags the intent, and may be so applied to any random or surreal sentence, coercive subtext, or anything jarringly out of context, intentional or not. It is sometimes used as a metasyntactic variable in programming. Fnord appears in the Church of the SubGenius recruitment film \"Arise!\" and has been used in the SubGenius newsgroup alt.slack.\nOrigins.\nThe word was coined as a nonsensical term with religious undertones in the Discordian parody of religious texts \"Principia Discordia\" (1965), by Kerry Thornley and Greg Hill, but was popularized by \"The Illuminatus! Trilogy\" (1975) of satirical conspiracy fiction novels, by Robert Shea and Robert Anton Wilson. \"Illuminatus!\" was produced, in the United Kingdom, as a cycle of plays by anarchic theatre director Ken Campbell and his Jungian Science Fiction Theatre of Liverpool. The plays further popularized the term.\nIn the novel trilogy (and the plays), the interjection \"fnord\" is given hypnotic power over the unenlightened. Under the Illuminati program, children in grade school are taught to be unable to consciously see the word \"fnord\". For the rest of their lives, every appearance of the word subconsciously generates a feeling of unease and confusion, preventing rational consideration of the text it appears in. The uneasiness and confusion create a perpetual low-level state of fear in the populace. The government acts on the premise that a fearful populace keeps them in power.\nIn the Shea/Wilson construct, fnords\u2014occurrences of the word \"fnord\"\u2014are scattered liberally in the text of newspapers and magazines, causing fear and anxiety in those following current events. However, there are no fnords in the advertisements, encouraging a consumerist society. The exclusion of the text from rational consciousness also enables the Illuminati to publish messages to each other in newspapers, etc., without fear that other people will be aware of them. It is implied in the books that \"fnord\" is not the actual word used for this task, but merely a substitute, since most readers would be unable to see the actual word.\nTo \"see the fnords\" means to be unaffected by the supposed hypnotic power of the word or, more loosely, of other fighting words. The term may also be used to refer to the experience of becoming aware of a phenomenon's ubiquity after first observing it. The phrase \"I have seen the fnords\" was graffitied on a British railway bridge throughout the 1980s and 1990s, until the bridge was upgraded. The bridge, located between Earlsdon and Coventry city centre, is known locally as \"Anarchy Bridge\". The bridge and the phrase were mentioned in the novel \"A Touch of Love\" by Jonathan Coe.\nUsage.\nThe lack of a clear definition of the word, and its popularity among certain groups on the internet, allowed it to be appropriated as a placeholder word (a metasyntactic variable) in computer programming, particularly by those with ties to Discordianism or the Church of the SubGenius. It has also been found useful as the name for a \"techno cultural\" conference, computer programs, and as a general placeholder word in computing literature.\nFnord! is the name of a (now defunct) freeware NT web server created by Brian Morin in 1995 and transferred to the care of Stephen Kazmierczak in 1997 when Morin was initiated into the summer Internet Server group at Microsoft. In his final transmission, Morin cites concern for potential legal backlash from the established tech giant as the reason for abandoning development of the free Fnord! server solution. Microsoft released Windows 95 and the accompanying Microsoft Network in the same time frame, which was seen as a play by the tech giant to monopolize the emerging online experience of dial-up users by introducing a toll road style business plan for accessing the world's information.\nPaulo Goode, a typeface designer from West Cork, Ireland, created a serif font named Fnord in 2016 which contains 23 fonts in five weights. The geometry of the upper case 'O' is drawn on an axis of 23 degrees while the lower case 'o' falls on a 17-degree axis. The 23 / 17 numerology is reflective of similar numerical themes from The Illuminatus! Trilogy.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Durkheim formally established the academic discipline of sociology and is commonly cited as one of the principal architects of modern social science, along with both Karl Marx and Max Weber.\nMuch of Durkheim's work concerns the inability of societies to maintain their integrity and coherence in modernity, an era in which traditional social and religious ties are much less universal, and in which new social institutions have come into being. Durkheim's conception of the scientific study of society laid the groundwork for modern sociology, and he used such scientific tools as statistics, surveys, and historical observation in his analysis of suicides in Roman Catholic and Protestant groups.\nDurkheim's first major sociological work was (1893; \"The Division of Labour in Society\"), followed in 1895 by (\"The Rules of Sociological Method\"). Also in 1895 Durkheim set up the first European department of sociology and became France's first professor of sociology. Durkheim's seminal monograph, \"Le Suicide\" (1897), a study of suicide rates in Roman Catholic and Protestant populations, pioneered modern social research, serving to distinguish social science from psychology and political philosophy. In 1898, he established the journal \"L'Ann\u00e9e sociologique\". (1912; \"The Elementary Forms of the Religious Life\") presented a theory of religion, comparing the social and cultural lives of aboriginal and modern societies.\nDurkheim was preoccupied with the acceptance of sociology as a legitimate science. Refining the positivism originally set forth by Auguste Comte, he promoted what could be considered as a form of epistemological realism, as well as the use of the hypothetico-deductive model in social science. For Durkheim, sociology was the science of \"institutions\", understanding the term in its broader meaning as the \"beliefs and modes of behaviour instituted by the collectivity,\" with its aim being to discover structural social facts. As such, Durkheim was a major proponent of structural functionalism, a foundational perspective in both sociology and anthropology. In his view, social science should be purely holistic in the sense that sociology should study phenomena attributed to society at large, rather than being limited to the study of specific actions of individuals.\nHe remained a dominant force in French intellectual life until his death in 1917, presenting numerous lectures and publishing works on a variety of topics, including the sociology of knowledge, morality, social stratification, religion, law, education, and deviance. Some terms that he coined, such as \"collective consciousness\", are now also used by laypeople.\nEarly life and education.\nDavid \u00c9mile Durkheim was born 15 April 1858 in \u00c9pinal, Lorraine, France, to M\u00e9lanie (Isidor) and Mo\u00efse Durkheim, coming into a long lineage of devout Alsatian Jews. His parents had four other children: Isra\u00ebl (1845-1846), Rosine (1848-1930), F\u00e9lix (1850-1889) and C\u00e9line (1851-1931). Durkheim came from a long line of rabbis, stretching back eight generations, including his father, grandfather, and great-grandfather and began his education in a rabbinical school. However at an early age he switched schools, deciding not to follow in his family's footsteps.Durkheim led a thoroughly secular life, dedicating much of his work to the argument that religious phenomena arise from social rather than divine factors. Nevertheless, he maintained ties with both his family and the Jewish community. In fact many of his most prominent collaborators and students were Jewish, some even being blood relatives. For instance Marcel Mauss, a notable social anthropologist of the prewar era, was his nephew.\nA precocious student, Durkheim entered the \u00c9cole normale sup\u00e9rieure (ENS) in 1879, at his third attempt. The entering class that year was one of the most brilliant of the nineteenth century, as many of his classmates, such as Jean Jaur\u00e8s and Henri Bergson, went on to become major figures in France's intellectual history as well. At the ENS, Durkheim studied under the direction of Numa Denis Fustel de Coulanges, a classicist with a social-scientific outlook, and wrote his Latin dissertation on Montesquieu. At the same time, he read Auguste Comte and Herbert Spencer, whereby Durkheim became interested in a scientific approach to society early on in his career. This meant the first of many conflicts with the French academic system, which had no social science curriculum at the time. Durkheim found humanistic studies uninteresting, turning his attention from psychology and philosophy to ethics and, eventually, sociology. He obtained his \"agr\u00e9gation\" in philosophy in 1882, though finishing next to last in his graduating class owing to serious illness the year before.\nThe opportunity for Durkheim to receive a major academic appointment in Paris was inhibited by his approach to society. From 1882 to 1887 he taught philosophy at several provincial schools. In the 1885-6 school year he visited Germany, where he travelled and studied sociology at the universities of Marburg, Berlin and Leipzig. As Durkheim indicated in several essays, it was in Leipzig that he learned to appreciate the value of empiricism and its language of concrete, complex things, in sharp contrast to the more abstract, clear and simple ideas of the Cartesian method. By 1886, as part of his doctoral dissertation, he had completed the draft of his \"The Division of Labour in Society\", and was working towards establishing the new science of sociology.\nAcademic career.\nDurkheim's period in Germany resulted in the publication of numerous articles on German social science and philosophy; Durkheim was particularly impressed by the work of Wilhelm Wundt. Durkheim's articles gained recognition in France, and he received a teaching appointment in the University of Bordeaux in 1887, where he was to teach the university's first social science course. His official title was , thus he taught both pedagogy and sociology (the latter having never been taught in France before). The appointment of the social scientist to the mostly humanistic faculty was an important sign of changing times and the growing importance and recognition of the social sciences. From this position Durkheim helped reform the French school system, introducing the study of social science in its curriculum. However, his controversial beliefs that religion and morality could be explained in terms purely of social interaction earned him many critics.\nAlso in 1887, Durkheim married Louise Dreyfus. They had two children, Marie and Andr\u00e9.\nThe 1890s were a period of remarkable creative output for Durkheim. In 1893, he published \"The Division of Labour in Society\", his doctoral dissertation and fundamental statement of the nature of human society and its development. Durkheim's interest in social phenomena was spurred on by politics. France's defeat in the Franco-Prussian War led to the fall of the regime of Napoleon III, which was then replaced by the Third Republic. This in turn resulted in a backlash against the new secular and republican rule, as many people considered a vigorously nationalistic approach necessary to rejuvenate France's fading power. Durkheim, a Jew and a staunch supporter of the Third Republic with a sympathy towards socialism, was thus in the political minority, a situation that galvanized him politically. The Dreyfus affair of 1894 only strengthened his activist stance.\nIn 1895, he published \"The Rules of Sociological Method\", a manifesto stating what sociology is and how it ought to be done, and founded the first European department of sociology at the University of Bordeaux. In 1898, he founded \"L'Ann\u00e9e sociologique\", the first French social science journal. Its aim was to publish and publicize the work of what was, by then, a growing number of students and collaborators (this is also the name used to refer to the group of students who developed his sociological program). In 1897, he published \"Suicide\", a case study that provided an example of what a sociological monograph might look like. Durkheim was one of the pioneers of the use of quantitative methods in criminology, which he used in his study of suicide.\nBy 1902, Durkheim had finally achieved his goal of attaining a prominent position in Paris when he became the chair of education at the Sorbonne. Durkheim had aimed for the position earlier, but the Parisian faculty took longer to accept what some called \"sociological imperialism\" and admit social science to their curriculum. He became a full professor (specifically, Professor of the Science of Education) there in 1906, and in 1913 he was named chair in \"Education and Sociology\". Because French universities are technically institutions for training secondary school teachers, this position gave Durkheim considerable influence\u2014his lectures were the only ones that were mandatory for the entire student body. Durkheim had much influence over the new generation of teachers; around that time he also served as an advisor to the Ministry of Education. In 1912, he published his last major work, \"The Elementary Forms of the Religious Life\".\nDeath.\nThe outbreak of World War I was to have a tragic effect on Durkheim's life. His leftism was always patriotic rather than internationalist, in that he sought a secular, rational form of French life. However, the onset of the war, and the inevitable nationalist propaganda that followed, made it difficult to sustain this already nuanced position. While Durkheim actively worked to support his country in the war, his reluctance to give in to simplistic nationalist fervor (combined with his Jewish background) made him a natural target of the now-ascendant French Right. Even more seriously, the generations of students that Durkheim had trained were now being drafted to serve in the army, many of them perishing in the trenches.\nFinally, Durkheim's own son, Andr\u00e9, died on the war front in December 1915\u2014a loss from which Durkheim never recovered. Emotionally devastated, Durkheim collapsed of a stroke in Paris two years later, on 15 November 1917. He was buried at the Montparnasse Cemetery in Paris.\nMethodology.\nIn \"The Rules of Sociological Method\" (1895), Durkheim expressed his desire to establish a method that would guarantee sociology's truly scientific character. One of the questions raised concerns the objectivity of the sociologist: how may one study an object that, from the very beginning, conditions and relates to the observer? According to Durkheim, observation must be as impartial and impersonal as possible, even though a \"perfectly objective observation\" in this sense may never be attained. A social fact must always be studied according to its relation with other social facts, never according to the individual who studies it. Sociology should therefore privilege comparison rather than the study of singular independent facts.\nDurkheim sought to create one of the first rigorous scientific approaches to social phenomena. Along with Herbert Spencer, he was one of the first people to explain the existence and quality of different parts of a society through referencing what function they served in maintaining the quotidian (i.e. by how they make society \"work\"). He also agreed with Spencer's organic analogy, comparing society to a living organism. As a result, his work is sometimes seen as a precursor to functionalism. Durkheim also insisted that society was more than the sum of its parts.\nUnlike his contemporaries Ferdinand T\u00f6nnies and Max Weber, he did not focus on what motivates individuals' actions (an approach associated with methodological individualism), but rather on the study of \"social facts\".\nInspirations.\nDuring his university studies at the ENS, Durkheim was influenced by two neo-Kantian scholars: Charles Renouvier and \u00c9mile Boutroux. The principles Durkheim absorbed from them included rationalism, scientific study of morality, anti-utilitarianism, and secular education. His methodology was influenced by Numa Denis Fustel de Coulanges, a supporter of the scientific method.\nComte.\nA fundamental influence on Durkheim's thought was the sociological positivism of Auguste Comte, who effectively sought to extend and apply the scientific method found in the natural sciences to the social sciences. According to Comte, a true social science should stress empirical facts, as well as induce general scientific laws from the relationship among these facts. There were many points on which Durkheim agreed with the positivist thesis:\nRealism.\nA second influence on Durkheim's view of society beyond Comte's positivism was the epistemological outlook called \"social realism\". Although he never explicitly espoused it, Durkheim adopted a realist perspective in order to demonstrate the existence of social realities outside the individual and to show that these realities existed in the form of the objective relations of society. As an epistemology of science, \"realism\" can be defined as a perspective that takes as its central point of departure the view that external social realities exist in the outer world and that these realities are independent of the individual's perception of them.\nThis view opposes other predominant philosophical perspectives such as empiricism and positivism. Empiricists, like David Hume, had argued that all realities in the outside world are products of human sense perception, thus all realities are merely perceived: they do not exist independently of our perceptions, and have no causal power in themselves. Comte's positivism went a step further by claiming that scientific laws could be deduced from empirical observations. Going beyond this, Durkheim claimed that sociology would not only discover \"apparent\" laws, but would be able to discover the \"inherent nature\" of society.\nJudaism.\nScholars also debate the exact influence of Jewish thought on Durkheim's work. The answer remains uncertain; some scholars have argued that Durkheim's thought is a form of secularized Jewish thought, while others argue that proving the existence of a direct influence of Jewish thought on Durkheim's achievements is difficult or impossible.\nDurkheim and theory.\nThroughout his career, Durkheim was concerned primarily with three goals. First, to establish sociology as a new academic discipline. Second, to analyse how societies could maintain their integrity and coherence in the modern era, when things such as shared religious and ethnic background could no longer be assumed. To that end he wrote much about the effect of laws, religion, education and similar forces on society and social integration. Lastly, Durkheim was concerned with the practical implications of scientific knowledge. The importance of social integration is expressed throughout Durkheim's work:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;For if society lacks the unity that derives from the fact that the relationships between its parts are exactly regulated, that unity resulting from the harmonious articulation of its various functions assured by effective discipline and if, in addition, society lacks the unity based upon the commitment of men's wills to a common objective, then it is no more than a pile of sand that the least jolt or the slightest puff will suffice to scatter.\u2014\u200a\nEstablishing sociology.\nDurkheim authored some of the most programmatic statements on what sociology is and how it should be practiced. His concern was to establish sociology as a science. Arguing for a place for sociology among other sciences, he wrote, \"sociology is, then, not an auxiliary of any other science; it is itself a distinct and autonomous science.\"\nTo give sociology a place in the academic world and to ensure that it is a legitimate science, it must have an object that is clear and distinct from philosophy or psychology, and its own methodology. He argued that \"there is in every society a certain group of phenomena which may be differentiated from those studied by the other natural sciences.\"\nIn the Tarde-Durkheim debate of 1903, the \"anthropological view\" of Gabriel Tarde was ridiculed and hastily dismissed.\nA fundamental aim of sociology is to discover structural \"social facts\". The establishment of sociology as an independent, recognized academic discipline is among Durkheim's largest and most lasting legacies. Within sociology, his work has significantly influenced structuralism or structural functionalism.\nSocial facts.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;A social fact is every way of acting, fixed or not, capable of exercising on the individual an external constraint; or again, every way of acting which is general throughout a given society, while at the same time existing in its own right independent of its individual manifestations.\u2014\u200a\nDurkheim's work revolved around the study of social facts, a term he coined to describe phenomena that have an existence in and of themselves, are not bound to the actions of individuals, but have a coercive influence upon them. Durkheim argued that social facts have, \"sui generis\", an independent existence greater and more objective than the actions of the individuals that compose society. Only such social facts can explain the observed social phenomena. Being exterior to the individual person, social facts may thus also exercise coercive power on the various people composing society, as it can sometimes be observed in the case of formal laws and regulations, but also in situations implying the presence of informal rules, such as religious rituals or family norms. Unlike the facts studied in natural sciences, a \"social\" fact thus refers to a specific category of phenomena: \"the determining cause of a social fact must be sought among the antecedent social facts and not among the states of the individual consciousness.\"\nSuch facts are endowed with a power of coercion, by reason of which they may control individual behaviors. According to Durkheim, these phenomena cannot be reduced to biological or psychological grounds. Social facts can be material (i.e. physical objects ) or immaterial (i.e. meanings, sentiments, etc.). Though the latter cannot be seen or touched, they are external and coercive, thus becoming real and gaining \"facticity\". Physical objects, too, can represent both material and immaterial social facts. For example, a flag is a physical social fact that is often ingrained with various immaterial social facts (e.g. its meaning and importance).\nMany social facts, however, have no material form. Even the most \"individualistic\" or \"subjective\" phenomena, such as love, freedom, or suicide, were regarded by Durkheim as \"objective\" social facts. Individuals composing society do not directly cause suicide: suicide, as a social fact, exists independently in society, and is caused by other social facts\u2014such as rules governing behavior and group attachment\u2014whether an individual likes it or not. Whether a person \"leaves\" a society does not alter the \"fact\" that this society will \"still contain\" suicides. Suicide, like other immaterial social facts, exists independently of the will of an individual, cannot be eliminated, and is as influential\u2014coercive\u2014as physical laws like gravity. Sociology's task therefore consists of discovering the qualities and characteristics of such social facts, which can be discovered through a quantitative or experimental approach (Durkheim extensively relied on statistics).\nSociety, collective consciousness, and culture.\nRegarding the society itself, like social institutions in general, Durkheim saw it as a set of social facts. Even more than \"what society is,\" Durkheim was interested in answering \"how is a society created\" and \"what holds a society together.\" In \"The Division of Labour in Society\", Durkheim attempts to answer the latter question.\nCollective consciousness.\nDurkheim assumes that humans are inherently egoistic, while \"collective consciousness\" (i.e. norms, beliefs, and values) forms the moral basis of the society, resulting in social integration. \"Collective consciousness\" is therefore of key importance to the society; its requisite function without which the society cannot survive. This consciousness produces the society and holds it together, while, at the same time, individuals produce collective consciousness through their interactions. Through collective consciousness human beings become aware of one another as social beings, not just animals.The totality of beliefs and sentiments common to the average members of a society forms a determinate system with a life of its own. It can be termed the collective or common consciousness.In particular, the emotional part of the collective consciousness overrides our egoism: as we are emotionally bound to culture, we act socially because we recognize it is the responsible, moral way to act. A key to forming society is social interaction, and Durkheim believes that human beings, when in a group, will inevitably act in such a way that a society is formed.\nCulture.\nGroups, when interacting, create their own culture and attach powerful emotions to it, thus making \"culture\" another key social fact. Durkheim was one of the first scholars to consider the question of culture so intensely. Durkheim was interested in cultural diversity, and how the existence of diversity nonetheless fails to destroy a society. To that, Durkheim answered that any apparent cultural diversity is overridden by a larger, common, and more generalized cultural system, and the law.\nIn a socio-evolutionary approach, Durkheim described the evolution of societies from mechanical solidarity to organic solidarity (one rising from mutual need). As societies become more complex, evolving from mechanical to organic solidarity, the division of labour is counteracting and replacing to collective consciousness. In the simpler societies, people are connected to others due to personal ties and traditions; in the larger, modern society they are connected due to increased reliance on others with regard to them performing their specialized tasks needed for the modern, highly complex society to survive. In mechanical solidarity, people are self-sufficient, there is little integration, and thus there is the need for use of force and repression to keep society together. Also, in such societies, people have much fewer options in life. In organic solidarity, people are much more integrated and interdependent, and specialization and cooperation are extensive. Progress from mechanical to organic solidarity is based first on population growth and increasing population density, second on increasing \"morality density\" (development of more complex social interactions) and thirdly, on the increasing specialization in workplace. One of the ways mechanical and organic societies differ is the function of law: in mechanical society the law is focused on its punitive aspect, and aims to reinforce the cohesion of the community, often by making the punishment public and extreme; whereas in the organic society the law focuses on repairing the damage done and is more focused on individuals than the community.\nOne of the main features of the modern, organic society is the importance, sacredness even, given to the concept\u2014social fact\u2014of the individual. The individual, rather than the collective, becomes the focus of rights and responsibilities, the center of public and private rituals holding the society together\u2014a function once performed by the religion. To stress the importance of this concept, Durkheim talked of the \"cult of the individual\":Thus very far from there being the antagonism between the individual and society which is often claimed, moral individualism, the cult of the individual, is in fact the product of society itself. It is society that instituted it and made of man the god whose servant it is.Durkheim saw the population density and growth as key factors in the evolution of the societies and advent of modernity. As the number of people in a given area increase, so does the number of interactions, and the society becomes more complex. Growing competition between the more numerous people also leads to further division of labour. In time, the importance of the state, the law and the individual increases, while that of the religion and moral solidarity decreases.\nIn another example of evolution of culture, Durkheim pointed to fashion, although in this case he noted a more cyclical phenomenon. According to Durkheim, fashion serves to differentiate between lower classes and upper classes, but because lower classes want to look like the upper classes, they will eventually adapt the upper class fashion, depreciating it, and forcing the upper class to adopt a new fashion.\nSocial pathology and crime.\nAs the society, Durkheim noted there are several possible pathologies that could lead to a breakdown of social integration and disintegration of the society: the two most important ones are \"anomie\" and \"forced division of labour\"; lesser ones include the lack of coordination and suicide. To Durkheim, \"anomie\" refers to a lack of social norms; where too rapid of population growth reduces the amount of interaction between various groups, which in turn leads to a breakdown of understanding (i.e. norms, values, etc.). \"Forced division of labour\", on the other hand, refers to a situation in which those who hold power, driven by their desire for profit, which can result in greed, results in people doing work that they are unsuited for. Such people are unhappy, and their desire to change the system can destabilize the society.\nDurkheim's views on crime were a departure from conventional notions. He believed that crime is \"bound up with the fundamental conditions of all social life\" and serves a social function. He states that crime implies \"not only that the way remains open to necessary changes but that in certain cases it directly prepares these changes.\" Examining the trial of Socrates, he argues that \"his crime, namely, the independence of his thought, rendered a service not only to humanity but to his country\" as \"it served to prepare a new morality and faith that the Athenians needed.\" As such, his crime \"was a useful prelude to reforms.\" In this sense, he saw crime as being able to release certain social tensions and so have a cleansing or purging effect in society. \nThe authority which the moral conscience enjoys must not be excessive; otherwise, no-one would dare to criticize it, and it would too easily congeal into an immutable form. To make progress, individual originality must be able to express itself\u2026[even] the originality of the criminal\u2026shall also be possible. \nDeviance.\nDurkheim thought deviance to be an essential component of a functional society. He believed that deviance had three possible effects on society:\nDurkheim's thoughts on deviance contributed to Robert Merton's Strain Theory.\nSuicide.\nIn \"Suicide\" (1897), Durkheim explores the differing suicide rates among Protestants and Roman Catholics, arguing that stronger social control among Roman Catholics results in lower suicide rates. According to Durkheim, Roman Catholic society has normal levels of integration while Protestant society has low levels. Overall, Durkheim treated suicide as a social fact, explaining variations in its rate on a macro level, considering society-scale phenomena such as lack of connections between people (group attachment) and lack of regulations of behavior, rather than individuals' feelings and motivations.\nDurkheim believed there was more to suicide than extremely personal individual life circumstances such as loss of a job, divorce, or bankruptcy. Instead, Durkheim explained suicide as a symptom of collective social deviance, like alcoholism or homicide.\nHe created a normative theory of suicide focusing on the conditions of group life. Proposing four different types of suicide, which include \"egoistic\", \"altruistic\", \"anomic\", and \"fatalistic\", Durkheim began his theory by plotting social regulation on the x-axis of his chart, and social integration on the y-axis:\nThis study has been extensively discussed by later scholars and several major criticisms have emerged. First, Durkheim took most of his data from earlier researchers, notably Adolph Wagner and Henry Morselli, who were much more careful in generalizing from their own data. Second, later researchers found that the Protestant\u2013Catholic differences in suicide seemed to be limited to German-speaking Europe and thus may have always been the spurious reflection of other factors. Durkheim's study of suicide has been criticized as an example of the logical error termed the ecological fallacy. However, diverging views have contested whether Durkheim's work really contained an ecological fallacy. More recent authors such as Berk (2006) have also questioned the micro\u2013macro relations underlying Durkheim's work. Some, such as Inkeles (1959), Johnson (1965), and Gibbs (1968), have claimed that Durkheim's only intent was to explain suicide \"sociologically\" within a holistic perspective, emphasizing that \"he intended his theory to explain variation among social environments in the incidence of suicide, not the suicides of particular individuals.\"\nDespite its limitations, Durkheim's work on suicide has influenced proponents of control theory, and is often mentioned as a classic sociological study. The book pioneered modern social research and served to distinguish social science from psychology and political philosophy.ch.1\nReligion.\nIn \"The Elementary Forms of the Religious Life\" (1912), Durkheim's first purpose was to identify the social origin and function of religion as he felt that religion was a source of camaraderie and solidarity. His second purpose was to identify links between certain religions in different cultures, finding a common denominator. He wanted to understand the empirical, social aspect of religion that is common to all religions and goes beyond the concepts of spirituality and God.\nDurkheim defined \"religion\" as: \"a unified system of beliefs and practices relative to sacred things, i.e., things set apart and forbidden\u2014beliefs and practices which unite in one single moral community called a Church, all those who adhere to them.\"In this definition, Durkheim avoids references to supernatural or God. Durkheim rejected earlier definitions by Tylor that religion was \"belief in supernatural beings,\" finding that primitive societies such as the Australian aborigines (following the ethnologies of Spencer and Gillen, largely discredited later) did not divide reality into \"natural\" vs. \"supernatural\" realms, but rather into realms of the \"sacred\" and the \"profane,\" which were not moral categories, since both could include what was good or evil. Durkheim argues we are left with the following three concepts:\nOut of those three concepts, Durkheim focused on the sacred, noting that it is at the very core of a religion:They are only collective forces hypostasized, that is to say, moral forces; they are made up of the ideas and sentiments awakened in us by the spectacle of society, and not of sensations coming from the physical world.Durkheim saw religion as the most fundamental social institution of humankind, and one that gave rise to other social forms. It was religion that gave humanity the strongest sense of collective consciousness. Durkheim saw religion as a force that emerged in the early hunter-gatherer societies, as the emotions collective effervescence run high in the growing groups, forcing them to act in a new ways, and giving them a sense of some hidden force driving them. Over time, as emotions became symbolized and interactions ritualized, religion became more organized, giving a rise to the division between the sacred and the profane. However, Durkheim also believed that religion was becoming less important, as it was being gradually superseded by science and the cult of an individual.Thus there is something eternal in religion which is destined to survive all the particular symbols in which religious thought has successively enveloped itself.However, even if the religion was losing its importance for Durkheim, it still laid the foundation of modern society and the interactions that governed it. And despite the advent of alternative forces, Durkheim argued that no replacement for the force of religion had yet been created. He expressed his doubt about modernity, seeing the modern times as \"a period of transition and moral mediocrity.\"\nDurkheim also argued that our primary categories for understanding the world have their origins in religion. It is religion, Durkheim writes, that gave rise to most if not all other social constructs, including the larger society. Durkheim argued that categories are produced by the society, and thus are collective creations. Thus as people create societies, they also create categories, but at the same time, they do so unconsciously, and the categories are prior to any individual's experience. In this way Durkheim attempted to bridge the divide between seeing categories as constructed out of human experience and as logically prior to that experience. Our understanding of the world is shaped by social facts; for example the notion of time is defined by being measured through a calendar, which in turn was created to allow us to keep track of our social gatherings and rituals; those in turn on their most basic level originated from religion. In the end, even the most logical and rational pursuit of science can trace its origins to religion. Durkheim states that, \"Religion gave birth to all that is essential in the society.\"\nIn his work, Durkheim focused on \"totemism\", the religion of the Aboriginal Australians and Native Americans. Durkheim saw this religion as the most ancient religion, and focused on it as he believed its simplicity would ease the discussion of the essential elements of religion. As such, he wrote:Now the totem is the flag of the clan. It is therefore natural that the impressions aroused by the clan in individual minds\u2014impressions of dependence and of increased vitality\u2014should fix themselves to the idea of the totem rather than that of the clan: for the clan is too complex a reality to be represented clearly in all its complex unity by such rudimentary intelligences.Durkheim's work on religion was criticized on both empirical and theoretical grounds by specialists in the field. The most important critique came from Durkheim's contemporary, Arnold van Gennep, an expert on religion and ritual, and also on Australian belief systems. Van Gennep argued that Durkheim's views of primitive peoples and simple societies were \"entirely erroneous\". Van Gennep further argued that Durkheim demonstrated a lack of critical stance towards his sources, collected by traders and priests, naively accepting their veracity, and that Durkheim interpreted freely from dubious data. At the conceptual level, van Gennep pointed out Durkheim's tendency to press ethnography into a prefabricated theoretical scheme.\nDespite such critiques, Durkheim's work on religion has been widely praised for its theoretical insight and whose arguments and propositions, according to Robert Alun Jones, \"have stimulated the interest and excitement of several generations of sociologists irrespective of theoretical 'school' or field of specialization.\"\nSociology of knowledge.\nWhile Durkheim's work deals with a number of subjects, including suicide, the family, social structures, and social institutions, a large part of his work deals with the sociology of knowledge.\nWhile publishing short articles on the subject earlier in his career, Durkheim's definitive statement concerning the sociology of knowledge comes in his 1912 \"magnum opus\", \"The Elementary Forms of Religious Life\". This book has as its goal not only the elucidation of the social origins and function of religion, but also the social origins and impact of society on language and logical thought. Durkheim worked largely out of a Kantian framework and sought to understand how the concepts and categories of logical thought could arise out of social life. He argued, for example, that the categories of space and time were not \"a priori\". Rather, the category of space depends on a society's social grouping and geographical use of space, and a group's social rhythm that determines our understanding of time. In this Durkheim sought to combine elements of rationalism and empiricism, arguing that certain aspects of logical thought common to all humans did exist, but that they were products of collective life (thus contradicting the \"tabula rasa\" empiricist understanding whereby categories are acquired by individual experience alone), and that they were not universal \"a\" \"prioris\" (as Kant argued) since the content of the categories differed from society to society.\nCollective representations.\nAnother key elements to Durkheim's theory of knowledge outlined in \"Elementary Forms\" is the concept of (\"collective representations\"). ' are the symbols and images that come to represent the ideas, beliefs, and values elaborated by a collectivity and are not reducible to individual constituents. They can include words, slogans, ideas, or any number of material items that can serve as a symbol, such as a cross, a rock, a temple, a feather etc. As Durkheim elaborates, ' are created through intense social interaction and are products of collective activity. As such, these representations have the particular, and somewhat contradictory, aspect that they exist externally to the individual\u2014since they are created and controlled not by the individual but by society as a whole\u2014yet, simultaneously within each individual of the society, by virtue of that individual's participation within society.\nArguably the most important \"\" is language, which according to Durkheim is a product of collective action. And because language is a collective action, language contains within it a history of accumulated knowledge and experience that no individual would be capable of creating on their own:If concepts were only general ideas, they would not enrich knowledge a great deal, for, as we have already pointed out, the general contains nothing more than the particular. But if before all else they are collective representations, they add to that which we can learn by our own personal experience all that wisdom and science which the group has accumulated in the course of centuries. Thinking by concepts, is not merely seeing reality on its most general side, but it is projecting a light upon the sensation which illuminates it, penetrates it and transforms it.As such, language, as a social product, literally structures and shapes our experience of reality. This discursive approach to language and society was developed by later French philosophers, such as Michel Foucault.\nMorality.\nHow many times, indeed, it [crime] is only an anticipation of future morality - a step toward what will be! \u2014\u200a\u00c9mile Durkheim, 'Division of Labour in Society'\nDurkheim defines morality as \"a system of rules for conduct\". His analysis of morality is influenced by Immanuel Kant and his notion of duty. While Durkheim was influenced by Kant, he was critical of aspects of the latter's moral theory and developed his own positions.\nDurkheim agrees with Kant that within morality, there is an element of obligation, \"a moral authority which, by manifesting itself in certain precepts particularly important to it, confers upon [moral rules] an obligatory character.\" Morality tells us how to act from a position of superiority. There exists a certain, pre-established moral norm to which we must conform. It is through this view that Durkheim makes a first critique of Kant in saying that moral duties originate in society, and are not to be found in some universal moral concept such as the categorical imperative. Durkheim also argues that morality is characterized not just by this obligation, but is also something that is desired by the individual. The individual believes that by adhering to morality, they are serving the common Good, and for this reason, the individual submits voluntarily to the moral commandment.\nHowever, in order to accomplish its aims, morality must be legitimate in the eyes of those to whom it speaks. As Durkheim argues, this moral authority is primarily to be located in religion, which is why in any religion one finds a code of morality. For Durkheim, it is only society that has the resources, the respect, and the power to cultivate within an individual both the obligatory and the desirous aspects of morality.\nInfluence and legacy.\nDurkheim has had an important impact on the development of anthropology and sociology as disciplines. The establishment of sociology as an independent, recognized academic discipline, in particular, is among Durkheim's largest and most lasting legacies. Within sociology, his work has significantly influenced structuralism, or structural functionalism. Scholars inspired by Durkheim include Jonathan Haidt, Marcel Mauss, Maurice Halbwachs, C\u00e9lestin Bougl\u00e9, Gustave Belot, Alfred Radcliffe-Brown, Talcott Parsons, Robert K. Merton, Jean Piaget, Claude L\u00e9vi-Strauss, Ferdinand de Saussure, Michel Foucault, Clifford Geertz, Peter Berger, social reformer Patrick Hunout, and others.\nMore recently, Durkheim has influenced sociologists such as Steven Lukes, Robert N. Bellah, and Pierre Bourdieu. His description of \"collective consciousness\" also influenced Ziya G\u00f6kalp, the founder of Turkish sociology who replaced Durkheim's concept of society with nation. An ideologue who provided the intellectual justification for the Ottoman Empire's wars of aggression and massive demographic engineering\u2014including the Armenian genocide\u2014he could be considered to pervert Durkheim's ideas. Randall Collins has developed a theory of what he calls \"interaction ritual chains\", a synthesis of Durkheim's work on religion with that of Erving Goffman's micro-sociology. Goffman himself was also influenced by Durkheim in his development of the \"interaction order\".\nOutside of sociology, Durkheim has influenced philosophers, including Henri Bergson and Emmanuel Levinas, and his ideas can be identified, inexplicitly, in the work of certain structuralist theorists of the 1960s, such as Alain Badiou, Louis Althusser, and Michel Foucault.\nDurkheim contra Searle.\nMuch of Durkheim's work remains unacknowledged in philosophy, despite its direct relevance. As proof, one can look to John Searle, whose book, \"The Construction of Social Reality\", elaborates a theory of social facts and collective representations that Searle believed to be a landmark work that would bridge the gap between analytic and continental philosophy. Neil Gross, however, demonstrates how Searle's views on society are more or less a reconstitution of Durkheim's theories of social facts, social institutions, collective representations, and the like. Searle's ideas are thus open to the same criticisms as Durkheim's. Searle responded by arguing that Durkheim's work was worse than he had originally believed, and, admitting that he had not read much of Durkheim's work: \"Because Durkheim's account seemed so impoverished I did not read any further in his work.\" Stephen Lukes, however, responded to Searle's reply to Gross, refuting, point by point, the allegations that Searle makes against Durkheim, essentially upholding the argument of Gross, that Searle's work bears great resemblance to that of Durkheim. Lukes attributes Searle's miscomprehension of Durkheim's work to the fact that Searle, quite simply, never read Durkheim.\nGilbert pro Durkheim.\nMargaret Gilbert, a contemporary British philosopher of social phenomena, has offered a close, sympathetic reading of Durkheim's discussion of social facts in the first chapter and the prefaces of \"The Rules of Sociological Method\". In her 1989 book, \"On Social Facts\"\u2014the title of which may represent an homage to Durkheim, alluding to his \"\"\u2014Gilbert argues that some of his statements that may seem to be philosophically untenable are important and fruitful.\nSelected works.\nPublished posthumously\nReferences.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The humour comes from the rejection of such taboos, and is a part of modern culture.\nMusic.\nToilet humour is sometimes found in song and rhyme, particularly schoolboy songs. Examples of this are found in Mozart and scatology, and variants of the German folk schoolboys' song known as the \"Schei\u00dfe-Lied\" (English: \"Shit-Song\") which is indexed in the German \"Volksliederarchiv\". A children's Spanish musical duo, , made a song called \"Caca Culo Pedo Pis\", which literally translates to \"Poop Butt Fart Pee\".\nDetroit rapper Eminem famously utilises crude humour throughout his discography. His most notorious example of toilet humour was featured on the 2017 album \"Revival\", where he raps \"Your booty is heavy duty, like diarrhea\", a line which received extensive lament from critics. The \"Los Angeles Times\" comments: \"If Hannibal Lecter could have recorded a rap album, this would have been it. Brilliant, sinister, scatological and a parent's nightmare.\"\nCzech goregrind band Gutalax, along with some grindcore bands uses cloaca humour as its primary musical themes.\nPerformance.\nUrinating statues at the Fountain of Diana\nPaul Oldfield, who performed under the name Mr. Methane, performed a stage act that included him farting the notes of music. Joseph Pujol, who performed under the name Le P\u00e9tomane (French for \"fart maniac\"), performed a similar stage act for the Paris music hall scene.\nThe American comedy duo Tim &amp; Eric have made numerous comedy sketches based around toilet humour. For example, they have made fake commercials for non-existent products such as the \"Poop Tube\" (a device that lets people release liquefied faecal matter into a urinal while standing up), the \"fla'Hat\" (a hat that is connected to the wearer's anus which expands when storing flatulence), and \"D-Pants\" (an undergarment invented by \"Diah Riha-Jones\" that captures \"uncontrollable diarrhea\").\nIn the series \"South Park\", the Canadian comedy duo Terrance and Phillip are noted for toilet humour and often make comedic use of their flatulence e.g. in the song \"Uncle Fucker\".\nEnglish actor Adrian Edmondson, who appeared in many shows utilising toilet humour, is quoted as saying, \"Toilet humour is like jazz: everybody has an idea what it is, and most people don't like it.\u00a0But the people who do like it are fervent about it and like it until they die.\"\nBooks.\nIn 1929 comedian Charles \"Chic\" Sale published a small book, \"The Specialist\", which was a large \"underground\" success. Its entire premise centered on sales of outhouses, touting the advantages of one kind or another, and labeling them in \"technical\" terms such as \"one-holers\", \"two-holers\", etc. Over a million copies were sold. In 1931 his monologue \"I'm a Specialist\" was made into a hit record (Victor 22859) by recording artist Frank Crumit (music by Nels Bitterman). As memorialized in the \"Outhouse Wall of Fame\", the term \"Chic Sale\" became a rural slang synonym for privies, an appropriation of Mr. Sale's name that he personally considered unfortunate.\nMore recently, one of the most popular books about defecation, diarrhea and accidents in toilets is by straight-talking physician Jane Wilson-Howarth, a guide that began as \"Shitting Pretty\" and then was relaunched as \"How to Shit around the World\".\nThe famous Russian literary satirist Vladimir Voinovich included toilet humour to criticize food policies in the Soviet Union. His novel \"Moscow 2042\" (1987) presents a negative utopia in which a fictional communist government recycles faeces to create food for common citizens while the powerful eat proper food. In Voinovich\u2019s previous novel \"Life and Adventures of Private Ivan Chonkin\" (1969/ 1975), a farmer experiments with urine and faeces and brews vodka out of excrement.\nThe children's book series \"Captain Underpants\" makes copious use of toilet humor. \"Doctor Diaper\", \"The Bionic Booger Boy\", and \"Professor Pippy Pee-Pee Poopypants\" are among the villains in the series.\nVideo games.\nA game notorious for its juvenile humour, \"Conker's Bad Fur Day\" contains a plentiful amount of scatological jokes. One of the landmark areas is a \"Poo Mountain\" and some of its missions involve getting cows to drink a laxative prune juice to produce \"pooballs\", or fighting The Great Mighty Poo, a giant opera-singing pile of feces as a boss. In a later mission, the game's protagonist also has urination as an attack, after drinking a lot of beer and getting drunk.\nToilet humour is also versatile in the \"Metal Gear\" franchise. Solid Snake can protect himself from wolf attacks by having one urinate on him. In ', Raiden can spot soldiers relieving themselves several times and also stand under them. In ', Raiden is instructed in order to use a terminal, he first needs to \"take a DOOMP\", which is an abbreviation for \"digital-optical output mounted proxy\".\nKojima's later game Death Stranding included a mechanic allowing the player character to urinate in the field, as well as urinate or defecate in his room's bathroom, where his bodily output can be processed into grenades of types \"number 1\" and \"number 2\".\nA trait of Wario from the eponymous spin-off franchise is a powerful flatulence attack extensively used in his \"Super Smash Bros.\" appearance.\nToys.\nThe Moose Toys franchise Little Live \"Gotta Go\" Pets is a toy line of interactive plush animals that \"poop\" when fed colourful sand. The toys make graphic noises of passing gas, panic and say the words \"uh-oh! Gotta go!\" and have scatological names including \"turdle\" (turtle). The internet critic Doug Walker called the toys \"disgusting\" and found them immature and inappropriate. Parenting blogs praised the toy line for its crude humour approach to potty training.\nMattel fashion doll Barbie has a plastic golden retriever, named Tanner, which has been an available toy in different variations since the 1990s. Tanner the dog eats brown bean-like beads and then poops them out when its tail is pressed. Barbie can then pick up the plastic poop with a scooper that comes with the playsets.\nInfant dolls, typically targeted towards little girls, have existed for decades that urinate and defecate (into diapers or potties) as a play feature. Variants include \"Magic Potty Baby\" (a 1990s Tyco brand doll) and \"Baby Alive\" (and Amazon knock-off counterfeit variants) that pee, poop and release glitter from their rear ends. The trend of scatological dolls for girls was mocked on the 1970s British comedy TV series \"Are You Being Served?\" in the episode \"A Change Is as Good as a Rest\"; salesman Mr. Lucas fills Ms. Brahms's peeing dollies with fizzy carbonated lemonade; another gag features character Mrs. Slocombe displaying two doll variants to a customer: the one manufactured in Britain is blonde-haired and says \"I want to go to the potty\" when a string on its back is pulled, while a similar doll with sandy hair manufactured in India says \"my name is Yasmin, and I have just \"been\" to the potty\" when its string is pulled.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "38221", "revid": "32791795", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=38221", "title": "Shit", "text": "Vulgar English word\nShit is an English-language profanity. As a noun, it refers to fecal matter, and as a verb it means to defecate; in the plural (\"the shits\"), it means diarrhea. Shite is a common variant in British and Irish English. As a slang term, \"shit\" has many meanings, including: nonsense, foolishness, something of little value or quality, trivial and usually boastful or inaccurate talk or a contemptible person. It could also be used to refer to any other noun in general or as an expression of annoyance, concern, surprise or anger. &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nEtymology.\nThe word is likely derived from Old English, having the nouns \"scite\" (dung, attested only in place names) and \"scitte\" (diarrhoea) and the verb \"sc\u012btan\" (to defecate, attested only in \"besc\u012btan\", to cover with excrement); eventually it morphed into Middle English \"sch\u012btte\" (excrement), \"schyt\" (diarrhoea) and \"shiten\" (to defecate), and it is virtually certain that it was used in some form by preliterate Germanic tribes at the time of the Roman Empire. The word may be further traced to Proto-Germanic *\"skit\"-, and ultimately to Proto-Indo-European *\"skheid\"- \"cut, separate\", the same root believed to have become the word \"shed\". The word has several cognates in modern Germanic languages, such as German \"Schei\u00dfe\", Dutch \"schijt\", Swedish \"skit\", Icelandic \"sk\u00edtur\", Norwegian \"skitt\" etc. Ancient Greek had 'sk\u014dr' (gen. 'skatos' hence 'scato-'), from Proto-Indo-European *\"sker\"-, which is likely unrelated.\nUsage.\nThe word \"shit\" (also \"shite\" in British and Hiberno-English) is considered profanity and is usually avoided in formal speech. Minced oath substitutes for the word \"shit\" in English include \"shoot\", \"shucks\", \"sugar\", and the euphemistic backronym, \"Sugar, Honey, Ice(d) Tea\".\nIn the word's literal sense, it has a rather small range of common usages. An unspecified or collective occurrence of feces is generally \"shit\" or \"some shit\"; a single deposit of feces is sometimes \"a shit\" or \"a piece of shit\"; and to defecate is \"to shit\" or \"to take a shit\". While it is common to speak of shit as existing in \"a pile\", \"a load\", \"a hunk\", and other quantities and configurations, such expressions flourish most strongly in the figurative.\nWhen uttered as an exclamation or interjection, \"shit\" may convey astonishment or a feeling of being favorably impressed or disgusted. Similar utterances might be \"damn!\", \"wow!\" or \"yuck!\".\n\"Piece of shit\" may also be used figuratively to describe a particularly loathsome individual, or an object that is of poor quality (\"this car is a \"piece of shit\"\", often abbreviated to \"P.O.S.\").\nOne study published in 2017 argued that \"shit studies\" is a cross-disciplinary meta-field of rhetorical inquiry about human communication and reasoning. The authors explained, \"rhetorical studies has theorized 'shit' in terms of the communication of transformation, style, and textual relations,\" particularly in relation to claims of expertise to topics such as \"anti-semitism\" and \"wine-tasting.\" They conclude that bullshit speech is one-sided discourse that is difficult to penetrate because it contains \"ideological barriers to the expectation of mutuality,\" working to deflect critical responses.\nVague noun.\n\"Shit\" can be used as a generic mass noun similar to \"stuff\"; for instance, \"This show is funny (as) shit\" or \"This test is hard (as) shit\", or \"That was stupid shit\". These three usages (with \"funny\", \"hard\", and \"stupid\" or another synonym of \"stupid\") are heard most commonly in the United States. Using \"as\" denotes a subtle change in the meaning of the expression; however, the overall intent is basically the same.\nIn the expression \"Get your shit together!\", the word \"shit\" can refer either to one's wits or composure or to one's things, gear, etc. \"He doesn't have his shit together\" means that his affairs are disordered, reflecting not bad luck or forces beyond his control, but his personal shortcomings.\nTo \"shoot the shit\" is to have a friendly but pointless conversation, as in \"Come by my place some time and we'll shoot the shit.\"\nA \"shithole\" is any unpleasant place to be, much like a hellhole. This usage originates from a reference to a pit toilet.\nA \"crock of shit\" is something (a situation, explanation, argument, etc.) that is nonsense or fabricated as a deception or evasion; i.e. bullshit. Often abbreviated simply as \"crock\". Example: \"You expect me to believe that ?? What a crock!\"\nThe phrase \"built like a brick shithouse\" is used in the United States to compliment a curvaceous woman, but in other English-speaking countries to compliment men with athletic physiques. This meaning originates from the observation that most shithouses are rather ramshackle affairs constructed of plywood or scrap sheets of steel.\n\"The shitter\" is a slang term for a toilet, and can be used like the phrase \"...down the toilet\" to suggest that something has been wasted. Example: \"This CD player quit working one friggin' week after I bought it, and I lost the receipt! Twenty bucks right down the shitter!\"\n\"Shit on a shingle\" is U.S. military slang for creamed chipped beef on toast. In polite company, this can be abbreviated as \"SOS\".\nTrouble.\n\"Shit\" can be used to denote trouble, by saying one is in \"a lot of shit\" or \"deep shit\" (a common euphemism is \"deep doo-doo\"). A \"shitstorm\" would be quite a lot of trouble happening all in one place at one time. It's common for someone to refer to an unpleasant thing as \"hard shit\" (\"You got a speeding ticket? Man, that's some hard shit\"), but the phrase \"tough shit\" is used as an unsympathetic way of saying \"too bad\" to whoever is having problems (\"You got arrested? Tough shit, man!\") or as a way of expressing to someone that they need to stop complaining about something and cope with it instead (Billy: \"I got arrested because of you!\" Tommy: \"Tough shit, dude, you knew you might get arrested when you chose to come with me.\") Note that in this case, as in many cases with the term, \"tough shit\" is often said as a way of pointing out someone's fault in his/her own current problem. It's also common to express annoyance by simply saying \"Shit\".\nA \"shitload\" of something is a large quantity, especially something unpleasant or disgusting. \"The boss dumped a shitload of extra work for me this week.\" A \"shit sandwich\" is something (like a situation or state of affairs) unpleasant made triflingly more palatable by packaging it in things less unpleasant, as rotten meat sandwiched in bread. The term shit sandwich originates from an old joke that goes: \"Life is a shit sandwich. The more bread (money) you got, the less shit you have to eat.\"\n\"Up shit creek\" or especially \"Up shit creek without a paddle\" describes a situation in which one is in severe difficulties with no apparent means of solution (this is simply a profane version of the older saying \"up the creek without a paddle\", profanity added for emphasis or humor).\n\"Shit happens\" means that bad happenings in life are inevitable. This is usually spoken with a sigh or a shrug, but can be spoken derisively to someone who complains too often about his ill fortunes, or in an irritating manner.\n\"When the shit hits the fan\" is usually used to refer to a specific time of confrontation or trouble, which requires decisive action. This is often used in reference to combat situations and the action scenes in movies, but can also be used for everyday instances that one might be apprehensive about. \"I don't want to be here when the shit hits the fan!\" indicates that the speaker is dreading this moment (which can be anything from an enemy attack to confronting an angry parent or friend). In polite society, it is often reduced to \"when it hits the fan\". \"He's the one to turn to when the shit hits the fan\" is an indication that the person being talked about is dependable and will not run from trouble or abandon their allies in tough situations. The concept of this phrase is simple enough, as the actual substance striking the rotating blades of a fan would cause a messy and unpleasant situation (much like being in the presence of a manure spreader). Whether or not this has actually happened, or if the concept is simply feasible enough for most people to imagine the result without needing it to be demonstrated, is unknown. Another example might be the saying \"shit rolls downhill\", a metaphor suggesting that trouble for a manager may be transferred to the subordinates. There are a number of anecdotes and jokes about such situations, as the imagery of these situations is considered to be funny. This is generally tied-in with the concept that disgusting and messy substances spilled onto someone else are humorous.\nFor someone to be described as \"shitfaced\" means that person is essentially incapacitated by alcoholic intoxication (i.e. in a thoroughly drunken state).\nDispleasure.\n\"Shit\" can comfortably stand in for the terms \"bad\" and \"anything\" in many instances (\"Dinner was good, but the movie was shit.\" \"You're all mad at me, but I didn't do shit!\"). A comparison can also be used, as in \"Those pants look like shit\", or \"This stuff tastes like shit\". Many usages are idiomatic. \"I'm shit out of luck\" usually refers to someone who is at the end of their wits or who has no remaining viable options. In polite company the acronym \"SOL\" is commonly substituted for this. \"That little shit shot me in the ass\", suggests a mischievous or contemptuous person. Euphemisms such as \"crap\" are not usually used in this context.\nThe exclamations \"oh shit!\" and \"aw shit!\" are used to express displeasure or embarrassment (sometimes facetiously) with oneself when one makes a mistake, especially a stupid or avoidable mistake. When used to comment on the actions of someone else, they can take on a more humorous quality if the mistake does not result in serious consequences. \"Oh shit!\" is also a reflexive expression of horror or terror, as when witnessing or being involved in a life-threatening situation (for example, a vehicle accident).\nThe term \"piece of shit\" is generally used to classify a product or service as being sufficiently below the writer's understanding of generally accepted quality standards to be of negligible and perhaps even negative value. The term \"piece of shit\" has greater precision than \"shit\" or \"shitty\" in that \"piece of shit\" identifies the low quality of a specific component or output of a process without applying a derogatory slant to the entire process. For example, if one said \"The youth orchestra has been a remarkably successful initiative. The fact that the orchestra's recent rendition of Tchaikovsky's Manfred Symphony in B minor was pretty much a piece of shit should not in any way detract from this.\" The substitution of \"shit\" or \"shitty\" for \"pretty much a piece of shit\" would imply irony and would therefore undermine the strength of the statement.\nThe phrase \"(I don't) give a shit\" can be used when one does not care about something, or has a passive attitude toward said thing, as it denotes indifference. In context, one can say: \"You're offended? Well, I don't give a shit!\" or \"You're telling me? Go find somebody who gives a shit.\" President Richard Nixon said to aide H.R. Haldeman while being tape recorded in the Oval Office, \"I don't give a shit about the lira.\" He meant he was too busy managing the Watergate affair to consider a crisis in the Italian monetary system.\nThe \"shit list\" is a category of people who are in ill favor with some individual or group of people, perhaps as the managers of a company, and likely to be the targets of special treatment.\nThe phrase \"take shit\" means to receive bad or frivolous treatment from someone. Such an abused person might say \"I'm not taking any more of your shit!\" to indicate that they will no longer tolerate such treatment.\n\"Whale shit\" is sometimes used to describe a person who inspires displeasure or disgust, as in: \"You're lower than whale shit at the bottom of the ocean!\"\n\u201cYou can\u2019t polish shit\u201d is a popular aphorism roughly equivalent to \"putting Lipstick on a pig\" (although \"a turd\" is more commonly used). However, the TV show \"Mythbusters\" showed that a person can, in fact, polish a turd.\nDominance.\n\"Shit\" can also be used to establish social superiority over someone else. The most common gibe is \"eat shit!\" (cf \"coprophagy\") expressing contempt. Some other personal word may be added such as \"eat my shit\" implying truly personal connotations. As an aside, the above is actually a contraction of the phrase \"eat shit and die!\". It is often said without commas as a curse; they command the other party to perform exactly those actions in that order. However, the term was originally \"Eat, Shit, and Die\" naming the three most basic things humans have to do, and it is common among soldiers.\nThe phrase \"You ain't shit\", expresses an air of intimidation over the addressee, expressing that they mean nothing or are worthless.\n\"Hot shit\" can be a reference to a matter or thing of supreme importance or urgency (\"This report is really hot shit!\"). It can be used in adjectival form: \"This memo's shit-hot!\". \"Hot shit\" can also refer to a person who either overestimates his own worth or ability, or is highly estimated by others (\"He thinks he's some hot shit!\" or \"He's one hot shit!\"). In polite company the euphemism \"hotshot\" may be substituted when referring to a person.\nA speaker may show dominance through arrogance using the phrase \"His shit don't stink\". Its grammatical incorrectness highlights the self-importance of the referent relative to the speaker; though \"His shit does not stink\" may come across as being more emphatic due to the mixed diction between its grammatical correctness and the vulgarity of \"shit\". This phrase conveys the haughtiness of the referent and that he considers himself beyond reproach. For example: \"Those pompous assholes in Finance are the ones who ruined the company \u2013 their shit don't even stink!\" A variation on this theme might be: \"Everything he shits smells just like roses!\"\nThe expression \"shitkicker\" can be used as a pejorative for a menial worker or other low class person. `within the world of (ii) a performer or fan of country-and-western music. The term shitkicker may be substituted with the less vulgar \"chipkicker\", as in Lyle Lovett's song \"Give back my heart\" on \"Pontiac\", where a girl in a \"cowboy-looking bar\" is described as a \"chipkicker-redneck woman\".\nThe word \"shithead\" is a commonly heard insult. A shithead may also be referred to as a \"shit-for-brains\". Another word for a spectacularly stupid (or contemptible) person is \"dipshit\". Shithead is also the name of a card game.\nPositive attitude.\nIn North American slang, prefixing the article \"the\" to \"shit\" gives it a completely opposite definition, meaning \"the best\", as in, for example \"Altered Beast is the shit\". Other slang words of the same meaning, such as \"crap\", are not used in such locutions.\nTo wear a \"shit-eating grin\" means the person wearing it may be displaying self-satisfaction, smugness, embarrassment, or mischief. It may also be a playful evasion, as a response to the query \"I'll bet you drank the whole bottle of booze yourself, didn't you?\"\nShortening of \"bullshit\".\nThe expression \"no shit?\" (a contraction of \"no bullshit?\") is used in response to a statement that is extraordinary or hard to believe. Alternatively the maker of the hard-to-believe statement may add \"no shit\" to reinforce the sincerity or truthfulness of their statement, particularly in response to someone expressing disbelief at their statement. \"No shit\" is also used sarcastically in response to a statement of the obvious, as in \"no shit, Sherlock\".\nIn this form the word can also be used in phrases such as \"don't give me that shit\" or \"you're full of shit\". The term \"full of shit\" is often used as an exclamation to charge someone who is believed to be prone to dishonesty, exaggeration or is thought to be \"phoney\" with an accusation. For example:\nThe word \"bullshit\" also denotes false or insincere discourse. (\"Horseshit\" is roughly equivalent, while \"chickenshit\" means \"cowardly\", \"batshit\" indicates a person is crazy, and \"going apeshit\" indicates a person is entering a state of high excitement or unbridled rage.) \"Are you shitting me?!\" is a question sometimes given in response to an incredible assertion. An answer that reasserts the veracity of the claim is, \"I shit you not\".\nEmphasis.\nPerhaps the only constant connotation that \"shit\" reliably carries is that its referent holds some degree of emotional intensity for the speaker. Whether offense is taken at hearing the word varies greatly according to listener and situation, and is related to age and social class: elderly speakers and those of (or aspiring to) higher socioeconomic strata tend to use it more privately and selectively than younger and more blue-collar speakers.\nLike the word \"fuck\", \"shit\" is often used to add emphasis more than to add meaning, for example, \"shit! I was so shit-scared of that shithead that I shit-talked him into dropping out of the karate match!\" The term \"to shit-talk\" connotes bragging or exaggeration (whereas \"to talk shit\" primarily means \"to gossip [about someone in a damaging way]\" or to talk in a boastful way about things which are erroneous in nature), but in such constructions as the above, the word \"shit\" often functions as an interjection.\nThe exclamation \"holy shit\" derives its force from the juxtaposition of the sacred with the profane.\nUnlike the word \"fuck\", \"shit\" is not used emphatically with \"-ing\" or as an infix. For example; \"I lost the shitting karate match\" would be replaced with \"...thefucking karate match\". Similarly, while \"in-fucking-credible\" is generally acceptable, \"in-shitting-credible\" is not.\nThe verb \"to shit\".\nThe preterite and past participle of \"shit\" are attested as \"shat\", \"shit\", or \"shitted\", depending on dialect and, sometimes, the rhythm of the sentence. In the prologue of \"The Canterbury Tales\", \"shitten\" is used as the past participle; however this form is not used in modern English. In American English \"shit\" as a past participle is often correct, while \"shat\" is generally acceptable and \"shitted\" is uncommon and missing from the \"Random House\" and \"American Heritage\" dictionaries.\n\"to shitcan\".\nTo shitcan someone or something is to dismiss or dispose of casually or unceremoniously, as into a waste basket. Shitcan can also be used as a noun: \"Don't bother; a report like this is gonna go directly into the shitcan.\" It can also refer to being fired from a job: \"The boss is gonna shitcan you if you keep showing up late.\"\nBackronyms.\nThe backronym form \"S.H.I.T.\" often figures into jokes, like \"Special High Intensity Training\" (a well-known joke used in job applications), \"Special Hot Interdiction Team\" (a mockery on SWAT), any college name that begins with an S-H (like \"South Harmon Institute of Technology\" in the film \"Accepted\" (2006), and \"Ship High In Transit\" (or the variant \"Store High In Transit\" in the film \"Kenny\" (2006)). \"South Hudson Institute of Technology\" has sometimes been used to describe the United States Military Academy at West Point.\nIn polite company, sometimes backronyms such as \"Sugar Honey in Tea\" or \"Sugar Honey Ice(d) Tea\" are used.\nUsage in classical poetry.\nSatirist Jonathan Swift wrote a controversial poem \"The Lady's Dressing Room\" containing the following lines (115 through 118):\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nUsage on television.\nCanada.\nIn Canada, \"shit\" is one of the words considered by the Canadian Broadcast Standards Council to be \"coarse, offensive language intended for adults\", acceptable for broadcast only after 9:00\u00a0p.m.\nOn the Canadian Showcase television show \"Trailer Park Boys\", characters frequently use the term \"shit\". For example, the fictional trailer park supervisor James \"Jim\" Lahey employs many metaphors with the negative slang \"shit\" bizarrely worked in; in one episode, Mr. Lahey likens Ricky's growing ignorance to that of a \"shit tsunami\", while in another episode, Mr. Lahey tells Bubbles the \"shit hawks are swooping in low\" due to his deplorable behavior and company. The term \"shit\" is also used in the titles of that show's episodes, themselves, e.g., \"The Winds of Shit\", \"A Shit Leopard Can't Change Its Spots\", and \"Never Cry Shitwolf\".\nUnited Kingdom.\nThe first person to say \"shit\" on British TV was John Cleese of the \"Monty Python\" comedy troupe, in the late 1960s, according to his own eulogy for Graham Chapman. However, this is not independently verified. The phrase \"thick as pigshit\" is used in the 1969 BBC play \"The Big Flame\". The word \"shit\" also appears in the British film \"Cul-de-sac\" (1966), which might pre-date John Cleese's use.\nUnited States.\nThe word has become increasingly acceptable on American cable television and satellite radio, which are not subject to FCC regulation. In other English-speaking countries, such as Canada, the United Kingdom, the Republic of Ireland, Australia, and New Zealand, the word is allowed to be used in broadcast television by the regulative councils of each area, as long as it is used in late hours when young people are not expected to be watching. It has appeared on ABC News' \"20/20\".\n\"Shit\" was one of the original \"Seven Words You Can Never Say On TV\", a comedy routine by the American comedian George Carlin. In the United States, although the use of the word is censored on broadcast network television (while its synonym \"crap\" is not usually subject to censorship), the FCC permitted some exceptions. For example:\nAn episode of \"South Park\", \"It Hits the Fan\" (original airdate 20 June 2001), parodied the hype over the \"Chicago Hope\" episode. In it, \"shit\" is used 162 times, and a counter in the corner of the screen tallies the repetitions (excluding the 38 instances of the word's use in written forms, raising the total to an even 200). \"South Park\" airs on American cable networks, which are outside the FCC's regulatory jurisdiction and whose censorship of vulgar dialogue is at the discretion of the cable operators.\nSince that episode, the word (as well as many on-screen depictions of feces, as well as defecation) has become a mainstay of \"South Park\". Various episodes also feature a character, Mr. Hankey, who is a sentient piece of excrement. Other Comedy Central series, along with programming on other cable networks including FX, TBS, and as of March 2014, Adult Swim, also regularly employ the word shit. Episodes of \"Graceland\", on the USA Network, do also.\nUsage in radio.\nUnited States.\nUnlike satellite radio, American terrestrial radio stations must abide by FCC guidelines on obscenity to avoid punitive fines. These guidelines do not define exactly what constitutes obscenity, but it has been interpreted by some commissioners as including any form of words like \"shit\" and \"fuck\", for whatever use.\nDespite this, the word has been featured in popular songs that have appeared on broadcast radio in cases where the usage of the word is not audibly clear to the casual listener, or on live television. For example:\nSome notable instances of censorship of the word from broadcast television and radio include:\nUsage in campaigns.\nSanitation promotion.\nUsing the term \"shit\" (or other locally used crude words) \u2013 rather than feces or excreta \u2013 during campaigns and triggering events is a deliberate aspect of the community-led total sanitation approach which aims to stop open defecation, a massive public health problem in developing countries.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "38223", "revid": "50883694", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=38223", "title": "Engineer", "text": "Practitioner of engineering\nAn engineer is a practitioner of engineering. The word \"engineer\" (Latin , the origin of the Ir. in the title of engineer in countries like Belgium, The Netherlands, and Indonesia) is derived from the Latin words (\"to contrive, devise\") and (\"cleverness\"). The foundational qualifications of a licensed professional engineer typically include a four-year bachelor's degree in an engineering discipline, or in some jurisdictions, a master's degree in an engineering discipline plus four to six years of peer-reviewed professional practice (culminating in a project report or thesis) and passage of engineering board examinations.\nThe work of engineers forms the link between scientific discoveries and their subsequent applications to human and business needs and quality of life.\nDefinition.\nIn 1961, the Conference of Engineering Societies of Western Europe and the United States of America defined \"professional engineer\" as follows:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;A professional engineer is competent by virtue of his/her fundamental education and training to apply the scientific method and outlook to the analysis and solution of engineering problems. He/she is able to assume personal responsibility for the development and application of engineering science and knowledge, notably in research, design, construction, manufacturing, superintending, managing, and in the education of the engineer. His/her work is predominantly intellectual and varied and not of a routine mental or physical character. It requires the exercise of original thought and judgment and the ability to supervise the technical and administrative work of others. His/her education will have been such as to make him/her capable of closely and continuously following progress in his/her branch of engineering science by consulting newly published works on a worldwide basis, assimilating such information, and applying it independently. He/she is thus placed in a position to make contributions to the development of engineering science or its applications. His/her education and training will have been such that he/she will have acquired a broad and general appreciation of the engineering sciences as well as thorough insight into the special features of his/her own branch. In due time he/she will be able to give authoritative technical advice and assume responsibility for the direction of important tasks in his/her branch.\nRoles and expertise.\nDesign.\nEngineers develop new technological solutions. During the engineering design process, the responsibilities of the engineer may include defining problems, conducting and narrowing research, analyzing criteria, finding and analyzing solutions, and making decisions. Much of an engineer's time is spent on researching, locating, applying, and transferring information. Indeed, research suggests engineers spend 56% of their time engaged in various information behaviours, including 14% actively searching for information.\nEngineers must weigh different design choices on their merits and choose the solution that best matches the requirements and needs. Their crucial and unique task is to identify, understand, and interpret the constraints on a design in order to produce a successful result. Good problem solving skills are an important asset for engineers.\nAnalysis.\nEngineers apply techniques of engineering analysis in testing, production, or maintenance. Analytical engineers may supervise production in factories and elsewhere, determine the causes of a process failure, and test output to maintain quality. They also estimate the time and cost required to complete projects. Supervisory engineers are responsible for major components or entire projects. Engineering analysis involves the application of scientific analytic principles and processes to reveal the properties and state of the system, device or mechanism under study. Engineering analysis proceeds by separating the engineering design into the mechanisms of operation or failure, analyzing or estimating each component of the operation or failure mechanism in isolation, and recombining the components. They may analyze risk.\nMany engineers use computers to produce and analyze designs, to simulate and test how a machine, structure, or system operates, to generate specifications for parts, to monitor the quality of products, and to control the efficiency of processes.\nSpecialization and management.\nMost engineers specialize in one or more engineering disciplines. Numerous specialties are recognized by professional societies, and each of the major branches of engineering has numerous subdivisions. Civil engineering, for example, includes structural engineering, along with transportation engineering, geotechnical engineering, and materials engineering, including ceramic, metallurgical, and polymer engineering. Mechanical engineering cuts across most disciplines since its core essence is applied physics. Engineers also may specialize in one industry, such as motor vehicles, or in one type of technology, such as turbines or semiconductor materials.\nSeveral recent studies have investigated how engineers spend their time; that is, the work tasks they perform and how their time is distributed among these. Research suggests that there are several key themes present in engineers' work: technical work (i.e., the application of science to product development), social work (i.e., interactive communication between people), computer-based work and information behaviors. Among other more detailed findings, a 2012 work sampling study found that engineers spend 62.92% of their time engaged in technical work, 40.37% in social work, and 49.66% in computer-based work. Furthermore, there was considerable overlap between these different types of work, with engineers spending 24.96% of their time engaged in technical and social work, 37.97% in technical and non-social, 15.42% in non-technical and social, and 21.66% in non-technical and non-social.\nEngineering is also an information-intensive field, with research finding that engineers spend 55.8% of their time engaged in various different information behaviors, including 14.2% actively seeking information from other people (7.8%) and information repositories such as documents and databases (6.4%).\nThe time engineers spend engaged in such activities is also reflected in the competencies required in engineering roles. In addition to engineers' core technical competence, research has also demonstrated the critical nature of their personal attributes, project management skills, and cognitive abilities to success in the role.\nTypes of engineers.\nThere are many branches of engineering, each of which specializes in specific technologies and products. Typically, engineers will have deep knowledge in one area and basic knowledge in related areas. For example, mechanical engineering curricula typically include introductory courses in electrical engineering, computer science, materials science, metallurgy, mathematics, and software engineering.\nAn engineer may either be hired for a firm that requires engineers on a continuous basis, or may belong to an engineering firm that provides engineering consulting services to other firms.\nWhen developing a product, engineers typically work in interdisciplinary teams. For example, when building robots an engineering team will typically have at least three types of engineers. A mechanical engineer would design the body and actuators. An electrical engineer would design the power systems, sensors, electronics, embedded software in electronics, and control circuitry. Finally, a software engineer would develop the software that makes the robot behave properly. Engineers that aspire to management engage in further study in business administration, project management and organizational or business psychology. Often engineers move up the management hierarchy from managing projects, functional departments, and divisions, and some eventually become CEOs of multi-national corporations.\nEthics.\nEngineers have obligations to the public, their clients, employers, and the profession. Many engineering societies have established codes of practice and codes of ethics to guide members and inform the public at large. Each engineering discipline and professional society maintains a code of ethics, which the members pledge to uphold. Depending on their specializations, engineers may also be governed by specific statute, whistleblowing, product liability laws, and often the principles of business ethics.\nSome graduates of engineering programs in North America may be recognized by the iron ring or Engineer's Ring, a ring made of iron or stainless steel that is worn on the little finger of the dominant hand. This tradition began in 1925 in Canada with The Ritual of the Calling of an Engineer, where the ring serves as a symbol and reminder of the engineer's obligations to the engineering profession. In 1972, the practice was adopted by several colleges in the United States including members of the Order of the Engineer.\nEducation.\nMost engineering programs involve a concentration of study in an engineering specialty, along with courses in both mathematics and the physical and life sciences. Many programs also include courses in general engineering and applied accounting. A design course, often accompanied by a computer or laboratory class or both, is part of the curriculum of most programs. Often, general courses not directly related to engineering, such as those in the social sciences or humanities, also are required.\nAccreditation is the process by which engineering programs are evaluated by an external body to determine if applicable standards are met. The Washington Accord serves as an international accreditation agreement for academic engineering degrees, recognizing the substantial equivalency in the standards set by many major national engineering bodies. In the United States, post-secondary degree programs in engineering are accredited by the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology.\nRegulation.\nIn many countries, engineering tasks such as the design of bridges, electric power plants, industrial equipment, machine design and chemical plants, must be approved by a licensed professional engineer. Most commonly titled professional engineer is a license to practice and is indicated with the use of post-nominal letters; PE or P.Eng. These are common in North America, as is European engineer (EUR ING) in Europe.\nIn the United States, engineering is a regulated profession whose practice and practitioners are licensed and governed by law. Licensure is generally attainable through combination of education, pre-examination (Fundamentals of Engineering exam), examination (professional engineering exam), and engineering experience (typically in the area of 5+ years). Each state tests and licenses professional engineers. Currently, most states do not license by specific engineering discipline, but rather provide generalized licensure, and trust engineers to use professional judgment regarding their individual competencies; this is the favoured approach of the professional societies. Despite this, at least one of the examinations required by most states is actually focused on a particular discipline; candidates for licensure typically choose the category of examination which comes closest to their respective expertise. In the United States, an \"industrial exemption\" allows businesses to employ employees and call them an \"engineer\", as long as such individuals are under the direct supervision and control of the business entity and function internally related to manufacturing (manufactured parts) related to the business entity, or work internally within an exempt organization. Such person does not have the final authority to approve, or the ultimate responsibility for, engineering designs, plans, or specifications that are to be incorporated into fixed works, systems, or facilities on the property of others or made available to the public. These individuals are prohibited from offering engineering services directly to the public or other businesses, or engage in practice of engineering unless the business entity is registered with the state's board of engineering, and the practice is carried on or supervised directly only by engineers licensed to engage in the practice of engineering. In some instances, some positions, such as a \"sanitation engineer\", does not have any basis in engineering sciences. Although some states require a BS degree in engineering accredited by the Engineering Accreditation Commission (EAC) of Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET) with no exceptions, about two thirds of the states accept BS degrees in engineering technology accredited by the Engineering Technology Accreditation Commission (ETAC) of ABET to become licensed as professional engineers. Each state has different requirements on years of experience to take the Fundamentals of Engineering (FE) and Professional Engineering (PE) exams. A few states require a graduate MS in engineering to sit for the exams as further learning. After seven years of working after graduation, two years of responsibility for significant engineering work, continuous professional development, some highly qualified PEs are able to become International Professional Engineers Int(PE). These engineers must meet the highest level of professional competencies and this is a peer-reviewed process. Once the IntPE title is awarded, the engineer can gain easier admission to national registers of a number of members jurisdictions for international practice.\nIn Canada, engineering is a self-regulated profession. The profession in each province is governed by its own engineering association. For instance, in the province of British Columbia an engineering graduate with four or more years of post graduate experience in an engineering-related field and passing exams in ethics and law will need to be registered by the Association for Professional Engineers and Geoscientists (APEGBC) in order to become a Professional Engineer and be granted the professional designation of P.Eng allowing one to practice engineering.\nIn Continental Europe, Latin America, Turkey, and elsewhere the title is limited by law to people with an engineering degree and the use of the title by others is illegal. In Italy, the title is limited to people who hold an engineering degree, have passed a professional qualification examination (\"Esame di Stato\") and are enrolled in the register of the local branch of National Associations of Engineers (a public body). In Portugal, professional engineer titles and accredited engineering degrees are regulated and certified by the \"Ordem dos Engenheiros\". In the Czech Republic, the title \"engineer\" (Ing.) is given to people with a (master's) degree in chemistry, technology or economics for historical and traditional reasons. In Greece, the academic title of \"Diploma Engineer\" is awarded after completion of the five-year engineering study course and the title of \"Certified Engineer\" is awarded after completion of the four-year course of engineering studies at a Technological Educational Institute (TEI).\nDefinition by country.\nThe definition of the term \"engineer\" varies across countries and continents.\nAsia and Africa.\nIn the Indian subcontinent, Russia, Middle East, Africa, and China, engineering is one of the most sought-after undergraduate courses, for which entrance examinations are highly competitive.\nIn Egypt, the educational system makes engineering the second-most respected profession in the country (after medicine); engineering colleges at Egyptian universities require extremely high marks on the General Certificate of Secondary Education ( \"al-Th\u0101nawiyyah al-`\u0100mmah\") \u2013 in the order of 97 or 98 per cent \u2013 and are thus considered (along with the colleges of medicine, natural science, and pharmacy) to be among the \"pinnacle colleges\" ( \"kull\u012by\u0101t al-qimmah\").\nIn the Philippines and Filipino communities overseas, engineers who are either Filipino or not, especially those who also profess other jobs at the same time, are addressed and introduced as \"Engineer\", rather than \"Sir/Madam\" in speech or \"Mr./Mrs./Ms.\" (\"G./Gng./Bb.\" in Filipino) before surnames. That word is used either in itself or before the given name or surname.\nEurope.\nAs of 2022[ [update]], thirty two countries in Europe (including nearly all 27 countries of the EU) now recognise the title of \"European Engineer\" which permits the use of the pre-nominal title of \"EUR ING\" (always fully capitalised). Each country sets its own precise qualification requirement for the use of the title (though they are all broadly equivalent). Holding the requisite qualification does not afford automatic entitlement. The title has to be applied for (and the appropriate fee paid). The holder is entitled to use the title in their passport. EUR INGs are allowed to describe themselves as professionally qualified engineers and practise as such in any of the 32 participating countries including those where the title of engineer is regulated by law.\nFrance.\nIn France, the term (engineer) is not a protected title and can be used by anyone who practices this profession.\nHowever, the title (graduate engineer) is an official academic title that is protected by the government and is associated with the \"Dipl\u00f4me d'Ing\u00e9nieur\", which is a renowned academic degree in France. Anyone misusing this title in France can be fined a large sum and jailed, as it is usually reserved for graduates of French engineering \"grandes \u00e9coles\". Engineering schools which were created during the French revolution have a special reputation among the French people, as they helped to make the transition from a mostly agricultural country of late 18th century to the industrially developed France of the 19th century. A great part of 19th-century France's economic wealth and industrial prowess was created by engineers that have graduated from \u00c9cole Centrale Paris, \u00c9cole des Mines de Paris, \u00c9cole polytechnique or T\u00e9l\u00e9com Paris. This was also the case after WWII when France had to be rebuilt. Before the \"r\u00e9forme Ren\u00e9 Haby\" in the 1970s, it was very difficult to be admitted to such schools, and the French were commonly perceived as the nation's \u00e9lite. However, after the Haby reform and a series of further reforms (Modernization plans of French universities), several engineering schools were created which can be accessed with relatively lower competition.\nEngineering positions in France are now shared between the graduating from engineering and the holders of a master's degree in science from public universities.\nItaly.\nIn Italy, only people who hold a formal engineering qualification of at least a bachelor's degree are permitted to describe themselves as an engineer. So much so that people holding such qualifications are entitled to use the pre-nominal title of \" (or \" if female - in both cases often abbreviated to \"Ing.\") in lieu of \"Signore\", \"Signorina\" or \"Signora\" (Mr, Miss and Mrs respectively) in the same manner as someone holding a doctorate would use the pre-nominal title \"Doctor\".\nUnited Kingdom.\nIn the UK, the practice of engineering is not a regulated profession but control of the titles of chartered engineer (CEng) and incorporated engineer (IEng) is regulated. These titles are protected by law and are subject to strict requirements defined by the Engineering Council. The title CEng is in use in nations of the Commonwealth of Nations that follow or adapt British professional codes.\nMany skilled and semi-skilled tradespeople in the UK, including, for example, engineering technicians who service domestic appliances or telephone systems, call themselves engineers, and the term in that context is commonly used by the public. Proposals such as a 2015 petition to the UK parliament to legally protect the title \"engineer\" so that only professional engineers could use it have been unsuccessful (as of 2023[ [update]])\nNorth America.\nCanada.\nIn Canada, engineering is a regulated profession whose practice and practitioners are licensed and governed by law. Licensed professional engineers are referred to as P.Eng. Many Canadian engineers wear an Iron Ring.\nIn all Canadian provinces, the title \"Professional Engineer\" is protected by law and any non-licensed individual or company using the title is committing a legal offence and is subject to fines and restraining orders. Contrary to insistence from the Professional Engineers Ontario (\"PEO\") and Engineers Canada, use of the title \"Engineer\" itself has been found by Canadian law to be acceptable by those not holding P.Eng. titles.\nThe title of engineer is not exclusive to P.Eng titles. The title of Engineer is commonly held by \"Software Engineer\", the Canadian Military as various ranks and positions, railway locomotive engineers, Stationary engineer and Aircraft Maintenance Engineers (AME), all of which do not commonly hold a P.Eng. designation.\nUnited States.\nIn the United States, the practice of professional engineering is highly regulated and the title \"professional engineer\" is legally protected, meaning that it is unlawful to use it to offer engineering services to the public unless permission, certification or other official endorsement is specifically granted by that state through a professional engineering license.\nSpanish-speaking countries.\nCertain Spanish-speaking countries follow the Italian convention of engineers using the pre-nominal title, in this case \" (or \" if female). Like in Italy, it is usually abbreviated to \"Ing.\" In Spain this practice is not followed.\nThe engineering profession enjoys high prestige in Spain, ranking close to medical doctors, scientists and professors, and above judges, journalists or entrepreneurs, according to a 2014 study.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Sister-inline/styles.css\"/&gt; Media related to at Wikimedia Commons"}

{"id": "38226", "revid": "20957809", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=38226", "title": "Transportation in Boston", "text": "Transportation in Boston includes roadway, subway, regional rail, air, and sea options for passenger and freight transit in Boston, Massachusetts. The Massachusetts Port Authority (Massport) operates the Port of Boston, which includes a container shipping facility in South Boston, and Logan International Airport, in East Boston. The Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA) operates bus, subway, short-distance rail, and water ferry passenger services throughout the city and region. Amtrak operates passenger rail service to and from major Northeastern cities, and a major bus terminal at South Station is served by varied intercity bus companies. The city is bisected by major highways I-90 and I-93, the intersection of which has undergone a major renovation, nicknamed the Big Dig.\nRoad transportation.\nRoad infrastructure.\nExcept for the Back Bay and part of the South Boston neighborhoods, Boston has no street grid. The City of Boston, composed of many smaller towns annexed over the years, retained most of the pre-existing street names, resulting in many duplicates throughout the city.\nExpressways and freeways in and around Greater Boston are laid out with two circumferential expressways: Interstate 495 and Route 128. The circumferential routes are intersected by several radial highways, including:\nBy the early 1990s, traffic on the elevated downtown portions of I-93 and Route 1 (the Central Artery) was 190,000 vehicles per day, with an accident rate four times the national average for urban interstates. Traffic was bumper-to-bumper for six to eight hours per day, with projections of traffic jams doubling by 2010. Also, the elevated structure itself was decaying, after more than a half century of continuous use. For most of the 1990s and early 2000s, driving in Boston was disrupted by the Big Dig, the most expensive (roughly $14 billion) road project in the history of the US.\nAfter more than 15 years of disruption, The Big Dig, along with other highway projects, provided less than 10 years of relief before congestion returned to the levels seen in \"prerecession 2005, when the Big Dig was almost complete and marketed as the solution to gridlock for commuters ... analyses would conclude that the added capacity attracted more drivers, and pushed the traffic bottlenecks farther into the suburbs.\" However even without the big dig the raised road was structurally deficient and needed rebuilding or replacement.\nBoston remains one of the most congested metropolitan areas in the US. The complex and still-changing road network, with many one-way streets and time-based traffic restrictions, has led many Boston travelers to consider an up-to-date GPS navigation map system a necessity.\nWalking and bicycling.\nBoston is known to travel agents as \"America's Walking City\", has been rated as the third most walkable city in the US by Walk Score, and also has a high Transit Score.\nBoston is a compact city, sized right for walking or bicycling. According to a \"Prevention\" magazine report in 2003, the city has the highest percentage of on-foot commuters of any city in the United States. In 2000, 13.36% of Boston commuters walked to work according to the US Census. This was the highest of any major US city, bested only by college towns such as nearby Cambridge. Most of the area's cities and towns have standing committees devoted to improvements to the bicycle and pedestrian environment. The first pedestrian advocacy organization in the United States, WalkBoston, was started in Boston in 1990, and helped start the national pedestrian advocacy organization America Walks.\nCycling is popular in Boston, for both recreation and commuting. Some bicycle paths are marked on some roadways, but very few completely separated paths are available to cyclists. The Minuteman Bikeway (which runs through several suburbs northwest of Boston) and the Charles River bike paths are popular with recreational cyclists and tourists. The Emerald Necklace system of parklands and parkways, pioneered by Frederick Law Olmsted and his sons, provides some more pleasant alternative routes for cyclists. The Southwest Corridor also provides cycling infrastructure, as does the East Boston Greenway. Many MBTA riders use a bicycle to get to a nearby station, and the number of bicycle racks and lockers has been increased.\nHowever \"Bicycling\" magazine, in its March 2006 issue, named the city as one of its three worst cities in the United States for cycling. The distinction was earned for \"lousy roads, scarce and unconnected bike lanes and bike-friendly gestures from City Hall that go nowhere\u2014such as hiring a bike coordinator in 2001, only to cut the position two years later\". Neighboring Cambridge earned an honorable mention as one of the best cities for cycling with a population of 75,000-200,000.\nSince September 2007, when Mayor Thomas Menino started a bicycle program called Boston Bikes with a goal of improving bicycling conditions by adding bike lanes and racks and offering bikeshare programs, the city has improved accommodations for bicyclists in a number of ways. The least visible improvement is zoning and building code changes to encourage showering and locker facilities in major office buildings. Better signage and lane markings for bicyclists are starting to appear. More visible enforcement of traffic regulations on motorists, bicyclists, and pedestrians has commenced.\nBoston has an active Critical Mass ride group, and MassBike is a bike advocacy group active in supporting cyclists in the area. The LivableStreets Alliance, headquartered in Cambridge, is an advocacy group for bicyclists, pedestrians, and walkable neighborhoods.\nMaps and guides.\nThe Boston regional Metropolitan Area Planning Council (MAPC) publishes a large and detailed \"Greater Boston Cycling &amp; Walking Map\", which it distributes free of charge. The map is also available online and in downloadable form, and revisions are solicited from the general public.\nIn addition, a small private company called Rubel BikeMaps has for many years published and distributed an extensive lineup of books and maps covering Boston, the state of Massachusetts, and nearby areas of New England. These publications are for sale at many bicycle shops, and online. Because of recent expansion of bike lanes and other facilities, plus increased input from the public, it is important to use the most recent editions of these maps and guides.\nRubel BikeMaps also publishes \"Car-Free in Boston:a Guide for Locals and Visitors\", still in its 10th edition as of 2015[ [update]]. Prepared by the Association for Public Transportation (APT), this book contains extensive information useful to bicyclists and pedestrians alike, including coverage of intermodal travel and handicapped accessibility. Although the general overview and travel tips are largely still relevant, this classic book has not been updated since 2003, and must be supplemented by current online information.\nWith widespread use of smartphones and tablet computers, online mapping services such as Google Maps have become popular aids for pedestrians, cyclists, and motorists. The MBTA was one of the earliest large transit agencies to embrace the Open Data philosophy, making route, scheduling, and real-time vehicle location information publicly available in the standard GTFS format. As a result, many third-party apps are available on a number of hardware platforms, allowing riders a wide range of choices in obtaining travel information. Google Maps has started to present maps of the interiors of underground subway stations, and this information is available on Android and iOS smartphones, as well as web browsers.\nBuses.\n162 MBTA bus routes operate within the Greater Boston area, with a combined ridership of approximately 375,000 one-way trips per day, making it the seventh-busiest local bus agency in the country. The bus fare is $1.70 with a CharlieCard, or $2 with a CharlieTicket or cash; monthly commuter passes are available, as are reduced fare transfers between most bus lines and the subway.\nIn an effort to provide service intermediate in speed and capacity between subways and buses, the MBTA has begun projects using bus rapid transit (BRT) technology. The MBTA has one BRT line, the Silver Line, although this operates in two discontinuous sections. The Silver Line operates in part via dedicated trolleybus tunnel, in part via on-street reserved bus lanes, and in part mixed with general street traffic. Service through the trolleybus tunnel is by dual-mode buses, which operate electrically in the tunnel and within a short section on the surface, and which use diesel power for the rest of the route.\nMassport operates the Logan Express, an express bus service between Logan International Airport and suburban park-and-ride lots.\nSeveral privately owned commuter bus services take passengers between the city and suburbs. Transportation Management Associations also run public shuttles to specific employment centers, such as the EZ Ride for Kendall Square; and the Route 128 Business Council shuttles around Alewife, Needham, and Waltham; Partners HealthCare runs public shuttles among its locations. The MASCO TMA operates six commuter shuttles for the use of Longwood Medical Area employees and students run by the MASCO TMA for the Longwood Medical Area. The MASCO M2 shuttle between Harvard Square and the LMA via Massachusetts Avenue is available for public use, though tickets or cash card must be purchased in advance. Many colleges and universities also run private shuttles for students and employees.\nIn June 2014, the Cambridge-based startup Bridj began running \"data driven\" bus service in core neighborhoods. It uses a mixture of fixed and dynamic routes and pricing, depending on where and when registered members say they want to go.\nParking.\nSince automobiles did not exist in 1630, when Boston was first settled, parking was not a consideration. The city that sprung up around and away from the original North End neighborhood accommodates cars only awkwardly; parking comes at a premium throughout the city. Off-street parking spaces have sold for more than $160,000 on Beacon Hill. On-street parking is the norm in many sections, and the city created a resident permit parking program to reserve street space for permanent residents in certain neighborhoods. The parking permits are free to Boston residents, however, and the program is overused; permitted spaces remain scarce. Meters citywide are priced at $1.25 per hour, and metered spaces are also often difficult to find.\nThe number of public parking spaces downtown has been capped since the mid-1970s. The number of parking spaces in East and South Boston, and the hours that they may be used, also is restricted by state regulation. This is part of the state Department of Environmental Protection's plan, approved by the United States Environmental Protection Agency to address the non-compliance of the region with the mandatory National Ambient Air Quality Standards for ozone.\nThe MBTA operates several large park and ride facilities on its subway and commuter rail lines, close to major highways, providing access to downtown. While most of these tend to fill up with commuters on weekday mornings, they provide a good place for visitors to leave their cars and see the city without parking hassles on evenings and weekends.\nRail transportation.\nBoston has two discrete rail networks. One of these, the MBTA, widely nicknamed \"the T\", includes elements of light rail/streetcar operation as well as traditional subway technology. (The Red, Orange, Blue, and Green Lines have no physical rail interconnections with each other, though they are all operated by the MBTA and exchange passengers in shared stations.) The second network forms the Boston area portion of the North American rail network, and provides commuter rail, intercity passenger rail and freight rail services.\nAlthough the two networks are essentially unconnected, they do in some places run alongside each other in the same right of way. Interchange stations allow interchange of passengers, but not trains, between subway and commuter rail services. Parts of the subway network also use former common user rail rights of way.\nSubway network.\nBoston has the oldest subway system in North America, with the first underground streetcar traffic dating back to 1897. Today the whole subway network is owned and operated by the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA).\nIn the early 1960s, the then-newly-formed MBTA hired Cambridge Seven Associates to help develop a new brand identity. Cambridge Seven came up with a circled T to represent such concepts as \"transit\", \"transportation\" and \"tunnel.\" Today, Bostonians call their rapid transit network \"the T\", and it is the fourth busiest in the country, with daily ridership of 273,000 trips on its heavy rail and 90,700 on its light rail. This compares with the Washington Metro's heavy rail daily ridership of 326,300, the Chicago 'L\"s 334,200, and Los Angeles's 76,800, but is overshadowed by New York City's 6.335 million average daily weekday trips.\nThe one-way fare is $2.40. Monthly commuter passes, and day and week visitor's passes are also available for purchase. There are four subway lines in the metropolitan Boston area: the Red Line, Green\u00a0Line, Orange Line, and Blue Line. The colors of each line have a symbolic meaning: the Blue Line runs under Boston Harbor; the Red Line used to terminate at Harvard University (whose school color is crimson); the Orange Line used to run along Washington Street, which was once called Orange Street; and the Green Line runs along parts of the Emerald Necklace into the leafy suburbs of Brookline and Newton.\nThe Green Line is actually four different lines; it starts as one trunk line but then splits into four different branches, the B (Boston College), C (Cleveland Circle), D (Riverside) and E (Heath Street) trains. Because the split is only relevant on the outbound direction of travel, one may take any train inbound, but when going outbound one must be careful to board the correct train. The Red Line splits as well, with southbound trains going either to Braintree or Ashmont.\nThough most of Boston's rapid transit network is powered via third rail, the outermost portions of the Blue Line, as well as all of the Green Line and Mattapan Line, are powered via overhead lines. The name \"subway\" is something of a misnomer; as with other systems, large segments run above ground when far from the city's downtown. Additionally, the Green and Mattapan Lines are technically light-rail services, using LRVs and streetcars rather than typical multiple unit heavy railcar equipment. The Ashmont\u2013Mattapan line uses refurbished classic pre-war \"PCC\" trolleys on an exclusive right of way; the Green Line relies on modern high-capacity LRV cars from Japan and Italy.\nLike the New York City Subway, Boston's subway system in theory does keep to an exact fixed schedule. Starting around 2011, the MBTA introduced overhead displays at the train platform level which indicate estimated arrival times for the next two trains in each direction. In addition, real-time information about train location (and bus location) is available via an Open Data protocol on the Internet, enabling a large number of third-party smartphone apps and web sites to display expected arrival times throughout the MBTA system. The Green Line relies more on operators than its signal system compared to other lines, especially where trams are driven across or even in automobile lanes on surface rails. Due to a sparsity of data collected by the existing system, real-time Green Line arrival predictions are not expected until tracking infrastructure upgrades are completed in 2015.\nElevated sections.\nDespite the first rapid transit segment being built underground, many later parts were built as elevated railways. A century later, most of these elevated railway sections have been replaced by cut or tunnel routing. The only remaining classic elevated structures are the Green Line's Lechmere Viaduct, including the Science Park and Lechmere stations, and a short segment of the Red Line at Charles-MGH, connecting the tunnel under Beacon Hill to the Longfellow Bridge.\nThe Boston Elevated Railway was the company that owned all the elevateds and subways. The following Els once existed:\nCommon user rail network.\nUnlike the subway, which is owned and operated by the MBTA, the common user network is owned and operated by a mixture of various public and private sector bodies. In the Boston area, trackage is owned by a mixture of the MBTA and several freight railroads. Commuter rail services are operated by the Keolis Commuter Services (KCS) under contract to the MBTA, intercity passenger services are operated by Amtrak, and freight services are operated by the various freight railroads. Trackage rights allow trains of one operator to make use of tracks owned by another.\nCommuter rail.\nThe MBTA commuter rail system brings people from as far away as Worcester and Providence (Rhode Island) into Boston. There are approximately 125,000 one-way trips on the commuter rail each day, making it the fifth-busiest commuter rail system in the country, outranked only by the various systems serving New York and Chicago suburbs.\nThere are two major rail terminals in Boston: North Station and South Station. Commuter rail lines from the North Shore and northwestern suburbs begin and terminate at North Station; lines from the South Shore and the west start and end at South Station. There is no direct rail connection between North Station and South Station, so that interchange between the two stations generally requires the use of two different subway lines (Red/Orange or Red/Green). However, passengers on commuter lines serving Back Bay Station can interchange directly from there to North Station using the Orange Line, and passengers on the Fitchburg Line can interchange directly from Porter to South Station using the Red Line.\nIntercity rail.\nBoston is served by four intercity rail services, all operated by Amtrak. The \"Acela\" and \"Northeast Regional\" services both operate on the Northeast Corridor to and from Washington, D.C., with stops in places such as New York City and Philadelphia. A branch of the \"Lake Shore Limited\" service operates to and from Chicago. The \"Downeaster\" service operates to and from Brunswick, Maine.\nThe Northeast Corridor services terminate at South Station, as does the \"Lake Shore Limited\". The \"Downeaster\" service terminates at North Station, primarily because the \"Downeaster\" Amtrak line is intended for points north of downtown. The Northeast Corridor and \"Lake Shore Limited\" services also stop at Back Bay station. The lack of a direct rail connection between North Station and South Station means that passengers transferring to and from the \"Downeaster\" are faced with a transfer between stations. Although most such transfers can be achieved using the Orange Line between Back Bay and North Station, Amtrak recommends passengers with luggage to use a taxi.\nWithin the Boston area, most Amtrak services operate over commuter rail track owned by the MBTA, who also own the Northeast Corridor track as far as the Rhode Island state line.\nMajor transit hubs.\nThere are several major transit terminals in the Boston metropolitan area.\nMajor rail stations include:\nFreight rail.\nCSX is the only class I railroad serving the Boston area, which it reaches by its Boston Subdivision line to Springfield, and by trackage rights over the Northeast Corridor. CSX also has trackage rights over much of the southern half of the MBTA's commuter rail network. In February 2013, CSX moved freight operations from its Beacon Park Yard in Allston to a newly refurbished double stack intermodal yard in Worcester and a new transload facility in Westborough.\nThe other significant freight railroad in the Boston area is Pan Am Railways (PAR; formerly known as the Guilford Rail System). PAR is a class II railroad that operates lines to the north and west of Boston, reaching destinations in New Hampshire, Maine and New York as well as Massachusetts. It also has trackage rights over much of the northern half of the MBTA's commuter rail network. In May 2008, PAR announced a venture with Norfolk Southern Railway to create a jointly owned freight corridor, branded the Patriot Corridor, linking Boston to a newly refurbished intermodal yard in Mechanicville, New York, just north of Albany.\nOnly a few rail freight customers remain in or near Boston, including a chemical packager in Allston, and food distribution facilities and a scrap metal processor in Everett. The Class III Fore River Railroad serves two major customers in Quincy. A plan to ship ethanol by rail to a gasoline mixing plant in Revere was reviewed in 2013. In the face of community opposition and pressure from the state legislature, the company withdrew its proposal on July 2, days before the Lac-M\u00e9gantic derailment.\nWater transportation.\nPort of Boston.\nThe Port of Boston is a major seaport and the largest port in Massachusetts. It was historically important for the growth of the city, and was originally located in what is now the downtown area of the city. Land reclamation and conversion to other uses means that downtown area no longer handles commercial traffic, although the US Coast Guard maintains a major base there, and there is still considerable ferry and leisure usage.\nToday the principal cargo handling facilities are located in the Boston neighborhoods of Charlestown, East Boston, and South Boston, and in the neighbouring city of Everett. In 2011, the port handled over 11.5 million metric tons of cargo, including 192,000 container TEUs. Other major forms of cargo processed at the port include petroleum, liquefied natural gas (LNG), automobiles, cement, gypsum, and salt.\nThe \"Black Falcon Cruise Terminal\" situated in South Boston, was renovated and expanded in 2010. \n During 2012, it served 117 ships and more than 380,000 passengers.\nPassenger boat services.\nThe MBTA ferry system comprises several ferry routes on Boston Harbor. The system has eight routes that terminate in downtown Boston. Year-round routes run to Hingham directly (F1) and via Hull (F2H), and to the Charlestown Navy Yard (F4). Seasonal routes run to East Boston (F3), Lynn (F5), Winthrop (F6), and Quincy (F7); combined Winthrop/Quincy weekend service operates as F8. All services are operated by private sector companies under contract to the MBTA.\nOutside the MBTA system, seasonal passenger ferry services operate to the Boston Harbor Islands, to the city of Salem north of Boston, and to the town of Provincetown on Cape Cod. Water taxis provide on-demand service from various points on the downtown waterfront and from Logan Airport, and in particular between the airport and downtown.\nSeveral companies operate tourist oriented cruise boats on the harbor and on the Charles River. Other companies operate duck tours that use amphibious vehicles (mostly derived from World War II era DUKWs), and encompass both the city's streets and its waterways.\nCommuting statistics.\nThe average amount of time people spend commuting with public transit in Boston, for example to and from work, on a weekday is 83 min. 29% of public transit riders ride for more than two hours every day. The average amount of time people wait at a stop or station for public transit is 15 minutes, while 24% of riders wait for over 20 minutes on average every day. The average distance people usually ride in a single trip with public transit is 7\u00a0km, while 12% travel for over 12\u00a0km in a single direction.\nIn 2013, the Boston-Cambridge-Newton metropolitan statistical area (Boston MSA) had the seventh-lowest percentage of workers who commuted by private automobile (75.6 percent), with 6.2 percent of area workers traveling via rail transit. During the period starting in 2006 and ending in 2013, the Boston MSA had the greatest percentage decline of workers commuting by automobile (3.3 percent) among MSAs with more than a half-million residents.\nIn 2019, a yearly ranking of time wasted in traffic listed Boston area drivers lost approximately 164 hours a year in lost productivity due to the area's traffic congestion. This amounted to $2,300 a year per driver in costs.\nAviation.\nBoston's principal airport is Logan International Airport (BOS), situated in East Boston just across inner Boston Harbor from downtown Boston. Logan Airport is operated by the Massachusetts Port Authority (Massport) and has extensive domestic and international airline service. The airport is linked to downtown by several highway tunnels. The Silver Line bus rapid transit uses these tunnels to connect Logan's terminals with South Station. There are also shuttle buses between the terminals and the Blue Line Airport station.\nTo help address overcrowding at Logan Airport, Massport operates two other airports in eastern Massachusetts:\nIn addition, MassPort has designated two out of state regional airports (which are administered independently) as reliever airports:\nThere are also several general aviation facilities for private planes in the Boston area, including Beverly Regional Airport and Lawrence Municipal Airport to the north, Hanscom Field to the west, and Norwood Memorial Airport to the south. \nSince the September 11, 2001 attacks, strict security has been implemented at all of Boston's airports. Because of this and its location as the closest American port to Europe, Boston is an emergency destination for airliners that experience security or mechanical problems while en route to the US, although they may also be diverted to Halifax, Nova Scotia, or other Canadian airports.\nBoston Vision Zero Plan.\nIn 2015, mayor Marty Walsh announced that the city of Boston would become part of a worldwide program known as Vision Zero. Vision Zero is a plan self described as \u201ca new standard for safety on our streets.\u201d The plan aims to eliminate deaths caused by transportation, whether that be pedestrians, personal vehicle riders, or cyclists.\nSince 2015, the city of Boston has adopted several different policies aimed to help bring down the number of fatalities caused by Transportation in Boston. These policies include the creation of a 25-mile per hour speed limit law citywide, and the implementation of Neighborhood Slow Streets, a tool of Traffic calming designed to make personal vehicles slow down in residential areas. Pedestrian deaths have fallen to 57 in 2019, down from the 2017 total of 82. Cyclist deaths have also fallen from 10 in 2017 to just 3 in 2019.\nBoston now seeks to expand this plan by committing more funds to the program, as they currently spend roughly five dollars per person annually on the Vision Zero plan, whereas cities like San Francisco spend upwards of seventy five dollars per person annually. Boston aims to eliminate vehicle crash fatalities by 2030, while planning for more Neighborhood Slow Streets, speed humps, and curb extensions to help bring vehicle fatalities down to zero. One area that the Boston Transportation Department specifically wants to focus on are the numerous Boston public schools, stating in their 2017/2018 vision zero report, that \u201cWe will be upgrading school zone flashers throughout the City and focusing on schools as we select locations for future safety improvements.\u201d \nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "38231", "revid": "7903804", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=38231", "title": "Lanford Wilson", "text": "American playwright (1937\u20132011)\nLanford Wilson (April 13, 1937\u00a0\u2013 March 24, 2011) was an American playwright. His work, as described by \"The New York Times\", was \"earthy, realist, greatly admired [and] widely performed\". Wilson helped to advance the off-off-Broadway theater movement with his earliest plays, which were first produced at the Caffe Cino beginning in 1964. He was one of the first playwrights to move from off-off-Broadway to off-Broadway, then Broadway and beyond.\nWilson was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship in Drama &amp; Performance Art in 1972. He received the Pulitzer Prize for Drama in 1980 and was elected in 2001 to the American Theater Hall of Fame. In 2004, Wilson was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Letters and received the PEN/Laura Pels International Foundation for Theater Award as a Master American Dramatist. He was nominated for three Tony Awards and has won a Drama Desk Award and five Obie Awards.\nWilson's 1964 short play \"The Madness of Lady Bright\" was his first major success and led to further works throughout the 1960s that expressed a variety of social and romantic themes. In 1969, he co-founded the Circle Repertory Company with theatre director Marshall W. Mason. He wrote many plays for the Circle Repertory in the 1970s. His 1973 play \"The Hot l Baltimore\" was the company's first major success with both audiences and critics. The off-Broadway production exceeded 1,000 performances.\nHis play \"Fifth of July\" was first produced at Circle Repertory in 1978. He received a Tony Award nomination for its Broadway production, which opened in 1980. A prequel to \"Fifth of July\" called \"Talley's Folly\" (opened 1979 at Circle Repertory) opened on Broadway before \"Fifth of July\" and won Wilson the 1980 Pulitzer Prize for Drama and his first Tony nomination. \"Burn This\" (1987) was another Broadway success. Wilson also wrote the libretti for several operas.\nChildhood and education.\nWilson was born to Ralph Eugene and Violetta Tate Wilson in Lebanon, Missouri. After his parents divorced when he was 5, he moved with his mother to Springfield, Missouri, where they lived until she remarried. When he was 11, his mother married Walt E. Lenhard, a farmer from Ozark, Missouri, and they both moved in with him. He had two half-brothers, John and Jim, and one stepsister, Judy. He attended high school in Ozark and developed a love for film and art. As a child, Wilson enjoyed writing short stories and going to see plays performed at Southwest Missouri State College (now Missouri State University). A production of \"Brigadoon\" had a particularly resounding effect on Wilson, saying that \"after that town came back to life on stage, movies didn't stand a chance\". He developed an interest in acting and performed in his high school plays, including the role of Tom in \"The Glass Menagerie\" by Tennessee Williams.\nAfter graduating from Ozark High School in 1955, Wilson began his collegiate studies at Southwest Missouri State College. In 1956, he moved to San Diego, where his father had relocated after his parents' divorce. He studied art and art history at San Diego State College as well as worked as a riveter at the Ryan Aircraft Plant. His reunion with his father was difficult, but the relationship improved in later years, and Wilson based his play \"Lemon Sky\" on their relationship. Wilson left college and moved to Chicago in 1957, where he worked as a graphic artist for an advertising firm. During this time, Wilson realized that the short stories he had always enjoyed writing would be more effective as plays, and began to study playwriting at the University of Chicago extension program.\nEarly work (1962\u20131968).\nIn 1962, Wilson moved to Greenwich Village in New York City. He worked in odd jobs, such as a temporary typist, a reservations clerk at Americana Hotel, at the complaint desk of a furniture store, and at a dishwashing job where a co-worker incorrectly called him \"Lance\". After that, Wilson's friends all called him by that name. Wilson eventually worked for the subscription office of the New York Shakespeare Festival.\nWilson first encountered the Caffe Cino when he went to see Eug\u00e8ne Ionesco's \"The Lesson\". The experience left him thinking that theatre \"could be both dangerous and funny in that way at the same time\". After the show, Wilson introduced himself to Cino co-founder and producer Joe Cino, a pioneer of the off-off-Broadway movement. Cino encouraged Wilson to submit a play to the Cino. In Cino, Wilson found a mentor who would not only critique his plays, but also stage them.\nWilson's first play to premiere at Cino was \"So Long at the Fair\", in August 1963. His works for Caffe Cino include \"Ludlow Fair\" (originally titled \"Nail Polish and Tampons\"), \"Home Free!\", and \"The Madness of Lady Bright\". He continued working odd jobs to support himself during these early years. \"The Madness of Lady Bright\" premiered at Caffe Cino in May\u00a01964. The play concerns \"Lady\" Bright, who is a forty-year-old \"screaming preening queen\". On a sultry summer day in the 1960s, while in his apartment on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, \"Lady\" Bright slowly loses his mind. It is a complex and comic tragedy of striking originality, and one of Wilson's most notable and finest works. At its heart, the work is a penetrating study of loneliness and isolation. It was one of off-off-Broadway's first significant successes, running for over 200 performances. \"The Madness of Lady Bright\" set a record as the longest-running play at Caffe Cino.\nIn 1965, Wilson began writing plays for Ellen Stewart's La MaMa Experimental Theatre Club in the East Village. His first full-length plays premiered at La MaMa, including \"Balm in Gilead\", which depicted a doomed romance in an urban greasy spoon diner inhabited by junkies, prostitutes and thieves. \"Balm in Gilead\" premiered at La MaMa in 1965, directed by Marshall W. Mason. The play was revived in 1984 by Circle Repertory Company and the Steppenwolf Theatre Company, and directed by John Malkovich. Later in 1965, Wilson wrote and directed \"Miss Williams\" for a benefit performance at La MaMa called \"BbAaNnGg!\".\nIn 1965, Wilson's plays \"Home Free!\" and \"No Trespassing\" were produced for La MaMa Repertory Troupe's first European tour. His play \"This is the Rill Speaking\" was produced alongside Jean-Claude van Itallie's \"War\" and Rochelle Owens' \"Homo\" for La MaMa Repertory Troupe's second European tour, in 1966. His play \"Untitled\" was produced with work by Sam Shepard, Tom Eyen, Leonard Melfi, Paul Foster, and Owens, all directed by Tom O'Horgan, for La MaMa Repertory Troupe's third European tour, in 1967. In addition to writing his own plays at La MaMa, Wilson did set design for work by other playwrights. In 1966, he designed the set for Foster's \"The Madonna in the Orchard\", directed by O'Horgan at La MaMa. He then designed the set for Donald Julian's \"In Praise of Folly\", directed by Mason at La MaMa in 1969.\nWilson's play \"The Sand Castle\" was first produced at La MaMa in 1965, as directed by Mason, and was again directed by Mason at La MaMa in 1967. Wilson participated in the inaugural National Playwrights Conference in 1965 at the Eugene O'Neill Theater Center along with Sam Shepard, Edward Albee, and John Guare. His 1966 play \"The Rimers of Eldritch\" addressed hypocrisy and narrow-mindedness in a small town in the rural Midwest and won the 1966/1967 Drama Desk Vernon Rice Award for contribution to off-Broadway theatre. It was first produced at La MaMa in 1966, under Wilson's direction. Wilson directed a revival of \"The Rimers of Eldritch\" at La MaMa in 1981 in celebration of the theater's 20-year anniversary.\n\"The Rimers of Eldritch\" was followed by \"The Gingham Dog\" (1968) about the breakup of an interracial couple. He returned to the O'Neill Theater Center to develop \"Lemon Sky\" in 1968. Wilson described \"Lemon Sky\" (1968) as \"directly autobiographical\". The play's narrator Alan, Wilson's representation of himself, describes his attempt to reconcile with his long-absent father. They fail to meet each other's expectations, and Alan leaves disillusioned by his father's authoritarianism and narrow-mindedness.\nCircle Repertory Company and later work (1969\u20132011).\nIn 1969, Wilson co-founded the Circle Repertory Company with Marshall W. Mason, Tanya Berezin, and Rob Thirkield. Many of Wilson's plays were first produced at the Circle Repertory and directed by Mason. Also in 1969, Wilson was hired for $5,000 to adapt Tennessee Williams' short story \"One Arm\", about a male hustler, into a screenplay. The day after he finished the screenplay, he was invited to a preview of \"Midnight Cowboy\", and after seeing the film thought \"there went that idea down the drain\".\nHis first plays at Circle Repertory, \"The Great Nebula in Orion\", \"Ikke, Ikke, Nye, Nye, Nye\", and \"The Family Continues\", premiered in 1972. \"The Hot l Baltimore\", about lowlifes who face eviction when the decaying hotel in which they live is to be demolished, opened in 1973 and was Circle Repertory's first commercial success. The play also won the New York Drama Critics' Circle Award and an Obie Award. It then transferred off-Broadway to the Circle in the Square Theatre and ran for 1,166\u00a0performances. \"The Hot l Baltimore\" was adapted into a short-lived television series by ABC in 1975, which Wilson pronounced \"a disaster\".\nIn 1974, Wilson acted in Circle Repertory's production of E. E. Cummings' \"Him\" under the direction of Marshal Oglesby. In 1975, Wilson's \"The Mound Builders\", which \"The New York Times\" described as Wilson's \"most ambitious work\", premiered at Circle Rep. The play concerned an ill-fated archeological dig in the Midwest, and, thematically, contemplated the futility of man's achievements. Circle Repertory then produced Wilson's \"Serenading Louie\" in 1976. The play had been unsuccessfully performed in 1970 by the Washington Theater Club, and Wilson revised it for Circle Repertory's production, which is generally regarded as its official premiere.\nSexual identity is among the themes that Wilson explored in his plays. The theme appears in \"The Madness of Lady Bright\", \"Lemon Sky\", \"Fifth of July\", and \"Burn This\". In \"Fifth of July\", a Broadway hit in 1980\u20131982, members of the Talley family decide whether to sell the family farmhouse in Missouri. The story centers on Ken Talley, a disabled Vietnam veteran, and his lover Jed, who are living in the house. Wilson was nominated for the Tony Award for Best Play for \"Fifth of July\". After \"Fifth of July\", Wilson wrote \"Talley's Folly\" (1979), a two-person play depicting the Midwesterner Sally Talley and Jewish Matt Friedman falling in love and become engaged despite the objections of Sally's narrow-minded family. \"Talley &amp; Son\" premiered as \"A Tale Told\" in 1981 but was rewritten and renamed when it opened in 1985. Both are prequels set 30 years prior to \"Fifth of July\". \"Talley's Folly\" was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for Drama in 1980 and received a nomination for the Tony Award for Best Play. Around this time, Norman Mailer asked Wilson to adapt \"The Executioner's Song\" for a television movie, but Wilson declined.\n\"Angels Fall\" opened on Broadway in 1983, earning Wilson his third nomination for the Tony Award for Best Play. \"The New York Times\" review said, \"Mr.\u00a0Wilson is one of the few artists in our theater who can truly make America sing.\" In \"Burn This\", a young gay dancer named Robbie and his lover Dom have died in a boating accident before the play begins. Robbie's roommates, his dance partner Anna and the gay, confident Larry, must come to terms with Robbie's death. Anna learns to be independent and self-confident, pursuing her interest in choreography, beginning a relationship with Robbie's grieving brother Pale, and ending her dispassionate relationship with her longtime boyfriend.\nIn addition to writing plays, Wilson wrote the libretti for several operas. He collaborated with composer Lee Hoiby for \"Summer and Smoke\" (1971) and adapted his own play, \"This is the Rill Speaking\", in 1992. \"Summer and Smoke\" is an adaptation of Tennessee Williams' play of the same name. Williams gave Hoiby permission to compose an opera based on the play, and Hoiby asked Wilson to adapt the play into a libretto. \"This is the Rill Speaking\" is a one-act chamber opera that Wilson adapted from his own play of the same name. In 1984, Wilson wrote a new translation of Anton Chekhov's \"Three Sisters\" for the Hartford Stage Company. Wilson attempted to make his translation sound like everyday speech, as he believed that existing translations were linguistically accurate but not inherently theatrical. Reviews of the Hartford production and a subsequent production by the Steppenwolf Theater Company praised Wilson's idiomatic dialogue.\nHe also became active with the Bay Street Theatre in Sag Harbor, where some of his new short plays were produced, including the 1996 world premiere of his comedy \"Virgil Is Still the Frogboy\", commissioned by the Bay Street Theatre and underwritten by \"Vanity Fair\" magazine. The title refers to a famous graffiti spray-painted on a railroad bridge that had puzzled people in the Hamptons for years. Directed by Marshall W. Mason, the production starred Arija Bareiikis, Bobby Cannavale, Jennifer Dundas, Thomas McCarthy, and Josh Pais, running from August\u00a014 to September\u00a09, 1996.\nPersonal life and death.\nWilson was openly gay. After moving to New York City in 1962, he settled in an apartment on Sheridan Square in Greenwich Village, where he lived for many years. In the 1970s, he bought a house in Sag Harbor, Long Island. He lived in both places, using his Manhattan apartment primarily when he had a play in production there. When living in Manhattan, he worked with Playwrights Laboratory at the Circle Repertory Company, often attending readings, rehearsals, and productions.\nAround 1998, Wilson gave up his apartment in New York to live full-time in Sag Harbor.\nWilson died on March 24, 2011, aged 73, from complications of pneumonia.\nAwards, recognition, and legacy.\nIn 1995, he received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement.\nIn 2004, Wilson received the PEN/Laura Pels International Foundation for Theater Award for a Master American Dramatist. Also in 2004, he was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Letters.\nIn 2009, he shared insights about his friendship with Tennessee Williams at a theatre festival in Provincetown, Massachusetts.\nIn 2010, Debra Monk presented Wilson with the Artistic Achievement Award from the New York Innovative Theatre Awards. This honor was awarded by the off-off-Broadway community \"in recognition of his brave and unique works that helped establish the off-off-Broadway community and propel the independent theatre voice as an important contributor to the American stage.\"\nBen Brantley, theatre critic for \"The New York Times\", has said that Wilson's plays reflect \"disenchantment with the state of the nation...A couple plays, at least, featured embittered Vietnam veterans. At the same time, he harked back to the era of more sentimental plays \u2013 of portraits of losers on the margins of life.\" Wilson and Marshall W. Mason encouraged method acting and often used Constantin Stanislavski's technique. In addition to John Malkovich, Judd Hirsch, Swoosie Kurtz, William Hurt, Jeff Daniels, David Morse, and Christopher Reeve were among the actors who starred in Wilson and Mason's productions.\nSelected works.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-begin/styles.css\"/&gt;\nCesear's Forum, Cleveland's minimalist theatre company, presented \"Lanford Wilson: Take 5\", at Kennedy's Down Under, Playhouse Square in a September/October 2016 production.

Historically, his biography, including the dates he lived, is obscure beyond the poetry, which suggests he lived between 1245 and 1265.\nHis name becomes associated with a \"fairy queen\"\u2013type folk ballad in German folklore of the 16th century.\nHistorical Tannh\u00e4user.\nThe most common tradition has him as a descendant of the \"Tanhusen\" family of Imperial \"ministeriales\", documented in various 13th century sources, with their residence in the area of Neumarkt in the Bavarian Nordgau. These sources identify him as being descended of an Old Styrian noble family.\nThe illustrated \"Codex Manesse\" manuscript (about 1300\u20131340) depicts him clad in the Teutonic Order habit, suggesting he might have fought in the Sixth Crusade led by Emperor Frederick II in 1228/29. \nFor a while, Tannh\u00e4user was an active courtier at the court of the Austrian duke Frederick the Warlike, who ruled from 1230 to 1246. Frederick was the last of the Babenberg dukes; upon his death in the Battle of the Leitha River, Tannh\u00e4user left the Vienna court.\nTannh\u00e4user was a proponent of the \"leich\" (\"lai\") style of minnesang and dance-song poetry. As literature, his poems parody the traditional genre with irony and hyperbole, somewhat similar to later commercium songs. However, his \"Bu\u00dflied\" (Poem on Atonement) is unusual, given the eroticism of the remaining \"Codex Manesse\".\nTannh\u00e4user legend.\nBased on his \"Bu\u00dflied\", Tannh\u00e4user became the subject of a legendary account. It makes Tannh\u00e4user a knight and poet who found the Venusberg, the subterranean home of Venus, and spent a year there worshipping the goddess. After leaving the Venusberg, Tannh\u00e4user is filled with remorse, and travels to Rome to ask Pope Urban IV (reigned 1261\u20131264) if it is possible to be absolved of his sins. Urban replies that forgiveness is impossible, as much as it would be for his papal staff to blossom. Three days after Tannh\u00e4user's departure, Urban's staff blooms with flowers; messengers are sent to retrieve the knight, but he has already returned to Venusberg, never to be seen again.\nThe earliest version of the narrative of the legend, not yet associated with the name of Tannh\u00e4user, is first recorded by the Proven\u00e7al writer Antoine de la Sale (c. 1440) in his book \"La Salade\". Here he narrates his visit to the town of Montemonaco in the Sibillini Mountains, Italy, and reports on the local legend of a fairy court hidden in a cave on the local mountains. La Sale personally visited the cave but did not delve into it past the entrance. He also reports the legend of an unnamed German knight who would have descended in the cave and lived there as one of the fairies' spouse, before coming back to seek forgiveness from the Pope. Despairing of not being forgiven for his sins, he would have returned to the fairies' cave to live eternally among them.\nThe association of this narrative with the name of Tannh\u00e4user appears to take place in the early 16th century. A German \"Tannh\u00e4user\" folk ballad is recorded in numerous versions beginning around 1510.\nThe popularity of the ballad continued unabated well into the 17th century. \nThe motif became most popular as the principal source for Richard Wagner's large three-act opera \"Tannh\u00e4user\" (1845), which changes a few story elements and is known for including a scandalous depiction of the revels of Venus's court in its first scene. The plot of the opera covers both the \"Tannh\u00e4user\" legend and the epic of the \"S\u00e4ngerkrieg\" at Wartburg Castle.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

She principally wrote fantasy and speculative fiction novels for children and young adults. Although usually described as fantasy, some of her work also incorporates science fiction themes and elements of realism. Jones's work often explores themes of time travel and parallel or multiple universes. Some of her better-known works are the \"Chrestomanci\" series, the \"Dalemark\" series, the three \"Moving Castle\" novels, \"Dark Lord of Derkholm\", and \"The Tough Guide to Fantasyland\".\nJones has been cited as an inspiration and muse for several fantasy and science fiction authors including Philip Pullman, Terry Pratchett, Penelope Lively, Robin McKinley, Dina Rabinovitch, Megan Whalen Turner, J.K. Rowling and Neil Gaiman, with Gaiman describing her as \"quite simply the best writer for children of her generation\". Her work has been nominated for several awards. She was twice a finalist for the Hugo Award, nominated fourteen times for the Locus Award, seven times for the Mythopoeic Award (which she won twice), twice for a British Fantasy Award (won in 1999), and twice for a World Fantasy Award, which she won in 2007.\nEarly life and marriage.\nJones was born in London, the daughter of Marjorie (n\u00e9e Jackson) and Richard Aneurin Jones, both of whom were teachers. When war was announced, shortly after her fifth birthday, she was evacuated to Pontarddulais in Wales where her grandfather was a minister at a chapel. She did not live long in Wales due to a family dispute, and thereafter moved several times, including periods in the Lake District, in York, and back to London. In 1943 her family finally settled in Thaxted, Essex, where her parents worked running an educational conference centre. There, Jones and her two younger sisters Isobel (later Professor Isobel Armstrong, the literary critic) and Ursula (later an actress and a children's writer) spent a childhood left chiefly to their own devices.\nAfter attending Friends' School, Saffron Walden, she studied English at St Anne's College, Oxford, where she attended lectures by both C. S. Lewis and J. R. R. Tolkien before graduating in 1956. In the same year she married John Burrow, a prominent scholar of medieval literature, with whom she had three sons, Richard, Michael and Colin. After a brief period in London, in 1957 the couple returned to Oxford, where they stayed until moving to Bristol in 1976.\nCareer.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n\"He spread his arms and language rolled from him, sonorous, magnificent, and rhythmic.. for years after that, I used to dream regularly that a piece of my bedroom wall slid aside revealing my grandfather declaiming in Welsh, and I knew he was declaiming about my sins.

I listen to it like music when I write.\"\n\"- An excerpt from her autobiography detailing her time at Wales with her grandfather.\"\nDiana Wynne Jones, Reflections on the magic of writing \u2013 Random House, 2012.\nJones started writing during the mid-1960s \"mostly to keep [her] sanity\", when the youngest of her three children was about two years old and the family lived in a house owned by an Oxford college. Besides the children, she felt harried by the crises of adults in the household: a sick husband, a mother-in-law, a sister, and a friend with daughter. Her first book was a novel for adults published by Macmillan in 1970, entitled \"Changeover\". It originated as the British Empire was divesting colonies; she recalled in 2004 that it had \"seemed like every month, we would hear that yet another small island or tiny country had been granted independence.\" \"Changeover\" is set in a fictional African colony during transition, and what begins as a memo about the problem of how to \"mark changeover\" ceremonially is misunderstood to be about the threat of a terrorist named Mark Changeover. It is a farce with a large cast of characters, featuring government, police, and army bureaucracies; sex, politics, and news. In 1965, when Rhodesia declared independence unilaterally (one of the last colonies and not tiny), \"I felt as if the book were coming true as I wrote it.\"\nThe \"Harry Potter\" books are frequently compared to the works of Diana Wynne Jones. Many of her earlier children's books were out of print in recent years, but have now been re-issued for the young audience whose interest in fantasy and reading was spurred by \"Harry Potter\".\nJones's works are also compared to those of Robin McKinley and Neil Gaiman. She was friends with both McKinley and Gaiman, and Jones and Gaiman were fans of each other's work; she dedicated her 1993 novel \"Hexwood\" to him after something he said in conversation inspired a key part of the plot. Gaiman had already dedicated his 1991 four-part comic book mini-series \"The Books of Magic\" to \"four witches\", of whom Jones was one.\nFor \"Charmed Life\", the first Chrestomanci novel, Jones won the 1978 Guardian Children's Fiction Prize, a once-in-a-lifetime award by \"The Guardian\" newspaper that is judged by a panel of children's writers. Three times she was a commended runner-up for the Carnegie Medal from the Library Association, recognising the year's best children's book: for \"Dogsbody\" (1975), \"Charmed Life\" (1977), and the fourth Chrestomanci book \"The Lives of Christopher Chant\" (1988). She won the Mythopoeic Fantasy Award, children's section, in 1996 for \"The Crown of Dalemark\" (concluding that series) and in 1999 for \"Dark Lord of Derkholm\"; in four other years she was a finalist for the annual literary award by the Mythopoeic Society.\nThe 1986 novel \"Howl's Moving Castle\" was inspired by a boy at a school she was visiting, who asked her to write a book called The Moving Castle. It was published first by Greenwillow in the U.S., where it was a runner-up for the annual Boston Globe\u2013Horn Book Award in children's fiction. In 2004, Hayao Miyazaki made the Japanese-language animated movie \"Howl's Moving Castle\", which was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature. A version dubbed in English was released in the UK and US in 2005, with the voice of Howl performed by Christian Bale. Next year Jones and the novel won the annual Phoenix Award from the Children's Literature Association, recognising the best children's book published twenty years earlier that did not win a major award (named for mythical bird phoenix to suggest the book's rise from obscurity).\n\"Fire and Hemlock\" had been the 2005 Phoenix runner-up. It is a novel based on Scottish ballads, and was a Mythopoeic Fantasy finalist in its own time.\n\"Archer's Goon\" (1984) was a runner-up for that year's Horn Book Award. It was adapted for television in 1992. One Jones fansite believes it to be \"the only tv adaptation (so far) of one of Diana's books\".\nJones's book on clich\u00e9s in fantasy fiction, \"The Tough Guide To Fantasyland\" (nonfiction), has a cult following among writers and critics, despite initially being difficult to find due to an erratic printing history. It was reissued in the UK, and has been reissued in the United States in 2006 by Firebird Books. The Firebird edition has additional material and a completely new design, including a new map.\nThe British Fantasy Society recognised her significant impact on fantasy with its Karl Edward Wagner Award in 1999. She received an honorary D.Litt from the University of Bristol in July 2006 and the World Fantasy Award for Life Achievement in 2007.\nIn August 2014, Google commemorated Jones with a Google Doodle created by Google artist Sophie Diao.\nIllness and death.\nJones was diagnosed with lung cancer in the early summer of 2009. She underwent surgery in July and reported to friends that the procedure had been successful. However, in June 2010 she announced that she would be discontinuing chemotherapy because it only made her feel ill. She died on 26 March 2011 from the disease.\nThe story in progress when she became too ill to write, \"The Islands of Chaldea\", was completed by her sister Ursula Jones in 2014. Interviewed by \"The Guardian\" in June 2013 after she finished the Chaldea story, Ursula Jones said that \"other things were coming to light\u00a0...

{"id": "38235", "revid": "8690395", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=38235", "title": "Parsifal", "text": "Music drama by Richard Wagner\nParsifal (WWV 111) is a music drama in three acts by the German composer Richard Wagner and his last composition. Wagner's own libretto for the work is freely based on the 13th-century Middle High German chivalric romance \"Parzival\" of the \"Minnes\u00e4nger\" Wolfram von Eschenbach and the Old French chivalric romance \"Perceval ou le Conte du Graal\" by the 12th-century \"trouv\u00e8re\" Chr\u00e9tien de Troyes, recounting different accounts of the story of the Arthurian knight Parzival (Percival) and his spiritual quest for the Holy Grail.\nWagner conceived the work in April 1857, but did not finish it until 25 years later. In composing it he took advantage of the particular acoustics of his newly built Bayreuth Festspielhaus. \"Parsifal\" was first produced at the second Bayreuth Festival in 1882. The Bayreuth Festival maintained a monopoly on \"Parsifal\" productions until 1914, however the opera was performed at the Metropolitan Opera in New York in 1903 after a US court ruled that it was legal.\nWagner described \"Parsifal\" not as an opera, but as (a sacred festival stage play). At Bayreuth a tradition has arisen that audiences do not applaud at the end of the first act. The autograph manuscript of the work is preserved in the Richard Wagner Foundation.\nComposition.\nWagner read von Eschenbach's poem \"Parzival\" while taking the waters at Marienbad in 1845. After encountering Arthur Schopenhauer's writings in 1854, Wagner became interested in Indian philosophies, especially Buddhism. Out of this interest came \"Die Sieger\" (\"The Victors\", 1856), a sketch Wagner wrote for an opera based on a story from the life of Buddha. The themes of self-renunciation, rebirth, compassion, and even exclusive social groups (castes in , the knights of the Grail in Parsifal) which were later explored in \"Parsifal\" were first introduced in .\nAccording to his autobiography , Wagner conceived \"Parsifal\" on Good Friday morning, April 1857, in the (German: \"Asylum\"), the small cottage on Otto Wesendonck's estate in the Z\u00fcrich suburb of Enge, which Wesendonck \u2013 a wealthy silk merchant and generous patron of the arts \u2013 had placed at Wagner's disposal, through the good offices of his wife Mathilde Wesendonck. The composer and his wife Minna had moved into the cottage on 28April:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;... on Good Friday I awoke to find the sun shining brightly for the first time in this house: the little garden was radiant with green, the birds sang, and at last I could sit on the roof and enjoy the long-yearned-for peace with its message of promise. Full of this sentiment, I suddenly remembered that the day was Good Friday, and I called to mind the significance this omen had already once assumed for me when I was reading Wolfram's \"Parzival\". Since the sojourn in Marienbad [in the summer of 1845], where I had conceived and \"Lohengrin\", I had never occupied myself again with that poem; now its noble possibilities struck me with overwhelming force, and out of my thoughts about Good Friday I rapidly conceived a whole drama, of which I made a rough sketch with a few dashes of the pen, dividing the whole into three acts.\nHowever, as his second wife Cosima Wagner later reported on 22 April 1879, this account had been colored by a certain amount of poetic licence:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;R[ichard] today recalled the impression which inspired his \"Good Friday Music\"; he laughs, saying he had thought to himself, \"In fact it is all as far-fetched as my love affairs, for it was not a Good Friday at all \u2013 just a pleasant mood in Nature which made me think, 'This is how a Good Friday ought to be'\".\nThe work may indeed have been conceived at Wesendonck's cottage in the last week of April 1857, but Good Friday that year fell on 10 April, when the Wagners were still living at Zeltweg 13 in Z\u00fcrich. If the prose sketch which Wagner mentions in was accurately dated (and most of Wagner's surviving papers are dated), it could settle the issue once and for all, but unfortunately it has not survived.\nWagner did not resume work on \"Parsifal\" for eight years, during which time he completed \"Tristan und Isolde\" and began \"Die Meistersinger von N\u00fcrnberg\". Then, between 27 and 30 August 1865, he took up \"Parsifal\" again and made a prose draft of the work; this contains a fairly brief outline of the plot and a considerable amount of detailed commentary on the characters and themes of the drama. But once again the work was dropped and set aside for another eleven and a half years. During this time most of Wagner's creative energy was devoted to the \"Ring\" cycle, which was finally completed in 1874 and given its first full performance at Bayreuth in August 1876. Only when this gargantuan task had been accomplished did Wagner find the time to concentrate on \"Parsifal\". By 23 February 1877 he had completed a second and more extensive prose draft of the work, and by 19 April of the same year he had transformed this into a verse libretto (or \"poem\", as Wagner liked to call his libretti).\nIn September 1877 he began the music by making two complete drafts of the score from beginning to end. The first of these (known in German as the and in English as either the \"preliminary draft\" or the \"first complete draft\") was made in pencil on three staves, one for the voices and two for the instruments. The second complete draft (, \"orchestral draft\", \"short score\" or \"particell\") was made in ink and on at least three, but sometimes as many as five, staves. This draft was much more detailed than the first and contained a considerable degree of instrumental elaboration.\nThe second draft was begun on 25 September 1877, just a few days after the first; at this point in his career Wagner liked to work on both drafts simultaneously, switching back and forth between the two so as not to allow too much time to elapse between his initial setting of the text and the final elaboration of the music. The of act 3 was completed on 16 April 1879 and the on the 26th of the same month.\nThe full score () was the final stage in the compositional process. It was made in ink and consisted of a fair copy of the entire opera, with all the voices and instruments properly notated according to standard practice. Wagner composed \"Parsifal\" one act at a time, completing the and of each act before beginning the \"Gesamtentwurf\" of the next act; but because the already embodied all the compositional details of the full score, the actual drafting of the was regarded by Wagner as little more than a routine task which could be done whenever he found the time. The prelude of act 1 was scored in August 1878. The rest of the opera was scored between August 1879 and 13 January 1882.\nPerformance history.\nPremiere.\nOn 12 November 1880, Wagner conducted a private performance of the prelude for his patron Ludwig II of Bavaria at the Court Theatre in Munich. The premiere of the entire work was given in the Bayreuth Festspielhaus on 26 July 1882 conducted by the Jewish-German conductor Hermann Levi. Stage designs were by Max Br\u00fcckner and Paul von Joukowsky, who took their lead from Wagner himself. The Grail hall was based on the interior of Siena Cathedral which Wagner had visited in 1880, while Klingsor's magic garden was modelled on those at the Palazzo Rufolo in Ravello. In July and August 1882 sixteen performances of the work were given in Bayreuth conducted by Levi and Franz Fischer. The production boasted an orchestra of 107, a chorus of 135 and 23 soloists (with the main parts being double cast). At the last of these performances, Wagner took the baton from Levi and conducted the final scene of act 3 from the orchestral interlude to the end.\nAt the first performances of \"Parsifal\", problems with the moving scenery (the ) during the transition from scene 1 to scene 2 in act 1 meant that Wagner's existing orchestral interlude finished before Parsifal and Gurnemanz arrived at the hall of the Grail. Engelbert Humperdinck, who was assisting the production, provided a few extra bars of music to cover this gap. In subsequent years this problem was solved and Humperdinck's additions were not used.\nBan outside Bayreuth.\nFor the first twenty years of its existence, the only staged performances of \"Parsifal\" took place in the Bayreuth Festspielhaus, the venue for which Wagner conceived the work (except eight private performances for Ludwig II at Munich in 1884 and 1885). Wagner had two reasons for wanting to keep \"Parsifal\" exclusively for the Bayreuth stage. First, he wanted to prevent it from degenerating into 'mere amusement' for an opera-going public. Only at Bayreuth could his last work be presented in the way envisaged by him\u2014a tradition maintained by his wife, Cosima, long after his death. Second, he thought that the opera would provide an income for his family after his death if Bayreuth had the monopoly on its performance.\nThe Bayreuth authorities allowed unstaged performances to take place in various countries after Wagner's death (London in 1884, New York City in 1886, and Amsterdam in 1894) but they maintained an embargo on stage performances outside Bayreuth. On 24 December 1903, after receiving a court ruling that performances in the United States could not be prevented by Bayreuth, the New York Metropolitan Opera staged the complete opera, using many Bayreuth-trained singers. Cosima barred anyone involved in the New York production from working at Bayreuth in future performances. Unauthorized stage performances were also undertaken in Amsterdam in 1905, 1906 and 1908. There was a performance in Buenos Aires, in the Teatro Coliseo, on June 20, 1913, under Gino Marinuzzi.\nBayreuth lifted its monopoly on \"Parsifal\" on 1 January 1914 in the Teatro Comunale di Bologna in Bologna with Giuseppe Borgatti. Some opera houses began their performances at midnight between 31 December 1913 and 1 January. The first authorized performance was staged at the Gran Teatre del Liceu in Barcelona: it began at 10:30pm Barcelona time, which was an hour behind Bayreuth. Such was the demand for \"Parsifal\" that it was presented in more than 50 European opera houses between 1 January and 1 August 1914.\nApplause.\nAt Bayreuth performances audiences do not applaud at the end of the first act. This tradition is the result of a misunderstanding arising from Wagner's desire at the premiere to maintain the serious mood of the opera. After much applause following the first and second acts, Wagner spoke to the audience and said that the cast would take no curtain calls until the end of the performance. This confused the audience, who remained silent at the end of the opera until Wagner addressed them again, saying that he did not mean that they could not applaud. After the performance Wagner complained, \"Now I don't know. Did the audience like it or not?\" At subsequent performances some believed that Wagner had wanted no applause until the very end, and there was silence after the first two acts. Eventually it became a Bayreuth tradition that no applause would be heard after the first act, but this was certainly not Wagner's idea. In fact, during the first Bayreuth performances, Wagner himself cried \"Bravo!\" as the flowermaidens made their exit in the second act, only to be hissed by other members of the audience. At some theatres other than Bayreuth, applause and curtain calls are normal practice after every act. Program notes until 2013 at the Metropolitan Opera in New York asked the audience not to applaud after act 1.\nPost-war performances.\n\"Parsifal\" is one of the Wagner operas regularly presented at the Bayreuth Festival to this day. Among the more significant post-war productions was that directed in 1951 by Wieland Wagner, the composer's grandson. At the first Bayreuth Festival after World War II he presented a radical move away from literal representation of the hall of the Grail or the flowermaiden's bower. Instead, lighting effects and the bare minimum of scenery were used to complement Wagner's music. This production was heavily influenced by the ideas of the Swiss stage designer Adolphe Appia. The reaction to this production was extreme: Ernest Newman, Richard Wagner's biographer, described it as \"not only the best \"Parsifal\" I have ever seen and heard, but one of the three or four most moving spiritual experiences of my life\". Others were appalled that Wagner's stage directions were being flouted. The conductor of the 1951 production, Hans Knappertsbusch, on being asked how he could conduct such a disgraceful travesty, declared that right up until the dress rehearsal he imagined that the stage decorations were still to come. Knappertsbusch was particularly upset by the omission of the dove that appears over Parsifal's head at the end of the opera, which he claimed inspired him to give better performances. To placate his conductor Wieland arranged to reinstate the dove, which descended on a string. What Knappertsbusch did not realise was that Wieland had made the string long enough for the conductor to see the dove, but not for the audience. Wieland continued to modify and refine his Bayreuth production of Parsifal until his death in 1966. Martha M\u00f6dl created a \"complex, tortured Kundry in Wieland Wagner's revolutionary production of Parsifal during the festival's first postwar season\", and would remain the company's exclusive Kundry for the remainder of the decade.\nSummary.\nAct 1.\nPrelude to act 1\nMusical introduction to the work with a duration of c. 12\u201316 minutes.\n\"Scene 1\"\nIn a forest near the seat of the Grail and its knights, Gurnemanz, an elder knight of the Grail, wakes his young squires and leads them in morning prayer (\"He! Ho! Waldh\u00fcter ihr\"). Their king, Amfortas, has been stabbed by the Holy Spear, once bequeathed to him into his guardianship, and the wound will not heal.\nA woman named Kundry arrives in a frenzy, with soothing balsam from Arabia. The squires eye Kundry with mistrust and question her. They believe Kundry to be an evil pagan witch. Gurnemanz restrains them and defends her. He relates the history of Amfortas and the spear; it was stolen from him by the failed knight Klingsor.\nGurnemanz's squires ask how it is that he knew Klingsor. Gurnemanz tells them that Klingsor was once a respected knight. Unable to cleanse himself of sin, he castrated himself in an effort to attain purity, but instead became an evil monstrosity.\nA boy named Parsifal enters, carrying a swan which he has killed. Shocked, Gurnemanz speaks sternly to the lad, saying that this land is a holy place, not to be defiled by murder. Remorsefully the young man breaks his bow in agitation and casts it aside. Kundry tells him that she has seen that his mother has died. Parsifal, who cannot remember much of his past, is crestfallen.\nGurnemanz wonders if Parsifal might be the predicted \"pure fool\"; he invites Parsifal to witness the Ceremony of the Uncovering of the Grail, which renews the knights' immortality.\nOrchestral interlude \u2013 \"Verwandlungsmusik\" (\"Transformation music\")\n\"Scene 2\"\nThe voice of the retired king Titurel resounds from a vaulted crypt in the background, demanding that his son Amfortas uncover the Grail and serve his kingly office (\"Mein Sohn Amfortas, bist du am Amt?\"). Only through the immortality-conferring power of the sacred chalice and the Saviour's blood contained therein may Titurel himself, now aged and very feeble, live on. Amfortas is overcome with shame and suffering (\"Wehvolles Erbe, dem ich verfallen\"). He, the chosen guardian of the holiest of relics, has succumbed to sin and lost the Holy Spear, suffering an ever-bleeding wound in the process; uncovering the Grail causes him great pain. The young man appears to suffer with him, clutching convulsively at his heart. The knights and Titurel urge Amfortas to reveal the Grail (\"Enth\u00fcllet den Gral!\"), and he finally does. The dark hall is illuminated by its radiant light and the round table of the knights is miraculously filled with wine and bread. Slowly all the knights and squires disappear, leaving Gurnemanz and the youth alone. Gurnemanz asks the youth if he has understood what he has seen. As the boy is unable to answer the question, Gurnemanz dismisses him as just an ordinary fool after all and angrily exiles him from the realm with a warning to let the swans in the Grail Kingdom live in peace.\nAct 2.\nPrelude to act 2 \u2013 \"Klingsors Zauberschloss\" (\"Klingsor's Magic Castle\")\nMusical introduction of c. 2\u20133 minutes.\n\"Scene 1\"\nKlingsor's castle and enchanted garden. Waking her from her sleep, Klingsor conjures up Kundry, now transformed into an incredibly alluring woman. He calls her by many names: First Sorceress (), Hell's Rose (), Herodias, Gundryggia and, lastly, Kundry. She mocks his self-castrated condition but cannot resist his power. He resolves to send her to seduce Parsifal and ruin him as she ruined Amfortas before.\n\"Scene 2\"\nThe youth walks into a wondrous garden, surrounded by beautiful and seductive flowermaidens. They call to him and entwine themselves about him while chiding him for wounding their lovers (), yet the boy in his childlike innocent na\u00efvet\u00e9 doesn't comprehend their temptations and shows only little interest in them. The flowermaidens soon fight and bicker among themselves to win his devotion, to the point that he is about to flee, but a different voice suddenly calls out \"Parsifal!\". The youth finally recalls this name is what his mother called him when she appeared in his dreams. The flowermaidens back away from him and call him a fool as they leave him and Kundry alone.\nParsifal wonders if the whole Garden is but a dream and asks how it is that Kundry knows his name. Kundry tells him she learned it from his mother (), who had loved him and tried to shield him from his father's fate, the mother he had abandoned and who had finally died of grief. She reveals many parts of Parsifal's history to him and he is stricken with remorse, blaming himself for his mother's death. Kundry tells him that this realization is a first sign of understanding and that, with a kiss, she can help him understand the love that had once united his parents, wanting thus to awake in Parsifal the first pangs of desire. However, as she kisses Parsifal, the youth suddenly recoils in pain and cries out Amfortas' name: having just felt for the first time material desire with Kundry's kiss, Parsifal finds himself in the same position in which Amfortas had been seduced and he feels the wounded king's pain and suffering of evil and sin burning in his own soul. Only now does Parsifal understand Amfortas' passion during the Grail Ceremony ().\nFurious that her ploy has failed, Kundry tells Parsifal that if he can feel compassion for Amfortas, then he should also be able to feel it for her. In a distant past, she saw the Redeemer and mockingly laughed at His pains in malice. As a punishment for this sin she has been cursed and bound by Klingsor and has fallen under his yoke. The curse condemns her to never be able to die and find peace and redemption. She cannot weep, only jeer diabolically. Longing for deliverance, she has been waiting for ages for a man to free her from her curse and yearns to once more meet the Saviour's forgiving gaze, but her search for her redeemer in the end only ever turns into a desire to find her salvation in earthly desire with those who fall for her charms. All her penitent endeavours eventually transform into a renewed life of sin and a continued unredeemed existence in bondage to Klingsor. When Parsifal still resists her, Kundry curses him through the power of her own accursed being to wander without ever finding the Kingdom of the Grail again, and finally calls on her master Klingsor to help her.\nKlingsor appears on the castle rampart and hurls the Holy Spear at Parsifal to destroy him. Parsifal seizes the spear in his hand and makes with it the sign of the Cross, banishing Klingsor's dark sorcery. The whole castle with Klingsor himself suddenly sinks as if by terrible earthquake and the enchanted garden withers. As Parsifal leaves, he tells Kundry that she knows where she can find him.\nAct 3.\nPrelude to act 3 \u2013 \"Parsifals Irrfahrt\" (\"Parsifal's Wandering\")\nMusical introduction of c. 4\u20136 minutes.\n\"Scene 1\"\nThe scene takes place many years later. Gurnemanz is now aged and bent, living alone as a hermit. It is Good Friday. He hears moaning near his hut and finds Kundry lying unconscious in the brush, just as he had many years before (\"Sie! Wieder da!\"). He revives her using water from the Holy Spring, but she will only speak the word \"serve\" (\"Dienen\"). Looking into the forest, Gurnemanz sees a figure approaching, armed and in full armour. The stranger removes his helmet and Gurnemanz recognizes the lad who shot the swan; to his amazement the knight also bears the Holy Spear.\nKundry washes Parsifal's feet and Gurnemanz anoints him with water from the Holy Spring, recognizing him as the pure fool, now enlightened by compassion and freed from guilt through purifying suffering, and proclaims him the foretold new king of the knights of the Grail.\nParsifal looks about and comments on the beauty of the meadow. Gurnemanz explains that today is Good Friday, when all the world is purified and renewed.\nA dark orchestral interlude leads into the solemn gathering of the knights.\nOrchestral interlude \u2013 \"Verwandlungsmusik\" (\"Transformation music\") \u2013 \"Titurels Totenfeier\" (\"Titurel's Funeral March\")\n\"Scene 2\"\nWithin the Castle of the Grail, Titurel's funeral is to take place. Mourning processions of knights bring the deceased Titurel in a coffin and the Grail in its shrine, as well as Amfortas on his litter, to the Grail hall (). The knights desperately urge Amfortas to keep his promise and at least once more, for the very last time uncover the Grail again, but Amfortas, in a frenzy, says he will never again show the Grail, as doing so would just prolong his unbearable torment. Instead, he commands the knights to kill him and end with his suffering also the shame he has brought on the brotherhood. At this moment, Parsifal appears and declares only one weapon can help here: only the same spear that inflicted the wound can now close it (). He touches Amfortas' side with the Holy Spear and both heals the wound and absolves him from sin. The spear, now reunited with the Holy Grail, starts to bleed with the same divine blood that is contained within the sacred chalice. Extolling the virtue of compassion and blessing Amfortas' suffering for making a pure fool knowing, Parsifal replaces Amfortas in his kingly office and orders to unveil the Grail, which is never to be hidden again. As the Grail glows ever brighter with light and a white dove descends from the top of the dome and hovers over Parsifal's head, a \"chorus mysticus\" of all the knights praises the miracle of salvation () and proclaims the redemption of the Redeemer (). Kundry, also at the very last released from her curse and redeemed, slowly sinks lifeless to the ground with her gaze resting on Parsifal, who raises the Grail in blessing over the worshipping knighthood.\nReactions.\nSince \"Parsifal\" could initially only be seen at the Bayreuth Festival, the first presentation in 1882 was attended by many notable figures. Reaction was varied. Some thought that \"Parsifal\" marked a weakening of Wagner's abilities, many others saw the work as a crowning achievement. The famous critic and Wagner's theoretical opponent Eduard Hanslick gave his opinion that \"The Third act may be counted the most unified and the most atmospheric. It is not the richest musically,\" going on to note: \"And Wagner's creative powers? For a man of his age and his method they are astounding\". But \"It would be foolishness to declare that Wagner's fantasy, and specifically his musical invention, has retained the freshness and facility of yore. One cannot help but discern sterility and prosaicism, together with increasing longwindedness.\"\nThe conductor Felix Weingartner found that: \"The flowermaidens' costumes showed extraordinary lack of taste, but the singing was incomparable\u2026 When the curtain had been rung down on the final scene and we were walking down the hill, I seemed to hear the words of Goethe 'and you can say you were present'. The \"Parsifal\" performances of 1882 were artistic events of supreme interest and it is my pride and joy that I participated in them.\" Many contemporary composers shared Weingartner's opinion. Hugo Wolf was a student at the time of the 1882 Festival, yet still managed to find money for tickets to see \"Parsifal\" twice. He emerged overwhelmed: \"Colossal \u2013 Wagner's most inspired, sublimest creation.\" He reiterated this view in a postcard from Bayreuth in 1883: \"\"Parsifal\" is without doubt by far the most beautiful and sublime work in the whole field of Art.\"\nGustav Mahler was also present in 1883 and he wrote to a friend: \"I can hardly describe my present state to you. When I came out of the Festspielhaus, completely spellbound, I understood that the greatest and most painful revelation had just been made to me, and that I would carry it unspoiled for the rest of my life.\" Max Reger, in a later account, simply noted that \"When I first heard \"Parsifal\" at Bayreuth I was fifteen. I cried for two weeks and then became a musician.\" That was in 1888. Jean Sibelius, visiting the Festival in 1894, said: \"Nothing in the world has made so overwhelming an impression on me. All my innermost heart-strings throbbed\u2026 I cannot begin to tell you how \"Parsifal\" has transported me. Everything I do seems so cold and feeble by its side. That is really something.\" \nClaude Debussy thought the characters and plot ludicrous, but nevertheless in 1903 wrote that musically it was: \"Incomparable and bewildering, splendid and strong. \"Parsifal\" is one of the loveliest monuments of sound ever raised to the serene glory of music.\" He was later to write to Ernest Chausson that he had deleted a scene he had just written for his own opera \"Pell\u00e9as et Melisande\" because he had discovered in the music for it \"the ghost of old Klingsor, alias R. Wagner\". Alban Berg described \"Parsifal\" in 1909 as \"magnificent, overwhelming\". \nHowever, some notable guests of the Festival took a more acerbic view of the experience. Mark Twain visited Bayreuth in 1891: \"I was not able to detect in the vocal parts of \"Parsifal\" anything that might with confidence be called rhythm or tune or melody\u2026 Singing! It does seem the wrong name to apply to it\u2026 In \"Parsifal\" there is a hermit named Gurnemanz who stands on the stage in one spot and practices by the hour, while first one and then another of the cast endures what he can of it and then retires to die.\" Performance standards may have contributed to such reactions; George Bernard Shaw, a committed Wagnerite, commented in 1894 that: \"The opening performance of \"Parsifal\" this season was, from the purely musical point of view, as far as the principal singers were concerned, simply an abomination. The bass howled, the tenor bawled, the baritone sang flat and the soprano, when she condescended to sing at all and did not merely shout her words, screamed\u2026\"\nDuring a break from composing \"The Rite of Spring\", Igor Stravinsky traveled to the Bayreuth Festival at the invitation of Sergei Diaghilev to see the work. Stravinsky was repulsed by the \"quasi-religious atmosphere\" of the festival. Stravinsky's repulsion is speculated to be due to his agnosticism, of which he recanted later in life.\nInterpretation and influence.\nWagner's last work, \"Parsifal\" has been both influential and controversial. The use of Christian symbols in \"Parsifal\" (the Grail, the spear, references to the Redeemer) together with its restriction to Bayreuth for almost 30 years sometimes led to performances being regarded almost as a religious rite. However, Wagner never actually refers to Jesus Christ by name in the opera, only to \"The Redeemer\". In his essay \"Religion and Art\", Wagner described the use of Christian imagery thus:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;When religion becomes artificial, art has a duty to rescue it. Art can show that the symbols which religions would have us believe literally true are actually figurative. Art can idealize those symbols, and so reveal the profound truths they contain.\nThe critic Eduard Hanslick objected to the religious air surrounding \"Parsifal\" even at the premiere: \"The question of whether \"Parsifal\" should really be withheld from all theatres and limited to... Bayreuth was naturally on all tongues... I must state here that the church scenes in \"Parsifal\" did not make the offensive impression on me that others and I had been led to expect from reading the libretto. They are religious situations \u2013 but for all their earnest dignity they are not in the style of the church, but completely in the style of the opera. \"Parsifal\" is an opera, call it a 'stage festival' or 'consecrational stage festival' if you will.\"\nSchopenhauer.\nWagner had been greatly impressed with his reading of the German philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer in 1854, and this deeply affected his thoughts and practice on music and art. Most writers (e.g. Bryan Magee) see \"Parsifal\" as Wagner's last great espousal of Schopenhauerian philosophy. Parsifal can heal Amfortas and redeem Kundry because he shows compassion, which Schopenhauer saw as the highest manifestation of human morality. Moreover, Parsifal displays compassion in the face of sexual temptation (act 2, scene 2); Schopenhauerian philosophy suggests that the only escape from the ever-present temptations of human life is through negation of the Will, and overcoming sexual temptation is in particular a strong form of negation of the Will. Schopenhauer also claims that compassion should be extended to non-human sentient beings as well, supporting this claim by the lives of Christian saints and mystics and the Indian religions of Hinduism and Buddhism. This worldview finds in \"Parsifal\" its expression in the holy status of animals within the Kingdom of the Grail, in the shocked response to Parsifal's \"murder\" of the swan (act 1, scene 1), which awakens in the youth the first unaware throb of compassion, or in Gurnemanz's \"sermon\" about the \"Good Friday Spell\" affecting nature and humanity's relation towards nature (act 3, scene 1). Wagner himself in his older age became an advocate of vegetarianism and an opponent of vivisection, participating in an anti-vivisectionist petition to the Reichstag in 1879; he also professed what might be called early environmentalist sentiments. As the exact opposite of compassion and therefore as the ultimate moral evil Schopenhauer sees the act of \"Schadenfreude\", the enjoying of the suffering of another living being; it is precisely this sin of which Kundry is guilty when she maliciously laughs in mocking pride at the sufferings of the Redeemer and as a result of which she falls under Klingsor's curse (recounted in act 2, scene 2), broken only at the moment when she is again capable to weep and thus express compassion during the \"Good Friday Spell\" (act 3, scene 1). When viewed in this light, \"Parsifal\", with its emphasis on \"Mitleid\" (\"compassion\") is a natural follow-on to \"Tristan und Isolde\", where Schopenhauer's influence is perhaps more obvious, with its focus on \"Sehnen\" (\"yearning\"). Indeed, Wagner originally considered including Parsifal as a character in act 3 of \"Tristan\", but later rejected the idea.\nNietzsche.\nFriedrich Nietzsche, who was originally a champion of Wagner and Schopenhauer, chose later to use \"Parsifal\" as the ground for his breach with Wagner. Nietzsche took the work as an exemplar of the self-denying, life-denying, and otherworldly Christian slave morality motivated by the \"will to nothingness,\" as opposed to the self-affirming and earthly master morality of pre-Christian ruling classes and the strong motivated by the \"will to power.\" An extended critique of \"Parsifal\" opens the third essay (\"What Is the Meaning of Ascetic Ideals?\") of \"On the Genealogy of Morality\". In \"Nietzsche contra Wagner\" he wrote: &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"Parsifal\" is a work of perfidy, of vindictiveness, of a secret attempt to poison the presuppositions of life \u2013 a bad work. The preaching of chastity remains an incitement to anti-nature: I despise everyone who does not experience \"Parsifal\" as an attempted assassination of basic ethics.\nDespite this attack on the subject matter, he also admitted that the music was sublime: \"Moreover, apart from all irrelevant questions (as to what the use of this music can or ought to be) and on purely aesthetic grounds; has Wagner ever done anything better?\" (Letter to Peter Gast, 1887).\nRacism debate.\nSome writers see in the opera a promotion of racism or antisemitism. One line of argument suggests that \"Parsifal\" was written in support of the ideas of the French diplomat and racial theorist Count Arthur de Gobineau, expressed most extensively in his \"Essay on the Inequality of the Human Races\". Parsifal is proposed as the \"pure-blooded\" (i.e. Aryan) hero who overcomes Klingsor, who is perceived as a Jewish stereotype, particularly since he opposes the quasi-Christian knights of the Grail. Such claims remain heavily debated, since there is nothing explicit in the libretto to support them. Wagner never mentions such ideas in his many writings, and Cosima Wagner's diaries, which relate in great detail Wagner's thoughts over the last 14 years of his life (including the period covering the composition and first performance of \"Parsifal\") never mention any such intention. Having met Gobineau for the first time very briefly in 1876, it was nonetheless only in 1880 that Wagner read Gobineau's essay. However, the libretto for \"Parsifal\" had already been completed by 1877, and the original drafts of the story even date back to 1857. Besides the question of chronology, an eventual meeting in person between Wagner and Gobineau was also accompanied by mutual disagreements and quarrels; e.g., on 3 June 1881 Wagner is reported to have \"exploded in favour of Christian theories in contrast to racial ones\". Despite this, Gobineau is sometimes cited as an inspiration for \"Parsifal\".\nThe related question of whether the opera contains a specifically antisemitic message is also debated. Some of Wagner's contemporaries and commentators (e.g. Hans von Wolzogen and Ernest Newman) who analysed \"Parsifal\" at length, make no mention of any antisemitic interpretations. However the critics Paul Lindau and Max Nordbeck, present at the world premiere, noted in their reviews how the work accorded with Wagner's anti-Jewish sentiments. Similar interpretive conflict continues even today; some of the more recent commentators continue to highlight the perceived antisemitic or anti-Judaic nature of the opera, and find correspondences with antisemitic passages found in Wagner's writings and articles of the period, while others deny such claims, seeing for example the opposition between the realm of the Grail and Klingsor's domain as portraying a conflict between the sphere embodying the world-view of Wagner's Schopenhauerian Christianity and a pagan sphere more generally.\nThe conductor of the premiere was Hermann Levi, the court conductor at the Munich Opera. Since King Ludwig was sponsoring the production, much of the orchestra was drawn from the ranks of the Munich Opera, including the conductor. Wagner objected to \"Parsifal\" being conducted by a Jew (Levi's father was in fact a rabbi). Wagner first suggested that Levi should convert to Christianity, which Levi declined to do. Wagner then wrote to King Ludwig that he had decided to accept Levi despite the fact that (he alleged) he had received complaints that \"of all pieces, this most Christian of works\" should be conducted by a Jew. When the King expressed his satisfaction at this, replying that \"human beings are basically all brothers\", Wagner wrote to the king angrily: \"If I have friendly and sympathetic dealings with many of these people, it is only because I consider the Jewish race as the born enemy of pure humanity and all that is noble about it (sic)\". \nSeventy-one years later, the Jewish bass-baritone George London performed in the role of Amfortas at \"Neu Bayreuth\", causing some controversy.\nIt has been claimed that \"Parsifal\" was denounced as being \"ideologically unacceptable\" in Nazi Germany and that the Nazis placed a de facto ban on \"Parsifal\" because of what many scholars see as the presence of themes such as compassion, Schopenhauerian negation of the will, renunciation of desires, asceticism and even non-violence and anti-militarism in the work's libretto. Some of the Nazi officials and leaders may have had certain doubts about the work. In his 1930 book \"The Myth of the Twentieth Century\" the Nazi ideologue Alfred Rosenberg expressed the view that \"\"Parsifal\" represents a church-influenced enfeeblement in favour of the value of renunciation\". According to Joseph Goebbels' diaries, Adolf Hitler too had apparently some reservations about \"Parsifal\", particularly about what he called its \"Christian mystical style\". Despite this, there were in fact 26 performances at the Bayreuth Festival between 1934 and 1939 and 23 performances at the Deutsche Oper Berlin between 1939 and 1942. However, \"Parsifal\" was not performed at Bayreuth during World War II, a significant omission since the work, with the exception of one year, had been an annual fixture of the Festival since 1882.\nMusic.\nLeitmotifs.\nA \"leitmotif\" is a recurring musical theme within a particular piece of music, associated with a particular character, object, event or emotion. Wagner is the composer most often associated with leitmotifs, and \"Parsifal\" makes liberal use of them. Wagner did not specifically identify or name leitmotifs in the score of \"Parsifal\" (any more than he did in any other of his scores), although his wife Cosima mentions statements he made about some of them in her diary. However, Wagner's followers (notably Hans von Wolzogen whose guide to \"Parsifal\" was published in 1882) named, wrote about and made references to these motifs, and they were highlighted in piano arrangements of the score. Wagner's own reaction to such naming of motifs in the score was one of disgust: \"In the end people believe that such nonsense happens by my suggestion.\"\nThe opening prelude introduces two important leitmotifs, generally referred to as the \"Communion\" theme and the theme of the \"Grail\". These two, and Parsifal's own motif, are repeated during the course of the opera. Other characters, especially Klingsor, Amfortas, and \"The Voice\", which sings the so-called \"Tormotif\" (\"Fool's motive\"), have their own particular leitmotifs. Wagner uses the Dresden amen to represent the Grail, this motif being a sequence of notes he would have known since his childhood in Dresden.\nChromaticism.\nMany music theorists have used \"Parsifal\" to explore difficulties in analyzing the chromaticism of late 19th century music. Theorists such as David Lewin and Richard Cohn have explored the importance of certain pitches and harmonic progressions both in structuring and symbolizing the work. The unusual harmonic progressions in the leitmotifs which structure the piece, as well as the heavy chromaticism of act 2, make it a difficult work to parse musically.\nNotable excerpts.\nAs is common in mature Wagner operas, \"Parsifal\" was composed such that each act was a continuous flow of music; hence there are no free-standing arias in the work. However, a number of orchestral excerpts from the opera were arranged by Wagner himself, and remain in the concert repertory. The prelude to act 1 is frequently performed either alone or in conjunction with an arrangement of the \"Good Friday\" music which accompanies the second half of act 3, scene 1. Kundry's long solo in act 2 (\") is occasionally performed in concert, as is Amfortas' lament from act 1 (\").\nInstrumentation.\nThe score for \"Parsifal\" calls for three flutes, three oboes, one English horn, three clarinets in B-flat and A, one bass clarinet in B-flat and A, three bassoons, one contrabassoon; four horns in F, three trumpets in F, three trombones, one tuba, 6 onstage trumpets in F, 6 onstage trombones; a percussion section that includes four timpani (requiring two players), tenor drums, 4 onstage church bells, one onstage thunder machine; two harps and strings. \"Parsifal\" is one of only two works by Wagner in which he used the contrabassoon. (The other is the \"Symphony in C\".)\nThe bells that draw the knights to the Grail ceremony at Monsalvat in acts 1 and 3 have often proved problematic to stage. For the earlier performances of \"Parsifal\" in Bayreuth, Wagner had the Parsifal bell, a piano frame with four strings, constructed as a substitute for church bells. For the first performances, the bells were combined with tam-tam and gongs. However, the bell was used with the tuba, four tam-tams tuned to the pitch of the four chime notes and another tam-tam on which a roll is executed by using a drumstick. In modern-day performances, the Parsifal bell has been replaced with tubular bells or synthesizers to produce the desired notes. The thunder machine is used in the moment of the destruction of Klingsor's castle.\nRecordings.\n\"Parsifal\" was expressly composed for the stage at Bayreuth and many of the most famous recordings of the opera come from live performances on that stage. In the pre-LP era, Karl Muck conducted excerpts from the opera at Bayreuth. These are still considered some of the best performances of the opera on disc. They also contain the only sound evidence of the bells constructed for the work's premiere, which were melted down for scrap during World War II.\nHans Knappertsbusch was the conductor most closely associated with \"Parsifal\" at Bayreuth in the post-war years, and the performances under his baton in 1951 marked the re-opening of the Bayreuth Festival after World War II. These historic performances were recorded and are available on the Teldec label in mono sound. Knappertsbusch recorded the opera again for Philips in 1962 in stereo, and this release is often considered to be the classic \"Parsifal\" recording. There are also many \"unofficial\" live recordings from Bayreuth, capturing virtually every \"Parsifal\" cast ever conducted by Knappertsbusch. Pierre Boulez (1971) and James Levine (1985) have also made recordings of the opera at Bayreuth that were released on Deutsche Grammophon and Philips. The Boulez recording is one of the fastest on record, and the Levine one of the slowest.\nAmongst other recordings, those conducted by Georg Solti, James Levine (with the Metropolitan Opera Orchestra), Herbert von Karajan, and Daniel Barenboim (the latter two both conducting the Berlin Philharmonic) have been widely praised. The Karajan recording was voted \"Record of the Year\" in the 1981 Gramophone Awards. Also highly regarded is a recording of \"Parsifal\" under the baton of Rafael Kubel\u00edk originally made for Deutsche Grammophon, now reissued on Arts &amp; Archives.\nOn the 14 December 2013 broadcast of BBC Radio 3's CD Review \u2013 Building a Library, music critic David Nice surveyed recordings of \"Parsifal\" and recommended the recording by the Symphonieorchester des Bayerischen Rundfunks, Rafael Kubelik (conductor), as the best available choice.\nFilmed versions.\nIn addition to a number of staged performances available on DVD, \"Parsifal\" was adapted for the screen by Daniel Mangran\u00e9 in 1951 and Hans-J\u00fcrgen Syberberg in 1982. There is also a 1998 documentary directed by Tony Palmer titled: \"Parsifal \u2013 The Search for the Grail\". It was recorded in various European theaters, including the Mariinsky Theatre, the Ravello Festival in Siena, and the Bayreuth Festival. It contains extracts from Palmer's stage production of \"Parsifal\" starring Pl\u00e1cido Domingo, Violeta Urmana, Matti Salminen, Nikolai Putilin, and Anna Netrebko.

Modern uniforms are most often worn by armed forces and paramilitary organizations such as police, emergency services, security guards, in some workplaces and schools, and by inmates in prisons. In some countries, some other officials also wear uniforms in their duties; such is the case of the Commissioned Corps of the United States Public Health Service or the French prefects. For some organizations, such as police, it may be illegal for non-members to wear the uniform.\nEtymology.\nFrom the Latin \"unus\" (meaning one), and \"forma\" (meaning form).\nVariants.\nCorporate and work uniforms.\nWorkers sometimes wear uniforms or corporate clothing of one nature or another. Workers required to wear a uniform may include retail workers, bank and post-office workers, public-security and health-care workers, blue-collar employees, personal trainers in health clubs, instructors in summer camps, lifeguards, janitors, public-transit employees, towing- and truck-drivers, airline employees and holiday operators, and bar, restaurant and hotel employees. The use of uniforms in commercial or public-service organizations often reflects an effort in branding and in developing a standard corporate image; it also has important effects on the employees required to wear uniforms.\nThe term \"uniform\" may be misleading because employees are not always fully uniform in appearance and may not always wear attire provided by the organization, while still representing the organization in their attire. Academic work on organizational dress by Rafaeli &amp; Pratt (1993) referred to uniformity (homogeneity) of dress as one dimension, and conspicuousness as a second. Employees all wearing black, for example, may appear conspicuous and thus represent the organization even though their attire is uniform only in the color of their clothing, not in its features. Pratt &amp; Rafaeli, (1997) described struggles between employees and management about organizational dress as struggles about deeper meanings and identities that dress represents. And Pratt &amp; Rafaeli (2001) described dress as one of the larger set of symbols and artifacts in organizations, which coalesce into a communication grammar.\nArmed forces and security.\nMilitary uniform is the standardised costume worn by members of the armed forces and paramilitaries of various nations. Military dress and military styles have gone through great changes over the centuries from colourful and elaborate to utilitarian camouflage uniforms for field and battle purposes. Military uniforms in the form of standardised and distinctive dress, intended for identification and display, are typically a sign of organised military forces equipped by a central authority. Most military forces have developed several different uniform types.\nMilitary personnel in most armed forces and some civilian officials may wear some or all of the following: combat uniform, service dress, dress uniform, full dress uniform, mess dress.\nMedical workers.\nUniforms can distinguish various categories of staff in medical institutions: doctors, surgeons, nurses, ancillary staff and volunteers.\nTraditional female nurses' uniforms resemble uniforms (habits) worn by religious orders.\nEquipment - notably stethoscopes - worn like a badge of office, may accompany or replace medical uniforms.\nEducational.\nUniforms are required for students in many schools in different countries. School uniforms vary from a standard issue T-shirt to rigorous requirements for many items of formal wear at private schools. School uniforms are in place in many public schools as well.\nCountries where mandatory school uniforms are common include Japan, South Korea, Hong Kong, Thailand, India, Australia, UAE, Singapore, Albania, Philippines, some schools in Taiwan, New Zealand, South Africa, Indonesia and the United Kingdom, among many other places. In some countries, uniform types vary from school to school, in the United Kingdom, many pupils between 11 and 16 of age wear a blazer, tie and trousers for boys and blouse, tie and trousers, skirt, or culottes for girls. The ties tend to have a set pattern or a logo embroidered representing the school, and jackets will usually carry a badge on the breast pocket with the school's name, coat of arms, and motto or emblem. Children in many British state primary schools will have a uniform jumper and/or polo shirt with the school name and logo.\nSome universities in the DPRK require students to wear uniforms.\nDiplomats.\nFrom about 1800 to after the Second World War, diplomats from most countries (and often senior non-military officials generally) wore official uniforms at public occasions. Such uniforms are now retained by only a few diplomatic services, and are seldom worn.\nPolice.\nMembers of the police in every country have a uniform for identification as law-enforcement personnel or agents. They are distinguished from the public by the uniform the police wear during overt policing activity. Usually each country has its own different police uniform.\nContrast plainclothes law enforcement and undercover operations.\nSports.\nMost, if not all, sports teams also wear uniforms, made in the team's distinctive colors. In individual sports like tennis and golf, players may choose any clothing design allowed by the competition rules.\nTo prevent the confusion (for officials, players, and fans) that might result from two opposing teams wearing uniforms (kits) with similar colors, teams have different variations for \"home\" and \"away\" games, where typically one is dark and the other is light. In the four major North American sports leagues, one of the two uniforms is almost always predominantly white, and each league except for the National Basketball Association (NBA) has a rule to determine which team should normally wear its white uniform. Customarily, National Football League (NFL) and National Hockey League (NHL) teams wear their \"color\" uniforms for home games. By contrast, Major League Baseball (MLB) teams wear their \"white\" uniforms for home games. The NBA traditionally required home teams to wear white, or at least a light color, but as of the \u00a0season allows home teams to wear any uniform color, mandating only that away teams wear a color that sufficiently contrasts with the home team's choice. These rules are not strictly enforced, however, for any of the four major professional sports leagues in North America. Some NFL teams, most notably the Dallas Cowboys, prefer to wear their white jerseys for home games. When Joe Gibbs was the head coach of the Washington Redskins \u2014 first from 1981 to 1992, and again from 2004 to 2007 \u2014 the Redskins exclusively wore white jerseys at home games. In the United Kingdom, especially in football, the terms \"kit\" or \"strip\" (as in 'football kit') are more common (instead of uniform).\nDomestic workers.\nDomestic workers are often required by their employers-managers to wear a uniform.\nPrison.\nA prison uniform is any uniform worn by individuals incarcerated in a prison, jail or similar facility of detention.\nBeautician.\nThe beauticians use uniforms to protect their skin from harmful chemicals and acid. These chemical resistant and water proof uniforms are not only safe to work in but also provide a professional, polished appearance throughout the day.\nScouting.\nThe Scout uniform is a specific characteristic of the Scouting movement, in the words of Baden-Powell at the 1937 World Jamboree, \"it covers the differences of country and race and makes all feel that they are members one with another of one World Brotherhood\". The original uniform, which has created a familiar image in the public eye, consisted of a khaki button-up shirt, shorts and a broad-brimmed campaign hat. Baden-Powell himself wore shorts since being dressed like the youth contributed to reducing perceived \"distance\" between the adult and the young person. Nowadays, uniforms are frequently blue, orange, red, or green, and shorts are replaced by long pants in areas where the culture calls for modesty, and in winter weather. The campaign hats have also been dropped in some Scouting organisations.\nButtons.\nSome uniforms have specially-manufactured buttons, which, in the case of antiques, often outlast the fabric components of the uniform, and become highly collectable items. Nowadays, buttons come in different materials, shapes sizes and colors.\nHygiene.\nIn some countries or regions such as the UK, Australia or Hong Kong, the cost of cleaning one's uniform or work clothing can be partially deducted or rebated from the personal income tax, if the organization for which the person works does not have a laundry department or an outsourced commercial laundry.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "38238", "revid": "50489311", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=38238", "title": "Hepatitis", "text": "Inflammation of the liver\nMedical condition&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Infobox/styles-images.css\" /&gt;\nHepatitis is inflammation of the liver tissue. Some people or animals with hepatitis have no symptoms, whereas others develop yellow discoloration of the skin and whites of the eyes (jaundice), poor appetite, vomiting, tiredness, abdominal pain, and diarrhea. Hepatitis is \"acute\" if it resolves within six months, and \"chronic\" if it lasts longer than six months. Acute hepatitis can resolve on its own, progress to chronic hepatitis, or (rarely) result in acute liver failure. Chronic hepatitis may progress to scarring of the liver (cirrhosis), liver failure, and liver cancer.\nHepatitis is most commonly caused by the virus \"hepatovirus A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\", and \"E\". Other viruses can also cause liver inflammation, including cytomegalovirus, Epstein\u2013Barr virus, and yellow fever virus. Other common causes of hepatitis include heavy alcohol use, certain medications, toxins, other infections, autoimmune diseases, and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Hepatitis A and E are mainly spread by contaminated food and water. Hepatitis B is mainly sexually transmitted, but may also be passed from mother to baby during pregnancy or childbirth and spread through infected blood. Hepatitis C is commonly spread through infected blood; for example, during needle sharing by intravenous drug users. Hepatitis D can only infect people already infected with hepatitis B.\nHepatitis A, B, and D are preventable with immunization. Medications may be used to treat chronic viral hepatitis. Antiviral medications are recommended in all with chronic hepatitis C, except those with conditions that limit their life expectancy. There is no specific treatment for NASH; physical activity, a healthy diet, and weight loss are recommended. Autoimmune hepatitis may be treated with medications to suppress the immune system. A liver transplant may be an option in both acute and chronic liver failure.\nWorldwide in 2015, hepatitis A occurred in about 114 million people, chronic hepatitis B affected about 343 million people and chronic hepatitis C about 142 million people. In the United States, NASH affects about 11 million people and alcoholic hepatitis affects about 5 million people. Hepatitis results in more than a million deaths a year, most of which occur indirectly from liver scarring or liver cancer. In the United States, hepatitis A is estimated to occur in about 2,500 people a year and results in about 75 deaths. The word is derived from the Greek \"h\u00eapar\" (), meaning \"liver\", and \"-itis\" (), meaning \"inflammation\".\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSigns and symptoms.\nHepatitis has a broad spectrum of presentations that range from a complete lack of symptoms to severe\u00a0liver failure. The acute form of hepatitis, generally caused by viral infection, is characterized by\u00a0constitutional symptoms\u00a0that are typically self-limiting. Chronic hepatitis presents similarly, but can manifest signs and symptoms specific to liver dysfunction with long-standing inflammation and damage to the organ.\nAcute hepatitis.\nAcute viral hepatitis follows three distinct phases:\nOccasionally, however, acute hepatitis can cause liver failure. Liver failure can be life threatening and may lead to a coma or even death.\nBoth drug-induced hepatitis and autoimmune hepatitis can present very similarly to acute viral hepatitis, with slight variations in symptoms depending on the cause. Cases of drug-induced hepatitis can manifest with systemic signs of an allergic reaction including rash, fever, serositis (inflammation of membranes lining certain organs), elevated eosinophils (a type of white blood cell), and suppression of bone marrow activity.\nFulminant hepatitis.\nFulminant hepatitis, or massive hepatic cell death, is a rare and life-threatening complication of acute hepatitis that can occur in cases of hepatitis B, D, and E, in addition to drug-induced and autoimmune hepatitis. The complication more frequently occurs in instances of hepatitis B and D co-infection at a rate of 2\u201320% and in pregnant women with hepatitis E at rate of 15\u201320% of cases. In addition to the signs of acute hepatitis, people can also demonstrate signs of coagulopathy (abnormal coagulation studies with easy bruising and bleeding) and encephalopathy (confusion, disorientation, and sleepiness). Mortality due to fulminant hepatitis is typically the result of various complications including cerebral edema, gastrointestinal bleeding, sepsis, respiratory failure, or kidney failure.\nChronic hepatitis.\nAcute cases of hepatitis are seen to be resolved well within a six-month period. When hepatitis is continued for more than six months it is termed chronic hepatitis. Chronic hepatitis is often asymptomatic early in its course and is detected only by liver laboratory studies for screening purposes or to evaluate non-specific symptoms. As the inflammation progresses, patients can develop constitutional symptoms similar to acute hepatitis, including fatigue, nausea, vomiting, poor appetite, and joint pain. Jaundice can occur as well, but much later in the disease process and is typically a sign of advanced disease. Chronic hepatitis interferes with hormonal functions of the liver which can result in acne, hirsutism (abnormal hair growth), and amenorrhea (lack of menstrual period) in women. Extensive damage and scarring of the liver over time defines cirrhosis, a condition in which the liver's ability to function is permanently impeded. This results in jaundice, weight loss, coagulopathy, ascites (abdominal fluid collection), and peripheral edema (leg swelling). Cirrhosis can lead to other life-threatening complications such as hepatic encephalopathy, esophageal varices, hepatorenal syndrome, and liver cancer.\nCauses.\nCauses of hepatitis can be divided into the following major categories: infectious, metabolic, ischemic, autoimmune, genetic, and other. Infectious agents include viruses, bacteria, and parasites. Metabolic causes include prescription medications, toxins (most notably alcohol), and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Autoimmune and genetic causes of hepatitis involve genetic predispositions and tend to affect characteristic populations.\nInfectious.\nViral hepatitis.\nViral hepatitis is the most common type of hepatitis worldwide, especially in Asia and Africa. Viral hepatitis is caused by five different viruses (hepatitis A, B, C, D, and E). Hepatitis A and hepatitis E behave similarly: they are both transmitted by the fecal\u2013oral route, are more common in developing countries, and are self-limiting illnesses that do not lead to chronic hepatitis.\nHepatitis B, hepatitis C, and hepatitis D are transmitted when blood or mucous membranes are exposed to infected blood and body fluids, such as semen and vaginal secretions. Viral particles have also been found in saliva and breastmilk. Kissing, sharing utensils, and breastfeeding do not lead to transmission unless these fluids are introduced into open sores or cuts. Many families who do not have safe drinking water or live in unhygienic homes have contracted hepatitis because saliva and blood droplets are often carried through the water and blood-borne illnesses spread quickly in unsanitary settings.\nHepatitis B and C can present either acutely or chronically. Hepatitis D is a defective virus that requires hepatitis B to replicate and is only found with hepatitis B co-infection. In adults, hepatitis B infection is most commonly self-limiting, with less than 5% progressing to chronic state, and 20 to 30% of those chronically infected developing cirrhosis or liver cancer. Infection in infants and children frequently leads to chronic infection.\nUnlike hepatitis B, most cases of hepatitis C lead to chronic infection. Hepatitis C is the second most common cause of cirrhosis in the US (second to alcoholic hepatitis). In the 1970s and 1980s, blood transfusions were a major factor in spreading hepatitis C virus. Since widespread screening of blood products for hepatitis C began in 1992, the risk of acquiring hepatitis C from a blood transfusion has decreased from approximately 10% in the 1970s to 1 in 2 million currently.\nParasitic hepatitis.\nParasites can also infect the liver and activate the immune response, resulting in symptoms of acute hepatitis with increased serum IgE (though chronic hepatitis is possible with chronic infections). Of the protozoans, Trypanosoma cruzi, Leishmania species, and the malaria-causing Plasmodium species all can cause liver inflammation. Another protozoan, Entamoeba histolytica, causes hepatitis with distinct liver abscesses.\nOf the worms, the cestode Echinococcus granulosus, also known as the dog tapeworm, infects the liver and forms characteristic hepatic hydatid cysts. The liver flukes Fasciola hepatica and Clonorchis sinensis live in the bile ducts and cause progressive hepatitis and liver fibrosis.\nBacterial hepatitis.\nBacterial infection of the liver commonly results in pyogenic liver abscesses, acute hepatitis, or granulomatous (or chronic) liver disease. Pyogenic abscesses commonly involve enteric bacteria such as \"Escherichia coli\" and \"Klebsiella pneumoniae\" and are composed of multiple bacteria up to 50% of the time. Acute hepatitis is caused by \"Neisseria meningitidis\", \"Neisseria gonorrhoeae\", \"Bartonella henselae\", \"Borrelia burgdorferi\", salmonella species, brucella species and campylobacter species. Chronic or granulomatous hepatitis is seen with infection from mycobacteria species, \"Tropheryma whipplei\", \"Treponema pallidum\", \"Coxiella burnetii\", and rickettsia species.\nMetabolic.\nAlcoholic hepatitis.\nExcessive alcohol consumption is a significant cause of hepatitis and is the most common cause of cirrhosis in the U.S. Alcoholic hepatitis is within the spectrum of alcoholic liver disease. This ranges in order of severity and reversibility from alcoholic steatosis (least severe, most reversible), alcoholic hepatitis, cirrhosis, and liver cancer (most severe, least reversible). Hepatitis usually develops over years-long exposure to alcohol, occurring in 10 to 20% of alcoholics. The most important risk factors for the development of alcoholic hepatitis are quantity and duration of alcohol intake. Long-term alcohol intake in excess of 80 grams of alcohol a day in men and 40 grams a day in women is associated with development of alcoholic hepatitis (1 beer or 4 ounces of wine is equivalent to 12g of alcohol). Alcoholic hepatitis can vary from asymptomatic hepatomegaly (enlarged liver) to symptoms of acute or chronic hepatitis to liver failure.\nToxic and drug-induced hepatitis.\nMany chemical agents, including medications, industrial toxins, and herbal and dietary supplements, can cause hepatitis. The spectrum of drug-induced liver injury varies from acute hepatitis to chronic hepatitis to acute liver failure. Toxins and medications can cause liver injury through a variety of mechanisms, including direct cell damage, disruption of cell metabolism, and causing structural changes. Some drugs such as paracetamol exhibit predictable dose-dependent liver damage while others such as isoniazid cause idiosyncratic and unpredictable reactions that vary by person. There are wide variations in the mechanisms of liver injury and latency period from exposure to development of clinical illness.\nMany types of drugs can cause liver injury, including the analgesic paracetamol; antibiotics such as isoniazid, nitrofurantoin, amoxicillin-clavulanate, erythromycin, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole; anticonvulsants such as valproate and phenytoin; cholesterol-lowering statins; steroids such as oral contraceptives and anabolic steroids; and highly active anti-retroviral therapy used in the treatment of HIV/AIDS. Of these, amoxicillin-clavulanate is the most common cause of drug-induced liver injury, and paracetamol toxicity the most common cause of acute liver failure in the United States and Europe.\nHerbal remedies and dietary supplements are another important cause of hepatitis; these are the most common causes of drug-induced hepatitis in Korea. The United States\u2013based Drug Induced Liver Injury Network linked more than 16% of cases of hepatotoxicity to herbal and dietary supplements. In the United States, herbal and dietary supplements \u2013 unlike pharmaceutical drugs \u2013 are unregulated by the Food and Drug Administration. The National Institutes of Health maintains the LiverTox database for consumers to track all known prescription and non-prescription compounds associated with liver injury.\nExposure to other hepatotoxins can occur accidentally or intentionally through ingestion, inhalation, and skin absorption. The industrial toxin carbon tetrachloride and the wild mushroom Amanita phalloides are other known hepatotoxins.\nNon-alcoholic fatty liver disease.\nNon-alcoholic hepatitis is within the spectrum of non-alcoholic liver disease (NALD), which ranges in severity and reversibility from non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) to cirrhosis to liver cancer, similar to the spectrum of alcoholic liver disease.\nNon-alcoholic liver disease occurs in people with little or no history of alcohol use, and is instead strongly associated with metabolic syndrome, obesity, insulin resistance and diabetes, and hypertriglyceridemia. Over time, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease can progress to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, which additionally involves liver cell death, liver inflammation and possible fibrosis. Factors accelerating progression from NAFLD to NASH are obesity, older age, non-African American ethnicity, female gender, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, higher ALT or AST level, higher AST/ALT ratio, low platelet count, and an ultrasound steatosis score.\nIn the early stages (as with NAFLD and early NASH), most patients are asymptomatic or have mild right upper quadrant pain, and diagnosis is suspected on the basis of abnormal liver function tests. As the disease progresses, symptoms typical of chronic hepatitis may develop. While imaging can show fatty liver, only liver biopsy can demonstrate inflammation and fibrosis characteristic of NASH. 9 to 25% of patients with NASH develop cirrhosis. NASH is recognized as the third most common cause of liver disease in the United States.\nAutoimmune.\nAutoimmune hepatitis is a chronic disease caused by an abnormal immune response against liver cells. The disease is thought to have a genetic predisposition as it is associated with certain human leukocyte antigens involved in the immune response. As in other autoimmune diseases, circulating auto-antibodies may be present and are helpful in diagnosis. Auto-antibodies found in patients with autoimmune hepatitis include the sensitive but less specific anti-nuclear antibody (ANA), smooth muscle antibody (SMA), and atypical perinuclear antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (p-ANCA). Other autoantibodies that are less common but more specific to autoimmune hepatitis are the antibodies against liver kidney microsome 1 (LKM1) and soluble liver antigen (SLA). Autoimmune hepatitis can also be triggered by drugs (such as nitrofurantoin, hydralazine, and methyldopa), after liver transplant, or by viruses (such as hepatitis A, Epstein-Barr virus, or measles).\nAutoimmune hepatitis can present anywhere within the spectrum from asymptomatic to acute or chronic hepatitis to fulminant liver failure. Patients are asymptomatic 25\u201334% of the time, and the diagnosis is suspected on the basis of abnormal liver function tests. Some studies show between 25% and 75% of cases present with signs and symptoms of acute hepatitis. As with other autoimmune diseases, autoimmune hepatitis usually affects young females (though it can affect patients of either sex of any age), and patients can exhibit classic signs and symptoms of autoimmunity such as fatigue, anemia, anorexia, amenorrhea, acne, arthritis, pleurisy, thyroiditis, ulcerative colitis, nephritis, and maculopapular rash. Autoimmune hepatitis increases the risk for cirrhosis, and the risk for liver cancer is increased by about 1% for each year of the disease.\nMany people with autoimmune hepatitis have other autoimmune diseases. Autoimmune hepatitis is distinct from the other autoimmune diseases of the liver, primary biliary cirrhosis and primary sclerosing cholangitis, both of which can also lead to scarring, fibrosis, and cirrhosis of the liver.\nGenetic.\nGenetic causes of hepatitis include alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency, hemochromatosis, and Wilson's disease. In alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency, a co-dominant mutation in the gene for alpha-1-antitrypsin results in the abnormal accumulation of the mutant AAT protein within liver cells, leading to liver disease. Hemochromatosis and Wilson's disease are both autosomal recessive diseases involving abnormal storage of minerals. In hemochromatosis, excess amounts of iron accumulate in multiple body sites, including the liver, which can lead to cirrhosis. In Wilson's disease, excess amounts of copper accumulate in the liver and brain, causing cirrhosis and dementia.\nWhen the liver is involved, alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency and Wilson's disease tend to present as hepatitis in the neonatal period or in childhood. Hemochromatosis typically presents in adulthood, with the onset of clinical disease usually after age 50.\nIschemic hepatitis.\nIschemic hepatitis (also known as shock liver) results from reduced blood flow to the liver as in shock, heart failure, or vascular insufficiency. The condition is most often associated with heart failure but can also be caused by shock or sepsis. Blood testing of a person with ischemic hepatitis will show very high levels of transaminase enzymes (AST and ALT). The condition usually resolves if the underlying cause is treated successfully. Ischemic hepatitis rarely causes permanent liver damage.\nOther.\nHepatitis can also occur in neonates and is attributable to a variety of causes, some of which are not typically seen in adults. Congenital or perinatal infection with the hepatitis viruses, toxoplasma, rubella, cytomegalovirus, and syphilis can cause neonatal hepatitis. Structural abnormalities such as biliary atresia and choledochal cysts can lead to cholestatic liver injury leading to neonatal hepatitis. Metabolic diseases such as glycogen storage disorders and lysosomal storage disorders are also implicated. Neonatal hepatitis can be idiopathic, and in such cases, biopsy often shows large multinucleated cells in the liver tissue. This disease is termed giant cell hepatitis and may be associated with viral infection, autoimmune disorders, and drug toxicity.\nMechanism.\nThe specific mechanism varies and depends on the underlying cause of the hepatitis. Generally, there is an initial insult that causes liver injury and activation of an inflammatory response, which can become chronic, leading to progressive fibrosis and cirrhosis.\nViral hepatitis.\nThe pathway by which hepatic viruses cause viral hepatitis is best understood in the case of hepatitis B and C. The viruses do not directly activate apoptosis (cell death). Rather, infection of liver cells activates the innate and adaptive arms of the immune system leading to an inflammatory response which causes cellular damage and death, including viral-induced apoptosis via the induction of the death receptor-mediated signaling pathway. Depending on the strength of the immune response, the types of immune cells involved and the ability of the virus to evade the body's defense, infection can either lead to clearance (acute disease) or persistence (chronic disease) of the virus. The chronic presence of the virus within liver cells results in multiple waves of inflammation, injury and wound healing that over time lead to scarring or fibrosis and culminate in hepatocellular carcinoma. People with impaired immune response are at greater risk of developing chronic infection. Natural killer cells are the primary drivers of the initial innate response and create a cytokine environment that results in the recruitment of CD4 T-helper and CD8 cytotoxic T-cells. Type I interferons are the cytokines that drive the antiviral response. In chronic Hepatitis B and C, natural killer cell function is impaired.\nSteatohepatitis.\nSteatohepatitis is seen in both alcoholic and non-alcoholic liver disease and is the culmination of a cascade of events that began with injury. In the case of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, this cascade is initiated by changes in metabolism associated with obesity, insulin resistance, and lipid dysregulation. In alcoholic hepatitis, chronic excess alcohol use is the culprit. Though the inciting event may differ, the progression of events is similar and begins with accumulation of free fatty acids (FFA) and their breakdown products in the liver cells in a process called steatosis. This initially reversible process overwhelms the hepatocyte's ability to maintain lipid homeostasis leading to a toxic effect as fat molecules accumulate and are broken down in the setting of an oxidative stress response. Over time, this abnormal lipid deposition triggers the immune system via toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) resulting in the production of inflammatory cytokines such as TNF that cause liver cell injury and death. These events mark the transition to steatohepatitis and in the setting of chronic injury, fibrosis eventually develops setting up events that lead to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Microscopically, changes that can be seen include steatosis with large and swollen hepatocytes (ballooning), evidence of cellular injury and cell death (apoptosis, necrosis), evidence of inflammation in particular in zone 3 of the liver, variable degrees of fibrosis and Mallory bodies.\nDiagnosis.\nDiagnosis of hepatitis is made on the basis of some or all of the following: a person's signs and symptoms, medical history including sexual and substance use history, blood tests, imaging, and liver biopsy. In general, for viral hepatitis and other acute causes of hepatitis, the person's blood tests and clinical picture are sufficient for diagnosis. For other causes of hepatitis, especially chronic causes, blood tests may not be useful. In this case, liver biopsy is the gold standard for establishing the diagnosis: histopathologic analysis is able to reveal the precise extent and pattern of inflammation and fibrosis. Biopsy is typically not the initial diagnostic test because it is invasive and is associated with a small but significant risk of bleeding that is increased in people with liver injury and cirrhosis.\nBlood testing includes liver enzymes, serology (i.e. for autoantibodies), nucleic acid testing (i.e. for hepatitis virus DNA/RNA), blood chemistry, and complete blood count. Characteristic patterns of liver enzyme abnormalities can point to certain causes or stages of hepatitis. Generally, AST and ALT are elevated in most cases of hepatitis regardless of whether the person shows any symptoms. The degree of elevation (i.e. levels in the hundreds vs. in the thousands), the predominance for AST vs. ALT elevation, and the ratio between AST and ALT are informative of the diagnosis.\nUltrasound, CT, and MRI can all identify steatosis (fatty changes) of the liver tissue and nodularity of the liver surface suggestive of cirrhosis. CT and especially MRI are able to provide a higher level of detail, allowing visualization and characterize such structures as vessels and tumors within the liver. Unlike steatosis and cirrhosis, no imaging test is able to detect liver inflammation (i.e. hepatitis) or fibrosis. Liver biopsy is the only definitive diagnostic test that is able to assess inflammation and fibrosis of the liver.\nViral hepatitis.\nViral hepatitis is primarily diagnosed through blood tests for levels of viral antigens (such as the hepatitis B surface or core antigen), anti-viral antibodies (such as the anti-hepatitis B surface antibody or anti-hepatitis A antibody), or viral DNA/RNA. In early infection (i.e. within 1 week), IgM antibodies are found in the blood. In late infection and after recovery, IgG antibodies are present and remain in the body for up to years. Therefore, when a patient is positive for IgG antibody but negative for IgM antibody, he is considered immune from the virus via either prior infection and recovery or prior vaccination.\nIn the case of hepatitis B, blood tests exist for multiple virus antigens (which are different components of the ) and antibodies. The combination of antigen and antibody positivity can provide information about the stage of infection (acute or chronic), the degree of viral replication, and the infectivity of the virus.\nAlcoholic versus non-alcoholic.\nThe most apparent distinguishing factor between alcoholic steatohepatitis (ASH) and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a history of excessive alcohol use. Thus, in patients who have no or negligible alcohol use, the diagnosis is unlikely to be alcoholic hepatitis. In those who drink alcohol, the diagnosis may just as likely be alcoholic or nonalcoholic hepatitis especially if there is concurrent obesity, diabetes, and metabolic syndrome. In this case, alcoholic and nonalcoholic hepatitis can be distinguished by the pattern of liver enzyme abnormalities; specifically, in alcoholic steatohepatitis AST&gt;ALT with ratio of AST:ALT&gt;2:1 while in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis ALT&gt;AST with ratio of ALT:AST&gt;1.5:1.\nLiver biopsies show identical findings in patients with ASH and NASH, specifically, the presence of polymorphonuclear infiltration, hepatocyte necrosis and apoptosis in the form of ballooning degeneration, Mallory bodies, and fibrosis around veins and sinuses.\nVirus screening.\nThe purpose of screening for viral hepatitis is to identify people infected with the disease as early as possible, even before symptoms and transaminase elevations may be present. This allows for early treatment, which can both prevent disease progression and decrease the likelihood of transmission to others.\nHepatitis A.\nHepatitis A causes an acute illness that does not progress to chronic liver disease. Therefore, the role of screening is to assess immune status in people who are at high risk of contracting the virus, as well as in people with known liver disease for whom hepatitis A infection could lead to liver failure. People in these groups who are not already immune can receive the hepatitis A vaccine.\nThose at high risk and in need of screening include:\nThe presence of anti-hepatitis A IgG in the blood indicates past infection with the virus or prior vaccination.\nHepatitis B.\nThe CDC, WHO, USPSTF, and ACOG recommend routine hepatitis B screening for certain high-risk populations. Specifically, these populations include people who are:\nScreening consists of a blood test that detects hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg). If HBsAg is present, a second test \u2013 usually done on the same blood sample \u2013 that detects the antibody for the hepatitis B core antigen (anti-HBcAg) can differentiate between acute and chronic infection. People who are high-risk whose blood tests negative for HBsAg can receive the hepatitis B vaccine to prevent future infection.\nHepatitis C.\nThe CDC, WHO, USPSTF, AASLD, and ACOG recommend screening people at high risk for hepatitis C infection. These populations include people who are:\nFor people in the groups above whose exposure is ongoing, screening should be periodic, though there is no set optimal screening interval. The AASLD recommends screening men who have sex with men who are HIV-positive annually. People born in the US between 1945 and 1965 should be screened once (unless they have other exposure risks).\nScreening consists of a blood test that detects anti-hepatitis C virus antibody. If anti-hepatitis C virus antibody is present, a confirmatory test to detect HCV RNA indicates chronic disease.\nHepatitis D.\nThe CDC, WHO, USPSTF, AASLD, and ACOG recommend screening people at high risk for hepatitis D infection. These populations include people who are:\nHepatitis D is extremely rare. Symptoms include chronic diarrhea, anal and intestinal blisters, purple urine, and burnt-popcorn-scented breath.\nScreening consists of a blood test that detects the anti-hepatitis D virus antibody. If the anti-hepatitis D virus antibody is present, a confirmatory test to detect HDV RNA DNA indicates chronic disease.\nPrevention.\nVaccines.\nHepatitis A.\nThe CDC recommends the hepatitis A vaccine for all children beginning at age one, as well as for those who have not been previously immunized and are at high risk for contracting the disease.\nFor children 12 months of age or older, the vaccination is given as a shot into the muscle in two doses 6\u201318 months apart and should be started before the age 24 months. \u00a0The dosing is slightly different for adults depending on the type of the vaccine. \u00a0If the vaccine is for hepatitis A only, two doses are given 6\u201318 months apart depending on the manufacturer. \u00a0If the vaccine is combined hepatitis A and hepatitis B, up to 4 doses may be required.\nHepatitis B.\nThe CDC recommends the routine vaccination of all children under the age of 19 with the hepatitis B vaccine. They also recommend it for those who desire it or are at high risk.\nRoutine vaccination for hepatitis B starts with the first dose administered as \u00a0a shot into the muscle before the newborn is discharged from the hospital. An additional two doses should be administered before the child is 18 months.\nFor babies born to a mother with hepatitis B surface antigen positivity, the first dose is unique \u2013 in addition to the vaccine, the hepatitis immune globulin should also be administered, both within 12 hours of birth. \u00a0These newborns should also be regularly tested for infection for at least the first year of life.\nThere is also a combination formulation that includes both hepatitis A and B vaccines.\nOther.\nThere are currently no vaccines available in the United States for hepatitis C or E. In 2015, a group in China published an article regarding the development of a vaccine for hepatitis E. As of March 2016, the United States government was in the process of recruiting participants for the phase IV trial of the hepatitis E vaccine.\nBehavioral changes.\nHepatitis A.\nBecause hepatitis A is transmitted primarily through the oral-fecal route, the mainstay of prevention aside from vaccination is good hygiene, access to clean water and proper handling of sewage.\nHepatitis B and C.\nAs hepatitis B and C are transmitted through blood and multiple bodily fluids, prevention is aimed at screening blood prior to transfusion, abstaining from the use of injection drugs, safe needle and sharps practices in healthcare settings, and safe sex practices.\nHepatitis D.\nThe hepatitis D virus requires that a person first be infected with hepatitis B virus, so prevention efforts should focus on limiting the spread of hepatitis B. In people who have chronic hepatitis B infection and are at risk for superinfection with the hepatitis D virus, the preventive strategies are the same as for hepatitis B.\nHepatitis E.\nHepatitis E is spread primarily through the oral-fecal route but may also be spread by blood and from mother to fetus. The mainstay of hepatitis E prevention is similar to that for hepatitis A (namely, good hygiene and clean water practices).\nAlcoholic and metabolic hepatitis.\nAs excessive alcohol consumption can lead to hepatitis and cirrhosis, the following are maximal recommendations for alcohol consumption:\nTo prevent MAFLD it is recommended to maintain a normal weight, eat a healthy diet, avoid added sugar, and exercise regularly.\nSuccesses.\nHepatitis A.\nIn the United States, universal immunization has led to a two-thirds decrease in hospital admissions and medical expenses due to hepatitis A.\nHepatitis B.\nIn the United States new cases of hepatitis B decreased 75% from 1990 to 2004. \u00a0The group that saw the greatest decrease was children and adolescents, likely reflecting the implementation of the 1999 guidelines.\nHepatitis C.\nHepatitis C infections each year had been declining since the 1980s, but began to increase again in 2006. The data are unclear as to whether the decline can be attributed to needle exchange programmes.\nAlcoholic hepatitis.\nBecause people with alcoholic hepatitis may have no symptoms, it can be difficult to diagnose and the number of people with the disease is probably higher than many estimates. Programs such as Alcoholics Anonymous have been successful in decreasing death due to cirrhosis, but it is difficult to evaluate their success in decreasing the incidence of alcoholic hepatitis.\nTreatment.\nThe treatment of hepatitis varies according to the type, whether it is acute or chronic, and the severity of the disease.\nHepatitis A.\nHepatitis A usually does not progress to a chronic state, and rarely requires hospitalization. Treatment is supportive and includes such measures as providing intravenous (IV) hydration and maintaining adequate nutrition.\nRarely, people with the hepatitis A virus can rapidly develop liver failure, termed \"fulminant hepatic failure\", especially the elderly and those who had a pre-existing liver disease, especially hepatitis C. Mortality risk factors include greater age and chronic hepatitis C. In these cases, more aggressive supportive therapy and liver transplant may be necessary.\nHepatitis B.\nAcute.\nIn healthy patients, 95\u201399% recover with no long-lasting effects, and antiviral treatment is not warranted. Age and comorbid conditions can result in a more prolonged and severe illness. Certain patients warrant hospitalization, especially those who present with clinical signs of ascites, peripheral edema, and hepatic encephalopathy, and laboratory signs of hypoglycemia, prolonged prothrombin time, low serum albumin, and very high serum bilirubin.\nIn these rare, more severe acute cases, patients have been successfully treated with antiviral therapy similar to that used in cases of chronic hepatitis B, with nucleoside analogues such as entecavir or tenofovir. As there is a dearth of clinical trial data and the drugs used to treat are prone to developing resistance, experts recommend reserving treatment for severe acute cases, not mild to moderate.\nChronic.\nChronic hepatitis B management aims to control viral replication, which is correlated with progression of disease. Seven drugs are approved in the United States:\nFirst-line treatments currently used include PEG IFN, entecavir, and tenofovir, subject to patient and physician preference. Treatment initiation is guided by recommendations issued by The American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) and the European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL) and is based on detectable viral levels, HBeAg positive or negative status, ALT levels, and in certain cases, family history of HCC and liver biopsy. In patients with compensated cirrhosis, treatment is recommended regardless of HBeAg status or ALT level, but recommendations differ regarding HBV DNA levels; AASLD recommends treating at DNA levels detectable above 2x103 IU/mL; EASL and WHO recommend treating when HBV DNA levels are detectable at any level. In patients with decompensated cirrhosis, treatment and evaluation for liver transplantation are recommended in all cases if HBV DNA is detectable. Currently, multidrug treatment is not recommended in treatment of chronic HBV as it is no more effective in the long term than individual treatment with entecavir or tenofovir.\nHepatitis C.\nThe American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases and the Infectious Diseases Society of America (AASLD-IDSA) recommend antiviral treatment for all patients with chronic hepatitis C infection except for those with additional chronic medical conditions that limit their life expectancy.\nOnce it is acquired, persistence of the hepatitis C virus is the rule, resulting in chronic hepatitis C. The goal of treatment is prevention of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The best way to reduce the long-term risk of HCC is to achieve sustained virological response (SVR). SVR is defined as an undetectable viral load at 12 weeks after treatment completion and indicates a cure. Currently available treatments include indirect and direct acting antiviral drugs. The indirect acting antivirals include pegylated interferon (PEG IFN) and ribavirin (RBV), which in combination have historically been the basis of therapy for HCV. Duration of and response to these treatments varies based on genotype. These agents are poorly tolerated but are still used in some resource-poor areas. In high-resource countries, they have been supplanted by direct acting antiviral agents, which first appeared in 2011; these agents target proteins responsible for viral replication and include the following three classes:\nThese drugs are used in various combinations, sometimes combined with ribavirin, based on the patient's genotype, delineated as genotypes 1\u20136. Genotype 1 (GT1), which is the most prevalent genotype in the United States and around the world, can now be cured with a direct acting antiviral regimen. First-line therapy for GT1 is a combination of sofosbuvir and ledipasvir (SOF/LDV) for 12 weeks for most patients, including those with advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis. Certain patients with early disease need only 8 weeks of treatment while those with advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis who have not responded to prior treatment require 24 weeks. Cost remains a major factor limiting access to these drugs, particularly in low-resource nations; the cost of the 12-week GT1 regimen (SOF/LDV) has been estimated at US$94,500.\nHepatitis D.\nHepatitis D is difficult to treat, and effective treatments are lacking. Interferon alpha has proven effective at inhibiting viral activity but only on a temporary basis.\nHepatitis E.\nSimilar to hepatitis A, treatment of hepatitis E is supportive and includes rest and ensuring adequate nutrition and hydration. Hospitalization may be required for particularly severe cases or for pregnant women.\nAlcoholic hepatitis.\nFirst-line treatment of alcoholic hepatitis is treatment of alcoholism. For those who abstain completely from alcohol (teetotal), reversal of liver disease and a longer life are possible; patients at every disease stage have been shown to benefit by prevention of additional liver injury. In addition to referral to psychotherapy and other treatment programs, treatment should include nutritional and psychosocial evaluation and treatment. Patients should also be treated appropriately for related signs and symptoms, such as ascites, hepatic encephalopathy, and infection.\nSevere alcoholic hepatitis has a poor prognosis and is notoriously difficult to treat. Without any treatment, 20\u201350% of patients may die within a month, but evidence shows treatment may extend life beyond one month (i.e., reduce short-term mortality). Available treatment options include pentoxifylline (PTX), which is a nonspecific TNF inhibitor, corticosteroids, such as prednisone or prednisolone (CS), corticosteroids with \"N\"-acetylcysteine (CS with NAC), and corticosteroids with pentoxifylline (CS with PTX). Data suggest that CS alone or CS with NAC are most effective at reducing short-term mortality. Unfortunately, corticosteroids are contraindicated in some patients, such as those who have active gastrointestinal bleeding, infection, kidney failure, or pancreatitis. In these cases PTX may be considered on a case-by-case basis in lieu of CS; some evidence shows PTX is better than no treatment at all and may be comparable to CS while other data show no evidence of benefit over placebo. Unfortunately, there are currently no drug treatments that decrease these patients' risk of dying in the longer term, at 3\u201312 months and beyond.\nWeak evidence suggests milk thistle extracts may improve survival in alcoholic liver disease and improve certain liver tests (serum bilirubin and GGT) without causing side effects, but a firm recommendation cannot be made for or against milk thistle without further study.\u00a0\nThe modified Maddrey's discriminant function may be used to evaluate the severity and prognosis in alcoholic hepatitis and evaluates the efficacy of using alcoholic hepatitis corticosteroid treatment.\nMetabolic hepatitis.\nThe main treatment of NASH is gradual weight loss and increased physical activity. In the United States, no medications have been approved to treat this disease.\nAutoimmune hepatitis.\nAutoimmune hepatitis is commonly treated by immunosuppressants such as the corticosteroids prednisone or prednisolone, the active version of prednisolone that does not require liver synthesis, either alone or in combination with azathioprine, and some have suggested the combination therapy is preferred to allow for lower doses of corticosteroids to reduce associated side effects, although the result of treatment efficacy is comparative.\nTreatment of autoimmune hepatitis consists of two phases; an initial and maintenance phase. The initial phase consists of higher doses of corticosteroids which are tapered down over a number of weeks to a lower dose. If used in combination, azathioprine is given during the initial phase as well. Once the initial phase has been completed, a maintenance phase that consists of lower dose corticosteroids, and in combination therapy, azathioprine until liver blood markers are normalized. Treatment results in 66\u201391% of patients achieving normal liver test values in two years, with the average being 22 months.\nPrognosis.\nAcute hepatitis.\nNearly all patients with hepatitis A infections recover completely without complications if they were healthy prior to the infection. Similarly, acute hepatitis B infections have a favorable course towards complete recovery in 95\u201399% of patients. Certain factors may portend a poorer outcome, such as co-morbid medical conditions or initial presenting symptoms of ascites, edema, or encephalopathy. Overall, the mortality rate for acute hepatitis is low: ~0.1% in total for cases of hepatitis A and B, but rates can be higher in certain populations (super infection with both hepatitis B and D, pregnant women, etc.).\nIn contrast to hepatitis A &amp; B, hepatitis C carries a much higher risk of progressing to chronic hepatitis, approaching 85\u201390%. Cirrhosis has been reported to develop in 20\u201350% of patients with chronic hepatitis C.\nOther rare complications of acute hepatitis include pancreatitis, aplastic anemia, peripheral neuropathy, and myocarditis.\nFulminant hepatitis.\nDespite the relatively benign course of most viral cases of hepatitis, fulminant hepatitis represents a rare but feared complication. Fulminant hepatitis most commonly occurs in hepatitis B, D, and E. About 1\u20132% of cases of hepatitis E can lead to fulminant hepatitis, but pregnant women are particularly susceptible, occurring in up to 20% of cases. Mortality rates in cases of fulminant hepatitis rise over 80%, but those patients that do survive often make a complete recovery. Liver transplantation can be life-saving in patients with fulminant liver failure.\nHepatitis D infections can transform benign cases of hepatitis B into severe, progressive hepatitis, a phenomenon known as superinfection.\nChronic hepatitis.\nAcute hepatitis B infections become less likely to progress to chronic forms as the age of the patient increases, with rates of progression approaching 90% in vertically transmitted cases of infants compared to 1% risk in young adults. Overall, the five-year survival rate for chronic hepatitis B ranges from 97% in mild cases to 55% in severe cases with cirrhosis.\nMost patients who acquire hepatitis D at the same time as hepatitis B (co-infection) recover without developing a chronic infection. In people with hepatitis B who later acquire hepatitis D (superinfection), chronic infection is much more common at 80\u201390%, and liver disease progression is accelerated.\nChronic hepatitis C progresses towards cirrhosis, with estimates of cirrhosis prevalence of 16% at 20 years after infection. While the major causes of mortality in hepatitis C is end stage liver disease, hepatocellular carcinoma is an important additional long term complication and cause of death in chronic hepatitis.\nRates of mortality increase with progression of the underlying liver disease. Series of patients with compensated cirrhosis due to HCV have shown 3,5, and 10-year survival rates of 96, 91, and 79% respectively. The 5-year survival rate drops to 50% upon if the cirrhosis becomes decompensated.\nEpidemiology.\nViral hepatitis.\nHepatitis A.\nHepatitis A is found throughout the world and manifests as large outbreaks and epidemics associated with fecal contamination of water and food sources. Hepatitis A viral infection is predominant in children ages 5\u201314 with rare infection of infants. Infected children have little to no apparent clinical illness, in contrast to adults in whom greater than 80% are symptomatic if infected. Infection rates are highest in low resource countries with inadequate public sanitation and large concentrated populations. In such regions, as much as 90% of children younger than 10 years old have been infected and are immune, corresponding both to lower rates of clinically symptomatic disease and outbreaks. The availability of a childhood vaccine has significantly reduced infections in the United States, with incidence declining by more than 95% as of 2013. Paradoxically, the highest rates of new infection now occur in young adults and adults who present with worse clinical illness. Specific populations at greatest risk include: travelers to endemic regions, men who have sex with men, those with occupational exposure to non-human primates, people with clotting disorders who have received clotting factors, people with history of chronic liver disease in whom co-infection with hepatitis A can lead to fulminant hepatitis, and intravenous drug users (rare).\nHepatitis B.\nHepatitis B is the most common cause of viral hepatitis in the world with more than 240 million chronic carriers of the virus, 1 million of whom are in the United States. In approximately two-thirds of patients who develop acute hepatitis B infection, no identifiable exposure is evident. Of those acutely infected, 25% become lifetime carriers of the virus. Risk of infection is highest among intravenous drug users, people with high-risk sexual behaviors, healthcare workers, people who had multiple transfusions, organ transplant patients, dialysis patients and newborns infected during the birthing process. Close to 780,000 deaths in the world are attributed to hepatitis B. The most endemic regions are in sub-Saharan Africa and East Asia, where as many as 10% of adults are chronic carriers. Carrier rates in developed nations are significantly lower, encompassing less than 1% of the population. In endemic regions, transmission is thought to be associated with exposure during birth and close contact between young infants.\nHepatitis C.\nChronic hepatitis C is a major cause of liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. It is a common medical reason for liver transplantation due to its severe complications. It is estimated that 130\u2013180 million people in the world are affected by this disease representing a little more than 3% of the world population. In the developing regions of Africa, Asia and South America, prevalence can be as high as 10% of the population. In Egypt, rates of hepatitis C infection as high as 20% have been documented and are associated with iatrogenic contamination related to schistosomiasis treatment in the 1950s\u20131980s. Currently in the United States, approximately 3.5 million adults are estimated to be infected. Hepatitis C is particularly prevalent among people born between 1945 and 1965, a group of about 800,000 people, with prevalence as high as 3.2% versus 1.6% in the general U.S. population. Most chronic carriers of hepatitis C are unaware of their infection status. The most common mode of transmission of hepatitis C virus is exposure to blood products via blood transfusions (prior to 1992) and intravenous drug injection. A history of intravenous drug injection is the most important risk factor for chronic hepatitis C. Other susceptible populations include those engaged in high-risk sexual behavior, infants of infected mothers, and healthcare workers.\nHepatitis D.\nThe hepatitis D virus causes chronic and fulminant hepatitis in the context of co-infection with the hepatitis B virus. It is primarily transmitted via non-sexual contact and via needles. Susceptibility to hepatitis D differs by geographic region. In the United States and Northern Europe, populations at risk are intravenous drug users and people who receive multiple transfusions. In the Mediterranean, hepatitis D is predominant among hepatitis B virus co-infected people.\nHepatitis E.\nSimilar to Hepatitis A, hepatitis E manifests as large outbreaks and epidemics associated with fecal contamination of water sources. It accounts for more than 55,000 deaths annually with approximately 20 million people worldwide thought to be infected with the virus. It affects predominantly young adults, causing acute hepatitis. In infected pregnant women, Hepatitis E infection can lead to fulminant hepatitis with third trimester mortality rates as high as 30%. Those with weakened immune systems, such as organ transplant recipients, are also susceptible. Infection is rare in the United States but rates are high in the developing world (Africa, Asia, Central America, Middle East). Many genotypes exist and are differentially distributed around the world. There is some evidence of hepatitis E infection of animals, serving as a reservoir for human infection.\nAlcoholic hepatitis.\nAlcoholic hepatitis (AH) in its severe form has a one-month mortality as high as 50%. Most people who develop AH are men but women are at higher risk of developing AH and its complications likely secondary to high body fat and differences in alcohol metabolism. Other contributing factors include younger age &lt;60, binge pattern drinking, poor nutritional status, obesity and hepatitis C co-infection. It is estimated that as much as 20% of people with AH are also infected with hepatitis C. In this population, the presence of hepatitis C virus leads to more severe disease with faster progression to cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma and increased mortality. Obesity increases the likelihood of progression to cirrhosis in cases of alcoholic hepatitis. It is estimated that 70% of people who have AH will progress to cirrhosis.\nNon-alcoholic steatohepatitis.\nNon-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is projected to become the top reason for liver transplantation in the United States by 2020, supplanting chronic liver disease due to hepatitis C. About 20\u201345% of the U.S. population have NAFLD and 6% have NASH. The estimated prevalence of NASH in the world is 3\u20135%. Of NASH patients who develop cirrhosis, about 2% per year will likely progress to hepatocellular carcinoma. Worldwide, the estimated prevalence of hepatocellular carcinoma related to NAFLD is 15\u201330%. NASH is thought to be the primary cause of cirrhosis in approximately 25% of patients in the United States, representing 1\u20132% of the general population.\nHistory.\nEarly observations.\nInitial accounts of a syndrome that is now considered to be hepatitis began to occur around 3000 B.C. Clay tablets that served as medical handbooks for the ancient Sumerians described the first observations of jaundice. The Sumerians believed that the liver was the home of the soul, and attributed the findings of jaundice to the attack of the liver by a devil named Ahhazu.\nAround 400 B.C., Hippocrates recorded the first documentation of an epidemic jaundice, in particular noting the uniquely fulminant course of a cohort of patients who all died within two weeks. He wrote, \"The bile contained in the liver is full of phlegm and blood, and erupts...After such an eruption, the patient soon raves, becomes angry, talks nonsense and barks like a dog.\"\nGiven the poor sanitary conditions of war, infectious jaundice played a large role as a major cause of mortality among troops in the Napoleonic Wars, the American Revolutionary War, and both World Wars. During World War II, estimates of soldiers affected by hepatitis were upwards of 10 million.\nDuring World War II, soldiers received vaccines against diseases such as yellow fever, but these vaccines were stabilized with human serum, presumably contaminated with hepatitis viruses, which often created epidemics of hepatitis. It was suspected these epidemics were due to a separate infectious agent, and not due to the yellow fever virus itself, after noting 89 cases of jaundice in the months after vaccination out of a total 3,100 patients that were vaccinated. After changing the seed virus strain, no cases of jaundice were observed in the subsequent 8,000 vaccinations.\nWillowbrook State School experiments.\nA New York University researcher named Saul Krugman continued this research into the 1950s and 1960s, most infamously with his experiments on mentally disabled children at the Willowbrook State School in New York, a crowded urban facility where hepatitis infections were highly endemic to the student body. Krugman injected students with gamma globulin, a type of antibody. After observing the temporary protection against infection this antibody provided, he then tried injected live hepatitis virus into students. Krugman also controversially took feces from infected students, blended it into milkshakes, and fed it to newly admitted children.\nHis research was received with much controversy, as people protested the questionable ethics surrounding the chosen target population. Henry Beecher was one of the foremost critics in an article in the \"New England Journal of Medicine\" in 1966, arguing that parents were unaware to the risks of consent and that the research was done to benefit others at the expense of children. Moreover, he argued that poor families with mentally disabled children often felt pressured to join the research project to gain admission to the school, with all of the educational and support resources that would come along with it. Others in the medical community spoke out in support of Krugman's research in terms of its widespread benefits and understanding of the hepatitis virus, and Willowbrook continues to be a commonly cited example in debates about medical ethics.\nAustralia antigen.\nThe next insight regarding hepatitis B was a serendipitous one by Dr. Baruch Blumberg, a researcher at the NIH who did not set out to research hepatitis, but rather studied lipoprotein genetics. He travelled across the globe collecting blood samples, investigating the interplay between disease, environment, and genetics with the goal of designing targeted interventions for at-risk people that could prevent them from getting sick. He noticed an unexpected interaction between the blood of a patient with hemophilia that had received multiple transfusions and a protein found in the blood of an indigenous Australian person. He named the protein the \"Australia antigen\" and made it the focus of his research. He found a higher prevalence of the protein in the blood of patients from developing countries, compared to those from developed ones, and noted associations of the antigen with other diseases like leukemia and Down Syndrome. Eventually, he came to the unifying conclusion that the Australia antigen was associated with viral hepatitis.\nIn 1970, David Dane first isolated the hepatitis B virion at London's Middlesex Hospital, and named the virion the 42-nm \"Dane particle\". Based on its association with the surface of the hepatitis B virus, the Australia antigen was renamed to \"hepatitis B surface antigen\" or HBsAg.\nBlumberg continued to study the antigen, and eventually developed the first hepatitis B vaccine using plasma rich in HBsAg, for which he received the Nobel Prize in Medicine in 1976.\nSociety and culture.\nEconomic burden.\nOverall, hepatitis accounts for a significant portion of healthcare expenditures in both developing and developed nations, and is expected to rise in several developing countries. While hepatitis A infections are self-limited events, they are associated with significant costs in the United States. It has been estimated that direct and indirect costs are approximately $1817 and $2459 respectively per case, and that an average of 27 work days is lost per infected adult. A 1997 report demonstrated that a single hospitalization related to hepatitis A cost an average of $6,900 and resulted in around $500 million in total annual healthcare costs. Cost effectiveness studies have found widespread vaccination of adults to not be feasible, but have stated that a combination hepatitis A and B vaccination of children and at risk groups (people from endemic areas, healthcare workers) may be.\nHepatitis B accounts for a much larger percentage of health care spending in endemic regions like Asia. In 1997 it accounted for 3.2% of South Korea's total health care expenditures and resulted in $696 million in direct costs. A large majority of that sum was spent on treating disease symptoms and complications. Chronic hepatitis B infections are not as endemic in the United States, but accounted for $357 million in hospitalization costs in the year 1990. That number grew to $1.5 billion in 2003, but remained stable as of 2006, which may be attributable to the introduction of effective drug therapies and vaccination campaigns.\nPeople infected with chronic hepatitis C tend to be frequent users of the health care system globally. It has been estimated that a person infected with hepatitis C in the United States will result in a monthly cost of $691. That number nearly doubles to $1,227 for people with compensated (stable) cirrhosis, while the monthly cost of people with decompensated (worsening) cirrhosis is almost five times as large at $3,682. The wide-ranging effects of hepatitis make it difficult to estimate indirect costs, but studies have speculated that the total cost is $6.5 billion annually in the United States. In Canada, 56% of HCV related costs are attributable to cirrhosis and total expenditures related to the virus are expected to peak at CAD$396 million in the year 2032.\n2003 Monaca outbreak.\nThe largest outbreak of hepatitis A virus in United States history occurred among people who ate at a now-defunct Mexican food restaurant located in Monaca, Pennsylvania in late 2003. Over 550 people who visited the restaurant between September and October 2003 were infected with the virus, three of whom died as a direct result. The outbreak was brought to the attention of health officials when local emergency medicine physicians noticed a significant increase in cases of hepatitis A in the county. After conducting its investigation, the CDC attributed the source of the outbreak to the use of contaminated raw green onion. The restaurant was purchasing its green onion stock from farms in Mexico at the time. It is believed that the green onions may have been contaminated through the use of contaminated water for crop irrigation, rinsing, or icing or by handling of the vegetables by infected people. Green onion had caused similar outbreaks of hepatitis A in the southern United States prior to this, but not to the same magnitude. The CDC believes that the restaurant's use of a large communal bucket for chopped raw green onion allowed non-contaminated plants to be mixed with contaminated ones, increasing the number of vectors of infection and amplifying the outbreak. The restaurant was closed once it was discovered to be the source, and over 9,000 people were given hepatitis A immune globulin because they had either eaten at the restaurant or had been in close contact with someone who had.\nSpecial populations.\nHIV co-infection.\nPersons infected with HIV have a particularly high burden of HIV-HCV co-infection. In a recent study by the WHO, the likelihood of being infected with hepatitis C virus was six times greater in those who also had HIV. The prevalence of HIV-HCV co-infection worldwide was estimated to be 6.2% representing more than 2.2 million people. Intravenous drug use was an independent risk factor for HCV infection. In the WHO study, the prevalence of HIV-HCV co-infection was markedly higher at 82.4% in those who injected drugs compared to the general population (2.4%). In a study of HIV-HCV co-infection among HIV positive men who have sex with men (MSM), the overall prevalence of anti-hepatitis C antibodies was estimated to be 8.1% and increased to 40% among HIV positive MSM who also injected drugs.\nPregnancy.\nHepatitis B.\nVertical transmission is a significant contributor of new HBV cases each year, with 35\u201350% of transmission from mother to neonate in endemic countries. Vertical transmission occurs largely via a neonate's exposure to maternal blood and vaginal secretions during birth. While the risk of progression to chronic infection is approximately 5% among adults who contract the virus, it is as high as 95% among neonates subject to vertical transmission. The risk of viral transmission is approximately 10\u201320% when maternal blood is positive for HBsAg, and up to 90% when also positive for HBeAg.\nGiven the high risk of perinatal transmission, the CDC recommends screening all pregnant women for HBV at their first prenatal visit. It is safe for non-immune pregnant women to receive the HBV vaccine. Based on the limited available evidence, the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) recommends antiviral therapy in pregnant women whose viral load exceeds 200,000 IU/mL. A growing body of evidence shows that antiviral therapy initiated in the third trimester significantly reduces transmission to the neonate. A systematic review of the Antiretroviral Pregnancy Registry database found that there was no increased risk of congenital anomalies with Tenofovir; for this reason, along with its potency and low risk of resistance, the AASLD recommends this drug. A 2010 systematic review and meta-analysis found that Lamivudine initiated early in the third trimester also significantly reduced mother-to-child transmission of HBV, without any known adverse effects.\nThe ACOG states that the evidence available does not suggest any particular mode of delivery (i.e. vaginal vs. cesarean) is better at reducing vertical transmission in mothers with HBV.\nThe WHO and CDC recommend that neonates born to mothers with HBV should receive hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG) as well as the HBV vaccine within 12 hours of birth. For infants who have received HBIG and the HBV vaccine, breastfeeding is safe.\nHepatitis C.\nEstimates of the rate of HCV vertical transmission range from 2\u20138%; a 2014 systematic review and meta-analysis found the risk to be 5.8% in HCV-positive, HIV-negative women. The same study found the risk of vertical transmission to be 10.8% in HCV-positive, HIV-positive women. Other studies have found the risk of vertical transmission to be as high as 44% among HIV-positive women. The risk of vertical transmission is higher when the virus is detectable in the mother's blood.\nEvidence does not indicate that mode of delivery (i.e. vaginal vs. cesarean) has an effect on vertical transmission.\nFor women who are HCV-positive and HIV-negative, breastfeeding is safe. CDC guidelines suggest avoiding it if a woman's nipples are cracked or bleeding to reduce the risk of transmission.\nHepatitis E.\nPregnant women who contract HEV are at significant risk of developing fulminant hepatitis with maternal mortality rates as high as 20\u201330%, most commonly in the third trimester . A 2016 systematic review and meta-analysis of 47 studies that included 3968 people found maternal case-fatality rates (CFR) of 20.8% and fetal CFR of 34.2%; among women who developed fulminant hepatic failure, CFR was 61.2%.\nVaccine.\nAn essential defense against hepatitis infections, especially those caused by Hepatitis A and B, is the hepatitis vaccination. The Hepatitis B vaccination is quite effective and frequently used. The frequency of hepatitis-related liver illnesses and fatalities has been considerably decreased by the immunization campaigns.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Lofting settled in the United States soon after the war and before his first book was published.\nPersonal life.\nLofting was born on 14 January 1886 in Maidenhead, Berkshire, to Elizabeth Agnes (Gannon) and John Brien Lofting, and was of English and Irish ancestry. His eldest brother, Hilary Lofting, later became a novelist in Australia, having emigrated there in 1915.\nLofting was educated at Mount St Mary's College in Spinkhill, Derbyshire. From 1905 to 1906 he studied civil engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, Massachusetts.\nLofting travelled widely as a civil engineer before enlisting in the Irish Guards regiment of the British Army in the First World War. Not wishing to write to his children about the brutal war, he wrote imaginative letters that later became the foundations for his \"Doctor Dolittle\" novels for children. Seriously wounded in the war, he emigrated with his family to Killingworth, Connecticut, in 1919. He was married three times and had three children, one of whom, his son Christopher, became the executor of his literary estate.\nLofting died on 26 September 1947 at his home in Topanga, California from cirrhosis of the liver. He is buried at Evergreen Cemetery in Killingworth, Middlesex County, Connecticut.\nDoctor Dolittle.\nHugh Lofting's character Doctor John Dolittle, an English physician who lives in the fictional town of Puddleby-on-the-Marsh in the West Country and can speak to animals, first saw light in illustrated letters written to his children from the trenches, when actual news, he later said, was too horrible or too dull. The stories are set in England in the 1820s\u20131840s \u2013 \"The Voyages of Doctor Dolittle\" gives a date of 1839.\n\"The Story of Doctor Dolittle: Being the History of His Peculiar Life at Home and Astonishing Adventures in Foreign Parts Never Before Printed\" (1920) began the series and won a posthumous Lewis Carroll Shelf Award in 1958. Its first sequel, \"The Voyages of Doctor Dolittle\" (1922) won a Newbery Medal. Eight novels completed by Lofting followed and two more books were edited after his death.\nOther works for children.\n\"The Story of Mrs Tubbs\" (1923) and \"Tommy, Tilly, and Mrs. Tubbs\" (1936) are picture books aimed at a younger audience than the Doctor Dolittle books. They tell of the old woman and her pets, with whom she can speak, and the animals who help her out of trouble.\n\"Porridge Poetry\" (1924) is the only non-Dolittle work by Lofting still in print. It is a colourfully illustrated book of lighthearted poems for children.\n\"Noisy Nora\" (1929) is a cautionary tale about a girl who is a noisy eater. The book is printed as if handwritten, and the many illustrations often merge with the text.\n\"The Twilight of Magic\" (1930) is aimed at older readers. It is set in an age when magic is dying and science is beginning. This work is the only one of Lofting's books to have been illustrated by another person: Lois Lenski.\n\"Victory for the Slain\".\n\"Victory for the Slain\" (1942), Lofting's only work for adults, consists of a single long poem in seven parts about the futility of war, permeated by the refrain \"In war the only victors are the slain\". It appeared only in the United Kingdom.\nPublished books.\nLofting commented: \"For years it was a constant source of shock to me to find my writings amongst 'juveniles'. It does not bother me any more now, but I still feel there should be a category of 'seniles' to offset the epithet.\"\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
