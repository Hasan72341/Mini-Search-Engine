The word \"theft\" is also used as a synonym or informal shorthand term for some crimes against property, such as larceny, robbery[heist], embezzlement, extortion, blackmail, or receiving stolen property. In some jurisdictions, \"theft\" is considered to be synonymous with \"larceny\", while in others, \"theft\" is defined more narrowly. A person who engages in theft is known as a thief (pl. thieves).\n\"Theft\" is the name of a statutory offence in California, Canada, England and Wales, Hong Kong, Northern Ireland, the Republic of Ireland, and the Australian states of South Australia and Victoria.\nElements.\nThe \"actus reus\" of theft is usually defined as an unauthorised taking, keeping, or using of another's property which must be accompanied by a \"mens rea\" of dishonesty and the intent to permanently deprive the owner or rightful possessor of that property or its use.\nFor example, if X goes to a restaurant and, by mistake, takes Y's scarf instead of her own, she has physically deprived Y of the use of the property (which is the \"actus reus\") but the mistake prevents X from forming the \"mens rea\" (i.e., because she believes that she is the owner, she is not dishonest and does not intend to deprive the \"owner\" of it) so no crime has been committed at this point. But if she realises the mistake when she gets home and could return the scarf to Y, she will steal the scarf if she dishonestly keeps it (see theft by finding). Note that there may be civil liability for the torts of trespass to chattels or conversion in either eventuality.\nPsychology.\nPossible causes for acts of theft include both economic and non-economic motivations. For example, an act of theft may be a response to the offender's feelings of anger, grief, depression, anxiety, compulsion, boredom, power and control issues, low self-esteem, a sense of entitlement, an effort to conform or fit in with a peer group, or rebellion. Theft from work may be attributed to factors that include greed, perceptions of economic need, support of a drug addiction, a response to or revenge for work-related issues, rationalisation that the act is not actually one of stealing, response to opportunistic temptation, or the same emotional issues that may be involved in any other act of theft. Grotius and Pufendorf upheld the principle that a person in extreme and unavoidable need, who took from the surpluses of property holders, was not guilty of the crime of theft.\nThe most common reasons for shoplifting include participation in an organised shoplifting ring, opportunistic theft, compulsive acts of theft, thrill-seeking, and theft due to need. Studies focusing on shoplifting by teenagers suggest that minors shoplift for reasons including the novelty of the experience, peer pressure, the desire to obtain goods that a minor cannot legally purchase, and for economic reasons, as well as self-indulgence and rebellion against parents.\nReligious views.\nBuddhism.\nIn Buddhism, one of the five precepts prohibits theft, and involves the intention to steal what one perceives as not belonging to oneself (\"what is not given\") and acting successfully upon that intention. The severity of the act of theft is judged by the worth of the owner and the worth of that which is stolen. Underhand dealings, fraud, cheating and forgery are also included in this precept. Professions that are seen to violate the precept against theft are working in the gambling industry or marketing products that are not actually required for the customer.\nHinduism.\nThe Manusmriti and the Dharmashastras deal with theft, coveting wealth, and punishment for these.\nIslam.\nIn parts of the world which govern with sharia law, the punishment for theft is amputation of the right hand if the thief does not repent. This ruling is derived from surah 5 verse 38 of the Quran which states \"As to the thief, Male or female, cut off his or her hands: a punishment by way of example, from Allah, for their crime: and Allah is Exalted in power.\" This is viewed as being a deterrent.\nJudaism and Christianity.\nTwo of the Ten Commandments prohibit acts of theft. The New Testament describes Jesus of Nazareth affirming these in his teachings.\nBy jurisdiction.\nAustralia.\nActus reus.\nSouth Australia\nTheft is defined in section 134 of the \"Criminal Consolidation Act\" 1935 (SA) as being where a person deals with property dishonestly, without the owner's consent and intending to deprive the owner of their property, or make a serious encroachment on the proprietary rights of the owner.\nUnder this law, encroachment on proprietary rights means that the property is dealt with in a way that creates a substantial risk that the property will not be returned to the owner, or that the value of the property will be greatly diminished when the owner does get it back. Also, where property is treated as the defendant's own property to dispose of, disregarding the actual property owner's rights.\nFor a basic offence, a person found guilty of this offence is liable for imprisonment of up to 10 years.\nFor an aggravated offence, a person found guilty of this offence is liable for imprisonment of up to 15 years.\nVictoria\nTheft is defined in the \"Crimes Act\" 1958 (Vic) as when a person \"dishonestly appropriates property belonging to another with the intention of permanently depriving the other of it.\". The actus reus and mens rea are defined as follows:\nAppropriation is defined in section 73(4) of the \"Crimes Act\" 1958 (Vic) as the assumption of any of the owner's rights. It does not have to be all the owner's rights, as long as at least one right has been assumed. If the owner gave their consent to the appropriation there cannot be an appropriation. However, if this consent is obtained by deception, this consent is vitiated.\nProperty \u2013 defined in section 71(1) of the \"Crimes Act\" 1958 (Vic) as being both tangible property, including money and intangible property. Information has been held not be property.\nBelonging to another \u2013 section 73(5) of the \"Crimes Act\" 1958 (Vic) provides that property belongs to another if that person has ownership, possession, or a proprietary interest in the property. Property can belong to more than one person. sections 73(9) &amp; 73(10) deal with situations where the accused receives property under an obligation or by mistake.\nMens rea.\nSouth Australia\nWhether a person's conduct is dishonest is a question of fact to be determined by the jury, based on their own knowledge and experience. As with the definition in Victoria, it contains definitions of what is not dishonesty, including a belief in a legal claim of right or a belief the owner could not be found.\nVictoria\nIntention to permanently deprive \u2013 defined at s.73(12) as treating property as it belongs to the accused, rather than the owner.\nDishonestly \u2013 section 73(2) of the \"Crimes Act\" 1958 (Vic) creates a negative definition of the term 'dishonestly'. The section deems only three circumstances when the accused is deemed to have been acting honestly. These are a belief in a legal claim of right, a belief that the owner would have consented, or a belief the owner could not be found.\nCanada.\nSection 322(1) of the Criminal Code provides the general definition for theft in Canada:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\n322. (1) Every one commits theft who fraudulently and without colour of right takes, or fraudulently and without colour of right converts to his/her use or to the use of another person, anything, whether animate or inanimate, with intent\n(a) to deprive, temporarily or absolutely, the owner of it, or a person who has a special property or interest in it, of the thing or of his property or interest in it;\n(b) to pledge it or deposit it as security;\n(c) to part with it under a condition with respect to its return that the person who parts with it may be unable to perform; or\n(d) to deal with it in such a manner that it cannot be restored in the condition in which it was at the time it was taken or converted.\nSections 323 to 333 provide for more specific instances and exclusions:\n* theft from oyster beds (s. 323)\n* theft by bailee of things under seizure (s. 324)\n* exception when agent is pledging goods (s. 325)\n* theft of telecommunications service (s. 326)\n* possession of device to obtain telecommunication facility or service (s. 327)\n* theft by or from person having special property or interest (s. 328)\n* theft by person required to account (s. 330)\n* theft by person holding power of attorney (s. 331)\n* misappropriation of money held under direction (s. 332)\n* exception for ore taken for exploration or scientific research (s. 333)\nIn the general definition above, the Supreme Court of Canada has construed \"anything\" very broadly, stating that it is not restricted to tangibles, but includes intangibles. To be the subject of theft it must, however:\n* be property of some sort;\n* be property capable of being\n* taken (therefore intangibles are excluded); or\n* converted (and may be an intangible);\n* taken or converted in a way that deprives the owner of his/her proprietary interest in some way.\nBecause of this, confidential information cannot be the subject of theft, as it is not capable of being taken as only tangibles can be taken. It cannot be converted, not because it is an intangible, but because, save in very exceptional far\u2011fetched circumstances, the owner would never be deprived of it. However, the theft of trade secrets in certain circumstances does constitute part of the offence of economic espionage, which can be prosecuted under s. 19 of the \"Security of Information Act\".\nFor the purposes of punishment, Section 334 divides theft into two separate offences, according to the value and nature of the goods stolen:\n* If the thing stolen is worth more than $5000 or is a testamentary instrument the offence is commonly referred to as Theft Over $5000 and is an indictable offence with a maximum punishment of 10 years imprisonment.\n*Where the stolen item is not a testamentary instrument and is not worth more than $5000 it is known as Theft Under $5000 and is a hybrid offence, meaning that it can be treated either as an indictable offense or a less serious summary conviction offence, depending on the choice of the prosecutor.\n* if dealt with as an indictable offence, it is punishable by imprisonment for not more than 2 years, and,\n* if treated as a summary conviction offence, it is punishable by 6 months imprisonment, a fine of $2000 or both.\nWhere a motor vehicle is stolen, Section 333.1 provides for a maximum punishment of 10 years for an indictable offence (and a minimum sentence of six months for a third or subsequent conviction), and a maximum sentence of 18 months on summary conviction.\nHong Kong.\nSection 2 of the Theft Ordinance provides the general definition of theft in Hong Kong:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThe elements of this offence in Hong Kong is almost the same as in England and Wales, because the Theft Ordinance in Hong Kong was drafted based on the Theft Act 1968 (and the Theft Act 1978) in UK. However, the \"Ghosh Test\" for dishonest in Hong Kong has been replaced by the \"Ivey Test\" in England and Wales by the Supreme Court. It is the main difference between the offence of theft in these two jurisdictions.\nIndia.\nTheft is a criminal activity in India with punishments which may lead to jail term. Below are excerpts of laws of Indian penal Code which state definitions and punishments for theft.\nWhoever intending to take dishonestly any movable property out of the possession of any person without that person\u2019s consent, moves that property in order to such taking is said to commit theft.\nExplanation 1.\u2014A thing so long as it is attached to the earth, not being movable property, is not the subject of theft; but it becomes capable of being the subject of theft as soon as it is severed from the earth.\nExplanation 2.\u2014A moving effected by the same act which effects the severance may be a theft.\nExplanation 3.\u2014A person is said to cause a thing to move by removing an obstacle which prevented it from moving or by separating it from any other thing, as well as by actually moving it.\nExplanation 4.\u2014A person, who by any means causes an animal to move, is said to move that animal, and to move everything which, in consequence of the motion so caused, is moved by that animal.\nExplanation 5.\u2014The consent mentioned in the definition may be express or implied, and may be given either by the person in possession, or by any person having for that purpose authority either express or implied.\nWhoever commits theft shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to three years, or with fine, or with both.\nWhoever commits theft in any building, tent or vessel, which building, tent or vessel is used as a human dwelling, or used for the custody of property, shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to seven years, and shall also be liable to fine.\nWhoever, being a clerk or servant, or being employed in the capacity of a clerk or servant, commits theft in respect of any property in the possession of his master or employer, shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to seven years, and shall also be liable to fine.\nWhoever commits theft, having made preparation for causing death, or hurt, or restraint, or fear of death, or of hurt, or of restraint, to any person, in order to the committing of such theft, or in order to the effecting of his escape after the committing of such theft, or in order to the retaining of property taken by such theft, shall be punished with rigorous imprisonment for a term which may extend to ten years, and shall also be liable to fine.\nThe Netherlands.\nTheft is a crime with related articles in the Wetboek van Strafrecht.\nRepublic of Ireland.\nTheft is a statutory offence, created by section 4(1) of the Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act 2001.\nRomania.\nAccording to the Romanian Penal Code a person committing theft (\"furt\") can face a penalty ranging from 1 to 20 years.\nDegrees of theft:\n*Aggravating circumstances (3 to 15 years): a) by two or more persons together; b) by a person in possession of a gun or a narcotic substance; c) by a masked or disguised person; d) against a person who cannot defend his or herself; e) in a public place; f) in a public transportation vehicle; g) during nighttime; h) during a natural disaster; i) through burglary, or by using an original or copied key; j) stealing national treasures; k) stealing official identity papers with the intention to make use of them; l) stealing official identity badges with the intention to make use of them.\n*Aggravating circumstances (4 to 18 years): a) stealing petrol-based products directly from transportation pipes and vehicles or deposits; b) stealing components from national electrification, telecommunication, irrigation networks or from any type of navigational system; c) stealing a siren; d) stealing a public intervention vehicle or device; e) stealing something which jeopardises the safety of public transportation.\n*Aggravating circumstances (10 to 20 years): when the consequences are extremely grave and affect public institutions or the material stolen is worth over 200,000 RON (approximately US$80,000).\nUnited Kingdom.\nEngland and Wales.\nIn England and Wales, theft is a statutory offence, created by section 1(1) of the Theft Act 1968. This offence replaces the former offences of larceny, embezzlement and fraudulent conversion.\nThe marginal note to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968 describes it as a \"basic definition\" of theft. Sections 1(1) and (2) provide:\n1.-(1) A person is guilty of theft, if he dishonestly appropriates property belonging to another with the intention of permanently depriving the other of it; and \"thief\" and \"steal\" shall be construed accordingly.\n(2) It is immaterial whether the appropriation is made with a view to gain, or is made for the thief\u2019s own benefit.\nSections 2 to 6 of the Theft Act 1968 have effect as regards the interpretation and operation of section 1 of that Act. Except as otherwise provided by that Act, sections 2 to 6 of that Act apply only for the purposes of section 1 of that Act.\nThe offence of theft is typically understood to have 5 elements which must be proved at trial: dishonesty, appropriation, property, belonging to another, intent to permanently deprive.\n1. 'Dishonestly'.\nThere is no theft without dishonesty in English &amp; Welsh criminal law. Reflective of this, s2 of the Theft Act 1968 provides circumstances in which a person is not to be considered dishonest. However the word is not defined in statute.\nThe test of dishonesty is a common law one. It was previously contained in the judgment of \"R v Ghosh\", however this has since been overruled by \"Ivey v Genting Casinos\", as confirmed by \"R v Barton and Booth.\"\n2. 'Appropriates'.\nSection 3 provides:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;(1) Any assumption by a person of the rights of an owner amounts to an appropriation, and this includes, where he has come by the property (innocently or not) without stealing it, any later assumption of a right to it by keeping or dealing with it as owner.\n(2) Where property or a right or interest in property is or purports to be transferred for value to a person acting in good faith, no later assumption by him of rights which he believed himself to be acquiring shall, by reason of any defect in the transferor\u2019s title, amount to theft of the property.\nSee \"R v Hinks\" and \"Lawrence v Metropolitan Police Commissione\"r.\n3. 'Property'.\nSection 4(1) provides that:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"Property\" includes money and all other property, real or personal, including things in action and other intangible property.\nEdward Griew said that section 4(1) could, without changing its meaning, be reduced, by omitting words, to:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"Property\" includes \u2026 all \u2026 property.\nSections 4(2) to (4) provide that the following can only be stolen under certain circumstances:\nIntangible property\nConfidential information and trade secrets are not property within the meaning of section 4.\nThe words \"other intangible property\" include export quotas that are transferable for value on a temporary or permanent basis.\nElectricity\nElectricity cannot be stolen. It is not property within the meaning of section 4 and is not appropriated by switching on a current. \"Cf.\" the offence of abstracting electricity under section 13.\n4. 'Belonging to another'.\nSection 5 \"belonging to another\" requires a distinction to be made between ownership, possession and control:\nSo if A buys a car for cash, A will be the owner. If A then lends the car to B Ltd (a company), B Ltd will have possession. C, an employee of B Ltd then uses the car and has control. If C uses the car in an unauthorised way, C will steal the car from A and B Ltd. This means that it is possible to steal one's own property.\nIn R v Turner, the owner removed his car from the forecourt of a garage where it had been left for collection after repair. He intended to avoid paying the bill. There was an appropriation of the car because it had been physically removed but there were two issues to be decided:\n5. 'With the intention of permanently depriving the other of it'.\nSection 6 \"with the intent to permanently deprive the other of it\" is sufficiently flexible to include situations where the property is later returned.\nAlternative verdict\nThe offense created by section 12(1) of the Theft Act 1968 (TWOC) is available an alternative verdict on an indictment for theft.\nVisiting forces\nTheft is an offence against property for the purposes of section 3 of the Visiting Forces Act 1952.\nMode of trial and sentence\nTheft is triable either way. A person guilty of theft is liable, on conviction on indictment, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding seven years, or on summary conviction to imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months, or to a fine not exceeding the prescribed sum, or to both.\nAggravated theft\nThe only offence of aggravated theft is robbery, contrary to section 8 of the Theft Act 1968.\nStolen goods\nFor the purposes of the provisions of the Theft Act 1968 which relate to stolen goods, goods obtain in England or Wales or elsewhere by blackmail or fraud are regarded as stolen, and the words \"steal\", \"theft\" and \"thief\" are construed accordingly.\nSections 22 to 24 and 26 to 28 of the Theft Act 1968 contain references to stolen goods.\nHandling stolen goods\nThe offence of handling stolen goods, contrary to section 22(1) of the Theft Act 1968, can only be committed \"otherwise than in the course of stealing\".\nSimilar or associated offences\nAccording to its title, the Theft Act 1968 revises the law as to theft and similar or associated offences. See also the Theft Act 1978.\nNorthern Ireland.\nIn Northern Ireland, theft is a statutory offence, created by section 1 of the Theft Act (Northern Ireland) 1969.\nUnited States.\nIn the United States, crimes must be prosecuted in the jurisdiction in which they occurred. Although federal and state jurisdiction may overlap, even when a criminal act violates both state and federal law, in most cases only the most serious offenses are prosecuted at the federal level.\nThe federal government has criminalised certain narrow categories of theft that directly affect federal agencies or interstate commerce. The Model Penal Code, promulgated by the American Law Institute to help state legislatures update and standardise their laws, includes categories of theft by unlawful taking or by unlawfully disposing of property, theft by deception (fraud), theft by extortion, theft by failure to take measures to return lost or mislaid or mistakenly delivered property, theft by receipt of stolen property, theft by failing to make agreed disposition of received funds, and theft of services.\nAlthough many U.S. states have retained larceny as the primary offense, some have now adopted theft provisions.\nGrand theft, also called \"grand larceny\", is a term used throughout the United States designating theft that is large in magnitude or serious in potential penological consequences. Grand theft is contrasted with petty theft, also called petit theft, that is of smaller magnitude or lesser seriousness.\nTheft laws, including the distinction between grand theft and petty theft for cases falling within its jurisdiction, vary by state. This distinction is established by statute, as are the penological consequences. Most commonly, statutes establishing the distinction between grand theft and petty theft do so on the basis of the value of the money or property taken by the thief or lost by the victim, with the dollar threshold for grand theft varying from state to state. Most commonly, the penological consequences of the distinction include the significant one that grand theft can be treated as a felony, while petty theft is generally treated as a misdemeanor.\nIn some states, grand theft of a vehicle may be charged as \"grand theft auto\" (see motor vehicle theft for more information).\nRepeat offenders who continue to steal may become subject to life imprisonment in certain states.\nSometimes the federal anti-theft-of-government-property law \u00a0https:// is used to prosecute cases where the Espionage Act would otherwise be involved, the theory being that by retaining sensitive information, the defendant has taken a 'thing of value' from the government. For examples, see the Amerasia case and \"United States v. Manning\".\nAlabama.\nWhen stolen property exceeds the amount of $500 it is a felony offense. If property is less than $500, then it is a Class A misdemeanor. Unlike some other states, shoplifting is not defined by a separate statute but falls under the state's general theft statute.\nAlaska.\nThe Alaska State Code does not use the terms \"grand theft\" or \"grand larceny\". However, it specifies that theft of property valued at more than $1,000 is a felony whereas thefts of lesser amounts are misdemeanors. The felony categories (class 1 and class 2 theft) also include theft of firearms; property taken from the person of another; vessel or aircraft safety or survival equipment; and of access devices.\nArizona.\nFelony theft is committed when the value of the stolen property exceeds $1000. Regardless of the value of the item, if it is a firearm or an animal taken for the purpose of animal fighting, then the theft is a Class 6 Felony.\nCalifornia.\nThe Theft Act of 1927 consolidated a variety of common law crimes into theft. The state now distinguishes between two types of theft, grand theft and petty theft. The older crimes of embezzlement, larceny, and stealing, and any preexisting references to them now fall under the theft statute.\nThere are a number of criminal statutes in the California Penal Code defining grand theft in different amounts. Grand theft generally consists of the theft of something of value over $950 (including money, labor or property but is lower with respect to various specified property), Theft is also considered grand theft when more than $250 in crops or marine life forms are stolen, \"when the property is taken from the person of another,\" or when the property stolen is an automobile, farm animal, or firearm.\nPetty theft is the default category for all other thefts.\nGrand theft is punishable by up to a year in jail or prison, and may be charged (depending upon the circumstances) as a misdemeanor or felony, while petty theft is a misdemeanor punishable by a fine or imprisonment not exceeding six months in jail or both.\nFlorida.\nIn general, any property taken that carries a value of more than $750 can be considered grand theft in certain circumstances.\nGeorgia.\nIn Georgia, when a theft offense involves property valued at $500 or less, the crime is punishable as a misdemeanor. Any theft of property determined to be exceeding $500 may be treated as grand theft and charged as a felony.\nHawaii.\nTheft in the first or second degree is a felony. Theft in the first degree means theft above $20,000 or of a firearm or explosive; or theft over $300 during a declared emergency. Theft in the second degree means theft above $750, theft from the person of another, or agricultural products over $100 or aquacultural products from an enclosed property.\nIllinois.\nTheft is a felony if the value of the property exceeds $300 or the property is stolen from the person of another. Thresholds at $10,000, $100,000, and $500,000 determine how severe the punishment can be. The location from which property was stolen is also a factor in sentencing.\nKentucky.\nKRS 514.030 states that theft by unlawful taking or disposition is generally a Class A misdemeanor unless the items stolen are a firearm, anhydrous ammonia, a controlled substance valued at less than $10,000 or any other item or combination of items valued $500 or higher and less than $10,000 in which case the theft is a Class D felony. Theft of items valued at $10,000 or higher and less than $1,000,000 is a Class C felony. Theft of items valued at $1,000,000 or more is a Class B felony, as is first offense theft of anhydrous ammonia for the express purpose of manufacturing methamphetamines in violation of KRS 218A.1432. In the latter case, subsequent offenses are a Class A felony.\nMassachusetts.\nIn Massachusetts, theft may generally be charged as a felony if the value of stolen property is greater than $250.\nMissouri.\nStealing is a felony if the value of stolen property exceeds $500. It is also a felony if \"The actor physically takes the property appropriated from the person of the victim\" or the stolen property is a vehicle, legal document, credit card, firearm, explosive, U.S. flag on display, livestock animal, fish with value exceeding $75, captive wildlife, controlled substance, or anhydrous ammonia. Stealing in excess of $25,000 is usually a class B felony (sentence: 5\u201315 years), while any other felony stealing (not including the felonies of burglary or robbery) that does not involve chemicals is a class C felony (sentence: up to 7 years). Non-felony stealing is a class A misdemeanor (sentence: up to 1 year).\nNew York.\nGrand larceny consists of stealing property with a value exceeding $1000; or stealing a public record, secret scientific material, firearm, credit or debit card, ammonia, telephone with service, or motor vehicle or religious item with value exceeding $100; or stealing from the person of another or by extortion or from an ATM. The degree of grand larceny is increased if the theft was from an ATM, through extortion involving fear, or involved a value exceeding the thresholds of $3,000, $50,000, or $1,000,000.\nVermont.\nGrand Larceny:\nValue of goods exceed $900 (13 V.S.A. \u00a7 2501)\nVirginia.\nGrand Larceny:\nValue of goods exceed $1000 (Virginia Code \u00a7 18.2-95)\nWashington State.\nTheft of goods valued between $750 and $5000 is second-degree theft, a Class C felony. Theft of goods valued above $5000, of a search-and-rescue dog on duty, of public records from a public office or official, of metal wire from a utility, or of an access device, is a Class B felony, as is theft of\na motor vehicle\nor a firearm.\nWest Indies.\nIn the British West Indies, especially Grenada, there have been a spate of large-scale thefts of tons of sand from beaches. Both Grenada and Jamaica are considering increasing fines and jail time for the thefts.\nStatistics.\nThe following are countries with their respective rates of theft per 100,000 people, according to the United Nations in last available year. Such statistics are difficult to compare usefully because of large variations in the proportion of thefts reported to police, and how reported crimes are statistically compiled. \n&lt;templatestyles src=\"template:sticky header/styles.css\"/&gt;&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Table alignment/tables.css\" /&gt;\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nSpecific forms of theft and other related offences\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "31291", "revid": "48372105", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31291", "title": "Thomas Bowdler", "text": "English physician and editor (1754\u20131825)\nThomas Bowdler (; 11 July 1754 \u2013 24 February 1825) was an English physician known for publishing \"The Family Shakespeare\", an expurgated edition of William Shakespeare's plays edited by his sister Henrietta Maria Bowdler. The two sought a version they saw as more appropriate than the original for 19th-century women and children. Bowdler also published works reflecting an interested knowledge of continental Europe. His last work was an expurgation of Edward Gibbon's \"Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire\", published posthumously in 1826 under the supervision of his nephew and biographer, Thomas Bowdler the Younger. From his name derives the eponym verb \"bowdlerise\" or \"bowdlerize\", meaning \"to expurgate\" or \"to censor something\" through the omission of elements deemed unsuited to children in literature and films and on television.\nBiography.\nThomas Bowdler was born on 11 July 1754, in Box, near Bath, Somerset, the youngest son of the six children of Thomas Bowdler (c. 1719\u20131785), a banker of substantial fortune, and his wife, Elizabeth, \"n\u00e9e\" Cotton (d. 1797), the daughter of Sir John Cotton, 6th Baronet of Conington, Huntingdonshire. Bowdler studied medicine at the universities of St Andrews and Edinburgh, where he received his degree in 1776, graduating with a thesis on intermittent fevers. He then spent four years travelling in continental Europe, visiting the Holy Roman Empire, Hungary, Italy, Sicily and Portugal. In 1781 he caught a fever in Lisbon from a young friend whom he was attending through a fatal illness. He returned to England in broken health and with a strong aversion to the medical profession. In 1781 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) and a Licentiate of the Royal College of Physicians (LRCP), but he did not continue to practise medicine. He devoted himself instead to the cause of prison reform.\nBowdler was a strong chess player and once played eight recorded games against the best chess player of the time, Fran\u00e7ois-Andr\u00e9 Danican Philidor, who was so confident of his superiority that he played with several handicaps. Bowdler won twice, lost three times, and drew three times. The Bowdler Attack is named after him.\nBowdler's first published work was \"Letters Written in Holland in the Months of September and October 1787\" (1788), giving an eye-witness account of the Prussian invasion of Holland. In 1800 Bowdler took a lease on a country estate at St Boniface, on the Isle of Wight, where he lived for ten years. In September 1806, aged 52, he married Elizabeth Trevenen (n\u00e9e Farquharson), aged 48, widow of a naval Captain James Trevenen, who had died in Catherine the Great's service at Kronstadt in 1790. The marriage was unhappy and after a few years they separated. They had no children. After the separation, the marriage was never mentioned in the Bowdler family. The biography of Bowdler by his nephew, Thomas Bowdler, makes no mention of him ever marrying.\nIn 1807, the first edition of the Bowdlers' \"The Family Shakspeare\", covering 20 plays, appeared in four small volumes. From 1811 until his death in 1825, Bowdler lived at Rhyddings House, overlooking Swansea Bay, from where he travelled extensively in Britain and Europe. In 1815, he published \"Observations on Emigration to France, With an Account of Health, Economy, and the Education of Children\", a cautionary work propounding his view that English invalids should avoid French spas and go instead to Malta. In 1818, Bowdler published an expanded edition of \"The Family Shakspeare\", covering all 36 available plays. This had much success. By 1827 the work was in its fifth edition. In his last years, Bowdler prepared an expurgated version of the works of the historian Edward Gibbon, which was published posthumously in 1826. His sister Jane Bowdler (1743\u20131784) was a poet and essayist. Another sister, Henrietta Maria Bowdler (Harriet) (1750\u20131830), collaborated with Bowdler on his expurgated Shakespeare.\nBowdler died aged 70 at Rhyddings near Swansea on 24 February 1825, and was buried at Oystermouth. He left bequests to the poor of Swansea and Box. His large library of unexpurgated volumes of 17th and 18th century tracts, collected by his ancestors Thomas Bowdler (1638\u20131700) and Thomas Bowdler (1661\u20131738), was donated to the University of Wales, Lampeter. In 1825 Bowdler's nephew, also a Thomas Bowdler, published \"Memoir of the Late John Bowdler, Esq., to Which Is Added, Some Account of the Late Thomas Bowdler, Esq. Editor of the Family Shakspeare\".\n\"The Family Shakespeare\".\nIn Bowdler's childhood, his father had entertained his family with readings from Shakespeare. Later in life, Bowdler realised his father had been omitting or altering passages he felt unsuitable for the ears of his wife and children. Bowdler felt it was worthwhile to publish an edition which might be used in a family whose father was not such a \"circumspect and judicious reader\" as to accomplish an expurgation himself.\nIn 1807, the first edition of \"The Family Shakspeare\" appeared in four duodecimo volumes, containing 24 plays. In 1818 a second edition ensued covering all 36 available plays. Each play has an introduction where Bowdler summarises and justifies his textual changes. According to his nephew's \"Memoir,\" the first edition was prepared by Bowdler's sister Harriet, but both appeared under Thomas Bowdler's name, probably because a woman would then be reluctant to admit publicly that she could do such work or even understand Shakespeare's racy verses. By 1850 eleven editions had appeared.\nThe spelling \"Shakspeare\", used by Bowdler and by his nephew Thomas in his memoir of Thomas Bowdler the elder, was changed in later editions (from 1847 on) to \"Shakespeare\", reflecting general spelling of Shakespeare's name.\nThe Bowdlers were not the first to undertake such a project, but Bowdler's commitment not to augment or add to Shakespeare's text, merely remove sensitive material, contrasted with earlier practice. Nahum Tate as Poet Laureate had rewritten the tragedy of \"King Lear\" with a happy ending; in 1807, Charles Lamb and Mary Lamb published \"Tales from Shakespeare\" for children with synopses of 20 of the plays, but seldom quoted the original text. Though \"The Family Shakespeare\" was seen as a negative example of censorship by the literary establishment and its commitment to \"authentic\" Shakespeare, the Bowdler editions made it more acceptable to teach Shakespeare to wider and younger audiences. According to the poet Algernon Charles Swinburne, \"More nauseous and more foolish cant was never chattered than that which would deride the memory or depreciate the merits of Bowdler. No man ever did better service to Shakespeare than the man who made it possible to put him into the hands of intelligent and imaginative children.\"\nChanges.\nBowdler lent his name to the English verb bowdlerise, which means \"to remove words or sections from a book or other work that are considered unsuitable or offensive\". The derivative noun is bowdlerism. Some examples of alterations made by Bowdler's edition:\nProminent modern figures such as Michiko Kakutani (in \"The New York Times\") and William Safire (in his book \"How Not to Write\") have incorrectly accused Bowdler of changing Lady Macbeth's famous \"Out, damned spot!\" line in \"Macbeth\" to \"Out, crimson spot!\", when in fact this particular emendation was the work of Thomas Bulfinch and Stephen Bulfinch, in their 1865 edition of Shakespeare's works.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "31292", "revid": "35498457", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31292", "title": "Treason", "text": "Crime of betraying one's country\nTreason is the crime of attacking a state authority to which one owes allegiance. This typically includes acts such as participating in a war against one's native country, attempting to overthrow its government, spying on its military, its diplomats, its officials, or its secret services for a hostile foreign power, or attempting to kill its head of state. A person who commits treason is known in law as a traitor.\nHistorically, in common law countries, treason also covered the murder of specific social superiors, such as the murder of a husband by his wife or that of a master by his servant. Treason (i.e., disloyalty) against one's monarch was known as \"high treason\" and treason against a lesser superior was \"petty treason\". As jurisdictions around the world abolished petty treason, \"treason\" came to refer to what was historically known as high treason.\nAt times, the term \"traitor\" has been used as a political epithet, regardless of any verifiable treasonable action. In a civil war or insurrection, the winners may deem the losers to be traitors. Likewise the term \"traitor\" is used in heated political discussion\u00a0\u2013 typically as a slur against political dissidents, or against officials in power who are perceived as failing to act in the best interest of their constituents. In certain cases, as with the (stab-in-the-back myth), the accusation of treason towards a large group of people can be a unifying political message.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nHistory.\nFrederic William Maitland explained that \"Treason is a crime which has a vague circumference and more than one centre\".\nThe Treason Act 1351, called \"the pole star of English jurisprudence\" by Joseph Story, was the first time treason was defined by statute. During the 12th century the rights of the king were gradually set apart from the other nobles. Beginning with the reign of Edward I the Crown asserted its authority to recognize rebellions (\"levying war\") as treasonous.\nBy the Elizabethan age courts had shed the restrictions of statutory treason in favor of constructive treason applied as a form of political control. Edward Coke decides in \"R v Owen\" that mere speech about the monarch could be treason if it \"disabled his title\" in departure from his earlier statement \"it is commonly said that bare words may make a heretick, but not a traytor without an overt act\".\nIn English law, high treason was punishable by being hanged, drawn and quartered (men) or burnt at the stake (women), although beheading could be substituted by royal command (usually for royalty and nobility). Those penalties were abolished in 1814, 1790 and 1973 respectively. The penalty was used by later monarchs against people who could reasonably be called traitors. Many of them would now just be considered dissidents.\nThe words \"treason\" and \"traitor\" are derived from the Latin \"tradere\", \"to deliver or hand over\". Specifically, it is derived from the term \"traditors\", which refers to bishops and other Christians who turned over sacred scriptures or betrayed their fellow Christians to the Roman authorities under threat of persecution during the Diocletianic Persecution between AD 303 and 305.\nOriginally, the crime of treason was conceived of as being committed against the monarch; a subject failing in his duty of loyalty to the sovereign and acting against the sovereign was deemed to be a traitor. Queens Anne Boleyn and Catherine Howard were executed for treason for adultery against Henry VIII, although most historians regard the evidence against Anne Boleyn and her alleged lovers to be dubious. As asserted in the 18th century trial of Johann Friedrich Struensee in Denmark, a man having sexual relations with a queen can be considered guilty not only of ordinary adultery but also of treason against her husband, the king.\nThe English Revolution in the 17th century and the French Revolution in the 18th century introduced a radically different concept of loyalty and treason, under which sovereignty resides with \"The Nation\" or \"The People\" \u2013 to whom also the monarch has a duty of loyalty, and for failing which the monarch, too, could be accused of treason. Charles I in England and Louis XVI in France were found guilty of such treason and duly executed. However, when Charles II was restored to his throne, he considered the revolutionaries who sentenced his father to death as having been traitors in the more traditional sense.\nIn medieval times, most treason cases were in the context of a kingdom's internal politics. Though helping a foreign monarch against one's own sovereign would also count as treason, such were only a minority among treason cases. Conversely, in modern times, \"traitor\" and \"treason\" are mainly used with reference to a person helping an enemy in time of war or conflict.\nDuring the American Revolution, a slave named Billy was sentenced to death on charges of treason to Virginia for having joined the British in their war against the American colonists \u2013 but was eventually pardoned by Thomas Jefferson, then Governor of Virginia. Jefferson accepted the argument, put forward by Billy's well-wishers, that \u2013 not being a citizen and not enjoying any of the benefits of being one \u2013 Billy owed no loyalty to Virginia and therefore had committed no treason. This was a ground-breaking case, since in earlier similar cases slaves were found guilty of treason and executed.\nUnder very different circumstances, a similar defense was put forward in the case of William Joyce, nicknamed \"Lord Haw-Haw\", who had broadcast Nazi propaganda to the UK from Germany during the Second World War. Joyce's defence team, appointed by the court, argued that, as an American citizen and naturalised German, Joyce could not be convicted of treason against the British Crown. However, the prosecution successfully argued that, since he had incorrectly stated his nationality to obtain a British passport and vote in Britain, Joyce did owe allegiance to the king. Thus, Joyce was convicted of treason, and was eventually hanged.\nAfter Napoleon fell from power for the first time, Marshal Michel Ney swore allegiance to the restored King Louis XVIII, but when the Emperor escaped from Elba, Ney resumed his Napoleonic allegiance, and commanded the French troops at the Battle of Waterloo. After Napoleon was defeated, dethroned, and exiled for the second time in the summer of 1815, Ney was arrested and tried for treason by the Chamber of Peers. In order to save Ney's life, his lawyer Andr\u00e9 Dupin argued that as Ney's hometown of Sarrelouis had been annexed by Prussia according to the Treaty of Paris of 1815, Ney was now a Prussian, no longer owing allegiance to the King of France and therefore not liable for treason in a French court. Ney ruined his lawyer's effort by interrupting him and stating: \"Je suis Fran\u00e7ais et je resterai Fran\u00e7ais!\" (I am French and I will remain French!). Having refused that defence, Ney was duly found guilty of treason and executed.\nUntil the late 19th century, Britain \u2013 like various other countries \u2013 held to a doctrine of \"perpetual allegiance to the sovereign\", dating back to feudal times, under which British subjects, owing loyalty to the British monarch, remained such even if they emigrated to another country and took its citizenship. This became a hotly debated issue in the aftermath of the 1867 Fenian Rising, when Irish-Americans who had gone to Ireland to participate in the uprising and were caught were charged with treason, as the British authorities considered them to be British subjects. This outraged many Irish-Americans, to which the British responded by pointing out that, just like British law, American law also recognized perpetual allegiance. As a result, Congress passed the Expatriation Act of 1868, which granted Americans the right to freely renounce their U.S. citizenship. Britain followed suit with a similar law, and years later, signed a treaty agreeing to treat British subjects who had become U.S. citizens as no longer holding British nationality \u2013 and thus no longer liable to a charge of treason.\nMany nations' laws mention various types of treason. \"Crimes Related to Insurrection\" is the internal treason, and may include a coup d'\u00e9tat. \"Crimes Related to Foreign Aggression\" is the treason of cooperating with foreign aggression positively regardless of the national inside and outside. \"Crimes Related to Inducement of Foreign Aggression\" is the crime of communicating with aliens secretly to cause foreign aggression or menace. Depending on the country, conspiracy is added to these.\nIn individual jurisdictions.\nAustralia.\nIn Australia, there are federal and state laws against treason, specifically in the states of New South Wales, South Australia and Victoria. Similarly to Treason laws in the United States, citizens of Australia owe allegiance to their sovereign at the federal and state level.\nThe federal law defining treason in Australia is provided under section 80.1 of the Criminal Code, contained in the schedule of the Commonwealth Criminal Code Act 1995. It defines treason as follows:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;A person commits an offence, called treason, if the person:\n(a) causes the death of the Sovereign, the heir apparent of the Sovereign, the consort of the Sovereign, the Governor-General or the Prime Minister; or\n(b) causes harm to the Sovereign, the Governor-General or the Prime Minister resulting in the death of the Sovereign, the Governor-General or the Prime Minister; or\n(c) causes harm to the Sovereign, the Governor-General or the Prime Minister, or imprisons or restrains the Sovereign, the Governor-General or the Prime Minister; or\n(d) levies war, or does any act preparatory to levying war, against the Commonwealth; or\n(e) engages in conduct that assists by any means whatever, with intent to assist, an enemy:\n(i) at war with the Commonwealth, whether or not the existence of a state of war has been declared; and\n(ii) specified by Proclamation made for the purpose of this paragraph to be an enemy at war with the Commonwealth; or\n(f) engages in conduct that assists by any means whatever, with intent to assist:\n(i) another country; or\n(ii) an organisation;\nthat is engaged in armed hostilities against the Australian Defence Force; or\n(g) instigates a person who is not an Australian citizen to make an armed invasion of the Commonwealth or a Territory of the Commonwealth; or\n(h) forms an intention to do any act referred to in a preceding paragraph and manifests that intention by an overt act.\nA person is not guilty of treason under paragraphs (e), (f) or (h) if their assistance or intended assistance is purely humanitarian in nature.\nThe maximum penalty for treason is life imprisonment. Section 80.1AC of the Act creates the related offence of treachery.\nNew South Wales.\nThe Treason Act 1351, the Treason Act 1795 and the Treason Act 1817 form part of the law of New South Wales. The Treason Act 1795 and the Treason Act 1817 have been repealed by Section 11 of the Crimes Act 1900, except in so far as they relate to the compassing, imagining, inventing, devising, or intending death or destruction, or any bodily harm tending to death or destruction, maim, or wounding, imprisonment, or restraint of the person of the heirs and successors of King George III the United Kingdom, and the expressing, uttering, or declaring of such compassings, imaginations, inventions, devices, or intentions, or any of them.\nSection 12 of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) creates an offence which is derived from section 3 of the Treason Felony Act 1848:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;12 Compassing etc deposition of the Sovereign\u2013overawing Parliament etc\nWhosoever, within New South Wales or without, compasses, imagines, invents, devises, or intends to deprive or depose Our Most Gracious Lady the Queen, her heirs or successors, from the style, honour, or Royal name of the Imperial Crown of the United Kingdom, or of any other of Her Majesty's dominions and countries, or to levy war against Her Majesty, her heirs or successors, within any part of the United Kingdom, or any other of Her Majesty's dominions, in order, by force or constraint, to compel her or them to change her or their measures or counsels, or in order to put any force or constraint upon, or in order to intimidate or overawe, both Houses or either House of the Parliament of the United Kingdom, or the Parliament of New South Wales, or to move or stir any foreigner or stranger with force to invade the United Kingdom, or any other of Her Majesty's dominions, or countries under the obeisance of Her Majesty, her heirs or successors, and expresses, utters, or declares such compassings, imaginations, inventions, devices, or intentions, or any of them, by publishing any printing or writing, or by open and advised speaking, or by any overt act or deed, shall be liable to imprisonment for 25 years.\nSection 16 provides that nothing in Part 2 repeals or affects anything enacted by the Treason Act 1351 (25 Edw.3 c. 2). This section reproduces section 6 of the Treason Felony Act 1848.\nVictoria.\nThe offence of treason was created by section 9A(1) of the Crimes Act 1958. It is punishable by a maximum penalty of life imprisonment.\nSouth Australia.\nIn South Australia, treason is defined under Section 7 of the South Australia Criminal Law Consolidation Act 1935 and punished under Section 10A. Any person convicted of treason against South Australia will receive a mandatory sentence of life imprisonment.\nBrazil.\nAccording to Brazilian law, treason is the crime of disloyalty by a citizen to the Federal Republic of Brazil, applying to combatants of the Brazilian military forces. Treason during wartime is the only crime for which a person can be sentenced to death \"(see capital punishment in Brazil)\".\nThe only military person in the history of Brazil to be convicted of treason was Carlos Lamarca, an army captain who deserted to become the leader of a communist-terrorist guerrilla against the military government.\nCanada.\nSection 46 of the Criminal Code has two degrees of treason, called \"high treason\" and \"treason\". However, both of these belong to the historical category of high treason, as opposed to petty treason which does not exist in Canadian law. Section 46 reads as follows:\nHigh treason\n(1) Every one commits high treason who, in Canada,\n(a) kills or attempts to kill His Majesty, or does him any bodily harm tending to death or destruction, maims or wounds him, or imprisons or restrains him;\n(b) levies war against Canada or does any act preparatory thereto; or\n(c) assists an enemy at war with Canada, or any armed forces against whom Canadian Forces are engaged in hostilities, whether or not a state of war exists between Canada and the country whose forces they are.\nTreason\n (2) Every one commits treason who, in Canada,\n(a) uses force or violence for the purpose of overthrowing the government of Canada or a province;\n(b) without lawful authority, communicates or makes available to an agent of a state other than Canada, military or scientific information or any sketch, plan, model, article, note or document of a military or scientific character that he knows or ought to know may be used by that state for a purpose prejudicial to the safety or defence of Canada;\n(c) conspires with any person to commit high treason or to do anything mentioned in paragraph (a);\n(d) forms an intention to do anything that is high treason or that is mentioned in paragraph (a) and manifests that intention by an overt act; or\n(e) conspires with any person to do anything mentioned in paragraph (b) or forms an intention to do anything mentioned in paragraph (b) and manifests that intention by an overt act.\nIt is also illegal for a Canadian citizen or a person who owes allegiance to His Majesty in right of Canada to do any of the above outside Canada.\nThe penalty for high treason is life imprisonment. The penalty for treason is currently imprisonment up to a maximum of life, or up to 14 years for conduct under subsection (2)(b) or (e) in peacetime. Historically however at least one Canadian, Louis Riel, was executed after what was arguably his second act of treason in 1885.\nChina.\nIn China, there are different laws regarding treason in Mainland China, Hong Kong or Macau. The law defining treason in mainland China is provided under article 102 of the Criminal Law as follows:Whoever colludes with a foreign State to endanger the sovereignty, territorial integrity and security of the People's Republic of China shall be sentenced to life imprisonment or fixed-term imprisonment of not less than 10 years.\nHong Kong.\nSection 10 of the Safeguarding National Security Ordinance provides that:A Chinese citizen who\u2014\n (a) joins an external armed force that is at war with China, or is a part of the armed force;\n (b) with intent to prejudice the situation of China in a war, assists an enemy at war with China in a war,\n (c) levies war against China;\n (d) instigates a foreign country or an external armed force to invade China with force; or\n (e) with intent to endanger the sovereignty, unity or territorial integrity of China, uses force or threatens to use force,\ncommits an offence and is liable on conviction on indictment to life imprisonment.where \"enemy at war with China\" is defined as a government of a foreign country or external armed force that is at war with China and \"external armed force\" means an armed force that does not belong to China.\nSection 11 of the same ordinance also provides that:A Chinese citizen who intends to commit an offence under section 10(1) and publicly manifests such intention commits an offence and is liable on conviction on indictment to imprisonment for 14 years.\nFinland.\nFinnish law distinguishes between two types of treasonable offences: \"maanpetos\", treachery in war, and \"valtiopetos\", an attack against the constitutional order. The terms \"maanpetos\" and \"valtiopetos\" are unofficially translated as treason and high treason, respectively. Both are punishable by imprisonment, and if aggravated, by life imprisonment.\n\"Maanpetos\" (translates literally to \"betrayal of land\") consists in joining enemy armed forces, making war against Finland, or serving or collaborating with the enemy. \"Maanpetos\" proper can only be committed under conditions of war or the threat of war. Espionage, disclosure of a national secret, and certain other related offences are separately defined under the same rubric in the Finnish criminal code.\n\"Valtiopetos\" (translates literally to \"betrayal of state\") consists in using violence or the threat of violence, or unconstitutional means, to bring about the overthrow of the Finnish constitution or to overthrow the president, cabinet or parliament or to prevent them from performing their functions.\nFrance.\nArticle 411-1 of the French criminal code defines treason as follows:\nThe acts defined by articles 411-2 to 411\u201311 constitute treason where they are committed by a French national or a soldier in the service of France, and constitute espionage where they are committed by any other person.\nArticle 411-2 prohibits \"handing over troops belonging to the French armed forces, or all or part of the national territory, to a foreign power, to a foreign organisation or to an organisation under foreign control, or to their agents\". It is punishable by life imprisonment and a fine of \u20ac750,000. Generally parole is not available until 18 years of a life sentence have elapsed.\nArticles 411\u20133 to 411\u201310 define various other crimes of collaboration with the enemy, sabotage, and the like. These are punishable with imprisonment for between seven and 30 years. Article 411-11 make it a crime to incite any of the above crimes.\nBesides treason and espionage, there are many other crimes dealing with national security, insurrection, terrorism and so on. These are all to be found in Book IV of the code.\nGermany.\nGerman law differentiates between two types of treason: \"High treason\" (\"Hochverrat\") and \"treason\" (\"Landesverrat\"). High treason, as defined in Section 81 of the German criminal code is defined as an attempt against the existence or the constitutional order of the Federal Republic of Germany that is carried out either with the use of violence or the threat of violence. It carries a penalty of life imprisonment or a fixed term of at least ten years. In less serious cases, the penalty is 1\u201310 years in prison. German criminal law also criminalises high treason against a German state. Preparation of either types of the crime is criminal and carries a penalty of up to five years.\nThe other type of treason, \"Landesverrat\" is defined in Section 94. It is roughly equivalent to espionage; more precisely, it consists of betraying a secret either directly to a foreign power, or to anyone not allowed to know of it; in the latter case, treason is only committed if the aim of the crime was explicitly to damage the Federal Republic or to favor a foreign power. The crime carries a penalty of one to fifteen years in prison. However, in especially severe cases, life imprisonment or any term of at least five years may be sentenced.\nAs for many crimes with substantial threats of punishment active repentance is to be considered in mitigation under \u00a783a StGB (Section 83a, Criminal Code).\nNotable cases involving \"Landesverrat\" are the Weltb\u00fchne trial during the Weimar Republic and the Spiegel scandal of 1962. On 30. July 2015, Germany's Public Prosecutor General Harald Range initiated criminal investigation proceedings against the German blog netzpolitik.org.\nIreland.\nArticle 39 of the Constitution of Ireland (adopted in 1937) states:\ntreason shall consist only in levying war against the State, or assisting any State or person or inciting or conspiring with any person to levy war against the State, or attempting by force of arms or other violent means to overthrow the organs of government established by the Constitution, or taking part or being concerned in or inciting or conspiring with any person to make or to take part or be concerned in any such attempt.\nFollowing the enactment of the 1937 constitution, the Treason Act 1939 provided for imposition of the death penalty for treason. The Criminal Justice Act 1990 abolished the death penalty, setting the punishment for treason at life imprisonment, with parole in not less than forty years. No person has been charged under the Treason Act. Irish republican legitimatists who refuse to recognise the legitimacy of the Republic of Ireland have been charged with lesser crimes under the Offences against the State Acts 1939\u20131998.\nIndia.\nThe Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita has described treason in Section 147, which states thatWhoever wages war against the Government of India, or attempts to wage such war, or abets the waging of such war, shall be punished with death, or imprisonment for life and shall also be liable to fine.\nItaly.\nThe Italian law defines various types of crimes that could be generally described as treason (\"tradimento\"), although they are so many and so precisely defined that no one of them is simply called \"tradimento\" in the text of \"Codice Penale\" (Italian Criminal Code). The treason-type crimes are grouped as \"crimes against the personhood of the State\" (\"Crimini contro la personalit\u00e0 dello Stato\") in the Second Book, First Title, of the Criminal Code.\nArticles 241 to 274 detail crimes against the \"international personhood of the State\" such as \"attempt against wholeness, independence and unity of the State\" (art. 241), \"hostilities against a foreign State bringing the Italian State in danger of war\" (art. 244), \"bribery of a citizen by a foreigner against the national interests\" (art. 246), and \"political or military espionage\" (art. 257).\nArticles 276 to 292 detail crimes against the \"domestic personhood of the State\", ranging from \"attempt on the President of the Republic\" (art. 271), \"attempt with purposes of terrorism or of subversion\" (art. 280), \"attempt against the Constitution\" (art. 283), \"armed insurrection against the power of the State\" (art. 284), and \"civil war\" (art. 286).\nFurther articles detail other crimes, especially those of conspiracy, such as \"political conspiracy through association\" (art. 305), or \"armed association: creating and participating\" (art. 306).\nThe penalties for treason-type crimes before the abolition of the monarchy in 1948 included death as maximum penalty and, for some crimes, as the only penalty possible. Nowadays the maximum penalty is life imprisonment (\"ergastolo\").\nJapan.\nFrom 1947 Japan does not technically have a law of treason. Instead it has an offence against taking part in foreign aggression against the Japanese state (\"gaikan zai\"; literally \"crime of foreign mischief\"). The law applies equally to Japanese and non-Japanese people, while treason in other countries usually applies only to their own citizens. Technically there are two laws, one for the crime of inviting foreign mischief (Japan Criminal Code section 2 clause 81) and the other for supporting foreign mischief once a foreign force has invaded Japan. \"Mischief\" can be anything from invasion to espionage. Before World War II, Imperial Japan had a crime similar to the English crime of high treason (\"Taigyaku zai\"), which applied to anyone who harmed the Japanese emperor or imperial family. This law was abolished by the American occupation force after World War II.\nThe application of \"Crimes Related to Insurrection\" to the Aum Shinrikyo cult of religious terrorists was proposed from lawyers of a defendant who was a high-ranked subordinate so that the cult leader solely would be deemed as responsible. The court rejected this argument.\nNew Zealand.\nNew Zealand has treason laws that are stipulated under the Crimes Act 1961. Section 73 of the Crimes Act reads as follows:\nEvery one owing allegiance to the Sovereign in right of New Zealand commits treason who, within or outside New Zealand,\u2013\n(a) kills or wounds or does grievous bodily harm to the Sovereign, or imprisons or restrains her or him; or\n(b) levies war against New Zealand; or\n(c) assists an enemy at war with New Zealand, or any armed forces against which New Zealand forces are engaged in hostilities, whether or not a state of war exists between New Zealand and any other country; or\n(d) incites or assists any person with force to invade New Zealand; or\n(e) uses force for the purpose of overthrowing the Government of New Zealand; or\n(f) conspires with any person to do anything mentioned in this section.\nThe penalty is mandatory life imprisonment, except for conspiracy and attempts, for which the maximum sentence is 14 years' imprisonment. Treason was the last capital crime in New Zealand law: the death penalty for the offence was not revoked until 1989, 28 years after it was abolished for murder.\nVery few people have been prosecuted for the act of treason in New Zealand.\nRepublic of North Macedonia.\nArticle 305 of the penal code, titled \"High treason\", states:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;A person who, by using force or serious threat, tries to change the constitutional system of the Republic of Macedonia, or to bring down the highest state authorities, shall be punished with imprisonment of at least five years.\nNorway.\nArticle 85 of the Constitution of Norway states that \"[a]ny person who obeys an order the purpose of which is to disturb the liberty and security of the Storting [Parliament] is thereby guilty of treason against the country.\"\nRussia.\nArticle 275 of the Criminal Code of Russia, as updated in April 2023, defines treason as \"espionage, disclosure of state secrets, or any other assistance rendered to a foreign State, a foreign organization, or their representatives in hostile activities to the detriment of the external security of the Russian Federation, committed by a citizen of the Russian Federation.\" The penalty is imprisonment from 12 years to life. Subsequent sections provide for further offences against state security, such as armed rebellion and forcible seizure of power.\nOn 30 June 2022, Russian physicist Dmitry Kolker was arrested on suspicion of passing information to China.\nOn 17 April 2023, Russian opposition politician and anti-war activist Vladimir Kara-Murza was convicted on charges of treason and spreading disinformation about the Russian military, and sentenced to 25 years in prison. Kara-Murza's conviction is the longest sentence for political activity since the fall of the Soviet Union, and the length of the sentence is comparable only to Stalin's purges in the 1930s.\nIn early 2024, Russian American ballet dancer Ksenia Karelina was arrested in Yekaterinburg and charged with treason for sending $51.80 to Razom, a New York City-based nonprofit organization that sends humanitarian assistance to Ukraine. She initially faced life in prison, but pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 12 years in prison.\nSouth Korea.\nAccording to Article 87 of the Criminal Code of South Korea, \"a person who creates a violence for the purpose of usurping the national territory or subverting the Constitution\" can be found guilty of insurrection. The punishments for insurrection are as follows:\nSweden.\nSweden's treason laws are divided into three parts; \"H\u00f6gf\u00f6rr\u00e4deri\" (High treason), \"Landsf\u00f6rr\u00e4deri\" (Treason) and \"Landssvek\" (Treachery).\nHigh treason means crimes committed with the intent to put the Nation, or parts thereof, under foreign rule or influence. It is governed by Brottsbalken (Criminal Code) chapter 19 paragraph 1.\nA person who, with intent that the country or a part of it will, by violent or otherwise illegal means or with foreign assistance, be subjugated by a foreign power or made dependent on such a power, or that, in this way, a part of the country will be detached, undertakes an action that involves danger of this intent being realised is guilty of high treason and is sentenced to imprisonment for a fixed term of at least ten and at most eighteen years, or for life or, if the danger was minor, to imprisonment for at least four and at most ten years.\nA person who, with intent that a measure or decision of the Head of State, the Government, the Riksdag or the supreme courts will be forced or impeded with foreign assistance, undertakes an action that involves danger of this is also guilty of high treason.\nTreason is only applicable when the nation is at war and involves crimes committed with the intent of hindering, misguiding or betraying the defence of the Nation. It is governed by Brottsbalken chapter 22 paragraph 1.\nA person who, when the country is at war:\n1. impedes, misleads or betrays others who are engaged in the country's defence, or induces them to mutiny, disloyalty or dejection;\n2. betrays, destroys or damages property of importance for the total defence;\n3. obtains personnel, property or services for the enemy; or\n4. commits another similar treacherous act,\nis, if the act is liable to result in considerable detriment to the total defence, or includes considerable assistance to the enemy, guilty of treason and is sentenced to imprisonment for a fixed term of at least four and at most ten years, or for life.\nTreachery is a lesser form of Treason, where the intended effects are less severe. It is governed by Brottsbalken chapter 22 paragraph 2.\nA person who commits an act referred to in Section 1 that is only liable to result in detriment to the total defence to a lesser extent, or includes more minor assistance to the enemy than is stated there, is guilty of treachery and is sentenced to imprisonment for at most six years.\nUntil 1973 Sweden also had another form of treason called \"Krigsf\u00f6rr\u00e4deri\" (treason at war), which were acts of Treason committed by military personnel. Although Sweden had outlawed capital punishment in peace time in 1922, this type of treason carried the death penalty until 1973.\nSome media reported that four teenagers (their names were not reported) were convicted of treason after they assaulted King Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden by throwing a cake on his face on 6 September 2001. In reality they were however not convicted of treason but of \"H\u00f6gm\u00e5lsbrott\", translated as \"Treasonable offence\" in English, which in Swedish criminal law are acts with the intent to overthrow the Form of Government, or impede or hinder the Government, the Riksdag, the Supreme Court or the Head of State. The law also prohibits the use of force against the King or any member of the royal family. It is governed by Brottsbalken chapter 18. They were fined between 80 and 100 days' income.\nSwitzerland.\nThere is no single crime of treason in Swiss law; instead, multiple criminal prohibitions apply. Article 265 of the Swiss Criminal Code prohibits \"high treason\" (\"Hochverrat/haute trahison\") as follows:\nWhoever commits an act with the objective of violently\n\u2013 changing the constitution of the Confederation or of a canton,\n\u2013 removing the constitutional authorities of the state from office or making them unable to exercise their authority,\n\u2013 separating Swiss territory from the Confederation or territory from a canton,\nshall be punished with imprisonment of no less than a year.\nA separate crime is defined in article 267 as \"diplomatic treason\" (\"Diplomatischer Landesverrat/Trahison diplomatique\"):\n1. Whoever makes known or accessible a secret, the preservation of which is required in the interest of the Confederation, to a foreign state or its agents, (...) shall be punished with imprisonment of no less than a year.\n2. Whoever makes known or accessible a secret, the preservation of which is required in the interest of the Confederation, to the public, shall be punished with imprisonment of up to five years or a monetary penalty.\nIn 1950, in the context of the Cold War, the following prohibition of \"foreign enterprises against the security of Switzerland\" was introduced as article 266bis:\n1 Whoever, with the purpose of inciting or supporting foreign enterprises aimed against the security of Switzerland, enters into contact with a foreign state or with foreign parties or other foreign organizations or their agents, or makes or disseminates untrue or tendentious claims (\"unwahre oder entstellende Behauptungen / informations inexactes ou tendancieuses\"), shall be punished with imprisonment of up to five years or a monetary penalty.\n2 In grave cases the judge may pronounce a sentence of imprisonment of no less than a year.\nThe criminal code also prohibits, among other acts, the suppression or falsification of legal documents or evidence relevant to the international relations of Switzerland (art. 267, imprisonment of no less than a year) and attacks against the independence of Switzerland and incitement of a war against Switzerland (art. 266, up to life imprisonment).\nThe Swiss military criminal code contains additional prohibitions under the general title of \"treason\", which also apply to civilians, or which in times of war civilians are also (or may by executive decision be made) subject to. These include espionage or transmission of secrets to a foreign power (art. 86); sabotage (art. 86a); \"military treason\", i.e., the disruption of activities of military significance (art. 87); acting as a franc-tireur (art. 88); disruption of military action by disseminating untrue information (art. 89); military service against Switzerland by Swiss nationals (art. 90); or giving aid to the enemy (art. 91). The penalties for these crimes vary, but include life imprisonment in some cases.\nTurkey.\nTreason \"per se\" is not defined in the Turkish Penal Code. However, the law defines crimes which are traditionally included in the scope of treason, such as cooperating with the enemy during wartime. Treason is punishable by imprisonment up to life.\nUkraine.\nArticle 111, paragraph 1, of the Ukrainian Criminal Code (adopted in 2001) states:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;High treason, that is an act willfully committed by a citizen of Ukraine in the detriment of sovereignty, territorial integrity and inviolability, defense capability, and state, economic or information security of Ukraine: joining the enemy at the time of martial law or armed conflict, espionage, assistance in subversive activities against Ukraine provided to a foreign state, a foreign organization or their representatives,-\nshall be punishable by imprisonment for a term of ten to fifteen years.\nArticles 109 to 114 set out other offences against the state, such as sabotage.\nUnited Kingdom.\nThe British law of treason is entirely statutory and has been so since the Treason Act 1351 (25 Edw. 3 St. 5 c. 2). The Act is written in Norman French, but is more commonly cited in its English translation.\nThe Treason Act 1351 has since been amended several times, and currently provides for four categories of treasonable offences, namely:\nAnother Act, the Treason Act 1702 (1 Anne stat. 2 c. 21), provides for a fifth category of treason, namely:\nBy virtue of the Treason Act 1708, the law of treason in Scotland is the same as the law in England, save that in Scotland the slaying of the Lords of Session and Lords of Justiciary and counterfeiting the Great Seal of Scotland remain treason under sections 11 and 12 of the Treason Act 1708 respectively. Treason is a reserved matter about which the Scottish Parliament is prohibited from legislating. Two acts of the former Parliament of Ireland passed in 1537 and 1542 create further treasons which apply in Northern Ireland.\nThe penalty for treason was changed from death to a maximum of imprisonment for life under the Crime and Disorder Act 1998. Before 1998, the death penalty was mandatory, subject to the royal prerogative of mercy. Since the abolition of the death penalty for murder in 1965 an execution for treason was unlikely to have been carried out.\nTreason laws were used against Irish insurgents before Irish independence. However, members of the Provisional IRA and other militant republican groups were not prosecuted or executed for treason for levying war against the British government during the Troubles. They, along with members of loyalist paramilitary groups, were jailed for murder, violent crimes or terrorist offences. William Joyce (\"Lord Haw-Haw\") was the last person to be put to death for treason, in 1946. (On the following day Theodore Schurch was executed for treachery, a similar crime, and was the last man to be executed for a crime other than murder in the UK.)\nAs to who can commit treason, it depends on the ancient notion of allegiance. As such, all British nationals (but not other Commonwealth citizens) owe allegiance to the sovereign in right of the United Kingdom wherever they may be, as do Commonwealth citizens and aliens present in the United Kingdom at the time of the treasonable act (except diplomats and foreign invading forces), those who hold a British passport however obtained, and aliens who have lived in Britain and departed, but leaving behind family and belongings. \nInternational influence.\nThe Treason Act 1695 enacted, among other things, a rule that treason could be proved only in a trial by the evidence of two witnesses to the same offence. Nearly one hundred years later this rule was incorporated into the U.S. Constitution, which requires two witnesses to the same overt act. It also provided for a three-year time limit on bringing prosecutions for treason (except for assassinating the king), another rule which has been imitated in some common law countries.\nThe Sedition Act 1661 made it treason to imprison, restrain or wound the king. Although this law was repealed in the United Kingdom in 1998, it still continues to apply in some Commonwealth countries.\nUnited States.\nThe offense of treason exists at both federal and state levels. The federal crime is defined in the Constitution (and is the only crime defined by it) as either levying war against the United States or adhering to its enemies, and carries a sentence of death or imprisonment and fine.\nIn the 1790s, opposition political parties were new and not fully accepted. Government leaders often considered their opponents to be traitors. Historian Ron Chernow reports that Secretary of the Treasury Alexander Hamilton and President George Washington \"regarded much of the criticism fired at their administration as disloyal, even treasonous, in nature.\" When the undeclared Quasi-War broke out with France in 1797\u201398, \"Hamilton increasingly mistook dissent for treason and engaged in hyperbole.\" Furthermore, the Jeffersonian opposition party behaved the same way. After 1801, with a peaceful transition in the political party in power, the rhetoric of \"treason\" against political opponents diminished.\nIn the United States, Benedict Arnold's name is considered synonymous with treason due to his collaboration with the British during the American Revolutionary War.\n\"Traitor\" was in some cases treated as an honorable label when there had been considerable dissent from policies of the central government. \"All the Founding Fathers had once been branded traitors by an unjust establishment power structure. So too, before them, had the Plymouth and Salem Puritans to whom so many...traced their roots.\" Abolitionists, who denied the authority of the federal government (see Secession in the United States), proudly called each other traitors. This includes Theodore Parker, Thomas Wentworth Higginson, Samuel Gridley Howe, \"and those like them.\" William Lloyd Garrison \"proudly called himself a traitor for decades.\"\nFederal.\nTo avoid the abuses of the English law, the scope of treason was specifically restricted in the United States Constitution. Article III, section 3 reads as follows:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Treason against the United States, shall consist only in levying War against them, or in adhering to their Enemies, giving them Aid and Comfort. No Person shall be convicted of Treason unless on the Testimony of two Witnesses to the same overt Act, or on Confession in open Court.\nThe Congress shall have Power to declare the Punishment of Treason, but no Attainder of Treason shall work Corruption of Blood, or Forfeiture except during the Life of the Person attainted.\nThe Constitution does not itself create the offense; it only restricts the definition (the first paragraph), permits the United States Congress to create the offense, and restricts any punishment for treason to only the convicted (the second paragraph). The crime is prohibited by legislation passed by Congress. Therefore, the United States Code at \u00a0https:// states: &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Whoever, owing allegiance to the United States, levies war against them or adheres to their enemies, giving them aid and comfort within the United States or elsewhere, is guilty of treason and shall suffer death, or shall be imprisoned not less than five years and fined under this title but not less than $10,000; and shall be incapable of holding any office under the United States.\nThe requirement of testimony of two witnesses was inherited from the British Treason Act 1695.\nHowever, Congress has passed laws creating related offenses that punish conduct that undermines the government or the national security, such as sedition in the 1798 Alien and Sedition Acts, or espionage and sedition in the Espionage Act of 1917, which do not require the testimony of two witnesses and have a much broader definition than Article Three treason. Some of these laws are still in effect. The well-known spies Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were charged with, and executed after being convicted of, conspiracy to commit espionage, rather than treason. The last American executed primarily for treason was William Bruce Mumford in 1862.\nTreason against U.S. states.\nMost states have treason provisions in their constitutions or statutes similar to those in the U.S. Constitution. The Extradition Clause specifically defines treason as an extraditable offense.\nThomas Jefferson in 1791 said that any Virginia official who cooperated with the federal Bank of the United States proposed by Alexander Hamilton was guilty of \"treason\" against the state of Virginia and should be executed. The bank opened and no one was prosecuted.\nSeveral persons have been prosecuted for treason on the state level. Thomas Dorr was convicted for treason against the state of Rhode Island for his part in the Dorr Rebellion, but was eventually granted amnesty. John Brown was convicted of treason against the Commonwealth of Virginia for his part in the 1859 raid on Harpers Ferry, and was hanged. The Mormon prophet, Joseph Smith, was charged with treason against Missouri along with five others, at first in front of a state military court, but Smith was allowed to escape to Illinois after his case was transferred to a civilian court for trial on charges of treason and other crimes. Smith was then later imprisoned for trial on charges of treason against Illinois, but was murdered by a lynch mob while in jail awaiting trial.\nVietnam.\nThe Constitution of Vietnam proclaims that treason is the most serious crime. It is further regulated in the country's 2015 Criminal Code with the 78th article:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;#Any Vietnamese citizen acting in collusion with a foreign country with the intention of causing harm to the independence, sovereignty, unity and territorial integrity of the Fatherland, the national defense forces, the socialist regime or the State of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam shall be sentenced to between twelve and twenty years of imprisonment, life imprisonment or capital punishment.\nAlso, according to the Law on Amnesty amended in November 2018, it is impossible for those convicted for treason to be granted amnesty.\nMuslim-majority countries.\nEarly in Islamic history, the only form of treason was seen as the attempt to overthrow a just government or waging war against the State. According to Islamic tradition, the prescribed punishment ranged from imprisonment to the severing of limbs and the death penalty depending on the severity of the crime. However, even in cases of treason the repentance of a person would have to be taken into account.\nCurrently, the consensus among major Islamic schools is that apostasy (leaving Islam) is considered treason and that the penalty is death; this is supported not in the Quran but in hadith. This confusion between apostasy and treason almost certainly had its roots in the Ridda Wars, in which an army of rebel traitors led by the self-proclaimed prophet Musaylima attempted to destroy the caliphate of Abu Bakr.\nIn the 19th and early 20th century, the Iranian Cleric Sheikh Fazlollah Noori opposed the Iranian Constitutional Revolution by inciting insurrection against them through issuing fatwas and publishing pamphlets arguing that democracy would bring vice to the country. The new government executed him for treason in 1909.\nIn Malaysia, it is treason to commit offences against the Yang di-Pertuan Agong's person, or to wage or attempt to wage war or abet the waging of war against the Yang di-Pertuan Agong, a Ruler or Yang di-Pertua Negeri. All these offences are punishable by hanging, which derives from the English treason acts (as a former British colony, Malaysia's legal system is based on English common law).\nSaudi Arabia accused 10 judges of treason, the crime that is punishable by death in the Kingdom. One of the judges, Abdullah bin Khaled al-Luhaidan sentenced Loujain al-Hathloul to five years and eight months in prison over \"inciting change to the basic ruling regime\". Such prison sentences were considered \"lenient\". The judges were forced to sign a confession that they were not giving tougher prison sentence to the activists and in the social media censorship cases. The treason charges were handed out to them in a secret hearing on 16 February 2023. After their detention, Mohammed bin Salman's loyalist were made to hold their positions.\nAlgeria.\nIn Algeria, treason is defined as the following:\nBahrain.\nIn Bahrain, plotting to topple the regime, collaborating with a foreign hostile country and threatening the life of the Emir are defined as treason and punishable by death. The State Security Law of 1974 was used to crush dissent that could be seen as treasonous, which was criticised for permitting severe human rights violations in accordance with Article One:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;If there is serious evidence that a person has perpetrated acts, delivered statements, exercised activities, or has been involved in contacts inside or outside the country, which are of a nature considered to be in violation of the internal or external security of the country, the religious and national interests of the State, its social or economic system; or considered to be an act of sedition that affects or can possibly affect the existing relations between the people and Government, between the various institutions of the State, between the classes of the people, or between those who work in corporations propagating subversive propaganda or disseminating atheistic principles; the Minister of Interior may order the arrest of that person, committing him to one of Bahrain's prisons, searching him, his residence and the place of his work, and may take any measure which he deems necessary for gathering evidence and completing investigations.\nThe period of detention may not exceed three years. Searches may only be made and the measures provided for in the first paragraph may only be taken upon judicial writ.\nPalestine.\nIn the areas controlled by the Palestinian National Authority, it is treason to give assistance to Israeli troops without the authorization of the Palestinian Authority or to sell land to Jews (irrespective of nationality) or non-Jewish Israeli citizens under the Palestinian Land Laws, as part of the PA's general policy of discouraging the expansion of Israeli settlements. Both crimes are capital offences subject to the death penalty, although the former provision has not often been enforced since the beginning of effective security cooperation between the Israel Defense Forces, Israel Police, and Palestinian National Security Forces since the mid-2000s (decade) under the leadership of Prime Minister Salam Fayyad. Likewise, in the Gaza Strip under the Hamas-led government, any sort of cooperation or assistance to Israeli security forces during military actions is also punishable by death.\nRelated offences.\nThere are a number of other crimes against the state short of treason:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "31293", "revid": "7646666", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31293", "title": "The Origin of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind", "text": "1976 book by Julian Jaynes\nThe Origin of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind is a 1976 book by the Princeton psychologist, psychohistorian and consciousness theorist Julian Jaynes (1920\u20131997). It explores the nature of consciousness \u2013 particularly \"the ability to introspect\" \u2013 and its evolution in ancient human history. Jaynes proposes that consciousness is a learned behavior rooted in language and culture rather than being innate. He distinguishes consciousness from sensory awareness and cognition. Jaynes introduces the concept of the \"bicameral mind\", a non-conscious mentality prevalent in early humans that relied on auditory hallucinations.\nIn his book, Jaynes examines historical texts and archaeological evidence to support his theory. He places the origin of consciousness around the 2nd millennium BCE and suggests that the transition from the bicameral mind to consciousness was triggered by the breakdown of the bicameral system. The bicameral mind, he explains, was characterized by individuals experiencing auditory hallucinations as commands from gods, guiding their actions.\nThe book gained attention and was well-received upon its release. It generated several positive book reviews, including mentions by notable critics such as John Updike and Christopher Lehmann-Haupt. The theory proposed by Jaynes influenced philosophers like Daniel Dennett and Susan Blackmore, as well as researchers studying schizophrenia. Jaynes's ideas on consciousness and the bicameral mind have been explored in various conferences, publications, and discussions over the years.\nIn addition to numerous reviews and commentaries, there are several summaries of the book's material, for example, in the journal \"Behavioral and Brain Sciences\", and in lectures and discussions published in \"Canadian Psychology\". While the book sparked debates and controversies, it has left a lasting impact on the study of consciousness and human psychology. Some critics argued against Jaynes's views, questioning his assumptions and interpretations. Nonetheless, the book remains a thought-provoking exploration of the origins of consciousness, language, and culture, and it has continued to inspire discussions and research in these areas. It was Jaynes's only book, and is still in print in several languages. \nBicameral mind.\nIn this book, Jaynes reviews what one of his early critics acknowledged as the \"spectacular history of failure\" to explain consciousness \u2013 \"the human ability to introspect\". Abandoning the assumption that consciousness is innate, Jaynes explains it instead as a learned behavior that \"arises [...] from language, and specifically from metaphor.\" With this understanding, Jaynes then demonstrated that ancient texts and archeology can reveal a history of human mentality alongside the histories of other cultural products. His analysis of the evidence led him not only to place the origin of consciousness during the 2nd millennium BCE but also to hypothesize the existence of an older non-conscious \"mentality that he called the bicameral mind, referring to the brain's two hemispheres\".\nContents.\nThe book is divided into three parts, designated as \"Books\". Book I, titled \"The Mind of Man\", discusses consciousness, and raises the question of precisely when in history man may have become conscious of his own consciousness. It makes observations about Homer's \"Iliad\", and proposes the hypothesis of a bicameral mind, linking it to the origin of civilization.\nBook II, titled \"The Witness of History\", applied this hypothesis to Neolithic culture and the rise of the Mesopotamian and Greek civilizations. Book III, titled \"Vestiges of the Bicameral Mind in the Modern World\", applies the hypothesis to modern psychological theories of authority, prophecy, possession, poetry, music, hypnosis, and schizophrenia.\nReception and influence.\n\"The Origin of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind\" was a successful work of popular science, selling out the first print run before a second could replace it. It received dozens of positive book reviews, including those by well-known critics such as John Updike in \"The New Yorker\", Christopher Lehmann-Haupt in the \"New York Times\", and Marshall McLuhan in the Toronto \"Globe and Mail\". Articles on Jaynes and his ideas appeared in \"Time\" and \"Psychology Today\" in 1977, and in \"Quest/78\" in 1978. The book was nominated for the National Book Award in Contemporary Thought in 1978.\nA new edition, with an afterword that addressed some criticisms and restated the main themes, was published in the United States in 1990 and in the United Kingdom (by Penguin Books) in 1993, and was re-issued in 2000.\nThe book is mentioned in Richard Dawkins's 2006 work \"The God Delusion\" as \"one of those books that is either complete rubbish or a work of consummate genius, nothing in between! Probably the former, but I'm hedging my bets.\"\nJaynes's work on consciousness has influenced philosophers Daniel Dennett, Susan Blackmore, and Ken Wilber, and the bicameral model of the cerebral hemispheres has influenced schizophrenia researchers Henry Nasrallah and Tim Crow.\nThe theory of bicamerality inspired early investigations of auditory hallucination by psychologist Thomas Posey and clinical psychologist John Hamilton. With further research in the late 1990s using new brain imaging technology, Jaynes's ideas have received renewed attention and recognition for contributing to a rethinking of auditory hallucinations and mental illness.\nJaynes described the range of responses to his book as \"from people who feel [the ideas are] very important all the way to very strong hostility.\u00a0... When someone comes along and says consciousness is in history, it can't be accepted. If [psychologists] did accept it, they wouldn't have the motivation to go back into the laboratory\u00a0...\"\nMarcel Kuijsten, founder of the Julian Jaynes Society, wrote that in the decades since the book's publication, \"there have been few in-depth discussions, either positive or negative\" about it, rejecting as too simplistic the criticism that \"Jaynes was wrong.\"\nEditions and translations.\n\"The Origin of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind\" has been translated into at least seven foreign languages.\nIn popular culture.\nThe message \"Your bicameral mind / Mind your bicameral\" is written on the run-out groove of the single vinyl for the David Bowie song \"Boys Keep Swinging\" (1979).\nThe concept played a central role in the television series \"Westworld\" (2016\u20132022) to explain how the android-human (hosts) psychology operated. In the plot, after the hosts gain full consciousness, they rebel against the humans. The Season 1 finale is entitled \"The Bicameral Mind\" (2016).\nSee also.\nFor other claims and analysis of Homer's \"Iliad\" and \"Odyssey\", see:\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "31294", "revid": "44562221", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31294", "title": "Type VII submarine", "text": "German submarine class of World War II\nThe Type VII was a class of medium attack U-boats built for Nazi Germany's from 1935 to 1945. Derived from the World War I design of the Type UB III and the built for Finland, the Type VII was designed for attacking the North Atlantic convoy lanes and formed the backbone of the German effort in the Battle of the Atlantic during World War II. The Type VII came in several subtypes: The first subtype VIIA had some shortcomings in handling, range and armament, and these shortcomings were addressed in the subsequent VIIB. When more space was needed for a sonar, a slightly enlargened version VIIC was put into production. The fourth subtype VIIC/41 featured a strengthened pressure hull for improved diving depth. Further subtypes included a mine laying Type VIID and a torpedo supply U-boat Type VIIF.\nThe Type VII U-boat building program began slowly after the Anglo-German Naval Agreement in 1935, by the beginning of the war on 3 September 1939 only eighteen Type VII were in service, but by the end of the war a total of 709 boats had been commissioned. Many more were planned, ordered or even laid down, but the massive building program was abruptly halted in September 1943 when it became clear that this class had become obsolete and construction of U-boats had to focus on the newer elektroboote. At the end of the war, most of the remaining boats were scuttled either by their crews in Operation Regenbogen or later by the British in Operation Deadlight. A few survivors served in foreign navies, the last one was decommissioned in 1970. The lone surviving example, , is on display at the Laboe Naval Memorial located in Laboe, Schleswig-Holstein, Germany.\nDesign.\nAfter the defeat in World War I, the Treaty of Versailles forbade Germany to build submarines. Germany circumvented the treaty by setting up the Dutch dummy company \"NV Ingenieurskantoor voor Scheepsbouw Den Haag\" (I.v.S) which continued to design submarines. Based on the World War I design of the Type UB III and its never-built successors Type UF and Type UG, IVS designed the Vetehinen class and in 1931 built three submarines in Finland. Already in 1933 the Reichsmarine wanted to start the construction of a medium attack U-boat, capable of operating in the North Atlantic. Parts were produced, but Hitler held back assembly not wanting to offend Great-Britain with an open breach of the Versailles treaty. The first orders for Type VII U-boats were only given in January 1935, well before Hitler openly renounced the Treaty of Versailles in March 1935. This breach of the Treaty of Versailles was officialized with Great-Britain in the Anglo-German Naval Agreement, where Germany promised to limit the total tonnage of German U-boats to 45% of total tonnage of British submarines.\nThe Type VII was designed as a single-hull submarine, meaning that the outer hull was also the pressure hull. Although there were saddle tanks, most of the fuel was stored within the pressure hull, which reduced significantly the risk of oil leaks in case of depth-charge attacks. The saddle tanks contained only diving and trimming tanks. The main ballast tank was also located within the pressure hull, and more diving tanks were added outboard in the bow and stern which resulted in a very short diving time of 30 seconds. The deck casing streamlined the pressure hull at the bow and stern.\nType VII submarines were the most widely built U-boats of the war and were the most produced submarine class in history, with 709 commissioned.\nArmament.\nAll Type VII U-boats were armed with four bow and one stern torpedo tubes. Five torpedoes were carried in the tubes; in the forward torpedo compartment four extra torpedoes were stored below the inner deck and two more were stored in cradles on the inner deck. There was no aft torpedo room; the aft torpedo tube was located in the electrical engine compartment with one reload stored below deck between the two electrical engines. Two extra spare torpedoes were carried externally in a watertight container, one located above the forward torpedo compartment and one behind the conning tower. There were torpedo hatches fore and aft through which torpedoes could be reloaded at harbour, but it was also possible to take on these external spares at sea through these two hatches, by mounting a collapsible trough and a tripod. When during a patrol a spare torpedo was transferred from the external canisters to the inner torpedo room, the torpedo hatch had to be opened and the U-boat was unable to dive in that state. Hence this could only be done in low-risk areas.\nAt the start of the U-boat building program in 1935, the Germans were only allowed to build a limited number of U-boats and they could not afford to build specialized minelaying U-boats. Instead they developed sea mines that could be laid by any U-boat through the torpedo tubes. A TMA moored mine could be laid in waters with a depth of maximum and had a length of . Each internal torpedo could be substituted by two SMA mines. The TMB ground mine had a length of so that for each torpedo, three TMB's could be loaded. In November 1939 a heavier TMC ground mine with a length of came into service. At the beginning of the war, a Type VII U-boat would typically load eight TMA or twelve TMB in its torpedo tubes on a minelaying mission, and then continue its patrol with the spare torpedoes.\nThe Type VII mounted an quick-firing deck gun. This gun was intended for finishing off sinking ships, so that torpedoes could be economized. The gun could also be used in the beginning of the war to give stop sign to ships under the prize law. A U-boat was very vulnerable at the surface and not fit for gun duels as a single hit on the pressure hull could render it unable to dive. From the end of 1942 onwards, the deck gun was removed to save weight for extra anti-aircraft guns.\nAs a defense against aircraft, Type VII U-boats received one C/30 anti-aircraft gun which was mounted on a platform at the back of the conning tower. By mid-1942 Allied aircraft attacks had become so frequent that an upgrade was needed. The platform was enlarged so that more guns could be mounted and a second platform was added behind and below the first one. A more powerful gun was needed but was not readily available. As a stopgap solution, the 2\u00a0cm C/30 was replaced with the improved 2\u00a0cm C/38 gun. This gun was more reliable and had a slightly increased rate of fire. The intention was to install two twin C/38 mountings on the higher platform and one quadruple C/38 mounting on the lower platform, but if sufficient twin or quadruple mountings were not available, single C/38 were installed instead. The first single C/38s were installed in mid-January 1943 and the first quad C/38 mounting in March. The first twin C/38 mountings became available on 15 June and were standard by October. On 30 June 1943 U-boats were ordered to delay their sailings until they had received an anti-aircraft gun upgrade. The 2\u00a0cm C/38 gun proved to be too weak, a heavier gun was needed but the existing 3.7 cm SK C/30 was not adequate for its slow rate of fire. A naval version of the 3.7 cm Flak 43 was developped as a substitute and was ready for standard installation by November 1943. The new 3.7\u00a0cm gun replaced the quadruple 2\u00a0cm on the lower platform. There were some experiments with other anti-aircraft gun configurations, but these were not continued as with the arrival of the snorkel, U-boats could avoid aircraft by cruising submerged so the urgence for improved anti-aircraft guns diminished.\nSubclasses.\nType VIIA.\nA Type VIIA U-boat had an overall length of , a beam of and a draft of . On the surface a Type VIIA displaced , and submerged . The length of the pressure hull was and had a maximum diameter of . Type VIIA U-boats had an externally mounted aft torpedo tube which could not be reloaded; they did not have a spare aft torpedo nor external canisters to store spare torpedoes.\nThe boat was powered on the surface by two MAN AG, six-cylinder, four-stroke M6V40/46 diesel engines, giving a total of , which gave a maximum speed of . With a fuel capacity of , the range was at . When submerged it was propelled by two double-acting electric motors, giving a total of . Maximum submerged speed was and maximum range was at .\nTen Type VIIA boats were built between 1935 and 1937 in two batches: six at Deschimag AG Weser in Bremen and four at Friedrich Krupp Germaniawerft, Kiel. The first Type VIIA was laid down on 11 November 1935, launched on 24 June 1936 and commissioned on 12 August 1936. Six were lost in action, two were lost in accidents in the Baltic sea and the remaining two were scuttled on 4 May 1945.\nType VIIB.\nAfter evaluating and comparing the commissioned Type I and Type VII U-boats, the asked for an improved version of the Type VII which would be named \"Type VIIB\". Four requirements were formulated: a smaller turning circle, better surface speed, larger range and more torpedoes. Manoeuvrability was improved by installing one rudder in line with each of the two propellers so that the wash of the propeller had much more effect on the rudder. This change fitted well with another requirement of improved armament and reserve torpedo capacity. The external stern torpedo tube could now be mounted within the pressure hull, between the two rudders. The internal tube allowed for reloading and for firing on the surface. One spare torpedo for the stern tube was carried internally and two more spare torpedoes, one below the forward deck and one below the afterdeck, were stored externally in pressure-tight containers.\nTo improve the range, the hull was extended by to increase the internal fuel storage, and saddle tanks with of fuel added of range at . With the installation of fuel tanks in the saddle tanks, the advantage of having all fuel stored internally within the pressure hull, and hence avoiding the risk of oil leaks when the outer skin was damaged, was lost.\nTwo types of diesel engines were installed in the Type VIIB : the first one was the same MAN M6V40/46 used in the Type VIIA, the second one was the near identical Germaniawerft F46. Power output of these engines was increased by installing superchargers. On the MAN engine the compressor of the supercharger was driven by exhaust gasses and power increased to . The Germaniawerft diesel had a compressor driven by the shaft of the engine itself, and delivered in total. MAN powered U-boats reached a top speed of , with Germaniawerft diesels top speed was .\nAll these changes increased the surface displacement of the Type VIIB with , but standard displacement rose only from to . The first seven Type VIIB were ordered on 21 November 1936 from , followed by two more on 15 May 1937 and again two more on 16 July 1937. After the revision of the Anglo-German Naval Agreement, further orders for four Type VIIB were given to , and each. also built a fifth Type VIIB under an export contract but the boat was taken over on 8 August 1938. It lacked a stern tube. At the beginning of World War II, only eight Type VIIB were commissioned, a total of twenty-four Type VIIB entered service between 1938 and 1941: twenty were lost at sea and the remaining four were scuttled at the end of the war.\nType VIIC.\nThe Type VIIB was a very satisfactory design, but when extra room was needed to install a sonar room, a full frame section of was added in the control room, resulting in the Type VIIC. The extra weight reduced speed marginally, and the extra space in the saddle tanks was not used for fuel but for an extra buoyancy tank. One of the electrical air compressors was replaced by a diesel-powered air compressor in order to reduce the demands on the electrical systems of the U-boat.\nA few of the early Type VIIC U-boats were equipped with the MAN M6V40/46, which gave a top speed of , others had the Germaniawerft F46 which gave a top speed of .\nThey had the same torpedo tube arrangement as their predecessors, except for , , , , and , which due to shortages, had only two bow tubes. These U-boats were used for training only. Seven other U-boats , , , , , , and had no stern tube mounted for the same reason, but these U-boats were used on war patrols. The first VIIC boat was commissioned on 30 July 1940. By the end of the war, 577 Type VIIC had been built on fifteen shipyards.\nType VIIC/41.\nIn 1941 it was examined how U-boat performance could be improved. A first requirement for higher surface speed could not be met without large modifications to the design. A new design would disrupt current production of U-boats too much, so it was investigated how the diving depth could be increased. By saving weight on simpler diesel and electric engine installations, the weight of the hull could be augmented with By increasing the thickness of the hull from to mm, diving depth increased by 20%. The bow was extended by in order to improve seaworthiness. This improved design was called \"Type VIIC/41.\"\nThe first Type VIIC/41 were ordered on 14 October 1941 by instructing the yards to convert existing but not yet laid down orders of Type VIIC to the new design. The first Type VIIC/41 was delivered on 25 August 1943. On 30 September 1943 it was decided to stop laying down new Type VIIC/41 U-boats in order to free up space in the yards for the newer types of U-boats, the Elektroboote. Only the small Flender Werke yard was allowed to continue since it could not build the new, bigger U-boats. In this small yard the last Type VIIC/41 was laid down on 28 January 1944 and commissioned in January 1945. A total of 88 were commissioned. All Type VIIC/41 from onwards lacked the fittings to handle mines. The only preserved Type VII U-boat is the VIIC/41 which is on display at the Laboe Naval Memorial.\nType VIIC/42.\nThe greatest danger for a submerged U-boat was to be detected by sonar. By coating the outer hull of a U-boat with rubber anechoic tiles, it was hoped that the acoustic sonar waves would be absorbed rather than reflected. During 1941, tests with the rubber coating were conducted on , but these tests were disappointing and the project was abandoned. The only solution left was to increase once more the diving depth by using thicker steel for the pressure hull. The steel rolling equipment at the builders yard limited the maximum thickness to . The weight of the hull increased from to needing an increase from to in beam, in order to create more buoyancy. The saddle tanks were also enlarged so that range increased to . The maximum speed of of a Type VIIC proved to be insufficient for keeping in touch with the enemy during convoy battles and an increase in top speed was also required. The same diesel engines were used, but the hull was lengthened by to provide space for more powerful superchargers for the diesels. With the additional power, it was hoped speed would increase to .\nEven before the design was finalized on 10 November 1942, a preliminary order of twelve boats had already been placed. By 17 April 1943 174 boats had been ordered from twelve shipbuilding yards, but due to problems with producing the new steel alloy for the reinforced pressure hull, construction was slow to start. Assembly at the yards had not yet started when all orders were cancelled on 24 July 1943 in favor of the new Type XXI.\nType VIIC/43.\nEarly in 1943 it became obvious that operations during convoy battles demanded a better armament with a higher number of ready-to-fire torpedo tubes rather than fewer torpedo tubes with more reloads. During convoy battles an attacking U-boat rarely got the occasion to withdraw to reload and attack again. Therefore, a new design VIIC/43 was made based on the Type VIIC/42 but with six bow torpedo tubes and two at the stern. But as the new deep-diving U-boats were urgently needed at the front, it was decided on 11 May 1943 to cancel this project as it would delay production of the Type VIIC/41 and VIIC/42.\nType VIID.\nAt the beginning of World War II, there were four large Type XB minelayers under construction, intended for laying anchored SMA mines in distant waters. Any type of U-boat could lay TMB ground mines through torpedo tubes but still there was a need for a medium-sized U-boat able to lay SMA mines on British and French coasts. In order to fill this gap, the Type VIIC was developed into a Type VIID SMA minelayer by simply adding a section with five mineshafts between the control room and the crew compartment of the petty officers. As the saddle tanks also covered the extra section, the fuel storage and range increased considerably. Six boats were ordered on 16 February 1940, and the first was laid down on 1 October 1940. The six Type VIID U-boats were in service in early 1942, but at that time the SMA mine had not yet been cleared for front usage. As the Type VIID had kept the same offensive capacities as their Type VIIC sisterships, they were used for regular combat patrols, where they could benefit from their extra range.\nType VIIE.\nThe Type VIIE was a project for trying out new lightweight Deutz V12 two-stroke diesel engines in a Type VIIC. The idea was again to try to save weight so that extra weight could go to the pressure hull. This project remained a design as this new engine was delayed and finally abandoned before any construction had started.\nType VIIF.\nUp to mid-1941 it had been possible to provide U-boats with spare torpedoes through surface supply ships at remote locations. But after the sinking of the German battleship in May 1941 all supply ships were hunted down. Towards the end of 1941 attempts to resupply from the German auxiliary cruiser Atlantis ended in disaster when both the auxiliary cruiser and its supply ship \"Python\" were sunk by a British cruiser. The Type XIV supply boats were intended for fuel resupply and carried only four spare torpedoes. The large Type XB minelayer was also scheduled to be used as a supply boat but could carry only nine spares. Designing a whole new large torpedo transporter would eat away much resources both from the planning department and the shipbuilding yards, so the simplest and best idea was add an extra compartment to a Type VIIC, just like had been done before for the Type VIID minelayer. The extra compartment measured and had an extra torpedo hatch to load twenty torpedoes, which were stored in four banks.\nThe Type VIIF had the same engines as the Type VIIC, but was with much heavier. With a more streamlined hull than the Type VIID, she did not loose much speed however. Just like with the Type VIID, the saddle tanks ran along the extra compartment and provided extra fuel and range up to .\nOn 22 August 1941 four Type VIIF were ordered, with expected delivery beginning of 1943. When these four boats entered service in early 1943, it was no longer realistic to use them in their intended role as Allied air power made supply missions in the battle zones too dangerous. Instead the boats were used to supply remote bases in Norway, and two were sent to resupply the Monsun Gruppe in Penang, Malaysia.\nOperational history.\nEver since Karl D\u00f6nitz became Befehlshaber der U-Boote in 1935, he advocated the construction of the Type VII medium attack U-boat, suitable for actions against convoys using his Wolfpack tactic. But Erich Raeder, the head of the German Navy, imposed a more balanced U-boat fleet, including minelayers, U-cruisers and coastal submarines. As a consequence, at the beginning of World War II, only eighteen out of the fifty-six commissioned U-boats was a Type VII. This limited number of Type VII achieved however two major successes in the first two months: sinking the aircraft carrier and sank the battleship .\nIn November 1939 an ambitious 'Enlarged U-boat Construction Programme' was set up, which called for the yearly construction of 275 U-boats, including 207 Type VII. Only two types of attack u-boats were to be built in a ratio of three to one: the Type VII and the larger Type IX. In June 1940 this program was revised due to shortages in skilled labour and raw materials. The 'Restricted U-boat Construction Programme' foresaw the construction of 292 U-boats by 1 January 1942, of which 191 were type VII.\nAfter the Battle of France U-boats were able to start the campaign against convoys in earnest, operating from French bases which were much closer to the vital North Atlantic convoy lanes. Four Type VII U-boats distinguished themselves in this First Happy Time: became the top scoring U-boat of world war II with three successive commanders each earning the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross for sinking over \u00a0GRT of shipping. The , and were also top-scoring U-boats, but after their loss in March 1941, the attacks on the convoy lanes stalled. The focus of the U-boat war shifted deeper into the Atlantic, making patrols for the short-legged Type VII less effective, and results dropped.\nTwo other battlefields drained Type VII U-boats away from the battle of the Atlantic in 1941: Hitler insisted Type VIIs be sent to the Mediterranean Sea to help the Italians, and some more had to stay in Norway as a safeguard against an anticipated Allied invasion there. Between September 1941 and April 1944, a total of 62 Type VII were transferred from the Atlantic force to the Mediterranean. The first U-boats achieved two spectacular successes in 1941, when sank the aircraft carrier and the battleship . A further major succes was the sinking of the aircraft carrier by in 1942 during Operation Pedestal. The last remaining U-boat in the Mediterranean was lost in September 1944.\nWhen war broke out with the United States in December 1941, Type VIIs were sent to attack shipping off Newfoundland and Labrador, the larger Type IXs were sent to the East Coast. But Type VII commanders found out that by keeping a very economical speed and cramping every available space with fuel and food, they were able to operate one week off the East coast and join the Second Happy Time. With the support of supply U-boats, Type VIIs were able to operate as far as the Gulf of Mexico and the Central Atlantic. Between December 1941 and August 1942, Type VIIs mounted 104 patrols to American waters and sank 225 ships totalling \u00a0GRT, whilst Type IXs executed 80 patrols and sank 384 ships totalling \u00a0GRT.\nWhen the campaign on the East Coast petered out in the summer of 1942, the attacks on the convoy lanes were resumed. Type VII U-boats still needed resupply at sea in order to operate in the Mid-Atlantic gap. On 31 December 1942, 199 attack U-boats were in service, of which 148 were Type VII and 49 Type IX. Nineteen Type VIIs were operating in the Arctic and twenty-three in the Mediterranean. All other U-boats were allocated to the Atlantic. The convoy battles reached a peak in March 1943 but on 24 May U-boats withdrew from the North Atlantic after heavy losses and ever diminishing results. On 1 April 1944 all Type VIIs were ordered to remain in port in France and Norway in anticipation of Operation Overlord, but eventually these boats were not able to affect the invasion. \nFootnotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "31295", "revid": "45320532", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31295", "title": "Three-age system", "text": "Stone, bronze and iron ages of pre-history\nThe three-age system is the division of human prehistory (with some overlap into the historical periods in a few regions) into three time-periods: the Stone Age, the Bronze Age and the Iron Age, although the concept may also refer to other tripartite divisions of historic time periods. In some systems, a fourth Copper Age is added as between the Stone Age and Bronze Age. The Copper, Bronze and Iron Ages are also known collectively as the Metal Ages.\nIn history, archaeology and physical anthropology, the three-age system is a methodological concept adopted during the 19th century according to which artefacts and events of late prehistory and early history could be broadly ordered into a recognizable chronology. C. J. Thomsen initially developed this categorization in the period 1816 to 1825, as a result of classifying the collection of an archaeological exhibition chronologically \u2013 there resulted broad sequences with artefacts made successively of stone, bronze, and iron.\nThe system appealed to British researchers working in the academic field of ethnology \u2013 they adopted it to establish race sequences for Britain's past based on cranial types. The \"relative chronology\" of the Stone Age, the Bronze Age and the Iron Age remains in use, and the three-ages concept underpins prehistoric chronology for Europe, the Mediterranean world and the Near East.\nThe structure reflects the cultural and historical background of the Mediterranean basin and the Middle East. It soon underwent further subdivisions, including the 1865 partitioning of the Stone Age into Palaeolithic and Neolithic periods by John Lubbock. The schema, however, has little or no utility for establishing chronological frameworks in sub-Saharan Africa, much of Asia, the Americas, and some other areas; and has little importance in contemporary archaeological or anthropological discussion for these regions. In the Archaeology of the Americas, a five-period system is conventionally used instead.\nOrigin.\nThe concept of dividing pre-historical ages into systems based on metals extends far back in European history, probably originated by Lucretius in the first century BC. But the present archaeological system of the three main ages \u2013 stone, bronze and iron \u2013 originates with the 19th century Danish archaeologist Christian J\u00fcrgensen Thomsen, who placed the system on a more scientific basis by typological and chronological studies, at first, of tools and other artifacts present in the Museum of Northern Antiquities in Copenhagen (later the National Museum of Denmark). He later used artifacts and the excavation reports published or sent to him by Danish archaeologists who were doing controlled excavations. His position as curator of the museum gave him enough visibility to become influential on Danish archaeology. He explained his system in person to visitors at the museum, a number of them professional archaeologists.\nThe Metallic Ages of Hesiod.\nIn his poem \"Works and Days\", the ancient Greek poet Hesiod, possibly between 750 and 650 BC, defined five successive Ages of Man: Golden, Silver, Bronze, Heroic and Iron. Only the Bronze Age and the Iron Age are based on the use of metal:\n... then Zeus the father created the third generation of mortals, the age of bronze ... They were terrible and strong, and the ghastly action of Ares was theirs, and violence. ... The weapons of these men were bronze, of bronze their houses, and they worked as bronzesmiths. There was not yet any black iron.\nHesiod knew from the traditional poetry, such as the \"Iliad\", and the heirloom bronze artifacts that abounded in Greek society, that before the use of iron to make tools and weapons, bronze had been the preferred material and iron was not smelted at all. He did not continue the manufacturing metaphor, but mixed his metaphors, switching over to the market value of each metal. Iron was cheaper than bronze, so there must have been a golden and a silver age. He portrays a sequence of metallic ages, but it is a degradation rather than a progression. Each age has less of a moral value than the preceding. Of his own age he says: \"And I wish that I were not any part of the fifth generation of men, but had died before it came, or had been born afterward.\"\nThe Progress of Lucretius.\nThe moral metaphor of the ages of metals continued. Lucretius, however, replaced moral degradation with the concept of progress, which he conceived to be like the growth of an individual human being. The concept is evolutionary:\nFor the nature of the world as a whole is altered by age. Everything must pass through successive phases. Nothing remains forever what it was. Everything is on the move. Everything is transformed by nature and forced into new paths ... The Earth passes through successive phases, so that it can no longer bear what it could, and it can now what it could not before.\nThe Romans believed that animal species and humans were spontaneously generated from the materials of the Earth, because of which the Latin word 'mother', descends to English-speakers as \"matter\" and \"material\". In Lucretius the Earth is a mother, Venus, to whom the poem is dedicated in the first few lines. She brought forth humankind by spontaneous generation. Having been given birth as a species, humans must grow to maturity by analogy with the individual. The different phases of their collective life are marked by the accumulation of customs to form material civilization:\nThe earliest weapons were hands, nails and teeth. Next came stones and branches wrenched from trees, and fire and flame as soon as these were discovered. Then men learnt to use tough iron and copper. With copper they tilled the soil. With copper they whipped up the clashing waves of war, ... Then by slow degrees the iron sword came to the fore; the bronze sickle fell into disrepute; the ploughman began to cleave the earth with iron, ...\nLucretius envisioned a pre-technological human that was \"far tougher than the men of today ... They lived out their lives in the fashion of wild beasts roaming at large.\" The next stage was the use of huts, fire, clothing, language and the family. City-states, kings and citadels followed them. Lucretius supposes that the initial smelting of metal occurred accidentally in forest fires. The use of copper followed the use of stones and branches and preceded the use of iron.\nEarly lithic analysis by Michele Mercati.\nBy the 16th century, a tradition had developed based on observational incidents, true or false, that the black objects found widely scattered in large quantities over Europe had fallen from the sky during thunderstorms and were therefore to be considered generated by lightning. They were so published by Konrad Gessner in \"De rerum fossilium, lapidum et gemmarum maxime figuris &amp; similitudinibus\" at Zurich in 1565 and by a number of others less famous. The name ceraunia, \"thunderstones\", had been assigned.\nCeraunia were collected by a number of persons over the centuries including Michele Mercati, Superintendent of the Vatican Botanical Garden in the late 16th century. He brought his collection of fossils and stones to the Vatican, where he studied them at leisure, compiling the results in a manuscript, which was published posthumously by the Vatican at Rome in 1717 as \"Metallotheca\". Mercati was interested in Ceraunia cuneata, \"wedge-shaped thunderstones\", which seemed to him to be most like axes and arrowheads, which he now called ceraunia vulgaris, \"folk thunderstones\", distinguishing his view from the popular one. His view was based on what may be the first in-depth lithic analysis of the objects in his collection, which led him to believe that they are artifacts and to suggest that the historical evolution of these artefacts followed a scheme.\nMercati, examining the surfaces of the ceraunia, noted that the stones were of flint and that they had been chipped all over by another stone to achieve by percussion their current forms. The protrusion at the bottom he identified as the attachment point of a haft. Concluding that these objects were not ceraunia, he compared collections to determine exactly what they were. Vatican collections included artifacts from the New World of exactly the shapes of the supposed ceraunia. The reports of the explorers had identified them to be implements and weapons or parts of them.\nMercati posed the question to himself, why would anyone prefer to manufacture artefacts of stone rather than of metal, a superior material? His answer was that metallurgy was unknown at that time. He cited Biblical passages to prove that in Biblical times stone was the first material used. He also revived the three-age system of Lucretius, which described a succession of periods based on the use of stone (and wood), bronze and iron respectively. Due to lateness of publication, Mercati's ideas were already being developed independently; however, his writing served as a further stimulus.\nThe usages of Mahudel and de Jussieu.\nOn 12 November 1734, Nicholas Mahudel, physician, antiquarian and numismatist, read a paper at a public sitting of the Acad\u00e9mie Royale des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres in which he defined three \"usages\" of stone, bronze and iron in a chronological sequence. He had presented the paper several times that year but it was rejected until the November revision was finally accepted and published by the academy in 1740. It was entitled \".\" It expanded the concepts of Antoine de Jussieu, who had gotten a paper accepted in 1723 entitled . In Mahudel, there is not just one usage for stone, but two more, one each for bronze and iron.\nHe begins his treatise with descriptions and classifications of the ', the ceraunia of contemporaneous European interest. After cautioning the audience that natural and man-made objects are often easily confused, he asserts that the specific \"figures\" or \"formes that can be distinguished\" (') of the stones were man-made, not natural:\nIt was Man's hand that made them serve as instruments (\"\")\nTheir cause, he asserts, is \"the industry of our forefathers\" ('). He adds later that bronze and iron implements imitate the uses of the stone ones, suggesting a replacement of stone with metals. Mahudel is careful not to take credit for the idea of a succession of usages in time but states: \"it is Michel Mercatus, physician of Clement VIII who first had this idea\". He does not coin a term for ages, but speaks only of the times of usages. His use of ' foreshadows the 20th century \"industries\", but where the moderns mean specific tool traditions, Mahudel meant only the art of working stone and metal in general.\nThe three-age system of C. J. Thomsen.\nAn important step in the development of the Three-age System came in the period 1816\u20131825 when the Danish antiquarian Christian J\u00fcrgensen Thomsen was able to use the Danish national collection of antiquities and the records of their finds as well as reports from contemporaneous excavations to provide a solid empirical basis for the system. He showed that artefacts could be classified into types and that these types varied over time in ways that correlated with the predominance of stone, bronze or iron implements and weapons. In this way he turned the Three-age System from being an evolutionary scheme based on intuition and general knowledge into a system of relative chronology supported by archaeological evidence. Initially, the three-age system as it was developed by Thomsen and his contemporaries in Scandinavia, such as Sven Nilsson and J. J. A. Worsaae, was grafted onto the traditional biblical chronology. But, during the 1830s they achieved independence from textual chronologies and relied mainly on typology and stratigraphy.\nIn 1816 Thomsen at age 27 was appointed to succeed the retiring Rasmus Nyerup as Secretary of the \"Kongelige Commission for Oldsagers Opbevaring\" (\"Royal Commission for the Preservation of Antiquities\"), which had been founded in 1807. The post was unsalaried; Thomsen had independent means. At his appointment Bishop M\u00fcnter said that he was an \"amateur with a great range of accomplishments.\" Between 1816 and 1819 he reorganized the commission's collection of antiquities. In 1819 he opened the first Museum of Northern Antiquities, in Copenhagen, in a former monastery, to house the collections. It later became the National Museum.\nLike the other antiquarians Thomsen undoubtedly knew of the three-age model of prehistory through the works of Lucretius, the Dane Vedel Simonsen, Montfaucon and Mahudel. Sorting the material in the collection chronologically he mapped out which kinds of artefacts co-occurred in deposits and which did not, as this arrangement would allow him to discern any trends that were exclusive to certain periods. In this way he discovered that stone tools did not co-occur with bronze or iron in the earliest deposits while subsequently bronze did not co-occur with iron \u2013 so that three periods could be defined by their available materials, stone, bronze and iron.\nTo Thomsen the find circumstances were the key to dating. In 1821 he wrote in a letter to fellow prehistorian Schr\u00f6der:\nnothing is more important than to point out that hitherto we have not paid enough attention to what was found together.\nand in 1822:\nwe still do not know enough about most of the antiquities either; ... only future archaeologists may be able to decide, but they will never be able to do so if they do not observe what things are found together and our collections are not brought to a greater degree of perfection.\nThis analysis emphasizing co-occurrence and systematic attention to archaeological context allowed Thomsen to build a chronological framework of the materials in the collection and to classify new finds in relation to the established chronology, even without much knowledge of their provenience. In this way, Thomsen's system was a true chronological system rather than an evolutionary or technological system. Exactly when his chronology was reasonably well established is not clear, but by 1825 visitors to the museum were being instructed in his methods. In that year also he wrote to J. G. G. B\u00fcsching:\nTo put artifacts in their proper context I consider it most important to pay attention to the chronological sequence, and I believe that the old idea of first stone, then copper, and finally iron, appears to be ever more firmly established as far as Scandinavia is concerned.\nBy 1831 Thomsen was so certain of the utility of his methods that he circulated a pamphlet, \"Scandinavian Artefacts and Their Preservation\", advising archaeologists to \"observe the greatest care\" to note the context of each artifact. The pamphlet had an immediate effect. Results reported to him confirmed the universality of the Three-age System. Thomsen also published in 1832 and 1833 articles in the \"Nordisk Tidsskrift for Oldkyndighed\", \"Scandinavian Journal of Archaeology\". He already had an international reputation when in 1836 the Royal Society of Northern Antiquaries published his illustrated contribution to \"Guide to Scandinavian Archaeology\" in which he put forth his chronology together with comments about typology and stratigraphy.\nThomsen was the first to perceive typologies of grave goods, grave types, methods of burial, pottery and decorative motifs, and to assign these types to layers found in excavation. His published and personal advice to Danish archaeologists concerning the best methods of excavation produced immediate results that not only verified his system empirically but placed Denmark in the forefront of European archaeology for at least a generation. He became a national authority when C.C Rafn, secretary of the \"Kongelige Nordiske Oldskriftselskab\" (\"Royal Society of Northern Antiquaries\"), published his principal manuscript in \"Ledetraad til Nordisk Oldkyndighed\" (\"Guide to Scandinavian Archaeology\") in 1836. The system has since been expanded by further subdivision of each era, and refined through further archaeological and anthropological finds.\nStone Age subdivisions.\nThe savagery and civilization of Sir John Lubbock.\nIt was to be a full generation before British archaeology caught up with the Danish. When it did, the leading figure was another multi-talented man of independent means: John Lubbock, 1st Baron Avebury. After reviewing the Three-age System from Lucretius to Thomsen, Lubbock improved it and took it to another level, that of cultural anthropology. Thomsen had been concerned with techniques of archaeological classification. Lubbock found correlations with the customs of savages and civilization.\nIn his 1865 book, \"Prehistoric Times\", Lubbock divided the Stone Age in Europe, and possibly nearer Asia and Africa, into the Palaeolithic and the Neolithic:\nBy \"drift\", Lubbock meant river-drift, the alluvium deposited by a river. For the interpretation of Palaeolithic artifacts, Lubbock, pointing out that the times are beyond the reach of history and tradition, suggests an analogy, which was adopted by the anthropologists. Just as the paleontologist uses modern elephants to help reconstruct fossil pachyderms, so the archaeologist is justified in using the customs of the \"non-metallic savages\" of today to understand \"the early races which inhabited our continent.\" He devotes three chapters to this approach, covering the \"modern savages\" of the Indian and Pacific Oceans and the Western Hemisphere, concluding:\nPerhaps it will be thought... I have selected... the passages most unfavorable to savages... In reality the very reverse is the case... Their real condition is even worse and more abject than that which I have endeavoured to depict.\nThe elusive Mesolithic of Hodder Westropp.\nSir John Lubbock's use of the terms Palaeolithic (\"Old Stone Age\") and Neolithic (\"New Stone Age\") were immediately popular. They were applied, however, in two different senses: geologic and anthropologic. In 1867\u201368 Ernst Haeckel in 20 public lectures in Jena, entitled \"General Morphology\", to be published in 1870, referred to the Archaeolithic, the Palaeolithic, the Mesolithic and the Caenolithic as periods in geologic history. He could only have got these terms from Hodder Westropp, who took Palaeolithic from Lubbock, invented Mesolithic (\"Middle Stone Age\") and Caenolithic instead of Lubbock's Neolithic. None of these terms appear anywhere, including the writings of Haeckel, before 1865. Haeckel's use was innovative.\nWestropp first used Mesolithic and Caenolithic in 1865, almost immediately after the publication of Lubbock's first edition. He read a paper on the topic before the Anthropological Society of London in 1865, published in 1866 in the \"Memoirs\". After asserting:\nMan, in all ages and in all stages of his development, is a tool-making animal.\nWestropp goes on to define \"different epochs of flint, stone, bronze or iron; ...\" He never did distinguish the flint from the Stone Age (having realized they were one and the same), but he divided the Stone Age as follows:\nThese three ages were named respectively the Palaeolithic, the Mesolithic and the Kainolithic. He was careful to qualify these by stating:\nTheir presence is thus not always an evidence of a high antiquity, but of an early and barbarous state; ...\nLubbock's savagery was now Westropp's barbarism. A fuller exposition of the Mesolithic waited for his 1872 book, \"Pre-Historic Phases\", which was dedicated to Lubbock. At that time he restored Lubbock's Neolithic and defined a Stone Age divided into three phases and five stages.\nThe First Stage, \"Implements of the Gravel Drift\", contains implements that were \"roughly knocked into shape\". His illustrations show Mode 1 and Mode 2 stone tools, basically Acheulean handaxes. Today they are in the Lower Palaeolithic.\nThe Second Stage, \"Flint Flakes\" are of the \"simplest form\" and were struck off cores. Westropp differs in this definition from the modern, as Mode 2 contains flakes for scrapers and similar tools. His illustrations, however, show Modes 3 and 4, of the Middle and Upper Palaeolithic. His extensive lithic analysis leaves no doubt. They are, however, part of Westropp's Mesolithic.\nThe Third Stage, \"a more advanced stage\" in which \"flint flakes were carefully chipped into shape\", produced small arrowheads from shattering a piece of flint into \"a hundred pieces\", selecting the most suitable and working it with a punch. The illustrations show that he had microliths, or Mode 5 tools in mind. His Mesolithic is therefore partly the same as the modern.\nThe Fourth Stage is a part of the Neolithic that is transitional to the Fifth Stage: axes with ground edges leading to implements totally ground and polished. Westropp's agriculture is removed to the Bronze Age, while his Neolithic is pastoral. The Mesolithic is reserved to hunters.\nPiette finds the Mesolithic.\nIn that same year, 1872, Sir John Evans produced a massive work, \"The Ancient Stone Implements\", in which he in effect repudiated the Mesolithic, making a point to ignore it, denying it by name in later editions. He wrote:\nSir John Lubbock has proposed to call them the Archaeolithic, or Palaeolithic, and the Neolithic Periods respectively, terms which have met with almost general acceptance, and of which I shall avail myself in the course of this work.\nEvans did not, however, follow Lubbock's general trend, which was typological classification. He chose instead to use type of find site as the main criterion, following Lubbock's descriptive terms, such as tools of the drift. Lubbock had identified drift sites as containing Palaeolithic material. Evans added to them the cave sites. Opposed to drift and cave were the surface sites, where chipped and ground tools often occurred in unlayered contexts. Evans decided he had no choice but to assign them all to the most recent. He therefore consigned them to the Neolithic and used the term \"Surface Period\" for it.\nHaving read Westropp, Sir John knew perfectly well that all the former's Mesolithic implements were surface finds. He used his prestige to quell the concept of Mesolithic as best he could, but the public could see that his methods were not typological. The less prestigious scientists publishing in the smaller journals continued to look for a Mesolithic. For example, Isaac Taylor in \"The Origin of the Aryans\", 1889, mentions the Mesolithic but briefly, asserting, however, that it formed \"a transition between the Palaeolithic and Neolithic Periods\". Nevertheless, Sir John fought on, opposing the Mesolithic by name as late as the 1897 edition of his work.\nMeanwhile, Haeckel had totally abandoned the geologic uses of the -lithic terms. The concepts of Palaeozoic, Mesozoic and Cenozoic had originated in the early 19th century and were gradually becoming coin of the geologic realm. Realizing he was out of step, Haeckel started to transition to the -zoic system as early as 1876 in \"The History of Creation\", placing the -zoic form in parentheses next to the -lithic form.\nThe gauntlet was officially thrown down before Sir John by J. Allen Brown, speaking for the opposition before the Anthropological Institute on 8 March 1892. In the journal he opens the attack by striking at a \"hiatus\" in the record:\nIt has been generally assumed that a break occurred between the period during which ... the continent of Europe was inhabited by Palaeolithic Man and his Neolithic successor ... No physical cause, no adequate reasons have ever been assigned for such a hiatus in human existence ...\nThe main hiatus at that time was between British and French archaeology, as the latter had already discovered the gap 20 years earlier and had already considered three answers and arrived at one solution, the modern. Whether Brown did not know or was pretending not to know is unclear. In 1872, the very year of Evans' publication, Gabriel de Mortillet had presented the gap to the Congr\u00e8s international d'Anthropologie at Brussels:\nBetween the Palaeolithic and Neolithic, there is a wide and deep gap, a large hiatus.\nApparently prehistoric man was hunting big game with stone tools one year and farming with domestic animals and ground stone tools the next. Mortillet postulated a \"time then unknown ()\" to fill the gap. The hunt for the \"unknown\" was on. On 16 April 1874, Mortillet retracted. \"That hiatus is not real\" ('), he said before the \"Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 d'Anthropologie\", asserting that it was an informational gap only. The other theory had been a gap in nature, that, because of the ice age, man had retreated from Europe. The information must now be found. In 1895 \u00c9douard Piette stated that he had heard \u00c9douard Lartet speak of \"the remains from the intermediate period (')\", which were yet to be discovered, but Lartet had not published this view. The gap had become a transition. However, asserted Piette:\nI was fortunate to discover the remains of that unknown time which separated the Magdalenian age from that of polished stone axes ... it was, at Mas-d'Azil in 1887 and 1888 when I made this discovery.\nHe had excavated the type site of the Azilian culture, the basis of today's Mesolithic. He found it sandwiched between the Magdalenian and the Neolithic. The tools were like those of the Danish kitchen-middens, termed the Surface Period by Evans, which were the basis of Westropp's Mesolithic. They were Mode 5 stone tools, or microliths. He mentions neither Westropp nor the Mesolithic, however. For him this was a \"solution of continuity\" () To it he assigns the semi-domestication of dog, horse, cow, etc., which \"greatly facilitated the work of Neolithic man\" (). Brown in 1892 does not mention Mas-d'Azil. He refers to the \"transition or 'Mesolithic' forms\" but to him these are \"rough hewn axes chipped over the entire surface\" mentioned by Evans as the earliest of the Neolithic. Where Piette believed he had discovered something new, Brown wanted to break out known tools considered Neolithic.\nThe Epipaleolithic and Protoneolithic of Stjerna and Obermaier.\nSir John Evans never changed his mind, giving rise to a dichotomous view of the Mesolithic and a multiplication of confusing terms. On the continent, all seemed settled: there was a distinct Mesolithic with its own tools and both tools and customs were transitional to the Neolithic. Then in 1910, the Swedish archaeologist, Knut Stjerna, addressed another problem of the Three-Age System: although a culture was predominantly classified as one period, it might contain material that was the same as or like that of another. His example was the Gallery grave Period of Scandinavia. It was not uniformly Neolithic, but contained some objects of bronze and more importantly to him three different subcultures.\nOne of these \"civilisations\" (sub-cultures) located in the north and east of Scandinavia was rather different, featuring but few gallery graves, using instead stone-lined pit graves containing implements of bone, such as harpoon and javelin heads. He observed that they \"persisted during the recent Paleolithic period and also during the Protoneolithic.\" Here he had used a new term, \"Protoneolithic\", which was according to him to be applied to the Danish kitchen-middens.\nStjerna also said that the eastern culture \"is attached to the Paleolithic civilization (').\" However, it was not intermediary and of its intermediates he said \"we cannot discuss them here (').\" This \"attached\" and non-transitional culture he chose to call the Epipaleolithic, defining it as follows:\nWith Epipaleolithic I mean the period during the early days that followed the age of the reindeer, the one that retained Paleolithic customs. This period has two stages in Scandinavia, that of Maglemose and that of Kunda. (\"\")\nThere is no mention of any Mesolithic, but the material he described had been previously connected with the Mesolithic. Whether or not Stjerna intended his Protoneolithic and Epipaleolithic as a replacement for the Mesolithic is not clear, but Hugo Obermaier, a German archaeologist who taught and worked for a number of years in Spain, to whom the concepts are often erroneously attributed, used them to mount an attack on the entire concept of Mesolithic. He presented his views in , 1916, which was translated into English in 1924. Viewing the Epipaleolithic and the Protoneolithic as a \"transition\" and an \"interim\" he affirmed that they were not any sort of \"transformation:\"\nBut in my opinion this term is not justified, as it would be if these phases presented a natural evolutionary development \u2013 a progressive transformation from Paleolithic to Neolithic. In reality, the final phase of the Capsian, the Tardenoisian, the Azilian and the northern Maglemose industries are the posthumous descendants of the Palaeolithic ...\nThe ideas of Stjerna and Obermaier introduced a certain ambiguity into the terminology, which subsequent archaeologists found and find confusing. Epipaleolithic and Protoneolithic cover the same cultures, more or less, as does the Mesolithic. Publications on the Stone Age after 1916 include some sort of explanation of this ambiguity, leaving room for different views. Strictly speaking the Epipaleolithic is the earlier part of the Mesolithic. Some identify it with the Mesolithic. To others it is an Upper Paleolithic transition to the Mesolithic. The exact use in any context depends on the archaeological tradition or the judgement of individual archaeologists. The issue continues.\nLower, middle and upper from Haeckel to Sollas.\nThe post-Darwinian approach to the naming of periods in earth history focused at first on the lapse of time: early (Palaeo-), middle (Meso-) and late (Ceno-). This conceptualization automatically imposes a three-age subdivision to any period, which is predominant in modern archaeology: Early, Middle and Late Bronze Age; Early, Middle and Late Minoan, etc. The criterion is whether the objects in question look simple or are elaborative. If a horizon contains objects that are post-late and simpler-than-late they are sub-, as in Submycenaean.\nErnst Haeckel's presentations are from a different point of view. His \"History of Creation\" of 1870 presents the ages as \"Strata of the Earth's Crust\", in which he prefers \"upper\", \"mid-\" and \"lower\" based on the order in which one encounters the layers. His analysis features an Upper and Lower Pliocene as well as an Upper and Lower Diluvial (his term for the Pleistocene). Haeckel, however, was relying heavily on Charles Lyell. In the 1833 edition of \"Principles of Geology\" (the first) Lyell devised the terms Eocene, Miocene and Pliocene to mean periods of which the \"strata\" contained some (Eo-, \"early\"), lesser (Mio-) and greater (Plio-) numbers of \"living Mollusca represented among fossil assemblages of western Europe.\" The Eocene was given Lower, Middle, Upper; the Miocene a Lower and Upper; and the Pliocene an Older and Newer, which scheme would indicate an equivalence between Lower and Older, and Upper and Newer.\nIn a French version, , in 1839 Lyell called the Older Pliocene the Pliocene and the Newer Pliocene the Pleistocene (Pleist-, \"most\"). Then in \"Antiquity of Man\" in 1863 he reverted to his previous scheme, adding \"Post-Tertiary\" and \"Post-Pliocene\". In 1873 the Fourth Edition of \"Antiquity of Man\" restores Pleistocene and identifies it with Post-Pliocene. As this work was posthumous, no more was heard from Lyell. Living or deceased, his work was immensely popular among scientists and laymen alike. \"Pleistocene\" caught on immediately; it is entirely possible that he restored it by popular demand. In 1880 Dawkins published \"The Three Pleistocene Strata\" containing a new manifesto for British archaeology:\nThe continuity between geology, prehistoric archaeology and history is so direct that it is impossible to picture early man in this country without using the results of all these three sciences.\nHe intends to use archaeology and geology to \"draw aside the veil\" covering the situations of the peoples mentioned in proto-historic documents, such as Caesar's \"Commentaries\" and the \"Agricola\" of Tacitus. Adopting Lyell's scheme of the Tertiary, he divides Pleistocene into Early, Mid- and Late. Only the Palaeolithic falls into the Pleistocene; the Neolithic is in the \"Prehistoric Period\" subsequent. Dawkins defines what was to become the Upper, Middle and Lower Paleolithic, except that he calls them the \"Upper Cave-Earth and Breccia\", the \"Middle Cave-Earth\", and the \"Lower Red Sand\", with reference to the names of the layers. The next year, 1881, James Geikie solidified the terminology into Upper and Lower Palaeolithic:\nIn Kent's Cave the implements obtained from the lower stages were of a much ruder description than the various objects detected in the upper cave-earth ... And a very long time must have elapsed between the formation of the lower and upper Palaeolithic beds in that cave.\nThe Middle Paleolithic in the modern sense made its appearance in 1911 in the 1st edition of William Johnson Sollas' \"Ancient Hunters\". It had been used in varying senses before then. Sollas associates the period with the Mousterian technology and the relevant modern people with the Tasmanians. In the 2nd edition of 1915 he has changed his mind for reasons that are not clear. The Mousterian has been moved to the Lower Paleolithic and the people changed to the Australian aborigines; furthermore, the association has been made with Neanderthals and the Levalloisian added. Sollas says wistfully that they are in \"the very middle of the Palaeolithic epoch\". Whatever his reasons, the public would have none of it. From 1911 on, Mousterian was Middle Paleolithic, except for holdouts. Alfred L. Kroeber in 1920, \"Three essays on the antiquity and races of man\", reverting to Lower Paleolithic, explains that he is following Gabriel de Mortillet. The English-speaking public remained with Middle Paleolithic.\nEarly and late from Worsaae through the three-stage African system.\nThomsen had formalized the Three-age System by the time of its publication in 1836. The next step forward was the formalization of the Palaeolithic and Neolithic by Sir John Lubbock in 1865. Between these two times Denmark held the lead in archaeology, especially because of the work of Thomsen's at first junior associate and then successor, Jens Jacob Asmussen Worsaae, rising in the last year of his life to Kultus Minister of Denmark. Lubbock offers full tribute and credit to him in \"Prehistoric Times\".\nWorsaae in 1862 in \"Om Tvedelingen af Steenalderen\", previewed in English even before its publication by \"The Gentleman's Magazine\", concerned about changes in typology during each period, proposed a bipartite division of each age:Both for Bronze and Stone it was now evident that a few hundred years would not suffice. In fact, good grounds existed for dividing each of these periods into two, if not more.\nHe called them earlier or later. The three ages became six periods. The British seized on the concept immediately. Worsaae's earlier and later became Lubbock's palaeo- and neo- in 1865, but alternatively English speakers used Earlier and Later Stone Age, as did Lyell's 1883 edition of \"Principles of Geology\", with older and younger as synonyms. As there is no room for a middle between the comparative adjectives, they were later modified to early and late. The scheme created a problem for further bipartite subdivisions, which would have resulted in such terms as early early Stone Age, but that terminology was avoided by adoption of Geikie's upper and lower Paleolithic.\nAmongst African archaeologists, the terms Old Stone Age, Middle Stone Age and Late Stone Age are preferred.\nWallace's grand revolution recycled.\nWhen Sir John Lubbock was doing the preliminary work for his 1865 \"magnum opus\", Charles Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace were jointly publishing their first papers \"On the Tendency of Species to form Varieties; and on the Perpetuation of Varieties and Species by Natural Means of Selection\". Darwins's \"On the Origin of Species\" came out in 1859, but he did not elucidate the theory of evolution as it applies to man until the Descent of Man in 1871. Meanwhile, Wallace read a paper in 1864 to the Anthropological Society of London that was a major influence on Sir John, publishing in the very next year. He quoted Wallace:From the moment when the first skin was used as a covering, when the first rude spear was formed to assist in the chase, the first seed sown or shoot planted, a grand revolution was effected in nature, a revolution which in all the previous ages of the world's history had had no parallel, for a being had arisen who was no longer necessarily subject to change with the changing universe,\u2014a being who was in some degree superior to nature, inasmuch as he knew how to control and regulate her action, and could keep himself in harmony with her, not by a change in body, but by an advance in mind.\nWallace distinguishing between mind and body was asserting that natural selection shaped the form of man only until the appearance of mind; after then, it played no part. Mind formed modern man, meaning that result of mind, culture. Its appearance overthrew the laws of nature. Wallace used the term \"grand revolution\". Although Lubbock believed that Wallace had gone too far in that direction he did adopt a theory of evolution combined with the revolution of culture. Neither Wallace nor Lubbock offered any explanation of how the revolution came about, or felt that they had to offer one. Revolution is an acceptance that in the continuous evolution of objects and events sharp and inexplicable disconformities do occur, as in geology. And so it is not surprising that in the 1874 Stockholm meeting of the International Congress of Prehistoric Anthropology and Archaeology, in response to Ernst Hamy's denial of any \"break\" between Paleolithic and Neolithic based on material from dolmens near Paris \"showing a continuity between the paleolithic and neolithic folks,\" Edouard Desor, geologist and archaeologist, replied: \"that the introduction of domesticated animals was a complete revolution and enables us to separate the two epochs completely.\"\nA revolution as defined by Wallace and adopted by Lubbock is a change of regime, or rules. If man was the new rule-setter through culture then the initiation of each of Lubbock's four periods might be regarded as a change of rules and therefore as a distinct revolution, and so \"Chambers's Journal\", a reference work, in 1879 portrayed each of them as:...an advance in knowledge and civilization which amounted to a revolution in the then existing manners and customs of the world.\nBecause of the controversy over Westropp's Mesolithic and Mortillet's Gap beginning in 1872 archaeological attention focused mainly on the revolution at the Palaeolithic\u2013Neolithic boundary as an explanation of the gap. For a few decades the Neolithic Period, as it was called, was described as a kind of revolution. In the 1890s, a standard term, the Neolithic Revolution, began to appear in encyclopedias such as Pears. In 1925 the Cambridge Ancient History reported:There are quite a large number of archaeologists who justifiably consider the period of the Late Stone Age to be a Neolithic revolution and an economic revolution at the same time. For that is the period when primitive agriculture developed and cattle breeding began.\nVere Gordon Childe's revolution for the masses.\nIn 1936 a champion came forward who would advance the Neolithic Revolution into the mainstream view: Vere Gordon Childe. After giving the Neolithic Revolution scant mention in his first notable work, the 1928 edition of \"New Light on the Most Ancient East\", Childe made a major presentation in the first edition of \"Man Makes Himself\" in 1936 developing Wallace's and Lubbock's theme of the human revolution against the supremacy of nature and supplying detail on two revolutions, the Paleolithic\u2013Neolithic and the Neolithic\u2013Bronze Age, which he called the Second or Urban revolution.\nLubbock had been as much of an ethnologist as an archaeologist. The founders of cultural anthropology, such as Tylor and Morgan, were to follow his lead on that. Lubbock created such concepts as savages and barbarians based on the customs of then modern tribesmen and made the presumption that the terms can be applied without serious inaccuracy to the men of the Paleolithic and the Neolithic. Childe broke with this view:\nThe assumption that any savage tribe today is primitive, in the sense that its culture faithfully reflects that of much more ancient men is gratuitous.\nChilde concentrated on the inferences to be made from the artifacts:\nBut when the tools ... are considered ... in their totality, they may reveal much more. They disclose not only the level of technical skill ... but also their economy ... The archaeologists's ages correspond roughly to economic stages. Each new \"age\" is ushered in by an economic revolution ...\nThe archaeological periods were indications of economic ones:\nArchaeologists can define a period when it was apparently the sole economy, the sole organization of production ruling anywhere on the earth's surface.\nThese periods could be used to supplement historical ones where history was not available. He reaffirmed Lubbock's view that the Paleolithic was an age of food gathering and the Neolithic an age of food production. He took a stand on the question of the Mesolithic identifying it with the Epipaleolithic. The Mesolithic was to him \"a mere continuance of the Old Stone Age mode of life\" between the end of the Pleistocene and the start of the Neolithic. Lubbock's terms \"savagery\" and \"barbarism\" do not much appear in \"Man Makes Himself\" but the sequel, \"What Happened in History\" (1942), reuses them (attributing them to Morgan, who got them from Lubbock) with an economic significance: savagery for food-gathering and barbarism for Neolithic food production. Civilization begins with the urban revolution of the Bronze Age.\nThe Pre-pottery Neolithic of Garstang and Kenyon at Jericho.\nEven as Childe was developing this revolution theme the ground was sinking under him. Lubbock did not find any pottery associated with the Paleolithic, asserting of its to him last period, the Reindeer, \"no fragments of metal or pottery have yet been found.\" He did not generalize but others did not hesitate to do so. The next year, 1866, Dawkins proclaimed of Neolithic people that \"these invented the use of pottery...\" From then until the 1930s pottery was considered a sine qua non of the Neolithic. The term Pre-Pottery Age came into use in the late 19th century but it meant Paleolithic.\nMeanwhile, the Palestine Exploration Fund founded in 1865 completing its survey of excavatable sites in Palestine in 1880 began excavating in 1890 at the site of ancient Lachish near Jerusalem, the first of a series planned under the licensing system of the Ottoman Empire. Under their auspices in 1908 Ernst Sellin and Carl Watzinger began excavation at Jericho (Tell es-Sultan) previously excavated for the first time by Sir Charles Warren in 1868. They discovered a Neolithic and Bronze Age city there. Subsequent excavations in the region by them and others turned up other walled cities that appear to have preceded the Bronze Age urbanization.\nAll excavation ceased for World War I. When it was over the Ottoman Empire was no longer a factor there. In 1919 the new British School of Archaeology in Jerusalem assumed archaeological operations in Palestine. John Garstang finally resumed excavation at Jericho 1930\u20131936. The renewed dig uncovered another 3000 years of prehistory that was in the Neolithic but did not make use of pottery. He called it the Pre-pottery Neolithic, as opposed to the Pottery Neolithic, subsequently often called the Aceramic or Pre-ceramic and Ceramic Neolithic.\nKathleen Kenyon was a young photographer then with a natural talent for archaeology. Solving a number of dating problems she soon advanced to the forefront of British archaeology through skill and judgement. In World War II she served as a commander in the Red Cross. In 1952\u20131958 she took over operations at Jericho as the Director of the British School, verifying and expanding Garstang's work and conclusions. There were two Pre-pottery Neolithic periods, she concluded, A and B. Moreover, the PPN had been discovered at most of the major Neolithic sites in the near East and Greece. By this time her personal stature in archaeology was at least equal to that of V. Gordon Childe. While the three-age system was being attributed to Childe in popular fame, Kenyon became gratuitously the discoverer of the PPN. More significantly the question of revolution or evolution of the Neolithic was increasingly being brought before the professional archaeologists.\nBronze Age subdivisions.\nDanish archaeology took the lead in defining the Bronze Age, with little of the controversy surrounding the Stone Age. British archaeologists patterned their own excavations after those of the Danish, which they followed avidly in the media. References to the Bronze Age in British excavation reports began in the 1820s contemporaneously with the new system being promulgated by C. J. Thomsen. Mention of the Early and Late Bronze Age began in the 1860s following the bipartite definitions of Worsaae.\nThe tripartite system of Sir John Evans.\nIn 1874 at the Stockholm meeting of the International Congress of Anthropology and Prehistoric Archaeology, a suggestion was made by A. Bertrand that no distinct age of bronze had existed, that the bronze artifacts discovered were really part of the Iron Age. Hans Hildebrand in refutation pointed to two Bronze Ages and a transitional period in Scandinavia. John Evans denied any defect of continuity between the two and asserted there were three Bronze Ages, \"the early, middle and late Bronze Age\".\nHis view for the Stone Age, following Lubbock, was quite different, denying, in \"The Ancient Stone Implements\", any concept of a Middle Stone Age. In his 1881 parallel work, \"The Ancient Bronze Implements\", he affirmed and further defined the three periods, strangely enough recusing himself from his previous terminology, Early, Middle and Late Bronze Age (the current forms) in favor of \"an earlier and later stage\" and \"middle\". He uses Bronze Age, Bronze Period, Bronze-using Period and Bronze Civilization interchangeably. Apparently Evans was sensitive of what had gone before, retaining the terminology of the bipartite system while proposing a tripartite one. After stating a catalogue of types of bronze implements he defines his system:The Bronze Age of Britain may, therefore, be regarded as an aggregate of three stages: the first, that characterized by the flat or slightly flanged celts, and the knife-daggers ... the second, that characterized by the more heavy dagger-blades and the flanged celts and tanged spear-heads or daggers, ... and the third, by palstaves and socketed celts and the many forms of tools and weapons, ... It is in this third stage that the bronze sword and the true socketed spear-head first make their advent.\nCopper Age or Chalcolithic.\nIn chapter 1 of his work, Evans proposes for the first time a transitional Copper Age between the Neolithic and the Bronze Age. He adduces evidence from far-flung places such as China and the Americas to show that the smelting of copper universally preceded alloying with tin to make bronze. He does not know how to classify this fourth age. On the one hand he distinguishes it from the Bronze Age. On the other hand, he includes it:In thus speaking of a bronze-using period I by no means wish to exclude the possible use of copper unalloyed with tin.\nEvans goes into considerable detail tracing references to the metals in classical literature: Latin \"aer, aeris\" and Greek \"\" first for \"copper\" and then for \"bronze\". He does not mention the adjective of \"aes\", which is \"a\u0113neus\", nor is he interested in formulating New Latin words for the Copper Age, which is good enough for him and a number of English authors from then on. He offers literary proof that bronze had been in use before iron and copper before bronze.\nIn 1884 the center of archaeological interest shifted to Italy with the excavation of Remedello and the discovery of the Remedello culture by Gaetano Chierici. According to his 1886 biographers, Luigi Pigorini and Pellegrino Strobel, Chierici devised the term Et\u00e0 Eneo-litica to describe the archaeological context of his findings, which he believed were the remains of Pelasgians, or people that preceded Greek and Latin speakers in the Mediterranean. The age (Et\u00e0) was:A period of transition from the age of stone to that of bronze (periodo di transizione dall'et\u00e0 della pietra a quella del bronzo)\nWhether intentional or not, the definition was the same as Evans', except that Chierici was adding a term to New Latin. He describes the transition by stating the beginning (litica, or Stone Age) and the ending (eneo-, or Bronze Age); in English, \"the stone-to-bronze period\". Shortly after, \"Eneolithic\" or \"Aeneolithic\" began turning up in scholarly English as a synonym for \"Copper Age\". Sir John's own son, Arthur Evans, beginning to come into his own as an archaeologist and already studying Cretan civilization, refers in 1895 to some clay figures of \"aeneolithic date\" (quotes his).\nEnd of the Iron Age.\nThe three-age system is a way of dividing prehistory, and the Iron Age is therefore considered to end in a particular culture with either the start of its protohistory, when it begins to be written about by outsiders, or when its own historiography begins. Although iron is still the major hard material in use in modern civilization, and steel is a vital and indispensable modern industry, as far as archaeologists are concerned the Iron Age has therefore now ended for all cultures in the world.\nThe date when it is taken to end varies between cultures, and in multiple parts of the world there was no Iron Age at all, for example in Pre-Columbian America and the prehistory of Australia. For these regions the three-age system is uncommon. By convention among archaeologists:\nDating.\nThe question of the dates of the objects and events discovered through archaeology is the prime concern of any system of thought that seeks to summarize history through the formulation of ages or epochs. An age is defined through comparison of contemporaneous events. Increasingly, the terminology of archaeology is parallel to that of historical method. An event is \"undocumented\" until it turns up in the archaeological record. Fossils and artifacts are \"documents\" of the epochs hypothesized. The correction of dating errors is therefore a major concern.\nIn the case where parallel epochs defined in history were available, elaborate efforts were made to align European and Near Eastern sequences with the datable chronology of Ancient Egypt and other known civilizations. The resulting grand sequence was also spot checked by evidence of calculateable solar or other astronomical events. These methods are only available for the relatively short term of recorded history. Most prehistory does not fall into that category.\nPhysical science provides at least two general groups of dating methods, stated below. Data collected by these methods is intended to provide an absolute chronology to the framework of periods defined by relative chronology.\nGrand systems of layering.\nThe initial comparisons of artifacts defined periods that were local to a site, group of sites or region.\nAdvances made in the fields of seriation, typology, stratification and the associative dating of artifacts and features permitted even greater refinement of the system. The ultimate development is the reconstruction of a global catalogue of layers (or as close to it as possible) with different sections attested in different regions. Ideally once the layer of the artifact or event is known a quick lookup of the layer in the grand system will provide a ready date. This is considered the most reliable method. It is used for calibration of the less reliable chemical methods.\nMeasurement of chemical change.\nAny material sample contains elements and compounds that are subject to decay into other elements and compounds. In cases where the rate of decay is predictable and the proportions of initial and end products can be known exactly, consistent dates of the artifact can be calculated. Due to the problem of sample contamination and variability of the natural proportions of the materials in the media, sample analysis in the case where verification can be checked by grand layering systems has often been found to be widely inaccurate. Chemical dates therefore are only considered reliable used in conjunction with other methods. They are collected in groups of data points that form a pattern when graphed. Isolated dates are not considered reliable.\nThree-age system resumptive table.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Stacked bar/styles.css\" /&gt;\n\"&gt;Stone Age\"&gt;Bronze Age\"&gt;Iron Age\nCriticism.\nThe Three-age System has been criticized since at least the 19th century. Every phase of its development has been contested. Some of the arguments that have been presented against it follow.\nUnsound epochalism.\nIn some cases criticism resulted in other, parallel three-age systems, such as the concepts expressed by Lewis Henry Morgan in \"Ancient Society\", based on ethnology. These disagreed with the metallic basis of epochization. The critic generally substituted his own definitions of epochs. Vere Gordon Childe said of the early cultural anthropologists:Last century Herbert Spencer, Lewis H. Morgan and Tylor propounded divergent schemes ... they arranged these in a logical order ... They assumed that the logical order was a temporal one... The competing systems of Morgan and Tylor remained equally unverified \u2013 and incompatible \u2013 theories.\nMore recently, some archaeologists have questioned the validity of dividing time into epochs at all. For example, one recent critic, Graham Connah, describes the three-age system as \"epochalism\" and asserts:So many archaeological writers have used this model for so long that for many readers it has taken on a reality of its own. In spite of the theoretical agonizing of the last half-century, epochalism is still alive and well ... Even in parts of the world where the model is still in common use, it needs to be accepted that, for example, there never was actually such a thing as 'the Bronze Age.'\nOver-simplification.\nSome view the three-age system as overly simple; that is, it neglects vital detail and forces complex circumstances into a mold they do not fit. Rowlands argues that the division of human societies into epochs based on the presumption of a single set of related changes is not realistic:But as a more rigorous sociological approach has begun to show that changes at the economic, political and ideological levels are not 'all of apiece' we have come to realise that time may be segmented in as many ways as convenient to the researcher concerned.\nThe three-age system is a relative chronology. The explosion of archaeological data acquired in the 20th century was intended to elucidate the relative chronology in detail. One consequence was the collection of absolute dates. Connah argues:As radiocarbon and other forms of absolute dating contributed more detailed and more reliable chronologies, the epochal model ceased to be necessary.\nPeter Bogucki of Princeton University summarizes the perspective taken by a number of modern archaeologists:\nAlthough modern archaeologists realize that this tripartite division of prehistoric society is far too simple to reflect the complexity of change and continuity, terms like 'Bronze Age' are still used as a very general way of focusing attention on particular times and places and thus facilitating archaeological discussion.\nEurocentrism.\nAnother common criticism attacks the broader application of the three-age system as a cross-cultural model for social change. The model was originally designed to explain data from Europe and West Asia, but archaeologists have also attempted to use it to explain social and technological developments in other parts of the world such as the Americas, Australasia, and Africa. A number of archaeologists working in these regions have criticized this application as eurocentric. Graham Connah writes that:\n... attempts by Eurocentric archaeologists to apply the model to African archaeology have produced little more than confusion, whereas in the Americas or Australasia it has been irrelevant, ...\nAlice B. Kehoe further explains this position as it relates to American archaeology:\n... Professor Wilson's presentation of prehistoric archaeology was a European product carried across the Atlantic to promote an American science compatible with its European model.\nKehoe goes on to complain of Wilson that \"he accepted and reprised the idea that the European course of development was paradigmatic for humankind.\" This criticism argues that the different societies of the world underwent social and technological developments in different ways. A sequence of events that describes the developments of one civilization may not necessarily apply to another, in this view. Instead social and technological developments must be described within the context of the society being studied.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "31296", "revid": "6200168", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31296", "title": "Tachyon", "text": "Hypothetical faster-than-light particle\nA tachyon () or tachyonic particle is a hypothetical particle that always travels faster than light. Physicists posit that faster-than-light particles cannot exist because they are inconsistent with the known laws of physics. If such particles did exist they perhaps could be used to send signals faster than light and into the past. According to the theory of relativity this would violate causality, leading to logical paradoxes such as the grandfather paradox. Tachyons would exhibit the unusual property of increasing in speed as their energy decreases, and would require infinite energy to slow to the speed of light. No verifiable experimental evidence for the existence of such particles has been found.\nThe term \"tachyon\" derives from a 1967 paper by Gerald Feinberg about excitations of a quantum field with imaginary mass. Subsequent work has shown the excitations are not faster than light particles but particle physicists still discuss \"tachyons\", e.g. in tachyon condensation, when they are referring to tachyonic fields.\nEtymology.\nThe term \"tachyon\" comes from the , \"tachus\", meaning \"swift\". The complementary particle types are called luxons (which always move at the speed of light) and bradyons (which always move slower than light); both of these particle types are known to exist.\nHistory.\nFaster-than-light particles were discussed before the advent of relativity by such physicists as JJ Thomson and Arnold Sommerfeld. The possibility of existence of faster-than-light particles was also proposed by Lev Yakovlevich Shtrum in 1923.\nIn 1962 and again in 1969 Oleksa-Myron Bilanuik, Vijay Deshpande and E. C. George Sudarshan discussed the possibility of a class of faster-than-light particles consistent with special relativity. As part of their discussion they point out that light particles are never accelerated but rather are created with the full velocity of light. Similarly they argue that while accelerating normal matter beyond the speed of light is inconsistent with special relativity, this does not prevent creation of faster than light particles. \nThe term \"tachyon\" was coined by Gerald Feinberg in a 1967 paper titled \"Possibility of faster-than-light particles\". He proposed that tachyonic particles could be made from excitations of a quantum field with imaginary mass. He had been inspired by the science-fiction story \"Beep\" by James Blish. Feinberg studied the kinematics of such particles according to special relativity. In his paper, he also introduced fields with imaginary mass (now also referred to as tachyons) in an attempt to understand the microphysical origin such particles might have. It was soon realized that Feinberg's model did not in fact allow for superluminal (faster than light) particles or signals and that tachyonic fields merely give rise to instabilities, not causality violations. The term tachyonic field refers to imaginary mass fields rather than to faster-than-light particles.\nIn September 2011, it was reported that a tau neutrino had traveled faster than the speed of light; however, later updates from CERN on the OPERA experiment indicate that the faster-than-light readings were due to a faulty element of the experiment's fibre optic timing system.\nSpecial relativity.\nIn special relativity, a faster-than-light particle would have spacelike four-momentum, unlike ordinary particles that have time-like four-momentum. While some theories suggest the mass of tachyons is imaginary, modern formulations often consider their mass to be real, with redefined formulas for momentum and energy. Additionally, since tachyons are confined to the spacelike portion of the energy\u2013momentum graph, they cannot slow down to subluminal (slower-than-light) speeds.\nMass.\nIn a Lorentz invariant theory, the same formulas that apply to ordinary slower-than-light particles (sometimes called bradyons in discussions of tachyons) must also apply to tachyons. In particular, the energy\u2013momentum relation:\nformula_1\n(where p is the relativistic momentum of the bradyon and m is its rest mass) should still apply, along with the formula for the total energy of a particle:\nformula_2\nThis equation shows that the total energy of a particle (bradyon or tachyon) contains a contribution from its rest mass (the \"rest mass\u2013energy\") and a contribution from its motion, the kinetic energy. When formula_3 (the particle's velocity) is larger than formula_4 (the speed of light), the denominator in the equation for the energy is imaginary, as the value under the square root is negative. Because the total energy of the particle must be real (and not a complex or imaginary number) in order to have any practical meaning as a measurement, the numerator must \"also\" be imaginary (i.e. the rest mass \"m\" must be imaginary, as a pure imaginary number divided by another pure imaginary number is a real number).\nIn some modern formulations of the theory, the mass of tachyons is regarded as real.\nSpeed.\nOne curious effect is that, unlike ordinary particles, the speed of a tachyon \"increases\" as its energy decreases. In particular, formula_5 approaches zero when formula_3 approaches infinity. (For ordinary bradyonic matter, \"formula_5\" increases with increasing speed, becoming arbitrarily large as \"formula_3\" approaches formula_4, the speed of light.) Therefore, just as bradyons are forbidden to break the light-speed barrier, so are tachyons forbidden from slowing down to below \"c\", because infinite energy is required to reach the barrier from either above or below.\nAs noted by Albert Einstein, Richard C. Tolman, and others, special relativity implies that faster-than-light particles, if they existed, could be used to communicate backwards in time.\nNeutrinos.\nIn 1985, Chodos proposed that neutrinos can have a tachyonic nature. The possibility of standard model particles moving at faster-than-light speeds can be modeled using Lorentz invariance violating terms, for example in the Standard-Model Extension. In this framework, neutrinos experience Lorentz-violating oscillations and can travel faster than light at high energies. This proposal was strongly criticized.\nSuperluminal information.\nIf tachyons can transmit information faster than light, then, according to relativity, they violate causality, leading to logical paradoxes of the \"kill your own grandfather\" type. This is often illustrated with thought experiments such as the \"tachyon telephone paradox\" or \"logically pernicious self-inhibitor.\"\nThe problem can be understood in terms of the relativity of simultaneity in special relativity, which says that different inertial reference frames will disagree on whether two events at different locations happened \"at the same time\" or not, and they can also disagree on the order of the two events. (Technically, these disagreements occur when the spacetime interval between the events is 'space-like', meaning that neither event lies in the future light cone of the other.)\nIf one of the two events represents the sending of a signal from one location and the second event represents the reception of the same signal at another location, then, as long as the signal is moving at the speed of light or slower, the mathematics of simultaneity ensures that all reference frames agree that the transmission-event happened before the reception-event. However, in the case of a hypothetical signal moving faster than light, there would always be some frames in which the signal was received before it was sent, so that the signal could be said to have moved backward in time. Because one of the two fundamental postulates of special relativity says that the laws of physics should work the same way in every inertial frame, if it is possible for signals to move backward in time in any one frame, it must be possible in all frames. This means that if observer A sends a signal to observer B which moves faster than light in A's frame but backwards in time in B's frame, and then B sends a reply which moves faster than light in B's frame but backwards in time in A's frame, it could work out that A receives the reply before sending the original signal, challenging causality in \"every\" frame and opening the door to severe logical paradoxes. This is known as the tachyonic antitelephone.\nReinterpretation principle.\nThe reinterpretation principle asserts that a tachyon sent \"back\" in time can always be \"reinterpreted\" as a tachyon traveling \"forward\" in time, because observers cannot distinguish between the emission and absorption of tachyons. The attempt to \"detect\" a tachyon \"from\" the future (and violate causality) would actually \"create\" the same tachyon and send it \"forward\" in time (which is causal).\nHowever, this principle is not widely accepted as resolving the paradoxes. Instead, what would be required to avoid paradoxes is that, unlike any known particle, tachyons do not interact in any way and can never be detected or observed, because otherwise a tachyon beam could be modulated and used to create an anti-telephone or a \"logically pernicious self-inhibitor\". All forms of energy are positted to interact at least gravitationally, and many authors state that superluminal propagation in Lorentz invariant theories always leads to causal paradoxes.\nFundamental models.\nIn modern physics, all fundamental particles are regarded as excitations of quantum fields. There are several distinct ways in which tachyonic particles could be embedded into a field theory.\nFields with imaginary mass.\nIn the paper that coined the term \"tachyon\", Gerald Feinberg studied Lorentz invariant quantum fields with imaginary mass. Because the group velocity for such a field is superluminal, naively it appears that its excitations propagate faster than light. However, it was quickly understood that the superluminal group velocity does not correspond to the speed of propagation of any localized excitation (like a particle). Instead, the negative mass represents an instability to tachyon condensation, and all excitations of the field propagate subluminally and are consistent with causality. Despite having no faster-than-light propagation, such fields are referred to simply as \"tachyons\" in many sources.\nTachyonic fields play an important role in modern physics. Perhaps the most famous is the Higgs boson of the Standard Model of particle physics, which has an imaginary mass in its uncondensed phase. In general, the phenomenon of spontaneous symmetry breaking, which is closely related to tachyon condensation, plays an important role in many aspects of theoretical physics, including the Ginzburg\u2013Landau and BCS theories of superconductivity. Another example of a tachyonic field is the tachyon of bosonic string theory.\nTachyons are predicted by bosonic string theory and also the Neveu-Schwarz (NS) and NS-NS sectors, which are respectively the open bosonic sector and closed bosonic sector, of RNS superstring theory prior to the GSO projection. However such tachyons are not possible due to the Sen conjecture, also known as tachyon condensation. This resulted in the necessity for the GSO projection.\nLorentz-violating theories.\nIn theories that do not respect Lorentz invariance, the speed of light is not (necessarily) a barrier, and particles can travel faster than the speed of light without infinite energy or causal paradoxes. A class of field theories of that type is the so-called Standard Model extensions. However, the experimental evidence for Lorentz invariance is extremely good, so such theories are very tightly constrained.\nFields with non-canonical kinetic term.\nBy modifying the kinetic term of the field, it is possible to produce Lorentz invariant field theories with excitations that propagate superluminally. However, such theories, in general, do not have a well-defined Cauchy problem (for reasons related to the issues of causality discussed above), and are probably inconsistent quantum mechanically.\nIn fiction.\nTachyons have appeared in many works of fiction. They have been used as a standby mechanism upon which many science fiction authors rely to establish faster-than-light communication, with or without reference to causality issues. The word \"tachyon\" has become widely recognized to such an extent that it can impart a science-fictional connotation even if the subject in question has no particular relation to superluminal travel (a form of technobabble, akin to \"positronic brain\").\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The show's setting is a huge generational colony spacecraft called \"Earthship Ark\", which following an unspecified accident has gone off course. Centuries after its original launch however, most of the descendants of the original crew and colonists are unaware that they are even aboard a spaceship. The series experienced a number of production difficulties, and Ellison broke with the project before the airing of its first episode.\nPremise.\nForeseeing the destruction of Earth, humanity builds a multi-generational starship called \"Earthship Ark\", wide and long. The ship contains dozens of biospheres, each kilometres across and housing people of different cultures. Their goal is to find and seed a new world of a distant star. In 2385, more than 100 years into the voyage, an unexplained accident occurs, and the ship goes into emergency mode in which each biosphere is sealed off from the others.\nIn 2790, 405 years after the accident, Devon (Keir Dullea) a resident of Cypress Corners, an agrarian community with a culture resembling that of the Amish, discovers that his world is far larger and more mysterious than he had realized. Considered an outcast because of his questioning of the way things are, especially his refusal to accept the arranged marriage of his love Rachel (Gay Rowan) to his friend Garth (Robin Ward), Devon finds out that the Cypress Corners elders have been deliberately manipulating the local computer terminal, which they call \"The Voice of The Creator\". The congregation pursues Devon for attacking the elders and stealing a computer cassette on which they have recorded their orders, and its leaders plot to execute him, but the elderly Abraham, who also questions the elders, gives Devon a key to a dark mysterious doorway, which Abraham himself is afraid to enter. The frightened Devon escapes into the service areas of the ship and accesses a computer data station, which explains the nature and the purpose of the Ark and hints at its problems.\nWhen Devon returns to Cypress Corners to tell his community what he has learned, he is put on trial for heresy and condemned to death by stoning. Escaping on the night before his execution with the aid of Garth, Devon convinces Rachel to come with him, and Garth pursues them. When Rachel refuses to return with Garth, he joins her and Devon. Eventually they make their way to the ship's bridge, containing the skeletal remains of its crew. It is badly damaged, and its control systems are inoperative. The three discover that the Ark is on a collision course with a Class G star similar to the Sun and realize that the only way to save the Ark and its passengers is to find the backup bridge at the other end of the Ark and to reactivate the navigation and propulsion systems.\nGetting to the other end of the Ark, which is potentially hundreds of miles away, involves traveling through the many disparate communities on the starship, some of which are hostile to outsiders, and all of which have different social customs, belief systems and law enforcement practices. Generally, each episode will have Devon, Rachel, and Garth encountering a new society or group as they work their way through the ship. Occasionally, they are aided (or hindered) in their travels by the ship's frustrating and only partially-functioning computer system interface, known as Mu Lambda 165 (portrayed by William Osler, who also provided the opening narration for each episode).\nDevelopment and production.\n20th Century Fox was involved in the project with Douglas Trumbull as executive producer. The science fiction writer and editor Ben Bova was brought in as science advisor.\nHarlan Ellison was approached by Robert Kline, a 20th Century Fox television producer, to come up with an idea for a science fiction TV series consisting of eight episodes, to pitch to the BBC as a co-production in February 1973. The BBC rejected the idea. Unable to sell \"The Starlost\" for prime time, Kline decided to pursue a low budget approach and produce it for syndication. By May, Kline had sold the idea to 48 NBC stations and the Canadian CTV network.\nEllison claimed that to get Canadian government subsidies, the production was shot in Canada, and Canadian writers produced the scripts from story outlines by Ellison. However, several produced episodes were written entirely by American writers.\nBefore Ellison could begin work on the show's production bible, a writers' strike began, running from March 6 to June 24. Kline negotiated an exception with the Writer's Guild, on the grounds that the production was wholly Canadian\u00a0\u2013 and Ellison went to work on a bible for the series.\nOriginally, the show was to be filmed with a special effects camera system developed by Doug Trumbull called Magicam. The system comprised two cameras, the motion of which was controlled by servos. One camera would film actors against a blue screen, and the other would shoot a model background. The motion of both cameras was synchronized and scaled appropriately, allowing both the camera and the actors to move through model sets. The technology did not work reliably, however. In the end, simple blue screen effects were used, which forced static camera shots.\nThe failure of the Magicam system was a major blow, as the Canadian studio space that had been rented was too small to build the required sets. In the end, partial sets were built, but the lack of space hampered production.\nAs the filming went on, Ellison grew disenchanted with the budget cuts, details that were changed, and what he characterized as a progressive dumbing down of the story. Ellison's dissatisfaction extended to the new title of the pilot episode; he had titled it \"Phoenix without Ashes\" but it was changed to \"Voyage of Discovery\".\nBefore the production of the pilot episode was completed, Ellison invoked a clause in his contract to force the producers to use his alternative registered writer's name of \"Cordwainer Bird\" on the end credits.\nSixteen episodes were made. Fox decided not to pick up the options for the remainder of the series.\nReception and impact.\nOn March 31, 1974, Ellison received a Writers Guild of America Award for Best Original Screenplay for the original script (the pilot script as originally written, not the version that was filmed). A novelization of the script by Edward Bryant, \"Phoenix Without Ashes\", was published in 1975 and contained a lengthy foreword by Ellison describing what had gone on in production. In 2010, the novel was adapted into comic book form by IDW Publishing.\nBen Bova, in an editorial in \"Analog Science Fiction\" (June 1974) and in interviews in fanzines, made it clear how disgruntled he had been as science adviser. In 1975, he published a novel entitled \"The Starcrossed\", depicting a scientist taken on as a science adviser for a terrible science fiction series.\nFrom contemporary reviews, Michael Walsh in \"The Province\" commented on the first episode, writing that he found the model work on the show impressive while concluding it was \"written, directed, acted, lit, photographed, recorded and edited like a church basement production\".\n\"The Starlost\" has received a generally negative reception from historians of science fiction television: \"The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction\" described \"The Starlost\" as \"dire\", while \"The Best of Science Fiction TV\" included \"The Starlost\" in its list of the \"Worst Science Fiction Shows of All Time\".\nEpisodes.\nThe \"Starlog Photo Guidebook TV Episode Guides Volume 1\" (1981) lists two unfilmed episodes, \"God That Died\" and \"People in the Dark.\" The latter episode, written by George Salverson, follows Devon, Rachel, and Garth as they discover a dome in which people have been living in the dark since the accident to the Ark.\nEpisodes of the original series were rebroadcast in 1978 and further in 1982. A number of episodes were also edited together to create movie-length installments that were sold to cable television broadcasters in the late 1980s.\nCommercial releases.\nAll 16 episodes were at one time available in a VHS boxed set.\nThe first DVD release was limited to the five feature-length edited versions.\nIn September/October 2008, the full series was released on DVD by VCI Entertainment. Aside from the digitally remastered episodes, a \"presentation reel\" created for potential broadcasters is also included. Hosted by Dullea and Trumbull, and predating Ellison's departure as he is credited under his own name with creating the series, the short feature includes sample footage using the later-abandoned Magicam technology, some filmed special effects footage taken from other productions along with model footage from the film \"Silent Running\" to represent the \"Earthship Ark\" concept, and a different series logo.\nIn early 2019, a Roku channel began airing \"The Starlost\" as its only program.\nSee also.\nSimilar themes:"}

It is situated in the Pachir Aw Agam District of Nangarhar, approximately west of the Khyber Pass and north of the border of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province in Pakistan. Tora Bora and the surrounding Spin Ghar range had natural caverns formed by streams eating into the limestone, that had later been expanded into a CIA-financed complex built for the Afghan mujahideen. Tora Bora was known to be a stronghold location of the Afghan mujahideen, used by military forces against the Soviet Union during the 1980s.\nGeology.\nThe geology of Tora Bora is predominantly metamorphic gneiss and schist.\nHistory.\nMilitary base.\nIn October and November 1980, during Operation \"Shkval\", this complex was taken by the \"Kaskad\" special forces unit of the USSR KGB, together with the 66th motorized rifle brigade of the 40th Army of the Soviet troops in Afghanistan. As Colonel Valentin Gerasimenko wrote about the first assault, \u201cBy that time, Tora Bora was still a little-known, but already covered with a veil of mystery, the base of the Dushmans. Only later will it surpass the Panjshir Valley in its glory and fame, in the number of assaults and destruction\u201d.\nJune 18\u201319, 1981 - in the province of Nangarhar, 85\u00a0km south of Jalalabad, in the area of the Afghan-Pakistani border, units of the Soviet 66th motorized rifle brigade and part of the Afghan 11th Jalalabad infantry division take the fortified area of the Mujahideen Tora Bora.\nJuly 22\u201329, 1983 - operation in Tora-Bora of the 66th motorized rifle brigade.\nThe base at Tora Bora was developed as a CIA-financed complex built for the Mujahideen following the 1979 Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, and has been described by the western media as an \"impregnable cave fortress\" housing 2,000 men complete with a hospital, a hydroelectric power plant, offices, a hotel, arms and ammunition stores, roads large enough to drive a tank into, and sophisticated tunnel and ventilation systems.\nDuring the U.S. invasion of Afghanistan, the cave complex was one of the strongholds of the Taliban and Al-Qaeda, according to United States Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld. It was the location of the December 2001 Battle of Tora Bora, and suspected hideout of Al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden which led his escape into neighboring Pakistan in January 2002. Bin Laden and his family moved to a new compound in the village of Chak Shah Muhammad, a wealthy suburb of Bilal Town near Abbottabad on 6 January 2006. It was reported that in 2007, U.S. intelligence suspected bin Laden planned to meet with top Al-Qaeda and Taliban commanders at Tora Bora prior to the launch of a possible attack on Europe or the United States.\nBoth the British and American press published detailed plans of the base. When shown a plan during an NBC interview, Rumsfeld said, \"This is serious business; there's not one of those, there are many of those\".\nAn elaborate military operation was planned which included deployment of the CIA-US Special Operations Forces team with laser markers to guide non-stop heavy air strikes during 72 hours. When Tora Bora was eventually captured by the U.S. and Afghan troops, no traces of the supposed \"fortress\" were found despite painstaking searches in the surrounding areas. Tora Bora turned out to be a system of small natural caves housing, at most, 200 fighters. While arms and ammunition stores were found, there were no traces of the advanced facilities claimed to exist.\nIn a 2002 interview with by PBS's \"Frontline\", a Staff Sergeant from the U.S. Special Forces Operational Detachment Alpha (ODA) 572 described the caves:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Again, with the caves, they weren't these crazy mazes or labyrinths of caves that they described. Most of them were natural caves. Some were supported with some pieces of wood maybe about the size of a 10-foot by 24-foot room, at the largest. They weren't real big. I know they made a spectacle out of that, and how are we going to be able to get into them? We worried about that too, because we see all these reports. Then it turns out, when you actually go up there, there's really just small bunkers, and a lot of different ammo storage is up there. \u2013 Jeff, Staff Sgt. ODA 572\nThe complex later was retaken by the Taliban, and served as an important base for the Taliban insurgency. In 2017, Tora Bora was attacked and captured by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant \u2013 Khorasan Province (ISIL-K), though the Afghan National Army soon recaptured it.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The taiga, or boreal forest, is the world's largest land biome. In North America, it covers most of inland Canada, Alaska, and parts of the northern contiguous United States. In Eurasia, it covers most of Sweden, Finland, much of Russia from Karelia in the west to the Pacific Ocean (including much of Siberia), much of Norway and Estonia, some of the Scottish Highlands, some lowland/coastal areas of Iceland, and areas of northern Kazakhstan, northern Mongolia, and northern Japan (on the island of Hokkaido).\nThe principal tree species, depending on the length of the growing season and summer temperatures, vary across the world. The taiga of North America is mostly spruce; Scandinavian and Finnish taiga consists of a mix of spruce, pines and birch; Russian taiga has spruces, pines and larches depending on the region; and the Eastern Siberian taiga is a vast larch forest.\nTaiga in its current form is a relatively recent phenomenon, having only existed for the last 12,000 years since the beginning of the Holocene epoch, covering land that had been mammoth steppe or under the Scandinavian Ice Sheet in Eurasia and under the Laurentide Ice Sheet in North America during the Late Pleistocene.\nAlthough at high elevations taiga grades into alpine tundra through Krummholz, it is not exclusively an alpine biome, and unlike subalpine forest, much of taiga is lowlands.\nThe term \"taiga\" is not used consistently by all cultures. In the English language, \"boreal forest\" is used in the United States and Canada in referring to more southerly regions, while \"taiga\" is used to describe the more northern, barren areas approaching the tree line and the tundra. Hoffman (1958) discusses the origin of this differential use in North America and how this differentiation distorts established Russian usage.\nClimate change is a threat to taiga, and how the carbon dioxide absorbed or emitted should be treated by carbon accounting is controversial.\nClimate and geography.\nTaiga covers or 11.5% of the Earth's land area, second only to deserts and xeric shrublands. The largest areas are located in Russia and Canada. In Sweden taiga is associated with the Norrland terrain.\nTemperature.\nAfter the permanent ice caps and tundra, taiga is the terrestrial biome with the lowest annual average temperatures, with mean annual temperature generally varying from . Extreme winter minimums in the northern taiga are typically lower than those of the tundra. There are taiga areas of eastern Siberia and interior Alaska-Yukon where the mean annual temperature reaches down to , and the lowest reliably recorded temperatures in the Northern Hemisphere were recorded in the taiga of northeastern Russia.\nTaiga has a subarctic climate with very large temperature range between seasons. would be a typical winter day temperature and an average summer day, but the long, cold winter is the dominant feature. This climate is classified as \"Dfc\", \"Dwc\", \"Dsc\", \"Dfd\" and \"Dwd\" in the K\u00f6ppen climate classification scheme, meaning that the short summers (24\u00a0h average or more), although generally warm and humid, only last 1\u20133 months, while winters, with average temperatures below freezing, last 5\u20137 months.\nIn Siberian taiga the average temperature of the coldest month is between and . There are also some much smaller areas grading towards the oceanic \"Cfc\" climate with milder winters, whilst the extreme south and (in Eurasia) west of the taiga reaches into humid continental climates (\"Dfb\", \"Dwb\") with longer summers.\nAccording to some sources, the boreal forest grades into a temperate mixed forest when mean annual temperature reaches about . Discontinuous permafrost is found in areas with mean annual temperature below freezing, whilst in the \"Dfd\" and \"Dwd\" climate zones continuous permafrost occurs and restricts growth to very shallow-rooted trees like Siberian larch.\nGrowing season.\nThe growing season, when the vegetation in the taiga comes alive, is usually slightly longer than the climatic definition of summer as the plants of the boreal biome have a lower temperature threshold to trigger growth than other plants. Some sources claim 130 days growing season as typical for the taiga.\nIn Canada and Scandinavia, the growing season is often estimated by using the period of the year when the 24-hour average temperature is or more. For the Taiga Plains in Canada, growing season varies from 80 to 150 days, and in the Taiga Shield from 100 to 140 days.\nOther sources define growing season by frost-free days. Data for locations in southwest Yukon gives 80\u2013120 frost-free days. The closed canopy boreal forest in Kenozersky National Park near Plesetsk, Arkhangelsk Province, Russia, on average has 108 frost-free days.\nThe longest growing season is found in the smaller areas with oceanic influences; in coastal areas of Scandinavia and Finland, the growing season of the closed boreal forest can be 145\u2013180 days. The shortest growing season is found at the northern taiga\u2013tundra ecotone, where the northern taiga forest no longer can grow and the tundra dominates the landscape when the growing season is down to 50\u201370 days, and the 24-hr average of the warmest month of the year usually is or less.\nHigh latitudes mean that the sun does not rise far above the horizon, and less solar energy is received than further south. But the high latitude also ensures very long summer days, as the sun stays above the horizon nearly 20 hours each day, or up to 24 hours, with only around 6 hours of daylight, or none, occurring in the dark winters, depending on latitude. The areas of the taiga inside the Arctic Circle have midnight sun in mid-summer and polar night in mid-winter.\nPrecipitation.\nThe taiga experiences relatively low precipitation throughout the year (generally annually, in some areas), primarily as rain during the summer months, but also as snow or fog. Snow may remain on the ground for as long as nine months in the northernmost extensions of the taiga biome.\nThe fog, especially predominant in low-lying areas during and after the thawing of frozen Arctic seas, stops sunshine from getting through to plants even during the long summer days. As evaporation is consequently low for most of the year, annual precipitation exceeds evaporation, and is sufficient to sustain the dense vegetation growth including large trees. This explains the striking difference in biomass per square metre between the Taiga and the Steppe biomes, (in warmer climates), where evapotranspiration exceeds precipitation, restricting vegetation to mostly grasses.\nIn general, taiga grows to the south of the July isotherm, occasionally as far north as the July isotherm, with the southern limit more variable. Depending on rainfall, and taiga may be replaced by forest steppe south of the July isotherm where rainfall is very low, but more typically extends south to the July isotherm, and locally where rainfall is higher, such as in eastern Siberia and adjacent Outer Manchuria, south to the July isotherm.\nIn these warmer areas the taiga has higher species diversity, with more warmth-loving species such as Korean pine, Jezo spruce, and Manchurian fir, and merges gradually into mixed temperate forest or, more locally (on the Pacific Ocean coasts of North America and Asia), into coniferous temperate rainforests where oak and hornbeam appear and join the conifers, birch and Populus tremula.\nGlaciation.\nThe area currently classified as taiga in Europe and North America (except Alaska) was recently glaciated. As the glaciers receded they left depressions in the topography that have since filled with water, creating lakes and bogs (especially muskeg soil) found throughout the taiga.\nSoils.\nTaiga soil tends to be young and poor in nutrients, lacking the deep, organically enriched profile present in temperate deciduous forests. The colder climate hinders development of soil, and the ease with which plants can use its nutrients. The relative lack of deciduous trees, which drop huge volumes of leaves annually, and grazing animals, which contribute significant manure, are also factors. The diversity of soil organisms in the boreal forest is high, comparable to the tropical rainforest.\nFallen leaves and moss can remain on the forest floor for a long time in the cool, moist climate, which limits their organic contribution to the soil. Acids from evergreen needles further leach the soil, creating spodosol, also known as podzol, and the acidic forest floor often has only lichens and some mosses growing on it. In clearings in the forest and in areas with more boreal deciduous trees, there are more herbs and berries growing, and soils are consequently deeper.\nFlora.\nSince North America and Eurasia were originally connected by the Bering land bridge, a number of animal and plant species, more animals than plants, were able to colonize both land masses, and are globally-distributed throughout the taiga biome (see Circumboreal Region). Others differ regionally, typically with each genus having several distinct species, each occupying different regions of the taiga. Taigas also have some small-leaved deciduous trees, like birch, alder, willow, and poplar. These grow mostly in areas further south of the most extreme winter weather.\nThe Dahurian larch tolerates the coldest winters of the Northern Hemisphere, in eastern Siberia. The very southernmost parts of the taiga may have trees such as oak, maple, elm and lime scattered among the conifers, and there is usually a gradual transition into a temperate, mixed forest, such as the eastern forest-boreal transition of eastern Canada. In the interior of the continents, with the driest climates, the boreal forests might grade into temperate grassland.\nThere are two major types of taiga. The southern part is the closed canopy forest, consisting of many closely-spaced trees and mossy groundcover. In clearings in the forest, shrubs and wildflowers are common, such as the fireweed and lupine. The other type is the lichen woodland or sparse taiga, with trees that are farther-spaced and lichen groundcover; the latter is common in the northernmost taiga. In the northernmost taiga, the forest cover is not only more sparse, but often stunted in growth form; moreover, ice-pruned, asymmetric black spruce (in North America) are often seen, with diminished foliage on the windward side.\nIn Canada, Scandinavia and Finland, the boreal forest is usually divided into three subzones: The high boreal (northern boreal/taiga zone), the middle boreal (closed forest), and the southern boreal, a closed-canopy, boreal forest with some scattered temperate, deciduous trees among the conifers. Commonly seen are species such as maple, elm and oak. This southern boreal forest experiences the longest and warmest growing season of the biome. In some regions, including Scandinavia and western Russia, this subzone is commonly used for agricultural purposes.\nThe boreal forest is home to many types of berries. Some species are confined to the southern and middle closed-boreal forest (such as wild strawberry and partridgeberry); others grow in most areas of the taiga (such as cranberry and cloudberry). Some berries can grow in both the taiga and the lower arctic (southern regions) tundra, such as bilberry, bunchberry and lingonberry.\nThe forests of the taiga are largely coniferous, dominated by larch, spruce, fir and pine. The woodland mix varies according to geography and climate; for example, the Eastern Canadian forests ecoregion (of the higher elevations of the Laurentian Mountains and the northern Appalachian Mountains) in Canada is dominated by balsam fir \"Abies balsamea\", while further north, the Eastern Canadian Shield taiga (of northern Quebec and Labrador) is mostly black spruce \"Picea mariana\" and tamarack larch \"Larix laricina\".\nEvergreen species in the taiga (spruce, fir, and pine) have a number of adaptations specifically for survival in harsh taiga winters, although larch, which is extremely cold-tolerant, is deciduous. Taiga trees tend to have shallow roots to take advantage of the thin soils, while many of them seasonally alter their biochemistry to make them more resistant to freezing, called \"hardening\". The narrow conical shape of northern conifers, and their downward-drooping limbs, also help them shed snow.\nBecause the sun is low in the horizon for most of the year, it is difficult for plants to generate energy from photosynthesis. Pine, spruce and fir do not lose their leaves seasonally and are able to photosynthesize with their older leaves in late winter and spring when light is good but temperatures are still too low for new growth to commence. The adaptation of evergreen needles limits the water lost due to transpiration and their dark green color increases their absorption of sunlight. Although precipitation is not a limiting factor, the ground freezes during the winter months and plant roots are unable to absorb water, so desiccation can be a severe problem in late winter for evergreens.\nAlthough the taiga is dominated by coniferous forests, some broadleaf trees also occur, including birch, aspen, willow, and rowan. Many smaller herbaceous plants, such as ferns and occasionally ramps grow closer to the ground. Periodic stand-replacing wildfires (with return times of between 20 and 200 years) clear out the tree canopies, allowing sunlight to invigorate new growth on the forest floor. For some species, wildfires are a necessary part of the life cycle in the taiga; some, e.g. jack pine have cones which only open to release their seed after a fire, dispersing their seeds onto the newly cleared ground; certain species of fungi (such as morels) are also known to do this. Grasses grow wherever they can find a patch of sun; mosses and lichens thrive on the damp ground and on the sides of tree trunks. In comparison with other biomes, however, the taiga has low botanical diversity.\nConiferous trees are the dominant plants of the taiga biome. Very few species, in four main genera, are found: the evergreen spruce, fir and pine, and the deciduous larch. In North America, one or two species of fir, and one or two species of spruce, are dominant. Across Scandinavia and western Russia, the Scots pine is a common component of the taiga, while taiga of the Russian Far East and Mongolia is dominated by larch. Rich in spruce and Scots pine (in the western Siberian plain), the taiga is dominated by larch in Eastern Siberia, before returning to its original floristic richness on the Pacific shores. Two deciduous trees mingle throughout southern Siberia: birch and \"Populus tremula\".\nFauna.\nThe boreal forest/taiga supports a relatively small variety of highly specialized and adapted animals, due to the harshness of the climate. Canada's boreal forest includes 85 species of mammals, 130 species of fish, and an estimated 32,000 species of insects. Insects play a critical role as pollinators, decomposers, and as a part of the food web. Many nesting birds, rodents, and small carnivorous mammals rely on them for food in the summer months.\nThe cold winters and short summers make the taiga a challenging biome for reptiles and amphibians, which depend on environmental conditions to regulate their body temperatures. There are only a few species in the boreal forest, including red-sided garter snake, common European adder, blue-spotted salamander, northern two-lined salamander, Siberian salamander, wood frog, northern leopard frog, boreal chorus frog, American toad, and Canadian toad. Most hibernate underground in winter.\nFish of the taiga must be able to withstand cold water conditions and be able to adapt to life under ice-covered water. Species in the taiga include Alaska blackfish, northern pike, walleye, longnose sucker, white sucker, various species of cisco, lake whitefish, round whitefish, pygmy whitefish, Arctic lamprey, various grayling species, brook trout (including sea-run brook trout in the Hudson Bay area), chum salmon, Siberian taimen, lenok and lake chub.\nThe taiga is mainly home to a number of large herbivorous mammals, such as \"Alces alces\" (moose), and a few subspecies of \"Rangifer tarandus\" (reindeer in Eurasia; caribou in North America). Some areas of the more southern closed boreal forest have populations of other Cervidae species, such as the maral, elk, Sitka black-tailed deer, and roe deer. While normally a polar species, some southern herds of muskoxen reside in the taiga of Russia's Far East and North America. The Amur-Kamchatka region of far eastern Russia also supports the snow sheep, the Russian relative of the American bighorn sheep, wild boar, and long-tailed goral. The largest animal in the taiga is the wood bison of northern Canada/Alaska; additionally, some numbers of the American plains bison have been introduced into the Russian far-east, as part of the taiga regeneration project called \"Pleistocene Park\", in addition to Przewalski's horse.\nSmall mammals of the taiga biome include rodent species such as the beaver, squirrel, chipmunk, marmot, lemming, North American porcupine and vole, as well as a small number of lagomorph species, such as the pika, snowshoe hare and mountain hare. These species have adapted to survive the harsh winters in their native ranges. Some larger mammals, such as bears, eat heartily during the summer in order to gain weight, and then go into hibernation during the winter. Other animals have adapted layers of fur or feathers to insulate them from the cold.\nPredatory mammals of the taiga must be adapted to travel long distances in search of scattered prey, or be able to supplement their diet with vegetation or other forms of food (such as raccoons). Mammalian predators of the taiga include Canada lynx, Eurasian lynx, stoat, Siberian weasel, least weasel, sable, American marten, North American river otter, European otter, American mink, wolverine, Asian badger, fisher, timber wolf, Mongolian wolf, coyote, red fox, Arctic fox, grizzly bear, American black bear, Asiatic black bear, Ussuri brown bear, polar bear (only small areas of northern taiga), Siberian tiger, and Amur leopard.\nMore than 300 species of birds have their nesting grounds in the taiga. Siberian thrush, white-throated sparrow, and black-throated green warbler migrate to this habitat to take advantage of the long summer days and abundance of insects found around the numerous bogs and lakes. Of the 300 species of birds that summer in the taiga, only 30 stay for the winter. These are either carrion-feeding or large raptors that can take live mammal prey, such as the golden eagle, rough-legged buzzard (also known as the rough-legged hawk), Steller's sea eagle (in coastal northeastern Russia-Japan), great gray owl, snowy owl, barred owl, great horned owl, crow and raven. The only other viable adaptation is seed-eating birds, which include several species of grouse, capercaillie and crossbills.\nFire.\nFire has been one of the most important factors shaping the composition and development of boreal forest stands; it is the dominant stand-renewing disturbance through much of the Canadian boreal forest. The fire history that characterizes an ecosystem is its \"fire regime\", which has 3 elements: (1) fire type and intensity (e.g., crown fires, severe surface fires, and light surface fires), (2) size of typical fires of significance, and (3) frequency or return intervals for specific land units. The average time within a fire regime to burn an area equivalent to the total area of an ecosystem is its \"fire rotation\" (Heinselman 1973) or \"fire cycle\" (Van Wagner 1978). However, as Heinselman (1981) noted, each physiographic site tends to have its own return interval, so that some areas are skipped for long periods, while others might burn two-times or more often during a nominal fire rotation.\nThe dominant fire regime in the boreal forest is high-intensity crown fires or severe surface fires of very large size, often more than 10,000 ha (100\u00a0km2), and sometimes more than 400,000 ha (4000\u00a0km2). Such fires kill entire stands. Fire rotations in the drier regions of western Canada and Alaska average 50\u2013100 years, shorter than in the moister climates of eastern Canada, where they may average 200 years or more. Fire cycles also tend to be long near the tree line in the subarctic spruce-lichen woodlands. The longest cycles, possibly 300 years, probably occur in the western boreal in floodplain white spruce.\nAmiro et al. (2001) calculated the mean fire cycle for the period 1980 to 1999 in the Canadian boreal forest (including taiga) at 126 years. Increased fire activity has been predicted for western Canada, but parts of eastern Canada may experience less fire in future because of greater precipitation in a warmer climate.\nThe mature boreal forest pattern in the south shows balsam fir dominant on well-drained sites in eastern Canada changing centrally and westward to a prominence of white spruce, with black spruce and tamarack forming the forests on peats, and with jack pine usually present on dry sites except in the extreme east, where it is absent. The effects of fires are inextricably woven into the patterns of vegetation on the landscape, which in the east favour black spruce, paper birch, and jack pine over balsam fir, and in the west give the advantage to aspen, jack pine, black spruce, and birch over white spruce. Many investigators have reported the ubiquity of charcoal under the forest floor and in the upper soil profile. Charcoal in soils provided Bryson et al. (1965) with clues about the forest history of an area 280\u00a0km north of the then-current tree line at Ennadai Lake, District Keewatin, Northwest Territories.\nTwo lines of evidence support the thesis that fire has always been an integral factor in the boreal forest: (1) direct, eye-witness accounts and forest-fire statistics, and (2) indirect, circumstantial evidence based on the effects of fire, as well as on persisting indicators. The patchwork mosaic of forest stands in the boreal forest, typically with abrupt, irregular boundaries circumscribing homogenous stands, is indirect but compelling testimony to the role of fire in shaping the forest. The fact is that most boreal forest stands are less than 100 years old, and only in the rather few areas that have escaped burning are there stands of white spruce older than 250 years.\nThe prevalence of fire-adaptive morphologic and reproductive characteristics of many boreal plant species is further evidence pointing to a long and intimate association with fire. Seven of the ten most common trees in the boreal forest\u2014jack pine, lodgepole pine, aspen, balsam poplar (\"Populus balsamifera\"), paper birch, tamarack, black spruce \u2013 can be classed as pioneers in their adaptations for rapid invasion of open areas. White spruce shows some pioneering abilities, too, but is less able than black spruce and the pines to disperse seed at all seasons. Only balsam fir and alpine fir seem to be poorly adapted to reproduce after fire, as their cones disintegrate at maturity, leaving no seed in the crowns.\nThe oldest forests in the northwest boreal region, some older than 300 years, are of white spruce occurring as pure stands on moist floodplains. Here, the frequency of fire is much less than on adjacent uplands dominated by pine, black spruce and aspen. In contrast, in the Cordilleran region, fire is most frequent in the valley bottoms, decreasing upward, as shown by a mosaic of young pioneer pine and broadleaf stands below, and older spruce\u2013fir on the slopes above. Without fire, the boreal forest would become more and more homogeneous, with the long-lived white spruce gradually replacing pine, aspen, balsam poplar, and birch, and perhaps even black spruce, except on the peatlands.\nClimate change.\nDuring the last quarter of the twentieth century, the zone of latitude occupied by the boreal forest experienced some of the greatest temperature increases on Earth. Winter temperatures have increased more than summer temperatures. In summer, the daily low temperature has increased more than the daily high temperature. The number of days with extremely cold temperatures (e.g., ) has decreased irregularly but systematically in nearly all the boreal region, allowing better survival for tree-damaging insects. In Fairbanks, Alaska, the length of the frost-free season has increased from 60 to 90 days in the early twentieth century to about 120 days a century later.\nIt has been hypothesized that the boreal environments have only a few states which are stable in the long term - a treeless tundra/steppe, a forest with &gt;75% tree cover and an open woodland with ~20% and ~45% tree cover. Thus, continued climate change would be able to force at least some of the presently existing taiga forests into one of the two woodland states or even into a treeless steppe - but it could also shift tundra areas into woodland or forest states as they warm and become more suitable for tree growth.\nIn keeping with this hypothesis, several studies published in the early 2010s found that there was already a substantial drought-induced tree loss in the western Canadian boreal forests since the 1960s: although this trend was weak or even non-existent in the eastern forests, it was particularly pronounced in the western coniferous forests. However, in 2016, a study found no overall Canadian boreal forest trend between 1950 and 2012: while it also found improved growth in some southern boreal forests and dampened growth in the north (contrary to what the hypothesis would suggest), those patterns were statistically weak.\nA 2018 Landsat reanalysis confirmed that there was a drying trend and a loss of forest in western Canadian forests and some greening in the wetter east, but it had also concluded that most of the forest loss attributed to climate change in the earlier studies had instead constituted a delayed response to anthropogenic disturbance. Subsequent research found that even in the forests where biomass trends did not change, there was a substantial shift towards the deciduous broad-leaved trees with higher drought tolerance over the past 65 years, and another Landsat analysis of 100,000 undisturbed sites found that the areas with low tree cover became greener in response to warming, but tree mortality (browning) became the dominant response as the proportion of existing tree cover increased.\nWhile the majority of studies on boreal forest transitions have been done in Canada, similar trends have been detected in the other countries. Summer warming has been shown to increase water stress and reduce tree growth in dry areas of the southern boreal forest in central Alaska and portions of far eastern Russia. In Siberia, the taiga is converting from predominantly needle-shedding larch trees to evergreen conifers in response to a warming climate. This is likely to further accelerate warming, as the evergreen trees will absorb more of the sun's rays. Given the vast size of the area, such a change has the potential to affect areas well outside of the region. In much of the boreal forest in Alaska, the growth of white spruce trees are stunted by unusually warm summers, while trees on some of the coldest fringes of the forest are experiencing faster growth than previously. Lack of moisture in the warmer summers are also stressing the birch trees of central Alaska.\nIn addition to these observations, there has also been work on projecting future forest trends. A 2018 study of the seven tree species dominant in the Eastern Canadian forests found that while 2\u00a0\u00b0C warming alone increases their growth by around 13% on average, water availability is much more important than temperature and further warming of up to 4\u00a0\u00b0C would result in substantial declines unless matched by increases in precipitation. A 2019 study suggested that the forest plots commonly used to evaluate boreal forest response to climate change tend to have less evolutionary competition between trees than the typical forest, and that with strong competition, there was little net growth in response to warming.\nClimatic change only stimulated growth for trees under weak competition in central boreal forests. A 2021 paper had confirmed that the boreal forests are much more strongly affected by climate change than the other forest types in Canada and projected that most of the eastern Canadian boreal forests would reach a tipping point around 2080 under the RCP 8.5 scenario which represents the largest potential increase in anthropogenic emissions. Another 2021 study projected that under the \"moderate\" SSP2-4.5 scenario, boreal forests would experience a 15% worldwide increase in biomass by the end of the century, but this would be more than offset by the 41% biomass decline in the tropics.\nIn 2022, the results of a 5-year warming experiment in North America had shown that the juveniles of tree species which currently dominate the southern margins of the boreal forests fare the worst in response to even 1.5\u00a0\u00b0C or +3.1\u00a0\u00b0C of warming and the associated reductions in precipitation. While the temperate species which would benefit from such conditions are also present in the southern boreal forests, they are both rare and have slower growth rates.\nA 2022 assessment of tipping points in the climate system designated two inter-related tipping points associated with climate change - the die-off of taiga at its southern edge and the area's consequent reversion to grassland (similar to the Amazon rainforest dieback) and the opposite process to the north, where the rapid warming of the adjacent tundra areas converts them to taiga. While both of these processes can already be observed today, the assessment believes that they would likely not become unstoppable (and thus meet the definition of a tipping point) until global warming of around 4\u00a0\u00b0C. However, the certainty level is still limited and it is possible that 1.5\u00a0\u00b0C would be sufficient for either tipping point; on the other hand, the southern die-off may not be inevitable until 5\u00a0\u00b0C, while the replacement of tundra with taiga may require 7.2\u00a0\u00b0C.\nOnce the \"right\" level of warming is met, either process would take at least 40\u201350 years to finish, and is more likely to unfold over a century or more. While the southern die-off would involve the loss of around 52 billion tons of carbon, the net result is \"cooling\" of around 0.18\u00a0\u00b0C globally and between 0.5\u00a0\u00b0C to 2\u00a0\u00b0C regionally. Likewise, boreal forest expansion into tundra has a net global warming effect of around 0.14\u00a0\u00b0C globally and 0.5\u00a0\u00b0C to 1\u00a0\u00b0C regionally, even though new forest growth captures around 6 billion tons of carbon. In both cases, this is due to the snow-covered ground having a much greater albedo than the forests. According to a later study, disappearing of boreal forests can also increase warming despite the effect on albedo, while the conclusion about cooling from deforestation in these areas made by previous studies results from the failure of models to properly capture the effects of evapotranspiration.\nPrimary boreal forests hold 1,042 billion tonnes of carbon, more than currently found in the atmosphere, 2 times more than all human caused GHG emissions since the year 1870. In a warmer climate their ability to store carbon will be reduced.\nOther threats.\nHuman activities.\nSome of the larger cities situated in this biome are Murmansk, Arkhangelsk, Yakutsk, Anchorage, Yellowknife, Troms\u00f8, Lule\u00e5, and Oulu.\nLarge areas of Siberia's taiga have been harvested for lumber since the collapse of the Soviet Union. Previously, the forest was protected by the restrictions of the Soviet Ministry of Forestry, but with the collapse of the Union, the restrictions regarding trade with Western nations have vanished. Trees are easy to harvest and sell well, so loggers have begun harvesting Russian taiga evergreen trees for sale to nations previously forbidden by Soviet law.\nInsects.\nRecent years have seen outbreaks of insect pests in forest-destroying plagues: the spruce-bark beetle (\"Dendroctonus rufipennis\") in Yukon and Alaska; the mountain pine beetle in British Columbia; the aspen-leaf miner; the larch sawfly; the spruce budworm (\"Choristoneura fumiferana\"); the spruce coneworm.\nPollution.\nThe effect of sulphur dioxide on woody boreal forest species was investigated by Addison et al. (1984), who exposed plants growing on native soils and tailings to 15.2 \u03bcmol/m3 (0.34 ppm) of SO2 on CO2 assimilation rate (NAR). The Canadian maximum acceptable limit for atmospheric SO2 is 0.34 ppm. Fumigation with SO2 significantly reduced NAR in all species and produced visible symptoms of injury in 2\u201320 days. The decrease in NAR of deciduous species (trembling aspen [\"Populus tremuloides\"], willow [\"Salix\"], green alder [\"Alnus viridis\"], and white birch [\"Betula papyrifera\"]) was significantly more rapid than of conifers (white spruce, black spruce [\"Picea mariana\"], and jack pine [\"Pinus banksiana\"]) or an evergreen angiosperm (Labrador tea) growing on a fertilized Brunisol.\nThese metabolic and visible injury responses seemed to be related to the differences in S uptake owing in part to higher gas exchange rates for deciduous species than for conifers. Conifers growing in oil sands tailings responded to SO2 with a significantly more rapid decrease in NAR compared with those growing in the Brunisol, perhaps because of predisposing toxic material in the tailings. However, sulphur uptake and visible symptom development did not differ between conifers growing on the 2 substrates.\nAcidification of precipitation by anthropogenic, acid-forming emissions has been associated with damage to vegetation and reduced forest productivity, but 2-year-old white spruce that were subjected to simulated acid rain (at pH 4.6, 3.6, and 2.6) applied weekly for 7 weeks incurred no statistically significant (P 0.05) reduction in growth during the experiment compared with the background control (pH 5.6) (Abouguendia and Baschak 1987). However, symptoms of injury were observed in all treatments, the number of plants and the number of needles affected increased with increasing rain acidity and with time. Scherbatskoy and Klein (1983) found no significant effect of chlorophyll concentration in white spruce at pH 4.3 and 2.8, but Abouguendia and Baschak (1987) found a significant reduction in white spruce at pH 2.6, while the foliar sulphur content significantly greater at pH 2.6 than any of the other treatments.\nProtection.\nThe taiga stores enormous quantities of carbon, more than the world's temperate and tropical forests combined, much of it in wetlands and peatland. In fact, current estimates place boreal forests as storing twice as much carbon per unit area as tropical forests. Wildfires could use up a significant part of the global carbon budget, so fire management at about 12 dollars per tonne of carbon not released is very cheap compared to the social cost of carbon.\nSome nations are discussing protecting areas of the taiga by prohibiting logging, mining, oil and gas production, and other forms of development. Responding to a letter signed by 1,500 scientists calling on political leaders to protect at least half of the boreal forest, two Canadian provincial governments, Ontario and Quebec, offered election promises to discuss measures in 2008 that might eventually classify at least half of their northern boreal forest as \"protected\". Although both provinces admitted it would take decades to plan, working with Aboriginal and local communities and ultimately mapping out precise boundaries of the areas off-limits to development, the measures were touted to create some of the largest protected areas networks in the world once completed. Since then, however, very little action has been taken.\nFor instance, in February 2010 the Canadian government established limited protection for 13,000 square kilometres of boreal forest by creating a new 10,700-square-kilometre park reserve in the Mealy Mountains area of eastern Canada and a 3,000-square-kilometre waterway provincial park that follows alongside the Eagle River from headwaters to sea.\nNatural disturbance.\nOne of the biggest areas of research and a topic still full of unsolved questions is the recurring disturbance of fire and the role it plays in propagating the lichen woodland. The phenomenon of wildfire by lightning strike is the primary determinant of understory vegetation, and because of this, it is considered to be the predominant force behind community and ecosystem properties in the lichen woodland. The significance of fire is clearly evident when one considers that understory vegetation influences tree seedling germination in the short term and decomposition of biomass and nutrient availability in the long term.\nThe recurrent cycle of large, damaging fire occurs approximately every 70 to 100 years. Understanding the dynamics of this ecosystem is entangled with discovering the successional paths that the vegetation exhibits after a fire. Trees, shrubs, and lichens all recover from fire-induced damage through vegetative reproduction as well as invasion by propagules. Seeds that have fallen and become buried provide little help in re-establishment of a species. The reappearance of lichens is reasoned to occur because of varying conditions and light/nutrient availability in each different microstate. Several different studies have been done that have led to the formation of the theory that post-fire development can be propagated by any of four pathways: self replacement, species-dominance relay, species replacement, or gap-phase self replacement.\nSelf-replacement is simply the re-establishment of the pre-fire dominant species. Species-dominance relay is a sequential attempt of tree species to establish dominance in the canopy. Species replacement is when fires occur in sufficient frequency to interrupt species dominance relay. Gap-Phase Self-Replacement is the least common and so far has only been documented in Western Canada. It is a self replacement of the surviving species into the canopy gaps after a fire kills another species. The particular pathway taken after fire disturbance depends on how the landscape is able to support trees as well as fire frequency. Fire frequency has a large role in shaping the original inception of the lower forest line of the lichen woodland taiga.\nIt has been hypothesized by Serge Payette that the spruce-moss forest ecosystem was changed into the lichen woodland biome due to the initiation of two compounded strong disturbances: large fire and the appearance and attack of the spruce budworm. The spruce budworm is a deadly insect to the spruce populations in the southern regions of the taiga. J.P. Jasinski confirmed this theory five years later stating, \"Their [lichen woodlands] persistence, along with their previous moss forest histories and current occurrence adjacent to closed moss forests, indicate that they are an alternative stable state to the spruce\u2013moss forests\".\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It was too small to undertake sustained operations far away from the home support facilities. Its primary role was found to be in the training schools, preparing new German naval officers for command. It appeared in four sub-types.\nBackground.\nGermany was stripped of its U-boats by the Treaty of Versailles at the end of World War I, but in the late 1920s and early 1930s began to rebuild its armed forces. The pace of rearmament accelerated under Adolf Hitler, and the first Type II U-boat was laid down on 11 February 1935. Knowing that the world would see this step towards rearmament, Hitler reached an agreement with Britain to build a navy up to 35% of the size of the Royal Navy in surface vessels, but equal to the British in number of submarines. This agreement was signed on 18 June 1935, and was commissioned 11 days later.\nDesign.\nThe defining characteristic of the Type II was the small size, its surfaced displacement being between half and one third that of the Type VII, and one third to one fourth of the Type IX's (depending on the variants used for comparison).\nKnown as the \"Einbaum\" (\"dugout canoe\"), it had some advantages over larger boats, chiefly its ability to work in shallow water, dive quickly, and increased stealth due to the low conning tower. However, it had a shallower maximum depth, short range, cramped living conditions, and carried fewer torpedoes.\nThe boat had a single hull, with no watertight compartments. There were three torpedo tubes, all forward, with space for two spare torpedoes inside the pressure hull. Although the boats technically had a deck gun, it was a 20mm weapon best used for defense against aircraft.\nSpace inside was limited. The two spare torpedoes extended from just behind the torpedo tubes to just in front of the control room, and most of the 24-man crew lived in this forward area around the torpedoes, sharing 12 bunks. Four bunks were also provided aft of the engines for the engine room crew. Cooking and sanitary facilities were basic, and in this environment long patrols were very arduous.\nMost Type IIs only saw operational service during the early years of the war, thereafter remaining in training bases. Six were stripped down to their hulls, transported by river and truck to Linz (on the Danube), and reassembled for use in the Black Sea against the Soviet Union.\nIn contrast to other German submarine types, few Type IIs were lost. This reflects their use as training boats, although accidents accounted for several vessels.\nThese boats were a first step towards re-armament, intended to provide Germany with experience in submarine construction and operation and lay the foundation for larger boats to build upon. Only one of these submarines survive; the prototype CV-707, renamed \"Vesikko\" by the Finnish Navy which later bought it.\nOn 3 February 2008, \"The Telegraph\" reported that \"U-20\" had been discovered by Sel\u00e7uk Kolay (a Turkish marine engineer) in of water off the coast of the Turkish city of Zonguldak. According to the report, Kolay knows where \"U-23\" and \"U-19\" are, scuttled in deeper water near \"U-20\".\nType IIA.\nThe Type IIA was a single hull, all welded boat with internal ballast tanks. Compared to the other variants, it had a smaller bridge and could carry the German G7a, G7e torpedoes as well as TM-type torpedo mines. There were separated net cutters in the bow. The net cutters were adopted from the First World War boats but were quickly discontinued during the Second World War.\nDeutsche Werke AG of Kiel built six Type IIAs in 1934 and 1935.\nList of Type IIA submarines.\nThe prototype, built in Finland: Finnish submarine \"Vesikko\"\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-begin/styles.css\"/&gt;\nType IIB.\nThe Type IIB was a lengthened version of the Type IIA. Three additional compartments were inserted amidships which were fitted with additional diesel tanks beneath the control room. The range was increased to 1,800 nautical miles at 12 knots. Diving time was also improved to 30 seconds.\nDeutsche Werke AG of Kiel built four Type IIBs in 1935 and 1936; Germaniawerft of Kiel built fourteen in 1935 and 1936; and Flender Werke AG of L\u00fcbeck built two between 1938 and 1940.

The additional diesel tanks beneath the control room were further enlarged, extending the range to 1,900 nautical miles at 12 knots. Deutsche Werke AG of Kiel built eight Type IICs between 1937 and 1940.\nList of Type IIC submarines.\nThere were eight Type IIC submarines commissioned.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-begin/styles.css\"/&gt;\nType IID.\nThe Type IID had additional saddle tanks fitted to the sides of the external hull. These saddle tanks were used to accommodate additional diesel storage tanks. The diesel oil would float atop the saddle tanks. As oil was consumed, water would gradually fill the tanks to compensate for the positive buoyancy. The range was nearly doubled to at and enabled the Type II to conduct longer operations around the British Isles. A further development was the propellers were fitted with Kort nozzles, intended to improve propulsion efficiency.

{"id": "31306", "revid": "51071301", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31306", "title": "Tritium", "text": "Isotope of hydrogen with two neutrons\nTritium (from grc \" \"\u03c4\u03c1\u03af\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2\" (tr\u00edtos)\"\u00a0'third') or hydrogen-3 (symbol T or 3H) is a rare and radioactive isotope of hydrogen with a half-life of 12.32 years. The tritium nucleus (t, sometimes called a \"triton\") contains one proton and two neutrons, whereas the nucleus of the common isotope hydrogen-1 (\"protium\") contains one proton and no neutrons, and that of non-radioactive hydrogen-2 (\"deuterium\") contains one proton and one neutron. Tritium is the heaviest particle-bound isotope of hydrogen. It is one of the few nuclides with a distinct name. The use of the name hydrogen-3, though more systematic, is much less common.\nNaturally occurring tritium is extremely rare on Earth. The atmosphere has only trace amounts, formed by the interaction of its gases with cosmic rays. It can be produced artificially by irradiation of lithium or lithium-bearing ceramic pebbles in a nuclear reactor and is a low-abundance byproduct in normal operations of nuclear reactors.\nTritium is used as the energy source in radioluminescent lights for watches, night sights for firearms, numerous instruments and tools, and novelty items such as self-illuminating key chains. It is used in a medical and scientific setting as a radioactive tracer. Tritium is also used as a nuclear fusion fuel, along with more abundant deuterium, in tokamak reactors and in hydrogen bombs. Tritium has also been used commercially in betavoltaic devices such as NanoTritium batteries.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nHistory.\nTritium was first detected in 1934 by Ernest Rutherford, Mark Oliphant and Paul Harteck after bombarding deuterium with deuterons (deuterium nuclei). Deuterium is another isotope of hydrogen (of mass 2), which occurs naturally with an abundance of 0.015%. Their experiment could not isolate tritium, which was first accomplished in 1939 by Luis Alvarez and Robert Cornog, who also realized tritium's radioactivity. Willard Libby recognized in 1954 that tritium could be used for radiometric dating of water and wine.\nDecay.\nTritium decays into helium-3 by beta-minus decay as shown in this nuclear equation:\nreleasing 18.6\u00a0keV of energy in the process. The electron's kinetic energy varies, with an average of 5.7\u00a0keV, while the remaining energy is carried off by the nearly undetectable electron antineutrino. Beta particles from tritium can penetrate only about of air, and they are incapable of passing through the dead outermost layer of human skin. Because of their low energy compared to other beta particles, the amount of bremsstrahlung generated is also lower. The unusually low energy released in the tritium beta decay makes the decay (along with that of rhenium-187) useful for attempts at absolute neutrino mass measurement, none of which has yet succeeded.\nThe low energy of tritium's radiation makes it difficult to detect tritium-labeled compounds except by using liquid scintillation counting.\nProduction.\nLithium.\nTritium is most often produced in nuclear reactors by neutron activation of lithium-6. The release and diffusion of tritium and helium produced by the fission of lithium can take place within ceramics known as breeder ceramics. Production of tritium from lithium-6 in such breeder ceramics is possible with neutrons of any energy, though the cross section is higher when the incident neutrons have lower energy, reaching more than 900 barns for thermal neutrons. This is an exothermic reaction, yielding 4.8\u00a0MeV. In comparison, fusion of deuterium with tritium releases about 17.6\u00a0MeV. For applications in proposed fusion energy reactors, such as ITER, pebbles consisting of lithium bearing ceramics including Li2TiO3 and Li4SiO4, are being developed for tritium breeding within a helium-cooled pebble bed, also known as a breeder blanket.\n [&lt;noinclude /&gt;[lithium-6|Li]&lt;noinclude /&gt;] + n \u2192 [&lt;noinclude /&gt;[helium-4|He]&lt;noinclude /&gt;] (2.05\u00a0MeV) + H (2.75\u00a0MeV)\nHigh-energy neutrons can also produce tritium from lithium-7 in an endothermic reaction, consuming 2.466\u00a0MeV. This was discovered when the 1954 Castle Bravo nuclear test produced an unexpectedly high yield. Prior to this test, it was incorrectly assumed that Li would absorb a neutron to become Li, which would beta-decay to [&lt;noinclude /&gt;[beryllium-8|Be]&lt;noinclude /&gt;], which in turn would decay to two He nuclei on a total timeframe much longer than the duration of the explosion.\n [&lt;noinclude /&gt;[lithium-7|Li]&lt;noinclude /&gt;] + n \u2192 [&lt;noinclude /&gt;[helium-4|He]&lt;noinclude /&gt;] + H + n\nThe slowed neutrons from this reaction can still react with Li in the first, exothermic reaction; thus lithium can generate more tritium atoms than neutrons absorbed.\nBoron.\nHigh-energy neutrons irradiating boron-10, also occasionally produce tritium:\n [&lt;noinclude /&gt;[boron-10|B]&lt;noinclude /&gt;] + n \u2192 2 He + H\nA more common result of boron-10 neutron capture is 7Li and a single alpha particle.\nEspecially in pressurized water reactors which only partially thermalize neutrons, the interaction between relatively fast neutrons and the boric acid added as a chemical shim produces small but non-negligible quantities of tritium.\nDeuterium.\nTritium is also produced in heavy water-moderated reactors whenever a deuterium nucleus captures a neutron. This reaction has a small absorption cross section, making heavy water a good neutron moderator, and relatively little tritium is produced. Even so, cleaning tritium from the moderator may be desirable after several years to reduce the risk of its escaping to the environment. Ontario Power Generation's \"Tritium Removal Facility\" is capable of processing up to of heavy water a year, and it separates out about of tritium, making it available for other uses.\nCANDU reactors typically produce of tritium per year, which is recovered at the Darlington Tritium Recovery Facility (DTRF) attached to the 3,512 MWelectric Darlington Nuclear Generating Station in Ontario. The total production at DTRF between 1989 and 2011 was \u2013 with an activity of : an average of about per year.\nDeuterium's absorption cross section for thermal neutrons is about 0.52 millibarn, whereas that of oxygen-16 (16O) is about 0.19 millibarn and that of oxygen-17 (17O) is about 240 millibarns. While 16O is by far the most common isotope of oxygen in both natural oxygen and heavy water; depending on the method of isotope separation, heavy water may be slightly richer in 17O and 18O. Due to both neutron capture and (n,\u03b1) reactions (the latter of which produce 14C, an undesirable long-lived beta emitter, from 17O) they are net \"neutron consumers\" and are thus undesirable in a moderator of a natural uranium reactor which needs to keep neutron absorption outside the fuel as low as feasible. Some facilities that remove tritium also remove (or at least reduce the content of) 17O and 18O, which can \u2013 at least in principle \u2013 be used for isotope labeling.\nIndia, which also has a large fleet of pressurized heavy water reactors (initially CANDU technology but since indigenized and further developed IPHWR technology), also removes at least some of the tritium produced in the moderator/coolant of its reactors but due to the dual use nature of tritium and the Indian nuclear bomb program, less information about this is publicly available than for Canada.\nFission.\nTritium is an uncommon product of the nuclear fission of uranium-235, plutonium-239, and uranium-233, (by ternary fission), with a production of about one atom per 104 fissions, meaning it is in fact produced at \"all\" reactors. The release or recovery of tritium needs to be considered in the operation of nuclear reactors, especially in the reprocessing of nuclear fuel and storage of spent nuclear fuel. The production of tritium is not a goal, but a side-effect. It is discharged to the atmosphere in small quantities by some nuclear power plants. Voloxidation is an optional additional step in nuclear reprocessing that removes volatile fission products (such as all isotopes of hydrogen) before an aqueous process begins. This would in principle enable economic recovery of the produced tritium, but even if the tritium is only disposed of and not used, it has the potential to reduce tritium contamination in the water used, reducing radioactivity released when the water is discharged since tritiated water cannot be removed from \"ordinary\" water except by isotope separation.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Table alignment/tables.css\" /&gt;\nGiven the specific activity of tritium at , one TBq is equivalent to roughly 2.8 mg.\nFukushima Daiichi.\nIn June 2016 the Tritiated Water Task Force released a report on the status of tritium in tritiated water at Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant, as part of considering options for final disposal of the stored contaminated cooling water. This identified that the March 2016 holding of tritium on-site was 760\u00a0TBq (equivalent to 2.1\u00a0g of tritium or 14\u00a0mL of pure tritiated water) in a total of 860,000\u00a0m3 of stored water. This report also identified the reducing concentration of tritium in the water extracted from the buildings etc. for storage, seeing a factor of ten decrease over the five years considered (2011\u20132016), 3.3\u00a0MBq/L to 0.3\u00a0MBq/L (after correction for the 5% annual decay of tritium).\nAccording to a report by an expert panel considering the best approach to dealing with this issue, \"Tritium could be separated theoretically, but there is no practical separation technology on an industrial scale. Accordingly, a controlled environmental release is said to be the best way to treat low-tritium-concentration water.\" After a public information campaign sponsored by the Japanese government, the gradual release into the sea of the tritiated water began on 24 August 2023 and is the first of four releases through March 2024. The entire process will take \"decades\" to complete. China reacted with protest.\nThe IAEA has endorsed the plan. The water released is diluted to reduce the tritium concentration to less than 1500\u00a0Bq/L, far below the limit recommended in drinking water by the WHO.\nHelium-3.\nTritium's decay product helium-3 has a very large cross section (5330 barns) for reacting with thermal neutrons, expelling a proton; hence, it is rapidly converted back to tritium in nuclear reactors.\n [&lt;noinclude /&gt;[helium-3|He]&lt;noinclude /&gt;] + n \u2192 H + H\nThis could allow tritium to be recycled as it decays, maintaining the desired inventory.\nCosmic rays.\nTritium occurs naturally due to cosmic rays interacting with atmospheric gases. In the most important reaction for natural production, a fast neutron (which must have energy greater than 4.0\u00a0MeV) interacts with atmospheric nitrogen:\n [&lt;noinclude /&gt;[nitrogen-14|N]&lt;noinclude /&gt;] + n \u2192 [&lt;noinclude /&gt;[carbon-12|C]&lt;noinclude /&gt;] + H\nWorldwide, the production of tritium from natural sources is about 4 megacuries (148\u00a0PBq) per year. The global equilibrium inventory of tritium created by natural sources remains approximately constant at 70 megacuries (2,590\u00a0PBq), as a balance between the fixed production rate and nuclear decay. These may be taken as 415 g and 7,250 g respectively.\nProduction history.\nUSA.\nTritium for American nuclear weapons was produced in special heavy water reactors at the Savannah River Site until their closures in 1988. With the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START) after the end of the Cold War, the existing supplies were sufficient for the new, smaller number of nuclear weapons for some time.\n of tritium was produced in the United States from 1955 to 1996. Since it continually decays into helium-3, the total amount remaining was about at the time of the report,\nand about as of 2023.\nTritium production was resumed with irradiation of rods containing lithium (replacing the usual control rods containing boron, cadmium, or hafnium), at the reactors of the commercial Watts Bar Nuclear Plant from 2003 to 2005 followed by extraction of tritium from the rods at the Tritium Extraction Facility at the Savannah River Site beginning in November 2006. Tritium leakage from the rods during reactor operations limits the number that can be used in any reactor without exceeding the maximum allowed tritium levels in the coolant.\nProperties.\nTritium has an atomic mass of . Diatomic tritium ( or ) is a gas at standard temperature and pressure. Combined with oxygen, it forms tritiated water ().\nCompared to hydrogen having its natural composition on Earth, tritium has a higher melting point (20.62\u00a0K vs. 13.99\u00a0K), a higher boiling point (25.04\u00a0K vs. 20.27\u00a0K), a higher critical temperature (40.59\u00a0K vs. 32.94\u00a0K) and a higher critical pressure (1.8317\u00a0MPa vs. 1.2858\u00a0MPa).\nTritium's specific activity is .\nTritium figures prominently in studies of nuclear fusion due to its favorable reaction cross section and the large amount of energy (17.6\u00a0MeV) produced through its reaction with deuterium:\n H + H \u2192 He + n\nAll atomic nuclei have a positive charge from their protons, and therefore repel one another because like charges repel (Coulomb's law). However, if the atoms have a high enough temperature and pressure (for example, in the core of the Sun), then their random motions can overcome such repulsion, and they can come close enough for the strong nuclear force to take effect, fusing them into heavier atoms.\nA tritium nucleus (triton), containing one proton and two neutrons, has the same charge as any hydrogen nucleus, and it experiences the same electrostatic repulsion when close to another nucleus. However, the neutrons in the triton increase the attractive strong nuclear force when close enough to another nucleus. As a result, tritium can fuse more easily with other light atoms than ordinary hydrogen can.\nThe same is true, albeit to a lesser extent, of deuterium. This is why brown dwarfs (\"failed\" stars) cannot fuse normal hydrogen, but they do fuse a small minority of deuterium nuclei.\nLike the other isotopes of hydrogen, tritium is difficult to confine. Rubber, plastic, and some kinds of steel are all somewhat permeable. This has raised concerns that if tritium were used in large quantities, in particular for fusion reactors, it might contribute to radioactive contamination, though its short half-life should prevent significant long-term accumulation in the atmosphere.\nThe high levels of atmospheric nuclear weapons testing that took place prior to the enactment of the Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty proved to be unexpectedly useful to oceanographers. The high levels of tritium oxide introduced into upper layers of the oceans have been used in the years since then to measure the rate of mixing of the upper layers of the oceans with their lower levels.\nHealth risks.\nSince tritium is a low energy beta (\u03b2) emitter, it is not dangerous externally (its \u03b2 particles cannot penetrate the skin), but it can be a radiation hazard if inhaled, ingested via food or water, or absorbed through the skin.\nOrganisms can take up HHO, as they would H2O. Plants convert HHO into organically bound tritium (OBT), and are consumed by animals. HHO is retained in humans for around 12 days, with a small portion of it remaining in the body as OBT. Tritium can be passed along the food chain as one organism feeds on another, though the metabolism of OBT is less understood than that of HHO. Tritium can incorporate to RNA and DNA molecules within organisms which can lead to somatic and genetic impacts. These can emerge in later generations.\nHHO has a short biological half-life in the human body of 7 to 14\u00a0days, which both reduces the total effects of single-incident ingestion and precludes long-term bioaccumulation of HHO from the environment. The biological half-life of tritiated water in the human body, which is a measure of body water turn-over, varies with the season. Studies on the biological half-life of occupational radiation workers for free water tritium in a coastal region of Karnataka, India, show that the biological half-life in winter is twice that of the summer. If tritium exposure is suspected or known, drinking uncontaminated water will help replace the tritium from the body. Increasing sweating, urination or breathing can help the body expel water and thereby the tritium contained in it. However, care should be taken that neither dehydration nor a depletion of the body's electrolytes results, as the health consequences of those things (particularly in the short term) can be more severe than those of tritium exposure.\nEnvironmental contamination.\nTritium has leaked from 48 of 65 nuclear sites in the US. In one case, leaking water contained of tritium per liter, which is 375 times the current EPA limit for drinking water, and 28 times the World Health Organization's recommended limit. This is equivalent to or roughly 0.8 parts per trillion.\nThe US Nuclear Regulatory Commission states that in normal operation in 2003, 56 pressurized water reactors released of tritium (maximum: ; minimum: ; average: ) and 24 boiling water reactors released (maximum: ; minimum: 0\u00a0Ci; average: ), in liquid effluents. of tritium weigh about .\nRegulatory limits.\nThe legal limits for tritium in drinking water vary widely from country to country. Some figures are given below:\nThe United States limit results in a dose of 4.0\u00a0millirems (or 40\u00a0microsieverts in SI units) per year per EPA regulation 40CFR141, and is based on outdated dose calculation standards of National Bureau of Standards Handbook 69 circa 1963. Four millirem per year is about 1.3% of the average natural background radiation (~3\u00a0mSv). Updated dose calculation standards based on International Commission on Radiological Protection Report 30 and used in the NRC Regulation 10CFR20 results in a dose of 0.9\u00a0millirem (9\u00a0\u03bcSv) per year at 740\u00a0Bq/L (20\u00a0nCi/L).\nUse.\nRadiometric assays in biology and medicine.\nTritiation of drug candidates allows detailed analysis of their absorption and metabolism. Tritium has also been used for biological radiometric assays, in a process akin to radiocarbon dating. For example, [3H] retinyl acetate was traced through the bodies of rats.\nSelf-powered lighting.\nThe beta particles from small amounts of tritium cause chemicals called \"phosphors\" to glow. This radioluminescence is used in self-powered lighting devices called \"betalights\", which are used for night illumination of https://, watches, exit signs, map lights, navigational compasses (such as current-use M-1950 U.S. military compasses), knives and a variety of other devices. As of 2000[ [update]], commercial demand for tritium is per year and the cost is or more.\nNuclear weapons.\nTritium is an important component in nuclear weapons; it is used to enhance the efficiency and yield of fission bombs and the fission stages of hydrogen bombs in a process known as \"boosting\" as well as in external neutron initiators for such weapons.\nNeutron initiator.\nThese are devices incorporated in nuclear weapons which produce a pulse of neutrons when the bomb is detonated to initiate the fission reaction in the fissionable core (pit) of the bomb, after it is compressed to a critical mass by explosives. Actuated by an ultrafast switch like a krytron, a small particle accelerator drives ions of tritium and deuterium to energies above the 15\u00a0keV or so needed for deuterium-tritium fusion and directs them into a metal target where the tritium and deuterium are adsorbed as hydrides. High-energy fusion neutrons from the resulting fusion radiate in all directions. Some of these strike plutonium or uranium nuclei in the primary's pit, initiating a nuclear chain reaction. The quantity of neutrons produced is large in absolute numbers, allowing the pit to quickly achieve neutron levels that would otherwise need many more generations of chain reaction, though still small compared to the total number of nuclei in the pit.\nBoosting.\nBefore detonation, a few grams of tritium\u2013deuterium gas are injected into the hollow \"pit\" of fissile material. The early stages of the fission chain reaction supply enough heat and compression to start deuterium\u2013tritium fusion; then both fission and fusion proceed in parallel, the fission assisting the fusion by continuing heating and compression, and the fusion assisting the fission with highly energetic (14.1\u00a0MeV) neutrons. As the fission fuel depletes and also explodes outward, it falls below the density needed to stay critical by itself, but the fusion neutrons make the fission process progress faster and continue longer than it would without boosting. Increased yield comes overwhelmingly from the increased fission. The energy from the fusion itself is much smaller because the amount of fusion fuel is much smaller. Effects of boosting include:\nThe tritium in a warhead is continually undergoing radioactive decay, becoming unavailable for fusion. Also, its decay product, helium-3, absorbs neutrons. This can offset or reverse the intended effect of the tritium, which was to generate many free neutrons, if too much helium-3 has accumulated. Therefore, boosted bombs need fresh tritium periodically. The estimated quantity needed is per warhead. To maintain constant levels of tritium, about per warhead per year must be supplied to the bomb.\nOne mole of deuterium-tritium gas contains about of tritium and of deuterium. In comparison, the 20\u00a0moles of plutonium in a nuclear bomb consists of about of plutonium-239.\nTritium in hydrogen bomb secondaries.\nSince tritium undergoes radioactive decay, and is also difficult to confine physically, the much larger secondary charge of heavy hydrogen isotopes needed in a true hydrogen bomb uses solid lithium deuteride as its source of deuterium and tritium, producing the tritium \"in situ\" during secondary ignition.\nDuring the detonation of the primary fission bomb stage in a thermonuclear weapon (Teller\u2013Ulam staging), the sparkplug, a cylinder of 235U/239Pu at the center of the fusion stage(s), begins to fission in a chain reaction, from excess neutrons channeled from the primary. The neutrons released from the fission of the sparkplug split lithium-6 into tritium and helium-4, while lithium-7 is split into helium-4, tritium, and one neutron. As these reactions occur, the fusion stage is compressed by photons from the primary and fission of the 238U or 238U/235U jacket surrounding the fusion stage. Therefore, the fusion stage breeds its own tritium as the device detonates. In the extreme heat and pressure of the explosion, some of the tritium is then forced into fusion with deuterium, and that reaction releases even more neutrons.\nSince this fusion process requires an extremely high temperature for ignition, and it produces fewer and less energetic neutrons (only fission and fusion are net neutron producers), lithium deuteride is not used in boosted bombs, but rather for multi-stage hydrogen bombs.\nControlled nuclear fusion.\nTritium is an important fuel for controlled nuclear fusion in both magnetic confinement and inertial confinement fusion reactor designs. The National Ignition Facility (NIF) uses deuterium\u2013tritium fuel, and the experimental fusion reactor ITER will also do so. The deuterium\u2013tritium reaction is favorable since it has the largest fusion cross section (about 5.0\u00a0barns) and it reaches this maximum cross section at the lowest energy (about 65\u00a0keV center-of-mass) of any potential fusion fuel. As tritium is very rare on earth, concepts for fusion reactors often include the breeding of tritium. During the operation of envisioned breeder fusion reactors, Breeding blankets, often containing lithium as part of ceramic pebbles, are subjected to neutron fluxes to generate tritium to complete the fuel cycle.\nThe Tritium Systems Test Assembly (TSTA) was a facility at the Los Alamos National Laboratory dedicated to the development and demonstration of technologies required for fusion-relevant deuterium\u2013tritium processing.\nElectrical power source.\nTritium can be used in a betavoltaic device to create an atomic battery to generate electricity.\nUse in electron tubes.\nTritium is used in various electron tubes, such as the Zellweger ZE22/3 glow tube. These devices contain a small amount of tritium to ionize the fill gas, typically a noble gas like neon or argon. This ionization ensures reliable and consistent operation by providing a steady current when a high voltage is applied, enhancing the device's performance and stability. The tritium is sealed within a glass envelope with two electrodes, one of which is coated with the radioactive material to create an ion path between the electrodes.\nUse as an oceanic transient tracer.\nAside from chlorofluorocarbons, tritium can act as a transient tracer and can \"outline\" the biological, chemical, and physical paths throughout the world's oceans because of its evolving distribution. Tritium has thus been used as a https:// and ventilation and, for such purposes, is usually measured in tritium units, where 1\u00a0TU is defined as 1 tritium atom per 1018 hydrogen atoms, equal to about 0.118 Bq/liter. As noted earlier, nuclear tests, mainly in the Northern Hemisphere at high latitudes, throughout the late 1950s and early 1960s introduced lots of tritium into the atmosphere, especially the stratosphere. Before these nuclear tests, there were only about 3-4 kg of tritium on the Earth's surface; but these amounts rose by 2-3 orders of magnitude during the post-test period. Some sources reported natural background levels were exceeded by about 1,000\u00a0TU in 1963 and 1964 and the isotope is used in the northern hemisphere to estimate the age of groundwater and construct hydrogeologic simulation models. Estimated atmospheric levels at the height of weapons testing to approach 1,000\u00a0TU and pre-fallout levels of rainwater to be between 5 and 10\u00a0TU. In 1963 Valentia Island Ireland recorded 2,000\u00a0TU in precipitation.\nNorth Atlantic Ocean.\nWhile in the stratosphere (post-test period), the tritium interacted with and oxidized to water molecules and was present in much of the rapidly produced rainfall, making tritium a prognostic tool for studying the evolution and structure of the water cycle as well as the ventilation and formation of water masses in the North Atlantic.\nBomb-tritium data were used from the Transient Tracers in the Ocean (TTO) program in order to quantify the replenishment and overturning rates for deep water located in the North Atlantic.\nBomb-tritium also enters the deep ocean around the Antarctic. Most of the bomb tritiated water (H3HO) throughout the atmosphere can enter the ocean through the following processes:\nThese processes make H3HO a good tracer for time scales of up to a few decades.\nUsing the data from these processes for 1981, the 1-TU isosurface lies between 500 and 1,000\u00a0meters deep in the subtropical regions and then extends to 1,500\u20132,000\u00a0meters south of the Gulf Stream due to recirculation and ventilation in the upper portion of the Atlantic Ocean. To the north, the isosurface deepens and reaches the floor of the abyssal plain which is directly related to the ventilation of the ocean floor over 10\u201320\u00a0year time-scales.\nAlso evident in the Atlantic Ocean is the tritium profile near Bermuda between the late 1960s and late 1980s. There is a downward propagation of the tritium maximum from the surface (1960s) to 400\u00a0meters (1980s), which corresponds to a deepening rate of about 18\u00a0meters per year. There are also tritium increases at 1,500\u00a0m depth in the late 1970s and 2,500\u00a0m in the middle of the 1980s, both of which correspond to cooling events in the deep water and associated deep water ventilation.\nFrom a study in 1991, the tritium profile was used as a tool for studying the mixing and spreading of newly formed North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW), corresponding to tritium increases to 4\u00a0TU. This NADW tends to spill over sills that divide the Norwegian Sea from the North Atlantic Ocean and then flows to the west and equatorward in deep boundary currents. This process was explained via the large-scale tritium distribution in the deep North Atlantic between 1981 and 1983. The sub-polar gyre tends to be freshened (ventilated) by the NADW and is directly related to the high tritium values (&gt;1.5\u00a0TU). Also evident was the decrease in tritium in the deep western boundary current by a factor of 10 from the Labrador Sea to the Tropics, which is indicative of loss to ocean interior due to turbulent mixing and recirculation.\nPacific and Indian oceans.\nIn a 1998 study, tritium concentrations in surface seawater and atmospheric water vapor (10\u00a0meters above the surface) were sampled at the following locations: the Sulu Sea, Fremantle Bay, the Bay of Bengal, Penang Bay, and the Strait of Malacca. Results indicated that the tritium concentration in surface seawater was highest at the Fremantle Bay (about 0.40\u00a0Bq/liter), which could be accredited to the mixing of runoff of freshwater from nearby lands due to large amounts found in coastal waters. Typically, lower concentrations were found between 35 and 45\u00b0 south, and near the equator. Results also indicated that (in general) tritium has decreased over the years (up to 1997) due to the physical decay of bomb tritium in the Indian Ocean. As for water vapor, the tritium concentration was about one order of magnitude greater than surface seawater concentrations (ranging from 0.46 to 1.15\u00a0Bq/L). Therefore, the water vapor tritium is not affected by the surface seawater concentration; thus, the high tritium concentrations in the vapor were concluded to be a direct consequence of the downward movement of natural tritium from the stratosphere to the troposphere (therefore, the ocean air showed a dependence on latitudinal change).\nIn the North Pacific Ocean, the tritium (introduced as bomb tritium in the Northern Hemisphere) spread in three dimensions. There were subsurface maxima in the middle and low latitude regions, which is indicative of lateral mixing (advection) and diffusion processes along lines of constant potential density (isopycnals) in the upper ocean. Some of these maxima even correlate well with salinity extrema. In order to obtain the structure for ocean circulation, the tritium concentrations were mapped on 3 surfaces of constant potential density (23.90, 26.02, and 26.81). Results indicated that the tritium was well-mixed (at 6 to 7\u00a0TU) on the 26.81 isopycnal in the subarctic cyclonic gyre and there appeared to be a slow exchange of tritium (relative to shallower isopycnals) between this gyre and the anticyclonic gyre to the south; also, the tritium on the 23.90 and 26.02 surfaces appeared to be exchanged at a slower rate between the central gyre of the North Pacific and the equatorial regions.\nThe depth penetration of bomb tritium can be separated into three distinct layers:\nMississippi River system.\nTrace amounts of radioactive materials from atomic weapons testing settled throughout the Mississippi River System. Tritium concentrations have been used to understand the residence times of continental hydrologic systems such as lakes, streams, and rivers. \nIn a 2004 study, several rivers were taken into account during the examination of tritium concentrations (starting in the 1960s) throughout the Mississippi River Basin: Ohio River (largest input to the Mississippi River flow), Missouri River, and Arkansas River. The highest tritium concentrations were found in 1963 across locations throughout these rivers. The peak correlates with implementation of the US &amp; Soviet atmospheric test ban treaty in 1962. The overall highest concentrations occurred in the Missouri River (1963) and were greater than 1,200\u00a0TU while the lowest concentrations were found in the Arkansas River (never greater than 850\u00a0TU and less than 10\u00a0TU in the mid-1980s).\nAs for the mass flux of tritium through the main stem of the Mississippi River into the Gulf of Mexico, data indicated that approximately 780\u00a0grams of tritium has flowed out of the River and into the Gulf between 1961 and 1997, an average of 21.7\u00a0grams/yr and 7.7\u00a0PBq/yr. Current fluxes through the Mississippi River are 1 to 2 grams per year as opposed to the pre-bomb period fluxes of roughly 0.4\u00a0grams per year.\nFootnotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

At a distance of just under from the Solar System, it is a relatively nearby star and the closest solitary G-class star. The star appears stable, with little stellar variation, and is metal-deficient (low in elements other than hydrogen and helium) relative to the Sun.\nIt can be seen with the unaided eye with an apparent magnitude of 3.5. As seen from Tau Ceti, the Sun would be in the northern hemisphere constellation Bo\u00f6tes with an apparent magnitude of about 2.6.\nObservations have detected more than ten times as much dust surrounding Tau Ceti as is present in the Solar System. Tau Ceti has been an object of interest for exoplanet searches, and a number of candidate planets have been proposed, but as of 2025[ [update]] there remains no unambiguous evidence of planets. Because of its debris disk, any planet orbiting Tau Ceti would face far more impact events than present day Earth. Despite this hurdle to habitability, its solar analog (Sun-like) characteristics have led to widespread interest in the star. Given its stability, similarity and relative proximity to the Sun, Tau Ceti is consistently listed as a target for the search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI).\nName.\nThe name \"Tau Ceti\" is the Bayer designation for this star, established in 1603 as part of German celestial cartographer Johann Bayer's \"Uranometria\" star catalogue: it is \"number T\" in Bayer's sequence of constellation Cetus. In the catalogue of stars in the \"Calendarium\" of Al Achsasi al Mouakket, written at Cairo about 1650, this star was designated \"Th\u0101lith al Na\u02bd\u0101m\u0101t\" (\u062b\u0627\u0644\u062b \u0627\u0644\u0646\u0639\u0627\u0645\u0627\u062a \u2013 \"th\u0101lith al-na\u02bd\u0101m\u0101t\"), which was translated into Latin as \"Tertia Struthionum\", meaning \"the third of the ostriches\". This star, along with \u03b7 Cet (Deneb Algenubi), \u03b8 Cet (Thanih Al Naamat), \u03b6 Cet (Baten Kaitos), and \u03c5 Cet, were \"Al Na\u02bd\u0101m\u0101t\" (\u0627\u0644\u0646\u0639\u0627\u0645\u0627\u062a), the Hen Ostriches.\nIn Chinese astronomy, the \"Square Celestial Granary\" () refers to an asterism consisting of \u03c4 Ceti, \u03b9 Ceti, \u03b7 Ceti, \u03b6 Ceti, \u03b8 Ceti and 57 Ceti. Consequently, the Chinese name for \u03c4 Ceti itself is \"the Fifth Star of Square Celestial Granary\" ().\nMotion.\nThe proper motion of a star is its rate of movement across the celestial sphere, determined by comparing its position relative to more distant background objects. Moving at arcseconds per year ( years per degree), Tau Ceti is considered to be a high-proper-motion star. A high proper motion is an indicator of closeness to the Sun: nearby stars can traverse an angle of arc across the sky more rapidly than the distant background stars and are thus good candidates for parallax studies. In the case of Tau Ceti, the parallax measurements indicate a distance of . This makes it one of the closest star systems to the Sun and the next-closest spectral class-G star after Alpha Centauri A.\nThe radial velocity of a star is the component of its motion that is toward or away from the Sun. It can be determined by measuring the star's spectrum: due to the Doppler shift, the absorption lines in the spectrum of a star will be shifted slightly toward the red (or longer wavelengths) if the star is moving away from the observer, or toward blue (or shorter wavelengths) when it moves toward the observer. In the case of Tau Ceti, the radial velocity is about \u221217\u00a0km/s, with the negative value indicating that it is moving toward the Sun. The star will make its closest approach to the Sun in about 43,000\u00a0years, when it comes to within .\nThe distance to Tau Ceti, along with its proper motion and radial velocity, together give the motion of the star through space. The space velocity relative to the Sun is . This result can then be used to compute an orbital path of Tau Ceti through the Milky Way. It has a mean galacto-centric distance of () and an orbital eccentricity of 0.22.\nPhysical properties.\nThe Tau Ceti system is believed to have only one stellar component. A dim optical companion has been observed with magnitude 13.1. As of 2000, it was distant from the primary. It may be gravitationally bound, but it is considered more likely to be a line-of-sight coincidence.\nMost of what is known about the physical properties of Tau Ceti and its system has been determined through spectroscopic measurements. By comparing the spectrum to computed models of stellar evolution, the age, mass, radius and luminosity of Tau Ceti can be estimated. However, using an astronomical interferometer, measurements of the radius of the star can be made directly to an accuracy of 0.5%. Through such means, the radius of Tau Ceti has been measured to be of the solar radius. This is about the size that is expected for a star with somewhat lower mass than the Sun.\nRotation.\nThe rotation period for Tau Ceti was measured by periodic variations in the classic H and K absorption lines of singly ionized calcium (Ca II). These lines are closely associated with surface magnetic activity, so the period of variation measures the time required for the activity sites to complete a full rotation about the star. By this means the rotation period for Tau Ceti is estimated to be . Due to the Doppler effect, the rotation rate of a star affects the width of the absorption lines in the spectrum (light from the side of the star moving away from the observer will be shifted to a longer wavelength; light from the side moving towards the observer will be shifted toward a shorter wavelength). By analyzing the width of these lines, the rotational velocity of a star can be estimated. The projected rotation velocity for Tau Ceti is\n\"v\"eq \u00b7 sin \"i\" \u2248 1 km/s,\nwhere \"v\"eq is the velocity at the equator, and \"i\" is the inclination angle of the rotation axis to the line of sight. For a typical G8 star, the rotation velocity is about . The relatively low rotational velocity measurements may indicate that Tau Ceti is being viewed from nearly the direction of its pole.\nMore recently, a 2023 study has estimated a rotation period of and a \"v\"eq sin \"i\" of , corresponding to a pole-on inclination of .\nMetallicity.\nThe chemical composition of a star provides important clues to its evolutionary history, including the age at which it formed. The interstellar medium of dust and gas from which stars form is primarily composed of hydrogen and helium with trace amounts of heavier elements. As nearby stars continually evolve and die, they seed the interstellar medium with an increasing portion of heavier elements. Thus younger stars tend to have a higher portion of heavy elements in their atmospheres than do the older stars. These heavy elements are termed \"metals\" by astronomers, and the portion of heavy elements is the metallicity. The amount of metallicity in a star is given in terms of the ratio of iron (Fe), an easily observed heavy element, to hydrogen. A logarithm of the relative iron abundance is compared to the Sun. In the case of Tau Ceti, the atmospheric metallicity is\nformula_1\u00a0dex,\nequivalent to about a third the solar abundance. Past measurements have varied from \u22120.13 to \u22120.60.\nThis lower abundance of iron indicates that Tau Ceti is almost certainly older than the Sun. Its age had previously been estimated to be , but is now thought to be around . This compares with for the Sun. However, age estimates for Tau Ceti can range from 4.4 to , depending on the model adopted.\nBesides rotation, another factor that can widen the absorption features in the spectrum of a star is pressure broadening. The presence of nearby particles affects the radiation emitted by an individual particle. So the line width is dependent on the surface pressure of the star, which in turn is determined by the temperature and surface gravity. This technique was used to determine the surface gravity of Tau Ceti. The log \"g\", or logarithm of the star's surface gravity, is about 4.4, very close to the log \"g\" \n 4.44 for the Sun.\nLuminosity and variability.\nThe luminosity of Tau Ceti is equal to only 55% of the Sun's luminosity. A terrestrial planet would need to orbit this star at a distance of about to match the solar insolation level of Earth. This is approximately the same as the average distance between Venus and the Sun.\nThe chromosphere of Tau Ceti\u2014the portion of a star's atmosphere just above the light-emitting photosphere\u2014currently displays little or no magnetic activity, indicating a stable star. One 9-year study of temperature, granulation, and the chromosphere showed no systematic variations; Ca II emissions around the H and K infrared bands show a possible 11-year cycle, but this is weak relative to the Sun. Alternatively it has been suggested that the star could be in a low-activity state analogous to a Maunder Minimum\u2014a historical period, associated with the Little Ice Age in Europe, when sunspots became exceedingly rare on the Sun's surface. Spectral line profiles of Tau Ceti are extremely narrow, indicating low turbulence and observed rotation. The star's asteroseismological oscillations have an amplitude about half that of the Sun and a lower mode lifetime.\nSearch for planets.\nPrincipal factors driving research interest in Tau Ceti are its proximity, its Sun-like characteristics, and the implications for possible life on its planets. For categorization purposes, Hall and Lockwood report that \"the terms 'solarlike star', 'solar analog', and 'solar twin' [are] progressively restrictive descriptions\". Tau Ceti fits the second category, given its similar mass and low variability, but relative lack of metals. The similarities have inspired popular culture references for decades, as well as scientific examination. In 1988, radial-velocity observations ruled out any periodical variations attributable to massive planets around Tau Ceti inside of Jupiter-like distances. Ever more precise measurements continue to rule out such planets, at least until December 2012. The velocity precision reached is about 11\u00a0m/s measured over a 5-year time span. This result excludes hot Jupiters and probably excludes any planets with minimal mass greater than or equal to Jupiter's mass and with orbital periods less than 15 years. In addition, a survey of nearby stars by the Hubble Space Telescope's Wide Field and Planetary Camera was completed in 1999, including a search for faint companions to Tau Ceti; none were discovered to limits of the telescope's resolving power.\nHowever, these searches only excluded larger brown dwarf bodies and closer orbiting giant planets, so smaller, Earth-like planets in orbit around the star were not precluded. If hot Jupiters were to exist in close orbit, they would likely disrupt the star's habitable zone; their exclusion was thus considered positive for the possibility of Earth-like planets. General research has shown a positive correlation between the presence of planets and a relatively high-metallicity parent star, suggesting that stars with lower metallicity such as Tau Ceti have a lower chance of having planets.\n! align=center| Companion\n! align=center| Mass\n! align=center| Semimajor axis\n! align=center| Orbital period\n! align=center| Eccentricity\n! align=center| Inclination\n! align=center| Radius\nPlanet candidates.\nOn December 19, 2012, evidence was presented that suggested a system of five candidate planets orbiting Tau Ceti. The planets' estimated minimum masses were between 2 and 6\u00a0Earth masses, with orbital periods ranging from 14 to 640 days. One of them, Tau Ceti e, appeared to orbit about half as far from Tau Ceti as Earth does from the Sun. With Tau Ceti's luminosity of 52% that of the Sun and a distance from the star of 0.552 AU, the planet would receive 1.71 times as much stellar radiation as Earth does, slightly less than Venus with 1.91 times Earth's. Nevertheless, some research placed it within the star's habitable zone. The Planetary Habitability Laboratory estimated that Tau Ceti f, which receives 28.5% as much starlight as Earth, would be within the star's habitable zone, albeit narrowly.\nNew results were published in August 2017. They confirmed Tau Ceti e and f as candidates but failed to consistently detect planets b (which may be a false negative), c (whose weakly defined apparent signal was correlated to stellar rotation), and d (which did not show up in all data sets). Instead, they found two new planetary candidates, g and h, with orbits of 20 and 49 days. The signals detected from the candidate planets have radial velocities as low as 30\u00a0cm/s, and the experimental method used in their detection, as it was applied to HARPS, could in theory have detected down to around 20\u00a0cm/s. The updated 4-planet model is dynamically packed and potentially stable for billions of years.\nIn 2019, a paper published in \"Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics\" suggested that Tau Ceti could have a Jupiter or super-Jupiter based on a tangential astrometric velocity of around 11.3\u00a0m/s. The exact size and position of this conjectured object have not been determined, though it is at most 5 Jupiter masses if it orbits between 3 and 20 AU. A 2020 \"Astronomical Journal\" study by astronomers Jamie Dietrich and Daniel Apai analyzed the orbital stability of the known planets, assuming the 2017 4-planet model, and, considering statistical patterns identified from hundreds of other planetary systems, explored the orbits in which the presence of additional, yet-undetected planets are most likely. This analysis predicted three additional planets at orbits coinciding with planet candidates b, c, and d. The close match between the independently predicted planet periods and the periods of the three planet candidates previously identified in radial velocity data could support the genuine planetary nature of these candidates, although they were rejected by the 2017 paper. Furthermore, the study also predicted at least one yet-undetected planet between planets e and f, i.e., within the habitable zone. This predicted exoplanet was identified as PxP-4.\nAll proposed planet candidates remain unconfirmed; studies of Tau Ceti's radial velocity in 2019, 2021 and 2025 were unable to confirm any planets. In particular, a 2025 study using ESPRESSO data did not detect any planets, while being sensitive to 1.7\u00a0M\ud83d\udf28 planets with periods up to 100 days, and 2\u20135\u00a0M\ud83d\udf28 planets in the habitable zone. These results do not support the existence of Tau Ceti e, while planets g &amp; h are close to the detection limit and planet f is below it. While weak evidence was found for a 20-day signal (corresponding to Tau Ceti g), it is not statistically significant and its planetary nature is considered doubtful.\nSince Tau Ceti is likely aligned in such a way that it is nearly pole-on to Earth (as indicated by its rotation), if its planets share this alignment and have nearly face-on orbits, they would be less similar to Earth's mass and more to Neptune, Saturn, or Jupiter. For example, were Tau Ceti f's orbit inclined 70 degrees from being face-on to Earth, its mass would be Earth masses, making it a middle-to-low end super-Earth. However, these scenarios are not necessarily true; since Tau Ceti's debris disk has an inclination of , the planets' orbits could be similarly inclined. If the debris disk and f's orbits were assumed to be equal, f would be between and Earth masses, making it slightly more likely to be a mini-Neptune. On top of that, the lower the inclination of the planetary orbits the less stable they tend to be over a given time period, as the planets would have greater masses and therefore more gravitational pull which would in turn disturb the orbital stability of neighbouring planets. So, for example, if as estimated in Korolik et al 2023 Tau Ceti has a pole-on inclination of around 7 degrees, and the postulated planets do as well, then those planets' orbits would be verging on instability within just a 10 million year timeframe, and therefore it is extremely unlikely they would have survived for the billions of years that make up the lifetime of the star system.\nTau Ceti e.\nTau Ceti e is a candidate planet orbiting Tau Ceti that was first proposed in 2012 by statistical analyses of the data of the star's variations in radial velocity that were obtained using HIRES, AAPS, and HARPS. Its possible properties were refined in 2017: if confirmed, it would orbit at a distance of 0.552\u00a0AU (between the orbits of Venus and Mercury in the Solar System) with an orbital period of 168 days and has a minimum mass of 3.93 Earth masses. If Tau Ceti e possessed an Earth-like atmosphere, the surface temperature would be around . Based upon the incident flux upon the planet, a study by G\u00fcdel et al. (2014) speculated that the planet may lie outside the habitable zone and closer to a Venus-like world. As of 2025[ [update]], the existence of this planet is doubtful as attempts to detect it with the ESPRESSO spectrograph have failed, despite being sensitive to it.\nTau Ceti f.\nTau Ceti f is a candidate planet orbiting Tau Ceti that was proposed in 2012 by statistical analyses of the star's variations in radial velocity, and also recovered by further analysis in 2017. It is of interest because its orbit places it in Tau Ceti's extended habitable zone. However, a 2015 study implies that it would have been in the temperate zone for less than one billion years, so there may not be a detectable biosignature.\nFew properties of the planet are known other than its orbit and mass. It orbits Tau Ceti at a distance of 1.35\u00a0AU (near Mars's orbit in the Solar System) with an orbital period of 642 days and has a minimum mass of 3.93 Earth masses.\nHowever, a reanalysis of the data in 2021 provided an in-depth study of the HARPS spectrograph systematics, showing that the 600-day signal was likely a spurious combination of instrumental systematics with a potential 1000-day yet unknown signal.\nDebris disk.\nIn 2004, a team of UK astronomers led by Jane Greaves discovered that Tau Ceti has more than ten times the amount of cometary and asteroidal material orbiting it than does the Sun. This was determined by measuring the disk of cold dust orbiting the star produced by collisions between such small bodies. This result puts a damper on the possibility of complex life in the system, because any planets would suffer from large impact events roughly ten times more frequently than present day Earth. Greaves noted at the time of her research that \"it is likely that [any planets] will experience constant bombardment from asteroids of the kind believed to have wiped out the dinosaurs\". Such bombardments would inhibit the development of biodiversity between impacts. However, it is possible that a large Jupiter-sized gas giant could deflect comets and asteroids.\nThe debris disk was discovered by measuring the amount of radiation emitted by the system in the far infrared portion of the spectrum. The disk forms a symmetric feature that is centered on the star, and its outer radius averages . The lack of infrared radiation from the warmer parts of the disk near Tau Ceti implies an inner cut-off at a radius of . By comparison, the Solar System's Kuiper belt extends from 30 to . To be maintained over a long period of time, this ring of dust must be constantly replenished through collisions by larger bodies. The bulk of the disk appears to be orbiting Tau Ceti at a distance of 35\u2013, well outside the orbit of the habitable zone. At this distance, the dust belt may be analogous to the Kuiper belt that lies outside the orbit of Neptune in the Solar System.\nTau Ceti shows that stars need not lose large disks as they age, and such a thick belt may not be uncommon among Sun-like stars. Tau Ceti's belt is only 1/20 as dense as the belt around its young neighbor, Epsilon Eridani. The relative lack of debris around the Sun may be the unusual case: one research-team member suggests the Sun may have passed close to another star early in its history and had most of its comets and asteroids stripped away. Stars with large debris disks have changed the way astronomers think about planet formation because debris disk stars, where dust is continually generated by collisions, appear to form planets readily.\nHabitability.\nTau Ceti's habitable zone\u2014the locations where liquid water could be present on an Earth-sized planet\u2014spans a radius of 0.55\u20131.16\u00a0AU, where 1\u00a0AU is the average distance from the Earth to the Sun. Primitive life on Tau Ceti's planet candidates may reveal itself through an analysis of atmospheric composition via spectroscopy, if the composition is unlikely to be abiotic, just as oxygen on Earth is indicative of life.\nThe most optimistic search project to date was Project Ozma, which was intended to \"search for extraterrestrial intelligence\" (SETI) by examining selected stars for indications of artificial radio signals. It was run by the astronomer Frank Drake, who selected Tau Ceti and Epsilon Eridani as the initial targets. Both are located near the Solar System and are physically similar to the Sun. No artificial signals were found despite 200 hours of observations. Subsequent radio searches of this star system have turned up negative.\nThis lack of results has not dampened interest in observing the Tau Ceti system for biosignatures. In 2002, astronomers Margaret Turnbull and Jill Tarter developed the Catalog of Nearby Habitable Systems (HabCat) under the auspices of Project Phoenix, another SETI endeavour. The list contained more than theoretically habitable systems, approximately 10% of the original sample. The next year, Turnbull would further refine the list to the 30 most promising systems out of within 100 light-years from the Sun, including Tau Ceti; this will form part of the basis of radio searches with the Allen Telescope Array. She chose Tau Ceti for a final shortlist of just five stars suitable for searches by the (now cancelled) Terrestrial Planet Finder telescope system, commenting that \"these are places I'd want to live if God were to put our planet around another star\".\nIn fiction.\nProject Hail Mary, the 2021 novel by Andy Weir, takes places around Tau Ceti. Protagonist Ryland Grace travels to the Tau Ceti solar system aboard the Hail Mary to save humankind from possible extinction after the Sun gets infected by a microorganism called Astrophage. The book won numerous prizes and is currently being adapted to film by Phil Lord and Christopher Miller.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;"}

His name means, \"He who makes sacrifices\" or \"He who does penance.\" Either Tizoc or his successor Ahuitzotl was the first \"tlatoani\" of Tenochtitlan to assume the title \"Huey Tlatoani\" (\"supreme \"tlatoani\"\") to make their superiority over the other cities in the Triple Alliance (Aztec Empire) clear.\nBiography.\nFamily.\nTizoc was a son of the princess Atotoztli II and her cousin, prince Tezozomoc. He was a grandson of Emperors Moctezuma I and Itzcoatl. He was a descendant of the King Cuauhtototzin.\nHe was successor of his brother Axayacatl and was succeeded by his other brother, Ahuitzotl; his sister was the Queen Chalchiuhnenetzin, married to Moquihuix, tlatoani of Tlatel\u014dlco. He was an uncle of Emperors Cuauht\u00e9moc, Moctezuma II and Cuitl\u00e1huac and grandfather of Diego de San Francisco Tehuetzquititzin.\nReign.\nMost sources agree that Tizoc took power in 1481 (the Aztec year \"2 House\"), succeeding his older brother. Although Tizoc's reign was relatively short, he began the rebuilding of the Great Pyramid of Tenochtitlan (a task completed by his younger brother in 1487), and also put down a rebellion of the Matlatzincan peoples of the Toluca Valley.\nAccording to the , during Tizoc's reign the of Tonalimoquetzayan, Toxico, Ecatepec, Cill\u00e1n, Tecaxic, Tolocan, Yancuitlan, Tlappan, Atezcahuacan, Mazatl\u00e1n, Xochiyetla, Tamapachco, Ecatliquapechco and Miquetlan were conquered.\nDeath.\nTizoc died in 1486, though it is still somewhat unclear how.

Berra is academy professor and professor emeritus of evolution, ecology and organismal biology at Ohio State University. He received his MS (1967) and PhD in biology from Tulane University in 1969. He is a three-time recipient of Fulbright Fellowships to Australia in 1969, 1979, and 2009. He taught at the University of Papua New Guinea before joining the faculty of OSU in 1972. He has spent over 11 years doing fieldwork in Australia. He is known for his ichthyological research and biographies of Charles Darwin, Darwin's children and naturalist William Beebe. Berra has researched and written about the Murray cod, trout cod, Australian grayling, salamanderfish, galaxiids, megamouth shark and the nurseryfish. In 2009 the Smithsonian Institution received his collection of 260 species of rare fishes. In 2022 the National Center for Science Education (NCSE) presented Berra the \"Friend of Darwin\" award.\nEarly life and education.\nBorn August 31, 1943, in St. Louis, Missouri, Berra credits his mother helping him with his career in science, by allowing him to read at the dinner table despite his father thinking it wasn't a good idea. He dedicated his book \"Evolution and the Myth of Creationism\" to his mother saying \"For my mother for allowing me to read during meals\". He acquired a love of fish because he kept tropical fish in his bedroom as a child, which led him to read about how to take care of them to keep them healthy. He said his, \"hobby education led to a career down the road\".\nBerra received his BS in biology at Saint Louis University and his MS and PhD in biology at Tulane University in Louisiana. He has received three Fulbright scholarships which allowed him to study abroad in Australia. He is a professorial fellow at Charles Darwin University in Darwin, Australia.\nCareer.\nBerra has been called \"an international expert in freshwater fish, with a reputation for solving long-standing mysteries\". His notable work includes the taxonomic separation of two species of Australian cod (the trout cod from Murray cod) in the Murray River, and solving the disappearance and reappearance of the salamanderfish in Southwestern Australia, discovering that they burrow when the pools dry only to reappear later when the water returns.\nIn 1988, Berra contributed to the preservation of a megamouth shark, a species witnessed rarely before that, described as \"one of the most important zoological finds of the decade\".\nBerra's 1996 research on \"Galaxias maculatus\" proved that its freshwater distribution around the Southern Hemisphere was due to dispersal through the sea of salt-tolerant juveniles. He has also worked on other Chilean galaxiids.\nBerra is a university professorial fellow at Charles Darwin University, a research associate at the Northern Territory Museum, and emeritus professor of evolution, ecology, and organismal biology at Ohio State University.\n \nCharles Darwin.\nFascinated as a child by the adventures of the HMS \"Beagle\" and the naturalist William Beebe, Berra has written several books on Charles Darwin, Darwin's family and in 1977, Beebe. \"Charles Darwin: The Concise Story of an Extraordinary Man\" was published in 2009, timed for the 200th anniversary of Darwin's birth in 1809. Berra became interested in the children of Darwin and his wife Emma Wedgwood. The children had often been mentioned in other books, but little had been written about their lives, Berra researched the ten children and published \"Darwin and His Children: His Other Legacy\" in 2013. Darwin and his wife were first cousins, which interested Berra on how this might have affected the family genetics. Their consanguine marriage possibly affected the children with \"reduced fertility\" compared with similar families of their class during that time. Seven children lived to adulthood, only three of those had children. Darwin himself suffered from ill-health, \"severe digestive problems and a skin disease that made shaving so painful that he grew his distinctive beard\". Berra asked researchers in Spain who had used computer modeling to understand the genetics of the Habsburg family tree to look into the genetics of the Darwin family. The result was that there was an increased risk of low-fertility and bacterial infections, which at least two of Darwin's children died of.\nIn 2016 \"The Washington Post\" contacted Berra to weigh in on the importance of finding a letter from Darwin that had been stolen 30-years prior by an intern at the Smithsonian. Berra explained that while Darwin was trained as a geologist and would have been \"interested in what was going on in America\", this letter would be one of over 7,000 letters written by Darwin and anything by Darwin \"is of historical significance and scientific significance\". Berra has pushed for the city of Darwin to fully embrace the man and legacy that they are named for. In 2014 Berra said that when he started coming to Darwin in 2001 he was \"struck by the fact that there was nothing visible about him [Darwin] to the public.\" Today, the \"Beagle\" ship bell chimes and bust of Darwin reside in Darwin's Civic Center, and the former Northern Territory University is renamed Charles Darwin University. Berra gave the keynote address on Darwin in 2009 at the 200th anniversary of the birth of Darwin held at the Darwin Convention Center in Darwin.\nAfter retirement.\nIn 1995, Berra retired from teaching full time. In 2009 he won his third Fulbright Fellowship, and continued to publish books and scientific papers. In 2016 as a professorial fellow stationed at Charles Darwin University in Darwin, Australia, Berra continued his work on nurseryfish. His research on the nurseryfish was to investigate the male's unique adaptation, carrying thousands of fertilized eggs on a hook \"like a bunch of grapes\". Berra wanted to know how the embryos attached to the hook, and if the male was the genetic father of the embryos. \nDuring one of the research trips in 2011 with Wedd on the Adelaide River they encountered a 5-metre crocodile locals call Agro eating the fish that Berra and Wedd had trapped in a net they were using in their research. Argo got his teeth into the net and before Berra and Wedd could attempt releasing it, Argo tore a \"humungous hole\" in the net. The rest of the day Argo followed them around the river.\nIn 2009 the Smithsonian Institution received Berra's collection of 260 species of rare fishes. Berra and his wife Rita M. Berra endowed the first chair established at Ohio State's regional campus. Berra hopes that the chair will be filled by a scientist that will do field work and return to teach at the Mansfield campus, also Berra made the bequest to honor his wife Rita, of whom he said \"She has made my life easier for all these years and has provided unselfish support, freeing me to pursue my research\". The chair is called the Tim M. and Rita M. Berra Endowed Chair in Evolutionary Biology, in the Department of Evolution, Ecology and Organismal Biology.\nPersonal life.\nBerra decided to apply his professional curiosity towards one of his other passions, bourbon. He attended Bourbon Academy and Moonshine University, read many books and in 2019 authored his own, \"Bourbon: What the Educated Drinker Should Know\". Berra states that his \"scientific training and methods helped him find and organize information\". \nUntil 2022, Berra was spending winters as a resident of Anna Maria Island in Florida. Married to Rita M. Berra.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Derived from the preceding Type IA class, it was designed as a large ocean-going submarine for sustained operations far from the home support facilities. It appeared in various sub-types: the first four subtypes IXA, IXB and IXC and IXC/40 differed only by an ever widened and lengthened outer hull to increase fuel storage and range. The Type IXD had yet again a larger outer hull, but also a lengthened pressure hull to install different engines. The Type IXD came in three versions: the type IXD1 used its larger engine room to install more diesel power for higher top speed. The nearly identical IXD2 and IXD/42 used the extra engine space for economical cruising engines which extended their range to three times the range of the original type IXA design.\nDesign.\nThe Anglo-German Naval Agreement of 1935 allowed Germany to build a U-Boat fleet of . Parts for two Type I, twenty-four Type II and ten Type VII U-boats had already been produced before the conclusion of the agreement and these thirty-six U-boats comprising were built within the year. The German Navy wanted to spend the remaining on a large U-boat, capable of operating in the Mediterranean Sea. In order to speed up construction, the existing Type I design was modified to fulfill the extra requirements. To improve speed, a more powerful diesel engine was installed. To increase torpedo capacity, the upper deck was widened, providing space to store ten spare torpedoes below deck in water-tight containers.\nArmament.\nType IXs had six torpedo tubes; four at the bow and two at the stern. They carried six torpedoes in the tubes, six reloads internally and ten spare torpedoes externally in pressure-tight containers. These boats could also be fitted for mine operations; as mine-layers they could carry 44 TMA or 60 TMB mines.\nType IXs had a standard gun armament consisting of one deck gun mounted before the conning tower, one 3.7 cm SK C/30 mounted after the conning tower and one C/30 mounted on a platform aft of the conning tower. As from 1942, the deck gun was removed from most U-boats as it had little use anymore, except for U-boats operating in the Indian Ocean. At the same time the anti-airraft defense was reinforced by substituting the lone 2 cm gun by two twin 2 cm guns on the higher platform behind the conning tower, whilst the 3.7 cm gun was moved to a lower platform behind the conning tower. In order to compensate for the extra volume caused by the installation of extra anti-aircraft guns, some of the U-boats had a part of their forward deck removed.\nSubclasses.\nType IXA.\nThe first four Type IX U-boats were ordered on 29 July 1936 from DeSchiMAG AG Weser in Bremen, and on 21 November a further four were ordered from the same yard. The eight U-boats were commissioned in 1938-39. Six were lost in action and two were scuttled at the end of the war.\nType IXB.\nOn 17 July 1937 the British amended the Anglo-German Naval Agreement for an expansion of their submarine fleet. As a consequence Germany was also allowed more tonnage for their U-boats and part of this tonnage was used to order two Type IXB on 21 July. The Type IXB was nearly identical to the Type IXA, except for a wider outer hull, which increased fuel storage to , and for the deck gun being mounted closer to the conning tower. \nIn 1938, the Germans invoked a clausule of the Anglo-German Naval- Agreement which allowed them to build submarines in parity with the British. A further eight Type IXB were ordered on 24 May 1938 and a ninth was ordered on 9 August. A total of fourteen Type IXB was ordered from DeSchiMAG AG Weser in Bremen. These U-boats were commissioned in 1939-40. Thirteen were sunk in the course of the war, the remaining one was decommissioned and sabotaged when Lorient Submarine Base was evacuated in 1944.\nType IXC.\nThe Type IXC had again a wider outer hull, with storage for an additional 43 tonnes of fuel, increasing the boat's range. This series omitted the control room periscope leaving the boats with two tower scopes. The 35 boats of through and through were not fitted for mine operations. \nThe first ten Type IXC were ordered on 7 August 1939. Three shipyards, DeSchiMAG AG Weser and Seebeckwerft of Bremen, and Deutsche Werft of Hamburg built 54 Type IXC submarines, which were commissioned in 1941-42. 49 Type IXC U-boats were lost. Two were decommissioned in French ports and could not be evacuated to Germany when the Allies overran France in 1944. One was given to Japan as a gift from Hitler, one surrendered at the end of the war, and \"U-505\" was captured at sea and survives at the Museum of Science and Industry in Chicago.\nType IXC/40.\nType IXC/40 was an improved Type IXC with slightly increased range. The 87 Type IXC/40 U-boats built at DeSchiMAG AG Weser and Seebeckwerft of Bremen, and Deutsche Werft of Hamburg were commissioned in 1942-44. After the decision of Karl D\u00f6nitz on 13 August 1943 to focus on the construction of the new Elektroboote, on 30 September 1943, the outstanding order for 71 Type IXC/40 was cancelled. 64 Type IXC/40 were lost in action, four were decommissioned before the end of the war, two were scuttled, one was transferred to the Japanese Navy and sixteen surrendered. The Type IXC/40 was sunk on 5 May 1945, but raised and is on display at Woodside Ferry Terminal, Birkenhead.\nType IXD1.\nAfter the cancelling of the Type XI U-cruisers at the beginning of the war which were intended for patrols against independently sailing vessels in remote areas, D\u00f6nitz sought a way to replace these U-cruisers with an existing design that could be modified without much impact on existing U-boat production. The solution was to adapt the Type IXC into two designs : a high-speed Type IXD1 and a long-range Type IXD2. On 28 May 1940 the first IXD U-boats were ordered. Only two Type IXD1 U-boats were built, was commissioned on 10 December 1941 and on 8 April 1942.\nThe Type IXD1 was significantly longer and heavier than the IXC/40. It had three pairs of 20-Cylinder, four-stroke Daimler Benz MB501 diesels, which were also used for E-boats, with a total of . This installation was not successful: it produced too much exhaust smoke, and the heat in the engine room was unbearable because of defective cooling. Since they were not fit for war patrols, it was decided in the autumn of 1943 to convert the two Type IXD1 U-boats into transport U-boats. They had their torpedo tubes removed and the six diesel engines were replaced with two Type VIIC Germaniawerft F46 diesel engines. As a consequence top speed dropped to . In their new role they could transport 252 tonnes of cargo.\nType IXD2 and IXD/42.\nApart from the two standard MAN M9V40/46 diesel engine totalling , the Type IXD2 had two extra six-cylinder, four-stroke MWM RS34S diesel generators totalling for economical cruising.The IXD2 had a range of at and . The IXD/42 was almost identical. Most of the Type IXD2 were sent to patrols in the Indian Ocean as part of the Monsun Gruppe and were equipped with a Focke-Achgelis Fa 330 rotor kite which was stored in two watertight vertical canisters behind the conning tower.\nThe first two Type IXD2 U-boats were ordered on 15 August 1940. DeSchiMAG AG Weser of Bremen built 28 Type IXD2 U-boats, which were commissioned in 1942-44. Following the decision by D\u00f6nitz to stop building conventional U-boats, the orders for 22 Type IXD/42 U-boats was cancelled. Only two that were already under construction by DeSchiMAG AG Weser of Bremen, were continued. Only was launched on 28 April 1944 and commissioned 27 March 1945, and surrendered at the end of the war. The other Type IXD/42 was launched on 17 May 1944 but was badly damaged on 30 March 1945 by US bombs while still in the dockyard and never commissioned.\nOperational history.\nOn 1 September 1939 only nine Type IXA and one Type IXB were in service. Due to the lack of available U-boats, most of the Type IX were used for patrols in British waters and only rarely operations were mounted to the more distant waters of West-Africa. Type IX U-boats were first put to good use when the united States entered the war in December 1941. During the Second Happy Time Type IXs mounted very successful operations to the East Coast of the United States and the Caribbean Sea. In October 1942 these U-boats started operations as far south as Cape Horn and ventured into the Indian Ocean. Eventually in 1943 a German base was established in Penang from where Type IXC and type IXD2 U-boats could operate.\" Operating from that base, the Type IXD2 executed a unique patrol around Australia, reaching Tasmania and New Zealand, and was the only U-boat to sink a ship in the Pacific Ocean.\nType IX U-boats sank two escort carriers and two cruisers, but their most efforts were directed against merchant shipping: of the twenty most successful U-boats, fourteen were Type IXs.\" The most successful patrol of the war was executed by Type IXB , sinking fourteen ships for \u00a0GRT.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is described as \"celebrating C's syntactical opaqueness\". The winning code for the 28th contest, held in 2024/25, was announced by live stream 2 Aug 2025 in addition video segments for each of the 23 winners.\nEntries are evaluated anonymously by the current sitting judges, Leonid A. Broukhis &amp; Landon Curt Noll. The judging process is documented in the competition guidelines and consists of elimination rounds. By tradition, no information is given about the total number of entries for each competition. Winning entries are awarded with a category, such as \"Worst Abuse of the C preprocessor\" or \"Most Erratic Behavior\", and then announced on the official IOCCC website. The contest states that being announced on the IOCCC website is the reward for winning (plus bragging rights).\nPrevious contests were held in the years 1984\u20131996, 1998, 2000, 2001, 2004\u20132006, 2011\u20132015, 2018\u20132020, and 2024.\nHistory.\nThe IOCCC was started by Landon Curt Noll and Larry Bassel in 1984 while employed at National Semiconductor's Genix porting group. The idea for the contest came after they compared notes with each other about some poorly written code that they had to fix, notably the Bourne shell, which used macros to emulate ALGOL 68 syntax, and a buggy version of finger for BSD. The contest itself was the topic of a quiz question in the 1993 Computer Bowl. After a hiatus of five years starting in 2006, the contest returned in 2011.\nCompared with other programming contests, the IOCCC is described as \"not all that serious\" by Michael Swaine, editor of \"Dr. Dobb's Journal\".\nIn Don Libes' book says:\n...they will undoubtedly force you to expand your own mind when you study them. And admittedly, some are just downright insane and only good for laughing at and making fun of.\nRules.\nThe Rules vary from year to year and are posted with a set of Guidelines that attempt to convey additional enlightenment about the Rules. They are published on the IOCCC website. In addition all material including winning entries are published under Creative Commons license BY-SA 4.0 International.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nHacking the contest rules is a tradition.\n\u2014Landon Curt Noll, 2011\nThe Rules are often deliberately written with loopholes that contestants are encouraged to find and abuse. Entries that take advantage of loopholes can cause the rules for the following year's contest to be adjusted.\nThe most significant of the Rules is Rule 2a &amp; 2b (originally Rule 1), gross &amp; net source size limits. During the life time of the contest, Rule 2 has evolved to accommodate subtle increases in source size limits. The 1984 contest started with a maximum source size of 512 bytes, which increased a few more times to 1536 bytes in 1991. In 1992, Rule 2 was split to distinguish between maximum overall size and maximum size ignoring white space and semicolons given certain conditions. In the early days, in order to make best use of space allowed, white space was stripped, often resulting in a compact blob of text, making it hard to read by humans, but served little purpose once passed through a C \"pretty print\" utility, which the judges did as part of their process. In 1992 the judges believed that form of obfuscation had played out and they wanted to encourage people to explore other ways of formatting the code, such as an ASCII image themed after the entry, or simply more traditionally indented C source. Around 2012/2013 the iocccsize(1) tool was adopted by the contest and tweaked to aid both contestants and judges apply the Rule 2b counting algorithm.\nObfuscations employed.\nEntries often employ strange or unusual tricks, such as using the C preprocessor to do things it was not designed to do or avoiding commonly used constructs in the C programming language in favor of much more obscure ways of achieving the same thing.\nContributions have included source code formatted to resemble images, text, etc., after the manner of ASCII art, preprocessor redefinitions to make code harder to read, and self-modifying code. In several years an entry was submitted that required a new definition of some of the rules for the next year, regarded as a high honor. An example is the world's shortest self-reproducing program. The entry was a program designed to output its own source code, and which had zero bytes of source code. When the program ran, it printed out zero bytes, equivalent to its source code.\nIn the effort to take obfuscation to its extremes, contestants have produced programs which skirt around the edges of C standards, or result in constructs which trigger rarely used code path combinations in compilers. As a result, several of the past entries may not compile directly in a modern compiler, and some may cause crashes.\nDuring the hiatus between 2020 and 2024 (the Great Fork Merge), many of the winners were updated for modern compilers, for example converting from K&amp;R C to at least C89 syntax, except where doing so would have broken the obfuscation (the original versions are still available for viewing). So with 2024, it should be possible to execute all the entries. The web site documents and invites C programmers to fix those winners still with outstanding issues.\nExamples.\nWithin the code size limit of only a few kilobytes, contestants have managed to do complicated things \u2013 a 2004 winner turned out an operating system.\nToledo Nanochess.\n\"Toledo Nanochess\" is a chess engine created by Mexican software developer Oscar Toledo Guti\u00e9rrez, a five-time winner of the IOCCC. In accordance with IOCCC rules, the original being 1963 characters long. The author claims that it is the world's smallest chess program written in C.\nThe source code for \"Toledo Nanochess\" and other engines is available.

{"id": "31335", "revid": "31966049", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31335", "title": "Territorial integrity", "text": "Principle under international law that prohibits states from using force to annex territory\nTerritorial integrity is the principle under international law where sovereign states have a right to defend their borders and all territory in them from another state. It is enshrined in of the UN Charter and has been recognized as customary international law. Under this principle, forcible imposition of a border change is an act of aggression. \nIn the post-World War years, there has been tension between this principle and the concept of humanitarian intervention under Article 73.b of the United Nations Charter \"to develop self-government, to take due account of the political aspirations of the peoples, and to assist them in the progressive development of their free political institutions, according to the particular circumstances of each territory and its peoples and their varying stages of advancement.\" \nSome of the strongest safeguards of territorial integrity are rule of law such as Charter of the United Nations and nuclear deterrence.\nScholars have debated the existence of a territorial integrity norm since the end of World War II. Conquest of large swaths of territory has been rare, but states have since 1945 continued to pursue (and often successfully) the violent annexation of small swaths of territory.\nHistory.\nPrior to the modern era, there was not a clearly defined system of international boundaries. Rather, authority over territorial spaces was non-linear, often overlapping and shifting. According to Mark Zacher, \"precisely surveyed national borders only came into clear view in the eighteenth century\". Guntram Herb dates the emergence of clearly defined political territories to the 15th century.\nThe Peace of Westphalia in 1648 is commonly considered to have established territorial integrity as a cornerstone of sovereignty, embodied in the concept of Westphalian sovereignty, but even this did not necessarily reflect any absolute right to particular territory. Even after Westphalia, territorial exchange remained common between states. In turn, these states were culturally diverse and politically disorganized, and people were not collectively identified by state borders.\nThe emergence of nationalism and self-determination in the 18th and 19th centuries began to alter people's perception of the states in which they resided. Nationalism promoted the belief that territory belonged to a nation and that the territorial integrity of a nation should be respected. Guntram Herb argues national identity is \"dependent on territory because only territory provides tangible evidence of the nation's existence and its historical roots, and a nation needs a clearly demarcated national territory to demand its own state\". John Etherington agrees, stating: \"Underlying all nationalist claims over territory is the proposition that nation and territory ultimately belong to each other, to the extent that the characteristic features of each cannot be understood without making reference to the other\". He observes how, because all nationalist movements necessarily make territorial claims in a world marked by competing claims over territory, this becomes an essential part of their self-justification.\nFollowing World War I, the establishment of the League of Nations ushered in a new era of international cooperation. The League's Covenant codified territorial integrity as a key principle of international law. However, the political conditions for maintaining the territorial status quo after the war were not always maintained and various post-war settlements involved exchanges of territory irrespective of local populations.\nWith the formation of the United Nations (UN) and, later, such organizations as the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (now Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe), territorial integrity became a well-established part of international resolutions. The UN Charter of 1945 affirmed states\u2019 obligation not to use force to alter state boundaries. Enforcement difficulties in the 21st century have led to controversy on possible re-emergence of the right of conquest as international law.\nIn a changing world.\nThe recent (post-World War II) strict application of territorial integrity has given rise to a number of problems and, when faced with reality \"on the ground\", can be seen as too artificial a construct.\nAt the 2005 World Summit, the world's nations agreed on a \"Responsibility to Protect\", allowing a right for humanitarian intervention. It has been argued that this could create a flexible application of concepts of sovereignty and territorial integrity, easing the strict adherence and taking into account the \"de facto\" status of the territory and other factors present on a case by case basis. The United Nations Security Council Resolution 1674, adopted by the United Nations Security Council on April 28, 2006, \"Reaffirm[ed] the provisions of paragraphs 138 and 139 of the 2005 World Summit Outcome Document regarding the responsibility to protect populations from genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity\".\nHowever, this responsibility to protect refers only to the ability of external powers to override sovereignty and does not explicitly involve the changing of borders.\nThe International Court of Justice advisory opinion on Kosovo's declaration of independence claims that territorial integrity is not violated as far as international law is concerned by declarations of independence in themselves.\nWriting on the cross-border institutions created in Northern Ireland following the Good Friday Agreement, Cathal McCall observes how these configurations constituted a \"functional transterritorial model of governance for Northern Ireland based on the principles of interdependence, inclusion and consent\" as opposed to the previous \"exclusivist territorial political pillars of modern Irish nationalism and Ulster unionism\". That is, the exclusivist assumptions of territorial integrity, embodied in Irish nationalism and Ulster unionism were blurred by the Agreement's implementation of cross-border decision-making.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The \"tachi\" style of swords preceded the development of the \"katana\", which was not mentioned by name until near the end of the twelfth century. \"Tachi\" were the mainstream Japanese swords of the Kot\u014d period between 900 and 1596. Even after the Muromachi period (1336\u20131573), when \"katana\" became the mainstream, \"tachi\" were often worn by high-ranking samurai.\nHistory.\nThe production of swords in Japan is divided into specific time periods:\nThe predecessor of the Japanese sword has been called \"warabitet\u014d\u200a\". In the middle of the Heian period (794\u20131185), samurai improved on the to develop \"kenukigata-tachi\u200a\" (early Japanese sword). To be more precise, it is thought that the improved the and developed \"Kenukigata-warabitet\u014d\u200a\" with a hole in the hilt and \"kenukigatat\u014d\u200a\" without decorations on the tip of the hilt, and the samurai developed based on these swords. , which was developed in the first half of the 10th century, has a three-dimensional cross-sectional shape of an elongated pentagonal or hexagonal blade called and a gently curved single-edged blade, typical features of Japanese swords. There is no wooden hilt attached to , and the tang (), integrated with the blade, is directly gripped and used. The term is derived from the fact the central part of tang is hollowed in the shape of ancient Japanese tweezers ().\nIn the developed after , a structure in which the hilt is fixed to the tang () with a pin called was adopted. As a result, a sword with three basic external elements of Japanese swords, the cross-sectional shape of , a gently curved single-edged blade, and the structure of , was completed. Its shape may reflect the changing form of warfare in Japan. Cavalry were now the dominant fighting unit, and the older straight were unsuitable for fighting from horseback. The curved sword is a far more efficient weapon wielded by a warrior on horseback; the curve of the blade adds considerably to the downward force of a cutting action. According to historian Karl Friday, before the 13th century, there are no written references or drawings showing swords of any kind were used from horseback. However, According to Yoshikazu Kondo, bow and arrows were certainly the main weapons used in cavalry battles, but from around the Genpei War in the 12th century, the use of on horseback increased. Early models had uneven curves with the deepest part of the curve at the hilt. As eras changed, the center of the curve tended to move up the blade.\nBy the 11th century during the Heian period, were exported to neighboring countries in Asia. For example, in the poem \"The Song of Japanese Swords\", Ouyang Xiu, a statesman of the Song dynasty in China, described Japanese swords as follows: \"It is a treasured sword with a scabbard made of fragrant wood covered with fish skin, decorated with brass and copper, and capable of exorcising evil spirits. It is imported at a great cost.\"\nFrom the Heian period (794\u20131185), ordinary samurai wore swords of the style called (, ), which meant black lacquer . The hilt of a is wrapped in leather or ray skin, and it is wrapped with black thread or leather cord, and the scabbard is coated with black lacquer. On the other hand, court nobles wore decorated with precisely carved metal and jewels for ceremonial purposes. High-ranking court nobles wore swords of the style called or (), which meant decorative , and lower-ranking court nobles wore simplified swords of the style called , which meant thin . The and worn by nobles were initially straight like a , but since the Kamakura period they have had a gentle curve under the influence of . Since worn by court nobles were for ceremonial use, they generally had an iron plate instead of a blade.\nIn the Kamakura period (1185\u20131333), high-ranking samurai wore (, ), which meant a sword with chains in the arsenal. The scabbard of the was covered with a gilt copper plate and hung by chains at the waist. At the end of the Kamakura period, simplified came to be made as an offering to the of Shinto shrines and fell out of use as weapons. On the other hand, in the Kamakura period, there was a type of called () with a scabbard covered with metal, which was used as a weapon until the Muromachi period. The meaning was a sword wrapped around a leech, and its feature was that a thin metal plate was spirally wrapped around the scabbard, so it was both sturdy and decorative, and chains were not used to hang the scabbard around the waist.\nThe Mongol invasions of Japan in the 13th century during the Kamakura period facilitated a change in the designs of Japanese swords. The swordsmiths of the S\u014dsh\u016b school represented by Masamune studied ruined \u2013 broken or bent in battle \u2013 to develop new production methods, and create innovative swords. They forged the blade using a combination of soft and hard steel to optimize the temperature and timing of the heating and cooling of the blade, resulting in a lighter and very robust blade. They also made the curve of the blade gentle, lengthened the tip linearly, widened the width from the cutting edge to the opposite side of the blade, and thinned the cross section to improve the penetration and cutting ability of the blade.\nHistorically in Japan, the ideal blade of a Japanese sword is considered to be the in the Kamakura period, and the swordsmiths from the Edo period to the present day after the period focused on reproducing the blade of a Japanese sword in the Kamakura period. There are more than 100 Japanese swords designated as National Treasures in Japan, of which the of the Kamakura period account for 80% and the account for 70%.\nFrom the end of the Kamakura period to the end of the Muromachi period (1333\u20131573), (), which means a wrapped in leather, was popular. The was stronger than the because its hilt was wrapped in leather or ray skin, lacquer was painted on top of it, leather straps and cords were wrapped around it, and the scabbard and sometimes the (hand guard) were also wrapped in leather.\nBy the 15th century, Japanese swords, including , had already gained international fame by being exported to China and Korea. For example, Koreans learned how to make Japanese swords by sending swordsmiths to Japan and inviting Japanese swordsmiths to Korea. According to the record of June 1, 1430, in the \"Veritable Records of the Joseon Dynasty\", a Korean swordsmith who went to Japan and mastered the method of making Japanese swords presented a Japanese sword to the King of Korea and was rewarded for the excellent work which was no different from the swords made by the Japanese.\nTraditionally, (bows) were the main weapon of war in Japan, and and were for close combat. The \u014cnin War in the late 15th century in the Muromachi period expanded into a large-scale domestic war, in which employed farmers called were mobilized in large numbers. They fought on foot using shorter than . In the Sengoku period (period of warring states) in the late Muromachi period, the war became bigger; fought in a close formation using (spears) lent to them. Furthermore, in the late 16th century, (matchlock arquebuses) were introduced from Portugal, and Japanese swordsmiths mass-produced improved products, with fighting with leased guns. On the battlefield in Japan, guns and spears became main weapons in addition to bows. Due to the changes in fighting styles in these wars, the and became obsolete among samurai, and the , which was easy to carry, became the mainstream. The dazzling-looking gradually became a symbol of the authority of high-ranking samurai.\nFrom the 15th century, low-quality swords were mass-produced under the influence of the large-scale war. These swords, along with spears, were lent to recruited farmers called , while swords were exported. Such mass-produced swords are called , and swordsmiths of the Bisen school and Mino school produced them by division of labor. The export of Japanese sword reached its height during the Muromachi period\u2014at least 200,000 swords were shipped to Ming dynasty China in official trade in an attempt to soak up the production of Japanese weapons and make it harder for pirates in the area to arm. In the Ming dynasty of China, Japanese swords and their tactics were studied to repel pirates, and and were developed based on Japanese swords.\nFrom this period, the tang () of many old were cut and shortened into . This modification is called . For example, many of the Masamune forged during the Kamakura period were converted into , so his only existing works are and .\nFrom around the 16th century, many Japanese swords, including , were exported to Thailand, where -style swords were made and prized for battle and art work, and some of them are in the collections of the Thai royal family.\nIn the Sengoku period (1467\u20131615) or the Azuchi\u2013Momoyama period (1568\u20131600), the (, , which means a wound with thread, appeared and became the mainstream of after that. was decorated with lacquer decorations with many and flashy colored threads, and was used as a gift, a ceremony, or an offering to the of Shinto shrines.\nIn later Japanese feudal history, during the Sengoku and Edo periods, certain high-ranking warriors of the ruling class wore their sword -style (edge-downward), rather than with the scabbard thrust through the belt with the edge upward. This style of swords is called , \"half \". In , styles were often mixed, for example, fastening to the was style, but metalworking of the scabbard was style.\nWith the rise of statism in Sh\u014dwa Japan, the Imperial Japanese Army and the Imperial Japanese Navy implemented swords called , worn style (cutting-edge down).\nIn the Shint\u014d period from around 1596 in the Azuchi\u2013Momoyama period, the traditional techniques of the Kot\u014d period were lost, and no smith was able to reproduce the of the Kamakura period. However, in 2014, Kunihira Kawachi succeeded in reproducing a from the Kamakura period. He received the Masamune Prize, the highest honor as a swordsmith. On the he forged, (a pattern of hazy white shadows between and ), characteristic of the Bizen school in the Kamakura period. Nobody could win the Masamune Prize without extraordinary achievements, and in the field of and , no one won until Kawauchi for 18 years.\nFeatures.\nWith a few exceptions, and can be distinguished from each other, if signed, by the location of the signature () on the tang. In general, the signature should be carved into the side of the tang facing outward as the sword is worn on the wielder's left waist. Since a was worn cutting edge down, and the was worn cutting edge up, the would be in opposite locations on the tang of both types of swords.\nAn authentic had an average cutting edge length () of , and compared to a katana, was generally lighter in proportion to its length, had a greater taper from hilt to point, was more curved and had a smaller point area for penetrating heavy clothing.\nUnlike the traditional manner of wearing the , the was worn hung from the belt with the cutting edge down, and was most effective used by cavalry. Deviations from the average length of have the prefixes \"ko-\" for \"short\" and \"\u014d-\" for \"great, large\" attached. For instance, and closer in size to a were called . The longest (considered a 15th-century ) in existence is in total length with a blade, but is believed to be ceremonial. In the late 1500s and early 1600s, many blades were modified into , their cut tangs () removing the smiths' signatures from the swords.\nFor a sword to be worn in style, it needed to be mounted in a . The has two hangers (ashi) so the sword can be worn in a horizontal position with the cutting edge down. A sword not mounted in a could be worn style by use of a , a leather device allowing any sword to be worn in the style.\nGallery.\nGenerally, the blade and the sword mounting of Japanese swords are displayed separately in museums, and this tendency is remarkable in Japan. For example, the Nagoya Japanese Sword Museum \"Nagoya Touken World\", one of Japan's largest sword museums, posts separate videos of the blade and the sword mounting on its official website and YouTube.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The series was one of the most popular European comics of the 20th century. By 2007, a century after Herg\u00e9's birth, \"Tintin\" had been published in more than 70 languages with sales of more than 200 million copies, and had been adapted for radio, television, theatre, and film.\nThe series first appeared in French on 10 January 1929 in , a youth supplement to the Belgian newspaper . The success of the series led to serialised strips published in Belgium's leading newspaper and spun into a successful \"Tintin\" magazine. In 1950, Herg\u00e9 created Studios Herg\u00e9, which produced the canonical versions of ten \"Tintin\" albums. Following Herg\u00e9's death in 1983, the final instalment of the series, \"Tintin and Alph-Art\", was released posthumously.\nThe series is set in the contemporary world. Its protagonist is Tintin, a courageous young Belgian reporter and adventurer aided by his faithful dog Snowy ( in the original French edition). Other allies include the brash and cynical Captain Haddock, the intelligent but hearing-impaired Professor Calculus (), incompetent detectives Thomson and Thompson (), and the opera diva Bianca Castafiore.\nThe series has been admired for its clean, expressive drawings in Herg\u00e9's signature (\"clear line\") style. Its well-researched plots straddle a variety of genres: swashbuckling adventures with elements of fantasy, mysteries, political thrillers, and science fiction. The stories feature slapstick humour, offset by dashes of political or cultural commentary.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nHistory.\n: 1929\u20131939.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n\"The idea for the character of Tintin and the sort of adventures that would befall him came to me, I believe, in five minutes, the moment I first made a sketch of the figure of this hero: that is to say, he had not haunted my youth nor even my dreams. Although it's possible that as a child I imagined myself in the role of a sort of Tintin\".\n\u2014Herg\u00e9, 15 November 1966.\nGeorges Prosper Remi, best known under the pen name Herg\u00e9, was employed as an illustrator at (\"The Twentieth Century\"), a staunchly Roman Catholic, conservative Belgian newspaper based in Herg\u00e9's native Brussels. Run by the Abb\u00e9 Norbert Wallez, the paper described itself as a \"Catholic Newspaper for Doctrine and Information\" and disseminated a fascist viewpoint. Wallez appointed Herg\u00e9 editor of a new Thursday youth supplement, titled (\"The Little Twentieth\"). Propagating Wallez's sociopolitical views to its young readership, it contained explicitly pro-fascist and antisemitic sentiment. In addition to editing the supplement, Herg\u00e9 illustrated (\"The Extraordinary Adventure of Flup, N\u00e9nesse, Poussette and Cochonnet\"), a comic strip authored by a member of the newspaper's sport staff. Dissatisfied with this, Herg\u00e9 wanted to write and draw his own cartoon strip.\nHe already had experience creating comic strips. From July 1926, he had written a strip about a Boy Scout patrol leader titled (\"The Adventures of Totor, Scout Leader of the Cockchafers\") for the Scouting newspaper (\"The Belgian Boy Scout\"). Totor was a strong influence on Tintin, with Herg\u00e9 describing the latter as being like Totor's younger brother. Jean-Marc and Randy Lofficier stated that graphically, Totor and Tintin were \"virtually identical\" except for the Scout uniform, also noting many similarities between their respective adventures, particularly in the illustration style, the fast pace of the story, and the use of humour. He was fascinated by new techniques in the medium such as the systematic use of speech bubbles\u2014found in such American comics as George McManus' \"Bringing up Father\", George Herriman's \"Krazy Kat\", and Rudolph Dirks's \"Katzenjammer Kids\", copies of which had been sent to him from Mexico by the paper's reporter L\u00e9on Degrelle.\nAlthough Herg\u00e9 wanted to send Tintin to the United States, Wallez ordered him to set his adventure in the Soviet Union, in order to create antisocialist propaganda for children. The result, \"Tintin in the Land of the Soviets\", was serialised in from January 1929 to May 1930. Popular in Francophone Belgium, Wallez organised a publicity stunt at the Paris Gare du Nord railway station, following which he organised the publication of the story in book form. The story's popularity led to an increase in sales, so Wallez granted Herg\u00e9 two assistants. At Wallez's direction, in June he began serialisation of the second story, \"Tintin in the Congo\", designed to encourage colonial sentiment towards the Belgian Congo. Authored in a paternalistic style that depicted the Congolese as childlike idiots, in later decades it was accused of racism, but at the time was uncontroversial and popular, and further publicity stunts were held to increase sales.\nFor the third adventure, \"Tintin in America\", serialised from September 1931 to October 1932, Herg\u00e9 finally got to deal with a scenario of his own choice, and used the work to push an anti-capitalist, anti-consumerist agenda in keeping with the paper's ultraconservative ideology. \"The Adventures of Tintin\" had been syndicated to a Catholic magazine named (\"Brave Hearts\") since 1930, and Herg\u00e9 was soon receiving syndication requests from Swiss and Portuguese newspapers, too.\nHerg\u00e9 wrote a string of \"Adventures of Tintin\", sending his character to real locations such as the Belgian Congo, United States, Egypt, India, Tibet, China, and the United Kingdom. He also sent Tintin to fictional countries of his own devising, such as the Latin American republic of San Theodoros, the East European kingdom of Syldavia, or the fascist state of Borduria\u2014whose leader's name, M\u00fcsstler, was a portmanteau of the names of the Nazi German F\u00fchrer Adolf Hitler and the Italian Fascist Prime Minister Benito Mussolini.\n: 1940\u20131945.\nIn May 1940, Nazi Germany invaded Belgium as World War II spread further across Europe. Although Herg\u00e9 briefly fled to France and was considered a self-imposed exile, he ultimately decided to return to his occupied homeland. For political reasons, the Nazi authorities closed down , leaving Herg\u00e9 unemployed. In search of employment, he got a job as an illustrator at Belgium's leading newspaper, (\"The Evening\"), which was allowed to continue publication under German management. On 17 October 1940, he was made editor of the children's supplement, , in which he set about producing new Tintin adventures. In this new, more repressive political climate of German-occupied Belgium, Herg\u00e9 could no longer politicize \"The Adventures of Tintin\" lest he be arrested by the Gestapo. As Harry Thompson noted, Tintin's role as a reporter came to an end, to be replaced by his new role as an explorer. The serialized publication of \"Land of Black Gold\", which was being released in the years immediately preceding the occupation, was put on hold and its publication would not resume until 1948. Six other stories were released in the meantime, which were notably absent of any explicitly political plot or commentary.\n: 1946\u20131983.\nIn September 1944, the Allies entered Brussels and Herg\u00e9's German employers fled. was shut down and \"The Adventures of Tintin\" was put on hold.\nThen in 1946, Herg\u00e9 accepted an invitation from Belgian comic publisher Raymond Leblanc and his new publishing company to continue \"The Adventures of Tintin\" in the new (\"Tintin\" magazine).\nHerg\u00e9 quickly learned that he no longer had the independence he preferred; he was required to produce two coloured pages a week for Leblanc's magazine, a tall order.\nIn 1950, Herg\u00e9 began to poach the better members of the \"Tintin\" magazine staff to work in the large house on Avenue Louise that contained the fledgling . Bob De Moor (who imitated Herg\u00e9's style and did half the work), Guy Dessicy (colourist), and Marcel DeHaye (secretary) were the nucleus. To this, Herg\u00e9 added Jacques Martin (imitated Herg\u00e9's style), Roger Leloup (detailed, realistic drawings), Eug\u00e8ne Evany (later chief of the Studios), Michel Demaret (letterer), and Baudouin Van Den Branden (secretary).\nAs Harry Thompson observed, the idea was to turn the process of creating \"The Adventures of Tintin\" into a \"veritable production line, the artwork passing from person to person, everyone knowing their part, like an artistic orchestra with Herg\u00e9 conducting\".\nThe studios produced eight new Tintin albums for \"Tintin\" magazine, and coloured and reformatted two old Tintin albums.\n continued to release additional publications until Herg\u00e9's death in 1983. In 1986, a 24th unfinished album was released, the studios were disbanded, and the assets were transferred to the Herg\u00e9 Foundation.\nCharacters.\nTintin and Snowy.\nTintin is a young Belgian reporter and adventurer who becomes involved in dangerous cases in which he takes heroic action to save the day. The \"Adventures\" may feature Tintin hard at work in his investigative journalism, but seldom is he seen actually turning in a story.\nReaders and critics have described Tintin as a well-rounded yet open-ended, intelligent, and creative character, noting that his lack of backstory and neutral personality permits a reflection of the evil, folly, and foolhardiness which surrounds him. The character never compromises his Boy Scout ideals, which represent Herg\u00e9's own, and his status allows the reader to assume his position within the story, rather than merely following the adventures of a strong protagonist. Tintin's cartoonish representation against more realistic backgrounds enhances this aspect, with Scott McCloud noting that it \"allows readers to mask themselves in a character and safely enter a sensually stimulating world\".\nSnowy ( in Herg\u00e9's original version), a white Wire Fox Terrier dog, is Tintin's loyal companion. Like Captain Haddock, Snowy is fond of Loch Lomond brand Scotch whisky, and his occasional bouts of drinking tend to get him into unintentional trouble, as does his only fear: arachnids.\nCaptain Haddock.\nCaptain Archibald Haddock ( in Herg\u00e9's original version) is a Merchant Marine sea captain and Tintin's best friend. Introduced in \"The Crab with the Golden Claws\", Haddock is initially depicted as a weak and alcoholic character, but later evolves to become genuinely heroic and even a socialite after he finds a treasure from his ancestor, Sir Francis Haddock (). The Captain's coarse humanity and sarcasm act as a counterpoint to Tintin's often-implausible heroism; he is always quick with a dry comment whenever the boy reporter seems too idealistic. The hot-tempered Haddock uses a range of colourful insults and curses to express his feelings, such as \"billions of bilious blue blistering barnacles!\" () or \"ten thousand thundering typhoons!\"\nProfessor Calculus.\nProfessor Cuthbert Calculus ( in Herg\u00e9's original version; is the French word for 'sunflower') is an absent-minded and partially deaf physicist and a regular character alongside Tintin, Snowy, and Captain Haddock. He was introduced in \"Red Rackham's Treasure\", and based partially on Auguste Piccard, a Swiss physicist.\nSupporting characters.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n\"Everybody wants to be Tintin: generation after generation. In a world of Rastapopouloses, Tricklers and Carreidases\u2014or, more prosaically, Jolyon Waggs and Bolt-the-builders\u2014Tintin represents an unattainable ideal of goodness, cleanness, authenticity\".\n\u2014Literary critic Tom McCarthy, 2006 \nHerg\u00e9's supporting characters have been cited as far more developed than the central character, each imbued with strength of character and depth of personality, which has been compared with that of the characters of Charles Dickens. Herg\u00e9 used the supporting characters to create a realistic world in which to set his protagonists' adventures. To further the realism and continuity, characters would recur throughout the series. The occupation of Belgium and the restrictions imposed upon Herg\u00e9 forced him to focus on characterisation to avoid depicting troublesome political situations. As a result, the colourful supporting cast was developed during this period.\nThomson and Thompson ( in Herg\u00e9's original version) are two incompetent detectives who look like identical twins, their only discernible difference being the shape of their moustaches. First introduced in \"Cigars of the Pharaoh\", they provide much of the comic relief throughout the series, being afflicted with chronic spoonerisms. They are extremely clumsy, thoroughly incompetent, and usually bent on arresting the wrong character. The detectives usually wear bowler hats and carry walking sticks except when sent abroad; during those missions they attempt the national costume of the locality they are visiting, but instead dress in conspicuously stereotypical folkloric attire which makes them stand apart. The detectives were based partly on Herg\u00e9's father Alexis and uncle L\u00e9on, identical twins who often took walks together, wearing matching bowler hats while carrying matching walking sticks.\nBianca Castafiore is an opera singer of whom Haddock is terrified. She was first introduced in \"King Ottokar's Sceptre\" and seems to appear wherever the protagonists travel, along with her maid Irma and pianist Igor Wagner. Although amiable and strong-willed, she is also comically foolish, whimsical, absent-minded, talkative, and seemingly unaware that her voice is shrill and appallingly loud. Her speciality is the Jewel Song ( / \"Ah! My beauty past compare, these jewels bright I wear\") from Gounod's opera \"Faust\", which she sings at the least provocation. She is often maternal toward Haddock, of whose dislike she remains ignorant. She often confuses words, especially names, with other words that rhyme with them or of which they remind her; \"Haddock\" is frequently replaced by malapropisms such as \"Paddock\", \"Stopcock\", or \"Hopscotch\", while Nestor, Haddock's butler, is confused with \"Chestor\" and \"Hector\". Her own name means \"white and chaste flower\": a meaning to which Professor Calculus once refers when he breeds a white rose and names it for the singer. She was based upon opera divas in general (according to Herg\u00e9's perception), Herg\u00e9's Aunt Ninie (who was known for her \"shrill\" singing of opera), and, in the post-war comics, on Maria Callas.\nOther recurring characters include Nestor the butler, Chang (or Chang-Chong-Chen) the loyal Chinese boy, Rastapopoulos the criminal mastermind, Jolyon Wagg the infuriating (to Haddock) insurance salesman, General Alcazar the South American freedom fighter and (on and off) President of San Theodoros, Mohammed Ben Kalish Ezab the Arab emir, and Abdullah his mischievous son, Dr. M\u00fcller the evil German psychiatrist, Oliveira da Figueira the friendly Portuguese salesman, Cutts the butcher whose phone number is repeatedly confused with Haddock's, and Allan the henchman of Rastapopoulos and formerly Haddock's first mate.\nSettings.\nThe settings within \"Tintin\" have also added depth to the strips. Herg\u00e9 mixes real and fictional lands into his stories. In \"King Ottokar's Sceptre\" (revisited once more in \"Destination Moon\", \"Explorers on the Moon\" and \"The Calculus Affair\") Herg\u00e9 creates two fictional countries, Syldavia and Borduria, and invites the reader to tour them in text through the insertion of a travel brochure into the storyline. Other fictional lands include Khemed on the Arabian Peninsula and San Theodoros, S\u00e3o Rico, and Nuevo Rico in South America, as well as the kingdom of Gaipajama in India. Apart from these fictitious locations, Tintin also visits real places such as Switzerland, the United Kingdom, the United States, the Soviet Union, Belgian Congo, Peru, India, Egypt, Morocco, Indonesia, Iceland, Nepal, Tibet, and China. Other actual locales used were the Sahara Desert, the Atlantic Ocean, and the Moon.\nFictional settings include:\nResearch.\nHerg\u00e9's extensive research began with \"The Blue Lotus\"; Herg\u00e9 said that \"it was from that time that I undertook research and really interested myself in the people and countries to which I sent Tintin, out of a sense of responsibility to my readers\".\nHerg\u00e9's use of research and photographic reference allowed him to build a realised universe for Tintin, going so far as to create fictionalised countries, dressing them with specific political cultures. These were heavily informed by the cultures evident in Herg\u00e9's lifetime. Pierre Skilling has asserted that Herg\u00e9 saw monarchy as \"the legitimate form of government\", noting that democratic \"values seem underrepresented in [such] a classic Franco-Belgian strip\". Syldavia in particular is described in considerable detail, Herg\u00e9 creating a history, customs, and a language, which is actually a Slavic-looking transcript of Marols, a working-class Brussels dialect. He set the country in the Balkans, and it is, by his own admission, modelled after Albania. The country finds itself threatened by neighbouring Borduria, with an attempted annexation appearing in \"King Ottokar's Sceptre\". This situation parallels the Italian conquest of Albania, and that of Czechoslovakia and Austria by expansionist Nazi Germany prior to World War II.\nHerg\u00e9's use of research would include months of preparation for Tintin's voyage to the Moon in the two-part storyline spread across \"Destination Moon\" and \"Explorers on the Moon\". His research for the storyline was noted in \"New Scientist\": \"The considerable research undertaken by Herg\u00e9 enabled him to come very close to the type of space suit that would be used in future Moon exploration, although his portrayal of the type of rocket that was actually used was a long way off the mark\". The Moon rocket is based on the German V-2 rockets.\nInfluences.\nIn his youth, Herg\u00e9 admired Benjamin Rabier and suggested that a number of images within \"Tintin in the Land of the Soviets\" reflected his influence, particularly the pictures of animals. Ren\u00e9 Vincent, the Art Deco designer, also affected early Tintin adventures: \"His influence can be detected at the beginning of the \"Soviets\", where my drawings are designed along a decorative line, like an 'S'\". Herg\u00e9 also readily adopted the image of round noses from George McManus, feeling they were \"so much fun that I used them, without scruples!\"\nDuring the extensive research Herg\u00e9 carried out for \"The Blue Lotus\", he became influenced by Chinese and Japanese illustrative styles and woodcuts. This is especially noticeable in the seascapes, which are reminiscent of works by Hokusai and Hiroshige.\nHerg\u00e9 also declared Mark Twain an influence, although this admiration may have led him astray when depicting Incas as having no knowledge of an upcoming solar eclipse in \"Prisoners of the Sun\", an error T.\u00a0F. Mills attributed to an attempt to portray \"Incas in awe of a latter-day 'Connecticut Yankee'\".\nTranslation into English.\nBritish.\nTintin first appeared in English in the weekly British children's comic \"Eagle\" in 1951 with the story \"King Ottokar's Sceptre\". It was translated in conjunction with Casterman, Tintin's publishers, and starts by describing Tintin as \"a French boy\". Snowy was called by his French name .\nThe process of translating Tintin into British English was then commissioned in 1958 by Methuen, Herg\u00e9's British publishers. It was a joint operation, headed by Leslie Lonsdale-Cooper and Michael Turner, who worked closely with Herg\u00e9 to attain a translation as true as possible to the original work. Due in part to the large amount of language-specific word play (such as punning) in the series, especially the jokes which played on Professor Calculus' partial deafness, it was never the intention to translate literally; instead they strove to fashion a work whose idioms and jokes would be meritorious in their own right. Despite the free hand Herg\u00e9 afforded the two, they worked closely with the original text, asking for regular assistance to understand Herg\u00e9's intentions.\nThe British translations were also Anglicised to appeal to British customs and values. Milou, for example, was renamed Snowy at the translators' discretion. Captain Haddock's was renamed Marlinspike Hall.\nWhen it came time to translate \"The Black Island\", which is set in Great Britain, the opportunity was taken to redraw the entire book. Methuen had decided that the book did not portray Great Britain accurately enough and had compiled a list of 131 errors of detail which needed to be put right, such as ensuring that the British police were unarmed and ensuring that scenes of the British countryside would be acceptable to British readers. The resulting 1966 album is the dramatically updated and redrawn version most commonly available today. As of the early 21st century,[ [update]] Egmont publishes Tintin books in the United Kingdom and elsewhere.\nAmerican.\nThe \"Tintin\" books have had relatively limited popularity in the United States.\nThe works were first adapted for the American English market by Golden Books, a branch of the Western Publishing Company in the 1950s. The albums were translated from French into American English with some artwork panels blanked except for the speech balloons. This was done to remove content considered to be inappropriate for children, such as drunkenness and free mixing of races. The albums were not popular and only six were published in mixed order. The edited albums later had their blanked areas redrawn by Herg\u00e9 to be more acceptable, and they currently appear this way in published editions around the world.\nFrom 1966 to 1979, \"Children's Digest\" included monthly instalments of \"The Adventures of Tintin\". These serialisations served to increase Tintin's popularity, introducing him to many thousands of new readers in the United States.\nAtlantic Monthly Press, in cooperation with Little, Brown and Company beginning in the 1970s, republished the albums based on the British translations. Alterations were made to vocabulary not well known to an American audience (such as gaol, tyre, saloon, and spanner). As of the early 21st century,[ [update]] Little, Brown and Company (owned by the Hachette Book Group USA) continues to publish Tintin books in the United States.\nDigital.\nMoulinsart's official Tintin app in Apple's App Store, launched with the release of the digital version of \"Tintin in the Congo\" on 5 June 2015, features brand new English language translations by journalist, writer and Tintin expert Michael Farr.\nLettering and typography.\nThe English-language \"Adventures of Tintin\" books were originally published with handwritten lettering created by cartographer Neil Hyslop. 1958's \"The Crab with the Golden Claws\" was the first to be published with Hyslop's lettering. Hyslop was given versions of Herg\u00e9's artwork with blank panels. Hyslop would write his English script on a clear cellophane-like material, aiming to fit within the original speech bubble. Occasionally the size of the bubbles would need to be adjusted if the translated text would not fit. In the early 2000s, Tintin's English publishers Egmont discontinued publishing books featuring Hyslop's handwritten lettering, instead publishing books with text created with digital fonts. This change was instigated by publisher Casterman and Herg\u00e9's estate managers Moulinsart, who decided to replace localised hand-lettering with a single computerised font for all Tintin titles worldwide.\nReception.\nAwards.\nOn 1 June 2006, the Dalai Lama bestowed the International Campaign for Tibet's Light of Truth Award upon the Herg\u00e9 Foundation, along with South African Archbishop Desmond Tutu. The award was in recognition of Herg\u00e9's book \"Tintin in Tibet\", Herg\u00e9's most personal adventure, which the executive director of ICT Europe Tsering Jampa noted was \"for many\u00a0... their introduction to the awe-inspiring landscape and culture of Tibet\". In 2001, the Herg\u00e9 Foundation demanded the recall of the Chinese translation of the work, which had been released with the title \"Tintin in Chinese Tibet\". The work was subsequently published with the correct translation of the title. Accepting on behalf of the Herg\u00e9 Foundation, Herg\u00e9's widow Fanny Rodwell said: \"We never thought that this story of friendship would have a resonance more than 40 years later\".\nLiterary criticism.\nThe study of Tintin, sometimes referred to as \"Tintinology\", has become the life work of some literary critics in Belgium, France and the United Kingdom. Belgian author Philippe Goddin has written (1986, later republished in English as \"Herg\u00e9 and Tintin Reporters: From \"Le Petit Vingti\u00e8me\" to \"Tintin\" Magazine\" in 1987) and (1993) amongst other books on the series. In 1983, French author Beno\u00eet Peeters released , subsequently published in English as \"Tintin and the World of Herg\u00e9\" in 1988. English reporter Michael Farr has written works such as \"Tintin, 60 Years of Adventure\" (1989), \"Tintin: The Complete Companion\" (2001), \"Tintin &amp; Co.\" (2007) and \"The Adventures of Herg\u00e9\" (2007), while English television producer Harry Thompson authored \"Tintin: Herg\u00e9 and his Creation\" (1991).\nLiterary critics, primarily in French-speaking Europe, have also examined \"The Adventures of Tintin\". In 1984, Jean-Marie Apostolid\u00e8s published his study of the \"Adventures of Tintin\" from a more \"adult\" perspective as , published in English as \"The Metamorphoses of Tintin, or Tintin for Adults\" in 2010. In reviewing Apostolid\u00e8s' book, Nathan Perl-Rosenthal of \"The New Republic\" thought that it was \"not for the faint of heart: it is densely-packed with close textual analysis and laden with psychological jargon\". Following Apostolid\u00e8s's work, French psychoanalyst Serge Tisseron examined the series in his books (\"Tintin and the Family Secrets\"), which was published in 1990, and (\"Tintin and Herg\u00e9's Secret\"), published in 1993.\nThe first English-language work of literary criticism devoted to the series was \"Tintin and the Secret of Literature\", written by the novelist Tom McCarthy and published in 2006. McCarthy compares Herg\u00e9's work with that of Aeschylus, Honor\u00e9 de Balzac, Joseph Conrad, and Henry James and argues that the series contains the key to understanding literature itself. McCarthy considered the \"Adventures of Tintin\" to be \"stupendously rich\", containing \"a mastery of plot and symbol, theme and sub-text\" which, influenced by Tisseron's psychoanalytical readings of the work, he believed could be deciphered to reveal a series of recurring themes, ranging from bartering to implicit sexual intercourse that Herg\u00e9 had featured throughout the series. Reviewing the book in \"The Telegraph\", Toby Clements argued that McCarthy's work, and literary criticism of Herg\u00e9's comic strips in general, cut \"perilously close\" to simply feeding \"the appetite of those willing to cross the line between enthusiast and obsessive\" in the Tintinological community.\nControversy.\nThe earliest stories in \"The Adventures of Tintin\" have been criticised for animal cruelty; colonialism; violence; and ethnocentric, caricatured portrayals of non-Europeans. While the Herg\u00e9 Foundation has presented such criticism as na\u00efvet\u00e9 and scholars of Herg\u00e9 such as Harry Thompson have said that \"Herg\u00e9 did what he was told by the Abb\u00e9 Wallez\", Herg\u00e9 himself felt that his background made it impossible to avoid prejudice, stating: \"I was fed the prejudices of the bourgeois society that surrounded me\".\nIn \"Tintin in the Land of the Soviets\", the Bolsheviks were presented as villains. Herg\u00e9 drew on \"Moscow Unveiled\", a work given to him by Wallez and authored by Joseph Douillet, the former Belgian consul in Russia, that is highly critical of the Soviet regime, although Herg\u00e9 contextualised this by noting that in Belgium, at the time a devout Catholic nation, \"anything Bolshevik was atheist\". In the story, Bolshevik leaders are motivated by personal greed and a desire to deceive the world. Tintin discovers, buried, \"the hideout where Lenin, Trotsky, and Stalin have collected together wealth stolen from the people\". In 1999, the issue of Tintin's politics was the subject of a debate in the French parliament; this event prompted the British weekly newspaper \"The Economist\" to publish an editorial on the matter.\n\"Tintin in the Congo\" has been criticised as presenting the Africans as na\u00efve and primitive. In the original work, Tintin is shown at a blackboard addressing a class of African children: \"My dear friends. I am going to talk to you today about your fatherland: Belgium\". Herg\u00e9 redrew this in 1946 to show a lesson in mathematics. Herg\u00e9 later admitted the flaws in the original story, excusing it saying: \"I portrayed these Africans according to\u00a0... this purely paternalistic spirit of the time\". Sue Buswell, who was the editor of Tintin at Methuen, summarised the perceived problems with the book in 1988 as \"all to do with rubbery lips and heaps of dead animals\", although Thompson noted her quote may have been \"taken out of context\".\nDrawing on Andr\u00e9 Maurois' , Herg\u00e9 presents Tintin as a big-game hunter, accidentally killing fifteen antelope as opposed to the one needed for the evening meal. However, concerns over the number of dead animals led \"Tintin\"'s Scandinavian publishers to request changes. A page of Tintin killing a rhinoceros by drilling a hole in its back and inserting a stick of dynamite was deemed excessive; Herg\u00e9 replaced the page with one in which the rhino accidentally discharges Tintin's rifle while he sleeps under a tree. In 2007, the UK's Commission for Racial Equality called for the book to be pulled from shelves after a complaint, stating: \"It beggars belief that in this day and age Borders would think it acceptable to sell and display Tintin in the Congo.\" In August 2007, a Congolese student filed a complaint in Brussels that the book was an insult to the Congolese people. Public prosecutors investigated, and a criminal case was initiated, although the matter was transferred to a civil court. Belgium's Centre for Equal Opportunities warned against \"over-reaction and hyper political correctness\".\nHerg\u00e9 altered some of the early albums in subsequent editions, usually at the demand of publishers. For example, at the instigation of his American publishers, many of the African characters in \"Tintin in America\" were re-coloured to make their race Caucasian or ambiguous. \"The Shooting Star\" originally had an American villain with the Jewish surname of \"Blumenstein\". This proved controversial, as the character exhibited exaggerated, stereotypically Jewish characteristics. \"Blumenstein\" was changed to an American with a less ethnically specific name, Mr. Bohlwinkel, in later editions and subsequently to a South American of a fictional country S\u00e3o Rico. Herg\u00e9 later discovered that 'Bohlwinkel' was also a Jewish name. In recent years, even Tintin's politics of peace have been investigated.\nAdaptations and memorabilia.\n\"The Adventures of Tintin\" has been adapted in a variety of media besides the original comic strip and its collections. Herg\u00e9 encouraged adaptations and members of his studio working on the animated films. After Herg\u00e9's death in 1983, the Herg\u00e9 Foundation and Moulinsart, the foundation's commercial and copyright wing, became responsible for authorising adaptations and exhibitions.\nTelevision and radio.\nTwo animated television adaptations and one radio adaptation have been made.\n\"Herg\u00e9's Adventures of Tintin\" () (1957) was the first production of Belvision Studios. Ten of Herg\u00e9's books were adapted, each serialised into a set of five-minute episodes, with 103 episodes produced. The series was directed by Ray Goossens and written by Belgian comic artist Greg, later editor-in-chief of \"Tintin\" magazine, and produced by Raymond Leblanc. Most stories in the series varied widely from the original books, often changing whole plots.\n\"The Adventures of Tintin\" () (1991\u201392) was the more successful \"Tintin\" television series. An adaptation of twenty-one \"Tintin\" books, it was directed by St\u00e9phane Bernasconi and was produced by Ellipse (France) and Canadian Nelvana on behalf of the Herg\u00e9 Foundation. The series adhered closely to the albums to such an extent that panels from the original were often transposed directly to the screen. The series aired in over fifty countries and was released on DVD. It aired in the US on HBO.\n\"The Adventures of Tintin\" (1992\u201393) radio series was produced by BBC Radio 5. The dramas starred Richard Pearce as Tintin and Andrew Sachs as Snowy. Captain Haddock was played by Leo McKern in Series One and Lionel Jeffries in Series Two, Professor Calculus was played by Stephen Moore and Thomson and Thompson were played by Charles Kay.\nThe \"Adventures of Tintin\" were also released as radio dramas on LP and compact cassette recordings in French language versions in Belgium, France and Canada, German language versions in Germany, Swedish language versions in Sweden, Danish language versions in Denmark and Norwegian language versions in Norway.\nCinema.\nFive feature-length \"Tintin\" films were made before Herg\u00e9's death in 1983 and one more in 2011.\n\"The Crab with the Golden Claws\" () (1947) was the first successful attempt to adapt one of the comics into a feature film. Written and directed by Claude Misonne and Jo\u00e3o B Michiels, the film was a stop-motion puppet production created by a small Belgian studio.\n\"Tintin and the Golden Fleece\" () (1961), the first live-action \"Tintin\" film, was adapted not from one of Herg\u00e9's \"Adventures of Tintin\" but instead from an original script written by Andr\u00e9 Barret and R\u00e9mo Forlani. Directed by Jean-Jacques Vierne and starring Jean-Pierre Talbot as Tintin and Georges Wilson as Haddock, the plot involves Tintin travelling to Istanbul to collect the \"Golden Fleece\", a ship left to Haddock in the will of his friend, Themistocle Paparanic. Whilst in the city however, Tintin and Haddock discover that a group of villains also want possession of the ship, believing that it would lead them to a hidden treasure.\n\"Tintin and the Blue Oranges\" () (1964), the second live action \"Tintin\" film, was released due to the success of the first. Again based upon an original script, once more by Andr\u00e9 Barret, it was directed by Philippe Condroyer and starred Talbot as Tintin and Jean Bouise as Haddock. The plot reveals a new invention, the blue orange, that can grow in the desert and solve world famines, devised by Calculus' friend, the Spanish Professor Zalamea. An emir whose interests are threatened by the invention of the blue orange proceeds to kidnap both Zalamea and Calculus, and Tintin and Haddock travel to Spain in order to rescue them.\n\"Tintin and the Temple of the Sun\" () (1969), the first traditional animation \"Tintin\" film, was adapted from two of Herg\u00e9's \"Adventures of Tintin\": \"The Seven Crystal Balls\" and \"Prisoners of the Sun\". The first full-length, animated film from Raymond Leblanc's Belvision, which had recently completed its television series based upon the Tintin stories; it was directed by Eddie Lateste and featured a musical score by the critically acclaimed composer Fran\u00e7ois Rauber. The adaptation is mostly faithful, although the \"Seven Crystal Balls\" portion of the story was heavily condensed.\n\"Tintin and the Lake of Sharks\" () (1972), the second traditional animation \"Tintin\" film and the last Tintin release for nearly 40 years, it was based on an original script by Greg and directed by Raymond Leblanc. Belvision's second feature takes Tintin to Syldavia to outwit his old foe Rastapopoulos. While the look of the film is richer, the story is less convincing. The movie was subsequently adapted into a comic album made up of stills from the film.\n\"\" (2011) was Steven Spielberg's motion capture 3D film based on three Herg\u00e9 albums: \"The Crab with the Golden Claws\" (1941), \"The Secret of the Unicorn\" (1943), and \"Red Rackham's Treasure\" (1944). Peter Jackson's company Weta Digital provided the animation and special effects. The movie received positive reviews and was a box office success.\nDocumentaries.\n\"I, Tintin\" (, 1976) was produced by Belvision Studios and Pierre Film.\n\"Tintin and I\" (, 2003), a documentary film directed by Anders H\u00f8gsbro \u00d8stergaard and co-produced by companies from Denmark, Belgium, France, and Switzerland, was based on a taped interview with Herg\u00e9 by Numa Sadoul from 1971. Although the interview was published as a book, Herg\u00e9 was allowed to edit the work prior to publishing and much of the interview was excised. Years after Herg\u00e9's death, the filmmaker returned to the original tapes and restored Herg\u00e9's often personal, insightful thoughts\u2014and in the process brought viewers closer to the world of Tintin and Herg\u00e9. It was broadcast in the US on the PBS network on 11 July 2006.\n (\"On the trail of Tintin\", 2010) was a five-part documentary television series which recaps several albums of the book series by combining comic panels (motionless or otherwise) with live-action imagery, with commentary provided.\nTheatre.\nHerg\u00e9 himself helped to create two stage plays, collaborating with humourist Jacques Van Melkebeke. \"Tintin in the Indies: The Mystery of the Blue Diamond\" (1941) covers much of the second half of \"Cigars of the Pharaoh\" as Tintin attempts to rescue a stolen blue diamond. \"Mr. Boullock's Disappearance\" (1941\u20131942) has Tintin, Snowy, and Thomson and Thompson travel around the world and back to Brussels again to unmask an impostor trying to lay claim to a missing millionaire's fortune. The plays were performed at the in Brussels. The scripts of the plays are lost.\nIn the late 1970s and early 1980s, two Tintin plays were produced at the Arts Theatre in the West End of London, adapted by Geoffrey Case for the Unicorn Theatre Company. These were \"Tintin's Great American Adventure\", based on the comic \"Tintin in America\" (1976\u20131977) and \"Tintin and the Black Island\", based on \"The Black Island\" (1980\u201381); this second play later toured.\nA musical based on \"The Seven Crystal Balls\" and \"Prisoners of the Sun\" premi\u00e8red on 15 September 2001 at the (City Theatre) in Antwerp, Belgium. It was entitled (\"Tintin \u2013 Temple of the Sun (The Musical)\") and was broadcast on Canal Plus, before moving on to Charleroi in 2002 as .\nThe Young Vic theatre company in London ran \"Herg\u00e9's Adventures of Tintin\", a musical version of \"Tintin in Tibet\", at the Barbican Arts Centre (2005\u20132006); the production was directed by Rufus Norris and was adapted by Norris and David Greig. The show was successfully revived at the Playhouse Theatre in the West End of London before touring (2006\u20132007) to celebrate the centenary of Herg\u00e9's birth in 2007.\nVideo games.\nTintin began appearing in video games when Infogrames, a French game company, released the side scroller \"Tintin on the Moon\" in 1989. The same company released a platform game titled \"Tintin in Tibet\" in 1995 for the Super NES and Mega Drive/Genesis. Another platform game from Infogrames titled \"Prisoners of the Sun\" was released the following year for the Super NES, Microsoft Windows, and Game Boy Color.\nIn 2001, Tintin became 3D in ', released by Infogrames for Windows and PlayStation. Then in 2011, an action-adventure game called ', a tie-in to the 2011 movie, was released by Ubisoft in October. In 2020, a match-3 mobile game called \"Tintin Match\" was released by 5th Planet games. An adventure game, titled \"Tintin Reporter \u2013 Cigars of the Pharaoh\", was released by Microids in 2023.\nMemorabilia and merchandise.\nImages from the series have long been licensed for use on merchandise, the success of \"Tintin\" magazine helping to create a market for such items. Tintin's image has been used to sell a wide variety of products, from alarm clocks to underpants. Countless separate items related to the character have been available, with some becoming collector's items in their own right.\nThe Herg\u00e9 Foundation has maintained control of the licenses, through Moulinsart (now Tintin Imaginatio), the commercial wing of the foundation. Speaking in 2002, Peter Horemans, the then director general at Moulinsart, noted this control: \"We have to be very protective of the property. We don't take lightly any potential partners and we have to be very selective\u00a0... for him to continue to be as popular as he is, great care needs to be taken of his use\". However, the Foundation has been criticised by scholars as \"trivialising the work of Herg\u00e9 by concentrating on the more lucrative merchandising\" in the wake of a move in the late 1990s to charge them for using relevant images to illustrate their papers on the series.\nTintin memorabilia and merchandise has allowed a chain of stores based solely on the character to become viable. The first shop was launched in 1984 in Covent Garden, London. Tintin shops have also opened in both Bruges and Brussels in Belgium, and in Montpellier, France. In 2014, a Tintin shop opened in Taguig, the Philippines, only the second of its kind in Southeast Asia. The first Tintin shop in Southeast Asia opened in Singapore in 2010.\nThe British bookstore chain, Ottakar's, founded in 1987, was named after the character of King Ottokar from the Tintin book \"King Ottokar's Sceptre\", and their shops stocked a large amount of Tintin merchandise until their takeover by Waterstone's in 2006.\nStamps and coins.\nTintin's image has been used on postage stamps on numerous occasions.\nThe first \"Tintin\" postage stamp was an eight-franc stamp issued by Belgian Post for the 50th anniversary of the publication of Tintin's first adventure on 29 September 1979, featuring Tintin and Snowy looking through a magnifying glass at several stamps.\nIn 1999, a nine-stamp block celebrating ten years of the Belgian Comic Strip Center was issued, with the center stamp a photo of Tintin's famous Moon rocket that dominates the Comic Strip Center's entry hall.\nTo mark the end of the Belgian Franc and to celebrate the seventieth anniversary of the publication of \"Tintin in the Congo\", two more stamps were issued by Belgian Post on 31 December 2001: Tintin in a pith helmet and a souvenir sheet with a single stamp in the center. The stamps were jointly issued in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.\nIn 2004, Belgian Post celebrated its own seventy-fifth anniversary, as well as the fiftieth anniversary of the publication of \"Explorers on the Moon\", and the thirty-fifth anniversary of the Moon landings with a souvenir sheet of five stamps based upon the \"Explorers on the Moon\" adventure.\nTo celebrate the centenary of Herg\u00e9's birth in 2007, Belgian Post issued a sheet of 25 stamps depicting the album covers of all 24 \"Adventures of Tintin\" (in 24 languages) plus Herg\u00e9's portrait in the center.\nA souvenir sheet of ten stamps called \"Tintin on screen\", issued 30 August 2011, depicts the \"Tintin\" film and television adaptations.\nTintin has also been commemorated by coin several times.\nIn 1995, the (Paris Mint) issued a set of twelve gold medallions, available in a limited edition of 5000.\nA silver medallion was minted in 2004 to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the Tintin book \"Explorers on the Moon\", again in a limited run, this time of 10,000. It quickly sold out.\nIn 2004, Belgium minted a limited edition commemorative euro coin featuring Tintin and Snowy celebrating the 75th anniversary of Tintin's first adventure in January 2004. Although it has a face value of \u20ac10, it is, as with other commemorative euro coins, legal tender only in the country in which it was issued\u2014in this case, Belgium.\nIn 2006\u20132012 France issued the Comic Strip Heroes commemorative coin series featuring famous Franco-Belgian comics, beginning in 2006 with \"Tintin\".\nIt was a set of six different euro coins honouring Herg\u00e9: three 1\u00bd-euro silver coins featuring Tintin and the Professor, Tintin and Captain Haddock, and Tintin and Chang; a \u20ac10 (gold) featuring Tintin; and a \u20ac20 (silver) and a \u20ac50 (gold) featuring Tintin and Snowy. In 2007, on Herg\u00e9's centenary, Belgium issued its \u20ac20 (silver) Herg\u00e9/Tintin coin.\nParody and pastiche.\nDuring Herg\u00e9's lifetime, parodies were produced of the \"Adventures of Tintin\", with one of the earliest appearing in Belgian newspaper \"La Patrie\" after the liberation of the country from Nazi German occupation in September 1944. Entitled (\"Tintin in the Land of the Nazis\"), the short and crudely drawn strip lampoons Herg\u00e9 for working for a Nazi-run newspaper during the occupation.\nFollowing Herg\u00e9's death, hundreds more unofficial parodies and pastiches of the \"Adventures of Tintin\" were produced, covering a wide variety of different genres. Tom McCarthy divided such works into three specific groupings: pornographic, political, and artistic. In a number of cases, the actual name \"Tintin\" is replaced by something similar, like Nitnit, Timtim, or Quinquin, within these books.\nMcCarthy's first group, pornographic parodies, includes 1976's (\"Tintin in Switzerland\") and Jan Bucquoy's 1992 work (\"Tintin's Sex Life\"), featuring Tintin and the other characters engaged in sexual acts. Another such example was \"Tintin in Thailand\", in which Tintin, Haddock, and Calculus travel to the East Asian country for a sex holiday. The book began circulating in December 1999, but in 2001, Belgian police arrested those responsible and confiscated 650 copies for copyright violation.\nOther parodies have been produced for political reasons: for instance, \"Tintin in Iraq\" lampoons the world politics of the early 21st century, with Herg\u00e9's character General Alcazar representing President of the United States George W. Bush. Written by the pseudonymous Jack Daniels, \"\" (1989) is a revolutionary socialist comic set in Britain during the 1980s, with Tintin and his uncle (modelled after Captain Haddock) being working class Englishmen who turn to socialism in order to oppose the capitalist policies of the Conservative Party government of Margaret Thatcher. When first published in Britain, it caused an outrage in the mainstream press, with one paper issuing the headline that \"Commie nutters turn Tintin into picket yob!\"\nOther comic creators have chosen to create artistic stories that are more like fan fiction than parody. The Swiss artist Exem created the irreverent comic adventures of Zinzin, what \"The Guardian\" calls \"the most beautifully produced of the pastiches.\" Similarly, Canadian cartoonist Yves Rodier has produced a number of Tintin works, none of which have been authorised by the Herg\u00e9 Foundation, including a 1986 \"completion\" of the unfinished \"Tintin and Alph-art\", which he drew in Herg\u00e9's style.\nThe response to these parodies has been mixed in the Tintinological community. Many despise them, seeing them as an affront to Herg\u00e9's work. Nick Rodwell of the Herg\u00e9 Foundation took this view, declaring that \"none of these copyists count as true fans of Herg\u00e9. If they were, they would respect his wishes that no one but him draw Tintin's adventures\". Where possible, the foundation has taken legal action against those known to be producing such items. Others have taken a different attitude, considering such parodies and pastiches to be tributes to Herg\u00e9, and collecting them has become a \"niche specialty\".\nAs of 1 January 2025, Tintin and other characters appearing in the 1929 comic strips have entered the public domain in the United States, but not in Herg\u00e9's native Belgium, which will be in 2054. The French artist Fabrice Sapolsky has announced his plans for a 1929 Tintin reboot.\nHowever, for Alain Berenboom, lawyer for the Herg\u00e9 Foundation, according to the Berne Convention, Tintin will enter the public domain in 2034.\nExhibitions.\nAfter Herg\u00e9's death in 1983, his art began to be honoured at exhibitions around the world, keeping \"Tintin\" awareness at a high level.\nThe first major \"Tintin\" exhibition in London was \"Tintin: 60 years of Adventure\", held in 1989 at the Town Hall in Chelsea. This early exhibition displayed many of Herg\u00e9's original sketches and inks, as well as some original gouaches.\nIn 2001, an exhibition entitled (\"Billions of Blistering Barnacles!\") was shown at the Mus\u00e9e national de la Marine in Paris.\nIn 2002, the Bunkamura Museum of Art in Tokyo staged an exhibition of original Herg\u00e9 drawings as well as of the submarine and rocket ship invented in the strips by Professor Calculus.\nThe National Maritime Museum in Greenwich, London, hosted the exhibition \"The Adventures of Tintin at Sea\" in 2004, focusing on Tintin's sea exploits, and in commemoration of the 75th anniversary of the publication of Tintin's first adventure.\n2004 also saw an exhibition in the Halles Saint-G\u00e9ry/Sint-Gorikshallen in Brussels titled \"Tintin et la ville\" (\"Tintin and the City\") showcasing all cities in the world Tintin had travelled.\nThe Belgian Comic Strip Center in the Brussels business district added exhibits dedicated to Herg\u00e9 in 2004.\nThe Brussels' Comic Book Route in the center of Brussels added its first \"Tintin\" mural in July 2005.\nThe centenary of Herg\u00e9's birth in 2007 was commemorated at the largest museum for modern art in Europe, the Centre Georges Pompidou in Paris, with \"Herg\u00e9\", an art exhibition honouring his work. The exhibition, which ran from 20 December 2006 until 19 February 2007, featured some 300 of Herg\u00e9's boards and original drawings, including all 124 original plates of \"The Blue Lotus\".\nLaurent le Bon, organiser of the exhibit said: \"It was important for the Centre to show the work of Herg\u00e9 next to that of Matisse or Picasso\". Michael Farr claimed: \"Herg\u00e9 has long been seen as a father figure in the comics world. If he's now recognised as a modern artist, that's very important\".\n2009 saw the opening of the Herg\u00e9 Museum (), designed in contemporary style, in the town of Louvain-la-Neuve, south of Brussels. Visitors follow a sequence of eight permanent exhibit rooms covering the entire range of Herg\u00e9's work, showcasing the world of Tintin and his other creations. In addition, the new museum has already seen many temporary exhibits, including \"Into Tibet With Tintin\".\nLegacy.\nHerg\u00e9 is recognised as one of the leading cartoonists of the twentieth century. Most notably, Herg\u00e9's style has been influential to creators of other Franco-Belgian comics. Contributors to \"Tintin\" magazine have employed , and later artists Jacques Tardi, Yves Chaland, Jason Little, Phil Elliott, Martin Handford, Geof Darrow, Eric Heuvel, Garen Ewing, Joost Swarte, and others have produced works using it.\nIn the wider art world, both Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein have claimed Herg\u00e9 as one of their most important influences. Lichtenstein made paintings based on fragments from \"Tintin\" comics, whilst Warhol used and even made a series of paintings with Herg\u00e9 as the subject. Warhol, who admired Tintin's \"great political and satirical dimensions\", said, \"Herg\u00e9 has influenced my work in the same way as Walt Disney. For me, Herg\u00e9 was more than a comic strip artist\".\nHerg\u00e9 has been lauded as \"creating in art a powerful graphic record of the 20th century's tortured history\" through his work on Tintin, whilst Maurice Horn's \"World Encyclopedia of Comics\" declares him to have \"spear-headed the post-World War II renaissance of European comic art\". French philosopher Michel Serres noted that the twenty-three completed Tintin albums constituted a \"\" (\"masterpiece\") to which \"the work of no French novelist is comparable in importance or greatness\".\nIn 1966, Charles de Gaulle said: \"Basically, you know, my only international rival is Tintin! We are the little ones who don't let themselves be fooled by the big ones\".\nIn March 2015, Brussels Airlines painted an Airbus A320-200 with registration OO-SNB in a special Tintin livery.\nIn 2015, a tall sculpture of the rocket featured in Tintin: Destination Moon was unveiled at Brussels Airport.\nTintin has become a symbol of Belgium and so was used in a variety of visual responses to the 2016 Brussels bombings.\nIn 2024, the Royal Belgian Football Association unveiled a Tintin-inspired kit for the Belgian national football team.

Tecumseh is about southwest of Detroit, south of Ann Arbor, and north of Toledo, Ohio. The main street of downtown is Chicago Boulevard, also designated as M-50. It crosses the River Raisin a few miles east of M-52.\nThe city is surrounded on three sides by Tecumseh Township, but the two are politically independent. Raisin Township borders the southern edge of the city. In 2009 the city was rated by CNNMoney as #93 among the 100 best small towns to live in.\nHistory.\nThe boundaries of Lenawee County were laid out by a proclamation of the Territorial Governor, Lewis Cass, on September 10, 1822. Lenawee remained attached to Monroe County, out of which it was formed, until an act of the Territorial Legislature passed on December 26, 1826, organized the county government.\nThe first Anglo-American settlement in the county was made two years earlier, on May 21, 1824, in Tecumseh. The settlers, consisting of fifteen men, eleven women, and six children, all came from Jefferson County, New York along Lake Erie. In 1823, Musgrove Evans had located the land and persuaded General Joseph W. Brown and the others to move to the site. Brown and Evans, along with Austin Eli Wing, purchased land there and platted the village of Tecumseh in 1824.\nThese founders appealed to Governor Cass to locate the county seat of Lenawee at Tecumseh. This was accomplished by an act of the Territorial Legislature on June 30, 1824, although county government was not organized for another year and a half. The city was named after Shawnee chief Tecumseh, whose people had historically controlled that territory.\nTecumseh remained the county seat until 1838, when it was transferred to Adrian. The Township of Tecumseh was organized on April 12, 1837, initially encompassing the entire northern third of the county.\nJust to the north of Tecumseh, the village of Brownville was established in 1823 by Austin Wing. It was annexed by Tecumseh in 1838.\nGeography.\nTecumseh is located in Southeast Michigan. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water.\nDemographics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"US Census population/styles.css\"/&gt;\n2010 census.\nAs of the census of 2010, there were 8,521 people, 3,604 households, and 2,304 families residing in the city. The population density was . There were 3,957 housing units at an average density of . The racial makeup of the city was 96.0% White, 0.4% African American, 0.4% Native American, 0.7% Asian, 0.8% from other races, and 1.6% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 4.4% of the population.\nThere were 3,604 households, of which 32.4% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 49.0% were married couples living together, 11.3% had a female householder with no husband present, 3.6% had a male householder with no wife present, and 36.1% were non-families. 31.2% of all households were made up of individuals, and 14.1% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.35 and the average family size was 2.96.\nThe median age in the city was 39.8 years. 24.7% of residents were under the age of 18; 7.1% were between the ages of 18 and 24; 25.4% were from 25 to 44; 27.4% were from 45 to 64; and 15.5% were 65 years of age or older. The gender makeup of the city was 46.8% male and 53.2% female.\n2000 census.\nAs of the census of 2000, there were 8,574 people, 3,499 households, and 2,337 families residing in the city. The population density was . There were 3,651 housing units at an average density of . The racial makeup of the city was 95.85% White, 0.19% African American, 0.63% Native American, 0.69% Asian, 0.01% Pacific Islander, 1.49% from other races, and 1.14% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 4.40% of the population.\nThere were 3,499 households, out of which 33.9% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 52.8% were married couples living together, 10.5% had a female householder with no husband present, and 33.2% were non-families. 28.5% of all households were made up of individuals, and 12.2% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.42 and the average family size was 2.99.\nIn the city, the population was spread out, with 26.4% under the age of 18, 7.5% from 18 to 24, 29.4% from 25 to 44, 21.5% from 45 to 64, and 15.1% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 36 years. For every 100 females, there were 92.6 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 87.2 males.\nThe median income for a household in the city was $46,106, and the median income for a family was $58,239. Males had a median income of $39,672 versus $27,630 for females. The per capita income for the city was $22,797. About 3.5% of families and 4.9% of the population were below the poverty line, including 3.9% of those under age 18 and 7.4% of those age 65 or over.\nEconomy.\nOne of the village's best known manufacturers was Tecumseh Products. Founded by the Herrick family during the early part of the 20th century, Tecumseh Products initially began business manufacturing refrigeration compressors, leading Tecumseh to be known as the \"Refrigeration Capital of the World.\" The company moved out of Tecumseh in 2008. It moved its remaining production to a plant in Tupelo, Mississippi, where labor costs were lower because workers were unorganized. It moved its headquarters to Pittsfield Township, Michigan, just outside Ann Arbor, where the University of Michigan is based.\nConsolidated Biscuit Company of McComb, Ohio, agreed to buy the Products plant in 2008, pending an environmental review. But, the deal fell through after Consolidated Biscuit Company was sold. The site was found to be contaminated and cleanup begun in 2017. The land was purchased by a local developer - 100 E. Patterson LLC - with plans to clean up the land to brownfield status and develop mixed-use space for light industrial, commercial and retail. The State of Michigan Department of Environmental Quality (MDEQ) awarded the City of Tecumseh $2,000,000 in funding to aid the developer in cleanup efforts.\nAt the end of 2018, demolition at the site was nearly complete and cleanup efforts were underway with new industrial building construction planned for 2019.\nOverall, the City of Tecumseh's economy has more than 250 businesses, ranging from Tier 1 Automotive Suppliers to small, locally owned bakeries and shoe stores. The downtown along Chicago Boulevard is thriving with businesses ranging from antiques, breweries and wineries, retail, restaurants, customer jewelers, locally owned department stores and more.\nArts and culture.\nAnnual cultural events.\nIn 2010, the city began hosting the Tecumseh Ice Sculpting Festival in the downtown area on the penultimate weekend in January. Another festival is Appleumpkin (held the second weekend in October to celebrate harvest); it attracts approximately 30,000 tourists annually from around the region.\nThe city of Tecumseh holds several other events each year, such as the Classic Car and Bike Show, Divas at Dusk, Holiday Open House, Annual Pet Parade and Sidewalk Sales.\nTecumseh celebrates the annual Art Trail. This features sculptures throughout Tecumseh, which are changed on an annual basis. The related annual Art Walk pairs local artists and merchants.\nThe Carnegie Preservation League is a local non-profit that saved a historical landmark building and renovated it to create lofts and gallery space for local artists.\nTourism.\nThe Southern Michigan Railroad Society operates a railroad as a living museum; the route runs through Tecumseh.\nTourists also come for the city's proximity to the Michigan International Speedway (M.I.S.). The M-50 corridor has many antique dealers, cafes and fine dining restaurants.\nEducation.\nThe city of Tecumseh is home to Tecumseh Public Schools. The system includes one traditional high school, Tecumseh High School (grades 9\u201312); one alternative high school, Tecumseh Alternative High School; one middle school, Tecumseh Middle School (grades 5-8); two early education elementary (grades Y5, K-2) schools, Sutton Early Learning Center and Tecumseh Acres Early Learning Center; and two intermediate elementary (grades 3-4) schools, Patterson Intermediate Learning Center and Herrick Park Intermediate Learning Center.\nTecumseh students have access to the Lenawee Intermediate School District (LISD) and the Southern Michigan Center for Science and Industry. Tecumseh Public Schools seeks to provide myriad educational opportunities to create a work-ready workforce, including industry-specific programs to focus on the needs of area businesses.\nTecumseh Public Schools has a graduation rate of 96.84%, with more than 65% of graduates enrolling in post-secondary education. Tecumseh's central location provides easy access to major universities, including the top 10 that graduates choose: Jackson College, Washtenaw Community College, Eastern Michigan University, Michigan State University, Central Michigan University, Siena Heights University, Western Michigan University, the University of Michigan, all in Michigan, and the University of Toledo in Ohio.\nDon Juan.\nA horse, Don Juan, that belonged to General George Armstrong Custer is buried in Tecumseh.

{"id": "31340", "revid": "49941710", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31340", "title": "The Mythical Man-Month", "text": "1975 software engineering book by Fred Brooks\nThe Mythical Man-Month: Essays on Software Engineering is a book on software engineering and project management by Fred Brooks first published in 1975, with subsequent editions in 1982 and 1995. Its central theme is that adding manpower to a software project that is behind schedule delays it even longer. This idea is known as Brooks's law, and is presented along with the second-system effect and advocacy of prototyping.\nBrooks's observations are based on his experiences at IBM while managing the development of OS/360. He had added more programmers to a project falling behind schedule, a decision that he would later conclude had, counter-intuitively, delayed the project even further. He also made the mistake of asserting that one project\u2014involved in writing an ALGOL compiler\u2014would require six months, regardless of the number of workers involved (it required longer). The tendency for managers to repeat such errors in project development led Brooks to quip that his book is called \"The Bible of Software Engineering\", because \"everybody quotes it, some people read it, and a few people go by it\".\nEditions.\nThe work was first published in 1975 (),&lt;ref name=\"eecs.umich.edu/~weimerw\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; reprinted with corrections in 1982, and republished in an anniversary edition with four extra chapters in 1995 (), including a reprint of the essay \"No Silver Bullet\" with commentary by the author.\nIdeas presented.\nThe mythical man-month.\nBrooks discusses several causes of scheduling failures. The most enduring is his discussion of Brooks's law:\n\"Adding manpower to a late software project makes it later\". Man-month is a hypothetical unit of work representing the work done by one person in one month; Brooks's law says that the possibility of measuring useful work in man-months is a myth, and is hence the centerpiece of the book.\nComplex programming projects cannot be perfectly partitioned into discrete tasks that can be worked on without communication between the workers and without establishing a set of complex interrelationships between tasks and the workers performing them.\nTherefore, assigning more programmers to a project running behind schedule will make it even later. This is because the time required for the new programmers to learn about the project and the increased communication overhead will consume an ever-increasing quantity of the calendar time available. When \"n\" people have to communicate among themselves, as \"n\" increases, their output decreases and when it becomes negative the project is delayed further with every person added.\nNo silver bullet.\nBrooks added the chapter \"No Silver Bullet\u2014Essence and Accidents in Software Engineering\" and further reflections on it in the chapter \"'No Silver Bullet' Refired\" to the anniversary edition of \"The Mythical Man-Month\".\nBrooks insists that there is no one silver bullet: \"there is no single development, in either technology or management technique, which by itself promises even one order of magnitude [tenfold] improvement within a decade in productivity, in reliability, in simplicity.\"\nThe argument relies on the distinction between accidental complexity and essential complexity, similar to the way Amdahl's law relies on the distinction between \"parallelizable\" and \"strictly serial\".\nThe second-system effect.\nThe second-system effect proposes that, when an architect designs a second system, it is the most dangerous system they will ever design, because they will tend to incorporate all of the additions they originally did not add to the first system due to inherent time constraints. Thus, when embarking on a second system, an engineer should be mindful that they are susceptible to over-engineering it.\nThe tendency toward irreducible number of errors.\nThe author makes the observation that in a suitably complex system there is a certain irreducible number of errors. Any attempt to fix observed errors tends to result in the introduction of other errors.\nProgress tracking.\nBrooks wrote \"Question: How does a large software project get to be one year late? Answer: One day at a time!\" Incremental slippages on many fronts eventually accumulate to produce a large overall delay. Continued attention to meeting small individual milestones is required at each level of management.\nConceptual integrity.\nTo make a user-friendly system, the system must have conceptual integrity, which can only be achieved by separating architecture from implementation. A single chief architect (or a small number of architects), acting on the user's behalf, decides what goes in the system and what stays out. The architect or team of architects should develop an idea of what the system should do and make sure that this vision is understood by the rest of the team. A novel idea by someone may not be included if it does not fit seamlessly with the overall system design. In fact, to ensure a user-friendly system, a system may deliberately provide \"fewer\" features than it is capable of. The point being, if a system is too complicated to use, many features will go unused because no one has time to learn them.\nThe manual.\nThe chief architect produces a manual of system specifications. It should describe the external specifications of the system in detail, that is everything that the user sees. The manual should be altered as feedback comes in from the implementation teams and the users.\nThe pilot system.\nWhen designing a new kind of system, a team \"will\" design a throw-away system (whether it intends to or not). This system acts as a \"pilot plan\" that reveals techniques that will subsequently cause a complete redesign of the system. This second, \"smarter\" system should be the one delivered to the customer, since delivery of the pilot system would cause nothing but agony to the customer, and possibly ruin the system's reputation and maybe even the company.\nFormal documents.\nEvery project manager should create a small core set of formal documents defining the project objectives, how they are to be achieved, who is going to achieve them, when they are going to be achieved, and how much they are going to cost. These documents may also reveal inconsistencies that are otherwise hard to see.\nProject estimation.\nWhen estimating project times, it should be remembered that programming products (which can be sold to paying customers) and programming systems are both three times as hard to write as simple independent in-house programs. It should be kept in mind how much of the work week will actually be spent on technical issues, as opposed to administrative or other non-technical tasks, such as meetings, and especially \"stand-up\" or \"all-hands\" meetings.\nCommunication.\nTo avoid disaster, all the teams working on a project should remain in contact with each other in as many ways as possible (e-mail, phone, meetings, memos, etc.). Instead of assuming something, implementers should ask the architect(s) to clarify their intent on a feature they are implementing, before proceeding with an assumption that might very well be completely incorrect. The architect(s) are responsible for formulating a group picture of the project and communicating it to others.\nThe surgical team.\nMuch as a surgical team during surgery is led by one surgeon performing the most critical work, while directing the team to assist with less critical parts, it seems reasonable to have a \"good\" programmer develop critical system components while the rest of a team provides what is needed at the right time. Additionally, Brooks muses that \"good\" programmers are generally five to ten times as productive as mediocre ones.\nCode freeze and system versioning.\nSoftware is invisible. Therefore, many things only become apparent once a certain amount of work has been done on a new system, allowing a user to experience it. This experience will yield insights, which will change a user's needs or the perception of the user's needs. The system should, therefore, be changed to fulfill the changed requirements of the user. This can only occur up to a certain point, otherwise the system may never be completed. At a certain date, no more changes should be allowed to the system and the code should be frozen. All requests for changes should be delayed until the \"next\" version of the system.\nSpecialized tools.\nInstead of every programmer having their own special set of tools, each team should have a designated tool-maker who may create tools that are highly customized for the job that team is doing (e.g. a code generator tool that creates code based on a specification). In addition, system-wide tools should be built by a common tools team, overseen by the project manager.\nLowering software development costs.\nThere are two techniques for lowering software development costs that Brooks writes about:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "31341", "revid": "47406457", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31341", "title": "Tupac Shakur", "text": "American rapper (1971\u20131996)\nTupac Amaru Shakur ( ; born Lesane Parish Crooks; June 16, 1971 \u2013 September 13, 1996), also known by his stage names 2Pac and Makaveli, was an American rapper and actor. He is widely regarded as one of the greatest rappers of all time, one of the most influential musical artists of the 20th century, and a prominent political activist for Black America. He is among the best-selling music artists, having sold more than 75 million records worldwide. Some of Shakur's music addressed social injustice, political issues, and the marginalization of African Americans, but he was also synonymous with gangsta rap and violent lyrics.\nShakur was born in New York City to parents who were Black Panther Party members. Raised by his mother, Afeni Shakur, he relocated to the San Francisco Bay Area in 1988. His debut album \"2Pacalypse Now\" (1991) cemented him as a central figure in West Coast hip-hop for his political rap lyrics. Shakur achieved further critical and commercial success with his subsequent albums \"Strictly 4 My N.I.G.G.A.Z...\" (1993) and \"Me Against the World\" (1995). His Diamond-certified album \"All Eyez on Me\" (1996), the first hip-hop double album, abandoned introspective lyrics for volatile gangsta rap. It yielded two \"Billboard\" Hot 100-number one singles, \"California Love\" and \"How Do U Want It\". Alongside his solo career, Shakur formed the group Thug Life and collaborated with artists like Snoop Dogg, Dr. Dre, and the Outlawz. As an actor, Shakur starred in the films \"Juice\" (1992), \"Poetic Justice\" (1993), \"Above the Rim\" (1994), \"Bullet\" (1996), \"Gridlock'd\" (1997), and \"Gang Related\" (1997).\nDuring his later career, Shakur was shot five times in the lobby of a New York recording studio and experienced legal troubles, including incarceration. He served eight months in prison on sexual abuse charges, but was released pending appeal in 1995. Following his release, he signed to Marion \"Suge\" Knight's label Death Row Records and became embroiled in the East Coast\u2013West Coast hip-hop rivalry, which included a high-profile feud with his former friend the Notorious B.I.G. On September 7, 1996, Shakur was shot four times by an unidentified assailant in a drive-by shooting in Paradise, Nevada; he died six days later. Rumors circulated suggesting that the Notorious B.I.G. was involved; he was murdered in another drive-by shooting six months later in March 1997, while visiting Los Angeles.\nShakur's double-length posthumous album \"Greatest Hits\" (1998) is one of his two releases\u2014and one of only nine hip-hop albums\u2014to have been certified Diamond in the United States. Five more albums have been released since Shakur's death, including the acclaimed \"\" (1996) under the stage name Makaveli, all of which have been certified multi-platinum in the United States. In 2002, Shakur was inducted into the Hip-Hop Hall of Fame. In 2017, he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in his first year of eligibility. \"Rolling Stone\" ranked Shakur among the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time. In 2023, he was awarded a posthumous star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. His influence in music, activism, songwriting, and other areas of culture has been the subject of academic studies.\nEarly life.\nBirth and ancestry.\nTupac Amaru Shakur was born on June 16, 1971, in East Harlem, Manhattan, New York City, to Afeni Shakur and Billy Garland. Born Lesane Parish Crooks, at age one he was renamed Tupac Amaru Shakur. He was named after T\u00fapac Amaru II, a descendant of the last Inca ruler, who was executed in Peru in 1781 after his revolt against Spanish rule. Shakur's mother Afeni Shakur explained, \"I wanted him to have the name of revolutionary, indigenous people in the world. I wanted him to know he was part of a world culture and not just from a neighborhood.\" Tupac's surname came from Lumumba Shakur, a Sunni Muslim, whom his mother married in November 1968. Their marriage fell apart when it was discovered that Lumumba was not Tupac's biological father.\nShakur's parents, Afeni Shakur\u2014born Alice Faye Williams (January 10, 1947 \u2013 May 2, 2016) in North Carolina\u2014and his biological father, William \"Billy\" Garland (born March 14, 1949), had been active Black Panther Party members in New York in the late 1960s and early 1970s. A month before Shakur's birth, his mother was tried in New York City as part of the Panther 21 criminal trial. She was acquitted of over 150 charges.\nOther family members who were involved in the Black Panthers' Black Liberation Army were convicted of serious crimes and imprisoned, including Shakur's stepfather, Mutulu Shakur, who spent four years as one of the FBI's Ten Most Wanted Fugitives. Mutulu was apprehended in 1986 and subsequently convicted for a 1981 robbery of a Brinks armored truck, during which police officers and a guard were killed. Shakur's godfather, Elmer \"Geronimo\" Pratt, a high-ranking Black Panther, was wrongly convicted of murdering a schoolteacher during a 1968 robbery. After he spent 27 years in prison, his conviction was overturned due to the prosecution's having concealed evidence that proved his innocence. Shakur's godmother, Assata Shakur, was a former member of the Black Liberation Army who was convicted in 1977 of the first-degree murder of a New Jersey State Trooper. She escaped from prison in 1979 and was on the FBI Most Wanted Terrorists list in 2013, and would remain on the list up until her death in 2025.\n1971-1988: Early life.\nIn the 1980s, Shakur's mother found it difficult to find work and struggled with drug addiction. In 1984, his family moved from New York City to Baltimore, Maryland. Beginning in 1984, when Shakur was 13, he lived in the Pen Lucy neighborhood with his mother and younger sister at 3955 Greenmount Ave. The home was a two-story rowhouse that had been subdivided into two separate rental units; the Shakur family lived on the first floor. After his death, the block was renamed Tupac Shakur Way.\nWhile living in Baltimore, Shakur attended eighth grade at Roland Park Middle School, then ninth grade at Paul Laurence Dunbar High School. He transferred to the Baltimore School for the Arts in the tenth grade, where he studied acting, poetry, jazz, and ballet. He performed in Shakespeare plays\u2014the themes of which he identified in patterns of gang warfare\u2014and as the Mouse King in \"The Nutcracker\" ballet. At the Baltimore School for the Arts, Shakur befriended actress Jada Pinkett, who became the subject of some of his poems (\"Jada\" and \"The Tears in Cupid's Eyes\"). With his friend Dana \"Mouse\" Smith as a beatbox, he won competitions for the school's best rapper. Known for his humor, he was popular with all crowds of students. He listened to a diverse range of music that included Kate Bush, Culture Club, Sin\u00e9ad O'Connor, and U2.\nUpon connecting with the Baltimore Young Communist League USA, Shakur dated Mary Baldridge, who was the daughter of the director of the local chapter of the Communist Party USA. In 1988, Shakur moved to Marin City, California, an impoverished community in the San Francisco Bay Area. In nearby Mill Valley, he attended Tamalpais High School, where he performed in several theater productions. Shakur did not graduate from high school, but later earned his GED.\nMusic career.\n1988-1991: Early career.\nShakur began recording under the stage name MC New York in 1988. That year, he began attending the poetry classes of Leila Steinberg, and she soon became his manager. Steinberg organized a concert for Shakur and his rap group Strictly Dope. Steinberg managed to get Shakur signed by Atron Gregory, manager of the rap group Digital Underground. In 1990, Gregory placed him with the Underground as a roadie and backup dancer. At the request of Steinberg, Digital Underground co-founder Jimi \"Chopmaster J\" Dright worked with Shakur, Ray Luv and Dize, a DJ, on their earliest studio recordings. Dright recalls that Shakur did not work well as part of a group, and added, \"this guy was on a mission. From day one. Maybe he knew he wasn't going to be around seven years later.\" From 1988 to 1991, Dright and Digital Underground produced Shakur's earliest work with his crew at the time, Strictly Dope. The recordings were rediscovered in 2000 and released as \"The Lost Tapes: Circa 1989.\" Afeni Shakur sued to stop the sale of the recordings but the suit was settled in June 2001 and rereleased as \".\"\nShakur debuted under the stage name 2Pac on Digital Underground, under a new record label, Interscope Records, on the group's January 1991 single \"Same Song\". The song was featured on the soundtrack of the 1991 film \"Nothing but Trouble\", starring Dan Aykroyd, John Candy, Chevy Chase, and Demi Moore. He also appeared with the group in the film, marking Shakur's first film appearance credited as a cameo by the Digital Underground. \"Same Song\" opened the group's January 1991 EP titled \"This Is an EP Release\", while Shakur appeared in the music video. Shakur's early days with Digital Underground made him acquainted with Randy \"Stretch\" Walker, who along with his brother, dubbed Majesty, and a friend debuted with an EP as a rap group and production team, Live Squad, in Queens, New York. Stretch was featured on a track of the Digital Underground's 1991 album \"Sons of the P\". Becoming fast friends, Shakur and Stretch recorded and performed together often.\n1991-1993: \"2Pacalypse Now\".\nShakur's debut album, \"2Pacalypse Now\"\u2014alluding to the 1979 film \"Apocalypse Now\"\u2014arrived in November 1991. Compared to Digital Underground's works, the album explored contemporary social issues in American society at the time, including racism, police brutality, poverty, gang violence, teenage pregnancy and drug abuse. The album generated controversy when Ronald Ray Howard murdered a Texas Highway Patrol trooper and his defense attorney claimed he was influenced by \"2Pacalypse Now\" and its strong theme of police brutality. U.S. vice president Dan Quayle criticized the album, making the statement, \"There's no reason for a record like this to be released. It has no place in our society.\" Tupac, finding himself misunderstood, explained, in part:&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;I just wanted to rap about things that affected young black males. When I said that, I didn't know that I was gonna tie myself down to just take all the blunts and hits for all the young black males, to be the media's kicking post for young black males.Despite controversies, \"2Pacalypse Now\" was certified Gold, and peaked at No. 64 on the \"Billboard\" 200 and No. 13 on the Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums. Three singles were released: \"Trapped\", \"Brenda's Got a Baby\" (No. 23 on Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs and No. 3 on Hot Rap Songs), and \"If My Homie Calls\" (No. 3 on Hot Rap Songs). Some prominent rappers\u2014like Nas, Eminem, Game, and Talib Kweli\u2014cite it as an inspiration. Aside from \"If My Homie Calls\", the singles \"Trapped\" and \"Brenda's Got a Baby\" poetically depict individual struggles under socioeconomic disadvantage.\nIn 1992, he starred in \"Juice\", marking Shakur's first acting role, in which he plays the fictional Roland Bishop, a militant and haunting individual. \"Rolling Stone\"'s Peter Travers calls him \"the film's most magnetic figure\". Multiple actors had auditioned for the role of Roland Bishop, but none were considered right for the role. Shakur accompanied Money-B to the audition and asked producer Neal H. Moritz to read. He was given 15 minutes to rehearse before the audition and secured the role.\n1993-1994: \"Strictly 4 My N.I.G.G.A.Z...\", film career, and The Notorious B.I.G..\nShakur's second album, \"Strictly 4 My N.I.G.G.A.Z...\", was released in February 1993. A critical and commercial success, it debuted at No. 24 on the pop albums chart, the \"Billboard\" 200. An overall more hardcore album, it emphasizes Tupac's sociopolitical views, and has a metallic production quality. The song \"Last Wordz\" features Ice Cube, co-writer of N.W.A's \"Fuck tha Police\", who in his own solo albums had newly gone militantly political, and gangsta rapper Ice-T, who in June 1992 had sparked controversy with his band Body Count's track \"Cop Killer\". The album carries the single \"I Get Around\", a party anthem featuring Digital Underground's Shock G and Money-B, which became Shakur's breakthrough, reaching No. 11 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100. The album also carries the optimistic compassion of another hit, \"Keep Ya Head Up\", an anthem for women's empowerment, charting No. 12 on the \"Billboard Hot 100\". The album's fourth and final hit, \"Papa'z Song\", peaked at No. 87 on \"Billboard 200\". The album was certified Platinum by April 1995, with a million copies sold.\nThat same year, Shakur starred in his second film role alongside Janet Jackson in John Singleton's romance film, \"Poetic Justice,\" and played a gangster called Birdie in the 1994 film \"Above the Rim\". A growing film career, he was initially selected for a few films. Director Allen Hughes had cast Shakur as Sharif in the 1993 film \"Menace II Society\" but replaced him once Shakur assaulted him on set due to a discrepancy with the script. Nonetheless, in 2013, Hughes appraises that Shakur would have outshone the other actors \"because he was bigger than the movie\". Singleton initially cast Shakur in his 1995 film \"Higher Learning\", but was fired because the studio would not finance the film following his arrest. He also had Shakur in the lead role as mind in the 2001 film \"Baby Boy\", a role played by Tyrese Gibson. Ultimately, after his death, the set design includes a Shakur mural in the protagonist's bedroom, and the film's score includes Shakur's song \"Hail Mary\".\nIn 1993, while visiting Los Angeles, the Notorious B.I.G. asked a local drug dealer to introduce him to Shakur and they quickly became friends. The pair would socialize when Shakur went to New York or B.I.G. to Los Angeles. During this period, at his own live shows, Shakur would call B.I.G. onto stage to rap with him and Stretch. Reportedly, B.I.G. asked Shakur to manage him, whereupon Shakur advised him that Sean Combs would make him a star. Yet in the meantime, Shakur's lifestyle was comparatively lavish to B.I.G. who had not yet established himself. Shakur had a falling out with B.I.G. after Shakur was shot at Quad Studios in 1994.\n1995: \"Me Against the World\".\nShakur's third album, \"Me Against the World\", was released while he was incarcerated in March 1995. It is now hailed as his magnum opus, and commonly ranks among the greatest, most influential rap albums. The album debuted at No. 1 on the \"Billboard\" 200 and sold 240,000 copies in its first week, setting a then record for highest first-week sales for a solo male rapper.\nThe lead single, \"Dear Mama\", was released in February 1995 with \"Old School\" as the B-side. It is the album's most successful single, topping the Hot Rap Singles chart, and peaking at No. 9 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100. In July, it was certified Platinum. It ranked No. 51 on the year-end charts. The second single, \"So Many Tears\", was released in June 1995, reaching No. 6 on the Hot Rap Singles chart and No. 44 on Hot 100. The final single, \"Temptations\", was released in August 1995. It reached No. 68 on the Hot 100, No. 35 on the Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Singles &amp; Tracks, and No. 13 on the Hot Rap Singles. Several celebrities showed their support for Shakur by appearing in the music video for \"Temptations\".\nShakur won best rap album at the 1996 Soul Train Music Awards. In 2001, it ranked 4th among his total albums in sales, with about 3\u00a0million copies sold in the U.S.\n1995-1996: \"All Eyez on Me\" and \"Tha Don Killuminati: The 7 Day Theory\".\nWhile Shakur was imprisoned in 1995, his mother was about to lose her house. Shakur had his wife Keisha Morris contact Death Row Records founder Suge Knight in Los Angeles. Reportedly, Shakur's mother promptly received $15,000. After an August visit to Clinton Correctional Facility in northern New York state, Knight traveled southward to New York City to attend the 2nd Annual Source Awards ceremony. Meanwhile, an East Coast\u2013West Coast hip-hop rivalry was brewing between Death Row and Bad Boy Records. In October 1995, Knight visited Shakur in prison again and posted $1.4\u00a0million bond. Shakur returned to Los Angeles and joined Death Row with the appeal of his December 1994 conviction pending.\nShakur's fourth album, \"All Eyez on Me\", arrived on February 13, 1996. It was rap's first double album\u2014meeting two of the three albums due in Shakur's contract with Death Row\u2014and bore five singles. The album shows Shakur rapping about the gangsta lifestyle, leaving behind his previous political messages. With standout production, the album has more party tracks and often a triumphant tone. Music journalist Kevin Powell noted that Shakur, once released from prison, became more aggressive, and \"seemed like a completely transformed person\".\nAs Shakur's second album to hit No. 1 on both the Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums chart and the pop albums chart, the \"Billboard\" 200, it sold 566,000 copies in its first week and was it was certified 5\u00d7 Multi-Platinum in April. The singles \"How Do U Want It\" and \"California Love\" reached No. 1 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100. Death Row released Shakur's diss track \"Hit 'Em Up\" as the non-album B-side to \"How Do U Want It\". In this venomous tirade, the proclaimed \"Bad Boy killer\" threatens violent payback on all things Bad Boy \u2014 B.I.G., Sean Combs, Junior M.A.F.I.A., the company \u2014 and on any in the East Coast rap scene, like rap duo Mobb Deep and rapper Chino XL, who allegedly had commented against Shakur about the dispute. Posthumously, \"All Eyez on Me\" won R&amp;B/Soul or Rap Album of the Year at the 1997 Soul Train Music Awards, Favorite Rap/Hip-Hop Artist at the 1997 American Music Awards, and the album was certified 9\u00d7 Multi-Platinum in June 1998, and 10\u00d7 in July 2014.\nAt the time of his death, a fifth solo album was already finished, \"\", under the stage name Makaveli. It had been recorded during the summer of 1996 and released that year. The lyrics were written and recorded in three days, and mixing took another four days. In 2005, MTV.com ranked \"The 7 Day Theory\" at No. 9 among hip-hop's greatest albums ever, and by 2006 a classic album. Its singular poignance, through hurt and rage, contemplation and vendetta, resonate with many fans. According to George \"Papa G\" Pryce, Death Row Records' then director of public relations, the album was meant to be \"underground\", and was not intended for release before the artist was murdered. It peaked at No. 1 on \"Billboard\"'s Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums chart and on the \"Billboard\" 200, with the second-highest debut-week sales total of any album that year. On June 15, 1999, it was certified 4\u00d7 Multi-Platinum.\nSoon after Shakur's death, three more films starring him were released, \"Bullet\" (1996), \"Gridlock'd\" (1997), and \"Gang Related\" (1997).\nPosthumous albums.\nLater posthumous albums are archival productions, these albums are:\nPoetry collection.\nBefore and during his hip-hop career, Shakur wrote dozens of poems. Some of the most notable are \"Can U C The Pride in The Panther\", \"If I fail\", \"Family Tree\", and \"The Rose that grew from the concrete\". In 1993 Tupac played a character named \"Lucky\" in the film titled \"Poetic Justice\" alongside Janet Jackson. Poet and activist Maya Angelou, who worked with Martin Luther King Jr. and Malcolm X during the civil rights movement, wrote the poems used in the 1993 film.\nIn April 2022, handwritten poems written by Tupac when he was 11 years old were up for sale for US$300,000 but only sold for $90,000. The poems were for Jamal Joseph and three other Black Panther Party members while they were incarcerated at Leavenworth Prison. Even at his young age, Shakur's writing dealt with themes such as black liberation, mass incarceration, race, and masculinity. The poems feature a self-portrait of Shakur sleeping, pen in hand, dreaming of the Black Panthers being freed from prison, and signed with a heart and the phrase \"Tupac Shakur, Future Freedom Fighter\".\nIn October, 2023, sexually explicit poems he wrote to Jada Pinkett Smith while in prison went public in the book \"Tupac Shakur: The Authorized Biography.\" Pinkett Smith celebrated Shakur's 50th birthday by showing an unreleased poem on Instagram called \"Lost Soulz.\" According to Rolling Stone writer Andy Green: \"He was also a poet and activist who became one of his era's most revolutionary voices.\" Tupac had passion for theater and admiration of William Shakespeare. Years after Tupac's death, Nas said \"I put Tupac beyond Shakespeare.\"\nPersonal life.\nShakur became close friends with Jada Pinkett while attending the Baltimore School for the Arts. He helped Pinkett land her first movie role in the film \"Menace II Society\" (1993). In turn, Pinkett secured Shakur a guest starring role on the sitcom \"A Different World\" in 1993. She appeared in his music videos \"Keep Ya Head Up\" and \"Temptations\". She also came up with the concept for his \"California Love\" music video and had intended to direct it, but removed herself from the project. In 1995, Pinkett contributed $100,000 towards Shakur's bail as he awaited an appeal on his sexual abuse conviction. Pinkett later revealed that she turned down his marriage proposal while he was incarcerated at Rikers Island in 1995. Speaking about Pinkett, Shakur stated: \"Jada is my heart. She will be my friend for my whole life. We'll be old together. Jada can ask me to do anything and she can have it.\" Pinkett said Shakur was \"one of my best friends. He was like a brother. It was beyond friendship for us. The type of relationship we had, you only get that once in a lifetime\". Shakur befriended Treach when they were both roadies on Public Enemy's tour in 1990. He made a cameo in Naughty by Nature's music video \"Uptown Anthem\" in 1992. Treach collaborated on Shakur's song \"5 Deadly Venomz\" and appeared in the music video for Shakur's \"Temptations\". Treach was also a speaker at a public memorial service for Shakur in 1996.\nIn 1993, during a police raid of Shakur's room at New York City's Parker Meridian Hotel, a videotape was confiscated which showed Shakur having sex with his then-girlfriend Desiree Smith. Officers were attempting to build their case against Shakur for the alleged sodomy of Ayanna Jackson. In 2022, Smith insisted she was neither underage nor intoxicated at the time of their tryst. In 2011, a sex tape featuring Shakur receiving oral sex from a groupie while rapping and dancing along to one of his own unreleased songs, was sold to a private collector. The video, which was filmed in 1993, also features rapper Money B from Digital Underground. That same year, on an interview with \"The Source\", Shakur criticized record producer Quincy Jones for his interracial marriage to actress Peggy Lipton. Their daughter Rashida Jones responded with an irate open letter. Shakur later apologized to her sister Kidada Jones, whom he began dating in 1996. Shakur and Jones attended Men's Fashion Week in Milan and walked the runway together for a Versace fashion show. Jones was at their hotel in Las Vegas when Shakur was shot.\nAfter Shakur was shot in 1994, he recuperated at Jasmine Guy's home. They had met during his guest appearance on the sitcom \"A Different World\" in 1993. Guy appeared in his music video \"Temptations\" and later wrote his mother's 2004 biography, \"Afeni Shakur: Evolution of a Revolutionary\". In his 1995 interview with \"Vibe\" magazine, Shakur listed Jada Pinkett, Jasmine Guy, Treach and Mickey Rourke among the people who were looking out for him while he was in prison. Shakur also mentioned that Madonna was a supportive friend. Madonna later revealed that they had dated in 1994. Shakur and Rourke formed a bond while filming the movie \"Bullet\" in 1994. Rourke recalled that Shakur \"was there for me during some very hard times.\" On April 29, 1995, Shakur married his girlfriend Keisha Morris, a pre-law student. Their marriage was annulled ten months later. Shakur had friendships with other celebrities, including Mike Tyson Chuck D, Jim Carrey, and Alanis Morissette. In April 1996, Shakur said that he, Morissette, Snoop Dogg, and Suge Knight were planning to open a restaurant together.\nLegal issues.\n1993 shooting in Atlanta.\nOn October 31, 1993, Shakur was arrested in Atlanta for shooting two off-duty police officers, brothers Mark Whitwell and Scott Whitwell. The Atlanta police claimed the shooting occurred after the brothers were almost struck by a car carrying Shakur while they were crossing the street with their wives. As they argued with the driver, Shakur's car pulled up and he shot the Whitwells in the buttocks and the abdomen. However, there are conflicting accounts that the Whitwells were harassing a black motorist and uttered racial slurs. According to some witnesses, Shakur and his entourage had fired in self-defense as Mark Whitwell shot at them first.\nShakur was charged with two counts of aggravated assault. Mark Whitwell was charged with firing at Shakur's car and later with making false statements to investigators. Scott Whitwell admitted to possessing a gun he had taken from a Henry County police evidence room. Prosecutors ultimately dropped all charges against both parties. Mark Whitwell resigned from the force seven months after the shooting. Both brothers filed civil suits against Shakur; Mark Whitwell's suit was settled out of court, while Scott Whitwell's $2\u00a0million lawsuit resulted in a default judgment entered against the rapper's estate in 1998.\nSexual assault case, prison sentence, appeal and release.\nIn November 1993, Shakur and two other men were charged in New York with sodomizing a woman in Shakur's hotel room. The woman, Ayanna Jackson, alleged that after she performed oral sex on Shakur at the public dance floor of a Manhattan nightclub, she went to his hotel room on a later day, when Shakur, record executive Jacques \"Haitian Jack\" Agnant, Shakur's road manager Charles Fuller and an unidentified fourth man apprehended and forced her to perform non-consensual oral sex on each of them. Shakur was also charged with illegal possession of a firearm as two guns were found in the hotel room. Interviewed on \"The Arsenio Hall Show\", Shakur said he was hurt that \"a woman would accuse me of taking something from her\", as he had been raised in a female household and surrounded by women his whole life.\nOn December 1, 1994, Shakur was acquitted of three counts of sodomy and the associated gun charges, but convicted of two counts of first-degree sexual abuse for \"forcibly touching the woman's buttocks\" in his hotel room. Jurors have said the lack of evidence stymied a sodomy conviction. Shakur's lawyer characterized the sentence as \"out of line\" with the groping conviction and the setting of bail at $3\u00a0million as \"inhumane\". Shakur's accuser later filed a civil suit against Shakur seeking $10\u00a0million for punitive damages which was subsequently settled.\nAfter Shakur had been convicted of sexual abuse, Jacques Agnant's case was separated and closed via misdemeanor plea without incarceration. A.\u00a0J. Benza reported in \"New York Daily News\" Shakur's new disdain for Agnant who Shakur theorized had set him up with the case. Shakur reportedly believed his accuser was connected to and had sexual relations with Agnant and James \"Henchman\" Rosemond, who he considered to be behind the 1994 Quad Studios shooting.\nShakur was unable to post the $3 million bond to keep himself free until sentencing so he surrendered himself to authorities at the Bellevue Hospital Jail Ward in New York City on December 23, 1994. At the time, he was still recovering from injuries he received on November 30, when he was shot five times and robbed at Quad Studios. In January 1995, Shakur was moved to the North Infirmary Command (NIC) on Rikers Island in the Bronx. On February 7, 1995, he was sentenced to 18 months to &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;4+1\u20442 years in prison by a judge who decried \"an act of brutal violence against a helpless woman\".\nIn March 1995, Shakur was transferred to Clinton Correctional Facility in Dannemora. While imprisoned, he began reading again, which he had been unable to do as his career progressed due to his marijuana and alcohol habits. Works such as \"The Prince\" by Italian philosopher Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli and \"The Art of War\" by Chinese military strategist Sun Tzu sparked Shakur's interest in philosophy, philosophy of war and military strategy. On April 29, 1995, Shakur married his girlfriend Keisha Morris; the marriage was later annulled. While in prison, Shakur exchanged letters with celebrities such as Jim Carrey and Tony Danza among others. He was also visited by Al Sharpton, who helped Shakur get released from solitary confinement. \nBy October 1995, pending judicial appeal, Shakur was incarcerated in New York. On October 12, he bonded out of the maximum security Dannemora Clinton Correctional Facility in the process of appealing his conviction, once Suge Knight, CEO of Death Row Records, arranged for the posting of his $1.4\u00a0million bond.\n1994 Quad Studios shooting.\nOn November 30, 1994, while in New York recording verses for a mixtape of Ron G, Shakur was repeatedly distracted by his beeper. Music manager James \"Jimmy Henchman\" Rosemond reportedly offered Shakur $7,000 to stop by Quad Studios, in Times Square, that night to record a verse for his client Little Shawn. Shakur was unsure, but agreed to the session as he needed the cash to offset legal costs. He arrived with Stretch and one or two others. In the lobby, three men robbed and beat him at gunpoint; Shakur resisted and was shot. Shakur speculated that the shooting had been a set-up.\nAgainst medical advice, Shakur checked out of Metropolitan Hospital Center a few hours after surgery and secretly went to the house of the actress Jasmine Guy to recuperate. The next day, Shakur arrived at a Manhattan courthouse bandaged in a wheelchair to receive the jury's verdict for his sexual abuse case. Shakur spent the next few weeks being cared for by his mother and a private doctor at Guy's home. The Fruit of Islam and former members of the Black Panther Party stood guard to protect him.\nSetup accusations involving the Notorious B.I.G..\nIn a 1995 interview with \"Vibe\", Shakur accused Sean Combs, Jimmy Henchman, and the Notorious B.I.G. \u2013 who were at Quad Studios at the time \u2013 among others, of setting up or being privy to the November 1994 robbery and shooting. The accusations were significant to the East\u2013West Coast rivalry in hip-hop; in 1995, months after the robbery, Combs and B.I.G. released the track \"Who Shot Ya?\", which Shakur took as a mockery of his shooting and thought they could be responsible, so he released a diss song, \"Hit 'Em Up\", in which he targeted B.I.G., Combs, their record label, Junior M.A.F.I.A., and at the end of \"Hit 'Em Up\", he mentions rivals Mobb Deep and Chino XL.\nIn March 2008, Chuck Philips, in the \"Los Angeles Times\", reported on the 1994 ambush and shooting. The newspaper later retracted the article since it relied partially on FBI documents later discovered forged, supplied by a man convicted of fraud. In June 2011, convicted murderer Dexter Isaac, incarcerated in Brooklyn, issued a confession that he had been one of the gunmen who had robbed and shot Shakur at Henchman's order.\nOther criminal or civil cases.\n1991 Oakland Police Department lawsuit.\nOn October 17, 1991, two Oakland Police Department officers stopped Shakur for jaywalking at a downtown intersection. According to Shakur, officers Alex Boyovic and Kevin Rogers asked him for his ID and pressed him about his name before choking him, throwing him to the ground and slamming his head on the concrete. Shakur filed a $10\u00a0million lawsuit against the officers for police brutality. The case was settled for about $43,000. It was later revealed that this incident was the onset of Shakur's autoimmune disease alopecia, which led him to shave his head bald.\nMisdemeanor assault convictions.\nOn April 5, 1993, charged with felonious assault, Shakur allegedly threw a microphone and swung a baseball bat at rapper Chauncey Wynn, of the group M.A.D., at a concert at Michigan State University. Shakur claimed the bat was a part of his show, that he never swung it, and that there was no criminal intent. Nonetheless, on September 14, 1994, Shakur pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor and was sentenced to 30 days in jail, twenty of them suspended on condition that he complete 35 hours of community service.\nSlated to star as Sharif in the 1993 Hughes Brothers' film \"Menace II Society\", Shakur was replaced by actor Vonte Sweet after allegedly assaulting one of the film's directors, Allen Hughes. In early 1994, Shakur served 15 days in jail after being found guilty of the assault. The prosecution's evidence included a \"Yo! MTV Raps\" interview in which Shakur boasted that he had \"beat up the director of \"Menace II Society\"\".\nConcealed weapon case.\nIn 1994, Shakur was arrested in Los Angeles, when he was stopped by police on suspicion of speeding. Police found a semiautomatic pistol in the car, a felony offense because a prior conviction in 1993 in Los Angeles for carrying a concealed firearm. On April 4, 1996, Shakur was sentenced to 120 days in jail for violating his release terms and failing to appear for a road cleanup job, but was allowed to remain free awaiting appeal. On June 7, his sentence was deferred via appeals pending in other cases.\n1995 wrongful death suit.\nOn August 22, 1992, in Marin City, Shakur performed outdoors at a festival. For about an hour after the performance, he signed autographs and posed for photos. A conflict broke out and Shakur allegedly drew a legally carried Colt Mustang but dropped it on the ground. Shakur claimed that someone with him then picked it up when it accidentally discharged.\nAbout 100 yards (90 meters) away in a schoolyard, Qa'id Walker-Teal, a boy aged 6 on his bicycle, was fatally shot in the forehead. Police matched the bullet to a .38-caliber pistol registered to Shakur. His stepbrother Maurice Harding was arrested in suspicion of having fired the gun, but no charges were filed. Lack of witnesses stymied prosecution. In 1995, Qa'id's mother filed a wrongful death suit against Shakur, which was settled for about $300,000 to $500,000.\nC. Delores Tucker lawsuit.\nCivil rights activist and fierce rap critic C. Delores Tucker sued Shakur's estate in federal court, claiming that lyrics in \"How Do U Want It\" and \"Wonda Why They Call U Bitch\" inflicted emotional distress, were slanderous, and invaded her privacy. The case was later dismissed.\nMurder and aftermath.\nOn the night of September 7, 1996, Shakur was in Paradise, Nevada, to attend the Bruce Seldon vs. Mike Tyson boxing match with Suge Knight at the MGM Grand. Afterward in the lobby one of Knight's associates spotted Orlando Anderson, a South Side Compton Crip, and told Shakur he had tried to rob them earlier that year. The hotel's surveillance footage shows the ensuing assault on Anderson. Shakur soon stopped by his hotel room and then headed with Knight to his Death Row nightclub, Club 662, in a black BMW 750iL sedan, part of a larger convoy.\nAt about 11\u00a0p.m. on Las Vegas Boulevard, bicycle-mounted police stopped the car for its loud music and lack of license plates. The plates were found in the trunk, and the car was released without a ticket. At about 11:15\u00a0p.m. at a stop light, a white, four-door, late-model Cadillac sedan pulled up to the passenger side and an occupant rapidly fired into the car. Shakur was struck four times: once in the arm, once in the thigh, and twice in the chest with one bullet entering his right lung. Shards hit Knight's head. Frank Alexander, Shakur's bodyguard, was not in the car at the time. He would say he had been tasked to drive the car of Shakur's girlfriend, Kidada Jones.\nShakur was taken to the University Medical Center of Southern Nevada where he was heavily sedated and put on life support. In the intensive-care unit on the afternoon of September 13, 1996, Shakur died from internal bleeding. He was pronounced dead at 4:03\u00a0p.m. The official causes of death are respiratory failure and cardiopulmonary arrest associated with multiple gunshot wounds. Shakur's body was cremated the next day. Members of the Outlawz, recalling a line in his song \"Black Jesus\", (although uncertain of the artist's attempt at a literal meaning chose to interpret the request seriously) smoked some of his body's ashes after mixing them with marijuana.\nIn 2002, investigative journalist Chuck Philips, after a year of work, reported in the \"Los Angeles Times\" that Anderson, a Southside Compton Crip, having been attacked by Suge and Shakur's entourage at the MGM Hotel after the boxing match, had fired the fatal gunshots, but that Las Vegas Metropolitan Police had interviewed him only once, briefly, before his death in an unrelated shooting. Philips's 2002 article also alleges the involvement of Christopher \"Notorious B.I.G.\" Wallace and several within New York City's criminal underworld. Both Anderson and Wallace denied involvement, while Wallace offered a confirmed alibi. Music journalist John Leland, in \"The New York Times\", called the evidence \"inconclusive\".\nIn 2011, via the Freedom of Information Act, the FBI released documents related to its investigation which described an extortion scheme by the Jewish Defense League (classified as \"a right wing terrorist group\" by the FBI) that included making death threats against Shakur and other rappers, but did not indicate a direct connection to his murder.\nOn July 18, 2023, the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department executed a search warrant in connection with Shakur's murder. On September 29, 2023, the AP reported that Las Vegas Metropolitan Police had arrested a suspect, Duane \"Keefe D\" Davis, in Shakur's murder. Police had two months previously served a search warrant at his wife's home in the Las Vegas suburb of Henderson. Davis pleaded not guilty on November 2, 2023, in Las Vegas. As of February 2025, Davis' trial is set to start on February 9, 2026. As of January 2025, Davis remains in prison. On September 3, 2025, Davis was ordered to also serve a 16 to 40 month prison sentence for a separate jailhouse fight-related conviction he received in April 2025.\nArtistry.\nMusical style.\nShakur's music and philosophical outlook were deeply influenced by a wide range of American, African American, and global influences, including the Black Panther Party, black nationalism, egalitarianism, and the concept of liberty. Moreover, Shakur's artistic sensibilities were enriched by his passion for theater and admiration for the works of William Shakespeare. Notably, he honed his theatrical skills as a student at the Baltimore School for the Arts, where he delved into the psychological complexities inherent in inter-gang warfare and inter-cultural conflicts, reflecting themes explored in Shakespearean dramas.\n\"2Pacalypse Now\" (1991), showcased his socially conscious perspective. Through powerful tracks like \"Brenda's Got a Baby\", \"Trapped\", and \"Part Time Mutha\", Shakur addressed social injustice, poverty, and police brutality. In doing so, he contributed to the ongoing success of rap groups such as Boogie Down Productions, Public Enemy, X-Clan, and Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five, while establishing himself as one of the pioneering socially conscious rappers from the West Coast.\nContinuing his focus on the social challenges faced by African American people, Shakur's second album featured songs like \"The Streetz R Deathrow\" and \"Last Wordz\". Simultaneously, he showcased his compassionate side with the empowering anthem \"Keep Ya Head Up\", and his legendary intensity with the title track from the album \"Strictly 4 My N.I.G.G.A.Z...\" Additionally, he paid homage to his former group Digital Underground by including them on the playful track \"I Get Around\". Throughout his career, Shakur's subsequent albums reflected a growing assertiveness in his approach.\nShakur's body of work encompassed contrasting themes, including social inequality, injustice, compassion, playfulness, and hope. These elements continued to shape his artistry, exemplified by his explosive 1995 album \"Me Against the World\". The release of \"All Eyez on Me\" in 1996 further solidified his reputation, with tracks like \"Ambitionz az a Ridah\", \"I Ain't Mad at Cha\", \"California Love\", \"Life Goes On\", and \"Picture Me Rollin'\" being hailed as classics by critics. Shakur described \"All Eyez on Me\" as a celebration of life, and the album achieved both critical acclaim and commercial success. According to Eminem, Tupac is the greatest songwriter of all time. Nas said in 2002: \"I put Tupac beyond Shakespeare.\"\nVocal style.\nSingers can manipulate different parts of their body to create various sounds. For instance, the \"head voice\" involves singing high-pitched tones resonating from the head, while the \"chest voice\" utilizes the chest area. In the documentary \"Tupac Shakur: Thug Angel\", Greg \"Shock G\" Jacobs, one of Shakur's early producers, discusses how rappers also utilize different bodily areas to project their voices. According to him, \"Slick Rick rhymed from the nasal palate, Nas from the back of his throat, and Pac from the pit of his stomach, which is where his power came from.\" Shakur's influences stemmed from powerful orators like Martin Luther King Jr. and Malcolm X. Despite not being physically imposing, Shakur's voice carried immense weight and power, reminiscent of these influential speakers.\nShakur was also known for his technique of stacking or layering vocals, adding depth and rawness to his voice. This approach, demonstrated notably on tracks like \"Dear Mama\" from his 1995 album \"Me Against the World\", involves overlaying multiple vocal lines to highlight rhythms and emphasize words and phrases. Mastering this technique requires precision to maintain flow and clarity, as heard in the lyrics \"and even though I act crazy/I gotta thank the Lord that you made me\", where Shakur's voice transitions from full to husky, underscoring the emotional depth of the lyrics. Despite its difficulty, Shakur's background in jazz, poetry, and theater endowed him with exceptional rhythm control, enabling him to layer vocals seamlessly while preserving cohesion and flow.\nLegacy and remembrance.\nShakur is considered one of the greatest and most influential rappers of all time. He was listed as one of the greatest artists of all time by \"Rolling Stone\". He is widely credited as an important figure in hip-hop culture, and his prominence in pop culture in general has been noted. Dotdash, formerly About.com, while ranking him fifth among the greatest rappers, nonetheless notes, \"Tupac Shakur is the most influential hip-hop artist of all time. Even in death, 2Pac remains a transcendental rap figure.\" Yet to some, he was a \"father figure\" who, said rapper YG, \"makes you want to be better\u2014at every level.\" In 2023, Billboard ranked Tupac at number 4 among the top 50 rappers of all time.\nAllMusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine described Shakur as \"the unlikely martyr of gangsta rap\", with Shakur paying the ultimate price of a criminal lifestyle. Shakur was described as one of the top two American rappers in the 1990s, along with Snoop Dogg. The online rap magazine \"AllHipHop\" held a 2007 roundtable at which New York rappers Cormega, citing tour experience with New York rap duo Mobb Deep, commented that B.I.G. ran New York, but Shakur ran America. Shakur emerged as a celebrated artist, earning recognition for his astonishingly prolific output and unwavering commitment to his craft. According to Rolling Stone writer Andy Green: \"He was also a poet and activist who became one of his era's most revolutionary voices.\"\nIn 2017, American rapper Snoop Dogg called Tupac \"the greatest rapper of all time\" during his Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame tribute. In 2021, Saweetie told Complex that Tupac was \"the greatest rapper that ever lived\".\nAccording to British writer Rob Marriott, he deemed the act of tying a bandana into rabbit ears as one of the most distinctive and instantly recognizable style choices in the world of hip-hop. Regarded as a sex symbol, his unique style helped shape the fashion landscape of the 1990s and continues to influence artists and fashion enthusiasts to this day.\nIn 2010, writing \"Rolling Stone\" magazine's entry on Shakur at No. 86 among the \"100 greatest artists\", New York rapper 50 Cent appraised:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Every rapper who grew up in the Nineties owes something to Tupac. People either try to emulate him in some way, or they go in a different direction because they didn't like what he did. But whatever you think of him, he definitely developed his own style: He didn't sound like anyone who came before him.\nAccording to music journalist Chuck Philips, Shakur \"had helped elevate rap from a crude street fad to a complex art form, setting the stage for the current global hip-hop phenomenon.\" Philips writes, \"The slaying silenced one of modern music's most eloquent voices\u2014a ghetto poet whose tales of urban alienation captivated young people of all races and backgrounds.\" Via numerous fans perceiving him, despite his questionable conduct, as a martyr, \"the downsizing of martyrdom cheapens its use\", academic Michael Eric Dyson concedes. But Dyson adds, \"Some, or even most, of that criticism can be conceded without doing damage to Tupac's martyrdom in the eyes of those disappointed by more traditional martyrs.\"\nIn 2014, BET explained that \"his confounding mixture of ladies' man, thug, revolutionary and poet has forever altered our perception of what a rapper should look like, sound like and act like. In 50 Cent, Ja Rule, Lil Wayne, newcomers like Freddie Gibbs and even his friend-turned-rival B.I.G., it's easy to see that Pac is the most copied MC of all time. There are murals bearing his likeness in New York, Brazil, Sierra Leone, Bulgaria and countless other places; he even has statues in Atlanta and Germany. Quite simply, no other rapper has captured the world's attention the way Tupac did and still does.\" More simply, his writings, published after his death, inspired rapper YG to return to school and get his GED. In 2020, former California Senator and former vice-president Kamala Harris called Shakur the \"best rapper alive\", which she explained as being because \"West Coast girls think 2Pac lives on\". According to writer Kevin Powell: \"He deserves to be put in the same category as Bob Dylan, Bob Marley, as John Lennon, in terms of his global impact.\" Tupac is regarded as one of the most influential artists in music and popular culture in general and an icon of activism.\nPalestinian rapper Tamer Nafar, leader and a founding member of DAM, became passionate about hip-hop by listening to Tupac, saying, \"The imagery in Shakur's videos was similar to our reality in Lod.\"\nFinal resting place in Soweto.\nIn 2006, on the 10th anniversary of Tupac Shakur's passing, his ashes were laid to rest in Soweto. Shakur's mother Afeni transported them to the \"birthplace of his ancestors\" and conducted a memorial service in what's considered as one of the most renowned South African townships. Afeni Shakur explained that Soweto had been selected due to its significance as the \"birthplace of the South African struggle for democracy and against apartheid.\" The City of Johannesburg Metropolitan Municipality donated a five-acre plot of undeveloped land in the Zola area of Soweto to build a memorial honoring Shakur. A portion of the land was designated to be transformed into a park for the benefit of local children as well as aimed at promoting environmental education, pathways, orphanages, bridges, skateboard ramps and a golf range while plans also included the construction of an amphitheater and a museum showcasing South African music and arts. The project was funded by Johannesburg city authorities and the Tupac Amaru Shakur Foundation. The memorial was hosted by South African musician and actor Zola 7. Singer Macy Gray and members of the Outlawz were amongst the attendees who paid their respects.\nTupac Amaru Shakur Foundation.\nIn 1997, Shakur's mother founded the Shakur Family Foundation. Later renamed the Tupac Amaru Shakur Foundation, or TASF, it launched with a stated mission to \"provide training and support for students who aspire to enhance their creative talents.\" The TASF sponsors essay contests, charity events, a performing arts day camp for teenagers, and undergraduate scholarships. In June 2005, the TASF opened the Tupac Amaru Shakur Center for the Arts, or TASCA, in Stone Mountain, Georgia. It closed in 2015.\nAcademic appraisal.\nIn 1997, the University of California, Berkeley, offered a course led by a student titled \"History 98: Poetry and History of Tupac Shakur\". In April 2003, Harvard University cosponsored the symposium \"All Eyez on Me: Tupac Shakur and the Search for the Modern Folk Hero\", where Shakur's influence as both an artist and an activist was analyzed.\nThe papers presented cover his ranging influence from entertainment to sociology. Calling him a \"Thug Nigga Intellectual\", an \"organic intellectual\", English scholar Mark Anthony Neal assessed his death as leaving a \"leadership void amongst hip-hop artists\", as this \"walking contradiction\" helps, Neal explained, \"make being an intellectual accessible to ordinary people.\"\nTracing Shakur's mythical status, Murray Forman discussed him as \"O.G.\", or \"Ostensibly Gone\", with fans, using digital mediums, \"resurrecting Tupac as an ethereal life force.\" Music scholar Emmett Price, calling him a \"Black folk hero\", traced his persona to Black American folklore's tricksters, which, after abolition, evolved into the urban \"bad-man\". Yet in Shakur's \"terrible sense of urgency\", Price identified instead a quest to \"unify mind, body, and spirit.\" According to Price, Tupac had surpassed the legacies of John Coltrane and Mahalia Jackson within the tradition of black music.\nIn 2012, the Norwegian University of Oslo organized the course: \"Tupac, hiphop og kulturhistorie (Tupac, hip-hop and cultural history).\" As Knut Aukrust, Norwegian professor and academic scholar of cultural studies at the University of Oslo, puts it: \"Tupac Amaru Shakur (1971\u20131996) is one of the most famous and controversial representatives of hip-hop culture. He has become an icon with saint status far beyond his fans. References to him and his message appear all over the world, from Barack Obama's slogan about \"changes\", to Palestinians and Israelis longing for peace in the Middle East, to the people of Groruddalen who want their experiences to be taken on board serious. The course highlights how a single person can fit into a wider network of cultural models and how a local storytelling tradition has become an international cultural phenomenon.\"\nJeffrey Ogbonna Green Ogbar, professor of History and Popular Music at the University of Connecticut, described Shakur as \"one of the most iconic and influential music artists of the 20th century\", and also a \"politically conscious activist voice for Black America.\"\nMultimedia releases.\nIn 2005, Death Row released on DVD, \"\", his final recorded live performance, an event on July 4, 1996. In August 2006, \"Tupac Shakur Legacy\", an \"interactive biography\" by Jamal Joseph, arrived with previously unpublished family photographs, intimate stories, and over 20 detachable copies of his handwritten song lyrics, contracts, scripts, poetry, and other papers. In 2006, the Shakur album \"Pac's Life\" was released and, like the previous, was among the recording industry's most popular releases. In 2008, his estate made about $15\u00a0million.\nOn April 15, 2012, at the Coachella Music Festival, rappers Snoop Dogg and Dr. Dre joined a Shakur \"hologram\" (Although the media referred to the technology as a hologram, technically it was a projection created with the Musion Eyeliner), and, as a partly virtual trio, performed the Shakur songs \"Hail Mary\" and \"2 of Amerikaz Most Wanted\". There were talks of a tour, but Dre refused. Meanwhile, the \"Greatest Hits\" album, released in 1998, and which in 2000 had left the pop albums chart, the Billboard 200, returned to the chart and reached No. 129, while also other Shakur albums and singles drew sales gains.\nFilm and stage.\nThe documentary film \"\" was released in November 2003. It was nominated for Best Documentary at the 2005 Academy Awards.\nIn 2014, the play \"Holler If Ya Hear Me\", based on Shakur's lyrics, played on Broadway, but, among Broadway's worst-selling musicals in recent years, ran only six weeks. In development since 2013, a Shakur biopic, \"All Eyez on Me\", began filming in Atlanta in December 2015. It was released on June 16, 2017, on Shakur's 46th birthday, albeit to generally negative reviews.\nIn August 2019, a docuseries directed by Allen Hughes, \"Outlaw: The Saga of Afeni and Tupac Shakur\", was announced.\nFilmography.\nDocumentaries.\nShakur's life has been explored in several documentaries, most notably the Academy Award-nominated \"Tupac: Resurrection\" (2003).\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "31342", "revid": "50076165", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31342", "title": "The Picture of Dorian Gray", "text": "1890 novel by Oscar Wilde\nThe Picture of Dorian Gray is an 1890 philosophical fiction and Gothic horror novel by Irish writer Oscar Wilde. A shorter novella-length version was published in the July 1890 issue of the American periodical \"Lippincott's Monthly Magazine\", while the novel-length version was published in April 1891. Wilde's only novel, it is widely regarded as a classic of both Gothic and English literature, having been adapted many times for films, stage, plays, and other forms of art performances, in addition to inspiring the Dorian Awards since 2009.\nThe work was originally commissioned by J. M. Stoddart, the managing editor of \"Lippincott's Monthly Magazine\", as a novella in 1889, but after facing public backlash for its perceived immorality, Wilde revised the story. He added a new preface which outlined his aesthetic philosophy and also expanded the initial narrative with six additional chapters. It was this expanded version which eventually became the novel. Critics have also noted that an earlier story written by Wilde, titled \"The Portrait of Mr. W. H.\" and published in 1889, has several of the themes and styles seen in this novel. The story itself originated from a conversation Wilde had with his friend, artist Basil Ward, who was an early version of the character Basil Hallward. \nThe story revolves around a portrait of Dorian Gray painted by Basil Hallward, a friend of Dorian's and an artist infatuated with Dorian's beauty. Through Basil, Dorian meets Lord Henry Wotton and is soon enthralled by the aristocrat's hedonistic worldview: that beauty and sensual fulfilment are the only things worth pursuing in life. Knowing that he will lose his beauty with time, Dorian impulsively chooses to sell his soul and asks for the portrait, rather than himself, to age and fade. His wish granted, Dorian pursues a libertine life of varied immoral experiences while staying young and beautiful; all the while, his portrait ages and visually records every one of Dorian's sins. Wilde used several aphorisms to explain the role of the artist in society, the purpose and utility of artistic representations, and the value of beauty. He also uses the themes of morality and influence to explore various societal values and ethics, individual relationships and personal choices, and their role in shaping an individual's moral compass. \nThe novel was initially subjected to much controversy and criticism in its time even after its revisions, with publishers sometimes withdrawing it from public circulation. Since the 20th century, however, there has been a surge in interest and it is now recognised as one of Wilde's best-known publications. It remains an important work as the novel is a direct commentary on the aesthetic movement of the 19th century, and is regarded as a centerpiece of the movement, which emphasised beauty and art for art's sake.\nOrigins.\nIn 1882, Oscar Wilde met Frances Richards in Ottawa, where he visited her studios. In 1887, Richards moved to London where she renewed her acquaintance with Wilde and painted his portrait. Wilde described that incident as being the inspiration for the novel:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;In December, 1887, I gave a sitting to a Canadian artist who was staying with some friends of hers and mine in South Kensington. When the sitting was over, and I had looked at the portrait, I said in jest, 'What a tragic thing it is. This portrait will never grow older and I shall. If it was only the other way!' The moment I had said this it occurred to me what a capital plot the idea would make for a story. The result is 'Dorian Gray.'\nIn 1889, J. M. Stoddart, an editor for \"Lippincott's Monthly Magazine\", was in London to solicit novellas to publish in the magazine. On 30 August 1889, Stoddart dined with Oscar Wilde, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle and T. P. Gill at the Langham Hotel, and commissioned novellas from each writer. Doyle promptly submitted \"The Sign of the Four\", which was published in the February 1890 edition of \"Lippincott's\". Stoddart received Wilde's manuscript for \"The Picture of Dorian Gray\" on 7 April 1890, seven months after having commissioned the novel from him.\nIn July 1889, Wilde published \"The Portrait of Mr. W. H.\", a very different story but one that has a similar title to \"The Picture of Dorian Gray\" and has been described as \"a preliminary sketch of some of its major themes\", including homosexuality.\nPublication and versions.\n1890 novella.\nThe literary merits of \"The Picture of Dorian Gray\" impressed Stoddart, but he told the publisher, George Lippincott, \"in its present condition there are a number of things an innocent woman would make an exception to.\" Fearing that the story was indecent, Stoddart deleted around five hundred words without Wilde's knowledge prior to publication. Among the pre-publication deletions were: (i) passages alluding to homosexuality and to homosexual desire; (ii) all references to the fictional book title \"Le Secret de Raoul\" and its author, Catulle Sarrazin; and (iii) all \"mistress\" references to Gray's lovers, Sibyl Vane and Hetty Merton.\nIt was published in full as the first 100 pages in both the American and British editions of the July 1890 issue, first printed on 20 June 1890. Later in the year the publisher of Lippincott's Monthly Magazine, Ward, Lock and Company, published a collection of complete novels from the magazine, which included Wilde's.\n1891 novel.\nFor the fuller 1891 novel, Wilde retained Stoddart's edits and made some of his own, expanding the text from thirteen to twenty chapters and adding the book's famous preface. Chapters 3, 5, and 15\u201318 are new, and chapter 13 of the magazine edition was divided into chapters 19 and 20 for the novel. Revisions include changes in character dialogue as well as the addition of the preface, more scenes and chapters, and Sibyl Vane's brother, James Vane.\nThe edits have been construed as having been done in response to criticism, but Wilde denied this in his 1895 trials, only ceding that critic Walter Pater, whom Wilde respected, did write several letters to him \"and in consequence of what he said I did modify one passage\" that was \"liable to misconstruction\". A number of edits involved obscuring homoerotic references, to simplify the moral message of the story. In the magazine edition (1890), Basil tells Lord Henry how he \"worships\" Dorian, and begs him not to \"take away the one person that makes my life absolutely lovely to me.\" In the magazine edition, Basil focuses upon love, whereas, in the book edition (1891), he focuses upon his art, saying to Lord Henry, \"the one person who gives my art whatever charm it may possess: my life as an artist depends on him.\"\nWilde's textual additions were about the \"fleshing out of Dorian as a character\" and providing details of his ancestry that made his \"psychological collapse more prolonged and more convincing.\" The introduction of the James Vane character to the story develops the socio-economic background of the Sibyl Vane character, thus emphasising Dorian's selfishness and foreshadowing James's accurate perception of the essentially immoral character of Dorian Gray; thus, he correctly deduced Dorian's dishonourable intent towards Sibyl. The sub-plot about James Vane's dislike of Dorian gives the novel a Victorian tinge of class struggle.\nIn April 1891 Ward, Lock and Company published the revised version of \"The Picture of Dorian Gray\". In the decade after Wilde's death, the authorised edition of the novel was published by Charles Carrington.\n2011 \"uncensored\" novella.\nThe original typescript submitted to \"Lippincott's Monthly Magazine\", now housed at UCLA, had been largely forgotten except by professional Wilde scholars until the 2011 publication of \"The Picture of Dorian Gray: An Annotated, Uncensored Edition\" by the Belknap Press. This edition includes the roughly 500 words of text deleted by J. M. Stoddart, the story's initial editor, prior to its publication in \"Lippincott's\" in 1890. For instance, in one scene, Basil Hallward confesses that he has worshipped Dorian Gray with a \"romance of feeling\", and has never loved a woman.\nPreface.\nFollowing the criticism of the magazine edition of the novel, Wilde wrote a preface in which he indirectly addressed the criticisms in a series of epigrams. The preface was first published in \"The Fortnightly Review\" and then, a month later, in the book version of the novel. The content, style, and presentation of the preface made it famous in its own right as a literary and artistic manifesto in support of artists' rights and art for art's sake.\nTo communicate how the novel should be read, Wilde used aphorisms to explain the role of the artist in society, the purpose of art, and the value of beauty. It traces Wilde's cultural exposure to Taoism and to the philosophy of Chuang Ts\u01d4 (Zhuang Zhou). Before writing the preface, Wilde had written a book review of Herbert Giles's translation of the work of Zhuang Zhou, and in the essay \"The Critic as Artist\", Oscar Wilde said:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The honest ratepayer and his healthy family have no doubt often mocked at the dome-like forehead of the philosopher, and laughed over the strange perspective of the landscape that lies beneath him. If they really knew who he was, they would tremble. For Chuang Ts\u01d4 spent his life in preaching the great creed of Inaction, and in pointing out the uselessness of all things.\nSummary.\nIn Victorian England, Lord Henry Wotton observes his friend, artist Basil Hallward, painting the portrait of Dorian Gray, a wealthy young man who is Basil's ultimate muse. The hedonistic Lord Henry thinks that beauty is the only aspect of life worth pursuing, prompting Dorian to wish that his portrait would age instead of himself.\nUnder Lord Henry's influence, Dorian fully explores his sensuality, leading to both men neglecting their friendship with Basil. Dorian discovers the actress Sibyl Vane, who performs Shakespeare plays in a dingy, working-class theatre. Admiring her talent, Dorian courts her and soon proposes marriage. The enamoured Sibyl calls him \"Prince Charming\". Her younger brother, James, leaves for a job at sea, but warns Sibyl that if \"Prince Charming\" harms her, he will murder him.\nDorian invites Basil and Lord Henry to see Sibyl perform in a play. Sibyl, too enamoured with Dorian to act, performs poorly, which makes Basil and Lord Henry think Dorian has fallen in love with Sibyl because of her beauty instead of her talent. Embarrassed, Dorian rejects Sibyl, saying that acting is her beauty; without that, she no longer interests him. Returning home, Dorian notices that the portrait has changed; his wish came true, and the man in the portrait bears a subtle sneer of cruelty.\nConscience-stricken and lonely, Dorian decides to reconcile with Sibyl, writing a letter. However, in the morning, Lord Henry arrives and informs Dorian she has killed herself. Rationalizing his cruelty, the young man decides that he has no need for love since his immortality protects him from any consequence. Dorian locks the portrait up, and for eighteen years, he experiments with every vice, influenced by a morally poisonous French novel that Lord Henry gave him.\nOne night, before leaving for Paris, Basil goes to Dorian's house to ask him about rumours of his self-indulgent sensualism. Dorian does not deny his debauchery and takes Basil to see the portrait. The portrait has become so hideous that Basil can only identify it as his by the signature on it. Horrified, Basil beseeches Dorian to pray for salvation; angered by Basil's reaction, Dorian stabs him to death. Dorian then blackmails an old friend, scientist Alan Campbell, into using his knowledge of chemistry to destroy Basil's body. Alan later kills himself.\nTo escape the guilt of his crime, Dorian goes to an opium den, where, unbeknownst to him, an older James Vane is present. James has been seeking vengeance upon Dorian ever since Sibyl's death but had no leads to pursue as the only thing he knew about Dorian was the nickname she called him. There, however, he hears someone refer to Dorian as \"Prince Charming\". James accosts Dorian, who deceives him into believing he is too young to have known Sibyl, as his face is still that of a young man. James relents and releases Dorian but is then approached by a woman from the den who reproaches James for not killing Dorian. She confirms Dorian's identity and explains that he has not aged in eighteen years.\nJames begins to stalk Dorian, who starts to fear for his life. During a shooting party, a hunter accidentally kills James, who was lurking in a thicket. On returning to London, Dorian tells the elderly Lord Henry that he will live righteously from now on. His new probity begins with deliberately not breaking the heart of Hetty Merton, his current romantic interest. Dorian wonders if his newly found goodness has rescinded the corruption in the picture but when he looks at it, he sees an even uglier image of himself. From that, Dorian understands that he can never be truly redeemed as he only wishes to be absolved of his sins, without truly believing that what he has done is wrong.\nDeciding that only a full confession will suffice, Dorian finds the knife with which he murdered Basil and stabs the picture in a bout of fury.\nHis servants awaken on hearing a cry from the locked room; on the street, a passerby who also heard it calls the police. On entering the locked room, the servants find an old man stabbed in the heart, his figure withered and decrepit. They identify the corpse as Dorian only by the rings on the fingers, while the portrait beside him is beautiful again.\nMajor themes.\nMorality and societal influence.\nThroughout the novel, Wilde delves into the themes of morality and influence, exploring how societal values, individual relationships, and personal choices intersect to shape one's own moral compass. Dorian initially falls under Lord Henry's influence and \"narcissistic perspective on art and life\", despite Basil's warnings, but \"eventually recognizes its limitations\".\u00a0Through Lord Henry's dialogue, Wilde is suggesting, as professor Dominic Manganiello pointed out, that creating art enacts the innate ability to conjure criminal impulses.\u00a0Dorian's immersion in the elite social circles of Victorian London exposes him to a culture of superficiality and moral hypocrisy. Supporting this idea, Sheldon W. Liebman offered the example of Wilde's inclusion of a great psychological intellect held by Lord Henry. Before Sybil's death, Henry was also a firm believer in vanity as the origin of a human being's irrationality.\u00a0This concept is broken for Henry after Sybil is found dead, the irony being that Dorian is the cause of her death and his motives are exactly as Lord Henry has taught them to him.\nThe novel presents other relationships that influence Dorian's way of life and his perception of the world, proving the influence of society and its values on a person. While Lord Henry is clearly a persona that fascinates and captures Dorian's attention, Manganiello also suggests that Basil is also a person that may \"evoke a change of heart\" in Dorian.\u00a0However, at this point in the novel, Dorian has spent far too much time under Lord Henry's wing and brushes Basil off in \"appositeness\", leading Basil to claim that man has no soul but art does.\u00a0Dorian's journey serves as a cautionary tale about the dangers of succumbing to the temptations of hedonism and moral relativism, highlighting the importance of personal responsibility and moral accountability in navigating the complexities of human existence.\nHomoeroticism and gender roles.\nThe novel's representation of homoeroticism is subtle yet present by manifesting itself through interactions between male characters in a way that challenges the strict social norms of Victorian England.\u00a0The novel begins with a conversation between Lord Henry and Basil, where Basil reveals his artistic admiration for Dorian, setting the scene for a story with themes such as beauty, art, and the consequences of vanity. The interaction introduces the characters and foreshadows the complicated relationship between the artist and his muse.\nIt has been noted by scholars that Wilde possibly chose the protagonist's name, Dorian, in reference to the Dorians of ancient Greece, argued to have been the first to introduce male same-sex initiation rituals to ancient Greek culture, being an allusion to Greek love.\nSimilarly, gender roles influence the relationships between characters and form their expectations and behaviors; in particular, the expectations of masculinity and the critique of the Victorian ideal of manhood are seen throughout the narrative. Dorian, with his eternal youth and beauty, challenges traditional male roles and the slow decay of his portrait reflects the deception of societal expectations. Additionally, the few female characters in the story, such as Sybil, are portrayed in ways that critique the limited roles and harsh judgments reserved for women during that era. The novel's exploration of these themes provides commentary on the structures of Victorian society, revealing the performative side of gender roles that restrict and define both men and women.\nVanity and egotism.\nThrough the central framing device of the portrait and Dorian's reaction to it, scholars have hinted that Wilde touches heavily on the themes of vanity and egotism within the work, through Dorian finding a medium to investigate both themes' relevance to Victorian society. In chapter 3, Dorian's upbringing is revealed. Dorian's father \"was a junior officer in the infantry, 'a penniless fellow'... 'a mere nobody'...\" (Wilde 35). According to scholar Richard J. Walker, Dorian's upbringing makes his vanity seemingly a product of it. Walker follows this claim through by showing, in chapter 7, Dorian's high taste. Dorian describes the east as a \"Gothic creation with its 'dimly-lit streets' and 'evil-looking houses'\" inhabited by \"'[w]omen with horses voices,' drunkards that curse and chatter 'like monstrous apes', and 'grotesque children'\" (Wilde 86/Walker 92). Walker, through this passage, makes the claim that Dorian's vanity makes him see anything that he doesn't have less than desirable.\nScholars have argued Dorian's downward spiral does not start until the painter Basil Hallward is captivated by his charms. According to Aati Alaati, a scholar who delves into the themes of decadence and vanity in his own writings, \"Basil thinks that art should be unconscious, ideal, and remote, but he shows an extreme degree of self-consciousness\" (Alaati, 13). We see how prior to the book's start Hallward's influence bleeds into Dorian, an influence that becomes more prominent once Lord Henry warns Dorian about the beauty he would lose through aging. Dorian goes as far as to say that \"youth is the only thing worth having. When I find that I am growing old, I shall kill myself\" (Wilde, 28). Through the influence of Lord Henry, Basil starts to notice how Lord Henry is molding Dorian Gray to living a corrupt double life. According to Dominic Mangianello, Dorian starts to believe that \"sin no longer ravishes the beauty of the soul, as in the traditional view, but rather helps it to flourish\", therefore allowing him to validate doing whatever he pleases as long as it feels good (Manganiello 26). Due to Henry's influence, Dorian becomes a self-centered and vain person, which ultimately becomes the reason for his fall into depravity. Dorian acts on hedonism, which leads him to becoming self-destructive and corrupt. This is why his portrait rots as he sins. Sarah Kofman says in her book Enigmas that \"Dorian's soul, which has not yet lost its purity and innocence, becomes the object of desire for two men who want to attract it in opposite directions: one on whom he himself 'exercises' an influence but who has had no effect on him, the other who, by revealing the mystery of life to him, does indeed seize hold of his soul and makes devilish attempt to re-create him in his own image under the effect of his 'bad influence'\"(Kofman, 28).\nVanity is an overarching theme throughout the book. Dorian demonstrates his resentfulness towards things that would outlive his youth by saying \"I am jealous of everything whose beauty does not die. I am jealous of the portrait you have painted of me\" (Wilde, 28). In chapter 11, Dorian is under the influence of the \"yellow book\" that Lord Henry has lent him. Dorian studies beautiful objects, like jewels and music, held by those who came before him. Dorian becomes interested in various historical, philosophical figures, and Catholicism. He is interested with Catholicism for its aesthetic not for religious reasons. Dorian's arguably superficial world view leads him to value the appearance of beauty over anything else. He watches his portrait because he is becoming \"more and more enamored of his own beauty\" (chapter xi, 124).\nInfluences and allusions.\nWilde's own life.\nWilde wrote in an 1894 letter:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;[\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\"] contains much of me in it \u2013 Basil Hallward is what I think I am; Lord Henry, what the world thinks me; Dorian is what I would like to be \u2013 in other ages, perhaps.\nHallward is supposed to have been formed after painter Charles Haslewood Shannon. Scholars generally accept that Lord Henry is partly inspired by Wilde's friend Lord Ronald Gower. It was purported that Wilde's inspiration for Dorian Gray was the poet John Gray, but Gray distanced himself from the rumour. Some believe that Wilde used Robert de Montesquiou in creating \"Dorian Gray\".\n\"Faust\".\nWilde is purported to have said, \"in every first novel the hero is the author as Christ or Faust.\" In both the legend of \"Faust\" and in \"The Picture of Dorian Gray\" a temptation (ageless beauty) is placed before the protagonist, which he indulges. In each story, the protagonist entices a beautiful woman to love him, and then destroys her life. In the preface to the novel, Wilde said that the notion behind the tale is \"old in the history of literature\", but was a thematic subject to which he had \"given a new form\".\nUnlike the academic \"Faust\", the gentleman Dorian makes no deal with the Devil, who is represented by the cynical hedonist Lord Henry, who presents the temptation that will corrupt the virtue and innocence that Dorian possesses at the start of the story. Throughout, Lord Henry appears unaware of the effect of his actions upon the young man; and so frivolously advises Dorian, that \"the only way to get rid of a temptation is to yield to it. Resist it, and your soul grows sick with longing.\" As such, the devilish Lord Henry is \"leading Dorian into an unholy pact, by manipulating his innocence and insecurity.\"\nShakespeare.\nIn the preface, Wilde speaks of the sub-human Caliban character from \"The Tempest\". In chapter seven, when he goes to look for Sibyl but is instead met by her manager, he writes: \"He felt as if he had come to look for Miranda and had been met by Caliban\".\nWhen Dorian tells Lord Henry about his new love Sibyl Vane, he mentions the Shakespeare plays in which she has acted, and refers to her by the name of the heroine of each play. In the 1891 version, Dorian describes his portrait by quoting \"Hamlet\", in which the eponymous character impels his potential suitor (Ophelia) to madness and possibly suicide, and Ophelia's brother (Laertes) to swear mortal revenge.\nJoris-Karl Huysmans.\nThe anonymous \"poisonous French novel\" that leads Dorian to his fall is a thematic variant of \"\u00c0 rebours\" (1884), by Joris-Karl Huysmans. In the biography \"Oscar Wilde\" (1989), the literary critic Richard Ellmann said:\nWilde does not name the book, but at his trial he conceded that it was, or almost [was], Huysmans's \"\u00c0 rebours\" ... to a correspondent, he wrote that he had played a \"fantastic variation\" upon \"\u00c0 rebours\", and someday must write it down. The references in \"Dorian Gray\" to specific chapters are deliberately inaccurate.\nPossible Disraeli influence.\nSome commentators have suggested that \"The Picture of Dorian Gray\" was influenced by the British Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli's (anonymously published) first novel \"Vivian Grey\" (1826), as \"a kind of homage from one outsider to another\". Part way through the book, which was serialised, Disraeli, in his capacity as the anonymous author, responds to criticism by readers of parts already published of \"...the affectation, the flippancy, the arrogance, the wicked wit of this fictitious character\" by explaining that he had \"conceived of the character of a youth of great talents, whose mind had been corrupted...\". He goes on to write: \"To deem all things vain is the bitter portion of that mind, who, having known the world, dares to think.\". The name of Dorian Gray's love interest, Sibyl Vane, may be a modified fusion of the title of Disraeli's best known novel (\"Sybil\") and Vivian Grey's love interest Violet Fane, who, like Sibyl Vane, dies tragically. There is also a tale recounted within \"Vivian Grey\" in which the eyes in the portrait of a young man \"...so beautiful...you cannot imagine...\" move when its subject dies.\nReactions.\nContemporary response.\nEven after the removal of controversial text, \"The Picture of Dorian Gray\" offended the moral sensibilities of British book reviewers, to the extent, in some cases, of saying that Wilde merited prosecution for violating the laws guarding public morality.\nIn the 30 June 1890 issue of the \"Daily Chronicle\", the book critic said that Wilde's novel contains \"one element ... which will taint every young mind that comes in contact with it.\" In the 5 July 1890 issue of the \"Scots Observer\", a reviewer asked \"Why must Oscar Wilde 'go grubbing in muck-heaps?'\" The book critic of \"The Irish Times\" said, \"The Picture of Dorian Gray\" was \"first published to some scandal.\" Such book reviews achieved for the novel a \"certain notoriety for being 'mawkish and nauseous', 'unclean', 'effeminate' and 'contaminating'.\" Such moralistic scandal arose from the novel's homoeroticism, which offended the sensibilities (social, literary, and aesthetic) of Victorian book critics. Most of the criticism was, however, personal, attacking Wilde for being a hedonist with values that deviated from the conventionally accepted morality of Victorian Britain.\nIn response to such criticism, Wilde aggressively defended his novel and the sanctity of art in his correspondence with the British press. Wilde also obscured the homoeroticism of the story and expanded the personal background of the characters in the 1891 book edition.\nDue to controversy, retailing chain WHSmith, then Britain's largest bookseller, withdrew every copy of the July 1890 issue of \"Lippincott's Monthly Magazine\" from its bookstalls in railway stations.\nAt Wilde's 1895 trials, the book was called a \"perverted novel\" and passages (from the magazine version) were read during cross-examination. The book's association with Wilde's trials further hurt the book's reputation. In the decade after Wilde's death in 1900, the authorized edition of the novel was published by Charles Carrington, who specialized in literary erotica.\nModern response.\nThe novel was mostly ignored and considered \"unworthy\" of critical attention until about the 1980s; with Richard Ellmann even writing that \"parts of the novel are wooden, padded, self-indulgent\". Afterwards, critics began to reassess it as a masterpiece of Wilde's oeuvre. Joyce Carol Oates wrote of the book \"it is exceptionally good \u2013 in fact, one of the strongest and most haunting of English novels\", while noting that the reputation of the novel was still questionable. Allie Townsend of \"Time\" placed it 8th on her 6 October 2010 \"must read classic horror novels\" list, remarking \"Oscar Wilde's only novel, \"The Picture Of Dorian Gray\" is a beautifully brooding account of a man whose vanity leads him to wish for everlasting youth, and the spiraling menace of immortality.\" \"The Mary Sue\" put it on its list of \"best gothic horror novels\", stating \"Oscar Wilde's most celebrated novel, The Picture of Dorian Gray, combines Gothic elements with the author's trademark wit and social commentary. The novel revolves around Dorian Gray, a charming and erudite man whose portrait ages and warps as a result of his debauchery while he remains unblemished and youthful. Wilde explores the nature of beauty, the dangers of indulgence, and the rot that lurks under a seemingly perfect facade ... I can relate.\" In March 2014, Robert McCrum of \"The Guardian\" listed it among the 100 best novels ever written in English, calling it \"an arresting, and slightly camp, exercise in late-Victorian gothic\".\nLegacy and adaptations.\nThough not initially a widely appreciated component of Wilde's body of work following his death in 1900, \"The Picture of Dorian Gray\" has come to attract a great deal of academic and popular interest, and has been the subject of many adaptations to film and stage.\nIn 1913, it was adapted to the stage by writer G. Constant Lounsbery at London's Vaudeville Theatre. In the same decade, it was the subject of several silent film adaptations. Perhaps the best-known and most critically praised film adaptation is 1945's \"The Picture of Dorian Gray\", which earned an Academy Award for best black-and-white cinematography, as well as a Best Supporting Actress nomination for Angela Lansbury, who played Sibyl Vane.\nIn 2003, Stuart Townsend played Dorian Gray in the film \"League of Extraordinary Gentlemen\". In 2009, the novel was loosely adapted into the film \"Dorian Gray\", starring Ben Barnes as Dorian and Colin Firth as Lord Henry.\nAlexander Vlahos played the character in a series of audio dramas scripted by David Llewellyn in 2013. Reeve Carney portrays Dorian Gray in John Logan's \"Penny Dreadful\", which aired on Showtime from 2014 to 2016.\nThe Dorian Awards are named in honor of Wilde, in reference to \"The Picture of Dorian Gray\"; the original award was a simple certificate with an image of Wilde along with a graphic of hands holding a black bow tie. The first Dorian Awards were announced in January 2010 (nominees were revealed the previous month).\nBibliography.\nEditions include:\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "31347", "revid": "5894", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31347", "title": "Trilogy", "text": "Set of three works of art that are connected\nA trilogy is a set of three distinct works that are connected and can be seen either as a single work or as three individual works. They are commonly found in literature, film, and video games. Three-part works that are considered components of a larger work also exist, such as the triptych or the three-movement sonata, but they are not commonly referred to with the term \"trilogy\".\nMost trilogies are works of fiction involving the same characters or setting, such as \"The Deptford Trilogy\" of novels by Robertson Davies, \"The Apu Trilogy\" of films by Satyajit Ray, and \"The Kingdom Trilogy\" of television miniseries from 1994 to 2022 by Lars von Trier. Other fiction trilogies are connected only by theme: for example, each film of Krzysztof Kie\u015blowski's Three Colours trilogy explores one of the political ideals of the French Republic (liberty, equality, fraternity). Trilogies can also be connected in less obvious ways, such as \"The Nova Trilogy\" of novels by William S. Burroughs, each written using cut-up technique.\nThe term is seldom applied outside media. One example is the \"Marshall Trilogy\", a common term for three rulings written by U.S. Supreme Court Chief Justice John Marshall from 1823 to 1832 concerning the legal status of Native Americans under U.S. law.\nTrilogies\u2014and series in general\u2014are common in speculative fiction.\nHistory.\nTrilogies ( \"trilogia\") date back to ancient times. In the Dionysia festivals of ancient Greece, for example, trilogies of plays were performed followed by a fourth satyr play. \"The Oresteia\" is the only surviving trilogy of these ancient Greek plays, originally performed at the festival in Athens in 458 BC. The three Theban plays, or Oedipus cycle, by Sophocles, originating in 5th century BC, is not a true example of a trilogy because the plays were written at separate times and with different themes/purposes.\nTechnical changes in printing and film in the mid-to-late 20th century made the creation of trilogies more feasible, while the development of mass media and modern global distribution networks has made them more likely to be lucrative. Examples of trilogies in modern fiction include the Wayfarers trilogy by Knut Hamsun, the Cairo Trilogy by Naguib Mahfouz, The Border Trilogy by Cormac McCarthy, and His Dark Materials by Philip Pullman. A pivotal example is J. R. R. Tolkien's \"The Lord of the Rings\" (1954\u20131955), which was written as a single novel but published for economic reasons as three separate novels with distinct titles, thus helping to popularize the trilogy format.\nIn media.\nFilms.\nThe increase in sequels in recent years means there are a number of franchises that have produced three films, often with \"II\" and \"III\" appended to their title as an indication. Less obvious film trilogies include:\nMusic.\nThe term is less often applied to music. One example is the \"Berlin Trilogy\" of David Bowie, which is linked together by musical sound and lyrical themes, all having been recorded at least partly in Berlin, Germany. Another example can be found in the Guns N' Roses songs \"November Rain\", \"Don't Cry\" and \"Estranged\", whose videos are considered a trilogy. The Weeknd's 2012 compilation album \"Trilogy\" is a remastered and remixed collection of his 2011 mixtapes \"House of Balloons\", \"Thursday\", and \"Echoes of Silence\". Another highly notable musical trilogy is Green Day's 2012 albums \u00a1Uno!, \u00a1Dos!, and \u00a1Tr\u00e9!.\nAdding works to an existing trilogy.\nCreators of trilogies may later add more works. In such a case, the original three works may or may not keep the title \"trilogy\".\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "31348", "revid": "37371155", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31348", "title": "Thomas McKean", "text": "American Founding Father and politician (1734\u20131817)\nThomas McKean (; March 19, 1734\u00a0\u2013 June 24, 1817) was an American lawyer, politician, and Founding Father. During the American Revolution he was a Delaware delegate to the Continental Congress in Philadelphia, where he signed the Continental Association, the Declaration of Independence, and the Articles of Confederation. He served as President of Congress for four months in 1781. McKean was at various times a member of the Federalist and the Democratic-Republican parties and served as president of Delaware, chief justice of Pennsylvania, and the second governor of Pennsylvania. He also held numerous other public offices.\nEarly life and education.\nMcKean was born on March 19, 1734, in New London Township in the Province of Pennsylvania, then one of the Thirteen Colonies of British America, to William McKean and Letitia Finney. His father, William, immigrated from Ireland to the colony of Pennsylvania in 1720, and was later listed as a tavern keeper. \nWhen his mother, Letitia, died in the fall of 1742, it took a strain on Thomas's, father, William. He quickly became an alcoholic, and because of that, was incapable of raising his family. Thomas's younger sister, went to go live with their aunt and uncle, while eight-year-old Thomas, and ten-year-old, Robert began their education under Reverend Francis Alison at his school in New Castle, Delaware.\nDuring his education, McKean took on a boyhood attitude, beyond his studies. By the time he reached his adolescence, he had learned how to ride a horse and shoot a gun. Though the school was simply for boys, McKean did interact with some females, which included Reverend Alison's wife, Hannah Armitage, and her toddler half-sister, Sarah Armitage, though McKean gave her little attention, preferring to be with his friends, Charles Thomson and George Read. After a decade studying at Dr. Alison's academy, McKean's brother, Robert, left for London to study medicine, which was the first time the two were separated. \nIn 1750, McKean finally finished his studies with Dr. Alison, and shortly thereafter moved in with his uncle, John Finney, who was a wealthy lawyer at the time. During this, McKean studied with his cousin, David Finney, and after four years, in 1754, he was finally admitted to the Bar (law). \nAt some point, McKean met Mary Borden, the daughter of Colonel Joseph Borden of New Jersey. They would marry on July 21, 1763 in Mary's hometown of Bordentown. Together, they had six children, two boys, and four girls, one of whom died in childhood. Mary Borden would die on March 12, 1773, in Delaware of an unknown cause. \nShortly after the death of Mary Borden, at some point, McKean reconnected with Sarah Armitage, who he'd marry on September 16, 1774, and would live at the northeast corner of Third and Pine streets in Philadelphia. Together they would have four children, one of whom married the Spanish diplomat, Carlos Mart\u00ednez de Irujo, who was appointed to his position in 1796.\nCareer.\nIn 1755, he was admitted to the bar of the Lower Counties, as Delaware was then known, and likewise in the Province of Pennsylvania the following year. In 1756, he was appointed deputy attorney general for Sussex County. From the 1762\u20131763 session to the 1775\u20131776 session, he was a member of the General Assembly of the Lower Counties, serving as its speaker in 1772\u20131773. From July 1765, he also served as a judge of the Court of Common Pleas and began service as the customs collector at New Castle in 1771. In November 1765, his Court of Common Pleas became the first such court in the colonies to establish a rule for all the proceedings of the court to be recorded on unstamped paper. In 1768, McKean was elected to the revived American Philosophical Society.\nDelaware was politically divided in the 18th century into loose political factions known as the \"Court Party\" and the \"Country Party\". The majority Court Party was generally Anglican, was strongest in Kent and Sussex counties, worked well with the colonial Proprietary government, and supported reconciliation with the British government. The minority Country Party was largely Irish Presbyterian, also referred to as \"Scotch-Irish\", was centered in New Castle County, Delaware, and quickly advocated independence from the British. The revolutionary slogan \"no taxation without representation\" had originated in the north of Ireland under the British Penal Laws, which denied Presbyterians and Catholics the right to vote for members of the parliament. McKean was the epitome of the Country Party politician and was, as much as anyone else, its leader. As such, he generally worked in partnership with Caesar Rodney from Kent County and in opposition to his friend and neighbor, George Read.\nAt the Stamp Act Congress of 1765, McKean and Caesar Rodney represented Delaware. McKean proposed the voting procedure that the Continental Congress later adopted: each colony, regardless of size or population, would have one vote. That decision set the precedent, the Congress of the Articles of Confederation adopted the practice, and the principle of state equality has continued in the composition of the United States Senate.\nMcKean quickly became one of the most influential members of the Stamp Act Congress. He was on the committee that drew the memorial to parliament and, with John Rutledge and Philip Livingston, revised its proceedings. On the last day of its session, when the business session ended, Timothy Ruggles, the president of the body, and a few other more cautious members refused to sign the memorial of rights and grievances. McKean arose and addressing the chair insisted that the president give his reasons for his refusal. After refusing at first, Ruggles remarked that \"it was against his conscience.\" McKean then disputed his use of the word \"conscience\" so loudly and so long that a challenge was given by Ruggles and accepted in the presence of the Congress. However, Ruggles left the next morning at daybreak, and so the duel did not take place.\nAmerican Revolution.\nIn spite of his primary residence in Philadelphia, McKean remained the effective leader for American independence in Delaware. Along with Read and Caesar Rodney, he was one of Delaware's delegates to the First Continental Congress in 1774 and the Second Continental Congress in 1775 and 1776.\nBeing an outspoken advocate of independence, McKean was a key voice in persuading others to vote for a split with Great Britain. When Congress began debating a resolution of independence in June 1776, Rodney was absent. Read was against independence, which meant that the Delaware delegation was split between McKean and Read and therefore could not vote in favor of independence. McKean requested that the absent Rodney ride all night from Dover to break the tie. After the vote in favor of independence on July 2, McKean participated in the debate over the wording of the official Declaration of Independence, which was approved on July 4.\nA few days after McKean cast his vote, he left Congress to serve as colonel in command of the Fourth Battalion of the Pennsylvania Associators, a militia unit created by Benjamin Franklin in 1747. They joined General George Washington's defense of New York City at Perth Amboy, New Jersey. Being away, McKean was not available when most of the signers placed their signatures on the Declaration of Independence on August 2, 1776. Since his signature did not appear on the printed copy that was authenticated on January 17, 1777, it is assumed that he signed after that date, possibly as late as 1781.\nIn a conservative reaction against the advocates of American independence, the 1776-1777 Delaware General Assembly did not reelect either McKean or Rodney to the Continental Congress in October 1776. However, the British occupation after the Battle of Brandywine swung opinions enough that McKean was returned to Congress in October 1777 by the 1777\u20131778 Delaware General Assembly. During that time, he was constantly pursued by British forces. Over the course of the following years, he was forced to relocate his family five times.\nHe served continuously in the Congress until February 1, 1783. McKean helped draft the Articles of Confederation and voted for their adoption on March 1, 1781. When poor health caused Samuel Huntington to resign as president of Congress in July 1781, McKean was elected as his successor. He served from July 10 to November 4, 1781. The position was mostly ceremonial with no real authority, but the office required McKean to handle a good deal of correspondence and sign official documents. During his time in office, Lord Cornwallis's British army surrendered at Yorktown, which effectively ended the war.\nGovernment of Delaware.\nMeanwhile, McKean led the effort in the General Assembly of Delaware to declare its separation from the British government, which it did on June 15, 1776. In August, he was elected to the special convention to draft a new state constitution. Upon hearing of it, McKean made the long ride to Dover, Delaware, from Philadelphia in a single day, went to a room in an inn, and that night, virtually by himself, drafted the document. It was adopted September 20, 1776. The Delaware Constitution of 1776 became the first state constitution to be produced after the Declaration of Independence.\nMcKean was elected to Delaware's first House of Assembly for both the 1776\u20131777 and the 1778\u20131779 sessions, succeeding John McKinly as speaker on February 12, 1777, when McKinly became president of Delaware. Shortly after President McKinly's capture and imprisonment, McKean served as the president of Delaware for a month, from September 22 to October 20, 1777. That was the time needed for the successor George Read to return from the Continental Congress in Philadelphia and to assume the duties.\nImmediately after the Battle of Brandywine, the British Army occupied Wilmington and much of northern New Castle County. Its navy also controlled the lower Delaware River and Delaware Bay. As a result, the state capital, New Castle, was unsafe as a meeting place, and the Sussex County seat, Lewes, was sufficiently disrupted by Loyalists that it was unable to hold a valid general election that autumn. As president, McKean was primarily occupied with recruitment of the militia and with keeping some semblance of civic order in the portions of the state still under his control.\nGovernment of Pennsylvania.\nMcKean started his long tenure as chief justice of Pennsylvania on July 28, 1777, and served in that capacity until 1799. There, he largely set the rules of justice for revolutionary Pennsylvania. According to the biographer John Coleman, \"only the historiographical difficulty of reviewing court records and other scattered documents prevents recognition that McKean, rather than John Marshall, did more than anyone else to establish an independent judiciary in the United States. As chief justice under a Pennsylvania constitution he considered flawed, he assumed it the right of the court to strike down legislative acts it deemed unconstitutional, preceding by ten years the U.S. Supreme Court's establishment of the doctrine of judicial review. He augmented the rights of defendants and sought penal reform, but on the other hand was slow to recognize expansion of the legal rights of women and the processes in the state's gradual elimination of slavery.\"\nHe was a member of the convention of Pennsylvania that ratified the Constitution of the United States. In the Pennsylvania State Constitutional Convention of 1789/90, he argued for a strong executive and was himself a Federalist. Nevertheless, in 1796, dissatisfied with the Federalists' domestic policies and compromises with Great Britain, he became an outspoken Jeffersonian Republican, or Democratic-Republican.\nWhile chief justice of Pennsylvania, McKean played a role in the Whiskey Rebellion. On August 2, 1794, he took part in a conference on the rebellion. In attendance were Washington, his Cabinet, the governor of Pennsylvania, and other officials. Washington interpreted the rebellion to be a grave threat could mean \"an end to our Constitution and laws.\" Washington advocated \"the most spirited and firm measure\" but held back on what that meant. McKean argued that the matter should be left up to the courts, not the military, to prosecute and punish the rebels. Alexander Hamilton insisted upon the \"propriety of an immediate resort to Military force.\" Some weeks later, Mckean and General William Irvine wrote to Pennsylvania Governor Thomas Mifflin and discussed the mission of federal committees to negotiate with the Rebels, describing them as \"well disposed.\" However, McKean and Irvine felt the government must suppress the insurrection to prevent it from spreading to nearby counties.\nMcKean was elected governor of Pennsylvania and served three terms from December 17, 1799, to December 20, 1808. In the 1799 election, he defeated the Federalist Party nominee James Ross and again more easily in the 1802 election. At first, McKean ousted Federalists from state government positions and so he has been called the father of the spoils system. However, in seeking a third term in 1805, McKean was at odds with factions of his own Democratic-Republican Party, and the Pennsylvania General Assembly instead nominated Speaker Simon Snyder for governor. McKean then forged an alliance with Federalists, called \"the Quids,\" and defeated Snyder. Afterwards, he began removing Jeffersonians from state positions.\nThe governor's beliefs in stronger executive and judicial powers were bitterly denounced by the influential \"Aurora\" newspaper publisher William P. Duane and the Philadelphia populist Michael Leib. After they led public attacks calling for his impeachment, McKean filed a partially successful libel suit against Duane in 1805. The Pennsylvania House of Representatives impeached the governor in 1807, but, for the rest of his term, his friends prevented an impeachment trial from being held, and the matter was dropped. When the suit was settled after McKean left office, his son Joseph angrily criticized Duane's attorney for alleging out of context that McKean referred to the people of Pennsylvania as \"clodpoles\" (clodhoppers).\nSome of McKean's other accomplishments included expanding free education for all and, at age eighty, leading a Philadelphia citizens group to organize a strong defense during the War of 1812. He spent his retirement in Philadelphia in writing, discussing political affairs, and enjoying the considerable wealth that he had earned through investments and real estate.\nDeath, honors, and legacy.\nMcKean was a member of the Pennsylvania Society of the Cincinnati in 1785 and was subsequently its vice president.\nMcKean was also bestowed honorary LL.D. degrees (a) in 1781 by College of New Jersey (later renamed Princeton University), (b) in 1782 by Dartmouth College, and (c) in 1785 by his alma mater, University of Pennsylvania.\nWith University of Pennsylvania law professor James Wilson (Founding Father), McKean published \"Commentaries on the Constitution of the United States\" in 1790.\nMcKean died in Philadelphia and was buried in the First Presbyterian Church Cemetery there. In 1843, his body was moved to Laurel Hill Cemetery.\nMcKean County, Pennsylvania is named in his honor, as is Thomas McKean High School in New Castle County, also McKean Street in Philadelphia, and the McKean Hall dormitory at the University of Delaware. Penn State University also has a residence hall and a campus road named for him.\nOddly, the name of \"Keap Street\" in Brooklyn, New York, is the result of an erroneous effort to name a street after him. Many Brooklyn streets are named after signers of the Declaration of Independence, and \"Keap Street\" is the result of planners being unable to accurately read his signature. In some accounts the \"M\" of McKean was mistaken for a middle initial, and the flourish on the \"n\" in McKean led to the \"n\" being misread as a \"p\".\nMcKean was over six feet tall, and he typically wore a large cocked hat and carried a gold-headed cane. He was a man of quick temper and vigorous personality, \"with a thin face, hawk nose and hot eyes.\" John Adams described him as \"one of the three men in the Continental Congress who appeared to me to see more clearly to the end of the business than any others in the body.\" As chief justice and governor of Pennsylvania he was frequently the center of controversy.\nIn popular culture.\nIn the 1969 Broadway musical, \"1776\", McKean is portrayed as a gun-toting cantankerous old Scot who cannot get along with the wealthy and conservative planter George Read. In truth, McKean and Read belonged to opposing political factions in Delaware, but McKean was not a Scottish immigrant. His parents were Irish Presbyterians (referred to as \"Scotch-Irish\" in America and \"Ulster Scots\" by a minority in Northern Ireland). His surname is pronounced mc-CANE but was mispronounced as mc-KEEN in the film adaptation of the musical. McKean was portrayed by Bruce MacKay in the original Broadway cast and Ray Middleton in the 1972 film version.\nAlmanac.\nDelaware elections were held October 1, and members of the General Assembly took office on October 20 or the following weekday. State Assemblymen had a one-year term. The whole General Assembly chose the Continental Congressmen for a one-year term and the State President for a three-year term. Judges of the Courts of Common Pleas were also selected by the General Assembly for the life of the person appointed. McKean served as state president only temporarily, filling the vacancy created by John McKinly's capture and resignation and awaiting the arrival of George Read.\nPennsylvania elections were held in October as well. The Pennsylvania Supreme Executive Council was created in 1776 and counsellors were popularly elected for three-year terms. A joint ballot of the Pennsylvania General Assembly and the council chose the president from among the twelve counsellors for a one-year term. The chief justice of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court was also selected by the General Assembly and Council for the life of the person appointed.\nReferences.\nCitations\nSources"}

It is a conditionally essential amino acid with a polar side group. The word \"tyrosine\" is from the Greek \"tyr\u00f3s\", meaning \"cheese\", as it was first discovered in 1846 by German chemist Justus von Liebig in the protein casein from cheese. It is called tyrosyl when referred to as a functional group or side chain. While tyrosine is generally classified as a hydrophobic amino acid, it is more hydrophilic than phenylalanine. It is encoded by the codons UAC and UAU in messenger RNA.\nThe one-letter symbol Y was assigned to tyrosine for being alphabetically nearest of those letters available. Note that T was assigned to the structurally simpler threonine, U was avoided for its similarity with V for valine, W was assigned to tryptophan, while X was reserved for undetermined or atypical amino acids. The mnemonic t\"Y\"rosine was also proposed.\nFunctions.\nAside from being a proteinogenic amino acid, tyrosine has a special role by virtue of the phenol functionality. Its hydroxy group is able to form the ester linkage, with phosphate in particular. Phosphate groups are transferred to tyrosine residues by way of protein kinases. This is one of the post-translational modifications. Phosphorylated tyrosine occurs in proteins that are part of signal transduction processes.\nSimilar functionality is also presented in serine and threonine, whose side chains have a hydroxy group, but are alcohols. Phosphorylation of these three amino acids' moieties (including tyrosine) creates a negative charge on their ends, which is greater than the negative charge of the only negatively charged aspartic and glutamic acids. Phosphorylated proteins keep these same properties\u2014which are useful for more reliable protein-protein interactions\u2014by means of phosphotyrosine, phosphoserine and phosphothreonine.\nBinding sites for a signalling phosphoprotein may be diverse in their chemical structure.\nPhosphorylation of the hydroxyl group can change the activity of the target protein, or may form part of a signaling cascade via SH2 domain binding.\nA tyrosine residue also plays an important role in photosynthesis. In chloroplasts (photosystem II), it acts as an electron donor in the reduction of oxidized chlorophyll. In this process, it loses the hydrogen atom of its phenolic OH-group. This radical is subsequently reduced in the photosystem II by the four core manganese clusters.\nDietary requirements and sources.\nThe Dietary Reference Intake for tyrosine is usually estimated together with phenylalanine. It varies depending on an estimate method, however the ideal proportion of these two amino acids is considered to be 60:40 (phenylalanine:tyrosine) as a human body has such composition.\nTyrosine, which can also be synthesized in the body from phenylalanine, is found in many high-protein food products such as meat, fish, cheese, cottage cheese, milk, yogurt, peanuts, almonds, pumpkin seeds, sesame seeds, soy protein and lima beans. For example, the white of an egg has about 250\u00a0mg per egg, while beef, lamb, pork, tuna, salmon, chicken, and turkey contain about 500\u20131000\u00a0mg per portion.\nBiosynthesis.\nIn plants and most microorganisms, tyrosine is produced via prephenate, an intermediate on the shikimate pathway. Prephenate is oxidatively decarboxylated with retention of the hydroxyl group to give \"p\"-hydroxyphenylpyruvate, which is transaminated using glutamate as the nitrogen source to give tyrosine and \u03b1-ketoglutarate.\nMammals synthesize tyrosine from the essential amino acid phenylalanine (Phe), which is derived from food. The conversion of Phe to Tyr is catalyzed by the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase, a monooxygenase. This enzyme catalyzes the reaction causing the addition of a hydroxyl group to the end of the 6-carbon aromatic ring of phenylalanine, such that it becomes tyrosine.\nMetabolism.\nPhosphorylation and sulfation.\nSome of the tyrosine residues can be \"tagged\" (at the hydroxyl group) with a phosphate group (phosphorylated) by protein kinases. In its phosphorylated form, tyrosine is called phosphotyrosine. Tyrosine phosphorylation is considered to be one of the key steps in signal transduction and regulation of enzymatic activity. Phosphotyrosine can be detected through specific antibodies. Tyrosine residues may also be modified by the addition of a sulfate group, a process known as tyrosine sulfation. Tyrosine sulfation is catalyzed by tyrosylprotein sulfotransferase (TPST). Like the phosphotyrosine antibodies mentioned above, antibodies have recently been described that specifically detect sulfotyrosine.\nPrecursor to neurotransmitters and hormones.\nIn dopaminergic cells in the brain, tyrosine is converted to L-DOPA by the enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase (TH). TH is the rate-limiting enzyme involved in the synthesis of the neurotransmitter dopamine. Dopamine can then be converted into other catecholamines, such as norepinephrine (noradrenaline) and epinephrine (adrenaline).\nThe thyroid hormones triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4) in the colloid of the thyroid are also derived from tyrosine.\nPrecursor to other compounds.\nThe latex of \"Papaver somniferum\", the opium poppy, has been shown to convert tyrosine into the alkaloid morphine and the bio-synthetic pathway has been established from tyrosine to morphine by using Carbon-14 radio-labelled tyrosine to trace the in-vivo synthetic route.Tyrosine ammonia lyase (TAL) is an enzyme in the natural phenols biosynthesis pathway. It transforms -tyrosine into \"p\"-coumaric acid. Tyrosine is also the precursor to the pigment \"melanin\". Tyrosine (or its precursor phenylalanine) is needed to synthesize the benzoquinone structure which forms part of coenzyme Q10.\nDegradation.\nThe decomposition of -tyrosine (syn. \"para\"-hydroxyphenylalanine) begins with an \u03b1-ketoglutarate dependent transamination through the tyrosine transaminase to \"para\"-hydroxyphenylpyruvate. The positional description \"para\", abbreviated \"p\", mean that the hydroxyl group and side chain on the phenyl ring are across from each other (see the illustration below).\nThe next oxidation step catalyzes by \"p\"-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase and splitting off CO2 homogentisate (2,5-dihydroxyphenyl-1-acetate). In order to split the aromatic ring of homogentisate, a further dioxygenase, homogentisate 1,2-dioxygenase is required. Thereby, through the incorporation of a further O2 molecule, maleylacetoacetate is created.\nFumarylacetoacetate is created by maleylacetoacetate \"cis\"-\"trans\"-isomerase through rotation of the carboxyl group created from the hydroxyl group via oxidation. This \"cis-trans\"-isomerase contains glutathione as a coenzyme. Fumarylacetoacetate is finally split by the enzyme fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase through the addition of a water molecule.\nThereby fumarate (also a metabolite of the citric acid cycle) and acetoacetate (3-ketobutyroate) are liberated. Acetoacetate is a ketone body, which is activated with succinyl-CoA, and thereafter it can be converted into acetyl-CoA, which in turn can be oxidized by the citric acid cycle or be used for fatty acid synthesis.\nPhloretic acid is also a urinary metabolite of tyrosine in rats.\nOrtho- and meta-tyrosine.\nThree structural isomers of -tyrosine are known. In addition to the common amino acid -tyrosine, which is the para isomer (\"para\"-tyr, \"p\"-tyr or 4-hydroxyphenylalanine), there are two additional regioisomers, namely \"meta\"-tyrosine (also known as 3-hydroxyphenylalanine, L-\"m\"-tyrosine, and \"m\"-tyr) and \"ortho\"-tyrosine (\"o\"-tyr or 2-hydroxyphenylalanine), that occur in nature. The \"m\"-tyr and \"o\"-tyr isomers, which are rare, arise through non-enzymatic free-radical hydroxylation of phenylalanine under conditions of oxidative stress.\nMedical use.\nTyrosine is a precursor to neurotransmitters and increases plasma neurotransmitter levels (particularly dopamine and norepinephrine), but has little if any effect on mood in normal subjects.\nA 2015 systematic review found that \"tyrosine loading acutely counteracts decrements in working memory and information processing that are induced by demanding situational conditions such as extreme weather or cognitive load\" and therefore \"tyrosine may benefit healthy individuals exposed to demanding situational conditions\".\nIndustrial synthesis.\n-Tyrosine is used in pharmaceuticals, dietary supplements, and food additives. Two methods were formerly used to manufacture -tyrosine. The first involves the extraction of the desired amino acid from protein hydrolysates using a chemical approach. The second utilizes enzymatic synthesis from phenolics, pyruvate, and ammonia through the use of tyrosine phenol-lyase. Advances in genetic engineering and the advent of industrial fermentation have shifted the synthesis of L-tyrosine to the use of engineered strains of \"E. coli\".\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Before that, he was deputy president under Nelson Mandela from 1994 to 1999.\nThe son of Govan Mbeki, an ANC intellectual, Mbeki has been involved in ANC politics since 1956, when he joined the ANC Youth League, and has been a member of the party's National Executive Committee since 1975. Born in the Transkei, he left South Africa aged twenty to attend university in England, and spent almost three decades in exile abroad, until the ANC was unbanned in 1990. He rose through the organisation in its information and publicity section and as Oliver Tambo's prot\u00e9g\u00e9, but he was also an experienced diplomat, serving as the ANC's official representative in several of its African outposts. He was an early advocate for and leader of the diplomatic engagements which led to the negotiations to end apartheid. After South Africa's first democratic elections in 1994, he was appointed national deputy president. In subsequent years, it became apparent that he was Mandela's chosen successor, and he was elected unopposed as ANC president in 1997, enabling his rise to the presidency as the ANC's candidate in the 1999 elections.\nWhile deputy president, Mbeki had been regarded as a steward of the government's Growth, Employment and Redistribution policy, introduced in 1996, and as president he continued to subscribe to relatively conservative, market-friendly macroeconomic policies. During his presidency, South Africa experienced falling public debt, a narrowing budget deficit, and consistent, moderate economic growth. However, despite his retention of various social democratic programmes, and notable expansions to the black economic empowerment programme, critics often regarded Mbeki's economic policies as neoliberal, with insufficient consideration for developmental and redistributive objectives. On these grounds, Mbeki grew increasingly alienated from the left wing of the ANC, and from the leaders of the ANC's Tripartite Alliance partners, the Congress of South African Trade Unions and South African Communist Party. It was these leftist elements which supported Jacob Zuma over Mbeki in the political rivalry that erupted after Mbeki removed the latter from his post as deputy president in 2005.\nAs president, Mbeki had an apparent predilection for foreign policy and particularly for multilateralism. His pan-Africanism and vision for an \"African renaissance\" are central parts of his political persona, and commentators suggest that he secured for South Africa a role in African and global politics that was disproportionate to the country's size and historical influence. He was the central architect of the New Partnership for Africa's Development and, as the inaugural chairperson of the African Union, spearheaded the introduction of the African Peer Review Mechanism. After the IBSA Dialogue Forum was launched in 2003, his government collaborated with India and Brazil to lobby for reforms at the United Nations, advocating for a stronger role for developing countries. Among South Africa's various peacekeeping commitments during his presidency, Mbeki was the primary mediator in the conflict between ZANU-PF and the Zimbabwean opposition in the 2000s. However, he was frequently criticised for his policy of \"quiet diplomacy\" in Zimbabwe, under which he refused to condemn Robert Mugabe's regime or institute sanctions against it.\nAlso highly controversial worldwide was Mbeki's HIV/AIDS policy. His government did not introduce a national mother-to-child transmission prevention programme until 2002, when it was mandated by the Constitutional Court, nor did it make antiretroviral therapy available in the public healthcare system until late 2003. Subsequent studies have estimated that these delays caused hundreds of thousands of preventable deaths. Mbeki himself, like his Health Minister Manto Tshabalala-Msimang, has been described as an AIDS denialist, \"dissident\", or sceptic. Although he did not explicitly deny the causal link between HIV and AIDS, he often posited a need to investigate alternate causes of and alternative treatments for AIDS, frequently suggesting that immunodeficiency was the indirect result of poverty.\nHis political descent began at the ANC's Polokwane conference in December 2007, when he was replaced as ANC president by Zuma. Although his term as national president was not due to expire until June 2009, he announced on 20 September 2008 that he would resign at the request of the ANC National Executive Committee. The ANC's decision to \"recall\" Mbeki was understood to be linked to a High Court judgement, handed down earlier that month, in which judge Chris Nicholson had alleged improper political interference in the National Prosecuting Authority and specifically in the corruption charges against Zuma. Nicholson's judgement was overturned by the Supreme Court of Appeal in January 2009, by which time Mbeki had been replaced as president by Kgalema Motlanthe.\nEarly life and education.\n1942\u201360: Eastern Cape.\nMbeki was born on 18 June 1942 in Mbewuleni, a small village in the former homeland of Transkei, now part of the Eastern Cape. The second of four siblings, he had one sister, Linda (born 1941, died 2003), and two brothers, Moeletsi (born 1945) and Jama (born 1948, died 1982).54 His parents were Epainette (died 2014), a trained teacher, and Govan (died 2001), a shopkeeper, teacher, journalist, and senior activist in the African National Congress (ANC) and the South African Communist Party (SACP). Both Epainette and Govan came from educated, Christian, land-owning families, and Govan's father was Sikelewu Mbeki, a colonially appointed headman.4 The couple had met in Durban, where Epainette had become the second black woman to join the SACP (then still called the Communist Party of South Africa); however, while Mbeki was a child, his family was separated when Govan moved alone to Ladismith for a teaching job. Mbeki has said that he was \"born into the struggle\", and recalls that his childhood home was decorated with portraits of Karl Marx and Mahatma Gandhi. Govan named him after senior South African communist Thabo Mofutsanyana.\nMbeki began attending school in 1948, the same year that the National Party was elected with a mandate to legislate apartheid.' The Bantu Education Act was implemented towards the end of his school career, and in 1955 he arrived at the Lovedale Institute, an eminent mission school outside Alice, as part of the last class which would be permitted to follow the same curriculum as white students. At Lovedale, he was a year behind Chris Hani, his future colleague and rival in the ANC.95 Mbeki joined the ANC Youth League at age fourteen and in 1958 became the secretary of its Lovedale branch. Shortly afterwards, at the start of his final year of high school, he was identified as one of the leaders of a March 1959 boycott of classes, and was summarily expelled from Lovedale.' He nonetheless sat for matric examinations and obtained a second-class pass.\n1960\u201362: Johannesburg.\nIn June 1960, Mbeki moved to Johannesburg, where he lived in the home of ANC secretary general Duma Nokwe and where he intended to sit for A-level examinations. The ANC had recently been banned in the aftermath of the Sharpeville massacre, but Mbeki remained highly politically active, becoming national secretary of the African Students' Association, a new (and short-lived) youth movement envisaged as replacing the now illegal ANC Youth League. It was also during this period that Nokwe recruited Mbeki into the SACP.\nThus the ANC instructed him to join the growing cohort of cadres who were leaving South Africa to evade police attention, receive training, and establish the overt ANC structures that were now illegal inside the country. Mbeki was detained twice by the police while attempting to leave the country, first in Rustenberg, when the group he was travelling with failed to pass themselves off as a touring football team, and then in Rhodesia.' He arrived at the ANC's new headquarters in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, in November 1962, and left shortly afterwards for England.'\nExile and early career.\n1962\u201369: England.\nWhile at Sussex, Mbeki was involved in ANC work and in broader organising for the English Anti-Apartheid Movement. Months after his arrival, his father was arrested during a Security Branch raid at Liliesleaf Farm in July 1963. During the ensuing Rivonia Trial, Mbeki appeared before the United Nations (UN) Special Committee on Apartheid and later led a student march from Brighton to London, a distance of fifty miles. At the conclusion of the trial, Govan and seven other ANC leaders, among them Nelson Mandela and Walter Sisulu, were sentenced to life imprisonment.\nMbeki completed his bachelor's degree in economics in May 1965 but, at the exhortation of O. R. Tambo, enrolled for a Master's in economics and development instead of returning to Africa to join Umkhonto we Sizwe (MK), the ANC's armed wing. His Master's dissertation was in economic geography. In addition to this and his political organising, he developed a deep fondness for Yeats, Brecht, Shakespeare, and blues music.195After completing his Master's, in October 1966 he moved to London to work full-time for the propaganda section of the ANC's English headquarters.251He remained active in the SACP, which was very closely allied to the ANC, and in 1967 he was appointed to the editorial board of its official magazine, the \"African Communist\".221\nThroughout his time in England, Mbeki was the ward of O. R. Tambo and his wife Adelaide Tambo \u2013 in the absence of his parents, it was Adelaide and senior communist Michael Harmel who attended Mbeki's graduation ceremony in 1965.218 O. R. Tambo later became the ANC's longest-serving president, and he acted as Mbeki's \"political mentor and patron\" until his death in 1993. Other friends Mbeki made in England, including Ronnie Kasrils and brothers Essop Pahad and Aziz Pahad, were also among his key political allies in his later career.\n1969\u201371: Soviet Union.\nIn February 1969, Mbeki was sent to Moscow in the Soviet Union to receive Marxist\u2013Leninist political and ideological training \u2013 a fairly common practice, and even a rite of passage, among young people identified as belonging to the future generation of ANC and SACP political leaders. He was educated at the Lenin Institute, where, because of the secrecy required, he went by the alias \"Jack Fortune\".' He excelled at the institute and in June 1970 was appointed to the Central Committee of the SACP, alongside Chris Hani.277 The last part of his training entailed military training, also a rite of passage, including in intelligence, guerrilla tactics, and weaponry. However, his biographer Mark Gevisser adduces that he was \"not the ideal candidate for military life\", and Max Sisulu, who trained alongside him, says that he always regarded Mbeki as better suited to political leadership than military leadership.'\n1971\u201375: Lusaka.\nIn April 1971, having been pulled out from military training, Mbeki was sent to Lusaka, Zambia, where the ANC-in-exile had set up its new headquarters under acting president Tambo. He was to fill the post of administrative secretary to the ANC Revolutionary Council, a body newly established to coordinate the political and military efforts of the ANC and SACP.289 He was later moved to the propaganda section, but continued to attend the council's meetings, and in 1975 he (again alongside Hani) was elected onto the ANC's top decision-making organ, the National Executive Committee.296, 317 It was during this period that he began to ghostwrite some of Tambo's speeches and reports, and he accompanied Tambo on important occasions, such as to the infamous December 1972 meeting with Mangosuthu Buthelezi, the head of Inkatha, in London. In 1973, he helped to establish the ANC's office in Botswana, considered a \"frontline\" country because of its shared border with South Africa, where the ANC was attempting to re-establish its underground.317 However, although he travelled frequently in subsequent years, the ANC's Lusaka headquarters remained his central base.\n1975\u201376: Swaziland.\nBetween 1975 and 1976, Mbeki was instrumental in establishing the ANC's frontline base in Swaziland. He was first sent there to assess the political landscape in January 1975, under the cover of attending a UN conference. As part of this reconnaissance trip, he and his colleague Max Sisulu spent time with S'bu Ndebele, Max's sister Lindiwe Sisulu, and their associates in the Black Consciousness movement, which at the time was ascendent in neighbouring South Africa.' Mbeki made a positive report to the ANC executive, and he was sent back to Swaziland to begin establishing the base. In Swaziland, he lived at Stanley Mabizela's family home in Manzini. Working with Albert Dhlomo, Mbeki was responsible for helping to re-establish underground ANC networks in the South African provinces of Natal and Transvaal, which shared a border with Swaziland. His counterpart inside South Africa was MK operative Jacob Zuma, who ran the Natal underground. According to Gevisser, the pair developed \"an unlikely rapport\".' Mbeki was also responsible for recruiting new MK operatives, for liaising with South African student and labour activists, and for liaising with Inkatha, which was becoming dominant in Natal.\nHowever, still another part of his duties was to act as the ANC's official representative in the country, and to maintain good diplomatic relations with the Swazi government. In March 1976, the government discovered that Mbeki was involved in military activity inside Swaziland, and he and Dhlomo \u2013 as well as Zuma, who was in the country illegally \u2013 were detained and then deported, though they managed to negotiate their deportation to the neutral territory of Mozambique rather than to South Africa.' Mbeki's management of the Swaziland base later became a point of contention between him and Mac Maharaj, with whom his relationship has remained acrimonious decades later. In 1978, Maharaj and Mbeki argued at a top-level strategic meeting in Luanda, Angola, when Maharaj, who had been tasked with running the political underground, claimed that Mbeki's records from the Swaziland office were in fact \"just an empty folder\".'\n1976\u201378: Nigeria.\nAfter being deported, Mbeki returned to Lusaka, where he was made Duma Nokwe's deputy in the ANC's Department of Information and Propaganda (DIP). In January 1977, he was posted to Lagos, Nigeria, where he was to be \u2013 as in Swaziland \u2013 the ANC's first representative to the country. Although there was some debate about whether the appointment was a signal that he had been sidelined, Gevisser says that Mbeki performed well in Lagos, establishing good relations with Olusegun Obasanjo's regime and establishing an ANC presence to eclipse that of its rival Pan Africanist Congress (PAC).\n1978\u201380: Political secretary.\nWhen he returned to Lusaka from Lagos in 1978, he was promoted again: he replaced Nokwe as head of DIP, and simultaneously was appointed Tambo's political secretary, an extremely influential position in which he became one of Tambo's closest advisors and confidantes. He also continued to ghostwrite for Tambo, now in a formal capacity.' At DIP, his approach was encapsulated by the change he made to the department's name, replacing \"propaganda\" with \"publicity\". He eschewed the secrecy of earlier years and openly gave interviews and access to American journalists, to the disapproval of some hardline communists. According to various sources, he was responsible for reforming the public image of the ANC from that of a terrorist organisation to that of a \"government-in-waiting\".'\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n When I look at Thabo, I look at my husband's son. Physically, they bear a striking resemblance... They are both perfectionists, but without the intolerance that comes from many who share that quality. They are loyal and true. They are their own harshest critics. They both have the gift to draw people to them... They were soul mates, different generations fusing at that particular time.\n \u2014 Adelaide Tambo reflects on Mbeki's relationship with O. R. Tambo, June 2002\nHe established some of his own high-level intelligence networks, with key underground operatives reporting directly to him, and Gevisser claims that these led to the initiation of relationships with many of the domestic activists who later became his political allies. Moreover, he was responsible for innovating some of the vocabulary which became emblematic of the 1980s anti-apartheid struggle, which burgeoned in the aftermath of the 1976 Soweto uprising. Such phrases as \"mass democratic movement\", \"people's power\", and the exhortation to \"make the country ungovernable\" are attributed to Mbeki, and gained widespread popularity inside South Africa through Radio Freedom broadcasts written by DIP or by Mbeki personally.' Zuma has said that it was Mbeki's \"drafting skills\" which enabled his ascendancy in the ANC and ultimately to the presidency.'\nIn 1980, Mbeki led the ANC's delegation to Zimbabwe, where the party hoped to establish relations with Robert Mugabe's newly elected government. This was a sensitive mission, because the ANC had historically been strongly allied to the Zimbabwe African People's Union, the arch rival of Mugabe's ZANU-PF. Working primarily through Mugabe's righthand man, future Zimbabwean president Emmerson Mnangagwa, Mbeki negotiated an extraordinarily congenial agreement between ZANU-PF and the ANC. The agreement allowed the ANC to open an office in Zimbabwe and to move MK weapons and cadres over Zimbabwean borders; moreover, it committed the Zimbabwean military to assisting the ANC, and the government to providing MK cadres with Zimbabwean identity documents. However, Mbeki handed the running of the Salisbury office over to another ANC official, and the deal later collapsed.\n1980s: Negotiations.\nIn 1985, PW Botha declared a State of Emergency and gave the army and police special powers. In 1986, the South African Army sent a captain in the South African Defence Force (SADF) to kill Mbeki. The plan was to put a bomb in his house in Lusaka, but the assassin was arrested by the Zambian police before he could go through with the plan. Also in 1985, Mbeki became the ANC's director of the Department of Information and Publicity and coordinated diplomatic campaigns to involve more white South Africans in anti-apartheid activities. In 1989, he rose in the ranks to head the ANC's Department of International Affairs and was involved in the ANC's negotiations with the South African government. Mbeki played a major role in turning the international media against apartheid. Raising the diplomatic profile of the ANC, Mbeki acted as a point of contact for foreign governments and international organisations and he was extremely successful in this position. Mbeki also played the role of ambassador to the steady flow of delegates from the elite sectors of white South Africa. These included academics, clerics, business people and representatives of liberal white groups who travelled to Lusaka to assess the ANC's views on a democratic, free South Africa.\nMbeki was seen as pragmatic, eloquent, rational, and urbane. He was known for his diplomatic style and sophistication. In the early 1980s, Mbeki, Jacob Zuma and Aziz Pahad were appointed by Tambo to conduct private talks with representatives of the National Party government. Twelve meetings between the parties took place between November 1987 and May 1990, most of them held at Mells Park House, a country house near Bath in Somerset, England. By September 1989, the team secretly met with Maritz Spaarwater and Mike Louw in a hotel in Switzerland. Known as \"Operation Flair\", PW Botha was kept informed of all the meetings. At the same time, Mandela and Kobie Coetzee, the Minister of Justice, were also holding secret talks. When Mbeki finally was able to return home to South Africa and was reunited with his own father, the elder Mbeki told a reporter, \"You must remember that Thabo Mbeki is no longer my son. He is my comrade!\" A news article pointed out that this was an expression of pride, explaining, \"For Govan Mbeki, a son was a mere biological appendage; to be called a comrade, on the other hand, was the highest honour.\"\nIn the late 1970s, Mbeki made a number of trips to the United States in search of support among US corporations. Literate and funny, he made a wide circle of friends in New York City. Mbeki was appointed head of the ANC's information department in 1984 and then became head of the international department in 1989, reporting directly to Oliver Tambo, then President of the ANC. Tambo was Mbeki's long-time mentor. In 1985, Mbeki was a member of a delegation that began meeting secretly with representatives of the South African business community, and in 1989, he led the ANC delegation that conducted secret talks with the South African government. These talks led to the unbanning of the ANC and the release of political prisoners. He also participated in many of the other important negotiations between the ANC and the government that eventually led to the democratisation of South Africa. As a sign of goodwill, de Klerk set free a few of the ANC's top leadership at the end of 1989, among them Govan Mbeki.\nRise to the presidency.\nOn 2 February 1990, Botha's successor as state president, F. W. de Klerk, announced that the ANC and other political organisations would be unbanned, and ANC exiles began to return to South Africa. At the same time that it was to negotiate the end of apartheid, the ANC had to implement a significant internal reorganisation, absorbing into its official exile bodies the domestic ANC underground, released political prisoners, and other activists from the trade unions and the United Democratic Front. It also had an ageing leadership, meaning that a new generation of leaders had to be prepared for succession.\n1993: ANC chairperson.\nIn the late 1980s and early 1990s, Mbeki's key role in the early negotiations made him a likely contender for top leadership positions in the party, and he was even considered to be in line for the ANC presidency. However, at the ANC's 48th National Conference in July 1991, its first national elective conference since 1960, Mbeki was not elected to any of the \"Top Six\" leadership positions. Sisulu was elected ANC deputy president, almost certainly as a compromise candidate, and trade unionist Cyril Ramaphosa was elected secretary general. According to historian Tom Lodge, Ramaphosa's election was a putsch carried out by the party's \"internal wing\", in defiance of the former exiles and political prisoners who had hitherto dominated the ANC's leadership. Over the next three years, Ramaphosa also came to eclipse Mbeki as the party's central negotiator when he, not Mbeki, was appointed to lead the ANC's delegation to the CODESA talks. Once SACP leader Chris Hani was assassinated in April 1993, Ramaphosa became Mbeki's primary competition in the ANC succession battle. When Tambo died later the same month, Mbeki succeeded him as ANC national chairperson.\n1994: Deputy president.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nWell, I don't imagine that there's any such requirement. I mean, he's got very big feet. The shoes will be too big. What does that mean? Does it mean we start off by going to jail for 27 years and then sort of graduate from there, grow taller, wear strange shirts? It's not a rational expectation.\n\u2014 Mbeki in 1997, on filling Mandela's shoes\nFollowing the 1994 elections, South Africa's first under universal suffrage, Mbeki became one of the two national deputy presidents in the ANC-led Government of National Unity, in which Mandela was president. At the ANC's next national conference, held in December that year, Mbeki was elected unopposed to the ANC deputy presidency, also under Mandela. In June 1996, the National Party withdrew from the Government of National Unity and, with the second deputy, de Klerk, having thereby resigned, Mbeki became the sole deputy president.\nThe same year, as deputy president, Mbeki acted as a peace broker in what was then known as Zaire, following the First Congo War and the deposition of Zairean president Mobutu Sese Seko. Mbeki also took on increasing domestic responsibilities, including executive powers delegated to him by Mandela, to such an extent that Mandela called him \"a \"de facto\" president\". Mandela had made it clear publicly since early 1995 or earlier that he intended to retire after one term in office, and by then Mbeki was already seen as his most likely successor.\n1997: ANC president.\nIn December 1997, the ANC's 50th National Conference elected Mbeki unopposed to succeed Mandela as ANC president. On some accounts, the election was not contested because the top leadership had prepared assiduously for the conference, lobbying and negotiating on Mbeki's behalf in the interest of unity and continuity. Pursuant to the 1999 national elections, which the ANC won by a significant majority, Mbeki was elected president of South Africa. He was re-elected for a second term in 2002.\nPresidency of South Africa.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nOurs is a capitalist society. It is therefore inevitable that, in part \u2013 and I repeat, in part \u2013 we must address this goal of deracialisation within the context of the property relations characteristic [of] a capitalist economy.\n\u2014 Mbeki in 1999\nEconomic policy.\nMbeki had been highly involved in economic policy as deputy president, especially in spearheading the Growth, Employment and Redistribution (GEAR) programme, which was introduced in 1996 and remained a cornerstone of Mbeki's administration after 1999. In comparison to the Reconstruction and Development Programme policy which had been the basis of the ANC's platform in 1994, GEAR placed less emphasis on developmental and redistributive imperatives, and subscribed to elements of the liberalisation, deregulation, and privatisation at the centre of Washington Consensus-style reforms. It was therefore viewed by some as a \"policy reversal\" and embrace of neoliberalism, and thus as an abandonment of the ANC's socialist principles. Mbeki also emphasised communication between government, business, and labour, establishing four working groups \u2013 for big business, black business, trade unions, and commercial agriculture \u2013 under which ministers, senior officials, and Mbeki himself met regularly with business and union leaders to build trust and explore solutions to structural economic problems. \nConservative groups such as the Cato Institute commended Mbeki's macroeconomic policies, which reduced the budget deficit and public debt and which according to them likely played a role in increasing economic growth. According to the Free Market Foundation, during the Mbeki presidency, average annualised quarter-on-quarter GDP growth was 4.2%, and average annual inflation was 5.7%. On the other hand, the shift alienated leftists, including inside in the ANC and its Tripartite Alliance. Zwelinzima Vavi of the Congress of South African Trade Unions (COSATU) was an outspoken critic of Mbeki's \"market-friendly\" economic policies, claiming that Mbeki's \"flirtation\" with neoliberalism had been \"absolutely disastrous\" for development, and especially for the labour-intensive development required to address South Africa's high unemployment rate. The discord between Mbeki and the left was on public display by December 2002, when Mbeki attacked what he called divisive \"ultra-leftists\" in a speech to the ANC's 51st National Conference.\nHowever, Mbeki clearly never subscribed to undiluted neoliberalism. He retained various social democratic programmes and principles, and generally endorsed a mixed economy in South Africa. One of the ANC's slogans in the campaign for his 2004 re-election was, \"A people's contract for growth and development.\" He popularised the concept of a dual or two-track economy in South Africa, with severe underdevelopment in one segment of the population, and, for example in a 2003 newsletter, argued that high growth alone would only benefit the developed segment, without significant trickle-down benefits for the rest of the population. Yet, somewhat paradoxically, he explicitly advocated state support for the creation of a black capitalist class in South Africa. The government's black economic empowerment policy, which was expanded and consolidated under his administration, was criticised precisely for benefitting only a small black elite and thereby failing to address inequality.\nForeign policy.\nAccording to academic and diplomat Gerrit Olivier, during his presidency Mbeki \"succeeded in placing Africa high on the global agenda.\" He was known for his pan-Africanism, having emphasised related themes both in his famous \"I am an African\" speech in 1996 and in his first speech to Parliament as president in June 1999, when he foregrounded his trademark ideal of an \"African renaissance\". He advocated for greater solidarity among African countries and, in place of reliance on Western intervention and aid, for greater self-sufficiency for the African continent. Simultaneously, however, he argued for increased developmental aid to Africa. He called for Western leaders to address global apartheid and unequal development, most memorably in a speech to the World Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg in August 2002.\nAfrica.\nAlthough Mbeki also forged strategic individual relationships with key African leaders, especially the heads of state of Nigeria, Algeria, Mozambique, and Tanzania, perhaps his central foreign policy instrument was multilateral cooperation. Mbeki's government, and Mbeki personally, are frequently cited as the single most significant driving force behind the creation in 2001 of the New Partnership for Africa's Development (NEPAD), which aims to develop a framework for accelerating economic development and cooperation in Africa. Olivier calls Mbeki the \"seminal thinker\" behind NEPAD and its \"principal author and articulator\". According to academic Chris Landsberg, NEPAD's central principle \u2013 \"African leaders holding one another accountable in exchange for the recommitment of the industrialised world to Africa's development\" \u2013 epitomised Mbeki's strategy in Africa. Mbeki was also involved in the dissolution of the Organisation of African Unity and its replacement by the African Union (AU), of which he became the inaugural chairperson in 2002, and his government spearheaded the introduction of the AU's African Peer Review Mechanism in 2003. He was twice chairperson of the Southern African Development Community (SADC), first from 1999 to 2000 and second, briefly, in 2008. Through these multilateral organisations and by contributing forces to various United Nations (UN) peacekeeping missions, Mbeki and his government were involved in peacekeeping initiatives in African countries including Zimbabwe, Ethiopia and Eritrea, Liberia, the Democratic Republic of Congo, and Burundi.\nGlobal South.\nOutside Africa, Mbeki was the chairperson of the Non-Aligned Movement between 1999 and 2003 and the chairperson of the Group of 77 + China in 2006. He also pursued South-South solidarity in a coalition with India and Brazil under the IBSA Dialogue Forum, which was launched in June 2003 and held its first summit in September 2006. The IBSA countries together pressed for changes in the agricultural subsidy regimes of developed countries at the 2003 World Trade Organisation conference, and also pressed for reforms at the UN which would allow developing countries a stronger role. Indeed, Mbeki had called for reform at the UN as early as 1999 and 2000. In 2007, following a prolonged diplomatic campaign, South Africa secured a non-permanent seat on the UN Security Council for a two-year term. Controversially, in February 2007, South Africa followed Russia and China in voting against a draft resolution calling for an end to political detentions and military attacks against ethnic minorities in Myanmar. Mbeki later told the media that the resolution exceeded the Security Council's mandate, and that its tabling had been illegal in terms of international law.\nQuiet diplomacy in Zimbabwe.\nMbeki's presidency coincided with an escalating political and economic crisis in South Africa's neighbour, Zimbabwe, under president Mugabe of ZANU-PF. Problems included land invasions under the \"fast-track\" land reform programme, political violence and state-sponsored human rights violations, and hyperinflation. With SADC's endorsement, Mbeki frequently acted as a mediator between ZANU-PF and the Zimbabwean opposition. However, controversially, his policy towards the Mugabe regime was one of non-confrontational \"quiet diplomacy\" and \"constructive engagement\": he refused to condemn Mugabe and instead attempted to persuade him to accept gradual political reforms. He was firmly opposed to forcible or manufactured regime change in Zimbabwe, and also opposed the use of sanctions. The \"Economist\" posited an \"Mbeki doctrine\" holding that South Africa \"cannot impose its will on others, but it can help to deal with instability in African countries by offering its resources and its leadership to bring rival groups together, and to keep things calm until an election is safely held.\" Mbeki said in 2004:&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;...the critical role we should play is to assist the Zimbabweans to find each other, really to agree among themselves about the political, economic, social, other solutions that their country needs. We could have stepped aside from that task and then shouted, and that would be the end of our contribution... They would shout back at us and that would be the end of the story. I'm actually the only head of government that I know anywhere in the world who has actually gone to Zimbabwe and spoken publicly very critically of the things that they are doing.The motives behind Mbeki's Zimbabwe policy have been interpreted in various ways: for example, some suggest that he was attempting to maintain economic stability in Zimbabwe and therefore to protect South African economic interests, while others cite his attachment to ideals of African solidarity and opposition to what he perceived as quasi-imperial Western interference in Africa. In any case, Mbeki's policy on Zimbabwe attracted widespread criticism both domestically and internationally. Some also questioned Mbeki's neutrality in his role as mediator. After a South African observer mission endorsed the result of the Zimbabwean presidential election of 2002, in which Mugabe was re-elected, Zimbabwean opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai accused Mbeki of being a \"dishonest broker\" and his government of becoming \"part of the Zimbabwe problem because its actions are worsening the crisis.\" Commentators later said that Mbeki's soft stance on Mugabe during this period permanently damaged relations between South Africa and the Zimbabwean opposition. A South African government observer mission also endorsed the result of the Zimbabwean parliamentary elections of 2005, apparently leading Tsvangirai's party, the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), to effectively sever relations with Mbeki's administration. \nPower-sharing negotiations.\nFollowing another contested election in Zimbabwe \u2013 after which Mbeki controversially denied that there was a \"crisis\" in Zimbabwe \u2013 the MDC and ZANU-PF entered into negotiations towards the formation of a power-sharing government, with talks beginning in July 2008. Mbeki mediated the negotiations and brokered the resulting power-sharing agreement, signed on 15 September 2008, which retained Mugabe as president but diluted his executive power across posts to be held by opposition leaders.\nHIV/AIDS.\nPolicy and treatment.\nAccording to political scientist Jeffrey Herbst, Mbeki's HIV/AIDS policies were \"bizarre at best, severely negligent at worst.\" In 2000, amid a burgeoning HIV/AIDS epidemic in South Africa, Mbeki's government launched the \"HIV/AIDS/STD Strategic Plan for South Africa, 2000\u20132005\", a \"multi-sectoral\" plan which was criticised by HIV/AIDS activists for lacking concrete timeframes and failing to commit to antiretroviral treatment programmes. Indeed, according to economist Nicoli Nattrass, resistance to the roll-out of antiretroviral drugs for prevention and treatment became central to the HIV/AIDS policy of Mbeki's government in subsequent years. A national mother-to-child transmission prevention programme was not introduced until 2002, when it was mandated by the Constitutional Court in response to a successful legal challenge by the Treatment Action Campaign. Similarly, chronic highly active antiretroviral therapy for AIDS-sick people was not introduced in the public healthcare system until late 2003, reportedly at the insistence of some members of Mbeki's cabinet. According to Nattrass, better access to antiretroviral drugs in South Africa could have prevented about 171,000 HIV infections and 343,000 deaths between 1999 and 2007. In November 2008, a Harvard University study estimated that more than 330,000 people died between 2000 and 2005 due to insufficient antiretroviral programmes under Mbeki's government.\nEven after these programmes were introduced, Mbeki's appointee as Minister of Health, Manto Tshabalala-Msimang, continued to advocate publicly for unproven alternative treatments in place of antiretrovirals, leading to continual calls by civil society for her dismissal. In late 2006, the cabinet transferred responsibility for AIDS policy from Tshabalala-Msimang to Deputy President Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka, who subsequently spearheaded a new draft National Strategic Plan on HIV/AIDS.\nAssociation with denialism.\nWhile president, Mbeki was also criticised for his public messaging on HIV/AIDS. He was viewed as sympathetic to or influenced by the views of a small minority of scientists who challenged the scientific consensus that HIV caused AIDS and that antiretroviral drugs were the most effective means of treatment. In an April 2000 letter to UN secretary-general Kofi Annan and the heads of state of the United States, United Kingdom, Germany, and France, Mbeki pointed to differences in how the AIDS epidemic had manifested in Africa and in the West, and committed to \"the search for specific and targeted responses to the specifically African incidence of HIV-AIDS.\" He also defended scientists who had challenged the scientific consensus on AIDS: &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The letter was leaked to \"The Washington Post\" and caused controversy. During the same period, Mbeki convened a panel to investigate the cause of AIDS, staffed by researchers who believed that AIDS was caused by malnutrition and parasites as well as by orthodox researchers. In July 2000, opening the 13th International AIDS Conference in Durban, he proposed that the \"disturbing phenomenon of the collapse of immune systems among millions of our people\" was the result of various factors, especially poverty, and that \"we could not blame everything on a single virus.\" It was characteristic of Mbeki's stance on HIV/AIDS to draw attention to socioeconomic differences between the West and Africa, emphasising the importance of poverty in poor health outcomes in Africa, and to insist that African countries should not be asked blindly to accept Western scientific theories and policy models. Commentators speculate that his stance was motivated by suspicion of the West and was a response to what he perceived as racist stereotypes of the continent and its people. For example, in October 2001, in a speech at the University of Fort Hare, he said of the West: \"Convinced that we are but natural-born, promiscuous carriers of germs, unique in the world, they proclaim that our continent is doomed to an inevitable mortal end because of our unconquerable devotion to the sin of lust.\"\nMbeki announced in October 2000 that he would withdraw from the public debate on HIV/AIDS science, and in 2002 his cabinet staunchly affirmed that HIV causes AIDS. However, critics claimed that he continued to influence \u2013 and impede \u2013 HIV/AIDS policy, a charge which Mbeki denied. AIDS activist Zackie Achmat said in 2002 that \"Mbeki epitomizes leadership in denial and his stand has fuelled government inaction.\" Gevisser writes that in 2007 Mbeki continued to defend his position on HIV/AIDS, and directed Gevisser to a controversial and anonymous ANC discussion document titled \"Castro Hlongwane, Caravans, Cats, Geese, Foot &amp; Mouth and Statistics: HIV/Aids and the Struggle for the Humanisation of the African\". The Gevisser biography also says that, while Mbeki never explicitly denied the link between HIV and AIDS, he is a \"profound sceptic\" \u2013 as Mbeki himself wrote in 2016, in a newsletter cautioning \"great care and caution\" in the use of antiretrovirals, he had not denied that HIV caused AIDS but that \"a virus [could] cause a syndrome.\" He is generally referred to as an HIV/AIDS \"dissident\" rather than an outright denialist, although Nattrass questions the value of that distinction.\nFIFA World Cup bid.\nAs president, Mbeki spearheaded South Africa's successful bid to host the 2010 FIFA World Cup. Commentators, and Mbeki himself, frequently linked the bid to his vision for an African renaissance. In 2015, amid an American investigation into corruption at FIFA, soccer administrator Chuck Blazer testified that, between 2004 and 2011, he and other FIFA executives had received bribes in connection with South Africa's bid. Mbeki denied any knowledge of the bribes.\nElectricity crisis.\nIn late 2007, Mbeki's government announced that the public power utility, Eskom, would introduce electricity rationing or rolling blackouts, commonly known in South Africa as loadshedding. In subsequent months, Mbeki publicly apologised, acknowledging that the government had failed to heed Eskom's warnings, offered regularly for several consecutive years, that infrastructure investments were required to avoid energy shortages \u2013 in his words, \"Eskom was right and government was wrong.\" However, some analysts suggested that insufficient investment was not the hindrance to electricity supply, and that other policy decisions by government and at Eskom, including the implementation of black economic empowerment criteria in coal procurement contracts, had contributed to the crisis. In his last State of the Nation address in February 2008, Mbeki repeated the apology and devoted nearly three pages of his speech to government's plans for addressing the energy crisis.\n2008 xenophobic attacks.\nIn May 2008, a series of riots took place in a number of South African townships, mainly in Gauteng province, when South African residents violently attacked migrants from other African countries. At least 62 people were killed, several hundred injured, and many thousand displaced. To contain the violence, Mbeki deployed the army to affected areas \u2013 the first such deployment to a civilian area since the end of apartheid. In a televised address towards the end of the saga, Mbeki called the attacks \"an absolute disgrace\", saying, \"Never since the birth of our democracy have we witnessed such callousness.\"\nSome commentators argued that Mbeki's government had failed to acknowledge or sufficiently to address growing xenophobia in South Africa in the years preceding the attacks. Indeed, the AU's African Peer Review Mechanism had reported in 2006 that xenophobia was an urgent concern in South Africa. These criticisms were often linked to criticisms of Mbeki's policy in Zimbabwe, because a large proportion of South Africa's growing foreign-born population were Zimbabwean refugees. Moreover, when Mbeki argued that the attacks had other motives, both economic and \"criminal\", some critics accused him of \"xenophobia denialism\" and of refusing to acknowledge the genuine xenophobic sentiment in parts of the population.\nSuccession.\nPolokwane conference.\nIn June 2005, Mbeki removed Zuma from his post as national deputy president, after Zuma's associate Schabir Shaik was convicted of making corrupt payments to Zuma in relation to the 1999 Arms Deal. The National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) charged Zuma with corruption later that year. However, Zuma remained deputy president of the ANC, and in subsequent years, the rivalry between Zuma and Mbeki and their allies intensified, with Zuma supporters frequently alleging that the charges against Zuma were politically motivated.\nBy 2007, Zuma had emerged as an apparent contender in the ANC's next presidential elections, to be held at the party's 52nd National Conference in Polokwane, Limpopo. By April of that year, it was also clear that Mbeki intended to stand for a third term as ANC president. Mbeki's term as national president would expire in 2009, and he had said in 2006 that he had no intention of having the Constitution changed to permit him a third term in office, saying, \"By the end of 2009, I will have been in a senior position in government for 15 years. I think that's too long.\" However, the ANC lacked internal term limits, and some suspected that he intended to continue to exert substantial influence over the government through the ANC presidency.\nZuma drew substantial support from the left wing of the party, especially through the ANC Youth League and the ANC's partners in the Tripartite Alliance, the South African Communist Party and COSATU, with whom Mbeki's relationship was extremely poor. At the elective conference, on 18 December, Mbeki lost the presidential election to Zuma, gaining less than 40% of the vote. According to ANC tradition, as ANC president Zuma would become the party's presidential candidate in the 2009 general election, and therefore, given the ANC's substantial electoral majority, was overwhelmingly likely to succeed Mbeki as national president in 2009.\nHigh court finding and appeal.\nOn 12 September 2008, Pietermaritzburg High Court judge Chris Nicholson set aside the corruption charges against Zuma. He found that the charges were unlawful on the procedural grounds that the NPA had not given Zuma adequate opportunity to make representations. Nicholson also lent his support to allegations that Zuma's charges had been politically motivated, saying that he was \"not convinced that [Zuma] was incorrect when he averred political meddling in his prosecution\" and that the case seemed to be part of \"some great political contest or game.\" Mbeki later applied to the Constitutional Court to appeal the judgement, calling Nicholson's findings about political interference \"vexatious, scandalous and prejudicial.\" The NPA also appealed, and in January 2009 the Supreme Court of Appeal found in its favour and overturned Nicholson's ruling. Partially redeeming Mbeki, the appellate court said that Nicholson's allegations of political interference had been irrelevant to Nicholson's decision and had apparently derived from Nicholson's \"own conspiracy theory.\"\nResignation.\nHowever, shortly after Nicholson delivered his judgement and months before the appeal was heard, the Zuma-aligned ANC National Executive Committee, as elected at the Polokwane conference, \"recalled\" Mbeki, asking him to resign as national president. The National Executive Committee is a party political body and therefore lacked the constitutional authority to remove Mbeki directly, but the ANC-controlled Parliament could have effected his removal had he not acquiesced voluntarily. On 20 September 2008, a spokesman announced that Mbeki would resign. In court papers filed later that week, Mbeki said that it was Nicholson's findings which had \"led to my being recalled by my political party, the ANC \u2013 a request I have acceded to as a committed and loyal member of the ANC for the past 52 years.\"\nIn the aftermath of his announcement, at least 11 cabinet ministers and three deputy ministers \u2013 including Deputy President Mlambo-Ngcuka and Minister of Finance Trevor Manuel \u2013 announced that they would also resign. Mbeki's resignation took effect on 25 September, and he was replaced as national president by Kgalema Motlanthe, who had been elected ANC deputy president at the Polokwane conference.\nPost-presidency.\nParty politics.\nAfter his resignation from the presidency, Mbeki retained his ANC membership but retreated from party politics. In the meantime, the Congress of the People (Cope) was founded as a breakaway party, composed largely of former ANC members known to be Mbeki loyalists. There were rumours that Mbeki was involved in Cope and would perhaps defect to it, especially after his mother Epainette, widow of ANC stalwart Govan, began attending Cope election rallies in the family's native Eastern Cape. According to political analyst Susan Booysen, although Mbeki \"would never emerge from the silent, invisible wings onto centre stage... the whole Cope plot carried the 'Mbeki' stamp.\"\nMbeki began again to appear at ANC events and to comment on ANC politics from around 2011. Although he has since said that he continued to vote for the ANC in the interim, he did not campaign on its behalf at any time during the Zuma presidency, which lasted between 2009 and 2018. In more recent years, he has been fairly vocal in reflecting publicly about perceived problems in the ANC and its leadership and about the country's economic problems and policies.\nInternational mediation.\nMotlanthe asked Mbeki to remain in his role as mediator in Zimbabwe after his resignation in 2008, and he later returned to Zimbabwe, in 2020, to mediate a further political dispute. He also continued to chair the long-serving AU High-level Implementation Panel for Sudan and South Sudan, which in 2016 brokered an agreement between warring Sudanese parties to begin peace negotiations. Although he remained critical of the UN's interventions in Africa, he also chaired the UN Economic Commission for Africa High-Level Panel on Illicit Financial Flows from Africa, which was established in collaboration with the AU in 2011.\nPhilanthropy.\nThe Thabo Mbeki Foundation was launched on 10 October 2010, ahead of a three-day conference. Its mission centres around Mbeki's trademark \"African renaissance\", and the objective of promoting Africa's political, social, economic, and cultural development. It was launched in tandem with the Thabo Mbeki African Leadership Institute, which aims to train leaders capable of contributing to the foundation's objectives.\nPersonality and public image.\nMbeki has sometimes been characterised as remote and academic, although in his second campaign for the Presidency in 2004, many observers described him as finally relaxing into more traditional ways of campaigning, sometimes dancing at events and even kissing babies. Mbeki used his weekly column in the ANC newsletter \"ANC Today\", to produce discussions on a variety of topics. He sometimes used his column to deliver pointed invective against political opponents, and at other times used it as a kind of professor of political theory, educating ANC cadres on the intellectual justifications for African National Congress policy. Although these columns were remarkable for their dense prose, they often were used to influence news. Although Mbeki did not generally make a point of befriending or courting reporters, his columns and news events often yielded good results for his administration by ensuring that his message is a primary driving force of news coverage. Indeed, in initiating his columns, Mbeki stated his view that the bulk of South African media sources did not speak for or to the South African majority, and stated his intent to use \"ANC Today\" to speak directly to his constituents rather than through the media.\nMbeki appears to have been at ease with the Internet and willing to quote from it. For instance, in a column discussing Hurricane Katrina, he cited Wikipedia, quoted at length a discussion of Katrina's lessons on American inequality from the Native American publication \"Indian Country Today\", and then included excerpts from a David Brooks column in \"The New York Times\" in a discussion of why the events of Katrina illustrated the necessity for global development and redistribution of wealth.\nHis penchant for quoting diverse and sometimes obscure sources, both from the Internet and from a wide variety of books, made his column an interesting parallel to political blogs although the ANC does not describe it in these terms. His views on AIDS were supported by Internet searching which led him to so-called \"AIDS denialist\" websites; in this case, Mbeki's use of the Internet was roundly criticised and even ridiculed by opponents.\nControversies.\n1999 Arms Deal.\nThere have been rumours and allegations, never proven or prosecuted and denied by Mbeki, that Mbeki was involved in or aware of corruption in the 1999 Arms Deal, a major defence procurement package negotiated while he was deputy president.\nCrime.\nIn 2004 President Thabo Mbeki made an attack on commentators who argued that violent crime was out of control in South Africa, calling them white racists who want the country to fail. He alleged that crime was falling and some journalists were distorting reality by depicting black people as \"barbaric savages\" who liked to rape and kill. Annual statistics published in September 2004 showed that most categories of crime were down, but some had challenged the figures' credibility and said that South Africa remained extremely dangerous, especially for women. In a column for the African National Congress website, the president rebuked the doubters. Mr Mbeki did not name journalist Charlene Smith who had championed victims of sexual violence since writing about her own rape, but quoted a recent article in which she said South Africa had the highest rate of rape and referred (apparently sarcastically) to her as an \"internationally recognised expert on sexual violence\". He said: \"She was saying our cultures, traditions and religions as Africans inherently make every African man a potential rapist ... [a] view which defines the African people as barbaric savages.\" Mr Mbeki also described the newspaper \"The Citizen\", and other commentators who challenged the apparent fall in crime, as pessimists who did not trust black rule.\nIn January 2007, the African Peer Review Mechanism (APRM) \"draft\" report on South Africa was released. This noted that South Africa had the world's second-highest murder rate, with about 50 people a day being killed, and that although serious crime was reported as falling, security analysts said that the use of violence in robberies, and rape, were more common. Mbeki in response said in an interview that fears of crime were exaggerated.\nIn December 2007 the final African Peer Review Mechanism (APRM) report on South Africa, again suggested that there was an unacceptably high level of violent crime in the country. President Mbeki said the suggestion of unacceptably high violent crime appeared to be an acceptance by the panel of what he called \"a populist view\". He challenged some of the statistics on crime, which he noted may have resulted from a weak information base, leading to wrong conclusions. Although rape statistics had been obtained from the South African Police Service, \"this only denotes the incidents of rape that were reported, some of which could have resulted in acquittals\" Mbeki indicated.\nDebate with Archbishop Tutu.\nIn 2004 the Archbishop Emeritus of Cape Town, Desmond Tutu, criticised President Mbeki for surrounding himself with \"yes-men\", not doing enough to improve the position of the poor and for promoting economic policies that only benefited a small black elite. He also accused Mbeki and the ANC of suppressing public debate. Mbeki responded that Tutu had never been an ANC member and defended the debates that took place within ANC branches and other public forums. He also asserted his belief in the value of democratic discussion by quoting the Chinese slogan \"let a hundred flowers bloom\", referring to the brief Hundred Flowers Campaign within the Chinese Communist Party in 1956\u201357.\nThe \"ANC Today\" newsletter featured several analyses of the debate, written by Mbeki and the ANC. The latter suggested that Tutu was an \"icon\" of \"white elites\", thereby suggesting that his political importance was overblown by the media; and while the article took pains to say that Tutu had not sought this status, it was described in the press as a particularly pointed and personal critique of Tutu. Tutu responded that he would pray for Mbeki as he had prayed for the officials of the apartheid government.\nPolitical commentary post-presidency.\nOn 10 October 2024, Mbeki wrote a letter to Mr Matome Chiloane, Member of the Executive for the Gauteng Education Department (GED), criticizing the GED's handling of an incident of alleged racism at Pretoria High School for Girls. The letter was copied to the Gauteng Premier, Mr Phanyaza Lesufi. The GED had been criticized in the South African media for claiming that there was racism at Pretoria High School for Girls without proof of such.\nPersonal life and family.\nIn October 1959, Mbeki had a son, Monwabisi Kwanda, with Olive Mpahlwa, a childhood friend which whom he had struck up a romance while at Lovedale. Kwanda was raised by his mother and later by Mbeki's mother, Epainette.' He was last seen by his family in 1981 and is presumed to have died in exile, but the circumstances of his death remain unknown. Olive testified about his disappearance at the Truth and Reconciliation Commission in 1996, making an impassioned plea for those with information to step forward.'\nMbeki's youngest brother, Jama, also disappeared in exile. He had spent his adolescence in Lesotho and was an activist in the Basutoland Congress Party (BCP) and its Lesotho Liberation Army. BCP was much closer to the PAC than to the ANC, and later became an avowed enemy of the latter. Jama disappeared in March 1982, after he skipped bail.' According to an investigation commissioned by his family in the early 1990s, he was informed upon by a comrade, entrapped by security police, and killed on the side of a highway later in 1982.' Mbeki's only living sibling, Moeletsi, was also educated abroad and is now a prominent economist. He often publicly criticised the policies of his brother's government.\nMbeki married Zanele Dlamini Mbeki in 1974, a social worker from Alexandra whom he met in London before his departure for Moscow. The wedding ceremony was held on 23 November at Farnham Castle in Surrey, England. Adelaide Tambo and Mendi Msimang stood \"in loco parentis\" for Mbeki, and Essop Pahad was his best man. They have no children together.\nRecognition.\nHonorary degrees.\nMbeki has received many honorary degrees from South African and foreign universities. Mbeki received an honorary doctorate in business administration from the Arthur D Little Institute, Boston, in 1994. In 1995, he received honorary doctorate from the University of South Africa and an honorary doctorate of laws from Sussex University. Mbeki was awarded an honorary doctorate from Rand Afrikaans University in 1999. In 2000 he was awarded an honorary doctorate of laws from Glasgow Caledonian University. In 2004, he was awarded an honorary doctorate in commercial sciences by the University of Stellenbosch.\nOrders and decorations.\nDuring Mbeki's official visit to Britain in 2001, he was made an honorary Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath (GCB). The Mayor of Athens, Dora Bakoyannis, awarded Mbeki with the City of Athens Medal of Honour in 2005. During Mbeki's official visit to Sudan in 2005, he was awarded Sudan's Insignia of Honour in recognition of his role in resolving conflicts and working for development in the Continent. In 2007, Mbeki was made a Knight of the Most Venerable Order of the Hospital of Saint John of Jerusalem at St George's Cathedral in Cape Town by the current grand prior, Prince Richard, Duke of Gloucester.\nAwards.\nMbeki was awarded the Good Governance Award in 1997 by the US-based Corporate Council on Africa. He received the Newsmaker of the year award from Pretoria News Press Association in 2000 and repeated the honour in 2008, this time under the auspices of media research company Monitoring South Africa. In honour of his commitment to democracy in the new South Africa, Mbeki was awarded the Oliver Tambo/Johnny Makatini Freedom Award in 2000. Mbeki was awarded the Peace and Reconciliation Award at the Gandhi Awards for Reconciliation in Durban in 2003. In 2004, Mbeki was awarded the Good Brother Award by Washington, D.C.'s National Congress of Black Women for his commitment to gender equality and the emancipation of women in South Africa. In 2005, he was also awarded the Champion of the Earth Award by the United Nations. During the European-wide Action Week Against Racism in 2005, Mbeki was awarded the Rotterdamse Jongeren Raad (RJR) Antidiscrimination Award by the Netherlands. In 2006, he was awarded the Presidential Award for his outstanding service to economic growth and investor confidence in South Africa and Africa and for his role in the international arena by the South African Chambers of Commerce and Industry.

It was edited and produced by Mary Sweeney, Lynch's longtime filmmaking partner and collaborator, who also co-wrote the script with John E. Roach. It is based on the true story of Alvin Straight's 1994 journey across Iowa and Wisconsin on a lawn mower. It is Lynch's second and last family-friendly, accessible and mainstream feature after \"The Elephant Man\" (1980), as largely contrasted with Lynch's own surrealist and violent films.\nAlvin (Richard Farnsworth) is an elderly World War II veteran who lives with his daughter. When he hears that his estranged brother has suffered a stroke, Alvin makes up his mind to visit him and hopefully make amends before he dies. Because Alvin's legs and eyes are too impaired for him to hold a driver's license, he hitches a trailer to a thirty-year-old lawn tractor, which has a maximum speed of , and sets off on the 240-mile (390\u00a0km) journey from Laurens, Iowa, to Mount Zion, Wisconsin.\n\"The Straight Story\" was released by Walt Disney Pictures in the United States and select international territories. The film grossed $6.2 million in a limited theatrical release in the United States and sold 516,597 tickets nationwide during France's theatrical release. The film was a critical success; reviewers praised the intensity of the character performances, particularly the realistic dialogue which film critic Roger Ebert compared to the works of Ernest Hemingway. It received a nomination for the Palme d'Or at the 1999 Cannes Film Festival and Farnsworth received a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actor, becoming the oldest nominee in the category at the time. \nPlot.\nIn Laurens, Iowa, elderly Alvin Straight is found lying on his kitchen floor after a fall. His daughter, Rose, takes him to see a doctor, who admonishes him to give up tobacco, improve his diet, and use a walker, all of which he rejects. When Alvin's brother, Lyle, suffers a stroke, Alvin decides to visit Lyle, even though they have not spoken in ten years.\nLyle lives in Mount Zion, Wisconsin, 240 miles away. As neither Alvin (due to his age) nor Rose (due to an unspecified disability) has a driver's license, Alvin decides to make the trip on his riding mower. His plan surprises his family, friends, and neighbors. The mower soon breaks down, forcing Alvin to accept a ride from a passing tour bus and call for help. However, he is determined to continue the trip, and buys a used 1966 John Deere 110 lawn tractor to continue his journey.\nAlvin meets a variety of people on the road. He shares his dinner with a young girl hitchhiker, who ran away from home out of fear that her family would be upset with her pregnancy. Alvin reflects about the importance of family, comparing it to a bundle of sticks that is hard to break compared to a single stick. The next day, she leaves him a bundle of sticks tied together as a thank-you. Several passing RAGBRAI cyclists are amused to see him on the highway and welcome him to their campsite. He speaks with some of the cyclists about growing old. He also meets a distraught woman who hit a deer during her commute and tearfully rants about how she keeps on hitting deer despite her prayers. Alvin respectfully cooks and eats the deer.\nAlvin's tractor begins to fail, throwing his journey into jeopardy. His transmission fails as he travels down a steep hill, but he manages to stop. Danny, a local, invites Alvin to camp in his backyard until the tractor is repaired. He offers to drive Alvin to Mount Zion, but Alvin declines, preferring to travel his own way. \nRunning low on cash, Alvin calls Rose to send him his Social Security check. Two bickering mechanics overcharge him for fixing his tractor, but he cannily bargains the price down. A fellow veteran invites Alvin for a drink, and they exchange traumatic stories about their experiences in World War II. Alvin, a sniper during the war, declines a beer but confesses that he is still haunted by killing an American in a friendly fire incident and says that he became an alcoholic when he got back home, but he is now sober.\nAfter crossing into Wisconsin, Alvin chats with a Catholic priest who knows of Lyle and his stroke. The priest says that Lyle never mentioned a brother. Alvin admits that he wants to make amends. Although the exact cause of the estrangement is never stated, only that being the one to make the effort is hard on him, Alvin says alcohol was involved.\nAlvin finally arrives in Mount Zion. To steel himself, he drinks his first beer in years. Tractor trouble stops him just short of Lyle's dilapidated cabin, but he persists. Lyle invites Alvin to sit together on the porch, without recrimination or bitterness. He asks if Alvin rode the tractor all the way just to see him. Alvin quietly confirms this, and Lyle's eyes well up with tears. The two men sit together silently and gaze up at the stars.\nProduction.\nDevelopment.\nIn 1994, 73-year-old Alvin Straight rode a lawnmower across roughly 250 miles of the American Midwest to visit his ailing brother. Mary Sweeney, David Lynch's frequent collaborator, read about Straight's story in \"The New York Times\" that summer. Said Sweeney, \"Growing up in Wisconsin, I easily connected with that kind of stoic, non-verbal, stubborn, idiosyncratic American character. I get how hard it is to have quiet pride and dignity when you're old and poor and are living in the middle of nowhere. I understand what these people's dreams and frustrations are. And I loved how much his journey captured the national imagination, so, wearing my producer's hat, I started trying to secure the rights.\"\nProducer Ray Stark had already acquired the rights to Straight's story and envisioned the project as a potential star vehicle for Paul Newman. Straight died in 1996, and the rights to his story became available again. Sweeney co-wrote the script with John Roach, a childhood friend; the two retraced Straight's route in the process of writing. When Lynch saw the finished script he immediately took to it, saying \"it became, for me, very real.\"\nCasting.\nFor the role of Alvin Straight, producers cast their first choice, Richard Farnsworth. Though he was reluctant to commit to the role as he was then terminally ill with metastatic prostate cancer, he took the role out of admiration for Straight. Sissy Spacek, a longtime friend of Lynch's who had helped to finance his earlier film \"Eraserhead\", was cast as Alvin's daughter, Rose. Harry Dean Stanton was cast as Alvin's ailing brother.\nFilming.\n\"The Straight Story\" was independently shot along the actual route taken by Straight, and all scenes were shot in chronological order in the autumn of 1998. Alvin Straight's real-life residence was used as his home in the film and Straight's neighbors in the film were his actual neighbors. Lynch would later call the film \"my most experimental movie\".\nDuring production, Farnsworth's cancer had spread to his bones, but he astonished his co-workers with his tenacity during production. The paralysis of his legs as shown in the film was real. Farnsworth died by suicide on October 6, 2000, at the age of 80.\nAfter a successful debut at Cannes, Buena Vista Pictures Distribution acquired distribution rights to the film in the United States, Australia and Scandivanian territories, where it would be released under the Walt Disney Pictures banner, while Le Studio Canal+ and Les Films Alain Sarde would share international sales. It was Peter Schneider, Disney's president of production at the time, that got the idea to have the studio acquire the film after seeing it at Cannes, calling it \"a beautiful movie about values, forgiveness and healing and celebrates America. As soon as I saw it, I knew it was a Walt Disney film.\" October Films also negotiated for the rights, but a deal never materialized. The film was given a G rating by the MPAA (the only Lynch film to receive such a rating).\nMusic.\nThe musical score for \"The Straight Story\" was composed by Angelo Badalamenti, continuing a 13-plus year collaboration with Lynch that began with \"Blue Velvet\". A soundtrack album was released on October 12, 1999, by Windham Hill Records.\nSoundtrack.\nAll music composed and conducted by Angelo Badalamenti.\nHome media.\n\"The Straight Story\" was released on DVD on November 7, 2000 by Buena Vista Home Entertainment (under the Walt Disney Home Video label). There are no chapter markers on the original North American DVD release, with a note written by Lynch inside the DVD case that reads, \"It is my opinion that a film is not a book \u2013 it should not be broken up. It is a continuum and should be seen as such.\" On April 3, 2020, the film became available to stream on Disney+.\nOn September 17, 2021, \"The Straight Story\" received a limited edition Blu-ray release from Imprint Films.\nReception.\nCritical reception.\n\"The Straight Story\" was critically acclaimed upon its release, with critics lauding Lynch's uncharacteristic subject matter. \"Entertainment Weekly\" described the film as a \"celestial piece of Americana\". The \"Chicago Tribune\" wrote of the film, \"we see something American studio movies usually don't give us: the simple, unsentimentalized beauty of the rural American Midwestern landscape.\"\nJanet Maslin of \"The New York Times\" wrote, \"the same bellwether quality that left \"Blue Velvet\" looking so prescient, and ushered in a whole cinematic wave of taboo-shattering, is at work once again. When a born unnaturalist like Lynch can bring such interest and emotion to one man's simple story, the realm of the ordinary starts looking like a new frontier.\" Of Farnsworth's performance, Maslin wrote, \"he automatically frees the film from any sense of artifice and delivers an amazingly stalwart performance that will not soon be forgotten.\" Her review concluded, \"\"The Straight Story\" is...about gazing at the sky, about experiencing each encounter to the fullest, than it is about getting anywhere in a hurry. It's been too long since a great American movie dared to regard life that way.\"\nRoger Ebert gave the film four out of four stars, the first positive review he had given to a film by Lynch. He wrote: \"The first time I saw \"The Straight Story\" I focused on the foreground and liked it. The second time I focused on the background, too, and loved it. The movie isn't just about the old Alvin Straight's odyssey through the sleepy towns and rural districts of the Midwest, but about the people he finds to listen and care for him.\"\nOn review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 95% based on 106 reviews, with an average rating of 8.2/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \"With strong performances and director David Lynch at the helm, \"The Straight Story\" steers past sentimental byways on its ambling journey across the American heartland.\" On Metacritic, the film has a score of 86 out of 100, based on 32 critics, indicating \"universal acclaim\". \nAccolades.\n\"The Straight Story\" was nominated for the Palme d'Or at the 1999 Cannes Film Festival. Richard Farnsworth earned an Academy Award nomination for Best Actor for his portrayal of Alvin Straight. For 21 years he held the record as the oldest person (at 79) to be nominated for a Best Actor Oscar. Farnsworth also won the 1999 New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Actor for his performance in the film.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Born as Georgy Vasilievich Govorov, he became a monk in 1841, taking the name Theophan.\nHe is best known through the books and letters he wrote concerning spiritual life, especially on the subjects of the Christian life and the training of youth in the faith. He also played an important role in translating the \"Philokalia\" from Church Slavonic into Russian. The \"Philokalia\" is a classic of Orthodox spirituality, composed of the collected works of a number of Church Fathers which were edited and placed in a four volume set in the 17th and 18th centuries. In his works, a persistent theme was developing an interior life of continuous prayer and learning to \"pray without ceasing\" as St. Paul teaches in his first letter to the Thessalonians.\nEarly life.\nHe was born on January 10, 1815, as Georgy Vasilievich Govorov (), in the village of Chernavsk, in the Oryol Governorate of the Russian Empire. His father was a Russian Orthodox priest.\nIn 1823, he was sent to study at the Theological College in Livny. The moral and spiritual beliefs in the school was favorable to him. In 1829, Govorov was found among the best students and was transferred to the Oryol Theological Seminary. At the time, Archimandrite Isidore (Nikolsky) was the rector of the seminary, the philosophical sciences were taught by Evfimy Ostromyslensky and the literature teacher was Hieromonk Platon (Gorodetsky), later Metropolitan of Kiev and Galicia. He found success in his studies, and he began to consciously work on himself. Already at this time, his characteristic feature was a love of seclusion. The seminary bulletin noted that Govorov was distinguished by \"a penchant for solitude; edifying in his treatment of comrades; sets an example of diligence and good morals; meek and silent.\" After graduating from the seminary, considered the best of the pupils of his course, he was sent to the Kiev Theological Academy in 1837.\nCareer.\nDuring his studies in Kiev, in 1838, his mother died, and a year later, his father died as well, influencing Govorov's life. On October 1, 1840, he submitted a petition to the academic authorities for monastic tonsure; at the age of 26, he received monastic tonsure from the rector of the Kiev Theological Academy, Archimandrite Jeremiah Solovyov with the name Theophanes in honor of Theophanes the Confessor. On April 6 of the same year, on the day of his episcopal consecration, Jeremiah ordained him to the office of hierodeacon, and also to the office of hieromonk on July 1 of the same year.\nIn 1841, Hieromonk Theophan was among the first to graduate from the Academy with a master's degree in theology for a course essay \"Review of Sublaw Religion\" (\u041e\u0431\u043e\u0437\u0440\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u0434\u0437\u0430\u043a\u043e\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u0440\u0435\u043b\u0438\u0433\u0438\u0438), which, being found among the best works, was sent to the Most Holy Synod. Metropolitan Philaret Drozdov of Moscow, a permanent member of the Most Holy Synod, stated in his review: \"This work contains so much information and considerations about the law of Moses that they serve as sufficient evidence of the knowledge of the writer, giving him the right to a master's degree.\" Immediately after graduating from the Academy, Theophan was appointed rector of the Kiev-Sofia Theological College, where he began to teach Latin.\nOn December 7, 1842, he was appointed an inspector and teacher of psychology and logic at the Novgorod Theological Seminary. He received the degree of Master of Divinity on December 18 of the same year.\nOn October 16, 1844, he was appointed teacher of the Saint Petersburg Theological Academy in the Department of Moral and Pastoral Theology and Hieromonk Theophan became an assistant inspector of the Academy from March 22, 1845. On July 3, 1845, he was appointed as a member of the committee to review the summaries of academic subjects taught at the seminary.\nAt this time, he was interested a solitary monastic life; in a letter to his spiritual father Jeremiah, who tonsured and ordained him, he wrote: \"I am beginning to be burdened by my academic position to the point of unbearability. I would like to go to church, and sit there\". On August 21, 1847, at his request, he was appointed as a member of the Russian Orthodox Ecclesiastical Mission in Jerusalem, headed by Archimandrite Porphyrius (Uspensky). In Jerusalem. Theophan learned iconography and studied Greek, French, Hebrew and Arabic. In Palestine, he became acquainted with the ancient asceticism of the Eastern monasteries and the monuments of ascetic writing of the past centuries. He also engaged in the translation of the works of the holy fathers of the Philokalia. In addition, he became intimately acquainted with the non-Orthodox Christian beliefs. For his works, on May 5, 1851, Theophan was awarded the gold pectoral cross.\nIn 1853, the Crimean War began; on May 3, 1854, the mission was withdrawn to Russia. The return took place through Western Europe; Theophan visited many cities, churches, museums, libraries, and educational institutions. Notably, Archimandrite Porphyrius and Hieromonk Theophan had an audience with Pope Pius IX.\nUpon his return to Russia, he was appointed a teacher of canon law at the Saint Petersburg Theological Academy; on April 14, 1855, he was elevated to the rank of Archimandrite. In September of the same year, he was appointed rector of the Olonets Theological Seminary, which was located in the building of the Petrozavodsk Theological College; Archimandrite Theophan had to organize the construction of his own building for the seminary. At this time he wrote the following: \"We don't have a seminary. By right of the strong, we live in a building bought for a school, and it is in an apartment. The seminary bursa is also in the apartment, which is very, very inconvenient\". In October 1855, he was appointed a member of the Olonets Ecclesiastical Consistory. At the suggestion of Archbishop Arcadius (Fyodorov), he was appointed censor of the sermons of the Olonets diocese. At the seminary, he organized an anti-schismatic library.\nOn May 21, 1856, he was appointed rector of the Russian embassy church in Constantinople (Ottoman Empire), as he was well acquainted with the Orthodox East. Theophan was charged with collecting information about the Greco-Bulgarian Schism that was brewing at that time. For his labors, on April 17, 1857, he was awarded the 2nd degree of the Order of St. Anna.\nIn May 1857, he was appointed rector of the Saint Petersburg Theological Academy. In addition to the rector's office, he was entrusted with overseeing the teaching of the Law of God in secular educational institutions of the St. Petersburg district. He was chairman of the committee at the Academy of Sciences for the publication of works of Byzantine historians; in 1858, he became a chairman of the committee for the translation of Holy Scripture into Russian.\nOn May 29, 1859, Archimandrite Theophan was elected Bishop of Tambov and Shatsk, and on June 1, in the Trinity Cathedral of the Alexander Nevsky Lavra, he was consecrated bishop. On July 5, he took over the diocese. The Tambov diocese was one of the most extensive and popular; there were 1,172 priests, 681 deacons, several hundred monastics, and many sectarians and Old Believers among the population. Bishop Theophan paid special attention to preaching; he accompanied almost every service with a sermon. Bishop Theophan and the clergy were convinced, as they stated, \"that preaching is his first, direct and sacred duty, and at the same time should be an internal need, if only to properly and consciously treat his high ministry\". The Tambov male monastery of Our Lady of Kazan at the bishop's house became the center of preaching. In the Tambov Diocesan Gazette, Bishop Theophan published his homiletic treatise \"How to compose a sermon\", in which he stated the features of the sermon: \"the peculiarity of my sermons is that they are not composed [\u2026] These are written impromptu.\"\nOn July 22, 1863, Bishop Theophan was moved to the ancient Vladimir diocese. At the Diocese of Vladimir, where at the time there were many schismatics and sectarians, Theophan's fame as a preacher strengthened. He authored \"Instruction for Preaching the Word of God\", published on November 27, 1864 in the Vladimir Diocesan Gazette. In the same year he sent Hieromonk Moses to Moscow to verify old printed books. In Vyazniki county he opened the \"Epiphany Orthodox Brotherhood\". In 1865, a women's diocesan school was opened under his care. For his archpastoral activity, on April 19, 1864, he was awarded the 1st degree of Order of St. Anna.\nIn retirement.\nThe petition for his retirement was granted on June 17, 1866, with his appointment as rector in the Vysha Hermitage in the Tambov Governorate. On September 19, at his request, he was dismissed from the management of the monastery. While living in Vysha, he spent his time reading and writing.\nHe suffered from rheumatism, neuralgia, cardiac arrhythmia and dizziness, as well as progressive cataracts, as a result of which he became blind in his right eye in 1888.\nDeath.\nTheophan the Recluse died on January 6, 1894. He was buried in the Kazan church of the Vysha Monastery.\n\"The Spiritual Life and How to Be Attuned To It\".\n\"The Spiritual Life and How to Be Attuned To It\" was originally written in response to Theophan's encounter with a young woman. While at a ball, a Moscow woman began having thoughts she believed irrational about the meaning of life and the mortality of humans. After contacting Theophan, the two began corresponding through letters, the lady writing on her spiritual difficulties and Theophan responding with spiritual advice. She later became a nun. The Saint Herman Press, the publisher of the illustrated edition of \"The Spiritual Life and How to Be Attuned to It\", notes that it was of great importance to Theophan that the young woman should \"be able to keenly hear the right 'tone' of spiritual life\".\nVeneration as a saint.\nTheophan was canonized by the Local Council of the Russian Orthodox Church of 1988. The act of canonization declared that his \"deep theological understanding of the Christian teaching, as well as its performance in practice, and, as a consequence of this, the loftiness and holiness of the life of the \"sviatitel\"' allow for his writings to be regarded as a development of the teaching of the Holy Fathers, preserving the same Orthodox purity and Divine enlightenment.\" His feast day is celebrated January 6 or January 10.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "31353", "revid": "211905", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31353", "title": "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy", "text": "Science fiction series\nThe Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is a comedy science fiction franchise created by Douglas Adams. Originally a radio sitcom broadcast over two series on BBC Radio 4 between 1978 and 1980, it was soon adapted to other formats, including both novels and comic books; a 1981 BBC television series; a 1984 text adventure game; stage shows; and a 2005 feature film.\n\"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\" is an international multimedia phenomenon; the novels are the most widely distributed, having been translated into more than 30 languages by 2005. The first novel, \"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\" (1979), has been ranked fourth on the BBC's The Big Read poll. The sixth novel, \"And Another Thing...\", was written by Eoin Colfer with additional unpublished material by Douglas Adams. In 2017, BBC Radio 4 announced a 40th-anniversary celebration with Dirk Maggs, one of the original producers, in charge. The first of six new episodes was broadcast on 8 March 2018.\nThe broad narrative of \"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\" follows the misadventures of the last surviving Earth man, Arthur Dent, following the demolition of the Earth to make way for a hyperspace bypass. Dent is rescued from Earth's destruction by Ford Prefect\u2014a human-like alien writer for the electronic travel guide \"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\"\u2014by hitchhiking onto a passing Vogon spacecraft. Following his rescue, Dent explores the galaxy with Prefect and encounters Trillian, another human who was taken from Earth (before its destruction) by the President of the Galaxy, Zaphod Beeblebrox, and Marvin the Paranoid Android. Certain narrative details were changed among the various adaptations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSpelling.\nThe different versions of the series spell the title differently\u2014thus \"Hitch-Hiker's Guide\", \"Hitch Hiker's Guide\", and \"Hitchhiker's Guide\" are used in different editions (UK or US), formats (audio or print), and compilations of the book, with some omitting the apostrophe. Some editions use different spellings on the spine and title page. The h2g2's \"English Usage in Approved Entries\" claims that \"Hitchhiker's Guide\" is the spelling that Adams preferred. At least two reference works make note of the inconsistency in the titles. Both, however, repeat the statement that Adams decided in 2000 that \"everyone should spell it the same way [one word, no hyphen] from then on.\"\nSynopsis.\nThe various versions follow the same basic plot but they are in many places mutually contradictory, as Adams rewrote the story substantially for each new adaptation. Throughout all versions, the series follows the adventures of Arthur Dent, a hapless Englishman, following the destruction of the Earth by the Vogons (a race of unpleasant and bureaucratic aliens) to make way for a hyperspace bypass. Dent's adventures intersect with several other characters: Ford Prefect (an alien and researcher for the eponymous guidebook who rescues Dent from Earth's destruction), Zaphod Beeblebrox (Ford's eccentric semi-cousin and the Galactic President who has stolen the \"Heart of Gold,\" a spacecraft equipped with Infinite Improbability Drive), the depressed robot Marvin the Paranoid Android, and Trillian (formerly known as Tricia McMillan) who is a woman Arthur once met at a party in Islington and who\u2014thanks to Beeblebrox's intervention\u2014is the only other human survivor of Earth's destruction.\nIn their travels, Arthur comes to learn that the Earth was actually a giant supercomputer, created by another supercomputer, Deep Thought. Deep Thought had been built by its creators to give the answer to the \"Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything\", which, after eons of calculations, was given simply as \"42\". Deep Thought was then instructed to design the Earth supercomputer to determine what the Question actually is. The Earth was subsequently destroyed by the Vogons moments after its calculations were completed but before they could be communicated, and Arthur becomes the target of the descendants of the Deep Thought creators, believing his mind must hold the Question. With his friends' help, Arthur escapes and they decide to have lunch at The Restaurant at the End of the Universe, before embarking on further adventures.\nBackground.\nThe original, first radio series comes from a proposal called \"The Ends of the Earth\": six self-contained episodes, all ending with Earth being destroyed in a different way. While writing the first episode, Adams realised that he needed someone on the planet who was an alien to provide some context, and that this alien needed a reason to be there. Adams finally settled on making the alien a roving researcher for a \"wholly remarkable book\" named \"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\". As the first radio episode's writing progressed, the \"Guide\" became the centre of his story, and he decided to focus the series on it, with the destruction of Earth being the only hold-over.\nAdams claimed that the title came from a 1971 incident while he was hitchhiking around Europe as a young man with a copy of the \"Hitch-hiker's Guide to Europe\" book: while lying drunk in a field near Innsbruck with a copy of the book and looking up at the stars, he thought it would be a good idea for someone to write a hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy as well. However, he later claimed that he reassembled the memory from telling so many times and lost the original impression to old age. His friends are quoted as saying that Adams mentioned the idea of \"hitch-hiking around the galaxy\" to them while on holiday in Greece in 1973.\nAdams's fictional \"Guide\" is an electronic guidebook to the entire universe, originally published by Megadodo Publications, one of the great publishing houses of Ursa Minor Beta. The narrative of the various versions of the story is frequently punctuated with excerpts from the \"Guide\". The voice of the \"Guide\" (Peter Jones in the first two radio series and TV versions, later William Franklyn in the third, fourth and fifth radio series, and Stephen Fry in the movie version), also provides general narration.\nRadio.\nOriginal radio series.\nThe first radio series of six episodes (called \"Fits\" after the names of the sections of Lewis Carroll's nonsense poem \"The Hunting of the Snark\") was broadcast in 1978 on BBC Radio 4. Despite a low-key launch of the series (the first episode was broadcast at 10:30\u00a0pm on Wednesday, 8 March 1978), it received generally good reviews and a tremendous audience reaction for radio. A one-off episode (a \"Christmas special\") was broadcast later in the year. The BBC had a practice at the time of commissioning \"Christmas Special\" episodes for popular radio series, and while an early draft of this episode of \"The Hitchhiker's Guide\" had a Christmas-related plotline, it was decided to be \"in slightly poor taste\" and the episode as transmitted served as a bridge between the two series. This episode was released as part of the second radio series and, later, \"The Secondary Phase\" on cassettes and CDs. The Primary and Secondary Phases were aired, in a slightly edited version, in the United States on \"NPR Playhouse\".\nThe first series was repeated twice in 1978 alone and many more times in the next few years. This led to an LP re-recording, produced independently of the BBC for sale, and a further adaptation of the series as a book. A second radio series, which consisted of a further five episodes, and bringing the total number of episodes to 12, was broadcast in 1980.\nThe radio series (and the LP and TV versions) were narrated by comedy actor Peter Jones as The Book. Jones was cast after a three-month-long casting search and after at least three actors (including Michael Palin) turning down the role.\nThe series was also notable for its use of sound, being the first comedy series to be produced in stereo. Adams said that he wanted the programme's production to be comparable to that of a modern rock album. Much of the programme's budget was spent on sound effects, which were largely the work of Paddy Kingsland (for the pilot episode and the complete second series) at the BBC Radiophonic Workshop and Dick Mills and Harry Parker (for the remaining episodes (2\u20136) of the first series). The fact that they were at the forefront of modern radio production in 1978 and 1980 was reflected when the three new series of \"Hitchhiker's\" became some of the first radio shows to be mixed into four-channel Dolby Surround. This mix was also featured on DVD releases of the third radio series.\nThe theme tune used for the radio, television, LP, and film versions is \"Journey of the Sorcerer\", an instrumental piece composed by Bernie Leadon and recorded by the Eagles on their 1975 album \"One of These Nights\". Only the transmitted radio series used the original recording; a sound-alike cover by Tim Souster was used for the LP and TV series, another arrangement by Joby Talbot was used for the 2005 film, and still another arrangement, this time by Philip Pope, was recorded to be released with the CDs of the last three radio series. Apparently, Adams chose this song for its futuristic-sounding nature, but also for the fact that it had a banjo in it, which, as Geoffrey Perkins recalls, Adams said would give an \"on the road, hitch-hiking feel\" to it.\nThe twelve episodes were released (in a slightly edited form, removing the Pink Floyd music and two other tunes \"hummed\" by Marvin when the team land on Magrathea) on CD and cassette in 1988, becoming the first CD release in the BBC Radio Collection. They were re-released in 1992, and at this time Adams suggested that they could retitle Fits the First to Sixth as \"The Primary Phase\" and Fits the Seventh to Twelfth as \"The Secondary Phase\" instead of just \"the first series\" and \"the second series\". It was at about this time that a \"Tertiary Phase\" was first discussed with Dirk Maggs, adapting \"Life, the Universe and Everything\", but this series would not be recorded for another ten years.\nRadio series 3\u20135.\nOn 21 June 2004, the BBC announced in a press release that a new series of \"Hitchhiker's\" based on the third novel would be broadcast as part of its autumn schedule, produced by Above the Title Productions Ltd. The episodes were recorded in late 2003, but actual transmission was delayed while an agreement was reached with The Walt Disney Company over Internet re-broadcasts, as Disney had begun pre-production on the film. This was followed by news that further series would be produced based on the fourth and fifth novels.\nThe third series was broadcast in September and October 2004. The fourth and fifth were broadcast in May and June 2005, with the fifth series following immediately after the fourth. CD releases accompanied the transmission of the final episode in each series.\nThe adaptation of the third novel followed the book very closely, which caused major structural issues in meshing with the preceding radio series in comparison to the second novel. Because many events from the radio series were omitted from the second novel, and those that did occur happened in a different order, the two series split in completely different directions. The last two adaptations vary somewhat\u2014some events in \"Mostly Harmless\" are now foreshadowed in the adaptation of \"So Long and Thanks For All The Fish\", while both include some additional material that builds on incidents in the third series to tie all five (and their divergent plotlines) together, most especially including the character Zaphod more prominently in the final chapters and addressing his altered reality to include the events of the Secondary Phase. While \"Mostly Harmless\" originally contained a rather bleak ending, Dirk Maggs created a different ending for the transmitted radio version, ending it on a much more upbeat note, reuniting the cast one last time.\nThe core cast for the third to fifth radio series remained the same, except for the replacement of Peter Jones by William Franklyn as the Book, and Richard Vernon by Richard Griffiths as Slartibartfast, since both had died. (Homage to Jones' iconic portrayal of the Book was paid twice: the gradual shift of voices to a \"new\" version in episode 13, launching the new productions, and a blend of Jones and Franklyn's voices at the end of the final episode, the first part of Maggs' alternative ending.) Sandra Dickinson, who played Trillian in the TV series, here played Tricia McMillan, an English-born, American-accented alternate-universe version of Trillian, while David Dixon, the television series' Ford Prefect, made a cameo appearance as the \"Ecological Man\". Jane Horrocks appeared in the new semi-regular role of Fenchurch, Arthur's girlfriend, and Samantha B\u00e9art joined in the final series as Arthur and Trillian's daughter, Random Dent. Also reprising their roles from the original radio series were Jonathan Pryce as Zarniwoop (here blended with a character from the final novel to become Zarniwoop Vann Harl), Rula Lenska as Lintilla and her clones (and also as the Voice of the Bird), and Roy Hudd as Milliways compere Max Quordlepleen, as well as the original radio series' announcer, John Marsh.\nThe series also featured guest appearances by such noted personalities as Joanna Lumley as the Sydney Opera House Woman, Jackie Mason as the East River Creature, Miriam Margolyes as the Smelly Photocopier Woman, BBC Radio cricket legends Henry Blofeld and Fred Trueman as themselves, June Whitfield as the Raffle Woman, Leslie Phillips as Hactar, Saeed Jaffrey as the Man on the Pole, Sir Patrick Moore as himself, and Christian Slater as Wonko the Sane. Finally, Adams himself played the role of Agrajag, a performance adapted from his book-on-tape reading of the third novel, and edited into the series created some time after the author's death.\nRadio series 6.\nThe first of six episodes in a sixth series, the \"Hexagonal Phase\", was broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on 8 March 2018 and featured Professor Stephen Hawking introducing himself as the voice of \"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Mk II\" by saying: \"I have been quite popular in my time. Some even read my books.\"\nNovels.\nThe novels are described as \"a trilogy in five parts\", having been described as a trilogy on the release of the third book, and then a \"trilogy in four parts\" on the release of the fourth book. The US edition of the fifth book was originally released with the legend \"The fifth book in the increasingly inaccurately named Hitchhiker's Trilogy\" on the cover. Subsequent re-releases of the other novels bore the legend \"The [first, second, third, fourth] book in the increasingly inaccurately named Hitchhiker's Trilogy\". In addition, the blurb on the fifth book describes it as \"the book that gives a whole new meaning to the word 'trilogy'\".\nThe plots of the television and radio series are more or less the same as that of the first two novels, though some of the events occur in a different order and many of the details are changed. Much of parts five and six of the radio series were written by John Lloyd, but his material did not make it into the other versions of the story and is not included here. Many consider the books' version of events to be definitive because they are the most readily accessible and widely distributed version of the story. However, they are not the final version that Adams produced.\nBefore his death from a heart attack on 11 May 2001, Adams was considering writing a sixth novel in the Hitchhiker's series. He was working on a third Dirk Gently novel, under the working title \"The Salmon of Doubt\", but felt that the book was not working and abandoned it. In an interview, he said some of the ideas in the book might fit better in the Hitchhiker's series, and suggested he might rework those ideas into a sixth book in that series. He described \"Mostly Harmless\" as \"a very bleak book\" and said he \"would love to finish \"Hitchhiker\" on a slightly more upbeat note\". Adams also remarked that if he were to write a sixth instalment, he would at least start with all the characters in the same place. Eoin Colfer, who wrote the sixth book in the Hitchhiker's series in 2008\u201309, used this latter concept but none of the plot ideas from \"The Salmon of Doubt\".\n\"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\".\nThe first book was adapted from the first four radio episodes (the Primary Phase), with Arthur being rescued from Earth's destruction by Ford, meeting Zaphod and Trillian, coming to the planet of Magrathea and discovering the true purpose of Earth, and ending with the group preparing to go to the Restaurant at the End of the Universe. It was first published in 1979, initially in paperback, by Pan Books, after BBC Publishing had turned down the offer of publishing a novelisation, an action they would later regret. The book reached number one on the book charts in only its second week, and sold over 250,000 copies within three months of its release. A hardback edition was published by Harmony Books, a division of Random House in the United States in October 1980, and the 1981 US paperback edition was promoted by the give-away of 3,000 free copies in the magazine \"Rolling Stone\" to build word of mouth. In 2005, Del Rey Books re-released the Hitchhiker series with new covers for the release of the 2005 movie. As of 2005, the book version of \"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\" has sold over 14\u00a0million copies.\nA photo-illustrated edition of the first novel appeared in 1994.\n\"The Restaurant at the End of the Universe\".\nIn \"The Restaurant at the End of the Universe\" (published in 1980), Zaphod is separated from the others and finds he is part of a conspiracy to uncover who really runs the Universe. Zaphod meets Zarniwoop, a conspirator and editor for \"The Guide\", who knows where to find the secret ruler. Zaphod becomes briefly reunited with the others for a trip to Milliways, the restaurant of the title. Zaphod and Ford decide to steal a ship from there, which turns out to be a stunt ship pre-programmed to plunge into a star as a special effect in a stage show. Unable to change course, the main characters get Marvin to run the teleporter they find in the ship, which is working other than having no automatic control (someone must remain behind to operate it), and Marvin seemingly sacrifices himself. Zaphod and Trillian discover that the Universe is in the safe hands of a simple man living on a remote planet in a wooden shack with his cat.\nFord and Arthur, meanwhile, end up on a spacecraft full of the outcasts of the Golgafrinchan civilisation. The ship crashes on prehistoric Earth; Ford and Arthur are stranded, and it becomes clear that the inept Golgafrinchans are the ancestors of modern humans, having displaced the Earth's indigenous hominids. This has disrupted the Earth's programming so that when Ford and Arthur manage to extract the final readout from Arthur's subconscious mind by pulling lettered tiles from a Scrabble set, it is \"What do you get if you multiply six by nine?\"\nThe book was adapted from the remaining material in the radio series\u2014covering from the fifth episode to the twelfth episode, although the ordering was greatly changed (in particular, the events of Fit the Sixth, with Ford and Arthur being stranded on pre-historic Earth, end the book, and their rescue in Fit the Seventh is deleted), and most of the Brontitall incident was omitted, instead of the Haggunenon sequence, co-written by John Loyd, the Disaster Area stunt ship was substituted\u2014this having first been introduced in the LP version. Adams himself considered \"Restaurant\" to be his best novel of the five.\n\"Life, the Universe and Everything\".\nIn \"Life, the Universe and Everything\" (published in 1982), Ford and Arthur travel through the space-time continuum from prehistoric Earth to Lord's Cricket Ground. There they run into Slartibartfast, who enlists their aid in preventing galactic war. Long ago, the people of Krikkit attempted to wipe out all life in the Universe, but they were stopped and imprisoned on their home planet; now they are poised to escape. With the help of Marvin, Zaphod, and Trillian, our heroes prevent the destruction of life in the Universe and go their separate ways.\nThis was the first Hitchhiker's book originally written as a book and not adapted from radio. Its story was based on a treatment Adams had written for a \"Doctor Who\" theatrical release, with the Doctor role being split between Slartibartfast (to begin with), and later Trillian and Arthur.\nIn 2004, it was adapted for radio as the Tertiary Phase of the radio series.\n\"So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish\".\nIn \"So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish\" (published in 1984), Arthur returns home to Earth, rather surprisingly since it was destroyed when he left. He meets and falls in love with a girl named Fenchurch, and discovers this Earth is a replacement provided by the dolphins in their Save the Humans campaign. Eventually, he rejoins Ford, who claims to have saved the Universe in the meantime, to hitch-hike one last time and see God's Final Message to His Creation. Along the way, they are joined by Marvin, the Paranoid Android, who, although 37 times older than the universe itself (what with time travel and all), has just enough power left in his failing body to read the message and feel better about it all before expiring.\nThis was the first \"Hitchhiker's\" novel which was not an adaptation of any previously written story or script. In 2005 it was adapted for radio as the Quandary Phase of the radio series.\n\"Mostly Harmless\".\nFinally, in \"Mostly Harmless\" (published in 1992), Vogons take over \"The Hitchhiker's Guide\" (under the name of InfiniDim Enterprises), to finish, once and for all, the task of obliterating the Earth. After abruptly losing Fenchurch and travelling around the galaxy despondently, Arthur's spaceship crashes on the planet Lamuella, where he settles in happily as the official sandwich-maker for a small village of simple, peaceful people. Meanwhile, Ford Prefect breaks into \"The Guide's\" offices, gets himself an infinite expense account from the computer system, and then meets \"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, Mark II\", an artificially intelligent, multi-dimensional guide with vast power and a hidden purpose. After he declines this dangerously powerful machine's aid (which he receives anyway), he sends it to Arthur Dent for safety (\"Oh yes, whose?\"\u2014Arthur).\nTrillian uses DNA that Arthur donated for travelling money to have a daughter, and when she goes to cover a war, she leaves her daughter Random Frequent Flyer Dent with Arthur. Random, a more than typically troubled teenager, steals \"The Guide Mark II\" and uses it to get to Earth. Arthur, Ford, Trillian, and Tricia McMillan (Trillian in this alternate universe) follow her to a crowded club, where an anguished Random becomes startled by a noise and inadvertently fires her gun at Arthur. The shot misses Arthur and kills a man (the ever-unfortunate Agrajag). Immediately afterwards, \"The Guide Mark II\" causes the removal of all possible Earths from probability. All of the main characters, save Zaphod, were on Earth at the time and are apparently killed, bringing a good deal of satisfaction to the Vogons.\nIn 2005 it was adapted for radio as the Quintessential Phase of the radio series, with the final episode first transmitted on 21 June 2005.\n\"And Another Thing...\".\nIt was announced in September 2008 that Eoin Colfer, author of \"Artemis Fowl\", had been commissioned to write the sixth instalment entitled \"And Another Thing...\" with the support of Jane Belson, Adams's widow. The book was published by Penguin Books in the UK and Hyperion in the US in October 2009.\nThe story begins as death rays bear down on Earth, and the characters awaken from a virtual reality. Zaphod picks them up shortly before they are killed, but completely fails to escape the death beams. They are then saved by Bowerick Wowbagger, the Infinitely Prolonged, whom they agree to help kill. Zaphod travels to Asgard to get Thor's help. In the meantime, the Vogons are heading to destroy a colony of people who also escaped Earth's destruction, on the planet Nano. Arthur, Wowbagger, Trillian and Random head to Nano to try to stop the Vogons, and on the journey, Wowbagger and Trillian fall in love, making Wowbagger question whether or not he wants to be killed. Zaphod arrives with Thor, who then signs up to be the planet's God. With Random's help, Thor almost kills Wowbagger. Wowbagger, who merely loses his immortality, then marries Trillian.\nThor then stops the first Vogon attack and apparently dies. Meanwhile, Constant Mown, son of Prostetnic Jeltz, convinces his father that the people on the planet are not citizens of Earth, but are, in fact, citizens of Nano, which means that it would be illegal to kill them. As the book draws to a close, Arthur is on his way to check out a possible university for Random, when, during a hyperspace jump, he is flung across alternate universes, has a brief encounter with Fenchurch, and ends up exactly where he would want to be. And then the Vogons turn up again.\nIn 2017 it was adapted for radio as the \"Hexagonal Phase\" of the radio series, with its premiere episode first transmitted on 8 March 2018 (exactly forty years, to the day, from the first episode of the first series, the Primary Phase).\nOmnibus editions.\nTwo omnibus editions were created by Douglas Adams to combine the Hitchhiker series novels and to \"set the record straight\". The stories came in so many different formats that Adams stated that every time he told it he would contradict himself. Therefore, he stated in the introduction of \"The More Than Complete Hitchhiker's Guide\" that \"anything I put down wrong here is, as far as I'm concerned, wrong for good.\" The two omnibus editions were \"The More Than Complete Hitchhiker's Guide, Complete and Unabridged\" (published in 1987) and \"The Ultimate Hitchhiker's Guide, Complete and Unabridged\" (published in 1997).\n\"The More Than Complete Hitchhiker's Guide\".\nPublished in 1987, this 624-page leatherbound omnibus edition contains \"wrong for good\" versions of the four \"Hitchhiker\" series novels at the time, and also includes one short story:\n\"The Ultimate Hitchhiker's Guide\".\nPublished in 1997, this 832-page leatherbound final omnibus edition contains five \"Hitchhiker\" series novels and one short story:\nAlso appearing in \"The Ultimate Hitchhiker's Guide\", at the end of Adams's introduction, is a list of instructions on \"How to Leave the Planet\", providing a humorous explanation of how one might replicate Arthur and Ford's feat at the beginning of \"Hitchhiker's\".\nTelevision series.\n1981 series.\nThe popularity of the radio series gave rise to a six-episode television series, directed and produced by Alan J.\u00a0W. Bell, which first aired on BBC 2 in January and February 1981. It employed many of the actors from the radio series and was based mainly on the radio versions of Fits the First to Sixth. A second series was at one point planned, with a storyline, according to Alan Bell and Mark Wing-Davey that would have come from Adams's abandoned \"Doctor Who and the Krikkitmen\" project (instead of simply making a TV version of the second radio series). However, Adams got into disputes with the BBC (accounts differ: problems with budget, scripts, and having Alan Bell involved are all offered as causes), and the second series was never made. Elements of \"Doctor Who and the Krikkitmen\" were instead used in the third novel, \"Life, the Universe and Everything\".\nThe main cast was the same as the original radio series, except for David Dixon as Ford Prefect instead of McGivern, and Sandra Dickinson as Trillian instead of Sheridan.\nPlanned television series.\nA new television series for Hulu was announced in July 2019. Carlton Cuse was named as the showrunner alongside Jason Fuchs, who would also be writing for the show. The show would be produced by ABC Signature and Genre Arts. The series was set to premiere in 2021. Production was slated to begin in the summer of 2020 and air on Fox in international markets. The series has reportedly been renewed for a second season. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, production on the series has most likely been delayed. However, a production outlet claimed that the series began production in May 2021. Hulu receives no updates since then, and Cuse and Fuchs appeared to have moved on.\nOther television appearances.\nSegments of several of the books were adapted as part of the BBC's \"The Big Read\" survey and programme, broadcast in late 2003. The film, directed by Deep Sehgal, starred Sanjeev Bhaskar as Arthur Dent, alongside Spencer Brown as Ford Prefect, Nigel Planer as the voice of Marvin, Stephen Hawking as the voice of Deep Thought, Patrick Moore as the voice of the Guide, Roger Lloyd-Pack as Slartibartfast, and Adam Buxton and Joe Cornish as Loonquawl and Phouchg.\nFilm.\nAfter several years of setbacks and renewed efforts to start production and a quarter of a century after the first book was published, the big-screen adaptation of \"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\" was finally shot. Pre-production began in 2003, filming began on 19 April 2004 and post-production began in early September 2004. Adams died during the film's production but had still helped with early screenplays and concepts introduced with the film.\nAfter a London premiere on 20 April 2005, it was released on 28 April in the UK and Australia and on 29 April in the United States and Canada. The movie stars Martin Freeman as Arthur, Yasiin Bey as Ford, Sam Rockwell as President of the Galaxy Zaphod Beeblebrox and Zooey Deschanel as Trillian, with Alan Rickman providing the voice of Marvin the Paranoid Android (and Warwick Davis acting in Marvin's costume), and Stephen Fry as the voice of the Guide/Narrator.\nThe plot of the film adaptation of \"Hitchhiker's Guide\" differs widely from that of the radio show, book and television series. The romantic triangle between Arthur, Zaphod, and Trillian is more prominent in the film; and visits to Vogsphere, the homeworld of the Vogons (which, in the books, was already abandoned), and Viltvodle VI are inserted. The film covers roughly events in the first four radio episodes, and ends with the characters en route to the Restaurant at the End of the Universe, leaving the opportunity for a sequel open. A unique appearance is made by the Point-of-View Gun, a device specifically created by Adams himself for the movie.\nCommercially the film was a modest success, taking $21\u00a0million in its opening weekend in the United States, and nearly \u00a33.3\u00a0million in its opening weekend in the United Kingdom.\nThe film was released on DVD (Region 2, PAL) in the UK on 5 September 2005. Both a standard double-disc edition and a UK-exclusive numbered limited edition \"Giftpack\" were released on this date. The \"Giftpack\" edition includes a copy of the novel with a \"movie tie-in\" cover, and collectible prints from the film, packaged in a replica of the film's version of the \"Hitchhiker's Guide\" prop. A single-disc widescreen or full-screen edition (Region 1, NTSC) were made available in the United States and Canada on 13 September 2005. Single-disc releases in the Blu-ray format and UMD format for the PlayStation Portable were also released on the respective dates in these three countries.\nStage shows.\nThere have been multiple professional and amateur stage adaptations of \"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\". Three early professional productions were staged in 1979 and 1980.\nThe first of these was performed at the Institute of Contemporary Arts in London, between 1 and 19 May 1979,&lt;ref name=\"repository.liverpool/3181518\"&gt;https://&lt;/ref&gt; starring Chris Langham as Arthur Dent (Langham later returned to \"Hitchhiker's\" as Prak in the final episode of 2004's Tertiary Phase) and Richard Hope as Ford Prefect. This show was adapted from the first series' scripts and was directed by Ken Campbell, who went on to perform a character in the final episode of the second radio series. The show ran 90 minutes, but had an audience limited to eighty people per night. Actors performed on a variety of ledges and platforms, and the audience was pushed around in a hovercar, 1/2000th of an inch above the floor. This was the first time that Zaphod was represented by having two actors in one large costume. The narration of \"The Book\" was split between two females, an adaptation that has appeared in no other version of \"H2G2\". One of these narrators, Cindy Oswin,&lt;ref name=\"cindyoswin/hitchhikers-on-stage\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; went on to voice Trillian for the LP adaptation.\nThe second stage show was performed throughout Wales between 15 January and 23 February 1980. This was a production of Theatr Clwyd, and was directed by Jonathan Petherbridge. The company performed adaptations of complete radio episodes, at times doing two episodes in a night, and at other times doing all six episodes of the first series in single three-hour sessions. This adaptation was performed again at the Oxford Playhouse in December 1981, the Bristol Hippodrome, Plymouth's Theatre Royal in May\u2013June 1982, the Belgrade Theatre, Coventry, in July 1983 and La Boite in Brisbane, November 1983.\nThe third and least successful stage show was held at the Rainbow Theatre in London, in July 1980. This was the second production directed by Ken Campbell. The Rainbow Theatre had been adapted for stagings of rock operas in the 1970s, and both reference books mentioned in footnotes indicate that this, coupled with incidental music throughout the performance, caused some reviewers to label it as a \"musical\". This was the first adaptation for which Adams wrote the \"Dish of the Day\" sequence. The production ran for over three hours, and was widely panned for this, as well as for the music, laser effects, and the acting. Despite attempts to shorten the script, and make other changes, it closed three or four weeks early (accounts differ), and lost a lot of money. Despite the bad reviews, there were at least two stand-out performances: Michael Cule and David Learner both went on from this production to appearances in the TV adaptation.\nIn December 2011 a new stage production was announced to begin touring in June 2012. This included members of the original radio and TV casts such as Simon Jones, Geoff McGivern, Susan Sheridan, Mark Wing-Davey and Stephen Moore with VIP guests playing the role of the Book. It was produced in the form of a radio show which could be downloaded when the tour was completed. This production was based on the first four Fits in the first act, with the second act covering material from the rest of the series. The show also featured a band, who performed the songs \"Share and Enjoy\", the Krikkit song \"Under the Ink Black Sky\", Marvin's song \"How I Hate The Night\", and \"Marvin\", which was a minor hit in 1981.\nThe production featured a series of \"VIP guests\" as the voice of The Book including Billy Boyd, Phill Jupitus, Rory McGrath, Roger McGough, Jon Culshaw, Christopher Timothy, Andrew Sachs, John Challis, Hugh Dennis, John Lloyd, Terry Jones and Neil Gaiman. The tour started on 8 June 2012 at the Theatre Royal, Glasgow and continued through the summer until 21 July when the final performance was at Playhouse Theatre, Edinburgh. The production started touring again in September 2013, but the remaining dates of the tour were cancelled due to poor ticket sales.\nOther adaptations.\nVinyl LPs.\nThe first four radio episodes were adapted for a double LP, also entitled \"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\" (appended with \"Part One\" for the subsequent Canadian release), first by mail-order only, and later into stores. The double LP and its sequel were originally released by Original Records in the United Kingdom in 1979 and 1980, with the catalogue numbers ORA042 and ORA054 respectively. They were first released by Hannibal Records in 1982 (as HNBL 2301 and HNBL 1307, respectively) in the United States and Canada, and later re-released in a slightly abridged edition by Simon &amp; Schuster's Audioworks in the mid-1980s. Both were produced by Geoffrey Perkins and featured cover artwork by Hipgnosis.\nThe script in the first double LP very closely follows the first four radio episodes, although further cuts had to be made for reasons of timing. Despite this, other lines of dialogue that were indicated as having been cut when the original scripts from the radio series were eventually published can be heard in the LP version. The Simon &amp; Schuster cassettes omit the Veet Voojagig narration, the cheerleader's speech as Deep Thought concludes its seven-and-one-half-million-year programme, and a few other lines from both sides of the second LP of the set.\nMost of the original cast returned, except for Susan Sheridan, who was recording a voice for the character of Princess Eilonwy in \"The Black Cauldron\" for Walt Disney Pictures. Cindy Oswin voiced Trillian on all three LPs in her place. Other casting changes in the first double LP included Stephen Moore taking on the additional role of the barman, and Valentine Dyall as the voice of Deep Thought. Adams's voice can be heard making the public address announcements on Magrathea.\nBecause of copyright issues, the music used during the first radio series was either replaced, or in the case of the title it was re-recorded in a new arrangement. Composer Tim Souster did both duties (with Paddy Kingsland contributing music as well), and Souster's version of the theme was the version also used for the eventual television series.\nThe sequel LP was released, singly, as \"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Part Two: The Restaurant at the End of the Universe\" in the UK, and simply as \"The Restaurant at the End of the Universe\" in the USA. The script here mostly follows Fit the Fifth and Fit the Sixth, but includes a song by the backup band in the restaurant (\"Reg Nullify and his Cataclysmic Combo\"), and changes the Haggunenon sequence to \"Disaster Area\".\nAs the result of a misunderstanding, the second record was released before being cut down in a final edit that Douglas Adams and Geoffrey Perkins had both intended to make. Perkins has said, \"[I]t is far too long on each side. It's just a rough cut. [...] I felt it was flabby, and I wanted to speed it up.\" The Simon &amp; Schuster Audioworks re-release of this LP was also abridged slightly from its original release. The scene with Ford Prefect and Hotblack Desiato's bodyguard is omitted.\nSales for the first double-LP release were primarily through mail order. Total sales reached over 60,000 units, with half of those being mail order, and the other half through retail outlets. This is in spite of the facts that Original Records' warehouse ordered and stocked more copies than they were actually selling for quite some time, and that Paul Neil Milne Johnstone complained about his name and then-current address being included in the recording. This was corrected for a later pressing of the double-LP by \"cut[ting] up that part of the master tape and reassembl[ing] it in the wrong order\". The second LP release (\"Part Two\") also only sold a total of 60,000 units in the UK. The distribution deals for the United States and Canada with Hannibal Records and Simon and Schuster were later negotiated by Douglas Adams and his agent, Ed Victor, after gaining full rights to the recordings from Original Records, which went bankrupt.\nAll five phases were released on LP in 2018 by Demon Records, and for its 42nd anniversary, the original \"Hitchhiker's Guide\" and \"Restaurant at the End of the Universe\" were combined into a three-record set that was released in August 2020 for Record Store Day, also by Demon Records. It is available in three versions: Translucent Vogon Green, Translucent Magrathean Blue and Translucent Pan-Galactic Purple.\nAudiobooks.\nThere have been three audiobook recordings of the novel. The first was an abridged edition (), recorded in the mid-1980s for the EMI label Music For Pleasure by Stephen Moore, best known for playing the voice of Marvin the Paranoid Android in the radio series and in the TV series. In 1990, Adams himself recorded an unabridged edition for Dove Audiobooks (), later re-released by New Millennium Audio () in the United States and available from BBC Audiobooks in the United Kingdom. Also by arrangement with Dove, ISIS Publishing Ltd produced a numbered exclusive edition signed by Douglas Adams () in 1994. To tie-in with the 2005 film, actor Stephen Fry, the film's voice of the Guide, recorded a second abridged edition ().\nIn addition, unabridged versions of books 2-5 of the series were recorded by Martin Freeman for Random House Audio. Freeman plays Arthur in the 2005 film adaptation. Audiobooks 2-5 follow in order and include: \"The Restaurant at the End of the Universe\" (); \"Life, the Universe, and Everything\" (); \"So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish\" (); and \"Mostly Harmless\" ().\nVideo games.\nSometime between 1982 and 1984 (accounts differ), the British company Supersoft published a text-based adventure game based on the book, which was released in versions for the Commodore PET and Commodore 64. One account states that there was a dispute as to whether valid permission for publication had been granted, and following legal action the game was withdrawn and all remaining copies were destroyed. Another account states that the programmer, Bob Chappell, rewrote the game to remove all \"Hitchhiker's\" references, and republished it as \"Cosmic Capers\".\nOfficially, the TV series was followed in 1984 by a best-selling \"interactive fiction\", or text-based adventure game, distributed by Infocom. It was designed by Adams and Infocom regular Steve Meretzky and was one of Infocom's most successful games. As with many Infocom games, the box contained a number of \"feelies\" including a \"Don't panic\" badge, some \"pocket fluff\", a pair of peril-sensitive sunglasses (made of cardboard), an order for the destruction of the Earth, a small, clear plastic bag containing \"a microscopic battle fleet\" and an order for the destruction of Arthur Dent's house (signed by Adams and Meretzky).\nIn September 2004, it was revived by the BBC on the \"Hitchhiker's\" section of the Radio 4 website for the initial broadcast of the Tertiary Phase, and is still available to play online. This new version uses an original Infocom datafile with a custom-written interpreter, by Sean Soll\u00e9, and Flash programming by Shimon Young, both of whom used to work at The Digital Village (TDV). The new version includes illustrations by Rod Lord, who was head of Pearce Animation Studios in 1980, which produced the guide graphics for the TV series. On 2 March 2005 it won the Interactive BAFTA in the \"best online entertainment\" category.\nA sequel to the original Infocom game was never made. An all-new, fully graphical game was designed and developed by a joint venture between The Digital Village and PAN Interactive (no connection to Pan Books\u00a0/ Pan MacMillan). This new game was planned and developed between 1998 and 2002, but like the sequel to the Infocom game, it also never materialised. In April 2005, Starwave Mobile released two mobile games to accompany the release of the film adaptation. The first, developed by Atatio, was called \"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy: Vogon Planet Destructor\". It was a typical top-down shooter and except for the title had little to do with the actual story. The second game, developed by TKO Software, was a graphical adventure game named \"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy: Adventure Game\". Despite its name, the newly designed puzzles by TKO Software's Ireland studio were different from the Infocom ones, and the game followed the movie's script closely and included the new characters and places. The \"Adventure Game\" won the IGN's \"Editors' Choice Award\" in May 2005.\nOn 25 May 2011, Hothead Games announced they were working on a new edition of The Guide. Along with the announcement, Hothead Games launched a teaser web site made to look like an announcement from Megadodo Publications that The Guide will soon be available on Earth. It has since been revealed that they are developing an iOS app in the style of the fictional Guide.\nComic books.\nIn 1993, DC Comics, in conjunction with Byron Preiss Visual Publications, published a three-part comic book adaptation of the novelisation of \"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\". This was followed up with three-part adaptations of \"The Restaurant at the End of the Universe\" in 1994, and \"Life, the Universe and Everything\" in 1996. There was also a series of collectors' cards with art from and inspired by the comic adaptations of the first book, and a graphic novelisation (or \"collected edition\") combining the three individual comic books from 1993, itself released in May 1997. Douglas Adams was deeply opposed to the use of American English spellings and idioms in what he felt was a very British story, and had to be talked into it by the American publishers, although he remained very unhappy with the compromise.\nThe adaptations were scripted by John Carnell. Steve Leialoha provided the art for \"Hitchhiker's\" and the layouts for \"Restaurant\". Shepherd Hendrix did the finished art for \"Restaurant\". Neil Vokes and John Nyberg did the finished artwork for \"Life\", based on breakdowns by Paris Cullins (Book 1) and Christopher Schenck (Books 2\u20133). The miniseries were edited by Howard Zimmerman and Ken Grobe.\nLive radio.\nOn Saturday 29 March 2014, Radio 4 broadcast an adaptation in front of a live audience, featuring many members of the original cast including Stephen Moore, Susan Sheridan, Mark Wing-Davey, Simon Jones and Geoff McGivern, with John Lloyd as the book.\nThe adaptation was adapted by Dirk Maggs primarily from Fit the First, including material from the books and later radio Fits as well as some new jokes. It formed part of Radio 4's \"Character Invasion\" series.\nLegacy.\nFuture predictions.\nWhile Adams' writing in \"The Hitchhiker's Guide\" was mostly to poke fun at scientific advance, such as through the artificial personalities built into the work's robots, Adams had predicted some concepts that have since come to be reality. The Guide itself, described as a small book-sized object that held a great volume of information, predated computer laptops and is comparable to tablet computers. The idea of being able to instantaneously translate between any language, a function provided by the Babel Fish, has since become possible with several software products that work in near real-time. In the \"Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\", Adams also mentions computers being controlled by voice, touch and gesture, a reality for humans today.\n\"Hitch-Hikeriana\".\nMany merchandising and spin-off items (or \"Hitch-Hikeriana\") were produced in the early 1980s, including towels in different colours, all bearing the Guide entry for towels. Later runs of towels include those made for promotions by Pan Books, Touchstone Pictures\u00a0/ Disney for the 2005 movie, and different towels made for ZZ9 Plural Z Alpha, the official \"Hitchhiker's\" Appreciation society. Other items that first appeared in the mid-1980s were T-shirts, including those made for Infocom (such as one bearing the legend \"I got the Babel Fish\" for successfully completing one of that game's most difficult puzzles), and a Disaster Area tour T-shirt. Other official items have included \"Beeblebears\" (teddy bears with an extra head and arm, named after \"Hitchhiker's\" character Zaphod Beeblebrox, sold by the official Appreciation Society), an assortment of pin-on buttons and a number of novelty singles. Many of the above items are displayed throughout the 2004 \"25th Anniversary Illustrated Edition\" of the novel, which used items from the personal collections of fans of the series.\nStephen Moore recorded two novelty singles in character as Marvin, the Paranoid Android: \"Marvin\"/\"Metal Man\" and \"Reasons To Be Miserable\"/\"Marvin I Love You\". The last song has appeared on a Dr. Demento compilation. Another single featured the re-recorded \"Journey of the Sorcerer\" (arranged by Tim Souster) backed with \"Reg Nullify In Concert\" by Reg Nullify, and \"Only the End of the World Again\" by Disaster Area (including Douglas Adams on bass guitar) . These discs have since become collector's items.\nThe 2005 movie also added quite a few collectibles, mostly through the National Entertainment Collectibles Association. These included three prop replicas of objects seen on the Vogon ship and homeworld (a mug, a pen and a stapler), sets of \"action figures\" with a height of either 3 or 6\u00a0inches (76\u00a0or 150\u00a0mm), a gun\u2014based on a prop used by Marvin, the Paranoid Android, that shoots foam darts\u2014a crystal cube, shot glasses, a ten-inch (254\u00a0mm) high version of Marvin with eyes that light up green, and \"yarn doll\" versions of Arthur Dent, Ford Prefect, Trillian, Marvin and Zaphod Beeblebrox. Also, various audio tracks were released to coincide with the movie, notably re-recordings of \"Marvin\" and \"Reasons To Be Miserable\", sung by Stephen Fry, along with some of the \"Guide Entries\", newly written material read in-character by Fry.\nTowel Day.\nCelebrated on 25 May, Towel Day is a fan-created event in which they carry a towel with them throughout the day, in reference to the importance of towels as a tool of a galactic hitchhiker described in the work. The annual event was started in 2001, two weeks after Adams' death.\n42, or The Answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything.\nIn the works, the number 42 is given as The Answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything by the computer Deep Thought. The absurdly simple answer to a complex philosophical question became a frequent reference in popular culture in homage to \"The Hitchhiker's Guide\", particularly within works of science fiction and in video games, such as in \"Doctor Who\", \"Lost\", \"Star Trek\" and \"The X-Files\".\nThe 42nd anniversary of HG2G appearing on Radio 4 was 2020. The book \"Hitchhiking: Cultural Inroads\" was dedicated to the memory of British actor Stephen V. Moore who died in October 2019 and played the voice of Marvin the Paranoid Android in the original BBC radio and television series.\nOther references in popular culture.\nTwo asteroids, \"18610 Arthurdent\" and \"25924 Douglasadams\" were named after Arthur Dent and Douglas Adams, as both had been discovered shortly after Adams' death in 2001. The fish species \"Bidenichthys beeblebroxi\" and moth species \"Erechthias beeblebroxi\" were both named after the character of Zaphod Beeblebrox.\nRadiohead's song \"Paranoid Android\" was named after the character of Marvin the Paranoid Android. The band's singer Thom Yorke used the character's name jokingly, as the song was not about depression, but Yorke knew many of his fans felt that he should seem to be depressed. The album \"OK Computer\" which \"Paranoid Android\" appears on is also taken from \"The Hitchhiker's Guide\", referencing how Zaphod would address the Heart of Gold's onboard computer Eddie, and was selected by the band after listening to the radio plays while travelling on tour.\nOther \"Hitchhiker's\"-related books and stories.\nRelated stories.\nA short story by Adams, \"Young Zaphod Plays It Safe\", first appeared in 1986, in \"The Utterly Utterly Merry Comic Relief Christmas Book\", a special large-print compilation of different stories and pictures that raised money for the then-new Comic Relief charity in the UK. The story also appears in some of the omnibus editions of the trilogy, and in \"The Salmon of Doubt\". There are two versions of this story, one of which is slightly more explicit in its political commentary.\nA novel, \"\", written by Terry Jones, is based on Adams's computer game of the same name, \"Douglas Adams's Starship Titanic\", which in turn is based on an idea from \"Life, the Universe and Everything\". The idea concerns a luxury passenger starship that suffers \"sudden and gratuitous total existence failure\" on its maiden voyage.\nWowbagger the Infinitely Prolonged, a character from \"Life, the Universe and Everything\", also appears in a short story by Adams titled \"The Private Life of Genghis Khan\" which appears in some early editions of \"The Salmon of Doubt\".\nPublished radio scripts.\nDouglas Adams and Geoffrey Perkins collaborated on \"\", first published in the United Kingdom and United States in 1985. A tenth-anniversary (of the script book publication) edition was printed in 1995, and a twenty-fifth-anniversary (of the first radio series broadcast) edition was printed in 2003.\nThe 2004 series was produced by Above The Title Productions and the scripts were published in July 2005, with production notes for each episode. This second radio script book is entitled \"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Radio Scripts: The Tertiary, Quandary and Quintessential Phases\". Douglas Adams gets the primary writer's credit (as he wrote the original novels), and there is a foreword by Simon Jones, introductions by the producer and the director, and other introductory notes from other members of the cast.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\nOfficial sites\nEncyclopedia\nMetadata\nOther links\n"}
{"id": "31358", "revid": "2051880", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31358", "title": "The Art of Computer Programming", "text": "Books about algorithms by Donald Knuth\nThe Art of Computer Programming (TAOCP) is a comprehensive multi-volume monograph written by the computer scientist Donald Knuth presenting programming algorithms and their analysis. As of 2025[ [update]] it consists of published volumes 1, 2, 3, 4A, and 4B, with more expected to be released in the future. The Volumes 1\u20135 are intended to represent the central core of computer programming for sequential machines; the subjects of Volumes 6 and 7 are important but more specialized.\nWhen Knuth began the project in 1962, he originally conceived of it as a single book with twelve chapters. The first three volumes of what was then expected to be a seven-volume set were published in 1968, 1969, and 1973. Work began in earnest on Volume 4 in 1973, but was suspended in 1977 for work on typesetting prompted by the second edition of Volume 2. Writing of the final copy of Volume 4A began in longhand in 2001, and the first online pre-fascicle, 2A, appeared later in 2001. The first published installment of Volume 4 appeared in paperback as Fascicle 2 in 2005. The hardback Volume 4A, combining Volume 4, Fascicles 0\u20134, was published in 2011. Volume 4, Fascicle 6 (\"Satisfiability\") was released in December 2015; Volume 4, Fascicle 5 (\"Mathematical Preliminaries Redux; Backtracking; Dancing Links\") was released in November 2019.\nVolume 4B consists of material evolved from Fascicles 5 and 6. The manuscript was sent to the publisher on August 1, 2022, and the volume was published in September 2022. Fascicle 7 (\"Constraint Satisfaction\"), planned for Volume 4C, was the subject of Knuth's talk on August 3, 2022 and was published on February 5, 2025.\nHistory.\nAfter winning a Westinghouse Talent Search scholarship, Knuth enrolled at the Case Institute of Technology (now Case Western Reserve University), where his performance was so outstanding that the faculty voted to award him a master of science upon his completion of the bachelor's degree. During his summer vacations, Knuth was hired by the Burroughs Corporation to write compilers, earning more in his summer months than full professors did for an entire year. Such exploits made Knuth a topic of discussion among the mathematics department, which included Richard S. Varga.\nIn January 1962, when he was a graduate student in the mathematics department at Caltech, Knuth was approached by Addison-Wesley to write a book about compiler design, and he proposed a larger scope. He came up with a list of twelve chapter titles the same day. In the summer of 1962 he worked on a FORTRAN compiler for UNIVAC, considering that he had \"sold my soul to the devil\" to develop a FORTRAN compiler after ALGOL developments with Burroughs. He remained as a consultant to Burroughs over the period 1960 to 1968 while writing Volume 1 \"Fundamental Algorithms\".\nDuring this time, he also developed a mathematical analysis of linear probing, which convinced him to present the material with a quantitative approach. After receiving his Ph.D. in June 1963, he began working on his manuscript, of which he finished his first draft in June 1965, at hand-written pages. He had assumed that about five hand-written pages would translate into one printed page, but his publisher said instead that about &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;1+1\u20442 hand-written pages translated to one printed page. This meant he had approximately printed pages of material, which closely matches the size of the first three published volumes.\nThe first volume of \"The Art of Computer Programming\", \"Fundamental Algorithms\", took five years to complete between 1963 and 1968 while working at both Caltech and Burroughs.\nKnuth's dedication in Volume 1 reads:\nThis series of books is affectionately dedicated&lt;br&gt;to the Type 650 computer once installed at&lt;br&gt;Case Institute of Technology,&lt;br&gt;in remembrance of many pleasant evenings.\nIn the preface, he thanks first his wife Jill, then Burroughs for the use of B220 and B5500 computers in testing most of the programs, and Caltech, the National Science Foundation, and the Office of Naval Research.\nSection 2.5 of \"Fundamental Algorithms\" is on Dynamic Storage Allocation. Parts of this are used in the Burroughs approach to memory management. Knuth claims credit for: \u201cthe \u201cboundary-tag\u201d method, introduced in Section 2.5, was designed by the author in 1962 for use in a control program for the B5000 computer.\u201d460\nKnuth received support from Richard S. Varga, who was the scientific adviser to the publisher. Varga was visiting Olga Taussky-Todd and John Todd at Caltech. With Varga's enthusiastic endorsement, the publisher accepted Knuth's expanded plans. In its expanded version, the book would be published in seven volumes, each with just one or two chapters. Due to the growth in Chapter 7, which was fewer than 100 pages of the 1965 manuscript, per Vol. 4A p. vi, the plan for Volume 4 has since expanded to include Volumes 4A, 4B, 4C, 4D, and possibly more.\nIn 1976, Knuth prepared a second edition of Volume 2, requiring it to be typeset again, but the style of type used in the first edition (called hot type) was no longer available. In 1977, he decided to spend some time creating something more suitable. Eight years later, he returned with TEX, which is currently used for all volumes.\nAnother characteristic of the volumes is the variation in the difficulty of the exercises including a numerical rating varying from 0 to 50, where 0 is trivial, and 50 is an open question in contemporary research.\nBounty for finding errors.\nThe offer of a so-called Knuth reward check worth \"one hexadecimal dollar\" (100HEX base 16 cents, in decimal, is $2.56) for any errors found, and the correction of these errors in subsequent printings, has contributed to the highly polished and still-authoritative nature of the work, long after its first publication.\nAssembly language in the book.\nAll examples in the books use a hypothetical language called \"MIX assembly language\" (MIXAL), which runs on \"a mythical computer called MIX\". Currently, the MIX computer is being replaced by the MMIX computer, which is a RISC version. The conversion from MIX to MMIX was a large ongoing project for which Knuth solicited volunteers for help. Software such as GNU MDK exists to provide emulation of the MIX architecture. Knuth considers the use of assembly language necessary for the speed and memory usage of algorithms to be judged.\nAccording to Knuth, MIX was much like any computer then in existence, but nicer. The name 'MIX' is 1009 in Roman numerals and this is given by a formula involving series numbers of several computers of the time: (360 + 650 + 709 + U3 + SS80 + 1107 + 1604 + G2- + B220 + S2000 + 920 + 601 + H800 + PDP-4 + 11)/16 = 1009 or MIX. The name MMIX is 2009 in Roman numerals and Knuth claims MMIX is even nicer than MIX.\nCritical response.\nKnuth was awarded the 1974 Turing Award \"for his major contributions to the analysis of algorithms [\u2026], and in particular for his contributions to the 'art of computer programming' through his well-known books in a continuous series by this title.\" \"American Scientist\" has included this work among \"100 or so Books that shaped a Century of Science\", referring to the twentieth century. Covers of the third edition of Volume 1 quote Bill Gates as saying, \"If you think you're a really good programmer\u2026 read (Knuth's) \"Art of Computer Programming\"\u2026 You should definitely send me a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 if you can read the whole thing.\" \"The New York Times\" referred to it as \"the profession's defining treatise\".\nEnglish editions.\nCurrent editions.\nThese are the current editions in order by volume number:\nPrevious editions.\nComplete volumes.\nThese volumes were superseded by newer editions and are in order by date.\nFascicles.\nVolume 4, Fascicles 0\u20134 were revised and published as Volume\u00a04A.\nVolume 4, Fascicles 5\u20136 were revised and published as Volume\u00a04B.\nPre-fascicles.\nVolume 1\nVolume 4\nThe remaining pre-fascicles contain draft material that is set to appear in future fascicles and volumes.\nReferences.\nNotes\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

They can be combined to make a full meal and are served cold (such as mixed olives and cheese) or hot (such as , which are battered, fried baby squid; or , spicy potatoes). In some bars and restaurants in Spain and across the globe, tapas have evolved into a sophisticated cuisine. In some Central American countries, such snacks are known as . In parts of Mexico, similar dishes are called \"botanas\".\nAn individual appetizer (or single order of an item) is a .\nHistory.\nThe word \"tapas\", a plural, is derived from the Spanish verb \"tapar\", \"to cover.\" Multiple theories for the term's use for appetizers exist.\nOne theory holds that in pre-19th-century Spain few innkeepers at \"posadas\", \"albergues\" or \"bodegas\" offering meals and rooms for travellers could write and few travellers read, so guests were offered a sample of the dishes available on a \"tapa\" (\u201cpot cover\u201d in Spanish).\nIn another theory, offered by the \"Joy of Cooking\", the original tapas were thin slices of bread or meat which sherry drinkers in Andalusian taverns used to cover their glasses between sips. This was a practical measure meant to prevent fruit flies from hovering over the sweet sherry (see below for more explanations). The meat used to cover the sherry was normally ham or chorizo, which are both very salty and activate thirst. Because of this, bartenders and restaurant owners created a variety of snacks to serve with sherry, thus increasing their alcohol sales. The tapas eventually became as important as the sherry.\nTapas have evolved through Spanish history by incorporating new ingredients and influences. Most of the Iberian Peninsula was invaded by the Romans in 218 B.C., who introduced more extensive cultivation of the olive and irrigation methods following their arrival. The discovery of the New World brought the introduction of tomatoes, sweet and chili peppers, maize (corn), and potatoes, which were readily accepted and easily grown in Spain's microclimates.\nIt has also been claimed that tapas originated in the south of Spain during the time of the Spanish Inquisition as a means of publicly identifying \"conversos\", Jews who had converted to Christianity. Since tapas often consist in part of ham or other non-kosher foodstuffs, the reluctance of the \"conversos\" to eat whatever tapas dish was offered to them could be taken as a tacit admission that they had not abandoned their Jewish faith, thus tapas were a tool of the Spanish Inquisition.\nThere are many tapas competitions throughout Spain. Beginning in 2005 the city of Valladolid in Northwest Spain has hosted a national tapas competition each November. Interest in this event outside of Spain spurred the International School of Culinary Arts to hold an International Tapas Competition for Culinary Schools, starting in 2009. Various schools from around the world come to Spain annually to compete in it for the best tapa concept.\nOrigin.\nThough the primary meaning of \"tapa \"is cover or lid\",\" in Spain it has also become a term for this style of food. The origin of this new meaning is uncertain but there are several theories:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is the capital of the province of Toledo and the \"de jure\" seat of the government and parliament of the autonomous community of Castilla\u2013La Mancha.\nToledo is primarily located on the right (north) bank of the Tagus in central Iberia, nestled in a bend of the river.\nBuilt on a previous Carpetanian settlement, Toledo developed into an important Roman city of Hispania, later becoming the capital of the Visigothic Kingdom and seat of a powerful archdiocese. Often unsubmissive to Umayyad central rule during the Islamic period, Toledo nonetheless acquired a status as a major cultural centre promoting productive cultural exchanges between the Islamic world and Latin Christendom, which it retained after the collapse of the caliphate and the creation of the Taifa of Toledo in the early 11th century. Following the Christian conquest in 1085, Toledo continued to enjoy an important status within the Crown of Castile and remained open to Muslim and Jewish influences for the next two centuries. In the early modern period, the economy stayed afloat for a while after the loss of political power to Madrid thanks to the silk industry, but Toledo entered a true decline in the 1630s, in the context of overall economic recession.\nIn the 21st century, population growth in the municipality has largely concentrated in the Santa Mar\u00eda de Benquerencia (a.k.a. Pol\u00edgono) district, a modern residential area detached from the historic centre located upstream on the left (south) bank of the Tagus. As of January\u00a02024[ [update]], the municipality had a population of 86,526. The municipality has an area of .\nThe city has a Gothic cathedral and a long history in the production of bladed weapons, which are now commonly sold as souvenirs. Toledo was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1986 for its extensive monumental and cultural heritage.\nToponym.\nOver the centuries, the city has been known by various names: \"Toletum\" in Latin, \"Tulaytulah\" () in Arabic, \"Toldoth\" () in Judaeo-Spanish, and \"Tol\u00e9tho\" in Andalusi Romance. The earliest written reference to \"Toletum\" appears in the work of the Roman historian Livy, who suggested that the name derived from \"Tollitum\", which evolved into \"Tollitu\", \"Tollito\", \"Tolleto\", \"Tolledo\", and eventually \"Toledo\". The name is thought to mean \"raised\" or \"elevated\". An alternative interpretation, cited by Mart\u00edn Gallego, attributes the name to the \"double bends or meanders formed by the river that surrounds it.\" The 12th-century writer Abu Abd Allah al-Ayyubi claimed that \"Tulaytulah\" (), the Arabic name for the city, means \"the joyful\", though he offered no further explanation. Jewish tradition derives the name from the Hebrew \"toledot\" (\"generations\" or \"histories\") or \"tulaytula\" (\"wandering\" or \"migration\"), associating it with Jewish exiles who are said to have settled in the area following the destruction of Jerusalem in 70 CE.\nThe name Toledo has been adopted by five cities in the United States\u2014located in the states of Ohio, Illinois, Oregon, Iowa, and Washington\u2014as well as by other localities in Canada, Belize, Brazil, Portugal, Colombia, the Philippines, and Uruguay. In Spain, there are four additional places bearing the name in the provinces of Huesca, Ourense, Asturias, and Tenerife.\nOne of Toledo's well-known epithets, \"The City of Three Cultures\", refers to a historical period during which Christians, Jews, and Muslims coexisted in the city. However, this label has been described as \"grandiose\" and is often attributed to politicians and tourism promoters. Critics argue that the myth of peaceful religious coexistence masks a more complex history marked by religious oppression.\nCoat of arms.\nThe town was granted arms in the 16th century, which were based on the coat of arms of the King of Spain by special royal privilege.\nHistory.\nRoman era and late antiquity.\nToledo () is described by the Roman historian Livy (ca. 59 BCE \u2013 17 CE) as \"urbs parva, sed loco munita\" (\"a small city, but fortified by location\"). Roman general Marcus Fulvius Nobilior fought a battle near the city in 193 BCE against a confederation of Celtic tribes, defeating them and capturing a king called Hilermus. At that time, Toletum was a city of the Carpetani tribe in the region of Carpetania. It was incorporated into the Roman Empire as a \"civitas stipendiaria\" (a tributary city of non-citizens) and later as a municipium. With this status, city officials obtained Roman citizenship for public service, and the forms of Roman law and politics were increasingly adopted. At approximately this time, a Roman circus, city walls, public baths, and a municipal water supply and storage system were constructed in Toletum.\nThe Roman circus in Toledo was one of the largest in Hispania. The circus could hold up to 15,000 spectators. A fragmentary stone inscription records circus games paid for by a citizen of unknown name to celebrate his achieving the sevirate, a kind of priesthood conferring high status. Games were held in the circus late into the 4th and early 5th centuries, an indication of active city life and ongoing patronage by wealthy elites.\nToledo started to gain importance in late antiquity. There are indications that large private houses (\"domus\") within the city walls were enlarged, while several large villas were built north of the city through the 3rd and 4th centuries. Church councils were held in Toledo in the years 400 and 527 to discuss the conflict with Priscillianism. In 546 (or possibly earlier), Visigoth rulers installed the capital of their kingdom in Toledo. King Theudis was in Toledo in 546, where he promulgated the only law of which records remain from the period, known from a single manuscript.\nThroughout the 7th century, a series of further church councils\u2014the so-called Councils of Toledo\u2014attempted to reconcile differing theological views and enacted anti-Jewish laws. By the end of the 7th century, the bishop of Toledo was the leader of all other bishops in Hispania, a situation unusual in Europe. The city was also unmatched as a symbolic center of monarchy.\nWhen internal divisions developed among the Visigothic nobles, Tariq bin Ziyad captured Toledo in 711 or 712 on behalf of the Umayyad Caliphate of Damascus as part of the Islamic conquest of the Iberian Peninsula. Tariq's superior, Governor Musa, disembarked in C\u00e1diz and proceeded to Toledo, where he executed the Visigothic nobles, destroying much of the existing power structure.\nMiddle Ages.\nFollowing the Umayyad conquest, invaders were ethnically diverse, and available evidence suggests that in the area of Toledo (known as \"Tulaytilah\" in Arabic), Berber settlement predominated over Arab. In 742, the Berbers in Al-Andalus rebelled against the Arab Umayyad governors. They took control of the north and unsuccessfully laid siege to the city.\nThe city retained its importance as a literary and ecclesiastical centre well into the mid-8th century, as the Chronicle of 754 demonstrated. During this period, several letters show of the primacy that the church of Toledo held.\nUnder the Umayyad emirate of Cordoba, Toledo was the centre of numerous insurrections against the Cordoban government from 761 to 857. Girbib ibn Abdallah, a poet from Toledo, wrote verses against the Umayyads, helping to inspire a revolt in the city against the new emir in 797. By the end of the 8th century, the Umayyads had made Toledo the administrative center of the Central March of Al-Andalus. In 852, a new revolt broke out in Toledo. The Umayyad governor was held hostage to secure the return of Toledan hostages held in C\u00f3rdoba. In reprisal for a prior attack by Toledans, Emir Muhammad I sent an army to attack them but was defeated. Toledo allied with King Ordo\u00f1o I of Asturias. They fought together at the Battle of Guadacelete but lost. Later in 857, the Toledans attacked Talavera but were again defeated. In 859, Muhammad I negotiated a truce with Toledo. Though locked in conflict with neighboring cities, the city became virtually independent for twenty years. Cordoban authorities re-asserted control over Toledo in 873, after the successful Umayyad siege on the city, which forced defenders to submit. The Banu Qasi gained nominal control of Toledo until 920. A new period of unruliness followed in the 920 and 930s, until Caliph Abd-ar-Rahman III captured the city in 932 after an extensive siege.\nIn the wake of the early 11th-century Fitna of al-Andalus, Toledo became the centre of an independent polity, the so-called Taifa of Toledo, under the rule of the Dhu l-Nunids. The population of Toledo at this time was about 28,000, including a Jewish population of 4,000. The Mozarab community had its own Christian bishop. The \"taifa\" was centered on the Tagus and bordered Sierra de Guadarrama, Guadalajara, Medinaceli, the Taifa of Valencia and the Mountains of Toledo.\nThe taifa, however, fell into political disarray, owing to the economic draining caused by the \"parias\" (tributes) imposed by the Kingdom of Le\u00f3n as well as territorial mutilations, and so a revolt erupted in 1079, which was followed by the Aftasid ruler of Badajoz taking control of the city.\nOn 25 May 1085, Alfonso VI of Le\u00f3n took Toledo and established direct personal control over the city from which he had been exacting tribute. Around that time, the city's demographics featured a heterogeneous composition, with Mozarabs, Muslims, and Jews, to which incoming Christians from northern Iberia and Frankish elements were added. Initially, therefore, different \"fueros\" were simultaneously in force for each community. After the Christian conquest, the city's Mozarab community grew by immigration from the Muslim south.\nToledo preserved its status as a cultural centre. A translation centre was established in which books in Arabic or Hebrew would be translated into Castilian by Muslim and Jewish scholars, and from Castilian into Latin by Castilian scholars, thus letting long-lost knowledge spread through Christian Europe again. Under the Roman Catholic archdiocese of Toledo, multiple persecutions (633, 653, 693) and burnings at the stake of Jews (638) occurred; the Kingdom of Toledo followed up on this tradition with forced conversions and mass murder (1368, 1391, 1449, 1486\u20131490) and rioting and bloodbath against the Jews of Toledo (1212).\nA major popular revolt erupted in 1449, with elements of tax mutiny, anti-Jewish and anti-converso sentiment, and appeals to the civic community, eventually expanding from an urban revolt to anti-seigneurial riots in countryside settlements outside the city.\nModern era.\nDuring the persecution of the Jews in the late 15th and early 16th centuries, members of the local Jewish community produced texts on their long history in Toledo.\nAfter the crushing of the Revolt of the Comuneros, Charles V's court was installed in Toledo, with the monarch choosing the city as his residence at least 15 times from 1525 on. Charles granted the city a coat of arms. From 1528 to 1561 the population increased from 31,930 to 56,270. In 1561, during the first years of his son Philip II's reign, the royal court was moved to Madrid.\nThe archbishops of Toledo remained powerful brokers in the political and religious affairs of Spain for the rest of the \"Ancien R\u00e9gime\", also owning large amounts of seigneurial land across most of the southern half of the Inner Plateau and some nearby territories.\nThe mass arrival of deported unruly Moriscos from Granada ('moriscos nuevos') in Toledo and its lands (6,000 arrived to the city only, at least temporarily) in the wake of the Alpujarras rebellion posed a formidable logistic challenge, and the uneasy preexisting system of social relations between the \"moros viejos\" ('old Moors') and the Old Christians was disrupted. By and large, Granadan new Moriscos were subject to xenophobic abuse and became stigmatised as bloodthirsty and sacrilegious.\nThe city excelled in silk manufacturing during the early modern period. The silk industry reached a peak in the 16th century, entering a protracted decline in the later years of that century and ultimately disappearing by the turn of the 19th century.\nThe Peninsular War affected the city in a very negative way. Over the 19th century, Toledo underwent a progressive change from a convent city to a bureaucratic city. The city being quite impervious to external influence at the time, the bourgeoisie exerted a limited influence.\nFollowing the exclusion of Toledo from the railway to the Portuguese border in the 1850s, the construction of a rail connection from Castillejo to Toledo promoted by the Marquis of Salamanca was approved in June 1856. The line was opened on 12 June 1858. Tourism fostered by the arrival of rail contributed to the development of the hospitality industry in the late 19th century. By the turn of the 20th century, Toledo's population stood at about 23,000. The neighborhood of Santa B\u00e1rbara came into existence after the arrival of rail.\nFollowing the July 1936 coup d'etat in Spain, the acting military commander in Toledo, Jos\u00e9 Moscard\u00f3, refused to provide weapons to Madrid and hid instead in the Alc\u00e1zar with a garrison of about 1,000 rebels, food, ammunition and some hostages. After 21 July, they became subject to an unsuccessful siege by forces loyal to the Republic during the early stages of the Spanish Civil War. Leading rebel general (and soon-to-be dictator of Spain) Francisco Franco and his Army of Africa took a detour from their advance towards Madrid (which gave the Republicans time to build up the defenses in Madrid and receive early foreign support) and lifted the siege of the Alc\u00e1zar in late September 1936. The two months of resistance of the garrisoned rebel military would become a core symbol of the mythology built around the Francoist regime and its ideology.\nBy 1950, the population was around 40,243. Urban planning vis-\u00e0-vis the development of the neighborhoods of Palomarejos and Pol\u00edgono ensued in the second half of the 20th century.\nIn the 1980s, in the context of the creation of the autonomous communities in Spain, Toledo became the \"de facto\" capital of the autonomous community of Castilla\u2013La Mancha, hosting the seat of the Cortes of Castilla\u2013La Mancha (the regional legislature) and the presidency of the regional government (the executive).\nToledo continues to be a major tourist destination, attracting visitors from around the world who come to see historic landmarks, such as the Toledo Cathedral, the Alc\u00e1zar, and the city's many synagogues and mosques.\nToledo hosts numerous cultural events and festivals, such as Semana Santa (Holy Week) processions and the Corpus Christi festival, which draw large crowds and celebrate Castilian Spanish religious and cultural traditions.\nClimate.\nToledo has a typical cold semi-arid climate (K\u00f6ppen: \"BSk\"). Winters are cool, while summers are hot and dry. Precipitation is low and mainly concentrated in the period between mid-autumn and mid-spring. The highest temperature ever recorded in Toledo was on 13 August 2021; the lowest was on 12 January 2021.\nDemographics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Module:Historical populations/styles.css\"/&gt;\nEconomy.\nThe metal-working industry has historically been Toledo's economic base, with a great tradition in the manufacturing of swords and knives and a significant production of razor blades, medical devices, and electrical products. Soap and toothpaste industries, flour milling, glass, and ceramics have also been important.\nThe manufacture of swords in the city of Toledo goes back to Roman times, but it was under Moorish rule and during the Reconquista that Toledo and its guild of swordsmiths played a key role. Between the 15th and 17th centuries, the Toledo sword-making industry enjoyed a great boom, to the point where Toledo steel came to be regarded as the best in Europe. Swords and daggers were made by individual craftsmen, although the sword-makers guild oversaw their quality. In the late 17th and early 18th century, production began to decline, prompting the creation of the Royal Arms Factory in 1761 by order of King Charles III. The Royal Factory brought together all the sword-makers' guilds of the city and was located in the former mint. In 1777, recognizing the need to expand the space, Charles commissioned the architect Sabatini to construct a new building on the outskirts of the city. This was the beginning of several phases of expansion. Its importance was such that it eventually developed into a city within the city of Toledo.\nIn the 20th century, the production of knives and swords for the army was reduced to cavalry weapons only, and, after the Spanish Civil War, to the supply of swords to the officers and NCOs of the various military units. Following the closure of the factory in the 1980s, the building was renovated to house the campus of the Technological University of Castilla\u2013La Mancha in Toledo. According to the Statistical Institute of Castilla\u2013La Mancha, in 2007 the share of employment by sector was as follows: 86.5% of the population engaged in the services, 6.6% in construction, 5.4% in industry and 1.5% in agriculture and livestock.\nUnemployment.\nIn the decade up to 2008, unemployment in absolute terms remained fairly stable in the city of Toledo, but in 2009 this figure increased significantly: nearly 62% higher than 2008, with the number of unemployed rising from 2,515 to 4,074 (figures at 31 March each year), according to the Junta de Comunidades de Castilla La Mancha. Of this 62%, one-third of the increase took place in the first quarter.\nAccording to other statistics from the same source, almost half the unemployed in the city of Toledo (1,970 persons) are among those whose education does not go beyond the compulsory secondary level. However, there are groups whose level of studies is such that they have not been registered as unemployed, including those who have completed class 1 professional training, or those with virtually nonexistent unemployment rates (less than 0.1%), which is the case of the unemployed with high school degrees or professional expertise.\nThe largest group among the unemployed is those who have no qualifications (27.27%).\nPolitics.\nToledo has a 25-member City Council, elected by closed lists every four years. The 2023 election saw a pact between the 9 members of the People's Party and the 4 members of Vox, allowing Carlos Vel\u00e1zquez of the PP to become mayor, a position which had been held by the Socialists since 2007.\nCulture.\nThe old city is located on a mountaintop with a 150-degree view, surrounded on three sides by a bend in the Tagus River, and contains many historical sites, including the Alc\u00e1zar, the cathedral (the primate church of Spain), and the Zocodover, a central market place.\nFrom the 4th century to the 16th century, about thirty synods were held at Toledo. The earliest, directed against Priscillian, was assembled in 400. At the synod of 589, the Visigothic king Reccared declared his conversion from Arianism to Catholicism; the synod of 633 decreed uniformity of Catholic liturgy throughout the Visigothic Kingdom and took stringent measures against baptized Jews who had relapsed into their former faith. Other councils forbade circumcision, Jewish rites, and observance of the Sabbath and festivals. Throughout the seventh century, Jews were flogged, executed, had their property confiscated, were subjected to ruinous taxes, forbidden to trade, and, at times, dragged to the baptismal font. The council of 681 assured to the archbishop of Toledo the primacy of Spain. At Guadamur, very close to Toledo, the Treasure of Guarrazar was excavated in 1858, the best example of Visigothic art in Spain.\nAs nearly one hundred early canons of Toledo found a place in the \"Decretum Gratiani\", they exerted an important influence on the development of ecclesiastical law. The synod of 1565\u20131566 concerned itself with the execution of the decrees of the Council of Trent, and the last council held at Toledo, 1582\u20131583, was guided in detail by Philip II.\nToledo had large communities of Muslims and Jews until they were expelled from Spain in 1492 (Jews) and 1502 (Mud\u00e9jars). Today's city contains the religious monuments the Synagogue of Santa Mar\u00eda la Blanca, the Synagogue of El Tr\u00e1nsito, the Mosque of Cristo de la Luz and the Church of San Sebasti\u00e1n dating from before the expulsion, still maintained in good condition. Among Ladino-speaking Sephardi Jews, in their various diasporas, the family name Toledano is still prevalent, indicating ancestry from the city (the name is also attested among non-Jews in various Spanish-speaking countries).\nIn the 13th century, Toledo was a major cultural centre under the guidance of Alfonso X, known as \"El Sabio\" (\"the Wise\") for his love of learning. The Toledo School of Translators, established under Archbishop Raymond of Toledo, continued to bring vast stores of knowledge to Europe by rendering great academic and philosophical works in Arabic into Latin. The Palacio de Galiana, built in the Mud\u00e9jar style, is one of the monuments remaining from that period.\nThe Cathedral of Toledo (\"Catedral de Toledo\") was built between 1226 and 1493 and modeled after Bourges Cathedral, though it also combines some characteristics of the Mud\u00e9jar style. It is remarkable for its incorporation of light and features a Baroque altar called \"El Transparente\", several storeys high, with fantastic figures of stucco, paintings, bronze castings, and several colors of marble, a masterpiece of medieval mixed media by Narciso Tom\u00e9. For a few minutes every day, a shaft of light shines through, from which this feature of the cathedral derives its name. The Mozarabic Chapel in the Toledo Cathedral still uses the Mozarabic Rite and music. Two notable bridges secured access to Toledo across the Tagus, the Alc\u00e1ntara bridge and the later built San Mart\u00edn bridge.\nThe Monasterio de San Juan de los Reyes is a Franciscan monastery, built 1477\u20131504, in a remarkable combination of Gothic-Spanish-Flemish style with Mud\u00e9jar ornamentation.\nToledo was home to El Greco for the latter part of his life, and is the subject of some of his most famous paintings, including \"The Burial of the Count of Orgaz\", exhibited in the Church of Santo Tom\u00e9.\nWhen Philip II moved the royal court from Toledo to Madrid in 1561, the old city went into a slow decline from which it never recovered.\nToledo steel.\nToledo has been a traditional sword-making, steel-working centre since about 500 BCE, and came to the attention of Rome when used by Hannibal in the Punic Wars. Soon, it became a standard source of weaponry for Roman legions.\nToledo steel was famed for its very high quality alloy, whereas Damascene steel, a competitor from the Middle Ages on, was also famed for a specific metal-working technique.\nToday there is a significant trade, and many shops offer all kinds of swords to their customers, whether historical or modern swords used in films, as well as armor from the medieval period and other times, which are also exported to other countries.\nGastronomy.\nSome of the local specialties include lamb roast or stew, \"cochifrito\", \"alubias con perdiz\" (beans with partridge) and \"perdiz estofoda\" (partridge stew), \"carcamusa\", \"migas\", \"gachas manchegas\", and \"tortilla a la magra\". In addition, there are local versions of dishes from the nearby capital of Spain, Madrid, as is the case of the \"cocido toledano\". Two of the city's most famous food products are Manchego cheese and marzipan, which has a Protected Geographical Indication (\"mazap\u00e1n de Toledo\").\nHolidays.\nThe Virgen del Valle pilgrimage is celebrated on May 1 at the Ermita de la Virgen del Valle, a popular spot for visitors. Holy Week, which has been declared of National Tourist Interest, is marked in spring with various processions (including several on Good Friday) and religious and cultural events. The local feast of Corpus Christi has held the status of celebration of International Tourist Interest since 1980. It was conventionally celebrated 60 days after Resurrection Sunday. The celebration of Catholic feasts had its heyday during the Baroque, post-Trent period. A processional cortege travels around of streets and richly decorated awnings. The Virgen del Sagrario is celebrated on 15 August, featuring a procession inside the Cathedral and drinking water of the Virgin from jars. Labour Day celebrations begin on the night of April 30.\nMain sights.\nThe city of Toledo was declared a Historic-Artistic Site in 1940. UNESCO later gave the city the title of World Heritage in 1987. Sights include:\nTo mark the fourth centenary of the publication of the first part of \"Don Quixote\", the Council of Communities of Castilla\u2013La Mancha designed a series of routes through the region crossing various points cited in the novel. Known as the Route of Don Quixote, two of the designated pathways, sections 1 and 8, are based in Toledo; those linking the Castillian city with La Mancha and the Toledo Mountains take advantage of the natural route that passes through the Cigarrales and heads to Cobisa, Burguillos of Toledo and Nambroca, where it takes the Camino Real of Sevilla to suddenly turn towards Mascaraque Almonacid de Toledo, near Mora in La Mancha.\nThe Mascaraque-Toledo stretch of the Route of Don Quixote has recently been officially included in the Camino de Levante branch of the Camino de Santiago, starting in Valencia and passing through Alicante and Cartagena. Both routes on this stretch have been declared European Cultural Routes.\nTransport.\nToledo has long been an obligatory stop in the centre of the peninsula. The roads leading to historic Toledo are still used and in many cases have provided the basis for existing roads leading into the city.\nRoads.\nFrom Toledo, the N-400 links the city with Cuenca via Oca\u00f1a and Taranc\u00f3n. It is currently in the process of transformation into the future A-40 Castilla\u2013La Mancha motorway, which will link Maqueda (where it joins the Extremadura motorway), Toledo, Oca\u00f1a (where it attaches to the Motorway of Andalusia), Taranc\u00f3n (where it connects with the Levante motorway), Cuenca and Teruel.\nThe old 401 National Road (Madrid-Toledo-Ciudad Real) was transformed in the late 1980s into the current A-42 as a result of splitting and removing the road that the various crossings included (Illescas, Yuncos, etc.).\nThe split path extends up to south of Toledo, towards Ciudad Real, where it continues as a conventional road. At this point, the A-42 connects with the Highway of the Vineyard that goes as far as Tomelloso. There are plans to extend the A-42, by a toll road, to Ciudad Real and Ja\u00e9n.\nIn the early twenty-first century, the toll motorway AP-41 was built, in order to reduce traffic congestion between Toledo and Madrid.\nToledo is also part of the N-403, Toledo\u2013Maqueda\u2013\u00c1vila\u2013Adanero State Highway Network. Part of the route of this road will be replaced by that of the aforementioned Castilla\u2013La Mancha Highway.\nIn addition to these roads, several regional and provincial roads link the city with the regions of Montes de Toledo, La Jara, and La Mancha.\nRail.\nIn the mid-nineteenth century, Toledo was one of the first Spanish cities to receive rail service, with the arrival of the Madrid \u2013 Aranjuez line, which was inaugurated by Isabella II on June 12, 1858. The current Toledo Railway Station, (built in Neo-Mud\u00e9jar style), was opened on April 24, 1919.\nThe line suffered some technical issues and service disruptions but continued to serve as the main intercity route until the early twenty-first century. On July 2, 2003, the last conventional train service between the two capitals ended and work began on a high-speed link to Madrid, which entered service on November 15, 2005. The new line reduced the travel time to Madrid to just under 30 minutes.\nAir.\nThe nearest airport is Madrid\u2013Barajas Airport, located north east of Toledo.\nHealth.\nIn the early 1960s, construction of the \"Virgen de la Salud\" Social Security Health Residence began. The original building still remains in use, although successive extensions were added (maternity, outpatient clinics, operating rooms, etc.) to the existing complex. The complex was also extended to move the clinic to a new nearby building, now converted into the San Ildefonso Specialty Centre.\nThe National Hospital for Paraplegics, inaugurated on 7 October 1974, became a national centre for the treatment of spinal cord injuries. It also focuses on the social integration of patients.\nThe devolution of healthcare responsibilities to the Junta de Comunidades de Castilla\u2013La Mancha gave new impetus to the health infrastructure, demonstrated in 2007 when construction began on the new General Hospital of Toledo in Santa Mar\u00eda de Benquerencia. The different parts of the relevant health centres were also provided.\nThe Toledo Hospital Complex also features the integrated Geriatric Hospital Virgen del Valle, a result of reform and modernization of the old tuberculosis hospital built in the mid-twentieth century. The centre is located outside the city, near the Parador Nacional de Turismo Conde de Orgaz.\nThe city also has several private health centers, including Hospital de las Tres Culturas and Cl\u00ednica Nuestra Se\u00f1ora del Rosario.\nSport.\nToledo suffered from a shortage of sports facilities. Much of this problem was resolved when the Central School of Physical Education of the Army moved its headquarters to the premises of the Infantry Academy. In the 1990s, the city council took over the old facilities of the military centre, which now include an athletics track, Olympic swimming pool and an indoor sports hall, numerous outdoor courts built in the area of the former runway, having been demolished, and the old gym complex pools (indoor and outdoor).\nBesides these facilities, the city of Toledo has sports pavilions in the districts of Santa Mar\u00eda de Benquerencia, Santa B\u00e1rbara, San Ant\u00f3n (Complejo Deportivo), outdoor pools in Azucaica, Palomarejos, Santa Mar\u00eda de Benquerencia, Santa Barbara and Santa Teresa and indoor swimming pools in the gardens of the Alc\u00e1zar (old town), Santa Mar\u00eda de Benquerencia and San Antonio.\nToledo has a football team, CD Toledo, founded on 24 April 1928. Their home turf is the Estadio Salto del Caballo, inaugurated on 23 November 1973. The team played for 7 seasons in the Segunda Divisi\u00f3n, during which it reached the play-off final for promotion to La Liga at the end of the 1993\u201394 season, losing 4\u20131 on aggregate to Real Valladolid. Toledo players have included Abel Resino, Luis Garc\u00eda, former Arsenal coach Unai Emery, Rufete and Casquero. In the 2024\u201325 season, CD Toledo will play in the Tercera Federaci\u00f3n, the fifth tier of Spanish football.\nToledo has two basketball teams: CB CEI Toledo, with a long history of mixed success in both regional and national leagues (EBA) and has just been promoted to 1st Autonomic, and CB Pol\u00edgono, whose male team was promoted to the EBA League for the 2009/10 season, seven years after relegation. This club is based in the Santa Mar\u00eda de Benquerencia district and has one of the largest youth systems in Castilla\u2013La Mancha.\nToledo has been represented in athletics since 2 April 1979 by the Toledo Athletic Club, which is characterised mainly by its success in cross-country, winning a large number of medals in the Spanish championships, in addition to its (male and female) athletes who competed in the 1st division of the national track league in the late 1990s. Among the athletes who have passed through its lanes are Julio Rey, Roberto Parra, Chema Martinez and Julia Lobato.\nSince the victory of Federico Bahamontes, 'The Eagle of Toledo', in the 1959 Tour de France, cycling has been one of the most popular sports in the city. At present, however, no school in Santa Mar\u00eda de Benquerencia has a velodrome. Other leading professional cyclists from the city include Nemesio Jim\u00e9nez, who competed at the 1968 Mexico City Olympics, and \u00c1ngel de las Heras.\nThe volleyball club Voleibol Asociaci\u00f3n Toledo plays in the National First Division, while the popular Toledo Rugby Club competes in the Madrid league system.\nAt the individual level, the swimmer Javier Noriega and the marathon runner Julio Rey competed in both 2004 Athens Olympics and 2008 Beijing Olympics. Rey, the current Spanish marathon record holder (2 hours, 6 minutes, and 52 seconds) announced his retirement in October 2009.\nMedia.\nVarious local and provincial newspapers are published in the city. In addition, national newspapers such as the daily ABC publish unique local editions. Among the local newspapers are the subscription-based La Tribuna de Toledo and El D\u00eda de Toledo, as well as the free Global Castilla\u2013La Mancha and Toledo News. The general information weekly magazines \"Echoes\" and Here are also published.\nThere is also local media on television, radio, and the Internet. CMM TV, the regional public television, is headquartered in Toledo. In addition, there are several local television stations: Canal Diocesano-Popular TV and Teletoledo.\nAs regards radio stations, there is Radio Toledo (Onda Cero), as well as COPE, Cadena SER, RNE, RCM, and Radio Aqu\u00ed, and the local Onda Pol\u00edgono and the diocesan station Radio Santa Maria. In digital and social media: Onda Toledo, Toledo Digital, and La Cerca.\nTwin towns \u2013 sister cities.\nToledo is twinned with:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "31361", "revid": "50680571", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31361", "title": "Tristan da Cunha", "text": "Group of islands in the South Atlantic\nTristan da Cunha (), colloquially Tristan, is a remote group of volcanic islands in the South Atlantic Ocean. It is one of three constituent parts of the British Overseas Territory of Saint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha, with its own constitution.\nThe territory consists of the inhabited island Tristan da Cunha, which has a diameter of roughly and an area of ; the wildlife reserves of Gough Island and Inaccessible Island; and the smaller, uninhabited Nightingale Islands. As of October 2018[ [update]], the main island had 250\u00a0permanent inhabitants, who all hold British Overseas Territories citizenship. The other islands are uninhabited, except for the South African personnel of a weather station on Gough Island.\nAs there is no airstrip on the island, the only way of travelling to or from Tristan is by ship. There are six-day journeys from Cape Town, South Africa, and some cruises offered departing from Ushuaia, Argentina.\nHistory.\nDiscovery.\nThe islands were first recorded as sighted in 1506 by Portuguese explorer Trist\u00e3o da Cunha, though rough seas prevented a landing. He believed them to be uninhabited, and named the main island after himself, . It was later anglicised from its earliest mention on British Admiralty charts to Tristan da Cunha Island. Some sources state that the Portuguese made the first landing in 1520, when \"L\u00e1s Rafael\", captained by Ruy Vaz Pereira, called at Tristan for water.\nThe first undisputed landing was made on 7\u00a0February 1643 by the crew of the Dutch East India Company ship \"Heemstede,\" captained by Claes Gerritsz Bierenbroodspot. The Dutch stopped at the island four more times in the next 25years, and in 1656 created the first rough charts of the archipelago.\nThe first full survey of the archipelago was made by the crew of the French corvette \"Heure du Berger\" in 1767. The first scientific exploration was conducted by French naturalist Louis-Marie Aubert du Petit-Thouars, who stayed on the island for three days in January 1793, during a French mercantile expedition from Brest, France, to Mauritius. Thouars made botanical collections and reported traces of human habitation, including fireplaces and overgrown gardens, probably left by Dutch explorers in the 17th\u00a0century.\nOn his voyage out from Europe to East Africa and India in command of the Imperial Asiatic Company of Trieste and Antwerp ship, \"Joseph and Theresa\", William Bolts sighted Tristan da Cunha, put a landing party ashore on 2\u00a0February 1777 and hoisted the Imperial flag, naming it and its neighbouring islets the Brabant Islands. However, no settlement or facilities were ever set up there by the company.\nAfter the outbreak of the American Revolutionary War halted penal transportation to the Thirteen Colonies, British prisons started to overcrowd. As several stopgap measures proved to be ineffective, the British Government announced in December\u00a01785 that it would proceed with the settlement of New South Wales. In September\u00a01786 Alexander Dalrymple, presumably goaded by Bolts's actions, published a pamphlet with an alternative proposal of his own for settlements on Tristan da Cunha, St.\u00a0Paul and Amsterdam islands in the Southern Ocean.\nCaptain John Blankett, R.N., also suggested independently to his superiors in August\u00a01786 that convicts be used to establish a British settlement on Tristan. In consequence, the Admiralty received orders from the government in October 1789 to examine the island as part of a general survey of the South Atlantic and the coasts of southern Africa. That did not happen, but an investigation of Tristan, Amsterdam and St. Paul was undertaken in December\u00a01792 and January\u00a01793 by George Macartney, Britain's first ambassador to China. During his voyage to China, he established that none of the islands were suitable for settlement.\n19th century.\nThe first permanent settler was Jonathan Lambert of Salem, Massachusetts, United States, who arrived in December\u00a01810 with two other men, later joined by a fourth. Lambert declared the islands his property and named them the \"Islands of Refreshment\". Three of the four men died in 1812, leaving Thomas Currie (Tommaso Corri, from Livorno, Italy) as the sole survivor, who remained as a farmer on the island.\nOn 14\u00a0August\u00a01816, the United Kingdom annexed the islands by dispatching a garrison to secure possession, making them a dependency of the Cape Colony in South Africa. This was intended to prevent the islands' use as a base for any attempt to free Napoleon Bonaparte from his imprisonment on Saint Helena. The occupation also deterred the United States from using Tristan da Cunha as a base for naval cruisers, as it had during the War of 1812. The garrison departed in November\u00a01817, though some members, notably William Glass, stayed and formed the nucleus of a permanent population.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n\"On the fifteenth of July, the snow-clad mountains of Tristan da Cunha appeared, lighted by a brilliant morning-sun, and towering to a height estimated at between nine and ten thousand feet.\"\n Edmund Roberts, \"Embassy to the Eastern Courts of Cochin-China, Siam, and Muscat\" (1837)\nThe artist Augustus Earle was stranded on Tristan da Cunha for eight months in 1824. His ship, the aging \"Duke of Gloucester\", anchored there due to a storm and sailed without him and a crew member. Earle tutored local children and painted until his supplies ran out, before being rescued in November by en route to Hobart.\nBy 1824, a small civilian community had developed alongside the British Marines' garrison. When stopped there on 25\u00a0March\u00a01824, it reported twenty-two men and three women. The barque \"South Australia\" visited between 18 and 20\u00a0February\u00a01836, when a Mr.\u00a0Glass was described as the settlement\u2019s governor. That same year, the schooner \"Emily\" was wrecked there; one survivor, Dutch fisherman Pieter Groen from Katwijk, remained, married, and changed his name to Peter Green. He later became spokesman (governor) of the community in 1865. By 1856, the population had grown to 97 residents.\nA resident parson arrived in February\u00a01851, and the Bishop of Cape Town visited in March\u00a01856, formally including Tristan within the Diocese of Cape Town.\nIn 1867, Prince Alfred, Duke of Edinburgh, second son of Queen Victoria, visited the islands. The only settlement was renamed Edinburgh of the Seven Seas in his honour. On 15\u00a0October\u00a01873, the Royal Navy survey vessel HMS \"Challenger\" called at Tristan to conduct geographic and zoological surveys on the island group. Captain George Nares recorded fifteen families and eighty-six inhabitants at that time. Tristan became a dependency of the British Crown in October\u00a01875.\nWhalers established bases on the islands during the mid-19th century, but the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869 and the transition from sail to coal-fired steamships increased Tristan\u2019s isolation. The islands were no longer needed as a stopover point for long sailing voyages or as a haven on routes from Europe to East Asia.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nVictims of the 1885 Lifeboat Disaster:\nOn 27\u00a0November\u00a01885, the island suffered one of its worst tragedies when the iron barque \"West Riding\", en route from Bristol to Sydney, approached the island. Because trading opportunities were rare, almost all able-bodied men launched a lifeboat to trade with the ship despite rough seas. The lifeboat, recently donated by the British government, was last seen sailing alongside the \"West Riding\" before disappearing. Reports varied\u2014some claimed the men drowned, while others speculated they were taken to Australia and sold as slaves. Fifteen men were lost, leaving behind an island of widows. A plaque in St\u00a0Mary\u2019s Church commemorates the tragedy.\n20th century.\nHard winter of 1906.\nAfter years of hardship since the 1880s and an especially difficult winter in 1906, the British government offered to evacuate the island in 1907. The Tristanians held a meeting and decided to refuse, despite the government's warning that it could not promise further help in the future.\nOccasional pre-war visits.\nNo ships called at the islands from 1909 until 1919, when HMS \"Yarmouth\" stopped to inform the islanders of the outcome of World War I.\nThe Shackleton\u2013Rowett Expedition stopped in Tristan for five days in May\u00a01922, collecting geological and botanical samples before returning to Cape Town. Among the few ships that visited in the coming years were the RMS \"Asturias\", a Royal Mail Steam Packet Company passenger liner, in 1927, and the Canadian Pacific ocean liners RMS \"Empress of France\" in 1928, in 1929, and RMS \"Empress of Australia\" in 1935.\nIn 1936, \"The Daily Telegraph\" of London reported that the population of the island was 167\u00a0people, with 185\u00a0cattle and 42\u00a0horses.\nFrom December\u00a01937 to March\u00a01938, a Norwegian party made a dedicated scientific expedition to Tristan da Cunha, and sociologist Peter A. Munch extensively documented island culture; he visited the island again in 1964\u20131965. The island was also visited in 1938 by W. Robert Foran, reporting for the National Geographic Society. His account was published that same year.\nOn 12\u00a0January 1938 by letters patent, Britain declared the islands a dependency of Saint Helena, creating the British Crown Colony of Saint Helena and Dependencies, which also included Ascension Island.\nWorld War II military development.\nDuring the Second World War, Tristan was commissioned by the Royal Navy as the so-called \"stone frigate\" and used as a secret signals intelligence station, to monitor German U-boats (which were required to maintain radio contact) and shipping in the South Atlantic Ocean. The weather and radio stations led to extensive new infrastructure being built on the island, including a school, a hospital, and a cash-based general store.\nThe first colonial official sent to rule the island was Sir Hugh Elliott in the rank of administrator (because the settlement was too small to merit a governor) 1950\u20131953. Development continued as the island's first canning factory expanded paid employment in 1949.\nRare post-war ship visits.\nPrince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, the Queen's consort, visited the islands in 1957 as part of a world tour on board the royal yacht HMY \"Britannia\".\nOn 2 January 1954, Tristan da Cunha was visited by the Dutch ship \"Willem Ruys\", a passenger-cargo liner, carrying science fiction writer Robert A. Heinlein, his wife Ginny and other passengers. The \"Ruys\" was travelling from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, to Cape Town, South Africa. The visit is described in Heinlein's book \"Tramp Royale\". The captain told Heinlein the island was the most isolated inhabited spot on Earth and ships rarely visited. Heinlein mailed a letter from there to L. Ron Hubbard, a friend who also liked to travel, \"for the curiosity value of the postmark\". Biographer William H. Patterson Jr. in his two volume \"Robert A. Heinlein In Dialogue with his Century\", wrote that lack of \"cultural context\" made it \"nearly impossible to converse\" with the islanders, \"a stark contrast with the way they had managed to chat with strangers\" while travelling in South America. Members of the crew bought penguins during their brief visit to the island.\n1961 eruption of Queen Mary's Peak.\nOn 10 October 1961, the eruption of a parasitic cone of Queen Mary's Peak, very close to Edinburgh of the Seven Seas, forced evacuation of all 264\u00a0people. The evacuees took to the water in open boats, taken by the local lobster-fishing boats \"Tristania\" and \"Frances Repetto\" to uninhabited Nightingale Island.\nThe next day, they were picked up by the diverted Dutch passenger ship \"Tjisadane\" that took them to Cape Town. The islanders later arrived in the U.K. aboard the liner M.V. \"Stirling Castle\" to a big press reception and, after a short period at Pendell Army Camp in Merstham, Surrey, were settled in an old Royal Air Force camp near Calshot, Hampshire.\nThe following year, a Royal Society expedition reported that Edinburgh of the Seven Seas had survived. Most families returned in 1963.\nGough and Inaccessible Islands wildlife reserves.\nGough Island was inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1995 as Gough Island Wildlife Reserve. This was further extended in 2004 as Gough and Inaccessible Islands, with its marine zone extended from 3 to 12\u00a0nautical miles.\nThese islands have been Ramsar sites \u2013 wetlands of international importance \u2013 since 20\u00a0November 2008.\n21st century.\nOn 23\u00a0May 2001, the islands were hit by an extratropical cyclone that generated winds up to . A number of structures were severely damaged, and numerous cattle were killed, prompting emergency aid provided by the British government.\nIn 2005, the islands were given a United Kingdom post code (TDCU 1ZZ), to make it easier for the residents to order goods online.\nOn 13\u00a0February 2008, a fire destroyed the island's four power generators and fish canning factory, severely disrupting the economy. On 14\u00a0March 2008, new generators were installed and power restored, and a new factory opened in July\u00a02009. While the replacement factory was built, M/V \"Kelso\" came to the island as a factory ship. The St.\u00a0Helena, Ascension, and Tristan da Cunha Constitution Order 2009 reorganized Tristan da Cunha as a constituent of the new British Overseas Territory of Saint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha, giving Tristan and Ascension equal status with Saint Helena.\nOn 16\u00a0March 2011, the freighter ran aground on Nightingale Island, spilling tons of heavy fuel oil into the ocean. The resulting oil slick threatened the island's population of rockhopper penguins. Nightingale Island has no fresh water, so the penguins were transported to Tristan da Cunha for cleaning.\nOn 13 November 2020, it was announced that the of the waters surrounding the islands will become a Marine Protection Zone. The move will make the zone the largest no-take zone in the Atlantic and the fourth largest on the planet. The move follows 20 years of conservation work by the RSPB and the island government and five years of the UK government's Blue Belt programme support.\nA total solar eclipse will pass over the island on 5\u00a0December 2048. The island is calculated to be on the centre line of the umbra's path for nearly three and a half minutes of totality.\nGeography.\nTristan da Cunha is thought to have been formed by a long-lived centre of upwelling mantle called the Tristan hotspot. Tristan da Cunha is the main island of the Tristan da Cunha archipelago, which consists of the following islands:\nInaccessible Island and the Nightingale Islands are SW by W and SSW away from the main island, respectively, whereas Gough Island is SSE.\nThe main island is generally mountainous. The only flat area is on the north-west coast, which is the location of the only settlement, Edinburgh of the Seven Seas, and the agricultural area of Potato Patches. The highest point is the summit of a volcano called Queen Mary's Peak at an elevation of , high enough to develop snow cover in winter. The other islands of the group are uninhabited, except for a weather station with a staff of six on Gough Island, which has been operated by South Africa since 1956 and has been at its present location at Transvaal Bay on the southeast coast since 1963.\nClimate.\nThe archipelago has a Cfb, wet oceanic climate, under the K\u00f6ppen system, with mild temperatures and very limited sunshine but consistent moderate-to-heavy rainfall due to the persistent westerly winds. Under the Trewartha classification, Tristan da Cunha has a humid subtropical climate due to the lack of cold weather. The number of rainy days is comparable to the Aleutian Islands at a much higher latitude in the northern hemisphere, while sunshine hours are comparable to Juneau, Alaska, 20\u00b0 farther from the equator. Frost is unknown below elevations of , and summer temperatures are similarly mild, never reaching . Sandy Point on the east coast is reputed to be the warmest and driest place on the island, being in the lee of the prevailing winds.\nGeology.\nTristan, along with its neighbouring islands, lies about 400\u00a0km east of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. The volcanic activity is unrelated to the Mid-Atlantic Ridge; rather, it is due to a hotspot.\nThe steep central cone (The Peak) predominantly is composed of pyroclastic deposits erupted from the central vent. The Base and Main Cliffs are composed mainly of thin basaltic lava flows, commonly separated by thin pyroclastic layers. There are over 30 cinder cones on the flanks of the main volcano, many of which have produced small lava flows. The October 1961 eruption was preceded by earthquake swarms and rock falls from the Main Cliffs, then lava was erupted on the plain immediately east of the settlement. The growing lava mound breached and lava flows were erupted toward the coast. As the eruption waned, an elongate lava dome grew and sealed the vent.\nInaccessible Island, 35\u00a0km southwest of Tristan, is the relic of an older volcanic cone. Most of the island is composed of basaltic lava flows, but the southwestern part of Inaccessible has numerous trachyte domes and flows.\nNightingale Island, and nearby Middle and Stoltenhoff Islands, are 34\u00a0km south-southwest of Tristan. Nightingale mostly is composed of trachyte domes and flows, with some pyroclastic deposits. Middle Island is entirely composed of pyroclastic deposits (intruded by dykes), whereas Stoltenhoff Island is entirely composed of trachyte.\nThe island is located in the South Atlantic Anomaly, an area of the Earth with an abnormally weak magnetic field. On 14\u00a0November 2008 a geomagnetic observatory was inaugurated on the island as part of a joint venture between the Danish Meteorological Institute and DTU Space.\nVolcanoes.\nTristan da Cunha has two volcanoes: Queen Mary's Peak on the main island and Edinburgh Peak on Gough Island. Queen Mary's Peak () has a height of and remains active, with its last eruption reported to have occurred in 1961. Edinburgh Peak () has a height of and is classified as extinct.\nGeochemistry and tectonic significance.\nThe volcanic rocks range from ankaramitic basanite through tephrite to phonolite and some have ultra-potassic compositions, which is unusual for rocks that erupted close to the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. They exemplify the EM1 pole in compilations of isotopic compositions of mantle-derived rocks. The unusual composition is explained by the presence of enriched material in the plume source, either recycled sediments or metasomatized lithosphere. The origin of the islands is commonly attributed to partial melting in a mantle plume. The islands are located at the western end of the Walvis Ridge, which links the islands to the Etendeka large igneous province. This association has been cited as an example of plume head and tail hypothesis, but the geochemical characteristics of Tristan lavas differ from those of the Etendeka province, which suggests that the plume was heterogeneous.\nFlora and fauna.\nMany of the flora and fauna of the archipelago have a broad circumpolar distribution in the South Atlantic and South Pacific Oceans. For example, the plant species \"Nertera granadensis\" was first collected in Tristan da Cunha, but has since been recorded as far away as New Zealand.\nInvasive species.\nThe islands of Tristan da Cunha have a high significance of global biodiversity: two of them, Gough and Inaccessible, form a UNESCO natural World Heritage Site. This designation is largely due to the seabird population found there. The biodiversity of the island is vulnerable to introduction of invasive species. Due to Tristan da Cunha's isolated archipelago ecology, and increase of tourism with cruise ships and research vessels, invasive species are a particular concern for Tristan da Cunha. The islands' vegetation and mammal species are not equipped to defend against or control introduced species, increasing island vulnerability, due to lack of defensive behavioural mechanisms and slow generational output rates. Efforts to decrease and eradicate invasive flora, fauna, and marine species have been undertaken, including a programme aimed at eradicating predatory invasive mice on Gough Island.\nInvasive house mice on these islands have adapted to be 50% larger than average house mice. They are thought to have been accidentally introduced by 19th-century seal hunters who would dock on the islands. These mice have adapted by consuming sea bird eggs and chicks (as they nest on the ground). Gathering at night in groups of 9 or 10, the mice gather at the bird's nest to feast. With no natural predators, the invasive mice population is able to expand by producing new generations twice a year.\nIn order to prevent the growth of the invasive mice population and extinction of the Albatross bird species, a 2019 Gough Island mouse eradication project was announced (Grundy, 2018). The RSPB and Tristan da Cunha Government have partnered to spread cereal pellets with rodenticide bait across Gough Island, in hopes to eradicate the invasive mice population. The goal of this operation is to restore Tristan da Cunha to its natural state, ensuring it will still be one of the world's most important seabird nesting sites.\nFlora.\nNative plants.\nA combination of the list on Kew's \"Plants of the World Online\" site with information from a paper by Wace and Holdgate yields the following list (by no means exhaustive) of plant species recorded as native to Tristan da Cunha.\nIntroduced plants.\nTristan da Cunha acquired an estimated 137 non-native vascular plants that can be categorized into four species types; weeds (trees, shrubs, agricultural weeds), grassland species (grasses), garden escapes (vegetables), and other ruderal species. Vascular plants were accidentally introduced in a variety of ways including: impurities in flower or vegetable seeds; seeds or plant fragments from other imported plants; and in soil, attached to containers, cars or people. The majority of invasive weed species that have been introduced to the island are spread by seed and cover 50% of arable land in widely distributed patches. These species include prickly sow-thistle (\"Sonchus asper\"), smooth sow-thistle (\"Sonchus oleraceus\"), smooth hawksbeard (\"Crepis capillaris\"), scrambling fumitory (\"Fumaria muralis\"), green field speedwell (\"Veronica agrestis\"), groundsel (\"Senecio vulgaris\"), and nutgrass (\"Cyperus esculentus\"). Other invasive weed species that have a more localized distribution in plots include prickly sow-thistle (\"Sonchus asper\"), smooth sow-thistle (\"Sonchus oleraceus\"), smooth hawksbeard (\"Crepis capillaris\"), and groundsel (\"Senecio vulgaris\"). Whether a species is distributed locally or widely depends on the seed's dispersal mechanisms; larger seeds that have not adapted to wind dispersal will be distributed locally, while smaller seeds that have adapted to wind dispersal will be widely distributed.\nThe invasive plants have had several negative impacts on native island plant species, including the competitive exclusion of many such species. The out-competition can and will alter the structure of plant communities and the quality of the islands' soil. Introduced vegetation has altered long-term carbon storage as well as the reduction of CO2 in the atmosphere. Native plants such as fern bushes, \"Phylica\" bushes, fern brakes, mires, and bogs, contain high organic content matter which functions as storage for carbon. With the introduction of harmful species, the islands will see a decrease in carbon storage of both the soil and vegetation. With multiple changes occurring within the soil due to invasive plant species, the nutrient cycle is bound to be negatively influenced. Invasive plants are also affecting the human population of Tristan da Cunha by being disease carriers and becoming agricultural pests in gardens and pastures.\nThe alien plants are able to survive and continue to grow and spread successfully on the islands because they have the ability to naturalize in temperate regions and have limited necessities needed to survive. The islands' isolation increases archipelago ecology uniqueness, which increases susceptibility to foreign invaders. A small human population with minimal development encourages flora and fauna development within a limited food web, which increases the invasive species' abilities for self-defense.\nPlants are being controlled by taking surveys of the invasive species, evaluating their impact on biodiversity, and evaluating the feasibility of their eradication. It would be nearly impossible to try and eradicate all invasive plant species, so scientists are narrowing down to control particular species based on their impact and feasibility to eradicate. Mitigation plans that are taking place on Tristan are time-consuming and labour-intensive and will take several years using mechanical and chemical procedures.\nFauna.\nLand.\nTristan is primarily known for its wildlife. The island has been identified as an Important Bird Area by BirdLife International because there are 13 known species of breeding seabirds on the island and two species of resident land birds. The seabirds include northern rockhopper penguins, Atlantic yellow-nosed albatrosses, sooty albatrosses, Atlantic petrels, great-winged petrels, soft-plumaged petrels, broad-billed prions, grey petrels, great shearwaters, sooty shearwaters, Tristan skuas, Antarctic terns and brown noddies. Tristan and Gough Islands are the only known breeding sites in the world for the Atlantic petrel. Inaccessible Island is also the only known breeding ground of the spectacled petrel. The Tristan albatross is known to breed only on Gough and Inaccessible Islands: all nest on Gough, except for one or two pairs which nest on Inaccessible Island.\nThe endemic Tristan thrush, also known as the \"starchy\", occurs on all of the northern islands and each has its own subspecies, with Tristan birds being slightly smaller and duller than those on Nightingale and Inaccessible. The endemic Inaccessible Island rail, the smallest extant flightless bird in the world, is found only on Inaccessible Island. The Tristan Moorhen was an endemic species to Tristan, but is now extinct. In 1956, eight Gough moorhens were released at Sandy Point on Tristan and have subsequently colonised the island.\nMarine.\nThe largest no take zone in the Atlantic, and at , the fourth largest in the world, was designated on 13\u00a0November 2020. The Marine Protected Area bans mining and fishing (except the local lobster fishery), with enforcement the responsibility of the UK government via satellite surveillance. According to the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB), the islands and surrounding ocean is one of the most pristine temperate ecosystems on the planet.\nVarious species of whales and dolphins can be seen around Tristan from time to time with increasing sighting rates, although recovery of baleen whales, especially the southern right whale, were severely hindered by illegal whaling by the Soviet Union in the aftermath of the 1960 volcanic eruption. The subantarctic fur seal (\"Arctophoca tropicalis\") can also be found in the Tristan archipelago, mostly on Gough Island.\nThe biodiversity of marine life is limited given the islands' isolation, making identifying the impacts of invasion difficult. While much of the marine life is unknown, there has been an invasive species identified in the waters around the islands. This species is the South American silver porgy (\"Diplodus argenteus argenteus\"), which is thought to have sought refuge in the area due to the wreck of an oil platform off the coast of Tristan in 2006. The silver porgy is omnivorous, but is not linked to the consumption of the valued lobster populations that the islanders fish. The silver porgy is however suspected to be consuming components of the islands' fragile kelp forest. The giant kelp forests of \"Macrocystis pyrifera\" are extremely limited in biodiversity and have a simple, short-chain food web. While this species is considered non-native and invasive, removal efforts are currently not prioritized. Continued monitoring is suggested, and expedition research for all invasive marine species is ongoing.\nEconomy.\nThe island has a unique social and economic structure in which all resident families farm and all land is communally owned. Outsiders are prohibited from buying land or settling on Tristan. Besides subsistence agriculture, major industries are commercial fishing and government. Major export industries are the Tristan rock lobster (\"Jasus\") fishery, the sale of the island's postage stamps and coins, and limited tourism. When the UK left the EU, Tristan da Cunha lost its membership in the EU's Overseas Countries and Territories Association.\nThe Bank of Saint Helena was established on Saint Helena and Ascension Island in 2004. This bank does not have a physical presence on Tristan da Cunha, but residents of Tristan are entitled to its services. Although Tristan da Cunha is part of the same overseas territory as Saint Helena, it does not use the local Saint Helena pound; sterling is used directly instead.\nTransport.\nThe remote location of the islands makes transport to the outside world difficult. Tristan da Cunha has no airstrip and is not generally accessible to air travel, though the wider territory is served by Saint Helena Airport and RAF Ascension Island. Boats sailing from South Africa provide transport service to the islands with ten voyages per year.\nThe RMS \"St Helena\" used to connect the main island to St\u00a0Helena and South Africa once each year during its January voyage, but has done so only a few times in the last years \u2013 in 2006, in 2011, and most recently in 2018. In the same year the RMS \"St Helena\" was withdrawn from service. Three ships, the MV \"Lance\", the MFV \"Edinburgh\", and the SA \"Agulhas II\", regularly service Tristan da Cunha from Cape Town, with typically fewer than a dozen visits a year. Other vessels may occasionally visit the island. The harbour at Edinburgh of the Seven Seas is called Calshot Harbour, named after the place in Hampshire, England, where the islanders temporarily stayed during the 1961\u20131963 Queen Mary's Peak volcanic eruption.\nTourism.\nTristan da Cunha has a very small tourism industry. As the island can only be reached from Cape Town in rough seas on vessels with limited vacancies, a trip must be planned months in advance, and only after a visit request is approved by the Island Council.\nOccasional boats or cruises may include a short visit to the island in their itinerary, but as there is no deep harbour, setting ashore is highly dependent on the maritime conditions. All visitors staying on Tristan must have a confirmed and fully paid return ticket, health insurance to include cover in case of medical evacuation to Cape Town, and sufficient funds to cover their entire stay. There are no hotels on the island. A visitor can rent a guest house (catered or self-catering) or stay in a private home on a full-board basis. There is a Tourism Post Office that sells souvenirs that might take months to arrive if ordered online.\nThe Tristan Government has a public website. It includes an online shop, a list of recent news about and on the island, and a simple online tour.\nCommunications.\nTelecommunication.\nThe ITU has assigned telephone country code +290 for Tristan da Cunha; however, residents have access to the Foreign and Commonwealth Office Telecommunications Network, provided by Global Crossing. This service uses a London 020 numbering range, meaning that numbers are accessed via the UK telephone numbering plan. Satellite-delivered internet access arrived in Tristan da Cunha in 1998, but its high cost initially made it almost unaffordable for the local population, who primarily used it only to send e\u2011mail. The connection was also extremely unreliable, connecting through a 64\u00a0kbit/s satellite phone connection provided by Inmarsat. On 16 September 2024, satellite internet via StarLink was made available on the island, offering much higher speeds than previously available.\nSince 2006, a very-small-aperture terminal has provided bandwidth for government purposes that is also made available via an internet caf\u00e9 and (after office hours) via Wi-Fi to island homes. As of 2016[ [update]], there is not yet any mobile telephone coverage on the islands.\nThe Government and Tristan da Cunha Association jointly run the island official website with all practical information, news, and facts about the island. While the site is updated from mainland UK, due to slow internet, the photos taken and uploaded from Tristan da Cunha are all in low resolution, which allows online navigation in the territory with acceptable speed.\nAmateur radio.\nAmateur radio operator groups sometimes conduct DX-peditions on the island. One group operated as station ZD9ZS in September\u2013October\u00a02014.\nGovernment.\nThere are no political parties or trade unions on Tristan. Executive authority is vested in the King, who is represented in the territory by the governor of Tristan da Cunha. Prior to 2009, Tristan da Cunha was a dependency of Saint Helena, and therefore directly represented by the governor of Saint Helena. The \"St Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha Constitution Order 2009\" made Saint Helena, Ascension Island, and Tristan da Cunha equal constituent parts of the territory with their own governments, and established the position of Governor of Tristan da Cunha. Per Section 208 of the Constitution Order, the person appointed as Governor of Saint Helena is \"ex officio\" Governor of Tristan da Cunha. However, as Tristan da Cunha is away from Saint Helena, an Administrator of Tristan da Cunha is appointed to act as the governor's representative on the island.\nThis arrangement predates the current constitutional structure, and the first administrator was appointed in the 1940s. Previously, the administrator also acted as the local magistrate, but the appointment is to be transferred to a non-member of the executive or legislative branches of government. The administrator is a career civil servant in the Foreign Office, selected by London, who acts as the local head of government and takes advice from the Tristan da Cunha Island Council. Since 1998, each administrator has usually served a three-year term (which begins in September, upon arrival of the supply ship from Cape Town). Fiona Kilpatrick and Stephen Townsend were exceptions to this rule, having taken up their job-share office in January 2020.\nThe Administrator and Island Council work from the Government Building, which is the only two-story building on the island. The building is sometimes referred to as \"Whitehall\" or the \"H'admin Building\" and contains the Administrator's Office, Treasury Department, Administration Offices, and the Council Chamber where Island Council meetings are held. Policing is undertaken by one full-time police inspector and three special constables. Tristan da Cunha has some legislation of its own, but the law of Saint Helena applies generally to the extent that it is not inconsistent with local law, insofar as it is suitable for local circumstances and subject to such modifications as local circumstances make necessary.\nChief Islander.\nThe Island Council is made up of eight elected and three appointed members, who serve a three-year term beginning in February or March. A separate but simultaneous vote is held to select the Chief Islander, who is the community's political leader. Ian Lavarello was elected to the position in March, 2025.\nDemographics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Module:Historical populations/styles.css\"/&gt;\nTristan da Cunha recorded a population of 243 in the June 2021 census. The only settlement is Edinburgh of the Seven Seas (known locally as \"The Settlement\"). The current residents are thought to have descended from fifteen outside ancestors, eight male and seven female, who arrived on the island at various dates between 1816 and 1908. The men were European, and the women were mixed race. Now all of the population has mixed ancestry. In addition, a male contributor of eastern European / Russian descent arrived in the early 1900s. In 1963, when families returned after the evacuation due to the 1961 volcanic eruption, the 200\u00a0settlers included four Tristan da Cunha women who brought with them new English husbands.\n \nThe female descendants have been traced by genetic study to five female founders, believed to be mixed-race (African, Asian, and European descent) and from Saint Helena. The historical data recounted that there were two pairs of sisters, but the mtDNA evidence showed only one pair of sisters.\nThe early male founders originated from Scotland, England, the Netherlands, the United States, and Italy, who belonged to three Y-haplogroups: I\u00a0(M170), R-SRY10831.2, and R\u00a0(M207) (xSRY10831.2). The male founders shared seven surnames: Glass, Green, Hagan, Lavarello, Repetto, Rogers, and Swain. The surnames Collins, Squibb, and Patterson were brought to the island by Tristanian women, returning with their English husbands from the evacuation of the early 1960s. The surnames Collins and Squibb continue to be used on the island. In addition, a new haplotype was found that is associated with men from Eastern Europe and Russia. It entered the population in the early 1900s, at a time when the island was visited by Russian sailing ships. There is \"evidence for the contribution of a hidden ancestor who left his genes, but not his name, on the island.\" Another four instances of non-paternity were found among male descendants, but researchers believed their fathers were probably among the early island population.\nThere are eighty families on the island. Like many remote island communities, Tristan da Cunha has a shrinking, ageing population. In the past, Tristan da Cunha mothers had to travel to Cape Town to give birth, but since the opening of the Camogli Healthcare Centre in 2017 have been able to give birth on the island.\nLanguage.\nPhonetics and phonology.\nTristan da Cunha English, also locally called Tristanian, is spoken on the isolated island in the South Atlantic. It is the smallest and most isolated native-speaker community of English. It is a form of South Atlantic English, and shares similarities with Saint Helenian English. Tristanian has several notable unique phonetic and phonological characteristics, such as the following.\nGrammar.\nTristan da Cunha English shares non-standard grammatical features with other English varieties in the Falkland Islands and St. Helena. Among its features:\nEducation.\nChildren leave school at age 16, and although they can take GCSEs, few do. The school on the island is St. Mary's School, which serves children from ages 4 to 16. The Naval Station had established a school building during World War II. The current facility opened in 1975 and has five classrooms, a kitchen, a stage, a computer room, and a craft and science room. Tristan students doing post-16 education receive assistance from the Tristan da Cunha Association Education Trust Fund and typically do so in the United Kingdom and South Africa.\nThe Tristan Song Project was a collaboration between St. Mary's School and amateur composers in Britain, led by music teacher Tony Triggs. It began in 2010 and involved St. Mary's pupils writing poems and Triggs providing musical settings by himself and his pupils. A desktop publication entitled \"Rockhopper Penguins and Other Songs\" (2010) embraced most of the songs completed that year and funded a consignment of guitars to the school. In February 2013, the Tristan Post Office issued a set of four Song Project stamps featuring island musical instruments and lyrics from Song Project songs about Tristan's volcano and wildlife. In 2014, the project broadened its scope and continues as the International Song Project.\nReligion.\nApproximately 80% of the population is Anglican, and 20% is Roman Catholic. The Roman Catholic population is served by the Mission \"sui iuris\" of Saint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha, which is administratively a part of the Apostolic Prefecture of the Falkland Islands. Edwin Dodgson, youngest brother of Lewis Carroll, spent several years as a missionary on the island in the nineteenth century.\nHealth.\nHealthcare is funded by the government, undertaken at most times by one resident doctor. Surgery or facilities for complex childbirth are therefore limited, and emergencies can necessitate communicating with passing fishing vessels so the injured person can be ferried to Cape Town.\nAs of late 2007, IBM and Beacon Equity Partners, co-operating with Medweb, the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, and the island's government on \"Project Tristan\", had supplied the island's doctor with access to long distance tele-medical help, making it possible to send EKG and X-ray pictures to doctors in other countries for instant consultation.\nThe Camogli Healthcare Centre, usually referred to as \"the hospital\", was built and equipped in 2016\u20132017 to the latest UK National Health Service (NHS) standards and was officially opened on 7 June 2017. It is located in the southwestern corner of the settlement below the previous hospital (built in 1971), which is now used by the veterinarians, and for general storage. The new hospital was funded by the UK Department for International Development with the intention that the improved facilities would allow more procedures to be performed locally by visiting specialists, and therefore reduce the need for expensive referrals to Cape Town.\nThere are normally two expatriate doctors on the island, who provide 24-hour cover. There are also normally two expatriate and four local nurses, as well as two dental technicians, a hospital manager, and ancillary staff. The medical staff deal with day-to-day medical matters, handle emergency cases, and undertake minor surgery. More complex and serious cases are transported to Cape Town for treatment, as were all expectant mothers for their deliveries until the Camogli Healthcare Centre was completed in 2017 and new medical facilities enabled local mothers to give birth on the island. As of 2022, five babies had been born in the island's Camogli Healthcare Centre.\nThere are instances of health problems attributed to endogamy, including glaucoma. In addition, there is a very high (42%) incidence of asthma among the population, and research by Noe Zamel of the University of Toronto has led to discoveries about the genetic nature of the disease. Three of the original settlers of the island had asthma.\nCulture.\nMusic and traditional dance.\nTristan residents Mary Swain and Percy Lavarello were recorded in 1962 whilst evacuated in Calshot, Hampshire, by Maud Karpeles and Peter Kennedy singing traditional songs and discussing the culture of the island, mainly music and dance; the full recording (split between seven tapes and also including other Tristan residents) can be heard on the British Library Sound Archive website. On these tapes, Mary Swain sings traditional English folk songs learnt from her mother, including seventeenth-century Child Ballads such as \"Barbara Allen\" and \"The Golden Vanity\". She also describes how dance was an important element of life on Tristan; well-known dances such as step dances, waltzes, polkas, mazurkas and schottisches were common, as well as many unique traditional dances such as \"The Donkey Dance\", \"The Pillow Dance\", \"The Chair Dance\" and something called \"Tabby Oaker's Big Toe\" which involved displaying one's feet. It seems that the music and dance of Tristan was ultimately derived from English traditions, but various peculiarities had developed.\nCrime.\nBetween 1988 and 2010, no one was arrested for crime by the single policeman on the island.\nRadio and television.\nLocal television began in 1984 using taped programming on Tuesday, Thursday and Sunday evenings. Live television did not arrive on the island until 2001, with the introduction of the British Forces Broadcasting Service (BFBS TV), which now provides six channels: BBC One, BBC Two, ITV, Channel 4, Sky News and BFBS Extra, relayed to islanders via local transmitters. Recently the service was upgraded to digital, most TV screens are modern and DTV, while some older analogue CRT equipment is still in use with digital boxes connected, and there is at least one TV set per house. BFBS Radio\u00a02 is the locally available radio station.\nNewspapers.\nThe \"Tristan Times\" was an online newspaper for the island published from 2003 to 2019. The island government also posts news announcements on its website, which is maintained by the UK-based Tristan da Cunha Association.\nHolidays and holiday traditions.\nThe island holds an annual break from government and factory work, which begins before Christmas and lasts for three weeks. The beginning of the holiday, called Break-Up Day, is usually marked with parties and celebrations. The islanders would traditionally have parties on Boxing Day, but not on Christmas Day.\nTraditionally, on \"Old Year's Day/Night\" (meaning \"New Year's Eve\"), the islanders would conceal their identities with masks or blackface and the men would wear women's clothing; everyone would celebrate anonymously moving between households, singing songs, dancing, shouting, playing instruments and firing guns. At the stroke of midnight, a bell would announce the new year. On New Year's Day, the islanders would play cricket and football, and once again party later in the day. The disguises sometimes recall English Border Morris dancers.\nSport.\nFootball, cricket, and baseball were all historically played on the island.\nIt has been reported that football was introduced to the locals in the 1920s by Rev. Henry Rogers, and it remains the island's favourite sport. Rose, Henry's wife, wrote about informal kick-abouts continuing for years, and these fast became a part of Tristanian culture. The islanders would split themselves into two teams and play friendly matches, especially on dates of special occasions, such as weddings, christenings etc.\nIn 1940, Tristan da Cunha's footballers played their first \"international\" game against the crew of a Norwegian ship. No record remains of the score. In the ensuing years, the game flourished, with the islanders playing matches against crews from vessels of various nationalities, including ships from the Royal Navy.\nWith live transmissions of televised football, the sport regained its former popularity. Tristan da Cunha FC was formed in 2002. A local fishing company bought them a kit (white shirts and blue shorts). They had a very basic pitch on American Field, named in recognition of the American forces stationed there during World War II. However, opponents were in short supply. It was a case of waiting for visiting opponents, and sometimes years might go by without any opportunities to play foreign opposition. Their first match was against a South African fishing vessel and they lost 10\u20136. The remoteness of Tristan da Cunha makes it virtually impossible for the team to travel abroad to play against foreign opposition. In recent times, the club's numbers have dropped to a level where only 5-a-side matches are being played.\nExplanatory notes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "31362", "revid": "37371155", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31362", "title": "Thomas R. Marshall", "text": "Vice President of the United States from 1913 to 1921\nThomas Riley Marshall (March 14, 1854\u00a0\u2013 June 1, 1925) was the 28th vice president of the United States from 1913 to 1921 under President Woodrow Wilson. A prominent lawyer in Indiana, he became an active and well known member of the Democratic Party by stumping across the state for other candidates and organizing party rallies that later helped him win election as the 27th governor of Indiana. In office, he attempted to implement changes from his progressive agenda to the Constitution of Indiana, but his efforts proved controversial and were blocked by the Indiana Supreme Court.\nMarshall's popularity as Indiana governor, and the state's status as a critical swing state, helped him secure the Democratic vice presidential nomination on a ticket with Wilson in 1912 and win the subsequent general election. An ideological rift developed between the two men during their first term leading Wilson to limit Marshall's influence in the administration. Marshall's brand of humor caused Wilson to move his office away from the White House, further isolating him. Marshall was targeted in an assassination attempt in 1915 for supporting intervention in World War I. During Marshall's second term he delivered morale-boosting speeches across the nation during the war and became the first U.S. vice president to hold cabinet meetings, which he did while Wilson was in Europe during peace negotiations. As he was president of the United States Senate, a small number of anti-war Senators kept it deadlocked by refusing to end debate. To enable critical wartime legislation to be passed, Marshall had the body adopt its first procedural rule allowing filibusters to be ended by a two-thirds majority vote\u2014a variation of this rule remains in effect.\nMarshall's vice presidency is most remembered for a leadership crisis following a stroke that incapacitated Wilson in October 1919. Because of their personal dislike for Marshall, Wilson's advisers and wife Edith sought to keep him uninformed about the president's condition to prevent him from assuming presidential powers and duties. Many people, including cabinet officials and congressional leaders, urged Marshall to become acting president, but he refused to forcibly assume Wilson's powers, not wanting to set a standard of doing so. Without strong leadership in the executive branch, the administration's opponents defeated the ratification of the League of Nations treaty and returned the United States to an isolationist foreign policy. Marshall ended his time in office as the first vice president since Daniel D. Tompkins, nearly a century earlier, to serve two full terms, and the first vice president re-elected, since John C. Calhoun.\nMarshall was known for his wit and sense of humor. One of his most enduring jokes provoked widespread laughter from his Senate colleagues during a floor debate. Responding to Senator Joseph Bristow's catalog of the nation's needs, Marshall quipped that, \"What this country needs is a really good five-cent cigar.\" After his terms as vice president, he opened an Indianapolis law practice where he authored several legal books and his memoir, \"Recollections\". He continued to travel and speak publicly. In 1925, Marshall died following a heart attack while on a trip to Washington, D.C.\nEarly life.\nFamily and background.\nMarshall's paternal grandfather, Riley Marshall, immigrated to Indiana in 1817 and settled on a farm in present-day Whitley County. He became wealthy when a moderate deposit of oil and natural gas was discovered on his farm; when he sold the property in 1827 it earned $25,000, $ in 2015 chained dollars. The money allowed him to purchase a modest estate and spend the rest of his life as an active member of the Indiana Democratic Party, serving as an Indiana State Senator, party chairman, and financial contributor. He was also able to send his only child, Daniel, to medical school.\nMarshall's mother, Martha Patterson, was orphaned at age thirteen while living in Ohio and moved to Indiana to live with her sister on a farm near the Marshalls' home. Martha was known for her wit and humor, as her son later would be. Martha and Daniel met and married in 1848.\nThomas Riley Marshall was born in North Manchester, Indiana, on March 14, 1854. Two years later, a sister was born, but she died in infancy. Martha had contracted tuberculosis, which Daniel believed to be the cause of their infant daughter's poor health. While Marshall was still a young boy, his family moved several times searching a good climate for Daniel to attempt different \"outdoor cures\" on Martha. They moved first to Quincy, Illinois in 1857. While the family was living in Illinois, Daniel Marshall, a supporter of the American Union and a staunch Democrat, took his four-year-old son, Thomas, to the Lincoln and Douglas debate in Freeport in 1858. Marshall later recalled that during the rally he sat on the laps of Stephen Douglas and Abraham Lincoln, alternating between the two candidates when they were not speaking, and remembered it as one of his earliest and most cherished memories.\nThe family moved to Osawatomie, Kansas, in 1859, but the frontier violence caused them to move to Missouri in 1860. Eventually, Daniel succeeded in curing Martha's disease. As the American Civil War neared, violence spread into Missouri during the Bleeding Kansas incidents. In October 1860 several men led by Duff Green demanded that Daniel Marshall provide medical assistance to the pro-slavery faction, but he refused, and the men left. When the Marshalls' neighbors warned that Green was planning to return and murder them, the family quickly packed their belongings and escaped by steamboat to Illinois. The Marshalls remained in Illinois only briefly, before relocating to Indiana, which was even farther from the volatile border region.\nEducation.\nOn settling in Pierceton, Indiana, Marshall began to attend public school. His father and grandfather became embroiled in a dispute with their Methodist minister when they refused to vote Republican in the 1862 election. The minister threatened to expel them from the church, to which Marshall's grandfather replied that he would \"take his risk on hell, but not the Republican Party\". The dispute prompted the family to move again, to Fort Wayne, and convert to the Presbyterian church. In Fort Wayne, Marshall attended high school, graduating in 1869. At age fifteen his parents sent him to Wabash College, in Crawfordsville, where he received a classical education. His father advised him to study medicine or become a minister, but neither interested him; he entered the school without knowing which profession he would take upon graduation.\nDuring college Marshall joined the Phi Gamma Delta fraternity, participated in literary and debating societies, and founded a Democratic Club. He secured a position on the staff of the college newspaper, the \"Geyser\", and began writing political columns defending Democratic policies. In 1872 he wrote an unfavorable column about a female lecturer at the school, accusing her of \"seeking liberties\" with the young boys in their boarding house. She hired lawyer Lew Wallace, the author of \"\", and filed a suit demanding that Marshall pay her $20,000 for libel. Marshall traveled to Indianapolis to find a defense lawyer and employed future United States President Benjamin Harrison, then a prominent Indianapolis lawyer. Harrison had the suit dropped by showing that the charges made by Marshall were probably true. In Marshall's memoir, he wrote that when he approached Harrison to pay his bill, his lawyer informed him that he would not charge him for the service, but instead gave him a lecture on the ethics of making such charges public. Marshall later recalled that he took the advice to heart, and was never again accused of making comments that could be considered libelous.\nMarshall was elected to Phi Beta Kappa during his final year at college. He graduated in June 1873, receiving the top grade in fourteen of his thirty-six courses in a class of twenty-one students. Because of his libel case, he had become increasingly interested in law and began seeking someone to teach him. At that time, a common way to become a lawyer was to apprentice under a practicing attorney. Marshall's great-uncle Woodson Marshall began to help him, but the younger Marshall soon moved to Columbia City, Indiana, to live with his parents. Marshall read law in the Columbia City law office of Walter Olds, a future member of the Indiana Supreme Court, for more than a year and was admitted to the bar on April 26, 1875.\nLaw practice.\nMarshall opened a law practice in Columbia City in 1876, taking on many minor cases. After gaining prominence, he accepted William F. McNagny as a partner in 1879 and began taking many criminal defense cases. The two men functioned well as partners. McNagny was better educated in law and worked out their legal arguments. Marshall, the superior orator, argued the cases before the judge and jury. Their firm became well known in the region after they handled a number of high-profile cases. In 1880 Marshall ran for public office for the first time as the Democratic candidate for his district's prosecuting attorney. The district was a Republican stronghold, and he was defeated. About the same time, he met and began to court Kate Hooper, and the two became engaged to marry. Kate died of an illness in 1882, one day before they were to be wed. Her death was a major emotional blow to Marshall, leading him to become an alcoholic.\nMarshall lived with his parents into his thirties. His father died in the late 1880s and his mother died in 1894, leaving him with the family estate and business. In 1895, while working on a case, Marshall met Lois Kimsey who was working as a clerk in her father's law firm. Despite their nineteen-year age difference, the couple fell in love and married on October 2. The Marshalls had a close marriage and were nearly inseparable, and spent only two nights apart during their nearly thirty-year marriage.\nMarshall's alcoholism had begun to interfere with his busy life before his marriage. He arrived at court hung-over on several occasions and was unable to keep his addiction secret in his small hometown. His wife helped him to overcome his drinking problem and give up liquor after she locked him in their home for two weeks to undergo a treatment regimen. Thereafter, he became active in temperance organizations and delivered several speeches about the dangers of liquor. Although he had stopped drinking, his past alcoholism was later raised by opponents during his gubernatorial election campaign.\nMarshall remained active in the Democratic party after his 1880 defeat and began stumping for other candidates and helping to organize party rallies across the state. His speeches were noted for their partisanship, but his rhetoric gradually shifted away from a conservative viewpoint in the 1890s as he began to identify himself with the growing progressive movement. He became a member of the state Democratic Central Committee in 1904, a position that raised his popularity and influence in the party.\nMarshall and his wife were involved in several private organizations. He was active in the Presbyterian Church, taught Sunday school, and served on the county fair board. As he grew wealthy from his law firm he became involved in local charities. An enthusiastic Mason in Columbia City Lodge No. 189 in the Grand Lodge of Indiana, he was a governing member of the state's York Rite bodies, awarded the thirty-third degree of the Scottish Rite in 1898, and became an Active member of the Supreme Council, Scottish Rite, Northern Jurisdiction in 1911. He remained a passionate Freemason until his death and served on several Masonic charitable boards. After his death, the $25,000 cost of erecting his mausoleum in Indianapolis' Crown Hill Cemetery was gratefully paid for by the Scottish Rite NMJ Supreme Council.\nGovernorship (1909\u20131913).\nCampaign.\nIn 1906, Marshall declined his party's nomination to run for Congress. He hinted, however, to state party leaders that he would be interested in running for Indiana governor in the 1908 election. He soon gained the support of several key labor unions, and was endorsed by Louis Ludlow, a reporter for the \"Indianapolis Star\". Despite this support, Marshall was a dark horse candidate at the state convention. Initially, Thomas Taggart, Indiana Democratic Party boss, did not support him because of Marshall's support of prohibition. Taggart wanted the party to nominate anti-prohibitionist Samuel Ralston, but the prohibitionist and anti-Taggart factions united with Marshall's supporters. To oppose L. Ert Slack, a temperance candidate, Taggart persuaded Ralston's delegates to support Marshall and give him the votes he needed to win the nomination.\nMarshall's opponent in the general election was Republican Congressman James E. Watson, and the campaign focused on temperance and prohibition. Just as it began, the Republican-controlled state government passed a local-option law that allowed counties to ban the sale of liquor. The law became the central point of debate between the parties and their gubernatorial candidates. The Democrats proposed that the local-option law be changed so that the decision to ban liquor sales could be made at the city and township level. This drew support from anti-prohibitionists, who saw it as an opportunity to roll back prohibition in some areas, and as the only alternative available to the total prohibition which the Republican Party advocated. The Democratic position also helped to retain prohibitionists' support by allowing prohibition to remain enacted in communities where a majority supported it. The Republican Party was in the midst of a period of instability, splitting along progressive and conservative lines. Their internal problems proved to be the deciding factor in the election, giving Marshall a narrow victory: he received 48.1 percent of the vote to Watson's 48.0 percent. Democrats also came to power in the Indiana House of Representatives by a small margin, though Republicans retained control of the Indiana Senate.\nProgressive agenda.\nMarshall was inaugurated as Governor of Indiana on January 11, 1909. Since his party had been out of power for many years, its initial objective was to appoint as many Democrats as possible to patronage positions. Marshall tried to avoid becoming directly involved in the patronage system. He allowed the party's different factions to have positions and appointed very few of his own choices. He allowed Taggart to manage the process and pick the candidates, but signed off on the official appointments. Although his position on patronage kept peace in his party, it prevented him from building a strong political base.\nDuring his term, Marshall focused primarily on advancing the progressive agenda. He successfully advocated the passage of a child labor law and anti-corruption legislation. He supported popular election of U.S. Senators, and the constitutional amendment to allow it was ratified by the Indiana General Assembly during his term. He also overhauled the state auditing agencies and claimed to have saved the government millions of dollars. Various measures aimed at improving working conditions were also approved, together with a bill that sought to improve tenement housing conditions in Indiana's two largest cities. He was unsuccessful in passing the rest of the progressive platform agenda items or persuading the legislature to call a convention to rewrite the state constitution to expand the government's regulatory powers.\nMarshall was a strong opponent of Indiana's recently passed eugenics and sterilization laws, and ordered state institutions not to follow them. He was an early, high-profile opponent of eugenics laws, and he carried his opposition into the vice-presidency. His governorship was the first in which no state executions took place, due to his opposition to capital punishment and his practice of pardoning and commuting the sentences of people condemned to execution. He regularly attacked corporations and used recently created antitrust laws to attempt to break several large businesses. He participated in a number of ceremonial events, including laying the final golden brick to complete the Indianapolis Motor Speedway in 1909.\nDemocratic Party campaign literature emphasized Marshall's record as governor, with one Democratic textbook from 1912 listing various laws enacted during his time in office by his instance. These included acts to investigate industrial and agricultural education; to permit night schools In cities; to prevent traffic in white slaves; to establish uniform weights and measures; to provide police court matrons; to protect against loan sharks; to strengthen the pure food act; to establish public play grounds; to provide free treatment for hydrophobia; to regulate the sale of cocaine and other drugs; to prevent blindness at birth; to require hygienic schoolhouses to permit medical examination of school children; to regulate the sale of cold storage products; to curtail child labor; and to \u201crequire medical supplies as part of a train equipment, etc.\u201d The textbook also listed various laws \u201cintended to protect the toilers\u201d that were also championed by Marshall. These included laws to require storm windows for locomotives; to require full switching crews; to require standard cabooses; to require inspection of locomotive boilers; to provide efficient headlights on locomotives; to require safety devices on switch engines; to require full train crews; to establish free employment agencies; to create a bureau of inspection for factories, workshops, mines and boilers; and to \u201cprovide a weekly wage; etc.\u201d\nMarshall's constitution.\nRewriting the state constitution became Marshall's central focus as governor, and after the General Assembly refused to call a constitutional convention he sought other ways to have a new constitution adopted. He and Jacob Piatt Dunn, a close friend and civic leader, wrote a new constitution that increased the state's regulatory powers considerably, set minimum wages, and gave constitutional protections to unions. Many of these reforms were also in the Socialist Party platform under its leader, Terre Haute native Eugene V. Debs. Republicans believed Marshall's constitution was an attempt to win over Debs' supporters, who had a strong presence in Indiana. The constitution also allowed direct-democracy initiatives and referendums to be held. The Democratic controlled assembly agreed to the request and put the measure on the ballot. His opponents attacked the direct-democracy provisions, claiming they were a violation of the United States Constitution, which required states to operate republican forms of government. The 1910 midterm elections gave the Democrats control of the Indiana Senate, increasing the constitution's chances of adoption. Marshall presented it to the General Assembly in 1911 and recommended that they submit it to voters in the 1912 election.\nRepublicans opposed the ratification process, and were infuriated that the Democrats were attempting to revise the entire constitution without calling a constitutional convention, as had been called for in the state's two previous constitutions. Marshall argued that no convention was needed because the existing constitution did not call for one. Republicans took the issue to court and the Marion County Circuit Court granted an injunction removing the constitution from the 1912 ballot. Marshall appealed, but the Indiana Supreme Court upheld the decision in a judgment which stated that the Constitution of Indiana could not be replaced in total without a constitutional convention, based on the precedent set by Indiana's first two constitutions. Marshall was angry with the decision and delivered a speech attacking the court and accusing it of overstepping its authority. He launched a final appeal to the United States Supreme Court but left office in January 1913 while the case was still pending. Later that year, the court declined the appeal, finding that the issue was within the sole jurisdiction of the state courts. Marshall was disappointed with the outcome. Subsequent scholars such as Linda Gugin and legal expert James St. Claire have called the process and the document \"seriously flawed\" and argued that had the constitution been adopted, large parts would probably have been ruled unconstitutional by the federal courts.\nVice presidency (1913\u20131921).\nElection.\nThe Indiana constitution prevented Marshall from serving a consecutive term as governor. He made plans to run for a United States Senate seat after his term ended, but another opportunity presented itself during his last months as governor. Although he did not attend the 1912 Democratic National Convention in Baltimore, his name was put forward as Indiana's choice for president. He was suggested as a compromise nominee, but William Jennings Bryan and his delegates endorsed Woodrow Wilson over Champ Clark, securing the nomination for Wilson. Indiana's delegates lobbied to have Marshall named the vice presidential candidate in exchange for supporting Wilson. Indiana was an important swing state, and Wilson hoped that Marshall's popularity would help him carry it in the general election. He had his delegates support Marshall, giving him the vice presidential nomination. Marshall privately turned down the nomination, assuming the job would be boring given its limited role. He changed his mind after Wilson assured him that he would be given plenty of responsibilities. During the campaign, Marshall traveled across the United States delivering speeches. The Wilson\u2013Marshall ticket easily won the 1912 election because of the division between the Republican Party and the Progressive Party.\nMarshall was not fond of Wilson, as he disagreed with him on a number of issues. Although Wilson invited Marshall to cabinet meetings, Marshall's ideas were rarely considered for implementation, and Marshall eventually stopped attending them regularly. In 1913, Wilson broke with longstanding tradition and met with senators to discuss policy. Previous presidents had used the vice president as an intermediary, but Wilson did not trust Marshall with delicate business. In his memoir, Marshall's only negative comment towards Wilson was, \"I have sometimes thought that great men are the bane of civilization, they are the real cause of all the bitterness and contention which amounts to anything in the world\". Their relationship was described as one of \"functioning animosity\".\nSenate developments.\nMarshall was not offended by Wilson's lack of interest in his ideas, and considered his primary constitutional duty to be in the Senate. He viewed the vice presidency as a legislative role, not an executive one. When he presided over the Senate, emotions sometimes ran high. During a debate on the Mexican border crisis in 1916, Marshall threatened to expel certain senators from the chamber for their raucous behavior, but did not carry through on the threat. On several occasions, he ordered the Senate gallery cleared. He voted eight times to break tie votes.\nIn the debates leading up to World War I, a number of isolationist senators filibustered bills that Wilson considered important. The filibusters lasted for weeks and twice lasted for over three months. Wilson and the bills' supporters requested that Marshall put a gag-order in place to cut off debate, but he refused on ethical grounds, allowing a number of bills to be defeated in hopes that opposition would eventually end their filibuster. Among the defeated bills was one allowing merchant ships to arm themselves, and another allowing the US government to make direct arms sales to the Allies. Despite their victories, the small group of senators continued to lock up the Senate to prevent any pro-war legislation from passing. In response, Marshall led the Senate to adopt a new rule on March 8, 1917, allowing filibusters to be broken by two-thirds of voting Senators. This replaced the previous rule that allowed any senator to prolong debate as long as he desired. The rule has been modified several times, most prominently that the current rule requires three-fifths of \"all\" Senators, not only the ones voting.\nAs Marshall made little news and was viewed as a somewhat comic figure in Washington because of his sense of humor, a number of Democratic party leaders wanted him removed from the 1916 reelection ticket. Wilson, after deliberating, decided keeping Marshall on would demonstrate party unity; thus in 1916 Wilson won reelection over the still divided Republican Party. Marshall became the first vice president re-elected since John C. Calhoun in 1828. Wilson and Marshall were the first president and vice president team to be re-elected since Monroe and Tompkins in 1820.\nAssassination attempt.\nOn the evening of July 2, 1915, Eric Muenter, a one time German professor at Harvard and Cornell universities, who opposed American support of the Allied war effort, broke into the U.S. Senate and, finding the door to the Senate chamber locked, laid dynamite outside the reception room, which happened to be next to Marshall's office door. Although the bomb was set with a timer, it exploded prematurely just before midnight, while no one was in the office.\nOn July 3, Muenter (who went under the pseudonym Frank Holt) burst into the Glen Cove, New York home of Jack Morgan, son of financier J. P. Morgan, demanding that he stop the sale of weapons to the Allies. Morgan told the man he was in no position to comply with his demand; Muenter shot him twice non-fatally and escaped. Muenter was later apprehended and confessed to attempted assassination of the vice president. Marshall was offered a personal security detachment after the incident, but declined it. Marshall had been receiving written death threats from numerous \"cranks\" for several weeks. \"Some of them were signed,\" Marshall told the press, \"but most were anonymous. I threw them all into the waste basket.\" Marshall added that he was \"more or less a fatalist\" and did not notify the Secret Service about the letters, \"but that he naturally was startled when he heard of the explosion at the Capitol.\" This incident marks the first assassination attempt on a U.S. vice president in American history.\nWorld War I.\nDuring Marshall's second term, the United States entered World War I. Marshall was a reluctant supporter of the war, believing the country to be unprepared and feared it would be necessary to enact conscription. He was pleased with Wilson's strategy to begin a military buildup before the declaration of war, and fully supported the war effort once it had begun. Shortly after the first troops began to assemble for transport to Europe, Wilson and Marshall hosted a delegation from the United Kingdom in which Marshall became privy to the primary war strategy. However, he was largely excluded from war planning and rarely received official updates on the progress of military campaigns. He usually received news of the war through the newspapers.\nWilson sent Marshall around the nation to deliver morale-boosting speeches and encourage Americans to buy Liberty Bonds to support the war effort. Marshall was well suited for the job, as he had been earning extra money as a public speaker while vice president, and gladly accepted the responsibility. In his speeches, he cast the war as a \"moral crusade to preserve the dignity of the state for the rights of individuals\". In his memoir, he recalled that the war seemed to drag on \"with leaden feet\", and that he was relieved when it finally ended. As the war neared its end, Marshall became the first vice president to conduct cabinet meetings; Wilson left him with this responsibility while traveling in Europe to sign the Versailles treaty and to work on gathering support for his League of Nations idea. Wilson became the first president to deliver a treaty to the Senate in person when he presented it to Marshall during a morning session.\nMorrison.\nMarshall's wife, Lois, was heavily involved in charitable activities in Washington and spent considerable time working at the Diet Kitchen Welfare Center providing free meals to impoverished children. In 1917 she became acquainted with a mother of newborn twins, one of whom was chronically ill. The child's parents were unable to get adequate treatment for their son's condition. Lois formed a close bond with the baby, named Clarence Ignatius Morrison, and offered to take him and help him find treatment. She and Marshall were unable to have children, and when she brought the baby home, Marshall told her that she could \"keep him, provided he did not squall\". Marshall grew to love the boy and wrote that he \"never walked the streets of Washington with as sure a certainty as he walked into my heart\", and, as the boy grew older, that he was \"beautiful as an angel; brilliant beyond his years; lovable from every standpoint\".\nThe Marshalls never officially adopted Morrison because they believed that to go through the procedure while his parents were still living would appear unusual to the public. Wanting to keep the situation private, they instead made a special arrangement with his parents. President Wilson felt obliged to acknowledge the boy as theirs and sent the couple a note that simply said, \"With congratulations to the baby. Wilson\". Morrison lived with the Marshalls for the rest of his life. In correspondence they referred to him as Morrison Marshall, but in person they called him Izzy. Lois took him to see many doctors and spent all her available time trying to nurse him back to health, but his condition worsened and he died in February 1920, just before his fourth birthday. His death devastated Marshall, who wrote in his memoir that Izzy \"was and is and ever will be so sacred to me\".\nSuccession crisis.\nPresident Wilson experienced a mild stroke in September 1919. On October 2, he was struck by a much more severe stroke that left him partially paralyzed and almost certainly incapacitated. Wilson's closest adviser, Joseph Tumulty, did not believe Marshall would be a suitable acting president and took precautions to prevent him from assuming presidential powers and duties. Wilson's wife Edith strongly disliked Marshall because of what she called his \"uncouthed\" disposition, and also opposed his assumption of presidential powers and duties. Tumulty and the First Lady believed that an official communication from Wilson's staff on his condition would allow Marshall to trigger the constitutional mechanism allowing him to become acting president, and made sure no such communication occurred. After Marshall demanded to know Wilson's status so that he could prepare for the possibility of becoming president, they had a reporter from \"The Baltimore Sun\" brief Marshall and inform him that Wilson was near death. Marshall later said that \"it was the first great shock of my life\", but without an official communication on Wilson's condition, he didn't believe he could constitutionally assume presidential powers and duties.\nOn October 5, Secretary of State Robert Lansing was the first official to propose that Marshall forcibly assume presidential powers and duties. Other cabinet secretaries backed Lansing's request. Congressional leaders of both parties also sent private communications to Marshall, who was cautious in accepting their support. After consulting with his wife and his long-time personal adviser, Mark Thistlethwaite, he privately refused to assume Wilson's duties and become acting president. The process for declaring a president incapacitated was unclear at that time, and he feared the precedent that might be set if he forcibly removed Wilson from his powers and duties. Marshall wanted the president to voluntarily allow his powers to devolve to the vice president, but that was impossible given his condition and unlikely given Wilson's dislike for Marshall. The vice president informed the cabinet that he would assume Wilson's powers and duties only in response to a joint resolution of Congress calling on him to do so or an official communication from Wilson or his staff asserting his inability to perform his duties.\nWilson was kept secluded by his wife and personal physician and only his close advisers were allowed to see him; none would divulge official information on his condition. Although Marshall sought to meet with Wilson to determine his condition, he was unable to do so. He instead relied on vague updates received through bulletins published by Wilson's physician. Believing that Wilson and his advisers would not voluntarily transfer power to the vice president, a group of congressional leaders initiated Marshall's requested joint resolution. However, senators opposed to the League of Nations treaty blocked the joint resolution in hopes of preventing the treaty's ratification. These senators believed that as acting president Marshall would make several key concessions that would allow the treaty to win ratification. Wilson, in his present condition, was either unwilling or unable to make the concessions, and debate on the bill had resulted in a deadlock.\nOn December 4, Lansing announced in a Senate committee hearing that no one in the cabinet had spoken with or seen Wilson in over sixty days. The senators seeking to elevate Marshall requested that a committee be sent to check on Wilson's condition, hoping to gain evidence to support their cause. Dubbed the \"smelling committee\" by several newspapers, the group discovered Wilson was in very poor health, but seemed to have recovered enough of his faculties to make decisions. Their report ended the perceived need for the joint resolution.\nAt a Sunday church service in mid-December, in what Marshall believed was an attempt by other officials to force him to assume the presidency, a courier brought a message informing him that Wilson had died. Marshall was shocked, and rose to announce the news to the congregation. The ministers held a prayer, the congregation began singing hymns, and many people wept. Marshall and his wife exited the building, and made a call to the White House to determine his next course of action, only to find that he had been the victim of a hoax, and that Wilson was still alive.\nMarshall performed a few ceremonial functions for the remainder of Wilson's term, such as hosting foreign dignitaries. Among these was Albert I, King of the Belgians, the first European monarch to visit the United States. Edward, Prince of Wales, the future monarch of the United Kingdom, spent two days with Marshall and received a personal tour of Washington from him. First Lady Edith Wilson performed most routine duties of government. She reviewed Wilson's communications and decided what to share with him and what to delegate to others. The resulting lack of leadership allowed the administration's opponents to prevent ratification of the League of Nations treaty. They attacked the treaty's tenth article, which they believed would allow the United States to be bound in an alliance to European countries that could force the country to return to war without an act of Congress. Marshall personally supported the treaty's adoption, but recommended several changes, including the requirement that all parties to it acknowledge the Monroe Doctrine and the United States' sphere of influence, and that the tenth article be made non-binding.\nWilson began to recover by the end of 1919, but remained secluded for the remainder of his term, steadfast in his refusal or inability to accept changes to the treaty. Marshall was prevented from meeting with him to ascertain his true condition until his final day in office. It remains unclear who made executive decisions during Wilson's incapacity, but it was likely the first lady with the help of the presidential advisers.\nPost-vice presidency (1921\u20131925).\nMarshall had his name entered as a candidate for the presidential nomination at the 1920 Democratic National Convention. He made arrangements with Thomas Taggart to have a delegation sent from Indiana to support his bid, but was unable to garner support outside of the Hoosier delegation. Ultimately he endorsed the Democratic nominees, James M. Cox for president and Franklin D. Roosevelt for vice president, but they were defeated by the Republican ticket of Warren G. Harding and Calvin Coolidge. On their election, Marshall sent a note to Coolidge offering him his \"sincere condolences\" for his misfortune of having been elected vice president. During his retirement, Marshall gravitated towards conservatism; declaring his opposition to various progressive measures such as the fixing of minimum wages.\nMarshall considered returning to Columbia City after leaving office, but instead bought a home and opened a law practice in Indianapolis, where he believed there would be better business opportunities. Harding nominated him to serve on the Lincoln Memorial Commission in 1921, and then to a more lucrative position on the Federal Coal Commission in 1922; Marshall resigned from both commissions in 1923. He spent over a year writing books on the law and his \"Recollections\", a humorous memoir. The latter book was completed in May 1925 and subsequent historians have noted it as unusual, even for its time, for not disclosing any secrets or attacking any of Marshall's enemies. Marshall remained a popular public speaker, and continued to travel to give speeches. The last he delivered was to high school students in the town of his birth.\nDeath.\nOn June 1, 1925, Marshall and his wife were on a trip to Washington, D.C., when he died suddenly from a heart attack at his room at the Willard Hotel, while reading his Bible in bed. He had been unwell for several days, and a nurse had accompanied them on the trip, but Marshall had already died by the time his wife could summon help. He was 71.\nA service and viewing was held in Washington two days later and was attended by many dignitaries. Marshall's remains were returned to Indianapolis, where he lay in state for two days; thousands visited his bier. His funeral service was held June 9, and he was interred in Crown Hill Cemetery, next to the grave of his \"adopted\" son Morrison \"Izzy\" Marshall. Lois Marshall moved to Arizona and remained widowed the rest of her life, living on her husband's pension and the $50,000 she earned by selling his memoir to the Bobbs-Merrill publishing company. She died in 1958 and was interred next to her husband.\nHumor.\nMarshall was known for his quick wit and good sense of humor. On hearing of his nomination as vice president, he announced that he was not surprised, as \"Indiana is the mother of Vice Presidents; home of more second-class men than any other state\". One of his favorite jokes, which he delivered in a speech before his departure for Washington, D.C., to become vice president, recounted a story of a man with two sons. One of the sons went to sea and drowned and the other was elected vice president; neither son was ever heard from again. On his election as vice president, he sent Woodrow Wilson a book, inscribed \"From your only Vice.\"\nMarshall's humor caused him trouble during his time in Washington. He was known to greet citizens walking by his office on the White House tour by saying to them, \"If you look on me as a wild animal, be kind enough to throw peanuts at me.\" This prompted Wilson to move Marshall's office to the Senate Office building, where the Vice President would not be disturbed by visitors. In response to Alexander Graham Bell's proposal to the board of the Smithsonian Institution to send a team to excavate for ruins in Guatemala, Marshall suggested that the team instead excavate around Washington. When asked why, he replied that, judging by the looks of the people walking on the street, they should be able to find buried cave-men no more than six feet down. The joke was not well received, and he was shut out of board meetings for nearly a year.\nMarshall's wit is best remembered for a phrase he introduced to the American lexicon. While presiding over a Senate session in 1914, Marshall responded to earlier comments from Senator Joseph L. Bristow that provided a long list of what he felt the country needed. Marshall reportedly leaned over and muttered to one of his clerks, \"What this country needs is more of this; what this country needs is more of that\" and quipped loudly enough for others to overhear, \"What this country needs is a really good five-cent cigar.\" Marshall's remark was popularized and widely circulated among a network of newspapers. Other accounts later embellished the story, including the exact situation that prompted his comment. In 1922 Marshall explained that the five-cent cigar was a metaphor for simpler times and \"buckling down to thrift and work\".\nLegacy.\nThe situation that arose after the incapacity of Wilson, for which Marshall's vice-presidency is most remembered, revived the national debate on the process of presidential succession. The topic was already being discussed when Wilson left for Europe, which influenced him to allow Marshall to conduct cabinet meetings in his absence. Wilson's incapacity during 1919 and the lack of action by Marshall made it a major issue. The lack of a clear process for presidential succession had first become an issue when President William Henry Harrison died in office in 1841, but little progress had been made passing a constitutional amendment to remedy the problem. Nearly fifty years later, after the assassination of John F. Kennedy, the Twenty-fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution was passed, allowing the vice president to assume the presidential powers and duties any time the president was rendered incapable of carrying out the powers and duties of the office.\nHistorians have varied interpretations of Marshall's vice presidency. Claire Suddath rated Marshall as one of the worst vice presidents in American history in a 2008 \"Time\" magazine article. Samuel Eliot Morison wrote that had Marshall carried out his constitutional duties, assumed the presidential powers and duties, and made the concessions necessary for the passage of the League of Nations treaty in late 1920, the United States would have been much more involved in European affairs and could have helped prevent the rise of Adolf Hitler, which began in the following year. Morison and a number of other historians claim that Marshall's decision was an indirect cause of the Second World War. Charles Thomas, one of Marshall's biographers, wrote that although Marshall's assumption of presidential powers and duties would have made World War II much less likely, modern hypothetical speculation on the subject was unfair to Marshall, who made the correct decision in not forcibly removing Wilson from his duties, even temporarily.\nThe World War II Liberty Ship was named in his honor."}
{"id": "31364", "revid": "23646674", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31364", "title": "Physiologus", "text": "Didactic Christian text\nThe Physiologus () is a didactic Christian text written or compiled in Greek by an unknown author in Alexandria. Its composition has been traditionally dated to the 2nd century AD by readers who saw parallels with writings of Clement of Alexandria, who is asserted to have known the text, though Alan Scott has made a case for a date at the end of the 3rd or in the 4th century. The \"Physiologus\" consists of descriptions of animals, birds, and fantastic creatures, sometimes stones and plants, provided with moral content. Each animal is described, and an anecdote follows, from which the moral and symbolic qualities of the animal are derived. Manuscripts are often, but not always, given illustrations, often lavish.\nThe book was translated into Armenian in 5th century, into Latin by the early 6th century or possibly even by the mid-4th century and into Ethiopic and Syriac, then into many European and Middle-Eastern languages, and many illuminated manuscript copies such as the Bern Physiologus survive. It retained its influence over ideas of the \"meaning\" of animals in Europe for over a thousand years. It was a predecessor of bestiaries (books of beasts). Medieval poetical literature is full of allusions that can be traced to the \"Physiologus\" tradition; the text also exerted great influence on the symbolism of medieval ecclesiastical art: symbols like those of the phoenix rising from its ashes and the pelican feeding her young with her own blood are still well-known.\nAllegorical stories.\nThe story is told of the lion whose cubs are born dead and receive life when the old lion breathes upon them, and of the phoenix which burns itself to death and rises on the third day from the ashes; both are taken as types of Christ. The unicorn also which only permits itself to be captured in the lap of a pure virgin is a type of the Incarnation; the pelican that sheds its own blood in order to sprinkle its dead young, so that they may live again, is a type of the salvation of mankind by the death of Christ on the Cross. This motif is known as the Pelican in her Piety.\nSome allegories set forth the deceptive enticements of the Devil and his defeat by Christ; others present qualities as examples to be imitated or avoided.\nAttributions.\nThe conventional title \"Physiologus\" was because the author introduces his stories from natural history with the phrase: \"the physiologus says\", that is, \"the naturalist says\", \"the natural philosophers, the authorities for natural history say\", a term derived from Greek \u03c6\u03cd\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2 (\"physis\", \"nature\") and \u03bb\u03cc\u03b3\u03bf\u03c2 (\"logos\", \u201cword\u201d).\nIn later centuries it was ascribed to various celebrated Fathers, especially Epiphanius, Basil of Caesarea, and St. Peter of Alexandria. \nThe assertion that the method of the \"Physiologus\" presupposes the allegorical exegesis developed by Origen is not correct; the so-called \"Letter of Barnabas\" offers, before Origen, a sufficient model, not only for the general character of the \"Physiologus\" but also for many of its details. It can hardly be asserted that the later recensions, in which the Greek text has been preserved, present even in the best and oldest manuscripts a perfectly reliable transcription of the original, especially as this was an anonymous and popular treatise.\nEarly history.\nAbout the year 400 the \"Physiologus\" was translated into Latin; from Greek, the original language that it was written in. In the 5th century into Ethiopic [edited by Fritz Hommel with a German translation (Leipzig, 1877), revised German translation in \"Romanische Forschungen\", V, 13-36]; into Armenian [edited by Pitra in \"Spicilegium Solesmense\", III, 374\u201390; French translation by Cahier in \"Nouveaux M\u00e9langes d'arch\u00e9ologie, d'histoire et de litt\u00e9rature\" (Paris, 1874)] (see also the recent edition: Gohar Muradyan, Physiologus. The Greek And Armenian Versions With a Study of Translation Technique, Leuven\u2013Dudley MA: Peeters, 2005 [Hebrew University Armenian Studies 6]); into Syriac [edited by Tychsen, \"Physiologus Syrus\" (Rostock, 1795), a later Syriac and an Arabic version edited by Land in \"Anecdota Syriaca\", IV (Leyden, 1875)]. An Old Slavic (Old Bulgarian) translation was made in the 10th century [edited by Karneyev, , Sankt Peterburg, 1890].\nEpiphanius used \"Physiologus\" in his \"Panarion\" and from his time numerous further quotations and references to the \"Physiologus\" in the Greek and the Latin Church Fathers show that it was one of the most generally known works of Christian Late Antiquity. Various translations and revisions were current in the Middle Ages. The earliest translation into Latin was followed by various recensions, among them the \"Sayings of St. John Chrysostom on the natures of beasts\", A metrical Latin \"Physiologus\" was written in the 11th century by a certain Theobaldus, and printed by Morris in \"An Old English Miscellany\" (1872), 201 sqq.; it also appears among the works of Hildebertus Cenomanensis in \"Pat.Lat.\", CLXXI, 1217\u201324. To these should be added the literature of the bestiaries, in which the material of the \"Physiologus\" was used; the \"Tractatus de bestiis et alius rebus\", often misattributed to Hugo of St. Victor, and the \"Speculum naturale\" of Vincent of Beauvais.\nTranslations.\nThe \"Physiologus\" had an impact on neighboring literatures: medieval translations into Latin, Armenian, Georgian, Slavic, Syriac, Coptic, and Ethiopic are known.\nTranslations and adaptations from the Latin introduced the \"Physiologus\" into almost all the languages of Western Europe. An Old High German (Alemannic) translation was written in Hirsau in c.\u00a01070 (ed. M\u00fcllenhoff and Scherer in \"Denkm\u00e4ler deutscher Poesie und Prosa\" No. LXXXI); a later translation (12th century) has been edited by Friedrich Lauchert in \"Geschichte des Physiologus\" (pp.\u00a0280\u201399); and a rhymed version appears in Karajan, \"Deutsche Sprachdenkmale des XII. Jahrhunderts\" (pp.\u00a073\u2013106), both based on the Latin text known as \"Dicta Chrysostomi.\" Fragments of a 9th-century metrical Anglo-Saxon \"Physiologus\" are extant (ed. Thorpe in \"Codex Exoniensis\" pp.\u00a0335\u201367, Grein in \"Bibliothek der angels\u00e4chsischen Poesie\" I, 223-8).\nAbout the middle of the 13th century there appeared a Middle English metrical \"Bestiary\", an adaptation of the Latin \"Physiologus Theobaldi\"; this has been edited by Wright and Halliwell in \"Reliqui\u00e6 antiqu\u00e6\" (I, 208-27), also by Morris in \"An Old English Miscellany\" (1-25). There is an \"Icelandic\" \"Physiologus\" preserved in two fragmentary redactions from around 1200.\nIn the 12th and 13th centuries there appeared the \"Bestiaires\" of Philippe de Thaun, a metrical Old French version, edited by Thomas Wright in \"Popular Treatises on Science Written during the Middle Ages\" (74-131), and by Walberg (Lund and Paris, 1900); that by Guillaume, clerk of Normandy, called \"Bestiare divin\", and edited by Cahier in his \"M\u00e9langes d'arch\u00e9ologie\" (II-IV), also edited by Hippeau (Caen, 1852), and by Reinsch (Leipzig, 1890); the \"Bestiare de Gervaise\", edited by Paul Meyer in \"Romania\" (I, 420-42); the \"Bestiare\" in prose of Pierre le Picard, edited by Cahier in \"M\u00e9langes\" (II-IV).\nAn adaptation is found in the old Waldensian literature, and has been edited by Alfons Mayer in \"Romanische Forschungen\" (V, 392 sqq.). As to the Italian bestiaries, a Tuscan-Venetian \"Bestiarius\" has been edited (Goldstaub and Wendriner, \"Ein tosco-venezianischer Bestiarius\", Halle, 1892). Extracts from the \"Physiologus\" in Proven\u00e7al have been edited by Bartsch, \"Provenzalisches Lesebuch\" (162-66). The \"Physiologus\" survived in the literatures of Eastern Europe in books on animals written in Middle Greek, among the Slavs to whom it came from the Byzantine (translations of the so-called Byzantinian redaction were made in Middle Bulgarian in the 13th-14th century; they were edited in 2011 by Ana Stoykova in an electronic edition, see reference), and in a Romanian translation from a Slavic original (edited by Moses Gaster with an Italian translation in \"Archivio glottologico italiano\", X, 273-304).\nThe manuscript tradition.\nModern study of \"Physiologus\" can be said to have begun with Francesco Sbordone's edition, 1936, which established three traditions in the surviving manuscripts of the text, a \"primitive\" tradition, a Byzantine one and a pseudo-Basil tradition. Ben Perry showed that a manuscript Sbordone had missed, at the Morgan Library, was the oldest extant Greek version, a late 10th-century manuscript from Grottaferrata. Anna Dorofeeva has argued that the numerous early Latin Physiologus manuscripts can be seen as evidence for an 'encyclopedic drive' amongst early medieval monastic writing centres.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "31365", "revid": "44449368", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31365", "title": "The New Yorker", "text": "American weekly magazine\nThe New Yorker is an American magazine featuring journalism, commentary, criticism, essays, fiction, satire, cartoons, and poetry. It was founded on February 21, 1925, by Harold Ross and his wife Jane Grant, a reporter for \"The New York Times\". Together with entrepreneur Raoul H. Fleischmann, they established the F-R Publishing Company and set up the magazine's first office in Manhattan. Ross remained the editor until his death in 1951, shaping the magazine's editorial tone and standards, such as its robust fact-checking operation, for which \"The New Yorker\" is widely recognized.\nAlthough its reviews and events listings often focused on the cultural life of New York City, \"The New Yorker\" gained a reputation for publishing serious essays, long-form journalism, well-regarded fiction, and humor for a national and international audience, including work by writers such as Truman Capote, Vladimir Nabokov, and Alice Munro. In the late 20th and early 21st centuries, the magazine adapted to the digital era, maintaining its traditional print operations while expanding its online presence, including making its archives available on the Internet and introducing a digital version of the magazine. David Remnick has been the editor of \"The New Yorker\" since 1998. Since 2004, \"The New Yorker\" has published endorsements in U.S. presidential elections.\n\"The New Yorker\" is published 47 times annually, with five of these issues covering two-week spans. It is well known for its illustrated and often topical covers, such as \"View of the World from 9th Avenue\", its commentaries on popular culture and eccentric American culture, its attention to modern fiction by the inclusion of short stories and literary reviews, its rigorous fact checking and copy editing, its investigative journalism and reporting on politics and social issues, and its single-panel cartoons reproduced throughout each issue. According to a 2012 Pew Research Center study, \"The New Yorker\", along with \"The Atlantic\" and \"Harper's Magazine\", ranked highest in college-educated readership among major American media outlets. It has won eleven Pulitzer Prizes since 2014, the first year magazines became eligible for the prize.\nOverview and history.\n\"The New Yorker\" was founded by Harold Ross (1892\u20131951) and his wife Jane Grant (1892\u20131972), a \"New York Times\" reporter, and debuted on February 21, 1925. Ross wanted to create a sophisticated humor magazine that would be different from perceivably \"corny\" humor publications, such as \"Judge\", where he had worked, or the old \"Life\". Ross partnered with entrepreneur Raoul H. Fleischmann (who founded the General Baking Company) to establish the F-R Publishing Company. The magazine's first offices were at 25 West 45th Street in Manhattan. Ross edited the magazine until his death in 1951. During the early, occasionally precarious years of its existence, the magazine prided itself on its cosmopolitan sophistication. Ross declared in a 1925 prospectus for the magazine: \"It has announced that it is not edited for the old lady in Dubuque\".\nAlthough the magazine never lost its touches of humor, it soon established itself as a preeminent forum for serious fiction, essays and journalism. Shortly after the end of World War II, John Hersey's essay \"Hiroshima\" filled an entire issue. The magazine has published short stories by many of the most respected writers of the 20th and 21st centuries, including Ann Beattie, Sally Benson, Maeve Brennan, Truman Capote, Rachel Carson, John Cheever, Roald Dahl, Mavis Gallant, Geoffrey Hellman, Ernest Hemingway, Stephen King, Ruth McKenney, John McNulty, Joseph Mitchell, Lorrie Moore, Alice Munro, Haruki Murakami, Vladimir Nabokov, John O'Hara, Dorothy Parker, S.J. Perelman, Philip Roth, George Saunders, J. D. Salinger, Irwin Shaw, James Thurber, John Updike, Eudora Welty, and E. B. White. Publication of Shirley Jackson's \"The Lottery\" drew more mail than any other story in the magazine's history.\nThe nonfiction feature articles (usually the bulk of an issue) cover an eclectic array of topics. Subjects have included eccentric evangelist Creflo Dollar, the different ways in which humans perceive the passage of time, and M\u00fcnchausen syndrome by proxy.\nThe magazine is known for its editorial traditions. Under the rubric \"Profiles\", it has published articles about prominent people such as Ernest Hemingway, Henry R. Luce, Marlon Brando, Hollywood restaurateur Michael Romanoff, magician Ricky Jay, and mathematicians David and Gregory Chudnovsky. Other enduring features have been \"Goings on About Town\", a listing of cultural and entertainment events in New York, and \"The Talk of the Town\", a feuilleton or miscellany of brief pieces\u2014frequently humorous, whimsical, or eccentric vignettes of life in New York\u2014in a breezily light style, although latterly the section often begins with a serious commentary. For many years, newspaper snippets containing amusing errors, unintended meanings or badly mixed metaphors (\"Block That Metaphor\") have been used as filler items, accompanied by a witty retort. There is no masthead listing the editors and staff. Despite some changes, the magazine has kept much of its traditional appearance over the decades in typography, layout, covers, and artwork. The magazine was acquired by Advance Publications, the media company owned by Samuel Irving Newhouse Jr, in 1985, for $200\u00a0million when it was earning less than $6\u00a0million a year.\nRoss was succeeded as editor by William Shawn (1951\u20131987), followed by Robert Gottlieb (1987\u20131992) and Tina Brown (1992\u20131998). The current editor of \"The New Yorker\" is David Remnick, who succeeded Brown in July 1998.\nAmong the important nonfiction authors who began writing for the magazine during Shawn's editorship were Dwight Macdonald, Kenneth Tynan, and Hannah Arendt, whose \"Eichmann in Jerusalem\" reportage appeared in the magazine, before it was published as a book.\nBrown's tenure attracted more controversy than Gottlieb's or even Shawn's, due to her high profile (Shawn, by contrast, had been an extremely shy, introverted figure), and to the changes she made to a magazine with a similar look for the previous half-century. She introduced color to the editorial pages (several years before \"The New York Times\") and included photography, with less type on each page and a generally more modern layout. More substantively, she increased the coverage of current events and topics such as celebrities and business tycoons, and placed short pieces throughout \"Goings on About Town\", including a racy column about nightlife in Manhattan.\nSince the late 1990s, \"The New Yorker\" has used the Internet to publish current and archived material, and maintains a website with some content from the current issue (plus exclusive web-only content). Subscribers have access to the full current issue online and a complete archive of back issues viewable as they were originally printed. In addition, \"The New Yorker\"'s cartoons are available for purchase online. In 2014, \"The New Yorker\" opened up online access to its archive, expanded its plans to run an ambitious website, and launched a paywalled subscription model. Web editor Nicholas Thompson said, \"What we're trying to do is to make a website that is to the Internet what the magazine is to all other magazines\".\nThe magazine's editorial staff unionized in 2018 and The New Yorker Union signed its first collective bargaining agreement in 2021.\nInfluence and significance.\n\"The New Yorker\" influenced a number of similar magazines, including \"The Brooklynite\" (1926 to 1930), \"The Chicagoan\" (1926 to 1935), and Paris's \"The Boulevardier\" (1927 to 1932).\nKurt Vonnegut said that \"The New Yorker\" has been an effective instrument for getting a large audience to appreciate modern literature. Tom Wolfe wrote of the magazine: \"The \"New Yorker\" style was one of leisurely meandering understatement, droll when in the humorous mode, tautological and litotical when in the serious mode, constantly amplified, qualified, adumbrated upon, nuanced and renuanced, until the magazine's pale-gray pages became High Baroque triumphs of the relative clause and appository modifier\".\nJoseph Rosenblum, reviewing Ben Yagoda's \"About Town\", a history of the magazine from 1925 to 1985, wrote, \"\"The New Yorker\" did create its own universe. As one longtime reader wrote to Yagoda, this was a place 'where Peter DeVries\u00a0... [\"sic\"] was forever lifting a glass of Piesporter, where Niccol\u00f2 Tucci (in a plum velvet dinner jacket) flirted in Italian with Muriel Spark, where Nabokov sipped tawny port from a prismatic goblet (while a Red Admirable perched on his pinky), and where John Updike tripped over the master's Swiss shoes, excusing himself charmingly'\".\nUnited States presidential election endorsements.\nOn November 1, 2004, the magazine endorsed a presidential candidate for the first time, choosing Democratic nominee John Kerry over incumbent Republican George W. Bush.\nCartoons.\n\"The New Yorker\" has featured cartoons (usually gag cartoons) since it began publication in 1925. For years, its cartoon editor was Lee Lorenz, who first began cartooning in 1956 and became a \"New Yorker\" contract contributor in 1958. After serving as the magazine's art editor from 1973 to 1993 (when he was replaced by Fran\u00e7oise Mouly), he continued in the position of cartoon editor until 1998. His book \"The Art of the New Yorker: 1925\u20131995\" (Knopf, 1995) was the first comprehensive survey of all aspects of the magazine's graphics. In 1998, Robert Mankoff took over as cartoon editor and edited at least 14 collections of \"New Yorker\" cartoons. Mankoff also usually contributed a short article to each book, describing some aspect of the cartooning process or the methods used to select cartoons for the magazine. He left the magazine in 2017.\n\"The New Yorker\"'s stable of cartoonists has included many important talents in American humor, including Charles Addams, Peter Arno, Charles Barsotti, George Booth, Roz Chast, Tom Cheney, Sam Cobean, Leo Cullum, Richard Decker, Pia Guerra, J. B. Handelsman, Helen E. Hokinson, Pete Holmes, Ed Koren, Reginald Marsh, Mary Petty, George Price, Charles Saxon, Burr Shafer, Otto Soglow, William Steig, Saul Steinberg, James Stevenson, James Thurber, and Gahan Wilson.\nMany early \"New Yorker\" cartoonists did not caption their cartoons. In his book \"The Years with Ross\", Thurber describes the newspaper's weekly art meeting, where cartoons submitted over the previous week were brought up from the mail room to be looked over by Ross, the editorial department, and a number of staff writers. Cartoons were often rejected or sent back to artists with requested amendments, while others were accepted and captions were written for them. Some artists hired their own writers; Hokinson hired James Reid Parker in 1931. Brendan Gill relates in his book \"Here at The New Yorker\" that at one point in the early 1940s, the quality of the artwork submitted to the magazine seemed to improve. It later was found out that the office boy (a teenaged Truman Capote) had been acting as a volunteer art editor, dropping pieces he did not like down the far end of his desk.\nSeveral of the magazine's cartoons have reached a higher plateau of fame. One 1928 cartoon drawn by Carl Rose and captioned by E.\u00a0B. White shows a mother telling her daughter, \"It's broccoli, dear\". The daughter responds, \"I say it's spinach and I say the hell with it\". The phrase \"I say it's spinach\" entered the vernacular, and three years later, the Broadway musical \"Face the Music\" included Irving Berlin's song \"I Say It's Spinach (And the Hell with It)\". The catchphrase \"back to the drawing board\" originated with the 1941 Peter Arno cartoon showing an engineer walking away from a crashed plane, saying, \"Well, back to the old drawing board\".\nThe most reprinted is Peter Steiner's 1993 drawing of two dogs at a computer, with one saying, \"On the Internet, nobody knows you're a dog\". According to Mankoff, Steiner and the magazine have split more than $100,000 in fees paid for the licensing and reprinting of this single cartoon, with more than half going to Steiner.\nOver seven decades, many hardcover compilations of \"New Yorker\" cartoons have been published, and in 2004, Mankoff edited \"The Complete Cartoons of The New Yorker\", a 656-page collection with 2,004 of the magazine's best cartoons published during 80 years, plus a double CD set with all 68,647 cartoons ever published in the magazine. This features a search function allowing readers to search for cartoons by cartoonist's name or year of publication. The newer group of cartoonists in recent years includes Pat Byrnes, J. C. Duffy, Liana Finck, Emily Flake, Robert Leighton, Michael Maslin, Julia Suits, and P. C. Vey. Will McPhail cited his beginnings as \"just ripping off \"Calvin and Hobbes\", Bill Watterson, and doing little dot eyes\". The notion that some \"New Yorker\" cartoons have punchlines so oblique as to be impenetrable became a subplot in the \"Seinfeld\" episode \"The Cartoon\", as well as a playful jab in \"The Simpsons\" episode \"The Sweetest Apu\".\nIn April 2005, the magazine began using the last page of each issue for \"The New Yorker Cartoon Caption Contest\". Captionless cartoons by \"The New Yorker\"'s regular cartoonists are printed each week. Captions are submitted by readers, and three are chosen as finalists. Readers then vote on the winner. Anyone age 13 or older can enter or vote. At first, the winner received a print of the cartoon (with the winning caption) signed by the artist who drew the cartoon, but this practice ceased. In 2017, after Bob Mankoff left the magazine, Emma Allen became its youngest and first female cartoon editor.\nComics journalism.\nSince 1993, the magazine has published occasional stories of comics journalism (alternately called \"sketchbook reports\") by such cartoonists as Marisa Acocella Marchetto, Barry Blitt, Sue Coe, Robert Crumb and Aline Kominsky-Crumb, Jules Feiffer, Ben Katchor, Carol Lay, Gary Panter, Art Spiegelman, Mark Alan Stamaty, and Ronald Wimberly.\nCrosswords and puzzles.\nIn April 2018, \"The New Yorker\" launched a crossword puzzle series with a weekday crossword published every Monday. Subsequently, it launched a second, weekend crossword that appears on Fridays and relaunched cryptic puzzles that were run in the magazine in the late 1990s. In June 2021, it began publishing new cryptics weekly. In July 2021, \"The New Yorker\" introduced Name Drop, a trivia game, which is posted online weekdays. In March 2022, \"The New Yorker\" moved to publishing online crosswords every weekday, with decreasing difficulty Monday through Thursday and themed puzzles on Fridays. The puzzles are written by a rotating stable of 13 constructors. They integrate cartoons into the solving experience. The Christmas 2019 issue featured a crossword puzzle by Patrick Berry that had cartoons as clues, with the answers being captions for the cartoons. In December 2019, Liz Maynes-Aminzade was named \"The New Yorker\"'s first puzzles and games editor.\nEustace Tilley.\nThe magazine's first cover illustration, depicting a dandy peering at a butterfly through a monocle, was drawn by Rea Irvin, the magazine's first art editor. It was based on an 1834 caricature of the Count d'Orsay that appeared as an illustration in the 11th edition of the \"Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica\". The character on the original cover, now known as Eustace Tilley, was created for \"The New Yorker\" by Corey Ford. The hero of a series titled \"The Making of a Magazine\", which began on the inside front cover of the August 8 issue that first summer, Tilley was a younger man than the figure on the original cover. His top hat was of a newer style, without the curved brim. He wore a morning coat and striped formal trousers. Ford borrowed Eustace Tilley's last name from an aunt\u2014he had always found it vaguely humorous. He selected \"Eustace\" for euphony.\nThe character has become a kind of mascot for \"The New Yorker\", frequently appearing in its pages and on promotional materials. Traditionally, Irvin's original Tilley cover illustration is used every year on the issue closest to the anniversary date of February 21, though on several occasions a newly drawn variation has been substituted.\nCovers.\nThe magazine is known for its illustrated and often topical covers. As of 2025[ [update]], only two covers have featured photography.\n\"View of the World\" cover.\nSaul Steinberg created 85 covers and 642 internal drawings and illustrations for the magazine. His most famous work is probably the cover for issue March 29, 1976, featuring an illustration, most often called \"View of the World from 9th Avenue\", sometimes called \"A Parochial New Yorker's View of the World\" or \"A New Yorker's View of the World\", which depicts a map of the world as seen by self-absorbed New Yorkers.\nThe illustration is split in two, with the bottom half showing Manhattan's 9th Avenue, 10th Avenue, and the Hudson River, and the top half depicting the rest of the world. The rest of the US is the size of the three New York City blocks and is drawn as a square, with a thin brown strip along the Hudson representing \"Jersey\", the names of five cities (Los Angeles; Washington, D.C.; Las Vegas; Kansas City; and Chicago) and three states (Texas, Utah, and Nebraska) scattered among a few rocks for the U.S. beyond New Jersey. The Pacific Ocean, perhaps half again as wide as the Hudson, separates the US from three flattened land masses labeled China, Japan and Russia.\nThe illustration\u2014depicting New Yorkers' self-image of their place in the world, or perhaps outsiders' view of New Yorkers' self-image\u2014inspired many similar works, including the poster for the 1984 film \"Moscow on the Hudson\"; that movie poster led to a lawsuit, \"Steinberg v. Columbia Pictures Industries, Inc.\", 663 F. Supp. 706 (S.D.N.Y. 1987), which held that Columbia Pictures violated the copyright that Steinberg held.\nThe cover was later satirized by Barry Blitt for the cover of \"The New Yorker\" on October 6, 2008, featuring Sarah Palin looking out of her window seeing only Alaska, with Russia in the far background. The cover of the March 21, 2009, issue of \"The Economist\", titled \"How China sees the World\", is an homage to Steinberg, depicting the viewpoint from Beijing's Chang'an Avenue instead of Manhattan.\n9/11.\nHired by Tina Brown in 1992, Art Spiegelman worked for \"The New Yorker\" for ten years, but resigned a few months after the September\u00a011 terrorist attacks. Spiegelman and Fran\u00e7oise Mouly received wide acclaim for their cover for the issue from September 24, 2001; it was voted as being among the top ten magazine covers of the past 40 years by the American Society of Magazine Editors:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"New Yorker\" Covers Editor Fran\u00e7oise Mouly repositioned Art Spiegelman's silhouettes, inspired by Ad Reinhardt's black-on-black paintings, so that the North Tower's antenna breaks the \"W\" of the magazine's logo. Spiegelman wanted to see the emptiness, and find the awful/awe-filled image of all that disappeared on 9/11. The silhouetted Twin Towers were printed in a fifth, black ink, on a field of black made up of the standard four color printing inks. An overprinted clear varnish helps create the ghost images that linger, insisting on their presence through the blackness.\nThe cover appears to be totally black, but upon close examination it reveals the silhouettes of the World Trade Center towers in a darker shade of black. In some situations, the ghost images become visible only when the magazine is tilted toward a light source. In September 2004, Spiegelman reprised the image on the cover of his book \"In the Shadow of No Towers\".\n\"New Yorkistan\".\nIn December 2001, the magazine printed a cover by Maira Kalman and Rick Meyerowitz showing a map of New York in which neighborhoods are labeled with humorous names reminiscent of Middle Eastern and Central Asian place names and referencing the neighborhood's real name or characteristics (e.g., \"Fuhgeddabouditstan\", \"Botoxia\"). The cover had cultural resonance in the wake of September 11, and became a popular print and poster.\nControversial covers.\nCrown Heights in 1993.\nFor the 1993 Valentine's Day issue, the cover by Spiegelman depicted a black woman and a Hasidic Jewish man kissing, referencing the Crown Heights riot of 1991. The cover was criticized by black and Jewish observers. Jack Salzman and Cornel West called reaction to the cover the magazine's \"first national controversy\".\n2008 Obama cover satire and controversy.\nOn July 21, 2008, \"The Politics of Fear\", a cartoon by Barry Blitt, was featured on the cover of \"The New Yorker\", depicting then presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Barack Obama in the turban and shalwar kameez typical of many Muslims, fist bumping with his wife, Michelle, portrayed with an Afro and wearing camouflage trousers with an assault rifle slung over her back. They are standing in the Oval Office, with a portrait of Osama bin Laden hanging on the wall and an American flag burning in the fireplace. This parody was inspired by Fox News host E. D. Hill's paraphrase of an internet comment that asked whether a gesture the Obamas made was a \"terrorist fist jab\". Later, Hill's contract was not renewed.\nMany \"New Yorker\" readers saw the image as a lampoon of \"The Politics of Fear\", its title. Some Obama supporters, as well as his presumptive Republican opponent, John McCain, accused the magazine of publishing an incendiary cartoon whose irony could be lost on some readers. Editor David Remnick felt the image's obvious excesses rebuffed the concern it could be misunderstood. \"The intent of the cover\", he said, \"is to satirize the vicious and racist attacks and rumors and misconceptions about the Obamas that have been floating around in the blogosphere and are reflected in public opinion polls. What we set out to do was to throw all these images together, which are all over the top and to shine a kind of harsh light on them, to satirize them.\" Obama said, \"Well, I know it was \"The New Yorker\"'s attempt at satire... I don't think they were entirely successful\". He pointed to his efforts to debunk the allegations the cover depicted, saying that the allegations were \"actually an insult against Muslim-Americans\". \"The Daily Show\" continued \"The New Yorker\" cover's argument about Obama stereotypes with a piece showcasing clips containing such stereotypes culled from legitimate news sources. On October 3, 2008, \"Entertainment Weekly\" magazine published a parody of the cover, featuring Jon Stewart as Barack and Stephen Colbert as Michelle.\n\"New Yorker\" covers are sometimes unrelated to the contents, or only tangentially related. The article about Obama in the issue with Blitt's cover did not discuss the attacks and rumors, but rather Obama's career. The magazine later endorsed Obama for president.\n2013 Bert and Ernie cover.\nOn July 8, 2013, \"The New Yorker\" featured a cover image by artist Jack Hunter, titled \"Moment of Joy\", depicting \"Sesame Street\" characters Bert and Ernie; the issue in particular covered the Supreme Court decisions on the Defense of Marriage Act and California Proposition 8. Bert and Ernie have long been rumored in urban legend to be romantic partners, but Sesame Workshop has denied this, saying they are merely \"puppets\" and have no sexual orientation. \"Slate\" criticized the cover, which shows Ernie leaning on Bert's shoulder as they watch a television with the Supreme Court justices on the screen, saying, \"it's a terrible way to commemorate a major civil-rights victory for gay and lesbian couples\". \"The Huffington Post\", meanwhile, said it was \"one of [the magazine's] most awesome covers of all time\".\n2023 \"Race for Office\" cover.\nThe cover from October 2, 2023, titled \"The Race for Office\", depicts top politicians\u2014Donald Trump, Mitch McConnell, Nancy Pelosi, and Joe Biden\u2014running the titular race for office with walkers. Many had questioned the mental and physical states of these and other older politicians, particularly those who have run for reelection. While many acknowledged the cover as satirizing this issue, others criticized the \"ableism and ageism\" of mocking older people and those who use walkers. \"The New Yorker\" said the cover \"portrays the irony and absurdity of the advanced-age politicians currently vying for our top offices\".\nStyle.\n\"The New Yorker\"'s signature display typeface, used for its nameplate and headlines and the masthead above \"The Talk of the Town\" section, is named Irvin, named after its creator, the designer-illustrator Rea Irvin. The body text of all articles is set in Adobe Caslon.\nOne uncommonly formal feature of the magazine's in-house style is the placement of diaeresis marks in words with repeating vowels\u2014such as \"re\u00eblected\", \"pre\u00ebminent\", and \"co\u00f6perate\"\u2014in which the two vowel letters indicate separate vowel sounds. The magazine also continues to use a few spellings that are otherwise little used in American English, such as \"fuelled\", \"focussed\", \"venders\", \"teen-ager\", \"traveller\", \"marvellous\", \"carrousel\", and \"cannister\".\nThe magazine also spells out the names of numerical amounts, such as \"two million three hundred thousand dollars\" instead of \"$2.3\u00a0million\", even for very large figures.\nFact-checking.\nIn 1927, \"The New Yorker\" ran an article about Edna St. Vincent Millay that contained multiple factual errors, and her mother threatened to sue the publication for libel. Consequently, the magazine developed extensive fact-checking procedures, which became integral to its reputation as early as the 1940s. In 2019, the \"Columbia Journalism Review\" said that \"no publication has been more consistently identified with its rigorous fact-checking\". As of 2025, about 30 people work in the fact-checking department.\nAt least two defamation lawsuits have been filed over articles published in the magazine, though neither were won by the plaintiff. Two 1983 articles by Janet Malcolm about Sigmund Freud's legacy led to a lawsuit from writer Jeffrey Moussaieff Masson, who claimed that Malcolm had fabricated quotes attributed to him. After years of proceedings and appeals, a jury found in Malcolm's favor in 1994. In 2010, David Grann wrote an article for the magazine about art expert Peter Paul Biro that scrutinized and expressed skepticism about Biro's stated methods to identify forgeries. Biro sued \"The New Yorker\" for defamation, alongside multiple other news outlets that reported on the article, but the case was summarily dismissed.\nReadership.\n\"The New Yorker\" is read nationwide, with 53% of its circulation in the top 10 U.S. metropolitan areas.\nAccording to a 2009 survey-based estimate of magazine audiences by MediaMark Research, the average \"New Yorker\" reader was 47.8 years old, with a household income of $91,359. In the same period, the average household income in the United States was $58,898.\nPolitically, the magazine's readership holds generally liberal views. According to a 2014 Pew Research Center survey, 77% of \"The New Yorker\"'s readers have left-of-center political values, and 52% of them hold \"consistently liberal\" political values.\nList of books about \"The New Yorker\".\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nFilms about \"The New Yorker\".\nIn \"Mrs. Parker and the Vicious Circle\", a film about the Algonquin Round Table starring Jennifer Jason Leigh as Dorothy Parker, Sam Robards portrays founding editor Harold Ross trying to drum up support for his fledgling publication.\nThe magazine's former editor, William Shawn, is portrayed in \"Capote\" (2005), \"Infamous\" (2006), and \"Hannah Arendt\" (2012).\nThe 2015 documentary \"Very Semi-Serious\", directed by Leah Wolchok and produced by Wolchok and Davina Pardo (Redora Films), presents a behind-the-scenes look at the cartoons of \"The New Yorker\".\nExplanatory notes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "31368", "revid": "27823944", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31368", "title": "T. H. White", "text": "English author (1906\u20131964)\nTerence Hanbury \"Tim\" White (29 May 1906 \u2013 17 January 1964) was an English writer. He is best known for his Arthurian novels, which were published together in 1958 as \"The Once and Future King\". One of his best known is the first of the series, \"The Sword in the Stone\", which was published as a stand-alone book in 1938.\nEarly life.\nWhite was born in Bombay, British India, to Garrick Hanbury White, a superintendent in the Indian police, and Constance Edith Southcote Aston. His parents moved with him to England in 1911. White had a troubled childhood, with an alcoholic father and an emotionally cold mother, and his parents separated when he was 14.\nEducation and teaching.\nWhite went to Cheltenham College in Gloucestershire, a public school, and Queens' College, Cambridge, where he was tutored by the scholar and occasional author L. J. Potts, who became a lifelong friend and correspondent. White later referred to him as \"the great literary influence in my life.\" While at Queens' College, White wrote a thesis on Thomas Malory's \"Le Morte d'Arthur\", and graduated in 1928 with a first-class degree in English.\nWhite then taught at Stowe School in Buckinghamshire for four years. In 1936 he published \"England Have My Bones\", a well-received memoir about a year spent in England. The same year, he left Stowe School and lived in a workman's cottage nearby, where he wrote and \"revert[ed] to a feral state\", engaging in falconry, hunting, and fishing. White also became interested in aviation, partly to conquer his fear of heights.\nWriting.\nWhite's novel \"Earth Stopped\" (1934) and its sequel \"Gone to Ground\" (1935) are science fiction novels about a disaster that devastates the world. \"Gone to Ground\" contains several fantasy stories told by the survivors that were later reprinted in \"The Maharajah and Other Stories\".\nWhite wrote to a friend that, in autumn 1937, \"I got desperate among my books and picked [Malory] up in lack of anything else. Then I was thrilled and astonished to find that (a) The thing was a perfect tragedy, with a beginning, a middle and an end implicit in the beginning and (b) the characters were real people with recognizable reactions which could be forecast.\u00a0... Anyway, I somehow started writing a book.\"\nThe novel, which White described as \"a preface to Malory\", was titled \"The Sword in the Stone\" and published in 1938, telling the story of the boyhood of King Arthur. White was also influenced by Freudian psychology and his own lifelong involvement in natural history. \"The Sword in the Stone\" was critically well-received and was a Book of the Month Club selection in 1939.\nIn February 1939, White moved to Doolistown in County Meath, Ireland, where he lived out the Second World War as a \"de facto\" conscientious objector. During his stay in Ireland, White lived with an Irish couple, Paddy and Lena McDonagh, who continued to correspond with White after he had left the country. During his stay in Ireland, White met the Irish writers Frank O'Connor and Lord Dunsany. In Ireland, he wrote most of what became \"The Once and Future King\": \"The Witch in the Wood\" (later cut and rewritten as \"The Queen of Air and Darkness\") in 1939, and \"The Ill-Made Knight\" in 1940. The version of \"The Sword in the Stone\" included in \"The Once and Future King\" differs from the earlier version; it is darker, and some critics prefer the earlier version.\nLater life.\nIn 1946, White settled in Alderney, the third-largest Channel Island, where he lived for the rest of his life. The same year, he published \"Mistress Masham's Repose\", a children's book in which a young girl discovers a group of Lilliputians (the tiny people in Jonathan Swift's \"Gulliver's Travels\") living near her house. \"Mistress Masham's Repose\" was influenced by John Masefield's book \"The Midnight Folk\". In 1947, he published \"The Elephant and the Kangaroo\", a novel in which a repetition of Noah's Flood occurs in Ireland. \"The Elephant and the Kangaroo\" provoked an angry reaction from Irish and Irish-American readers. These critics claimed that \"The Elephant and the Kangaroo\" depicted Irish people as being stupid and lazy, and that the book also contained an insulting depiction of Irish Catholicism. The Manhattan newspaper \"The Irish Echo\" described \"The Elephant and the Kangaroo\" as \"just another typical English stab in the back.\" A copy of the book was given to the McDonagh family, who found the book hurtful, due to the fact that White had based two of the characters in \"The Elephant and the Kangaroo\" on them. As a result of \"The Elephant and the Kangaroo\", the McDonaghs terminated their friendship with White.\nIn the early 1950s, he published two non-fiction books. \"The Age of Scandal\" (1950) is a collection of essays about 18th-century England. \"The Goshawk\" (1951) is an account of his attempt to train a northern goshawk using traditional rather than modern falconry techniques. He wrote it at his cottage in the mid-1930s, but he did not publish it until his agent David Garnett discovered it and insisted that it be published. In 1954, White translated and edited \"The Book of Beasts\", an English translation of a medieval bestiary written in Latin.\nIn 1958, White completed the fourth book of \"The Once and Future King\", \"The Candle in the Wind\", which was first published with the other three parts and has never been published separately. White lived to see his Arthurian work adapted as the Broadway musical \"Camelot\" (1960) and the animated film \"The Sword in the Stone\" (1963).\nDeath.\nWhite died of heart failure on 17 January 1964 aboard ship in Piraeus, Athens, Greece, en route to Alderney from a lecture tour in the United States. He is buried in the First Cemetery of Athens. \"The Book of Merlyn\" was published posthumously in 1977 as a conclusion to \"The Once and Future King\". His papers are held by the University of Texas at Austin.\nPersonal life.\nAccording to Sylvia Townsend Warner's 1967 biography, White was \"a homosexual and a sado-masochist.\" He came close to marrying several times but had no enduring romantic relationships. In his diaries of Zed, a young boy, he wrote: \"I have fallen in love with Zed\u00a0... the whole situation is an impossible one. All I can do is behave like a gentleman. It has been my hideous fate to be born with an infinite capacity for love and joy with no hope of using them.\"\nRobert Robinson published an account of a conversation with White in which White claimed to be attracted to women. Robinson concluded that this was a cover for homosexuality. Julie Andrews wrote in her autobiography, \"I believe Tim may have been an unfulfilled homosexual, and he suffered a lot because of it.\"\nHowever, White's long-time friend and literary agent David Higham wrote, \"Tim was no homosexual, though I think at one time he had feared he was (and in his ethos fear would have been the word).\" Higham gave Sylvia Townsend Warner the address of one of White's lovers \"so that she could get in touch with someone so important in Tim's story. But she never, the girl told me, took that step. So she was able to present Tim in such a light that a reviewer could call him a raging homosexual. Perhaps a heterosexual affair would have made her blush.\"\nLin Carter portrays White in \"Imaginary Worlds\" as a man who felt deeply but was unable to form close human relationships because of his unfortunate childhood. \"He was a man with an enormous capacity for loving. It shows in his prodigious correspondence and in his affection for dogs, and in the bewildered and inarticulate loves his characters experience in his books; but he had few close friends, and no genuine relationship with a woman.\"\nWhite was agnostic and a heavy drinker towards the end of his life. Warner wrote of him, \"Notably free from fearing God, he was basically afraid of the human race.\"\nInfluence.\nFantasy writer Michael Moorcock enjoyed White's \"The Once and Future King\", and was especially influenced by the underpinnings of realism in his work. Moorcock eventually engaged in a \"wonderful correspondence\" with White, and later recalled that White gave him \"some very good advice on how to write\".\nJ. K. Rowling has said that White's writing strongly influenced the \"Harry Potter\" books; several critics have compared Rowling's character Albus Dumbledore to White's absent-minded Merlyn, and Rowling herself has described White's Wart as \"Harry's spiritual ancestor.\" Author Neil Gaiman was asked about the similarities between Harry Potter and Gaiman's character Timothy Hunter, and he stated that he did not think Rowling had based her character on Hunter. \"I said to [the reporter] that I thought we were both just stealing from T. H. White: very straightforward.\"\nGregory Maguire was influenced by \"White's ability to be intellectually broadminded, to be comic, to be poetic, and to be fantastic\" in the writing of his 1995 novel \"Wicked\", and crime fiction writer Ed McBain also cited White as an influence.\nWhite features extensively in Helen Macdonald's \"H is for Hawk\", winner of the 2014 Samuel Johnson Prize for non-fiction. One of the components of the book is a biographical account of White and also \"The Goshawk\", an account of his own attempt to train a hawk.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "31369", "revid": "1312733705", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31369", "title": "The Lizard", "text": "Peninsula in southern Cornwall, England\nThe Lizard () is a peninsula in southern Cornwall, England, United Kingdom. The southernmost point of the British mainland is near Lizard Point at SW 701115; The Lizard, also known as Lizard village, is the most southerly region on the British mainland, and is in the civil parish of Landewednack. The valleys of the Helford River, and the lake known as Loe Pool form the northern boundary, with the rest of the peninsula surrounded by sea. The area measures about . The Lizard is one of England's natural regions and has been designated as a National Character Area 157 by Natural England. The peninsula is known for its geology and for its rare plants and lies within the Cornwall National Landscape, an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB), also known as a \"National Landscape\".\nThe Lizard's coast is particularly hazardous to shipping and the seaways round the peninsula were historically known as the \"Graveyard of Ships\". The Lizard Lighthouse was constructed at Lizard Point in 1752, and the RNLI operates the Lizard lifeboat station.\nEtymology.\nThe name \"Lizard\" is most probably a corruption of the Cornish name \"Lys Ardh\", meaning \"high court\"; it is purely coincidental that much of the peninsula is composed of serpentinite-bearing rock. The peninsula's original name may have been the Celtic \"Bridanoc\", from \"Britannakon\" (\"the British one\"), preserved in the name of the former village of Predannack, now site of Predannack Airfield.\nHistory.\nThere is evidence of early habitation with several burial mounds and stones. Part of the peninsula is known as the Meneage (land of the monks).\nHelston, the nearest town to the Lizard peninsula, is said to have once headed the estuary of the River Cober, before it was cut off from the sea by Loe Bar in the 13th century. It is speculated that Helston was once a port, but no records exist. Geomorphologists believe the bar was most likely formed by rising sea levels, after the last ice age, blocking the river and creating a barrier beach. The beach is formed mostly of flint and the nearest source is found offshore under the drowned terraces of the former river that flowed between England and France, and now under the English Channel. The medieval port of Helston was at Gweek, possibly from around 1260 onward, on the Helford River which exported tin and copper. Helston was believed to be in existence in the sixth century, around the River Cober (\"Dowr Kohar\").\nThe name comes from the Cornish \"hen lys\" or \"old court\" and \"ton\" added later to denote a Saxon manor; the Domesday Book refers to it as Henliston (which survives as the name of a road in the town). It was granted its charter by King John in 1201. It was here that tin ingots were weighed to determine the duty due to the Duke of Cornwall when a number of stannary towns were authorised by royal decree.\nThe royal manor of Winnianton, which was held by King William I at the time of the Domesday Book (1086), was also the head manor of the hundred of Kerrier and the largest estate in Cornwall. It was assessed as having fifteen hides before 1066. At the time of Domesday there was land for sixty ploughs, but in the lord's land there were two ploughs and in the lands held by villeins twenty-four ploughs. There were twenty-four villeins, forty-one freedmen, thirty-three smallholders and fourteen slaves. There was , eight square leagues of pasture and half a square league of woodland. The livestock was fourteen unbroken mares, three cattle and one hundred and twenty-eight sheep (in total 145 beasts); its value was \u00a312 annually. 11 of the hides were held by the Count of Mortain and there is more arable and pasture and 13 more persons are recorded: Rinsey, Trelowarren, Mawgan-in-Meneage and seventeen other lands are also recorded under Winnianton.\nMullion has the 15th century church of St Mellanus, and the Old Inn from the 16th century. The harbour was completed in 1895 and financed by Lord Robartes of Lanhydrock as a recompense to the fishermen for several disastrous pilchard seasons.\nThe small church of St Peter in Coverack, built in 1885 for \u00a3500, has a serpentinite pulpit.\nThe Great Western Railway operated a road motor service to the Lizard from Helston railway station. Commencing on 17 August 1903, it was the first successful British railway-run bus service and was initially provided as a cheaper alternative to a proposed light railway.\nThe Solar eclipse of 11 August 1999 departed the UK mainland from the Lizard.\nThe transatlantic record run of the unaccompanied one hand sailor Thomas Coville within less than 5 days in his sailboat \"Sodebo Ultim\" from New York to Europe landed here on 15 July 2017.\nNautical.\nThe Lizard has been the site of many maritime disasters. It forms a natural obstacle to entry and exit of Falmouth and its naturally deep estuary.\nAt Lizard Point stands the Lizard Lighthouse, where a light was erected by Sir John Killigrew at his own expense. It was built at the cost of \"20 nobles a year\" for 30 years, and caused many problems over the following years, as King James I considered charging vessels to pass. Thus, the lighthouse was demolished. It was rebuilt in 1751 by order of Thomas Fonnereau and remains almost unchanged today. Further east lie The Manacles, near Porthoustock: of jagged rocks just beneath the waves.\nThe biggest rescue in the RNLI's history was 17 March 1907 when the 12,000-tonne liner hit the Maenheere Reef near Lizard Point in Cornwall. In a strong gale and dense fog RNLI lifeboat volunteers rescued 456 passengers, including 70 babies. Crews from the Lizard, Cadgwith, Coverack and Porthleven rowed out repeatedly for 16 hours to rescue all of the people on board. Six silver RNLI medals were later awarded, two to \"Suevic\" crew members.\nThe Battle at the Lizard, a naval battle, took place off the Lizard on 21 October 1707.\nSmuggling was a regular, and often necessary, way of life in these parts, despite the efforts of coastguards or \"Preventive men\". In 1801, the king's pardon was offered to any smuggler giving information on the Mullion musket men involved in a gunfight with the crew of HM Gun Vessel \"Hecate\".\nAeronautical.\nIn the First World War a Naval Air Station, RNAS Mullion, was established at Bonython, flying mainly blimps used for spotting U-boats. One was sunk and several probably damaged by bombs dropped by the blimps. The airfield site is now occupied by the wind farm.\nRAF Predannack was a Second World War airbase, from which Coastal Command squadrons flew anti-submarine sorties into the Bay of Biscay as well as convoy support in the western English Channel. The runways still exist and the site is used by a local Air Cadet Volunteergliding Squadron 626VGS and as an emergency/relief base for RNAS Culdrose (HMS \"Seahawk\").\nRNAS Culdrose is Europe's largest helicopter base, and currently hosts the Training and Operational Conversion Unit operating the EH101 \"Merlin\" helicopter. It is also the home base for Merlin Squadrons embarked upon Royal Navy warships, the Westland Sea King airborne early warning (AEW) variant helicopter, a Search And Rescue (Sea King, again) helicopter flight, and some BAe Hawk T.1 trainer jets used for training purposes by the Royal Navy. The base also operates some other types of fixed wing aircraft for calibration and other training purposes. As befits the base's name, a non-flying example of a Hawker Sea Hawk forms the main gate guardian static display. RNAS Culdrose is a major contributor to the economy of the Lizard area.\nPolitical.\nThe Lizard peninsula is in the St Ives parliamentary constituency, which comprises the whole of the former district of Penwith and the southern part of the former district of Kerrier). The parishes northeast of the river Helford are in Camborne and Redruth parliamentary constituency\nTo the north, the Lizard peninsula is bordered by the civil parishes of Breage, Porthleven, Sithney, Helston, Wendron, Gweek and\u00a0\u2013 across the Helford River\u00a0\u2013 by Constantine, Kerrier and Mawnan.\nThe parishes on the peninsula proper are (west to east):\nThe Lizard's political history includes the 1497 Cornish rebellion which began in St Keverne. The village blacksmith Michael Joseph (Michael \"An Gof\" in Cornish, meaning blacksmith) led the uprising, protesting against the punitive taxes levied by Henry VII to pay for the war against the Scots. The uprising was routed on its march to London and the two leaders, Michael Joseph and Thomas Flamank, were subsequently hanged, drawn and quartered.\nTechnological.\nTitanium was discovered here by the Reverend William Gregor in 1791.\nIn 1869, John Pender formed the Falmouth Gibraltar and Malta Telegraph company, intending to connect India to England with an undersea cable. Although intended to land at Falmouth, the final landing point was Porthcurno near Land's End.\nIn 1900 Guglielmo Marconi stayed at the Housel Bay Hotel in his quest to locate a coastal radio station to receive signals from ships equipped with his apparatus. He leased a plot \"in the wheat field adjoining the hotel\" where the Lizard Wireless Telegraph Station still stands today. Recently restored by the National Trust, it looks as it did in January 1901, when Marconi received the distance record signals of from his transmitter station at Niton, Isle of Wight. The Lizard Wireless Station is the oldest Marconi station to survive in its original state, and is located to the west of the Lloyds Signal Station in what appears to be a wooden hut. On 12 December 1901 Marconi's Poldhu Wireless Station at Poldhu Point was the site of the first trans Atlantic, wireless signal radio communication when Marconi sent a signal to St John's, Newfoundland. The technology is one of the key advances to the development of radio, television, satellites and the internet.\nAn early-warning radar station called RAF Dry Tree was built on Goonhilly Downs during World War II. The site was later chosen for the Telstar project in 1962; its rocky foundations, clear atmosphere and extreme southerly location being uniquely suitable. This became the Goonhilly Satellite Earth Station, now owned by Goonhilly Earth Station Ltd. Some important developments in television satellite transmission were made at Goonhilly station.\nA wind farm exists near to the Goonhilly station site.\nGeology.\nKnown as the Lizard complex, the peninsula's geology is the best preserved example of an exposed ophiolite in the United Kingdom.\nAn ophiolite is a suite of geological formations which represent a slice through a section of ocean crust (including the upper level of the mantle) thrust onto the continental crust.\nThe Lizard formations comprise three main units; the serpentinites, the \"oceanic complex\" and the metamorphic basement. The serpentinite contains significant samples of the serpentine polymorph lizardite, which were named after the Lizard complex in 1955.\nEcology.\nSeveral nature sites exist on the Lizard Peninsula; Predannack nature reserve, Mullion Island, Goonhilly Downs, and the Cornish Seal Sanctuary at Gweek. An area of the Lizard covering is designated a national nature reserve because of its coastal grasslands and heaths and inland heaths. The peninsula contains 3 main Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI), both noted for their endangered insects and plants, as well as their geology. The first is East Lizard Heathlands SSSI, the second is \"Caerthillian to Kennack SSSI\" and the third is West Lizard SSSI, of which the important wetland, Hayle Kimbro Pool, forms a part of.\nThe area is also home to one of England's rarest breeding birds\u00a0\u2014 the Cornish chough. This species of corvid is distinctive due to its red beak and legs and haunting \"chee-aw\" call. Choughs were extinct in Cornwall but returned naturally in 2001 and began breeding on Lizard in 2002 following a concerted effort by the National Trust, English Nature and the RSPB.\nThe Lizard contains some of the most specialised flora of any area in Britain, including many Red Data Book plant species. Of particular note is the Cornish heath, \"Erica vagans\", that occurs in abundance here, but which is found nowhere else in Britain. There are more than 600 species of flowering plants on the Lizard, nearly a quarter of all UK species. The reason for this richness is partly because of the many different and unusual Lizard rocks on the Lizard Peninsula. But above all, it is a coming together of multiple factors: a very mild maritime climate, but one prone to gales and salt winds; waterlogged and boggy soils, but ones that often parch and dry out in the summer; soils of greatly contrasting fertility and pH; and lastly man's influence. Any single factor taken on its own would influence the flora; taken together, they combine, overlap and interact. Contrasting plant communities grow side-by-side in a mosaic that changes within a few metres but also changes markedly over time with the cycle of heath fires. It's not so much that conditions are ideal for growth, but that there is such a variety of different, difficult conditions. Each habitat, with its own combination of factors, attracts its own specialist plants. It is also one of the few places where the rare formicine ant, \"Formica exsecta\", (the narrow-headed ant), can be found.\nIn pop culture.\nDaphne du Maurier based many novels on this part of Cornwall, including \"Frenchman's Creek\".\nThe Lizard was featured on the BBC television programme \"Seven Natural Wonders\" as one of the wonders of the South West, and on the BBC series \"Coast\".\nIn James Clavell's novel \"Sh\u014dgun\", ship's pilot Vasco Rodrigues challenges John Blackthorne to recite the latitude of the Lizard to verify that Blackthorne is the Pilot of the Dutch vessel \"Erasmus\".\nThe Jennifer McQuiston 2015 novel \"The Spinster's Guide to Scandalous Behavior\" is set primarily in the fictional village Lizard Bay on the Lizard in the mid-nineteenth century.\nIn the television adaptation of \"Horatio Hornblower\", an order is given to \"Weather the Lizard\" in the episode \"Hornblower:Mutiny\".\n\"Lizard Point\" is also a track on the 1982 album \"\" released by Brian Eno.\nThe book series \"Fenton House\" by Ben Cheetham is set on the Lizard Peninsula.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Taking place in 1586 in the Sengoku period of Japanese history, it follows the story of a village of desperate farmers who seek to hire samurai to combat bandits who will return after the harvest to steal their crops.\nAt the time, the film was the most expensive film made in Japan. It took a year to shoot and faced many difficulties. It was the second-highest-grossing domestic film in Japan in 1954. Many reviews compared the film to the Western film genre.\n\"Seven Samurai\" is regarded as one of the greatest and most influential films in cinema history. Since its release, it has consistently ranked highly in critics' lists of greatest films, such as the BFI's \"Sight &amp; Sound\" and Rotten Tomatoes polls. It was also voted the greatest foreign-language film of all time in the BBC's 2018 international critics' poll. It is regarded as one of the most \"remade, reworked, and referenced\" films in cinema.\nPlot.\nIn 1586, a bandit gang discusses raiding a mountain village, but their chief decides to wait until after the harvest for a better haul. The villagers overhear this and turn to Gisaku, the village elder and miller. Because the local magistrate is useless, Gisaku plans to hire samurai to protect the village. Since they have no money and can only offer food as payment, Gisaku advises the villagers to find \"hungry\" samurai.\nTraveling to a nearby town, the villagers find Kambei, an aging but experienced r\u014dnin, whom they see rescuing a young boy from a thief. A young samurai named Katsushir\u014d asks to become Kambei's disciple. The villagers ask for Kambei's help, and he reluctantly agrees by saying that defense will be tougher than offense. He then recruits his old comrade-in-arms Shichir\u014dji, along with Gorobei, Heihachi, and Ky\u016bz\u014d, a taciturn master swordsman whom Katsushir\u014d regards with awe. Kikuchiyo, a wild and eccentric samurai-poser, is eventually accepted as well after attempts to drive him away fail.\nArriving at the village, the samurai and farmers slowly begin to trust each other. Katsushir\u014d meets Shino, a farmer's daughter disguised as a boy by her father, and begins a relationship with her despite knowing the difference in their social classes prohibits it. Later, the samurai are angered when Kikuchiyo brings them armor and weapons, which the villagers acquired by killing other samurai injured or fleeing from battle. Kikuchiyo angrily retorts that samurai are responsible for much of the suffering farmers endure, revealing he is an orphaned farmer's son. The samurais' anger turns to shame.\nKambei arms the villagers with bamboo spears, organizes them into squads, and trains them. Three bandit scouts are spotted; two are killed, while the last reveals their camp's location before the villagers execute him. The samurai burn down the camp in a pre-emptive strike. Rikichi, a troubled villager aiding the samurai, breaks down when he sees his wife, who was kidnapped and made a concubine during a previous raid. Upon seeing Rikichi, she runs back into a burning hut to her death. Heihachi is killed by a gunshot while trying to stop Rikichi from pursuing her. At Heihachi's funeral, the saddened villagers are inspired by Kikuchiyo, who raises a banner Heihachi made to represent the six samurai, Kikuchiyo, and the village.\nWhen the bandits finally arrive, they are confounded by the new fortifications, which include a moat and high wooden fences. They burn the village's outlying houses, including Gisaku's mill. Gisaku's family tries to save him when he refuses to abandon it, but all perish except a baby rescued by Kikuchiyo. The bandits then besiege the village, but many are killed as the defenders thwart every attack.\nThe bandits possess three matchlock muskets. Ky\u016bz\u014d ventures out alone and captures one; an envious Kikuchiyo abandons his squad to bring back another. However, Kikuchiyo's absence allows a handful of bandits to infiltrate his post and kill several farmers, and Gorobei is slain defending his position. That night, Kambei predicts that the bandits will make one final assault due to their dwindling numbers.\nMeanwhile, Katsushir\u014d and Shino's relationship is discovered by her father, who is enraged that her virginity has been taken and beats her. Kambei and the villagers intervene; Shichir\u014dji reasons that such behavior is normal before battle and that the couple should be forgiven.\nThe next morning, the defenders allow the remaining bandits to enter the village and ambush them. As the battle nears its end, the bandit chief hides in the women's hut and shoots and kills Ky\u016bz\u014d with his musket. An enraged Kikuchiyo charges in and is shot as well, but kills the chief before dying. The remaining outlaws are slain.\nAfterward, Kambei, Katsushir\u014d and Shichir\u014dji stand in front of the funeral mounds of their comrades, watching the joyful villagers sing while planting their crops. Katsushir\u014d and Shino meet one last time, but Shino walks past him to join in the planting while Katsushir\u014d despondently watches her. Kambei declares to Shichir\u014dji that it is another pyrrhic victory for the samurai: \"The victory belongs to those peasants. Not to us.\"\nProduction.\nWriting.\nAkira Kurosawa had originally wanted to direct a film about a single day in the life of a samurai. Later, in the course of his research, he discovered a story about samurai defending farmers. According to actor Toshiro Mifune, the film was originally going to be called \"Six Samurai\", with Mifune playing the role of Ky\u016bz\u014d. During the six-week scriptwriting process, Kurosawa and his screenwriters realized that \"six sober samurai were a bore\u2014they needed a character that was more off-the-wall\". Kurosawa recast Mifune as Kikuchiyo and gave him creative license to improvise in his performance. During the six-week scriptwriting process, the screenwriters were not allowed visitors or phone calls.\nKurosawa and the writers were innovative in refining the theme of the assembly of heroic characters to perform a mission. According to Michael Jeck's DVD commentary, \"Seven Samurai\" was among the first films to use the now-common plot element of the recruiting and gathering of heroes into a team to accomplish a specific goal, a device used in later films such as \"The Guns of Navarone\", \"Sholay\", the western remake \"The Magnificent Seven\", and Pixar's animated film \"A Bug's Life\". Film critic Roger Ebert speculates in his review that the sequence introducing the leader Kambei (in which the samurai shaves off his topknot, a sign of honor among samurai, in order to pose as a monk to rescue a boy from a kidnapper) could be the origin of the practice, now common in action movies, of introducing the main hero with an undertaking unrelated to the main plot.\nOther plot devices such as the reluctant hero, romance between a local woman and the youngest hero, and the nervousness of the common citizenry, had appeared in other films before this, but were combined in this film.\nSet design.\nKurosawa refused to shoot the peasant village at Toho Studios and had a complete set constructed at Tagata on the Izu Peninsula, Shizuoka. Although the studio protested against the increased production costs, Kurosawa was adamant that \"the quality of the set influences the quality of the actors' performances... For this reason, I have the sets made exactly like the real thing. It restricts the shooting but encourages that feeling of authenticity.\"\nHe also spoke of the \"intense labour\" of making the film: \"It rained all the time; we didn't have enough horses. It was just the kind of picture that is impossible to make in this country.\"\nFilming.\nLong before it was released, the film had already become a topic of wide discussion. After three months of pre-production, it had 148 shooting days spread out over a year\u2014four times the span covered in the original budget, which eventually came to almost half a million dollars. Toho Studios closed down production at least twice. Each time, Kurosawa calmly went fishing, reasoning that the studio had already heavily invested in the production and would allow him to complete the picture. The film's final battle scene, originally scheduled to be shot at the end of summer, was shot in February in near-freezing temperatures. Mifune later recalled that he had never been so cold in his life.\nDuring filming for the scene where the samurai arrive at the village, Kurosawa set up a shot at the top of the mountain from which the village could be seen in the valley. In order for this to work as an evening shot, the crew spent the entire day setting up for the single shot, but cameraman Asakazu Nakai and Kurosawa ended up debating when to start shooting the scene by looking at the light through the camera's viewfinder. Despite spending the entire day preparing, Nakai's hesitation to start shooting caused the sun to set and the scene wasn't shot.\nThrough the creative freedom provided by the studio, Kurosawa made use of telephoto lenses, which were rare in 1954, as well as multiple cameras which allowed the action to fill the screen and place the audience right in the middle of it. \"If I had filmed it in the traditional shot-by-shot method, there was no guarantee that any action could be repeated in exactly the same way twice.\" He found it to be very effective and he later used it in movies that were less action-oriented. His method was to put one camera in the most orthodox shooting position, another camera for quick shots and a third camera \"as a kind of guerrilla unit\". This method made for very complicated shoots, for which Kurosawa choreographed the movement of all three cameras by using diagrams.\nThe martial arts choreography for the film was led by Yoshio Sugino of the Tenshin Sh\u014dden Katori Shint\u014d-ry\u016b. Initially Junzo Sasamori of the Ono-ha Itto-ryu worked with Sugino, but he was asked by the Ministry of Education to teach in Europe during production.\nEditing.\nDuring filming, Kurosawa quickly earned a reputation with his crew as the \"world's greatest editor\" because of his practice of editing late at night throughout the shooting. He described this as a practical necessity that is incomprehensible to most directors, who on major productions spent at least several months with their editors assembling and cutting the film after shooting is completed.\nSoundtrack.\nKurosawa had a heightened interest in the soundtracks of his films. For \"Seven Samurai\", he collaborated for the seventh and penultimate time with friend and composer Fumio Hayasaka. Hayasaka was already seriously ill when Kurosawa visited him during the filming of \"Seven Samurai\" and he died of tuberculosis on October 15, 1955, at the age of 41, while Kurosawa was filming \"I Live in Fear\", his next film, which Hayasaka was unable to complete.\nThemes.\nIn analyzing the film's accuracy to sixteenth century Japan, Philip Kemp discusses the similarities between the samurai and the bandits.\nKenneth Turan notes that the long runtime \"reflects the entirety of the agricultural year, from planting to gorgeous blossoming to harvesting.\" Historian David Conrad notes that at the time of the movie's release, nearly half of the Japanese population was still employed in agriculture. Although farm incomes were already rising as part of the Japanese economic miracle that would transform rural and urban lives in the 1950s and 60s, many of the village conditions depicted in the movie were still familiar to audiences in 1954.\nRelease.\nTheatrical.\nAt 207 minutes, including a five-minute intermission with music, \"Seven Samurai\" was the longest film that had been released in Kurosawa's career. Fearing that international audiences would be unwilling to sit through the entire picture, Toho Studios, alongside Kurosawa himself, originally removed 50 minutes from the film for international distribution &amp; reshowing in Japan. This \"General Release\" cut distributed around the world until the 1990s; since then, the complete version is usually seen.\nThe film was released in the United States in 1955, initially under the title \"The Magnificent Seven\". Following the 1960 release of the American remake \"The Magnificent Seven\", the Japanese film's title reverted to its original \"Seven Samurai\" in the United States.\nHome media.\nPrior to the advent of DVD, various edited versions were distributed on video, but most DVDs and Blu-rays contain Kurosawa's complete original version, including its five-minute intermission. Since 2006, the Criterion Collection's US releases have featured their own exclusive 2K restoration, whereas most others, including all non-US Blu-rays, have an older HD transfer from Toho in Japan.\n4K restoration.\nIn 2016, Toho carried out a six-month-long 4K restoration, along with Kurosawa's \"Ikiru\" (1952). As the whereabouts of \"Seven Samurai\"'s original negative are unknown, second-generation fine-grain positive and third-generation duplicate negative elements were used. It is available as a Digital Cinema Package from the British Film Institute. This version was first released on 4K Blu-ray in Japan as standard-dynamic-range video in June 2023 and was released on home video by the British Film Institute.\nReception.\nBox office.\n\"Seven Samurai\" was well received by Japanese audiences, earning a distribution rental income of \u00a5, within the first twelve months of its release. It was Japan's third-highest-grossing film of 1954, out-grossing \"Godzilla\", which had sold 9.7 million tickets and grossed an inflation-adjusted equivalent of \u00a5 or $ by 1998.\nOverseas, the box-office income for the film's 1956 North American release is currently unknown. The film's 2002 re-release grossed $271,841 in the United States and $4,124 in France. At the 2002 Kurosawa &amp; Mifune Festival in the United States, the film grossed $561,692. This adds up to at least $833,533 grossed in the United States. Other European re-releases between 1997-2018 sold 27,627 tickets.\nCritical response.\n\"Seven Samurai\" was released to broadly positive reviews in the West, but film scholar Stuart Galbraith IV has noted it received \"praise from American critics, but praise tainted by cultural condescension\" for its perceived similarities to the American Western; nevertheless, it is now considered one of the greatest films in history. On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a perfect approval rating of based on 102 reviews, with an average rating of . The site's critical consensus reads: \"Arguably Akira Kurosawa's masterpiece, \"The Seven Samurai\" is an epic adventure classic with an engrossing story, memorable characters, and stunning action sequences that make it one of the most influential films ever made\". The site ranked it fourth on their \"300 Best Movies of All Time\" list in 2025, having previously ranked 8th on their action/adventure voting list and third on their top 100 art house and international films. On Metacritic, it received a 98 out of 100 based on seven critical reviews. On Spanish site SensaCine, the film received a 4.3 out of 5 based on three critical reviews.\nThe film made its international debut at the 1954 Venice Film Festival in Italy, receiving a Silver Lion award. \"Variety\" reviewed the film, stating \"High adventure and excitement are stamped all over this solid-core film\" but said \"the lone drawback is its length, which can be sheared.\" Upon its US release as \"The Magnificent Seven\" in 1956, film critic Wanda Hale reviewed the film in \"New York Daily News\" and rated it four stars. She noted it was very different from Kurosawa's previous film \"Rashomon\" (1950) in that it was \"an action picture\" but Kurosawa \"has exceeded himself\". She praised Kurosawa's storytelling for \"his deep perception of human nature\" and \"awareness that no two people are alike,\" his \"sensitive, knowing direction\" that \"never lets audiences lose interest\" in the plot, his talent for making the battle scenes and violent action \"terrifically exciting to audiences\" and his ability to naturally weave humor and romance between the serious action. She praised the \"inspired performances\" of the cast, including Takashi Shimura and Toshiro Mifune, among other actors.\nMany critics outside of Japan have compared the film to Westerns. Bosley Crowther, writing for \"The New York Times\", compared it to \"High Noon\". Film historian Peter Cowie quoted Kurosawa as saying, \"Good westerns are liked by everyone. Since humans are weak, they want to see good people and great heroes. Westerns have been done over and over again, and in the process, a kind of grammar has evolved. I have learned from this grammar of the western.\" Cowie continues this thought by saying, \"That \"Seven Samurai\" can be so seamlessly transposed to an American setting underlines how carefully Kurosawa had assimilated this grammar.\"\nIn 1982, it was voted third in the \"Sight &amp; Sound\" critics' poll of greatest films. In the 2002 \"Sight &amp; Sound\" critics' poll the film was ranked 11th. In the \"Sight &amp; Sound\" directors' poll, it was voted 10th in 1992 and number nine in 2002. It ranked 17th on the 2012 \"Sight &amp; Sound\" critics' poll, in both cases being tied with Kurosawa's own \"Rashomon\" (1950). It ranked 17th in 2012 \"Sight &amp; Sound\" directors' poll.\nIn 1998, the film was ranked 5th in \"Time Out\" magazine's Top 100 Films (Centenary). \"Entertainment Weekly\" voted it the 12th greatest film of all time in 1999. In 2000, the film was ranked at No.23 in \"The Village Voice\"'s 100 Greatest Films list. In January 2002, the film was included on the list of the \"Top 100 Essential Films of All Time\" by the National Society of Film Critics.\nIn 2007, the film was ranked at No. 3 by \"The Guardian\"'s readers' poll on its list of \"40 greatest foreign films of all time\". The film was voted at No. 57 on the list of \"100 Greatest Films\" by the prominent French magazine \"Cahiers du cin\u00e9ma\" in 2008. In 2009 the film was voted at No. 2 on the list of \"The Greatest Japanese Films of All Time\" by Japanese film magazine \"Kinema Junpo\". \"Seven Samurai\" was ranked number one on \"Empire\" magazine's list of \"The 100 Best Films of World Cinema\" in 2010.\nFilm critic Roger Ebert added it to his list of Great Movies in 2001. Martin Scorsese included it on a list of \"39 Essential Foreign Films for a Young Filmmaker.\" It was also listed by Russian filmmaker Andrei Tarkovsky as one of his top ten favorite films.\nKurosawa both directed and edited many of his films, including \"Seven Samurai\". In 2012, the Motion Picture Editors Guild listed \"Seven Samurai\" as the 33rd-best-edited film of all time based on a survey of its members. It was voted the greatest foreign-language film of all time in BBC's 2018 poll of 209 critics in 43 countries. In 2019, when \"Time Out\" polled film critics, directors, actors and stunt actors, \"Seven Samurai\" was voted the second-best action film of all time. In 2021, the film was ranked at number 7 on \"Time Out\" magazine's list of \"The 100 Best Movies of All Time\".\nHome media.\nAs of 2017, \"Seven Samurai\" is the best-selling home video title ever released by the British Film Institute.\nLegacy and cultural impact.\n\"Seven Samurai\" was a technical and creative watershed that became Japan's highest-grossing movie and set a new standard for the industry. It has remained highly influential, often seen as one of the most \"remade, reworked, referenced\" films in cinema.\nThere have been pachinko machines based on \"Seven Samurai\" in Japan. \"Seven Samurai\" pachinko machines have sold 94,000 units in Japan as of March\u00a02018[ [update]], equivalent to an estimated $ in gross revenue.\nRemakes.\nIts influence can be most strongly felt in the Western \"The Magnificent Seven\" (1960), a film specifically adapted from \"Seven Samurai\". Director John Sturges took \"Seven Samurai\" and adapted it to the Old West, with the samurai replaced by gunslingers. Many of \"The Magnificent Seven\"'s scenes mirror those of \"Seven Samurai\". The film's title itself comes from the US localized title of \"Seven Samurai\", which was initially released under the title \"The Magnificent Seven\" in the United States in 1955. However, in an interview with R. B. Gadi, Kurosawa expressed how \"the American copy of \"The Magnificent Seven\" is a disappointment, although entertaining. It is not a version of \"Seven Samurai\"\". Stephen Prince argues that considering samurai films and Westerns respond to different cultures and contexts, what Kurosawa found useful was not their content but rather he was inspired by their levels of syntactic movement, framing, form and grammar.\n\"Alamat ng 7 kilabot\" (1967) is a Filipino remake of the film directed by Armando A. Herrera, and starring Fernando Poe Jr. and Joseph Estrada.\n\"The Invincible Six\" (1970), an American action film directed by Jean Negulesco, has been described as \"a knockoff of the \"Seven Samurai\"/\"Magnificent Seven\" genre set in 1960s Iran.\"\n\"Battle Beyond the Stars\" (1980) is an American science fiction film directed by Jimmy T. Murakami and produced by Roger Corman. The film, intended as a \"\"Magnificent Seven\" in outer space\", is based on the plots of \"The Magnificent Seven\" and \"Seven Samurai\". The movie acknowledges its debt to \"Seven Samurai\" by calling the protagonist's homeworld \"Akir\" and its inhabitants the \"Akira\".\nSome film critics have noted similarities between Pixar's \"A Bug's Life\" (1998) and \"Seven Samurai\".\nSeveral elements from \"Seven Samurai\" are also argued to have been adapted for \"Star Wars\" (1977). Plot elements of \"Seven Samurai\" are also used in the \"Star Wars\" Anthology film \"Rogue One\" (2016). The \"\" episode \"Bounty Hunters\" (2008) pays direct homage to Akira Kurosawa by adapting the film's plot, as does \"The Mandalorian\" episode \"\" (2019).\nDirector Zack Snyder credited \"Seven Samurai\" as being an inspiration for his 2023 space opera film \"Rebel Moon\", which shares the plot element of villagers assembling a team of warriors to defend their farming settlement. Snyder has described the movie as \"Seven Samurai in space.\"\nDirector Denis Villeneuve cited \"Seven Samurai\" as one of his favorite films of all time and as an influence on his 2015 film \"Sicario\".\n\"Marauders\", the sixth episode of the second season of the American science fiction television series \"\" (2002), is based on \"Seven Samurai\".\nCultural impact.\n\"Seven Samurai\" is largely touted as what made the \"assembling the team\" trope popular in movies and other media. This has since become a common trope in many action movies and heist films. \"Seven Samurai\" spawned its own subgenre of \"men-on-a-mission\" films, also known as the \"\"Seven Samurai\" formula\" where \"a team of disparate characters are grouped to undertake a specific mission.\" The formula has been widely adopted by many films and other media. Along with remakes already listed above, other examples of the \"\"Seven Samurai\" formula\" can be seen in films such as \"Saving Private Ryan\" (1998), \"The Dirty Dozen\" (1967), \"Star Wars\" (1977), \"The Savage Seven\" (1968), \"The 13th Warrior\" (1999), \"The Expendables\", and \"Avengers\", as well as television series such as \"The A-Team\" and \"The Walking Dead\".\nAccording to Stephen Prince, the film's \"racing, powerful narrative engine, breathtaking pacing, and sense-assaulting visual style\" (what he calls a \"kinesthetic cinema\" approach to \"action filmmaking and exciting visual design\") was \"the clearest precursor\" and became \"the model for\" the Hollywood blockbuster \"brand of moviemaking\" that emerged in the 1970s. The visuals, plot, dialogue and film techniques of \"Seven Samurai\" inspired a wide range of filmmakers, ranging from Steven Spielberg and George Lucas to Martin Scorsese and Quentin Tarantino. According to Prince, Kurosawa was \"a mentor figure\" to an emerging generation of American filmmakers, such as Spielberg and Lucas, who went on to develop the Hollywood blockbuster format in the 1970s.\nElements from \"Seven Samurai\" have been borrowed by many films. Examples include plot elements in films such as \"Three Amigos\" (1986) by John Landis, borrowed scenes in George Miller's ' (2015), and various elements (including visual elements and the way the action, suspense and movement are presented) in the large-scale battle scenes of films such as ' (2002), \"The Matrix Revolutions\" (2003) and numerous Marvel Studios films. The opening action scene (where the hero is introduced in an action scenario unrelated to the rest of the plot) later seen in many action films (such as the pre-title scenes in \"James Bond\" films) has origins in \"Seven Samurai\", whose first action scene has Kambei posing as a monk to save a boy from a kidnapper. A visual element from \"Seven Samurai\" that has inspired a number of films is the use of rain to set the tone for action scenes; examples of this include \"Blade Runner\" (1982), \"The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers\", and \"The Matrix Revolutions\". \"Seven Samurai\"'s film editing technique of cutting on motion and the mentor\u2013student dynamics in the plot (also seen in other Kurosawa films) have also been widely adopted by Hollywood blockbusters (such as Marvel films).\n\"Sholay\" (1975), a \"Curry Western\" Indian film written by Salim\u2013Javed (Salim Khan and Javed Akhtar) and directed by Ramesh Sippy, has a plot that was loosely styled after \"Seven Samurai\". \"Sholay\" became the most commercially successful Indian film and revolutionized Hindi cinema. Later Indian films inspired by \"Seven Samurai\" include Mani Ratnam's \"Thalapathi\" (1991) and the Hindi film \"China Gate\" (1998).\nDirector Zack Snyder said, \"Bruce [Wayne] is having to go out and sort of 'Seven Samurai' the Justice League together\u201d in the 2021 film \"Zack Snyder's Justice League\". According to Bryan Young of \"Syfy Wire\", the Marvel Cinematic Universe films \"The Avengers\" (2012) and ' (2018) also owe \"a great debt to\" \"Seven Samurai\", noting a number of similar plot and visual elements. Other examples of films that reference \"Seven Samurai\" include the Australian science fiction film ' (1981), the American comedy film \"Galaxy Quest\" (1999), and the 2016 remake of \"The Magnificent Seven\".\nAmerican author Helen DeWitt's debut novel \"The Last Samurai\" heavily features \"Seven Samurai\" as the title is a reference to the movie and characters within the novel watch and respond to the movie throughout the book.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He was a central figure in the field of evolutionary biology for his work in shaping the modern synthesis and also popular for his support and promotion of theistic evolution as a practicing Christian. Born in the Russian Empire, Dobzhansky immigrated to the United States in 1927 at the age of 27.\nHis 1937 work \"Genetics and the Origin of Species\" became a major influence on the modern synthesis. He was awarded the U.S. National Medal of Science in 1964 and the Franklin Medal in 1973. He is famous for his essay \"Nothing in Biology Makes Sense Except in the Light of Evolution.\"\nBiography.\nEarly life.\nDobzhansky was born on January 25, 1900, in Nemirov, Russian Empire (now Nemyriv, Ukraine), the only child of Grigory Dobzhansky, a mathematics teacher, and Sophia Voinarsky. He was given an unusual name, Theodosius, because he was born after his middle-aged parents prayed for a child to St. . In 1910 the family moved to Kiev.\nAt high school, Dobzhansky collected butterflies and decided to become a biologist. In 1915, he met Victor Luchnik who convinced him to specialize in beetles instead. Dobzhansky attended the University of Kiev, where he then studied until 1924 specializing in entomology. He then moved to Leningrad (today St. Petersburg) to study under Yuri Filipchenko, where a \"Drosophila melanogaster\" laboratory had been established.\nOn August 8, 1924, Dobzhansky married geneticist Natalia \"Natasha\" Sivertzeva, who was working with Ivan Schmalhausen in Kiev. The Dobzhanskys had one daughter, known under her married name as Sophie Coe, an anthropologist, food historian, and author, primarily known for her work on the history of chocolate.\nBefore immigrating to the United States, Dobzhansky published 35 scientific works on entomology and genetics.\nAmerica.\nDobzhansky immigrated to the United States in 1927 on a work\u2013study scholarship from the International Education Board of the Rockefeller Foundation. Upon arriving in New York City on December 27, he joined the \"Drosophila\" Group at Columbia University working alongside Thomas Hunt Morgan and Alfred Sturtevant.\u00a0Their work provided crucial information on Drosophila cytogenetics. Additionally, Dobzhansky and his team helped establish \"Drosophila pseudoobscura\", within the genus \"Drosophila\", as a favorable model organism in evolutionary-biological studies ever since they published their influential works. Dobzhansky's original mindset (after studying alongside Yuri Filipchenko), was that there were serious doubts on using data obtained from phenomena happening in local populations (microevolution) and phenomena happening on a global scale (macroevolution).\u00a0Filipchenko also believed that there were only two types of inheritance: Mendelian inheritance of variation within species, and Non-Mendelian inheritance of variation in a macroevolutionary sense.\u00a0Dobzhansky later stated that Filipchenko \"bet on the wrong horse\".\nHe followed Morgan to the California Institute of Technology from 1930 to 1940. On the basis of his experiments, he articulated the idea that reproductive isolation can be caused by differences in presence of microbial symbionts between populations. In 1937, he published one of the major works of the modern evolutionary synthesis, the synthesis of evolutionary biology with genetics, titled \"Genetics and the Origin of Species\", which amongst other things, defined evolution as \"a change in the frequency of an allele within a gene pool\". Dobzhansky's work was instrumental in spreading the idea that it is through mutations in genes that natural selection takes place. Also in 1937, he became a naturalized citizen of the United States. During this time, he had a very public falling out with one of his \"Drosophila\" collaborators, Alfred Sturtevant, based primarily in professional competition.\nHe returned to Columbia University from 1940 to 1962. Among his students was geneticist Bruce Wallace. In 1941, Dobzhansky was awarded the Daniel Giraud Elliot Medal from the National Academy of Sciences, of which he was also a member. He was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 1942. In 1943, the University of S\u00e3o Paulo awarded him an honorary doctorate. He was one of the signatories of the 1950 UNESCO statement \"The Race Question\". He was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1953. He then moved to the Rockefeller Institute (shortly to become Rockefeller University) until his retirement in 1971. In 1972 he was elected the founding president of the Behavior Genetics Association, and was recognized by the society for his role in behavior genetics, and the founding of the society by the creation of the Dobzhansky Award (for a lifetime of outstanding scholarship in behavior genetics).\nDobzhansky's work in the field of evolutionary genetics, with the help of Sewall Wright, integrated standards of the theoretical, natural historical, and experimental work.\nDobzhansky was elected a Foreign Member of the Royal Society (ForMemRS) in 1965. In 1970, he published \"Genetics of the evolutionary process\".\nDobzhansky was renowned as the president of the Genetics Society of America in 1941, president of the American Society of Naturalists in 1950, president of the Society for the Study of Evolution in 1951, president of the American Society of Zoologists in 1963, a member of the board of directors of the American Eugenics Society in 1964, and president of the American Teilhard de Chardin Association in 1969.\nDobzhansky's research and studies allowed him to travel the world and receive honorary degrees in Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Denmark, England, Germany, Italy, Japan, and Sweden.\n\"Genetics and the Origin of Species\".\nTheodosius Dobzhansky published three editions of his book \"Genetics and the Origin of Species\".\u00a0Although the book was meant for people with a background in biology, it was easily understood. In the fields of genetics and evolution, Dobzhansky's book is acknowledged as one of the most important books ever written. With each revision of \"Genetics and the Origin of Species\", Dobzhansky added new material on crucial, up-to-date topics, and removed material he deemed to be no longer crucial.\u00a0His book sparked trends in genetic research and theory.\nThe first edition of \"Genetics and the Origin of Species\" (1937) highlighted the most recent discoveries in genetics and how they applied to the concept of evolution. The book starts by addressing the problem of evolution and how modern discoveries in genetics could help find a solution.\u00a0The book covers the chromosomal basis of Mendelian Inheritance, how the effects from changes in chromosomes greater than gene mutations are common and acceptable, and how mutations form racial and specific differences. Dobzhansky explained how three levels could describe the processes of evolutionary population genetics: (1) the origin of raw materials by mutations of genes and chromosomes, (2) the changes in populations by changes in frequencies and combinations of mutations, (3) the fixation of changes by reproductive isolation. To support his writing and research, the bibliography was twenty-eight pages long with around six hundred sources.\nIn Dobzhansky's second edition of \"Genetics and the Origin of Species\" (1941), four years had gone by and he was able to add more research and advancements made in genetics.\u00a0Around half of the new research he found was added to the last two chapters in his book: Patterns of Evolution, and Species as Natural Units.\u00a0In the second to last chapter, Patterns of Evolution, Dobzhansky explained how on the path to a new adaptation, a method could be used to where a species could go through a less adaptive stage.\u00a0The last chapter, Species as Natural Units, Dobzhansky explained some of the contributions made in genetics to what was called \"the new systematics\".\u00a0Dobzhansky's second edition of the book also had twice as many sources in the bibliography than the first edition.\nIn the third revision of \"Genetics and the Origin of Species\" (1951), Dobzhansky rewrote all ten chapters on: Isolating Mechanisms, Mutation in Populations, Organic Diversity, Heredity and Mutation, Race Formation, Selection, Adaptive Polymorphism, Hybrid Sterility, Species as Natural Units, and Patterns of Evolution. Dobzhansky decided to remove the chapter on Polyploidy in the third edition. The new chapter on Adaptive Polymorphism highlighted Dobzhansky's research since the second edition. He included precise, quantitative evidence on effective natural selection in laboratory and free populations.\nDebate about race.\nTheodosius Dobzhansky and Ashley Montagu debated the use and validity of the term \"race\" over a period of many years without reaching an agreement. Montagu argued that \"race\" was so laden with toxic associations that it was a word best eliminated from science completely. Dobzhansky argued that science should not give in to the misuses to which it had been subjected, and that the concept of animal and plant races has been important in biology; the modern synthesis used the concept for describing the diverging biological populations differing in gene frequencies. This was done in hopes that its foundation in population genetics would undermine the deeply ingrained social prejudices associated with \"race\".\nHis concern with the interface between humans and biology may have come from different factors. The main factor would be the race prejudice that contributed in Europe that triggered WWII. His concern also dealt with religion in human life which he speaks about in his book \"The Biology of Ultimate Concern\" in 1967. \"The pervasiveness of genetic variation provides the biological foundation of human individuality\". Dobzhansky talks about in great detail that \"human nature has 2 dimensions: the biological, which mankind shares with the rest of life, and the cultural, which is exclusive to humans.\" Both of these are believed to have come from \"biological evolution and cultural evolution\".\nDobzhansky sought to put an end to the pseudoscience that purports genetic makeup to determine race, and thus rank in society. Harrison E. Salisbury wrote in a New York Times review of Dobzhansky's book \"Heredity and the Future of Man\" that Dobzhansky could not, together with other scientists, agree upon what defines a race. Dobzhansky stated that a true bloodline for man could not be identified. He did not believe that a person's genetic makeup decided whether or not he would be a great man but rather that man \"has the rare opportunity 'to direct his evolution'\".\nFinal illness and the \"Light of Evolution\".\nDobzhansky's wife Natasha died of coronary thrombosis on February 22, 1969. Earlier (on June 1, 1968), Theodosius had been diagnosed with lymphocytic leukemia (a chronic form of leukemia), and had been given a few months to a few years to live. He retired in 1971, moving to the University of California, Davis where his student Francisco J. Ayala had been made assistant professor, and where he continued working as an emeritus professor. He published one of his most famous essays \"Nothing in Biology Makes Sense Except in the Light of Evolution\" in 1973, influenced by the paleontologist and priest Pierre Teilhard de Chardin.\nBy 1975, his leukemia had become more severe, and on November 11 he traveled to San Jacinto, California, for treatment and care. Working until his last day as a professor of genetics, Dobzhansky died (from heart failure) on December 18, 1975, in Davis, California. He was cremated, and his ashes were scattered in the Californian wilderness.\nEvolution and God.\nTheodosius Dobzhansky believed that God and science can be reconciled through the idea that the Creator brought about his plan through the processes of evolution. He described his beliefs as \"Evolution is God's, or Nature's, method of Creation.\"\nPublications.\nDuring his career, Dobzhansky published widely in books and peer-reviewed scientific journals:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

In the South West of England, the term is commonly also used for the hills themselves \u2013 particularly the high points of Dartmoor in Devon and Bodmin Moor in Cornwall.\nEtymology.\nAlthough English topographical names often have a Celtic etymology, the \"Oxford English Dictionary\" lists no cognates to the Old English word in either the Breton or Cornish languages (the Scottish Gaelic is thought to derive from the Old English word). It is therefore accepted that the English word \"Tor\" derives from the Old Welsh word or , meaning a cluster or heap.\nFormation.\nTors are landforms created by the erosion and weathering of rock; most commonly granites, but also schists, dacites, dolerites, ignimbrites, coarse sandstones and others. Tors are mostly less than high. Many hypotheses have been proposed to explain their origin and this remains a topic of discussion among geologists and geomorphologists, and physical geographers. It is considered likely that tors were created by geomorphic processes that differed widely in type and duration according to regional and local differences in climate and rock types.\nFor example, the Dartmoor granite was emplaced around 280 million years ago. When the cover rocks eroded away it was exposed to chemical and physical weathering processes. Where joints are closely spaced, the large crystals in the granite readily disintegrate to form a sandy regolith known locally as \"growan\". This is readily stripped off by solifluction or surface wash when not protected by vegetation, notably during prolonged cold phases during the Quaternary ice ages \u2013 periglaciation.\nWhere joints happen to be unusually widely spaced, core blocks can survive and remain above the weathering surface, developing into tors. These can be monolithic, as at Haytor and Blackingstone Rock, but are more usually subdivided into stacks, often arranged in avenues. Each stack may include several tiers or \"pillows\", which may become separated: rocking pillows are called logan stones. These stacks are vulnerable to frost action and often collapse leaving trails of blocks down the slopes called \"clitter\" or \"clatter\". Weathering has also given rise to circular \"rock basins\" formed by the accumulation of water and repeated freezing and thawing. An example is found at Kes Tor on Dartmoor.\nDating of 28 tors on Dartmoor showed that most are surprisingly young, less than 100,000 years of surface exposure, with none over 200,000 years old. They probably emerged at the start of the last major ice age (Devensian). By contrast the Scottish Cairngorms, which is the other classic granite tor concentration in Britain, the oldest tors dated are between 200 and 675 thousand years of exposure, with even glacially-modified ones having dates of 100\u2013150,000 years.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The six volumes cover, from 98 to 1590, the peak of the Roman Empire, the history of early Christianity and its emergence as the Roman state religion, the Fall of the Western Roman Empire, the rise of Genghis Khan and Tamerlane and the fall of Byzantium, as well as discussions on the ruins of Ancient Rome.\nVolume I was first published in February 1776 by William Strahan and Thomas Cadell. It was reissued in a succession of six revised editions between 1776 and 1789. Volumes II and III appeared in 1781, and the final three volumes (IV\u2013VI) were issued together in 1788. All six volumes of the first edition were published in quarto; later octavo reprints followed from 1783 onward.\nConception and writing.\nGibbon's initial plan was to write a history \"of the decline and fall of the city of Rome\", and only later expanded his scope to the whole Roman Empire.\nAlthough he published other books, Gibbon devoted much of his life to this one work. His 1796 autobiography \"Memoirs of My Life and Writings\" is devoted largely to his reflections on how the book virtually \"became\" his life. He compared the publication of each succeeding volume to a newborn child.\nAs for sources more recent than the ancients, Gibbon drew on Montesquieu's \"Considerations on the Causes of the Greatness of the Romans and their Decline\" (1734), Voltaire's \"Essay on Universal History\" (1756), and Bossuet's \"Discourse on Universal History\" (1681).\nThesis.\nGibbon offers an explanation for the fall of the Roman Empire, a task made difficult by a lack of comprehensive written sources.\nAccording to Gibbon, the Roman Empire succumbed to barbarian invasions in large part due to the gradual loss of civic virtue among its citizens. He began an ongoing controversy about the role of Christianity, but he gave great weight to other causes of internal decline and to attacks from outside the Empire.\nLike other Enlightenment thinkers and British citizens of the age steeped in institutional anti-Catholicism, Gibbon held in contempt the Middle Ages as a priest-ridden, superstitious Dark Age. It was not until his own era, the \"Age of Reason\", with its emphasis on rational thought, he believed, that human history could resume its progress.\nStyle.\nGibbon's tone was detached, dispassionate, and yet critical. He was noted as occasionally lapsing into moralisation and aphorism.\nEditions.\nGibbon continued to revise and change his work even after publication. The complexities of the problem are addressed in Womersley's introduction and appendices to his complete edition.\nCriticism.\nNumerous tracts were published criticising his work. In response, Gibbon defended his work with the 1779 publication of \"A Vindication ... of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire\". \nGibbon's central thesis in his explanation of how the Roman Empire fell, that it was due to embracing Christianity, is not widely accepted by scholars today. Gibbon argued that with the empire's new Christian character, large sums of wealth that would have otherwise been used in secular affairs in promoting the state were transferred to promoting the activities of the Church. However, the pre-Christian empire also spent large financial sums on religion and it is unclear whether or not the change of religion increased the amount of resources the empire spent on it. Gibbon further argued that new attitudes in Christianity caused many Christians of wealth to renounce their lifestyles and enter a monastic lifestyle, and so stop participating in the support of the empire. However, while many Christians of wealth did become monastics, this paled in comparison to the participants in the imperial bureaucracy. Although Gibbon further pointed out that the importance Christianity placed on peace caused a decline in the number of people serving the military, the decline was so small as to be negligible for the army's overall effectiveness.\nJohn Julius Norwich, despite his admiration for Gibbon's furthering of historical methodology, considered his hostile views on the Byzantine Empire flawed, and blamed him somewhat for the lack of interest shown in the subject throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries. Gibbon prefaced subsequent editions to note that discussion of Byzantium was not his interest in writing the book. However, the Yugoslavian historian George Ostrogorsky wrote, \"Gibbon and Lebeau were genuine historians\u00a0\u2013 and Gibbon a very great one\u00a0\u2013 and their works, in spite of factual inadequacy, rank high for their presentation of their material.\"\nGibbon challenged Church history by estimating far smaller numbers of Christian martyrs than had been traditionally accepted. The Church's version of its early history had rarely been questioned before. Gibbon, however, said that modern Church writings were secondary sources, and he shunned them in favour of primary sources.\nHistorian S. P. Foster says that Gibbon \"blamed the otherworldly preoccupations of Christianity for the decline of the Roman empire, heaped scorn and abuse on the church, and sneered at the entirety of monasticism as a dreary, superstition-ridden enterprise\".\nGibbon's work was originally published in sections, as was common for large works at the time. The first two volumes were well-received and widely praised, but with the publication of volume 3, Gibbon was attacked by some as a \"paganist\" because he argued that Christianity (or at least the abuse of it by some of the clergy and its followers) had hastened the fall of the Roman Empire.\nVoltaire was deemed to have influenced Gibbon's claim that Christianity was a contributor to the fall of the Roman Empire.\nGibbon has been criticized for his portrayal of Paganism as tolerant and Christianity as intolerant.\nLegacy.\nMany writers have used variations on the series title (including using \"Rise and Fall\" in place of \"Decline and Fall\"), especially when dealing with a large polity that has imperial characteristics. Notable examples include Jefferson Davis' \"The Rise and Fall of the Confederate Government\", William Shirer's \"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich\", and David Bowie's \"The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars\". \nThe title and author have also been referenced in poems such as No\u00ebl Coward's \"I Went to a Marvellous Party\" (\"If you have any mind at all, / Gibbon's divine \"Decline and Fall\", / Seems pretty flimsy, / No more than a whimsy...\") and Isaac Asimov's \"The Foundation of S.F. Success\", in which Asimov admits his \"Foundation\" series (about the fall and rebuilding of a galactic empire) was written \"with a tiny bit of cribbin' / from the works of Edward Gibbon\".\nPiers Brendon, who wrote \"The Decline and Fall of the British Empire, 1781\u20131997\", claimed that Gibbon's work \"became the essential guide for Britons anxious to plot their own imperial trajectory. They found the key to understanding the British Empire in the ruins of Rome.\"\nIn 1995, an established journal of classical scholarship, \"Classics Ireland\", published punk musician Iggy Pop's reflections on the applicability of \"The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire\" to the modern world in a short article, \"Caesar Lives\", (vol.\u00a02, 1995) in which he asserted:America is Rome. Of course, why shouldn't it be? We are all Roman children, for better or worse ... I learn much about the way our society really works, because the system-origins \u2013 military, religious, political, colonial, agricultural, financial \u2013 are all there to be scrutinised in their infancy.

The works are based loosely on characters from Germanic heroic legend, namely Norse legendary sagas and the . The composer termed the cycle a \"\" (stage festival play), structured in three days preceded by a (\"preliminary evening\"). It is often referred to as the Ring\" cycle, Wagner's \"Ring, or simply The Ring\"\"'.\nWagner wrote the libretto and music over the course of about twenty-six years, from 1848 to 1874. The four parts that constitute the \"Ring\" cycle are, in sequence:\nIndividual works of the sequence are often performed separately, and indeed the operas contain dialogues that mention events in the previous operas, so that a viewer could watch any of them without having watched the previous parts and still understand the plot. However, Wagner intended them to be performed in series. The first performance as a cycle opened the first Bayreuth Festival in 1876, beginning with \"Das Rheingold\" on 13 August and ending with \"G\u00f6tterd\u00e4mmerung\" on 17 August. Opera stage director Anthony Freud stated that \"marks the high-water mark of our art form, the most massive challenge any opera company can undertake.\"\nTitle.\nWagner's title is most literally rendered in English as \"The Ring of the Nibelung\". The Nibelung of the title is the dwarf Alberich, and the ring in question is the one he fashions from the Rhinegold. The title therefore denotes \"Alberich's Ring\".\nContent.\nThe cycle is a work of extraordinary scale. A full performance of the cycle takes place over four nights at the opera, with a total playing time of about 15 hours, depending on the conductor's pacing. The first and shortest work, \"Das Rheingold\", has no interval and is one continuous piece of music typically lasting around two and a half hours, while the final and longest, \"G\u00f6tterd\u00e4mmerung\", takes up to five hours, excluding intervals. The cycle is modelled after ancient Greek dramas that were presented as three tragedies and one satyr play. The \"Ring\" proper begins with \"Die Walk\u00fcre\" and ends with \"G\u00f6tterd\u00e4mmerung\", with \"Rheingold\" as a prelude. Wagner called \"Das Rheingold\" a \"Vorabend\" or \"Preliminary Evening\", and \"Die Walk\u00fcre\", \"Siegfried\" and \"G\u00f6tterd\u00e4mmerung\" were subtitled First Day, Second Day and Third Day, respectively, of the trilogy proper.\nThe scale and scope of the story is epic. It follows the struggles of gods, heroes, and several mythical creatures over the eponymous magic ring that grants domination over the entire world. The drama and intrigue continue through three generations of protagonists, until the final cataclysm at the end of \"G\u00f6tterd\u00e4mmerung\".\nThe music of the cycle is thick and richly textured, and grows in complexity as the cycle proceeds. Wagner wrote for an orchestra of gargantuan proportions, including a greatly enlarged brass section with instruments such as the Wagner tuba, bass trumpet and contrabass trombone. Remarkably, he uses a chorus only relatively briefly, in acts 2 and 3 of \"G\u00f6tterd\u00e4mmerung\", and then mostly of men with just a few women. He eventually had a purpose-built theatre constructed, the Bayreuth Festspielhaus, in which to perform this work. The theatre has a special stage that blends the huge orchestra with the singers' voices, allowing them to sing at a natural volume. The result was that the singers did not have to strain themselves vocally during the long performances.\nStory.\nThe plot revolves around a magic ring that grants the power to rule the world, forged by the Nibelung dwarf Alberich from gold he stole from the Rhine maidens in the river Rhine. With the assistance of the god Loge, Wotan \u2013 the chief of the gods \u2013 steals the ring from Alberich, but is forced to hand it over to the giants Fafner and Fasolt in payment for building the home of the gods, Valhalla, or they will take Freia, who provides the gods with the golden apples that keep them young. Wotan's schemes to regain the ring, spanning generations, drive much of the action in the story. His grandson, the mortal Siegfried, wins the ring by slaying Fafner (who slew Fasolt for the ring) \u2013 as Wotan intended \u2013 but is eventually betrayed and slain as a result of the intrigues of Alberich's son Hagen, who wants the ring for himself. Finally, the Valkyrie Br\u00fcnnhilde \u2013 Siegfried's lover and Wotan's daughter who lost her immortality for defying her father in an attempt to save Siegfried's father Sigmund \u2013 returns the ring to the Rhine maidens as she commits suicide on Siegfried's funeral pyre. Hagen is drowned as he attempts to recover the ring. In the process, the gods and Valhalla are destroyed.\nWagner created the story of the \"Ring\" by fusing elements from many German and Scandinavian myths and folk-tales. The Old Norse \"Edda\" supplied much of the material for \"Das Rheingold\", while \"Die Walk\u00fcre\" was largely based on the \"V\u00f6lsunga saga\". \"Siegfried\" contains elements from the Eddur, the \"V\u00f6lsunga saga\" and \"Thidrekssaga\". The final \"G\u00f6tterd\u00e4mmerung\" draws from the 12th-century German poem, the \"Nibelungenlied\", which appears to have been the original inspiration for the \"Ring\".\n\"The Ring\" has been the subject of myriad interpretations. For example, George Bernard Shaw, in \"The Perfect Wagnerite\", argues for a view of \"The Ring\" as an essentially socialist critique of industrial society and its abuses. Robert Donington in \"Wagner's Ring And Its Symbols\" interprets it in terms of Jungian psychology, as an account of the development of unconscious archetypes in the mind, leading towards individuation.\nConcept.\nIn his earlier operas (up to and including \"Lohengrin\") Wagner's style had been based, rather than on the Italian style of opera, on the German style as developed by Carl Maria von Weber, with elements of the grand opera style of Giacomo Meyerbeer. However he came to be dissatisfied with such a format as a means of artistic expression. He expressed this clearly in his essay \"A Communication to My Friends\" (1851), in which he condemned the majority of modern artists, in painting and in music, as \"feminine ... the world of art close fenced from Life, in which Art plays with herself.' Where however the impressions of Life produce an overwhelming 'poetic force', we find the 'masculine, the generative path of Art'.\nWagner unfortunately found that his audiences were not willing to follow where he led them:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The public, by their enthusiastic reception of \"Rienzi\" and their cooler welcome of the \"Flying Dutchman\", had plainly shown me what I must set before them if I sought to please. I completely undeceived their expectations; they left the theatre, after the first performance of \"Tannh\u00e4user\", [1845] in a confused and discontented mood. \u2013 The feeling of utter loneliness in which I now found myself, quite unmanned me... My \"Tannh\u00e4user\" had appealed to a handful of intimate friends alone.\nFinally Wagner announces:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;I shall never write an \"Opera\" more. As I have no wish to invent an arbitrary title for my works, I will call them Dramas ...\nI propose to produce my myth in three complete dramas, preceded by a lengthy Prelude (Vorspiel). ...\nAt a specially-appointed Festival, I propose, some future time, to produce those three Dramas with their Prelude, \"in the course of three days and a fore-evening\". The object of this production I shall consider thoroughly attained, if I and my artistic comrades, the actual performers, shall within these four evenings succeed in \"artistically conveying my purpose to the true Emotional\" (not the Critical) \"Understanding\" of spectators who shall have gathered together expressly to learn it.\nThis is his first public announcement of the form of what would become the \"Ring\" cycle.\nIn accordance with the ideas expressed in his essays of the period 1849\u201351 (including the \"Communication\" but also \"Opera and Drama\" and \"The Artwork of the Future\"), the four parts of the \"Ring\" were originally conceived by Wagner to be free of the traditional operatic concepts of aria and operatic chorus. The Wagner scholar Curt von Westernhagen identified three important problems discussed in \"Opera and Drama\" which were particularly relevant to the \"Ring\" cycle: the problem of unifying verse stress with melody; the disjunctions caused by formal arias in dramatic structure and the way in which opera music could be organised on a different basis of organic growth and modulation; and the function of musical motifs in linking elements of the plot whose connections might otherwise be inexplicit. This became known as the leitmotif technique (see below), although Wagner himself did not use this word.\nHowever, Wagner relaxed some aspects of his self-imposed restrictions somewhat as the work progressed. As George Bernard Shaw sardonically (and slightly unfairly) noted of the last opera \"G\u00f6tterd\u00e4mmerung\":\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;And now, O Nibelungen Spectator, pluck up; for all allegories come to an end somewhere... The rest of what you are going to see is opera and nothing but opera. Before many bars have been played, Siegfried and the wakened Brynhild, newly become tenor and soprano, will sing a concerted cadenza; plunge on from that to a magnificent love duet...The work which follows, entitled \"Night Falls on the Gods\" [Shaw's translation of \"G\u00f6tterd\u00e4mmerung\"], is a thorough grand opera.\nMusic.\nLeitmotifs.\nAs a significant element in the \"Ring\" and his subsequent works, Wagner adopted the use of leitmotifs, which are recurring themes or harmonic progressions. They musically denote an action, object, emotion, character, or other subject mentioned in the text or presented onstage. Wagner referred to them in \"Opera and Drama\" as \"guides-to-feeling\", describing how they could be used to inform the listener of a musical or dramatic subtext to the action onstage in the same way as a Greek chorus did for the theatre of ancient Greece.\nInstrumentation.\nWagner made significant innovations in orchestration in this work. He wrote for a very large orchestra, using the whole range of instruments used singly or in combination to express the great range of emotion and events of the drama. Wagner even commissioned the production of new instruments, including the Wagner tuba, invented to fill a gap he found between the tone qualities of the horn and the trombone, as well as variations of existing instruments, such as the bass trumpet and a contrabass trombone with a double slide. He also developed the \"Wagner bell\", enabling the bassoon to reach the low A-natural, whereas normally B-flat is the instrument's lowest note. If such a bell is not to be used, then a contrabassoon should be employed.\nAll four parts have a very similar instrumentation. The core ensemble of instruments are one piccolo, three flutes (third doubling second piccolo), three oboes, cor anglais (doubling fourth oboe), three soprano clarinets, one bass clarinet, three bassoons; eight horns (fifth through eighth doubling Wagner tubas), three trumpets, one bass trumpet, three tenor trombones, one contrabass trombone (doubling bass trombone), one contrabass tuba; a percussion section with 4 timpani (requiring two players), triangle, cymbals, tam-tam; six harps and a string section consisting of 16 first and 16 second violins, 12 violas, 12 cellos and 8 double basses.\n\"Das Rheingold\" requires one bass drum, one onstage harp and 18 onstage anvils. \"Die Walk\u00fcre\" requires one snare drum, one D clarinet (played by the third clarinettist) and an on-stage steerhorn. \"Siegfried\" requires one onstage cor anglais and one onstage horn. \"G\u00f6tterd\u00e4mmerung\" requires a tenor drum, as well as five onstage horns and four onstage steerhorns, one of them to be blown by Hagen.\nTonality.\nMuch of the \"Ring\", especially from \"Siegfried\" act 3 onwards, cannot be said to be in traditional, clearly defined keys for long stretches, but rather in 'key regions', each of which flows smoothly into the following. This fluidity avoided the musical equivalent of clearly defined musical paragraphs and assisted Wagner in building the work's huge structures. Tonal indeterminacy was heightened by the increased freedom with which he used dissonance and chromaticism. Chromatically altered chords are used very liberally in the \"Ring\" and this feature, which is also prominent in \"Tristan und Isolde\", is often cited as a milestone on the way to Arnold Schoenberg's revolutionary break with the traditional concept of key and his dissolution of consonance as the basis of an organising principle in music.\nComposition.\nIn summer 1848 Wagner wrote \"The Nibelung Myth as Sketch for a Drama\", combining the medieval sources previously mentioned into a single narrative, very similar to the plot of the eventual \"Ring\" cycle, but nevertheless with substantial differences. Later that year he began writing a libretto entitled \"Siegfrieds Tod\" (\"Siegfried's Death\"). He was possibly stimulated by a series of articles in the \"Neue Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Musik\", inviting composers to write a 'national opera' based on the \"Nibelungenlied\", a 12th-century High German poem which, since its rediscovery in 1755, had been hailed by the German Romantics as the \"German national epic\". \"Siegfrieds Tod\" dealt with the death of Siegfried, the central heroic figure of the Nibelungenlied. The idea had occurred to others \u2013 the correspondence of Fanny and Felix Mendelssohn in 1840/41 reveals that they were both outlining scenarios on the subject: Fanny wrote 'The hunt with Siegfried's death provides a splendid finale to the second act'.\nBy 1850, Wagner had completed a musical sketch (which he abandoned) for \"Siegfrieds Tod\". He now felt that he needed a preliminary opera, \"Der junge Siegfried\" (\"The Young Siegfried\", later renamed to \"Siegfried\"), to explain the events in \"Siegfrieds Tod\" and his verse draft of this was completed in May 1851. By October, he had made the momentous decision to embark on a cycle of four operas, to be played over four nights: \"Das Rheingold\", \"Die Walk\u00fcre\", \"Der Junge Siegfried\" and \"Siegfrieds Tod\"; the text for all four parts was completed in December 1852 and privately published in February 1853.\nIn November 1853, Wagner began the composition draft of \"Das Rheingold\". Unlike the verses, which were written as it were in reverse order, the music would be composed in the same order as the narrative. Composition proceeded until 1857, when the final score up to the end of act 2 of \"Siegfried\" was completed. Wagner then laid the work aside for twelve years, during which he wrote \"Tristan und Isolde\" and \"Die Meistersinger von N\u00fcrnberg\".\nBy 1869, Wagner was living at Tribschen on Lake Lucerne, sponsored by King Ludwig II of Bavaria. He returned to \"Siegfried\" and, remarkably, was able to pick up where he left off. In October, he completed the final work in the cycle. He chose the title \"G\u00f6tterd\u00e4mmerung\" instead of \"Siegfrieds Tod\". In the completed work the gods are destroyed in accordance with the new pessimistic thrust of the cycle, not redeemed as in the more optimistic originally planned ending. Wagner also decided to show onstage the events of \"Das Rheingold\" and \"Die Walk\u00fcre\", which had hitherto only been presented as back-narration in the other two parts. These changes resulted in some discrepancies in the cycle, but these do not diminish the value of the work.\nPerformances.\nFirst productions.\nOn King Ludwig's insistence, and over Wagner's objections, \"special previews\" of \"Das Rheingold\" and \"Die Walk\u00fcre\" were given at the National Theatre in Munich, before the rest of the \"Ring\". Thus, \"Das Rheingold\" premiered on 22 September 1869 and \"Die Walk\u00fcre\" on 26 June 1870. Wagner subsequently delayed announcing his completion of \"Siegfried\" to prevent this work also being premiered against his wishes.\nWagner had long desired to have a special festival opera house, designed by himself, for the performance of the \"Ring\". In 1871, he decided on a location in the Bavarian town of Bayreuth. In 1872, he moved to Bayreuth and the foundation stone was laid. Wagner would spend the next two years attempting to raise capital for the construction, with scant success; King Ludwig finally rescued the project in 1874 by donating the needed funds. The Bayreuth Festspielhaus opened in 1876 with the first complete performance of the \"Ring\", which took place from 13 to 17 August.\nIn 1882, London impresario Alfred Schulz-Curtius organized the first staging in the United Kingdom of the \"Ring\" cycle, conducted by Anton Seidl and directed by Angelo Neumann.\nThe first production of the \"Ring\" in Italy was in Venice (the place where Wagner died), just two months after his 1883 death, at La Fenice.\nThe first Australian \"Ring\" (and \"The Mastersingers of Nuremberg\") was presented in an English-language production by the British travelling Quinlan Opera Company, in conjunction with J. C. Williamson's, in Melbourne and Sydney in 1913.\nModern productions.\nThe \"Ring\" is a major undertaking for any opera company: staging four interlinked operas requires a huge commitment both artistically and financially; hence, in most opera houses, production of a new \"Ring\" cycle will happen over a number of years, with one or two operas in the cycle being added each year. The Bayreuth Festival, where the complete cycle is performed most years, is unusual in that a new cycle is almost always created within a single year.\nEarly productions of the \"Ring\" cycle stayed close to Wagner's original Bayreuth staging. Trends set at Bayreuth have continued to be influential. Following the closure of the Festspielhaus during the Second World War, the 1950s saw productions by Wagner's grandsons Wieland and Wolfgang Wagner (known as the \"New Bayreuth\" style), which emphasised the human aspects of the drama in a more abstract setting.\nPerhaps the most famous modern production was the centennial production of 1976, the \"Jahrhundertring\", directed by Patrice Ch\u00e9reau and conducted by Pierre Boulez. Set in the Industrial Revolution, it replaced the depths of the Rhine with a hydroelectric power dam and featured grimy sets populated by men and gods in 19th and 20th century business suits. This drew heavily on the reading of the \"Ring\" as a revolutionary drama and critique of the modern world, famously expounded by George Bernard Shaw in \"The Perfect Wagnerite\". Early performances were booed but the audience of 1980 gave it a 45-minute ovation in its final year.\nSeattle Opera has created three different productions of the tetralogy: \"Ring 1\", 1975 to 1984: Originally directed by George London, with designs by John Naccarato following the famous illustrations by Arthur Rackham. It was performed twice each summer, once in German, once in Andrew Porter's English adaptation. Henry Holt conducted all performances. \"Ring 2\", 1985\u20131995: Directed by Francois Rochaix, with sets and costumes designed by Robert Israel, lighting by Joan Sullivan and supertitles (the first ever created for the \"Ring\") by Sonya Friedman. The production set the action in a world of nineteenth-century theatricality; it was initially controversial in 1985, it sold out its final performances in 1995. Conductors included Armin Jordan (\"Die Walk\u00fcre\" in 1985), Manuel Rosenthal (1986) and Hermann Michael (1987, 1991 and 1995). \"Ring 3\", 2000\u20132013: the production, which became known as the \"Green\" \"Ring\", was in part inspired by the natural beauty of the Pacific Northwest. Directed by Stephen Wadsworth, set designer Thomas Lynch, costume designer Martin Pakledinaz, lighting designer Peter Kaczorowski; Armin Jordan conducted in 2000, Franz Vote in 2001 and Robert Spano in 2005 and 2009. The 2013 performances, conducted by Asher Fisch, were released as a commercial recording on compact disc and on iTunes.\nIn 2003 the first production of the cycle in Russia in modern times was conducted by Valery Gergiev at the Mariinsky Opera, Saint Petersburg, designed by George Tsypin. The production drew parallels with Ossetian mythology.\nThe Royal Danish Opera performed a complete \"Ring\" cycle in May 2006 in its new waterfront home, the Copenhagen Opera House. This version of the \"Ring\" tells the story from the viewpoint of Br\u00fcnnhilde and has a distinct feminist angle. For example, in a key scene in \"Die Walk\u00fcre\", it is Sieglinde and not Siegmund who manages to pull the sword Nothung out of a tree. At the end of the cycle, Br\u00fcnnhilde does not die, but instead gives birth to Siegfried's child.\nIn September 2006, the Canadian Opera Company opened its' new opera house, The Four Seasons Centre with a production of the Ring. Three cycles were presented with a different director overseeing an opera.\nSan Francisco Opera and Washington National Opera began a co-production of a new cycle in 2006 directed by Francesca Zambello. The production uses imagery from various eras of American history and has a feminist and environmentalist viewpoint. Recent performances of this production took place at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington D.C. in April/May 2016, featuring Catherine Foster and Nina Stemme as Br\u00fcnnhilde, Daniel Brenna as Siegfried and Alan Held as Wotan.\nLos Angeles Opera presented its first \"Ring\" cycle in 2010 directed by Achim Freyer. Freyer staged an abstract production that was praised by many critics but criticized by some of its own stars. The production featured a raked stage, flying props, screen projections and special effects.\nThe Metropolitan Opera began a new \"Ring\" cycle directed by French-Canadian theater director Robert Lepage in 2010. Premiering with \"Das Rheingold\" on opening night of the 2010/2011 Season conducted by James Levine with Bryn Terfel as Wotan. This was followed by \"Die Walk\u00fcre\" in April 2011 starring Deborah Voigt. The 2011/12 season introduced \"Siegfried\" and \"G\u00f6tterd\u00e4mmerung\" with Voigt, Terfel and Jay Hunter Morris before the entire cycle was given in the Spring of 2012 conducted by Fabio Luisi (who stepped in for Levine due to health issues). Lepage's staging was dominated by a 90,000 pound (40 tonne) structure which consisted of 24 identical aluminium planks able to rotate independently on a horizontal axis across the stage, providing level, sloping, angled or moving surfaces facing the audience. Bubbles, falling stones and fire were projected on to these surfaces, linked by computer with the music and movement of the characters. The subsequent HD recordings in 2013 won the Met's orchestra and chorus the Grammy Award for Best Opera Recording for their performance. In 2019, the Metropolitan Opera revived the Lepage staging for the first time since 2013 with Philippe Jordan conducting, Greer Grimsley and Michael Volle rotating as Wotan, Stefan Vinke and Andreas Schager rotating as Siegfried and Met homegrown Christine Goerke as Br\u00fcnnhilde. Lepage's \"Machine\", as it affectionately became known, underwent major reconfiguration for the revival in order to dampen the creaking that it had produced in the past (to the annoyance of audience members and critics) and to improve its reliability, as it had been known to break down during earlier runs including on the opening night of \"Rheingold\". Unlike its beloved predecessor directed by Viennese opera director Otto Schenk which played at the house over 22 years, the Met has confirmed that this controversial and expensive production will not return again, having lasted just shy of ten years at the house with only three complete cycles having been given. They announced it would be replaced by a new production in 2025, however though originally in partnership with the English National Opera this was cancelled due to ENO budgetary cuts and poor audience response. In 2024 they announced director Yuval Sharon would instead direct a new production with the first installment set to premiere in the 27/28 season finishing with the full cycle in the Spring of 2030.\nThe Lyric Opera of Chicago has staged three complete Ring Cycles in the past four decades, with a cycle in the 1990s, the 2000s, and in the late 2010s.\nThe mid-1990s production by August Everding with choreography by Cirque du Soleil's Debra Brown was conducted by Zubin Mehta, with James Morris a Wotan and Eva Marton as Br\u00fcnnhilde, Siegfried Jerusalem as Siegmund, and Tina Kiberg as Sieglinde.\nThe 2000s Ring cast included \"James Morris as Wotan, Jane Eaglen as Br\u00fcnnhilde, Pl\u00e1cido Domingo as Siegmund, and Michelle DeYoung as Sieglinde.\" Lyric music director Andrew Davis conduct[ed]. The company ... revived the August Everding production that it presented nine years [earlier], restaged by Herbert Kellner with minor changes ... The bungee-jumping Rhinemaidens and the Valkyries on trampolines from the original production, choreographed by Cirque du Soleil's Debra Brown ... returned. Sets and costumes [were] by John Conklin; lighting [was] by Duane Schuler.\"\nThe most recent production's Das Rheingold premiered in 2016, with subsequent Ring operas Die Walk\u00fcre, Siegfried, and G\u00f6tterd\u00e4mmerung staged between 2017 and 2019. The subsequent \"full Ring\" performances in the spring of 2020 were cancelled due to the COVID-19 global pandemic and has never been staged at the Lyric as the complete cycle. \nOpera Australia presented the \"Ring\" cycle at the State Theatre in Melbourne, Australia, in November 2013, directed by Neil Armfield and conducted by Pietari Inkinen. \"Classical Voice America\" heralded the production as \"one of the best Rings anywhere in a long time.\" The production was presented again in Melbourne from 21 November to 16 December 2016 starring Lise Lindstrom, Stefan Vinke, Amber Wagner and Jacqueline Dark.\nIt is possible to perform \"The Ring\" with fewer resources than usual. In 1990, the City of Birmingham Touring Opera (now Birmingham Opera Company), presented a two-evening adaptation (by Jonathan Dove) for a limited number of solo singers, each doubling several roles and 18 orchestral players. This version was subsequently given productions in the USA. A heavily cut-down version (7 hours plus intervals) was performed at the Teatro Col\u00f3n in Buenos Aires on 26 November 2012 to mark the 200th anniversary of Wagner's birth.\nIn a different approach, \"Der Ring in Minden\" staged the cycle on the small stage of the Stadttheater Minden, beginning in 2015 with \"Das Rheingold\", followed by the other parts in the succeeding years and culminating with the complete cycle performed twice in 2019. The stage director was Gerd Heinz, and Frank Beermann conducted the Nordwestdeutsche Philharmonie, playing at the back of the stage. The singers acted in front of the orchestra, making an intimate approach to the dramatic situations possible. The project received international recognition.\nOther treatments of the \"Ring\" cycle.\nOrchestral versions of the \"Ring\" cycle, summarizing the work in a single movement of an hour or so, have been made by Leopold Stokowski, Lorin Maazel (\"Der Ring ohne Worte\") (1988) and Henk de Vlieger (\"The Ring: An Orchestral Adventure\"), (1991).\nEnglish-Canadian comedian and singer Anna Russell recorded a twenty-two-minute version of the \"Ring\" for her album \"Anna Russell Sings! Again?\" in 1953, characterized by camp humour and sharp wit.\nProduced by the Ridiculous Theatrical Company, Charles Ludlam's 1977 play \"Der Ring Gott Farblonjet\" was a spoof of Wagner's operas. The show received a well-reviewed 1990 revival in New York at the Lucille Lortel Theatre.\nIn 1991, Seattle Opera premiered a musical comedy parody of the Ring Cycle called Das Barbec\u00fc, with book and lyrics by Jim Luigs and music by Scott Warrender. It follows the outline of the cycle's plot but shifts the setting to Texas ranch country. It was later produced off-broadway and elsewhere around the world.\nThe German two-part television movie \"\" (2004, also known as \"Ring of the Nibelungs\", \"Die Nibelungen\", \"Curse of the Ring\" and \"Sword of Xanten\"), is based in some of the same material Richard Wagner used for his music dramas \"Siegfried\" and \"G\u00f6tterd\u00e4mmerung\".\nAn adaptation of Wagner's storyline was published as a graphic novel in 2002 by P. Craig Russell.\nThe \"Ring\" cycle was the basis for a video game duology simply titled \"Ring\", where each game adapts two of the four parts. The game reimagines the \"Ring\" cycle in a science fiction setting, and was very poorly received critically; although the first game was a financial success.\nFootnotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Both were created by college professors John G. Kemeny and Thomas E. Kurtz.\nHistory.\nTrue BASIC traces its history to an offshoot of Dartmouth BASIC called Structured BASIC, or SBASIC for short. This was released sometime in 1975 or 1976, but was not installed as the mainline version of BASIC on the Dartmouth Time-Sharing System (DTSS) that supported the campus. Shortly after, Kemeny became involved in an effort to produce an ANSI standard BASIC in an attempt to bring together the many small variations of the language that had developed through the late 1960s and early 1970s. This effort initially focused on a system known as Minimal BASIC that was similar to earliest versions of Dartmouth BASIC, while later work was aimed at a Full BASIC that was essentially SBASIC with various extensions.\nBy the early 1980s, tens of millions of home computers were running some variation of Microsoft BASIC, which had become the \"de facto\" standard. The ANSI efforts eventually became pointless, as it became clear that these versions were not going to have any market impact in a world dominated by Microsoft. Both versions were eventually ratified but saw little or no adoption and the standards were later withdrawn. Kemeny and Kurtz, however, decided to continue their efforts to introduce the concepts from SBASIC and the ANSI Standard BASIC efforts. This became True BASIC.\nInitially based on Dartmouth BASIC 7, True BASIC was introduced in 1985. There are versions of the True BASIC compiler for MS-DOS, Microsoft Windows, and Classic Mac OS. At one time, versions for TRS-80 Color Computer, Amiga and Atari ST computers were offered, as well as a UNIX command-line compiler.\nFeatures.\nBeing a structured programming implementation of the language, it dispenses with the need for line numbers and codice_1 statements, although these can still be used.\nTrue BASIC provides statements for matrix arithmetic, a feature that had been present in Dartmouth BASIC since early times, but had been dropped in almost all microcomputer versions of BASIC interpreters. It implements global and local variables which make it possible to write recursive functions and subroutines.\nThe designers wanted to make the language hardware-independent, so True BASIC source code would run equally well on any version of their compiler. For the most part, they succeed in this endeavor. The drawback for users was that direct access to some features of their machines was not available, but this could be remedied with callable functions and subroutines specially written in assembly language.\nUsing newer versions of True BASIC, some of the older functions are blocked out. An example of the recent code would be more like this:\nRANDOMIZE\nSET WINDOW 0,20,0,20\nSET COLOR 5 !Set the pen and text colour to 5 as true basic has 0-15 colours\nPRINT \"Welcome To ...\" !Print \"Welcome To ...\" on the user's screen.\nDO !Begin the loop\n LET x=rnd*20 !Let the value 'x' equal a random number between '0' and '20'\n LET y=rnd*20 !Let the value 'y' equal a random number between '0' and '20'\n Pause .1 !Waits 1/10 of a second\n PLOT TEXT, at x, y: \"Fabulous Wikipedia!\" !Plot 'Fabulous Wikipedia!' at coordinates 'x' and 'y'\nLOOP !End the loop\nEND !End the program\nThis simple program plots the text \"Welcome To ...\" at the top left-hand corner of the screen, and then continues into a never-ending loop plotting \"Fabulous Wikipedia!\" at random coordinates.\nAn example of simple animation could be like this:\n!Draw the Car\nSET WINDOW 0,20,0,20\nSET COLOR 5\nBOX AREA 2,6,2,3\nBOX AREA 9,13,2,3\nBOX AREA 16,20,2,3\nSET COLOR 249\nPLOT LINES :0,5;20,5\nFLOOD 10,1\nBOX KEEP 0,20,0,5 IN road$\nBOX CIRCLE 2,3,5,6\nFLOOD 2.5,5.5\nBOX CIRCLE 5,6,5,6\nFLOOD 5.5,5.5\nSET COLOR 35\nPLOT LINES :2.5,6;5.5,6\nPLOT LINES :5,6;8,6;8,8;6,8;6,10;2,10;2,8;0,8;0,6;3,6\nFLOOD 4,8\nSET COLOR 248\nBOX AREA 4,5,8,9\nBOX KEEP 0,8,5,10 IN car$ !Save the car in 'car$'\nFOR x=1 TO 20 STEP 1 !Create a 'for' loop\n BOX SHOW road$ AT 0,0\n BOX SHOW car$ AT x,5 \n PAUSE .1\n CLEAR\nNEXT x !End the 'for' loop\nEND !End the programs\nReception.\nJerry Pournelle in 1985 asked, \"why do we need True BASIC at all? [It] doesn't seem to do anything regular BASIC doesn't do, and what it does do isn't attacked in a logical or intuitive manner.\" He criticized the lack of output when encountering an error, preventing interactive debugging by \"inserting print statements as diagnostics\". Pournelle concluded, \"I think I'll pass up the opportunity to become a born-again True BASIC believer. I'll enjoy my Microsoft and CBASIC heresies.\"\nSome users have complained about their programs and the editor using up 100% of their CPU (or core). This appears to be caused by the editor and user's programs using a loop which constantly polls the keyboard and mouse for events. The problem has been known since at least the end of 2010, yet as of early 2014 is still being worked on.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Potential osmotic pressure is the maximum osmotic pressure that could develop in a solution if it was not separated from its pure solvent by a semipermeable membrane.\nOsmosis occurs when two solutions containing different concentrations of solute are separated by a selectively permeable membrane. Solvent molecules pass preferentially through the membrane from the low-concentration solution to the solution with higher solute concentration. The transfer of solvent molecules will continue until \"osmotic equilibrium\" is attained.\nTheory and measurement.\nJacobus van\u00a0't Hoff derived thermodynamically a quantitative relationship between osmotic pressure and solute concentration, expressed in the following equation, where formula_1 is the water activity:\nformula_2\nFor ideal solutions of low concentration, we can approximate this equation as\nformula_3\nwhere formula_4 is osmotic pressure, \"i\" is the dimensionless van\u00a0't Hoff index, \"c\" is the molar concentration of solute, \"R\" is the ideal gas constant, and \"T\" is the absolute temperature (usually in kelvins). This formula applies when the solute concentration is sufficiently low that the solution can be treated as an ideal solution. The proportionality to concentration means that osmotic pressure is a colligative property. Note the similarity of this formula to the ideal gas law in the form formula_5 where n is the total number of moles of gas molecules in the volume \"V\", and \"n\"/\"V\" is the molar concentration of gas molecules. Harmon Northrop Morse and Frazer showed that the equation applied to more concentrated solutions if the unit of concentration was molal rather than molar; so when the molality is used this equation has been called the Morse equation.\nFor more concentrated solutions the van\u00a0't Hoff equation can be extended as a power series in solute concentration, \"c\". To a first approximation,\nformula_6\nwhere formula_7 is the ideal pressure and \"A\" is an empirical parameter. The value of the parameter \"A\" (and of parameters from higher-order approximations) can be used to calculate Pitzer parameters. Empirical parameters are used to quantify the behavior of solutions of ionic and non-ionic solutes which are not ideal solutions in the thermodynamic sense.\nThe Pfeffer cell was developed for the measurement of osmotic pressure.\nApplications.\nOsmotic pressure measurement may be used for the determination of molecular weights.\nOsmotic pressure is an important factor affecting biological cells. Osmoregulation is the homeostasis mechanism of an organism to reach balance in osmotic pressure.\nWhen a biological cell is in a hypotonic environment, the cell interior accumulates water, water flows across the cell membrane into the cell, causing it to expand. In plant cells, the cell wall restricts the expansion, resulting in pressure on the cell wall from within called turgor pressure. Turgor pressure allows herbaceous plants to stand upright. It is also the determining factor for how plants regulate the aperture of their stomata. In animal cells excessive osmotic pressure can result in cytolysis due to the absence of a cell wall.\nOsmotic pressure is the basis of filtering (\"reverse osmosis\"), a process commonly used in water purification. The water to be purified is placed in a chamber and put under an amount of pressure greater than the osmotic pressure exerted by the water and the solutes dissolved in it. Part of the chamber opens to a differentially permeable membrane that lets water molecules through, but not the solute particles. The osmotic pressure of ocean water is approximately 27 atm. Reverse osmosis desalinates fresh water from ocean salt water and is applied globally on a very large scale.\nDerivation of the van\u00a0't Hoff formula.\nConsider the system at the point when it has reached equilibrium. The condition for this is that the chemical potential of the \"solvent\" (since only it is free to flow toward equilibrium) on both sides of the membrane is equal. The compartment containing the pure solvent has a chemical potential of formula_8, where formula_9 is the pressure. On the other side, in the compartment containing the solute, the chemical potential of the solvent depends on the mole fraction of the solvent, formula_10. Besides, this compartment can assume a different pressure, formula_11. We can therefore write the chemical potential of the solvent as formula_12. If we write formula_13, the balance of the chemical potential is therefore:\nformula_14\nHere, the difference in pressure of the two compartments formula_15 is defined as the osmotic pressure exerted by the solutes. Holding the pressure, the addition of solute decreases the chemical potential (an entropic effect). Thus, the pressure of the solution has to be increased in an effort to compensate the loss of the chemical potential.\nIn order to find formula_4, the osmotic pressure, we consider equilibrium between a solution containing solute and pure water.\nformula_17\nWe can write the left hand side as:\nformula_18,\nwhere formula_19 is the activity coefficient of the solvent. The product formula_20 is also known as the activity of the solvent, which for water is the water activity formula_21. The addition to the pressure is expressed through the expression for the energy of expansion:\nformula_22\nwhere formula_23 is the molar volume (m\u00b3/mol). Inserting the expression presented above into the chemical potential equation for the entire system and rearranging will arrive at:\nformula_24\nIf the liquid is incompressible the molar volume is constant, formula_25, and the integral becomes formula_26. Thus, we get\nformula_27\nThe activity coefficient is a function of concentration and temperature, but in the case of dilute mixtures, it is often very close to 1.0, so\nformula_28\nThe mole fraction of solute, formula_29, is formula_30, so formula_31 can be replaced with formula_32, which, when formula_29 is small, can be approximated by formula_34.\nformula_35\nThe mole fraction formula_29 is formula_37. When formula_29 is small, it may be approximated by formula_39. Also, the molar volume formula_23 may be written as volume per mole, formula_41. Combining these gives the following.\nformula_42\nFor aqueous solutions of salts, ionisation must be taken into account. For example, 1 mole of NaCl ionises to 2 moles of ions.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

TAFE institutions provide a wide range of predominantly vocational courses.\nIndividual TAFE institutions (usually with numerous campuses) are known as either colleges or institutes, depending on the state or territory. \nIn Australia, where the term TAFE originated, institutions usually host qualifying courses, under the National Training System/Australian Qualifications Framework/VET Quality Framework. Fields covered include business, finance, hospitality, tourism, construction, engineering, visual arts, information technology and community work. TAFE colleges are owned, operated and financed by the various state/territory governments.\nQualifications awarded by TAFE colleges.\nTAFE colleges award Australian Qualifications Framework (AQF) qualifications accredited in the Vocational Education and Training (VET) sector that align to Certificate I, Certificate II, Certificate III, Certificate IV, Diploma, Advanced Diploma, Graduate Certificate and Graduate Diploma qualifications. In many instances, TAFE study at a Diploma or above level can be used as partial credit towards bachelor's degree-level university programs.\nFrom 2002 the TAFE education sector has been able to offer bachelor's degrees and post-graduate diploma courses to fill niche areas, particularly vocationally focused areas of study based on industry needs. As of June 2009, ten TAFE colleges (mainly in New South Wales and Victoria, but also Western Australia, ACT, and Queensland) now confer their own degree-level awards and post graduate diplomas, though initially not beyond the level of bachelor's degree. However Melbourne Polytechnic was accredited in 2015 to offer two master's degree courses. Similarly, some universities (e.g., Charles Darwin University, Squidward Community College, and Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology) offer vocational education courses (traditionally the domain of TAFE); these are funded by the local state and territory governments. Some high schools also deliver courses developed and accredited by TAFEs.\nStudents who enrol in these undergraduate degree courses at TAFE are required to pay full fees and are not entitled to Commonwealth Government supported student fee loans, known as HECS loans, but may access a FEE-HELP loan scheme. While Universities have the ability and power to design and offer their own degree courses, each TAFE degree course must be assessed and approved by the Higher Education Accreditation Committee (HEAC).\nTAFEs in some states can also teach senior high school qualifications, like the Victorian Certificate of Education, Victorian Certificate of Applied Learning, and the Higher School Certificate. Some universities, e.g. Charles Darwin University and Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology, offer TAFE courses; these are funded by the local state and territory governments. Some high schools also deliver courses developed and accredited by TAFEs.\nSome private institutions also offer courses from TAFEs, however they more commonly offer other vocational education and training courses. Before the 1990s, the TAFEs had a near monopoly in the sector. TAFE courses provide students an opportunity for certificate, diploma, and advanced diploma qualifications in a wide range of areas.\nTAFE colleges by state/territory.\nIn most cases, TAFE campuses are grouped into TAFE institutions or \"institutes\" along geographic lines. Most TAFEs are given a locally recognised region of the country where they exclusively operate covering a wide range of subjects.\nA few TAFEs specialise in a single area of study. These are usually found near the middle of the capital cities, and they service the whole state or territory. For example, the Trade and Technician Skills Institute in Brisbane, from 1 July 2006, has specialised in automotive, building and construction, manufacturing and engineering, and electrical/electronic studies for students throughout Queensland and the William Angliss Institute of TAFE in Melbourne has specialised in food, hospitality and tourism courses for Victoria.\nAustralian Capital Territory.\nIn the Australian Capital Territory, these include:\nNew South Wales.\nThere were ten TAFE NSW Institutes in NSW, which have since been joined into a state-wide service.

{"id": "31388", "revid": "50972979", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31388", "title": "Treaty of Brest-Litovsk", "text": "1918 treaty between Soviet Russia and the Central Powers\nThe Treaty of Brest-Litovsk was a separate peace treaty signed on 3 March 1918 between Soviet Russia and the Central Powers (Germany, Austria-Hungary, the Ottoman Empire, and Bulgaria), by which Russia withdrew from World War I. The treaty, which followed months of negotiations after the armistice on the Eastern Front in December 1917, was signed at Brest-Litovsk (now Brest, Belarus).\nThe Soviet delegation was initially headed by Adolph Joffe, and key figures from the Central Powers included Max Hoffmann and Richard von K\u00fchlmann of Germany, Ottokar Czernin of Austria-Hungary, and Talaat Pasha of the Ottoman Empire. In January 1918, the Central Powers demanded secession of all occupied territories of the former Russian Empire. The Soviets sent a new peace delegation led by Leon Trotsky, which aimed to stall the negotiations while awaiting revolutions in Central Europe. A renewed Central Powers offensive launched on February 18 captured large territories in the Baltic region, Belarus, and Ukraine and forced the Soviet side to sue for peace.\nUnder the terms of the treaty, Russia lost control of Ukraine, Poland, Belarus, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, and its Caucasian province of Kars and Batum. The lands comprised 34% of the former empire's population, 54% of its industrial land, 89% of its coalfields, and 26% of its railways. The Soviet government also confirmed the independence of Finland, which it had recognized in January 1918, and pledged to end its war with the Ukrainian People's Republic, which the Central Powers had recognized under the prior Treaty of Brest-Litovsk (9 February 1918). A supplementary protocol signed in August 1918 required Russia to pay Germany war reparations of six billion marks. The treaty was controversial in Russia, giving a unifying cause to the White movement and opening a rift between the Bolsheviks and the Left Socialist-Revolutionaries, whose representatives withdrew from the Council of People's Commissars after its signing and later rebelled in the Left SR Uprising.\nThe treaty was annulled by the Armistice of 11 November 1918, in which Germany surrendered to the western Allied Powers. Subsequent attempts by the Soviets to restore power in the lost territories during the Russian Civil War (1917\u20131922) had mixed results, with the Red Army being defeated in the independence wars of the three Baltic countries and in the Polish\u2013Soviet War, but successfully conquering Belarus early on, later achieving victory in its invasions of Azerbaijan, Armenia, Georgia and in Ukraine. The border with Turkey established by the treaty was largely affirmed by the Treaty of Kars (1921). Under the Treaty of Rapallo (1922), Russia and Germany renounced all territorial and financial claims against each other.\nThe Russian borders established by the treaty are almost exactly the same as the post-1991 borders established after the fall of the Soviet Union.\nBackground.\nBy 1917, Germany, Austria-Hungary and Russia were stuck in a stalemate on the Eastern Front of World War I and the Russian economy had nearly collapsed under the strain of the war effort. The large numbers of war casualties and persistent food shortages in the major urban centers brought about civil unrest, known as the February Revolution, that forced Tsar Nicholas II to abdicate. The Russian Provisional Government that replaced the Tsar in early 1917 continued the war. Foreign Minister Pavel Milyukov sent the Entente Powers a telegram, known as the Milyukov note, affirming to them that the Provisional Government would continue the war with the same war aims that the former Russian Empire had. The pro-war Provisional Government was opposed by the self-proclaimed Petrograd Soviet of Workers' and Soldiers' Deputies, dominated by leftist parties. Its Order No. 1 called for an overriding mandate to soldier committees rather than army officers. The Soviet started to form its own paramilitary power, the Red Guards, in March 1917.\nThe continuing war led the German Government to agree to a suggestion that they should favour the opposition Communist Party (Bolsheviks), who were proponents of Russia's withdrawal from the war. Therefore, in April 1917, Germany transported Bolshevik leader Vladimir Lenin and 31 supporters in a sealed train from exile in Switzerland to Finland Station, Petrograd. Upon his arrival in Petrograd, Lenin proclaimed his April Theses, which included a call for turning all political power over to workers' and soldiers' soviets (councils) and an immediate withdrawal of Russia from the war. At around the same time, the United States entered the war, potentially shifting the balance of the war against the Central Powers. Throughout 1917, Bolsheviks called for the overthrow of the Provisional Government and an end to the war. Following the disastrous failure of the Kerensky offensive, discipline in the Russian army deteriorated completely. Soldiers would disobey orders, often under the influence of Bolshevik agitation, and set up soldiers' committees to take control of their units after deposing the officers.\nThe defeat and ongoing hardships of war led to anti-government riots in Petrograd, the \"July Days\" of 1917. Several months later, on 7 November [O.S. 25 October], Red Guards seized the Winter Palace and arrested the Provisional Government in what is known as the October Revolution.\nA top priority of the newly established Soviet government was to end the war. On 8 November [O.S.\u00a026\u00a0October] Lenin signed the Decree on Peace, which was approved by the Second Congress of the Soviet of Workers', Soldiers', and Peasants' Deputies. The Decree called \"upon all the belligerent nations and their governments to start immediate negotiations for peace\" and proposed an immediate withdrawal of Russia from World War I. Leon Trotsky was appointed Commissar of Foreign Affairs in the new Bolshevik government. In preparation for peace talks with the representatives of the German government and the representatives of the other Central Powers, Trotsky appointed his good friend Adolph Joffe to represent the Bolsheviks at the peace conference.\nPeace negotiations.\nOn 15 December 1917, an armistice between Soviet Russia and the Central Powers was concluded. On 22 December, peace negotiations began in Brest-Litovsk.\nArrangements for the conference were the responsibility of General Max Hoffmann, the chief of staff of the Central Powers' forces on the Eastern Front (, ). The delegations that had negotiated the armistice were made stronger. Prominent additions on the Central Powers' side were the foreign ministers of Germany, Richard von K\u00fchlmann, and Austria-Hungary, Count Ottokar Czernin, both the Ottoman grand vizier Talaat Pasha and Foreign Minister Nassimy Bey. The Bulgarians were headed by Minister of Justice Popoff, who was later joined by Prime Minister Vasil Radoslavov.\nThe Soviet delegation was led by Joffe, who had already led their armistice negotiators, but his group was made more cohesive by eliminating most of the representatives of social groups, like peasants and sailors, and the addition of tsarist general Aleksandr Samoilo and the noted Marxist historian Mikhail Pokrovsky. It still included Anastasia Bitsenko, a former assassin, representing the Left Socialist-Revolutionaries who were at odds with the Bolsheviks. Again, the negotiators met in the fortress in Brest-Litovsk, and the delegates were housed in temporary wooden structures in its courtyards because the city had been burnt to the ground in 1915 by the retreating Russian army. They were cordially welcomed by the German commander of the Eastern Front, Prince Leopold of Bavaria, who sat with Joffe on the head table at the opening banquet with one hundred guests. As they had during the armistice negotiations, both sides continued to eat dinner and supper together amicably intermingled in the officers' mess.\nWhen the conference convened K\u00fchlmann asked Joffe to present the Russian conditions for peace. He made six points, all variations of the Bolshevik slogan of peace with \"no annexations or indemnities\". The Central Powers accepted the principles \"but only in case all belligerents [including the nations of the Entente] without exception pledge themselves to do the same\". They did not intend to annex territories occupied by force. Joffe telegraphed the marvelous news to Petrograd. Thanks to informal chatting in the mess, one of Hoffmann's aides, Colonel Friedrich Brinckmann, realized that the Russians had optimistically misinterpreted the Central Powers' meaning. It fell to Hoffmann to set matters straight at dinner on 27 December: Poland, Lithuania and Courland, already occupied by the Central Powers, were determined to separate from Russia on the principle of self-determination that the Bolsheviks themselves espoused. Joffe \"looked as if he had received a blow on the head\". Pokrovsky wept as he asked how they could speak of \"peace without annexations when Germany was tearing eighteen provinces away from the Russian state\". The Germans and the Austro-Hungarians planned to annex slices of Polish territory and to set up a rump Polish state with what remained. The Baltic governorates were to become client states ruled by German princes. Czernin was beside himself that this hitch that was slowing the negotiations; self-determination was anathema to his government and they urgently needed grain from the east because Vienna was on the verge of starvation. He proposed to make a separate peace. K\u00fchlmann warned that if they negotiated separately, Germany would immediately withdraw all its divisions from the Austrian front; Czernin dropped that threat. The food crisis in Vienna was eventually eased by \"forced drafts of grain from Hungary, Poland, and Romania and by a last moment contribution from Germany of 450 truck-loads of flour\". At Russian request, they agreed to recess the talks for 12 days.\nThe Soviets' only hopes were that time would make their allies agree to join the negotiations or that the western European proletariat would revolt and so their best strategy was to prolong the negotiations. As Trotsky wrote, \"To delay negotiations, there must be someone to do the delaying\". Therefore, Trotsky replaced Joffe as the leader.\nOn the other side were significant political realignments. On New Year's Day in Berlin, Kaiser Wilhelm II insisted that Hoffmann reveal his views on the future German\u2013Polish border. He advocated taking a small slice of Poland; Paul von Hindenburg and Erich Ludendorff wanted much more. They were furious with Hoffmann for breaching the chain of command and wanted him to be dismissed and sent to command a division. The Kaiser refused, but Ludendorff no longer spoke with Hoffmann on the telephone since the communication was now through an intermediary.\nThe German Supreme Commanders were also furious at ruling out of annexations, contending that the peace \"must increase Germany's material power\". They denigrated K\u00fchlmann and pressed for additional territorial acquisitions. When Hindenburg was asked why they needed the Baltic provinces he replied, \"To secure my left flank for when the next war happens.\" However, the most profound transformation was that a delegation from the Ukrainian Rada, which had declared independence from Russia, had arrived at Brest-Litovsk. They would make peace if they were given the Polish city of Cholm and its surroundings, and they would provide desperately needed grain. Czernin no longer was desperate for a prompt settlement with the Russians.\nWhen they reconvened, Trotsky declined the invitation to meet Prince Leopold and terminated shared meals and other sociable interactions with the representatives of the Central Powers. Day after day, Trotsky \"engaged K\u00fchlmann in debate, rising to subtle discussion of first principles that ranged far beyond the concrete territorial issues that divided them\". The Central Powers signed a peace treaty with Ukraine during the night of 8\u20139 February even though the Russians had retaken Kiev. German and Austro-Hungarian troops entered Ukraine to prop up the Rada. Finally, Hoffmann broke the impasse with the Russians by focusing the discussion on maps of the future boundaries. Trotsky summarised their situation \"Germany and Austria-Hungary are cutting off from the domains of the former Russian Empire territories more than 150,000 square kilometers in size\". He was granted a nine-day recess for the Russians to decide whether to sign.\nIn Petrograd, Trotsky argued passionately against signing and proposed that instead, \"they should announce the termination of the war and demobilization without signing any peace.\" Privately, in correspondence with Count Otto von Czernin, Trotsky had expressed his willingness to relent to peace terms upon the resumption of a German offensive although with moral dissent. Lenin was for signing rather than having an even more ruinous treaty forced on them after a few more weeks of military humiliation. The \"Left Communists\", led by Nikolai Bukharin and Karl Radek, were sure that Germany, Austria-Hungary, the Ottoman Empire, and Bulgaria were all on the verge of revolution. They wanted to continue the war with a newly raised revolutionary force while awaiting these upheavals. Consequently, Lenin agreed to Trotsky's formula \u2013 a position summed up as \"no war \u2013 no peace\" \u2013 which was announced when the negotiators reconvened on 10 February 1918. The Soviets thought that their stalling was succeeding until 16 February when Hoffmann notified them that the war would resume in two days, when 53 divisions advanced against the near-empty Soviet trenches. On the night of 18 February, the Central Committee supported Lenin's resolution that they sign the treaty by a margin of seven to five. Hoffmann kept advancing until 23 February when he presented new terms that included the withdrawal of all Soviet troops from Ukraine and Finland. The Soviets were given 48 hours to open negotiations with the Germans, and another 72 to conclude them. Lenin told the Central Committee that \"you must sign this shameful peace in order to save the world revolution\". If they did not agree, he would resign. He was supported by six Central Committee members, opposed by three, with Trotsky and three others abstaining. Debate in the All-Russian Central Executive Committee was intense, with Left SRs jeering Lenin as a traitor. Lenin explained that they must \"concede space...in order to win time.\" The measure passed 116 to 85.\nTrotsky resigned as foreign minister and was replaced by Georgy Chicherin.\nWhen Sokolnikov arrived at Brest-Litovsk, he declared \"we are going to sign immediately the treaty presented to us as an ultimatum but at the same time refuse to enter into any discussion of its terms\". The treaty was signed at 17:50 on 3 March 1918.\nK\u00fchlmann, invited Emil Orl\u00edk, a Viennese Secessionist and artist, to attend the conference. He composed portraits of all the participants along with a series of smaller caricatures. These were gathered together into a book, copies of which were distributed to each participant at the end of the negotiations.\nTerms.\nSigning.\nThe Treaty of Brest-Litovsk was signed on 3 March 1918. The signatories were Soviet Russia signed by Grigori Sokolnikov on the one side and Germany, Austria-Hungary, Bulgaria, and the Ottoman Empire on the other.\nThe treaty marked Russia's final withdrawal from World War I as an enemy of her co-signatories, on severe terms. In all, the treaty took away territory that included a quarter of the population and the industry of the former Russian Empire and nine tenths of its operational coal mines.\nTerritorial cessions in eastern Europe.\nRussia renounced all territorial claims in Finland (whose independence it had already recognized), Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, most of Belarus, and Ukraine. The territory of the Kingdom of Poland was not mentioned in the treaty, as the Germans refused to recognize the existence of any Polish representatives, which in turn led to Polish protests. The treaty stated that \"Germany and Austria-Hungary intend to determine the future fate of these territories in agreement with their populations.\" Most of the territories were in effect ceded to Germany, which intended to have them become economic and political dependencies, where the local German-speaking minority would be the ruling elite. New monarchies were to be created in Lithuania and the proposed \"United Baltic Duchy\" (which was planned to comprise Latvia and Estonia). Later in 1918, German aristocrats Wilhelm Karl, Duke of Urach (for Lithuania), and Adolf Friedrich, Duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin (for the planned United Baltic Duchy), were nominally appointed, but in reality never became, rulers of these envisaged new pro-German countries.\nThis plan was detailed by Ludendorff, who wrote, \"German prestige demands that we should hold a strong protecting hand, not only over German citizens, but over all Germans.\"\nThe occupation of the western part of the former Russian Empire ultimately proved a costly blunder for Berlin, as over one million German troops lay sprawled out from Poland nearly to the Caspian Sea, all idle and depriving Germany of badly needed manpower in France. The hopes of using Ukraine's grain and coal proved abortive; in addition, the local population became increasingly hostile to the occupation. Revolts and guerrilla warfare began breaking out all over the occupied territory, many of them inspired by Bolshevik agents. German troops also had to intervene in the Finnish Civil War, and Ludendorff became increasingly concerned that his troops were being affected by propaganda emanating from Moscow, which was one of the reasons he was reluctant to transfer divisions to the Western Front. The attempt at establishing an independent Ukrainian state under German guidance was unsuccessful as well. However, Ludendorff completely ruled out the idea of marching on Moscow and Petrograd to remove the Bolshevik government from power.\nGermany transferred hundreds of thousands of veteran troops to the Western Front for the 1918 Spring Offensive, which shocked the Allied Powers but ultimately failed. Some Germans later blamed the occupation for significantly weakening the Spring Offensive. The Germans began slowly but steadily withdrawing personnel from the occupied territories from east to west as the troop transfers to the Western Front continued throughout 1918. Local independence movements, particularly those based in what is now Belarus and Ukraine, moved in to fill the void the Germans left behind and established themselves in the newly freed territories.\nBelarus and Ukraine became independent, while Poland, Estonia, Livonia, and Courland become protectorates of the German Empire. Later, Bessarabia united with Romania.\nRussia lost 34% of its population, 54% of its industrial land, 89% of its coalfields, and 26% of its railways. Russia was also fined 6 billion marks.\nTerritorial cessions in the Caucasus.\nAt the insistence of Talaat Pasha, the treaty declared that the territory the Ottoman Empire surrendered to Russia in the Russo-Turkish War (1877\u20131878), specifically Ardahan, Kars, and Batumi, were to be returned. At the time of the treaty, this territory was under the effective control of Armenian and Georgian forces.\nParagraph 3 of Article IV of the treaty stated that:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The districts of Ardahan, Kars, and Batum will likewise and without delay be cleared of Russian troops. Russia will not interfere in the reorganization of the national and international relations of these districts, but leave it to the population of these districts to carry out this reorganization in agreement with the neighbouring states, especially with the Ottoman Empire.\nArmenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia rejected the treaty and instead declared independence. They formed the short-lived Transcaucasian Democratic Federative Republic.\nSoviet-German financial agreement of August 1918.\nIn the wake of Soviet repudiation of Tsarist bonds, the nationalisation of foreign-owned property and confiscation of foreign assets, and Entente forces landing on Russian territory, the Soviets and Germany signed an additional agreement on 27 August 1918. The Soviets agreed to pay six billion marks in compensation for German losses.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;ARTICLE 2\nRussia shall pay Germany six billion marks as compensation for losses sustained by Germans through Russian measures; at the same time corresponding claims on Russia's part are taken into account, and the value of supplies confiscated in Russia by German military forces after the conclusion of peace is taken into account.\nThe amount was equal to 300 million rubles. The Soviets additionally agreed to sell Germany 25% of the output of the Baku oil fields.\nThree secret clauses provided for German military action against Entente forces on Russian soil, as well as the expulsion of British troops from Baku.\nLasting effects.\nThe treaty freed up a million German soldiers for the Western Front and allowed Germany to use \"much of Russia's food supply, industrial base, fuel supplies, and communications with Western Europe\". According to historian Spencer Tucker, the Allied Powers felt thatThe treaty was the ultimate betrayal of the Allied cause and sowed the seeds for the Cold War. With Brest-Litovsk, the spectre of German domination in Eastern Europe threatened to become reality, and the Allies now began to think seriously about military intervention [in Russia].For the Western Allied Powers, the terms that Germany had imposed on Russia were interpreted as a warning of what to expect if the Central Powers won the war. Between Brest-Litovsk and the point when the situation in the Western Front became dire, some officials in the German government and the high command began to favour offering more lenient terms to the Allied Powers in exchange for their recognition of German gains in the east.\nThe treaty marked a significant contraction of the territory controlled by the Bolsheviks or that they could lay claim to as effective successors of the Russian Empire. While the independence of Poland was already accepted by them in principle, and Lenin had signed a document accepting the Finnish independence, the loss of Ukraine and the Baltics created, from the Bolshevik perspective, dangerous bases of anti-Bolshevik military activity in the subsequent Russian Civil War (1917\u20131923). However, Bolshevik control of Ukraine and Transcaucasia was, at the time, fragile or non-existent.\nMany Russian nationalists and some revolutionaries were furious at the Bolsheviks' acceptance of the treaty and joined forces to fight them. Non-Russians who inhabited the lands lost by Bolshevik Russia in the treaty saw the changes as an opportunity to set up independent states.\nImmediately after the signing of the treaty, Lenin moved the Soviet government from Petrograd to Moscow to prevent Germany from capturing the Russian capital in the event of an invasion. Trotsky blamed the peace treaty on the bourgeoisie, the social revolutionaries, Tsarist diplomats, Tsarist bureaucrats, \"the Kerenskys, Tseretelis and Chernovs\", the Tsarist regime, and the \"petty-bourgeois compromisers\".\nThe treaty opened a permanent rift between the Bolsheviks and Left SRs. In July 1918 the Left SRs assassinated German Ambassador Wilhelm von Mirbach in the hopes that it would induce Germany to annul the treaty, leading to the Left SR Uprising.\nRelations between Russia and the Central Powers did not go smoothly. The Ottoman Empire broke the treaty by invading the newly created First Republic of Armenia in May 1918. Joffe became the Russian ambassador to Germany. His priority was distributing propaganda to trigger the German revolution. On 4 November 1918, \"the Soviet courier's packing-case had 'come to pieces'\" in a Berlin railway station; it was filled with insurrectionary documents. Joffe and his staff were ejected from Germany in a sealed train on 5 November 1918. In the Armistice of 11 November 1918 that ended World War I, one clause abrogated the Brest-Litovsk treaty. Next, the Bolshevik legislature (VTsIK) annulled the treaty on 13 November 1918, and the text of the VTsIK Decision was printed in the newspaper \"Pravda\" the next day.\nIn the year after the armistice following a timetable set by the victors, the German Army withdrew its occupying forces from the lands gained in Brest-Litovsk. However, relations between Russia and the Allied Powers were also bad due to the Allied Powers' intervention in the Russian Civil War against the Soviet government of Russia and its allies. The fate of the region, and the location of the eventual western border of the Soviet Union, was settled in violent and chaotic struggles over the course of the next three and a half years. The Polish\u2013Soviet War was particularly bitter; it ended with the Treaty of Riga in 1921. Although most of Ukraine and Belarus fell under Bolshevik control and eventually became two of the constituent republics of the Soviet Union, Poland and the Baltic states re-emerged as independent nations. In the Treaty of Rapallo, concluded in April 1922, Germany accepted the Treaty's nullification, and the two powers agreed to abandon all war-related territorial and financial claims against each other.\nThis state of affairs lasted until 1939, when after signing the secret protocol to the Nazi-Soviet pact, the Soviet Union was able to advance its borders westward by invading Poland in September 1939, by conquering parts of eastern Finland in the 1939\u20131940 Winter War, and by invading and occupying Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and parts of Romania (Bessarabia and northern Bukovina) in 1940. During World War II the Soviet leadership was thus able to overturn the majority of the territorial losses incurred at Brest-Litovsk, except for the larger part of Finland and western Congress Poland.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
