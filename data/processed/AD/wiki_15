The band has undergone several line-up changes since their reunion in 2006, with Corgan being the primary songwriter and sole constant member since its inception. The current lineup consists of Corgan, Iha, and Chamberlin. The band is known for its diverse, densely layered sound, which evolved throughout their career and has integrated elements of gothic rock, heavy metal, grunge, psychedelic rock, progressive rock, shoegaze, dream pop, and electronica.\nThe band's debut album, \"Gish\" (1991), was well-received by critics and became an underground success. In the advent of alternative rock's mainstream breakthrough, their second album, \"Siamese Dream\" (1993), established the band's popularity. Despite a tumultuous recording process, the album received widespread acclaim and has been lauded as one of the best albums in the genre. Their third album, \"Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness\" (1995), furthered the band's popularity; it debuted atop the \"Billboard\" 200, received a Diamond certification from the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), and continued the band's critical success. After the release of \"Adore\" (1998) and a two-part project in 2000\u2014\"Machina\" and \"Machina II\"\u2014the group disbanded due to internal conflicts, drug use, and diminishing sales by the end of the 1990s. With 30\u00a0million albums sold worldwide, the Smashing Pumpkins were among the most critically and commercially successful bands of the 1990s, and an important act in the popularization of alternative rock.\nIn 2006, Corgan and Chamberlin reconvened to record the band's seventh album, \"Zeitgeist\". After touring throughout 2007 and 2008 with a lineup including new guitarist Jeff Schroeder, Chamberlin left the band in early 2009. Later that year, Corgan began a new recording series with a rotating lineup of musicians entitled \"Teargarden by Kaleidyscope\", which encompassed stand-alone singles, EP releases, and two full albums that also fell under the project's scope\u2014\"Oceania\" in 2012 and \"Monuments to an Elegy\" in 2014. Chamberlin became a touring member in 2015, before officially rejoining with Iha in 2018. The reunited lineup then released the albums ' (2018) and \"Cyr\" (2020), in addition to ' across three increments between 2022 and 2023. Schroeder departed from the band in October 2023. Following Schroeder's departure, the band's remaining members released \"Aghori Mhori Mei\" (2024).\nHistory.\nEarly years: 1988\u20131991.\nAfter the breakup of his gothic rock and metal band the Marked, singer and guitarist Billy Corgan left St. Petersburg, Florida and returned to his native city of Chicago, where he took a job in a record store and had the idea to start a band called the Smashing Pumpkins. While working at the store he met guitarist James Iha. Adorning themselves with paisley and other psychedelic trappings, the two began writing songs (with the aid of a drum machine) which were heavily influenced by the Cure and New Order. The duo performed live for the first time on July 9, 1988, at the Polish bar Chicago 21. This performance included only Corgan on bass and Iha on guitar with a drum machine. Shortly thereafter, Corgan met D'arcy Wretzky after a show by the Dan Reed Network where they argued the merits of a band. After finding out that Wretzky played bass guitar, Corgan got her to join the band and the trio played a show at the Avalon Nightclub. After the show, Cabaret Metro owner Joe Shanahan agreed to book the band on the condition that they replace the drum\nmachine with a live drummer.\nJazz drummer Jimmy Chamberlin was recommended by a friend of Corgan's. Chamberlin knew little of alternative music and immediately changed the sound of the nascent band. As Corgan recalled of the period, \"We were completely into the sad-rock, Cure kind of thing. It took about two or three practices before I realized that the power in his playing was something that enabled us to rock harder than we could ever have imagined.\" On October 5, 1988, the complete band took the stage for the first time at the Cabaret Metro.\nIn 1989, the Smashing Pumpkins made their first appearance on record with the compilation album \"Light Into Dark\", which featured several Chicago alternative bands. The group released its first single, \"I Am One\", in 1990 on the local Chicago label Limited Potential. The single sold out and they released a follow-up, \"Tristessa\", on Sub Pop; then they signed to Caroline Records. The band recorded their 1991 debut studio album \"Gish\" with producer Butch Vig at his Smart Studios in Madison, Wisconsin, for $. In order to gain the consistency he desired, Corgan often played all instruments excluding drums, which created tension in the band. The music fused heavy metal guitars, psychedelia, and dream pop, garnering them comparisons to Jane's Addiction. \"Gish\" became a minor success, with the single \"Rhinoceros\" receiving some airplay on modern rock radio. After releasing the \"Lull\" EP in October 1991 on Caroline Records, the band formally signed with Virgin Records, which was affiliated with Caroline. The band supported the album with a tour that included opening for bands such as the Red Hot Chili Peppers, Jane's Addiction, and Guns N' Roses. During the tour, Iha and Wretzky went through a messy breakup, Chamberlin became addicted to narcotics and alcohol, and Corgan entered a deep depression, writing some songs for the upcoming album in the parking garage where he lived at the time.\nMainstream breakout and \"Siamese Dream\": 1992\u20131994.\nWith the breakthrough of alternative rock into the American mainstream due to the popularity of grunge bands such as Nirvana and Pearl Jam, the Smashing Pumpkins were poised for major commercial success. At this time, the Smashing Pumpkins were routinely lumped in with the grunge movement, with Corgan protesting, \"We've graduated now from 'the next Jane's Addiction' to 'the next Nirvana', now we're 'the next Pearl Jam'.\"\nAmid this environment of intense internal pressure for the band to break through to widespread popularity, the band relocated to Marietta, Georgia, in late 1992 to begin work on their second album, with Butch Vig returning as producer. The decision to record so far away from their hometown was motivated partly by the band's desire to avoid friends and distractions during the recording, but largely as a desperate attempt to cut Chamberlin off from his known drug connections. The recording environment for \"Siamese Dream\" was quickly marred by discord within the band. As was the case with \"Gish\", Corgan and Vig decided that Corgan should play nearly all of the guitar and bass parts on the album, contributing to an air of resentment. The contemporary music press began to portray Corgan as a tyrant. Corgan's depression, meanwhile, had deepened to the point where he contemplated suicide, and he compensated by practically living in the studio. Meanwhile, Chamberlin quickly managed to find new connections and was often absent without any contact for days at a time. In all, it took over four months to complete the record, with the budget exceeding $.\nDespite all the problems in its recording, \"Siamese Dream\" became the band's mainstream breakthrough, peaking at number ten on the \"Billboard\" 200 chart and selling over four million copies in the U.S. alone. Alongside the band's mounting mainstream recognition, the band's reputation as careerists among their former peers in the independent music community was worsened. Indie rock band Pavement's 1994 song \"Range Life\" directly mocks the band in its lyrics, although Stephen Malkmus, lead singer of Pavement, has stated, \"I never dissed their music. I just dissed their status.\" Former H\u00fcsker D\u00fc frontman Bob Mould called them \"the grunge Monkees\", and fellow Chicago musician/producer Steve Albini wrote a scathing letter in response to an article praising the band, derisively comparing them to REO Speedwagon (\"by, of and for the mainstream\") and concluding their ultimate insignificance. Fred Armisen said the band simply \"flew past us\" in the 90s Chicago music scene after his own band Trenchmouth had produced five albums. The opening track and lead single of \"Siamese Dream\", \"Cherub Rock\", directly addresses Corgan's feud with the \"indie-world\". In spite of the backlash, \"Siamese Dream\" is often regarded as one of the greatest albums of the alternative rock genre, and one of the best albums of the 1990s.\nIn 1994 Virgin released the B-sides/rarities compilation \"Pisces Iscariot\" which charted higher than \"Siamese Dream\" by reaching number four on the \"Billboard\" 200. Also released was a VHS cassette titled \"Vieuphoria\" featuring a mix of live performances and behind-the-scenes footage. For Christmas 1994 Corgan gave ten copies of an informally self-released five-CD box set, \"Mashed Potatoes\", to close friends of the band. It contained early demos, interview snippets and live recordings dating from 1988 to 1993. Music journalist Ned Raggett called it \"the holy grail of Smashing Pumpkins collectibles for the hardcore fanatic\". It became available online in the early 2000s.\n\"Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness\": 1995\u20131997.\nDuring 1995, Corgan wrote about 56 songs, following which the band went into the studio with producers Flood and Alan Moulder to work on what Corgan described as \"\"The Wall\" for Generation X\", and which became \"Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness\", a double album of twenty-eight songs, lasting over two hours (the vinyl version of the album contained three records, two extra songs, and an alternate track listing). The songs were intended to hang together conceptually as a symbol of the cycle of life and death. Praised by \"Time\" as \"the group's most ambitious and accomplished work yet\", \"Mellon Collie\" debuted at number one on the \"Billboard\" 200 in October 1995. Even more successful than \"Siamese Dream\", it was certified ten times platinum in the United States and became the best-selling double album of the decade. It also garnered seven 1997 Grammy Award nominations, including Album of the Year. The band won only the Best Hard Rock Performance award, for the album's lead single \"Bullet with Butterfly Wings\". The album spawned five singles\u2014\"Bullet with Butterfly Wings\", \"1979\", \"Zero\", \"Tonight, Tonight\" which Corgan stated was inspired by the Cheap Trick song \"I'll Be with You Tonight\", and \"Thirty-Three\"\u2014of which the first three were certified gold and all but \"Zero\" entered the Top 40. Many of the songs that did not make it onto \"Mellon Collie\" were released as B-sides to the singles, and were later compiled in \"The Aeroplane Flies High\" box set. The set was originally limited to 200,000 copies, but more were produced to meet demand.\nIn 1996 the Pumpkins undertook an extended world tour in support of \"Mellon Collie\". Corgan's look during this period\u2014a shaved head, a long-sleeve black shirt with the word \"Zero\" printed on it, and silver pants\u2014became iconic. That year, the band also made a guest appearance in an episode of \"The Simpsons\", \"Homerpalooza\". With considerable video rotation on MTV, major industry awards, and \"Zero\" shirts selling in many malls, the Pumpkins were considered one of the most popular bands of the time.\nIn May, the Smashing Pumpkins played a gig at the Point Theatre in Dublin, Ireland. Despite the band's repeated requests for moshing to stop, a seventeen-year-old fan named Bernadette O'Brien was crushed to death. The concert ended early and the following night's performance in Belfast was cancelled out of respect for her. However, while Corgan maintained that moshing's \"time [had] come and gone\", the band would continue to request open-floor concerts throughout the rest of the tour.\nThe band suffered a personal tragedy on the night of July 11, 1996, when touring keyboardist Jonathan Melvoin and Chamberlin overdosed on heroin in a hotel room in New York City. Melvoin died, and Chamberlin was arrested for drug possession. A few days later, the band announced that Chamberlin had been fired as a result of the incident. The Pumpkins chose to finish the tour, and hired drummer Matt Walker and keyboardist Dennis Flemion. Corgan later said the decision to continue touring was the worst decision the band had ever made, damaging both their music and their reputation. Chamberlin admitted in a 1994 \"Rolling Stone\" cover story that in the past he'd \"gotten high in every city in this country and probably half the cities in Europe.\" But in recent years, he had reportedly been clean. On July 17, the Pumpkins issued a statement in which they said, \"For nine years we have battled with Jimmy's struggles with the insidious disease of drug and alcohol addiction. It has nearly destroyed everything we are and stand for. \u2026 We wish [him] the best we have to offer\". Meanwhile, the band had given interviews since the release of \"Mellon Collie\" stating that it would be the last conventional Pumpkins record, and that rock was becoming stale. James Iha said at the end of 1996, \"The future is in electronic music. It really seems boring just to play rock music.\"\n\"Adore\", \"Machina\", and breakup: 1998\u20132000.\nAfter the release of \"Mellon Collie\", the Pumpkins contributed many songs to various compilations. Released in early 1997, the song \"Eye\", which appeared on the soundtrack to David Lynch's \"Lost Highway\", relied almost exclusively on electronic instruments and signaled a drastic shift from the Pumpkins' previous musical styles. At the time, Corgan stated his \"idea [was] to reconfigure the focus and get away from the classic guitars-bass-drum rock format.\" Later that year, the group contributed \"The End Is the Beginning Is the End\" to the soundtrack for the film \"Batman &amp; Robin\". With Matt Walker on drums, the song featured a heavy sound similar to \"Bullet with Butterfly Wings\" while still having strong electronic influences. The song later won the 1998 Grammy for Best Hard Rock Performance. Though Corgan announced that the song represented the sound people could expect from the band in the future, the band's next album would feature few guitar-driven songs.\nRecorded following the death of Corgan's mother and his divorce, 1998's \"Adore\" represented a significant change of style from the Pumpkins' previous guitar-based rock, veering into electronica. The record, cut with assistance from drum machines and studio drummers including Matt Walker, was infused with a darker aesthetic than much of the band's earlier work. The group also modified its public image, shedding its alternative rock look for a more subdued appearance. Although \"Adore\" received favorable reviews and was nominated for Best Alternative Performance at the Grammy Awards, the album had only sold about 830,000 copies in the United States by the end of the year. The album nonetheless debuted at number 2 on the \"Billboard\" 200 and sold three times as many copies overseas. The band began a seventeen-date, fifteen-city charity North American tour in support of \"Adore\". At each stop on the tour, the band donated 100 percent of ticket sales to a local charity organization. The tour's expenses were entirely funded out of the band's own pockets. All told, the band donated over $ to charity as a result of the tour. On October 31, 1998, during Halloween, the band opened for Kiss at Dodger Stadium in Los Angeles, dressed in costume as the Beatles.\nDeparture of Wretzky.\nIn 1999 the band surprised fans by reuniting with a rehabilitated Jimmy Chamberlin for a brief tour dubbed \"The Arising\", which showcased both new and classic material. The lineup was short-lived, however, as the band announced the departure of Wretzky in September during work on the album \"Machina/The Machines of God\", and the band was subsequently dropped by Sharon Osbourne Management. Former Hole bassist Melissa Auf der Maur was recruited for the \"Sacred and Profane\" tour in support of the album and appeared in the videos accompanying its release. Released in 2000, \"Machina\" was initially promoted as the Pumpkins' return to a more traditional rock sound, after the more gothic, electronic-sounding \"Adore\". The album debuted at number three on the \"Billboard\" charts, but quickly disappeared and as of 2007 had only been certified gold. Music journalist Jim DeRogatis, who described the album as \"one of the strongest of their career\", noted that the stalled sales for \"Machina\" in comparison to teen pop ascendant at the time \"seems like concrete proof that a new wave of young pop fans has turned a deaf ear toward alternative rock.\"\nOn May 23, 2000, in a live radio interview on KROQ-FM (Los Angeles), Billy Corgan announced the band's decision to break up at the end of that year following additional touring and recording. The group's final album before the break-up, \"Machina II/The Friends &amp; Enemies of Modern Music\", was released in September 2000 in a limited pressing on vinyl with permission and instructions for free redistribution on the Internet by fans. Only twenty-five copies were cut, each of which was hand numbered and given to friends of the band along with band members themselves. The album, released under the Constantinople Records label created by Corgan, consisted of one double LP and three ten-inch EPs. Originally, the band asked Virgin to offer \"Machina II\" as a free download to anyone who bought \"Machina\". When the record label declined, Corgan opted to release the material independently.\nOn December 2, 2000, Smashing Pumpkins played a farewell concert at The Metro, the same Chicago club where their career had effectively started twelve years earlier. The four-and-a-half-hour-long show featured 35 songs spanning the group's career, and attendees were given a recording of the band's first concert at The Metro, \"Live at Cabaret Metro 10-5-88\". The single \"Untitled\" was released commercially to coincide with the farewell show.\nPost-breakup: 2001\u20132004.\nIn 2001 the compilation \"Rotten Apples\" was released. The double-disc version of the album, released as a limited edition, included a collection of B-sides and rarities called \"Judas O\". The \"Greatest Hits Video Collection\" DVD was also released at the same time. This was a compilation of all of the Pumpkins promo videos from \"Gish\" to \"Machina\" along with unreleased material. \"Vieuphoria\" was released on DVD in 2002, as was the soundtrack album \"Earphoria\", previously released solely to radio stations in 1994.\nBilly Corgan and Jimmy Chamberlin reunited in 2001 as members of Corgan's next project, the short-lived supergroup Zwan. The group's only album, \"Mary Star of the Sea\", was released in 2003. After cancelling a few festival appearances, Corgan announced the demise of the band in 2003. During 2001 Corgan also toured as part of New Order and provided vocals on their comeback album \"Get Ready\". In October 2004 Corgan released his first book, \"Blinking with Fists\", a collection of poetry. In June 2005, he released a solo album, \"TheFutureEmbrace\", which he described as \"(picking) up the thread of the as-yet-unfinished work of the Smashing Pumpkins\". Despite this, it was greeted with generally mixed reviews and lackluster sales. Only one single, \"Walking Shade\", was released in support of the album.\nIn addition to drumming with Zwan, Jimmy Chamberlin also formed an alternative rock/jazz fusion project band called Jimmy Chamberlin Complex. The group released an album in 2005 titled \"Life Begins Again\". Corgan provided guest vocals on the track \"Lokicat\". James Iha served as a guitarist in A Perfect Circle, appearing on their \"Thirteenth Step\" club tour and 2004 album, \"eMOTIVe\". He has also been involved with other acts such as Chino Moreno's Team Sleep and Vanessa and the O's. He continues to work with Scratchie Records, his own record label, as well. D'arcy Wretzky has, aside from one radio interview in 2009, not made any public statements or appearances nor given any interviews since leaving the band in 1999. On January 25, 2000, she was arrested after she allegedly purchased three bags of cocaine, but after successfully completing a court-ordered drug education program, the charges were dropped.\nCorgan insisted during this period that the band would not reform, although when Zwan broke up he announced, \"I think my heart was in Smashing Pumpkins [...] I think it was naive of me to think that I could find something that would mean as much to me.\" Corgan said in 2005, \"I never wanted to leave the Smashing Pumpkins. That was never the plan.\" On February 17, 2004, Corgan posted a message on his personal blog calling Wretzky a \"mean-spirited drug addict\" and blaming Iha for the breakup of the Smashing Pumpkins. On June 3, 2004, he added that \"the depth of my hurt [from Iha] is only matched with the depth of my gratitude\". Iha responded to Corgan's claims in 2005, saying, \"No, I didn't break up the band. The only person who could have done that is Billy.\"\nReformation and \"Zeitgeist\": 2005\u20132008.\nOn June 21, 2005, the day of the release of his first solo album \"TheFutureEmbrace\", Corgan took out full-page advertisements in the \"Chicago Tribune\" and \"Chicago Sun-Times\" to announce that he planned to reunite the band. \"For a year now\", Corgan wrote, \"I have walked around with a secret, a secret I chose to keep. But now I want you to be among the first to know that I have made plans to renew and revive the Smashing Pumpkins. I want my band back, and my songs, and my dreams\". Corgan and Chamberlin were verified as participants in the reunion, but there was question as to whether other former members of the band would participate.\nIn April 2007 Iha and Auf der Maur separately confirmed that they were not taking part in the reunion. Chamberlin would later state that Iha and Wretzky \"didn't want to be a part of\" the reunion. The Smashing Pumpkins performed live for the first time since 2000 on May 22, 2007, in Paris, France. There, the band unveiled new touring members: guitarist Jeff Schroeder, bassist Ginger Reyes, and keyboardist Lisa Harriton. That same month, \"Tarantula\" was released as the first single from the band's forthcoming album. On July 7, the band performed at the Live Earth concert in New Jersey.\nThe band's new album, \"Zeitgeist\", was released that same month on Reprise Records, entering the \"Billboard\" charts at number two and selling 145,000 copies in its first week. \"Zeitgeist\" received mixed reviews, with much of the criticism targeted at the absence of half of the original lineup. The album divided the Pumpkins' fanbase. Corgan would later admit, \"I know a lot of our fans are puzzled by \"Zeitgeist\". I think they wanted this massive, grandiose work, but you don't just roll out of bed after seven years without a functioning band and go back to doing that\".\nCorgan and Chamberlin continued to record as a duo, releasing the four-song EP \"American Gothic\" in January 2008 and the singles \"Superchrist\" and \"G.L.O.W.\" later that year. That November, the group released the DVD \"If All Goes Wrong\", which chronicled the group's 2007 concert residences in Asheville, North Carolina and San Francisco, California. In late 2008, the band commenced on a controversy-riddled 20th Anniversary Tour. Around this time, Corgan said the group will make no more full-length records in order to focus exclusively on singles, explaining, \"The listening patterns have changed, so why are we killing ourselves to do albums, to create balance, and do the arty track to set up the single? It's done.\"\n\"Teargarden\" and \"Oceania\": 2009\u20132013.\nIn March 2009 Corgan announced on the band's website that Chamberlin had left the group and would be replaced. Chamberlin subsequently stated that his departure from the band was \"a positive move forward for me. I can no longer commit all of my energy into something that I don't fully possess.\" Chamberlin stressed that the split was amicable, commenting, \"I am glad [Corgan] has chosen to continue under the name. It is his right.\"\nChamberlin soon formed the band Skysaw, which released an album and toured in support of Minus the Bear. In July 2009, Corgan formed a new group called Spirits in the Sky, initially as a tribute band to Sky Saxon of the Seeds, who had recently died. The following month, Corgan confirmed on the band's website that 19-year-old Spirits in the Sky drummer Mike Byrne had replaced Chamberlin and that the pair were working on new Pumpkins recordings.\nThe group announced plans to release a 44-track concept album, \"Teargarden by Kaleidyscope\", for free over the Internet one track at a time. The first track, \"A Song for a Son\", was released in December 2009 to moderate press acclaim. In March 2010 Ginger Reyes officially left the band, prompting an open call for auditions for a new bassist. That month also saw the first EP, \"Vol. 1: Songs for a Sailor\", released from the project as a box set. In May, Nicole Fiorentino announced she had joined the band as bass player, and would be working on \"Teargarden by Kaleidyscope\". The new lineup went on a world tour through to the end of 2010. One of the first shows with the new lineup was a concert to benefit Matthew Leone, bassist for the rock band Madina Lake, at the Metro on July 27, 2010. In late 2010 the second EP, \"Vol. 2: The Solstice Bare\", was released as another box set, and all four members contributed to the sessions for the third volume of \"Teargarden\", which was ultimately canceled after the completion of two stand-alone songs.\nOn April 26, 2011, Corgan announced that the Smashing Pumpkins would be releasing a new album titled \"Oceania\", which he labeled as \"an album within an album\" in regards to the \"Teargarden by Kaleidyscope\" project, in the fall. As with the previous recording sessions, all four band members contributed to the project. Also, the entire album catalog was to be remastered and reissued with bonus tracks, starting with \"Gish\" and \"Siamese Dream\" in November 2011. The pre-\"Gish\" demos, \"Pisces Iscariot\", and \"Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness\" were released in 2012, with \"The Aeroplane Flies High\" released the following year. \"Adore\" was released in 2014. \"Machina/The Machines of God\" and the yet commercially unreleased \"Machina II/Friends and Enemies of Modern Music\" were expected to be combined, remixed, and released in the same year but were not released due to label hang-ups. The band did a thirteen-city US tour in October 2011 followed by a European tour in November and December.\n\"Oceania\" was released on June 19, 2012, and received generally positive reviews. The album debuted at No.\u00a04 on the Billboard 200 and at No.\u00a01 on the Billboard Independent. The album spawned two singles, \"The Celestials\" and \"Panopticon\". The band proceeded to tour in support of the album, including a US tour involving playing the album in its entirety. By September 2012, Corgan stated that the band had already begun work on their next album. However, despite this, the band concentrated on touring, playing at Glastonbury Festival, Dour Festival and the Barclays Center, where they recorded \"\", which was released on September 24, 2013.\n\"Monuments to an Elegy\": 2014\u20132016.\nOn March 25, 2014, Corgan announced he had signed a new record deal with BMG, for two new albums, titled \"Monuments to an Elegy\" and \"Day for Night\", respectively. In June, it was revealed that Mike Byrne was no longer in the band, to be replaced by Tommy Lee of M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce on the new album, and Fiorentino would not be recording on the album either. \"Monuments to an Elegy\" was released on December 5, 2014, to generally positive reviews. The band toured in support of the album starting on November 26, with Rage Against the Machine's Brad Wilk filling in on drums and the Killers' Mark Stoermer filling in on bass. The follow-up proposed album \"Day For Night\" was cited for delayed late 2015 or early 2016 release.\nLater in 2015 Corgan announced that the band would embark on a co-headlining tour of North America with Marilyn Manson, \"The End Times Tour\", across July and August 2015. Prior to the co-headlining dates, the band performed a series of acoustic shows with drum machines and tapes for percussion. When the time came for the co-headlining tour, plans for a drummer fell through and Corgan recruited Chamberlin to reunite for the shows. On February 25, 2016, Corgan posted a video from a Los Angeles studio on the band's Facebook account, giving an update on the writing process for the new songs for the upcoming album to be released after the \"In Plainsong\" tour.\nThe tour began in Portland, Oregon, on March 22, 2016.\nIha and Chamberlin's return; \"Shiny and Oh So Bright\" and \"Cyr\": 2018\u20132021.\nOn his birthday on March 26, 2016, original guitarist James Iha joined Billy Corgan, Jimmy Chamberlin, and Jeff Schroeder on stage unannounced at the Ace Hotel in downtown Los Angeles. He performed a few songs, including \"Mayonaise\", \"Soma\" and \"Today\" marking his first appearance with the Smashing Pumpkins in 16 years. Iha also played at the second of the two Smashing Pumpkins shows at the Ace Hotel the following day, which was Easter Sunday. Iha joined the Pumpkins for a third time at their concert of April 14 at the Civic Opera House in Chicago. In July, Corgan began hinting of the possibility of reuniting the band original lineup, of himself, Iha, Wretzky, and Chamberlin, and in August, he stated he had begun reaching out to the original lineup about the feasibility of a reunion, including speaking to Wretzky for the first time in sixteen years. Despite the comments, Corgan would spend much of 2017 working on solo material \u2013 recording and releasing the solo album \"Ogilala\" and beginning work on another solo album for 2018. In June 2017 Chamberlin also mentioned the possibility of a reunion tour in 2018. In January 2018 Corgan shared a photo of himself, Iha, and Chamberlin together in recording studio. In February 2018 Corgan announced that he was working with music producer Rick Rubin on a future Smashing Pumpkins album, that there were currently 26 songs he was actively working on, and that \"the guitar feels once again like the preferred weapon of choice.\" Soon afterwards, Corgan shared a photo of sound equipment with Iha's name on a label, as well as announcing recording was finished on the album.\nOn February 15, 2018, founding members Iha and Chamberlin rejoined the band. They embarked on the Shiny And Oh So Bright Tour starting in July, with a focus on performing material from their first five studio albums. and sold over 350,000 tickets and sold-out arenas including The Forum, United Center, and Madison Square Garden. Original bassist D'arcy Wretzky claimed she had been offered a contract to rejoin the band but Corgan rescinded the offer soon after. Corgan released a statement denying the claims, stating \"Ms. Wretzky has repeatedly been invited out to play with the group, participate in demo sessions, or at the very least, meet face-to-face, and in each and every instance she always deferred\". Jack Bates (son of Joy Division bassist Peter Hook) played bass on the tour. Bates previously toured with the Smashing Pumpkins in 2015. Multi-instrumentalist Katie Cole rejoined the band for the tour as well, singing backup vocals and playing keyboards and guitar.\nIn March 2018, Corgan mentioned the band planned to release two EPs in 2018, with the first tentatively planned for May. On June 8, 2018, the first single from the set of music, \"Solara\", was released. On August 2, 2018, the band celebrated their 30th anniversary by performing in Holmdel, New Jersey. with several notable special guests including Courtney Love, Chino Moreno, Davey Havok, Peter Hook, Mark McGrath, and Dave Keuning and Mark Stoermer of the Killers. In September 2018, they announced the album \"\", released via Napalm Records on November 16, 2018, which debuted at number 54 on the Billboard 200 chart.\nAfter touring through much of 2019, Corgan noted in January 2020 that the band was currently working on 21 songs for a future album release. On August 28, 2020, the band released the single and video for \"Cyr\", along with a second track titled \"The Colour of Love\" from their album \"Cyr\", which was released through their new record label Sumerian Records on November 27, 2020. It serves as the second part of the \"Shiny and Oh So Bright\" series. On September 25, 2020, the band released another single from \"Cyr\" that included the songs \"Confessions of a Dopamine Addict\" and \"Wrath\". On October 9, 2020, the band released a third single for \"Cyr\" that featured the tracks \"Anno Satana\" and \"Birch Grove\". On October 29, the band released \"Ramona\" and \"Wyttch\" as the fourth pair of singles. On November 20, 2020, the songs \"Purple Blood\" and \"Dulcet in E\" were released as the fifth and final single for \"Cyr.\" The following week, on November 27, 2020, the band released \"Cyr.\"\n\"Atum: A Rock Opera in Three Acts\" and \"Aghori Mhori Mei\": 2022\u2013present.\nIn late 2020, Corgan announced that the band had begun work on a double album to serve as a sequel to the overarching story of \"Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness\" and \"Machina: The Machines of God.\" The album was planned for release in 2021, however it wasn't until September 19, 2022, that the album's title, \"\", was revealed. Each act was released on its own, with the dates in order being November 15, 2022, January 31, 2023, and May 5, 2023. All of the acts, along with ten extra songs, were compiled into a vinyl box set that was released the same day as the third grouping of songs. On February 22, 2022, the band announced on social media the Rock Invasion 2 Tour, which had previously been set to take place in spring 2020, postponed to fall 2020, and subsequently canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The newly announced incarnation of the tour had entirely new locations spanning eleven US cities accompanying the band's spring festival appearances, and four performances in Mexico, their first since 2013.\nIn May 2022, the band announced plans for the Spirits on Fire tour with Jane's Addiction. In November 2022, The World is A Vampire Festival was announced for March 2023. The festival's lineup included Interpol, Turnstile, Peter Hook &amp; The Light, Deafheaven, the Warning, and several others. In February 2023, the band announced that they would be bringing The World Is A Vampire Festival to Australia as a 10-date tour during the month of April. The lineup featured Jane's Addiction, Amyl &amp; The Sniffers, Redhook, and Battlesnake, in addition to the wrestling matches similar to the singular date in Mexico. In between the band's time in Mexico and Australia, they announced on March 28, 2023, that they would bring The World Is A Vampire to the United States and Canada as a summer tour across amphitheaters, indoor theaters, and one arena. The tour featured support from Stone Temple Pilots, Interpol, and Rival Sons, as well as select appearances by Corgan's National Wrestling Alliance (NWA) wrestlers along with tapings for \"NWA Powerrr\".\nOn October 19, 2023, Green Day played a small club show and handed out physical flyers that revealed in 2024 they would be touring the United States and Canada in stadiums with the Smashing Pumpkins, Rancid, and the Linda Lindas. This tour was officially announced by all four bands on November 2, 2023, as The Saviors Tour. On October 24, 2023, it was announced in a statement posted on the band's social media that longtime guitarist Jeff Schroeder had decided to leave the band \"to explore a slightly different path\".\nFollowing Schroeder's departure, on January 5, 2024, Smashing Pumpkins announced via their social media channels that they were accepting applications via email for an additional guitarist. By January 17, the band had received over 10,000 submissions and employed eight people full-time to review each one. On April 26, the band announced that they had chosen Kiki Wong as their new touring guitarist, with Billy Corgan noting that he was a fan of hers \"before she submitted her name to be considered.\"\nIn June 2024, Smashing Pumpkins performed a six-city tour of the United Kingdom and Ireland, which they co-headlined with Weezer. That same month, Corgan stated that the band had been spending the last 2 years working on a guitar-driven new studio album, partially in response to the negative reception of the emphasis of synthesizers on the \"Atum\" releases. The following month, the band announced their thirteenth album, \"Aghori Mhori Mei\", would be released on August 2. The album would be released digitally first, before physical editions followed later. An outtake, \"Chrome Jets\", was released as a standalone single in September 2025.\nOn June 27, 2025, it was announced that a reissue of the band\u2019s \"Machina\" albums would be taking place. A fully remastered version of \"Machina/The Machines of God\" was released on August 22, 2025, on physical formats and streaming. In October, the band released \"\", which will contain 80 songs across eight records. The originally envisioned \"Machina\" concept album will consist of the first 48 songs, and the other 32 are various bonus tracks consisting of demos, outtakes, and live tracks.\nMusical style, influences, and legacy.\nThe Smashing Pumpkins' music has explored alternative rock, grunge, psychedelic rock, heavy metal, shoegaze, synth-pop, art rock, electronic rock, gothic rock, dream pop, psychedelia, college rock, punk rock, and progressive rock. According to drummer Jimmy Chamberlin, when Smashing Pumpkins first formed, each member had their own set of influences, few of which were shared by the whole band:At the beginning, [there were few common influences]. I came from a jazz background, my influences were Tony Williams, Jeff Beck, Return to Forever, Weather Report. Billy was very much into Joy Division, New Order, Bauhaus, but also was a closet Mahavishnu fan, and really liked that Yngwie Malmsteen stuff, progressive rock. James Iha was really into Johnny Marr, and D\u2019arcy had her own trip as well.Since those early days, the direction of the Smashing Pumpkins has been dominated by lead guitarist, lead vocalist, keyboardist, bassist and primary songwriter Billy Corgan, who has been the band's sole constant member since its inception. Journalist Greg Kot wrote, \"The music [of the Smashing Pumpkins] would not be what it is without his ambition and vision, and his famously fractured relationships with his family, friends, and bandmembers.\" Melissa Auf der Maur commented upon news of the group's reunion, \"Everyone knows Billy doesn't need too many people to make a Pumpkins record, other than Jimmy [Chamberlin]\u2014who he has on board.\" In a 2015 interview, Corgan himself referred to the current iteration of the band as \"sort of an open source collective\", noting that \"[i]t's whoever feels right at the time.\" Many of Corgan's lyrics for the Pumpkins are cathartic expressions of emotion, full of personal musings and strong indictments of himself and those close to him. Music critics were not often fans of Corgan's angst-filled lyrics. Jim DeRogatis wrote in a 1993 \"Chicago Sun-Times\" article that Corgan's lyrics \"too often sound like sophomoric poetry\", although he viewed the lyrics of later albums \"Adore\" and \"Machina\" as an improvement. The band's songs have been described as \"anguished, bruised reports from Billy Corgan's nightmare-land\" by journalist William Shaw.\nThe band's distinctive sound up until \"Adore\" involved layering numerous guitar tracks onto a song during the recording process, a tactic that \"Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness\" co-producer Flood called the \"Pumpkin guitar overdub army.\" Although there were a lot of overdubbed parts on \"Gish\", Corgan began to really explore the possibilities of overdubbing with \"Siamese Dream\"; Corgan has stated that \"Soma\" alone contains up to 40 overdubbed guitar parts. While Corgan knew many of the songs would be difficult or impossible to replicate from their recorded versions in concert (in fact, some songs were drastically altered for live performance), he has explained the use of overdubbing by posing the question \"When you are faced with making a permanent recorded representation of a song, why not endow it with the grandest possible vision?\" This use of multilayered sounds was inspired by Corgan's love of 1970s popular artists and bands such as David Bowie, Cheap Trick, Queen, Boston, and the Electric Light Orchestra, as well as shoegaze, a British alternative rock style of the late 1980s and early 1990s that relied on swirling layers of guitar noise for effect. \"Mellon Collie\" coproducer Alan Moulder was originally hired to mix \"Siamese Dream\" because Corgan was a fan of his work producing shoegaze bands such as My Bloody Valentine, Ride, and Slowdive.\nLike many contemporary alternative bands, the Smashing Pumpkins utilized shifts in song dynamics, going from quiet to loud and vice versa. H\u00fcsker D\u00fc's seminal album \"Zen Arcade\" demonstrated to the band how they could place gentler material against more aggressive fare, and Corgan made such shifts in dynamics central to the pursuit of his grand musical ambitions. Corgan said he liked the idea of creating his own alternative universe through sound that essentially tells the listener, \"Welcome to Pumpkin Land, this is what it sounds like on Planet Pumpkin.\" This emphasis on atmosphere carried through to \"Adore\" (described as \"arcane night music\" in prerelease promotion) and the \"Machina\" albums (concept records that tell the story of a fictional rock band).\nThe Pumpkins drew inspiration from a variety of other genres, some unfashionable during the 1990s among music critics. Corgan in particular was open about his appreciation of heavy metal, citing Dimebag Darrell of Pantera as his favorite contemporary guitarist. When one interviewer commented to Corgan and Iha that \"Smashing Pumpkins is one of the groups that relegitimized heavy metal\" and that they \"were among the first alternative rockers to mention people like Ozzy and Black Sabbath with anything other than contempt\", Corgan went on to rave about Black Sabbath's \"Master of Reality\" and Judas Priest's \"Unleashed in the East\". The song \"Zero\", which reminded Iha of Judas Priest, is an example of what the band dubbed \"cybermetal\". Other bands Corgan cited as influences are Rainbow, Accept, Mercyful Fate, Dokken, Metallica, Slayer and Myrkur.\nPost-punk and gothic rock bands like Joy Division/New Order, Bauhaus, the Cure, and Depeche Mode were formative influences on the band, which covered such artists in concert and on record. Corgan also cited Siouxsie and the Banshees saying it was important to point back to bands that influenced them. Psychedelic rock was also referenced often in the band's early recordings; according to Corgan, \"In typical Pumpkins fashion, no one at that point really liked loud guitars or psychedelic music so, of course, that's exactly what we had to do.\" Corgan felt that the band's guitars \"are a mixture of heavy metal and 80s alternative rock. I think of Cure and Siouxsie and the Banshees\". Corgan acknowledged that a chord he jokingly claimed as \"the Pumpkin chord\" (a G# octave chord at the eleventh fret of a guitar with the low E string played under it), used as the basis for \"Cherub Rock\", \"Drown\", and other songs, was in fact previously used by Jimi Hendrix. Other early influences cited by Corgan include Cream, the Stooges, and Blue Cheer.\nRegarding the band's influence upon other groups, Greg Kot wrote in 2001, \"Whereas Nirvana spawned countless mini-Nirvanas, the Pumpkins remain an island unto themselves.\" Still, several artists and bands have considered the Pumpkins as an influence, such as Nelly Furtado, Marilyn Manson, Deftones, Evanescence, Third Eye Blind, Mark Hoppus of Blink-182, Tegan and Sara, Fall Out Boy, Rivers Cuomo, M83, Panic! at the Disco, Silversun Pickups, Vision Eternel, My Chemical Romance, and Code Orange. My Chemical Romance vocalist Gerard Way has said that they pattern their career upon the Pumpkins', including music videos. The members of fellow Chicago band Kill Hannah are friends with Corgan, and lead singer Mat Devine has compared his group to the Pumpkins.\nThe group has sold over 30\u00a0million albums worldwide as of October 2012, and sales in the United States alone reaching 19.75\u00a0million. \"Siamese Dream\" and \"Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness\" have both appeared in \"Rolling Stone\" magazine's list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time.\nMusic videos.\nThe Smashing Pumpkins have been praised as \"responsible for some of the most striking and memorable video clips\" and for having \"approached videos from a completely artistic standpoint rather than mere commercials to sell albums\". MTV's 2001 anniversary special \"Testimony: 20\u00a0Years of Rock on MTV\" credited the Pumpkins, along with Nine Inch Nails, with treating music videos as an art form during the 1990s. Corgan has said, \"We generally resisted the idea of what I call the classic MTV rock video, which is like lots of people jumping around and stuff.\" The band worked with video directors including Kevin Kerslake (\"Cherub Rock\"), Samuel Bayer (\"Bullet with Butterfly Wings\"), and, most frequently, the team of Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris (\"Rocket\", \"1979\", \"Tonight, Tonight\", \"The End Is the Beginning Is the End\", and \"Perfect\"). Corgan, who was frequently heavily involved in the conception of the videos, said of Dayton and Faris, \"I know my [initial] versions are always darker, and they're always talking me into something a little kinder and gentler.\" Videos like \"Today\", \"Rocket\", and \"1979\" dealt with images taken from middle American culture, albeit exaggerated. The group's videos so often avoid the literal interpretation of the song lyrics that the video for \"Thirty-Three\", with images closely related to the words of the song, was created as an intentional stylistic departure.\nThe band was nominated for several MTV Video Music Awards during the 1990s. In 1996, the group won eight VMAs total for the \"1979\" and \"Tonight, Tonight\" videos, including the top award, Video of the Year, for \"Tonight, Tonight\". The video was also nominated for a Grammy at the 1997 ceremony. Of the \"Tonight, Tonight\" video, Corgan remarked, \"I don't think we've ever had people react [like this]... it just seemed to touch a nerve.\"\nShortly after the band's 2000 breakup, the \"Greatest Hits Video Collection\" was released, collecting the band's music videos from 1991 to 2000 and including commentary from Corgan, Iha, Chamberlin, Wretzky, and various music video directors with outtakes, live performances, and the extended \"Try, Try, Try\" short film.\nBand members.\nCurrent members\nCurrent touring musicians\nFormer members\nAwards.\nAmerican Music Awards\nGrammy Awards\nMTV Europe Music Awards\nMTV Video Music Awards\nDiscography.\nNotes.\n\u2020 Reworked as \"\" (2025), a box set combining and restructuring both \"Machina\" albums into a single album with additional tracks.\n\u2021 Part of \"Teargarden by Kaleidyscope\" (2009\u20132014), an overarching project abandoned before completion.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "31468", "revid": "3341545", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31468", "title": "Thomas Robert Malthus", "text": "British political economist (1766\u20131834)\nThomas Robert Malthus (; 13/14 February 1766 \u2013 29 December 1834) was an English economist, cleric, and scholar influential in the fields of political economy and demography.\nIn his 1798 book \"An Essay on the Principle of Population\", Malthus observed that an increase in a nation's food production improved the well-being of the population, but the improvement was temporary because it led to population growth, which in turn restored the original per capita production level. In other words, humans had a propensity to use abundance for population growth rather than for maintaining a high standard of living, a view and stance that has become known as the \"Malthusian trap\" or the \"Malthusian spectre\". Populations had a tendency to grow until the lower class suffered hardship, want, and greater susceptibility to war, famine, and disease, a pessimistic view that is sometimes referred to as a Malthusian catastrophe. Malthus wrote in opposition to the popular view in 18th-century Europe that saw society as improving and in principle as perfectible.\nMalthus considered population growth as inevitable whenever conditions improved, thereby precluding real progress towards a utopian society: \"The power of population is indefinitely greater than the power in the earth to produce subsistence for man.\" As an Anglican cleric, he saw this situation as divinely imposed to teach virtuous behavior. Malthus wrote that \"the increase of population is necessarily limited by subsistence\", \"population does invariably increase when the means of subsistence increase\", and \"the superior power of population repress by moral restraint, vice, and misery.\"\nMalthus criticised the Poor Laws for leading to inflation rather than improving the well-being of the poor. He supported taxes on grain imports (the Corn Laws). His views became influential and controversial across economic, political, social and scientific thought. Pioneers of evolutionary biology read him, notably Charles Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace. Presidents Thomas Jefferson and James Madison read Malthus. Malthus's failure to predict the Industrial Revolution was a frequent criticism of his theories. Malthus laid the \"theoretical foundation of the conventional wisdom that has dominated the debate, both scientifically and ideologically, on global hunger and famines for almost two centuries.\"\nEarly life and education.\nThomas Robert Malthus was the sixth of seven children of Daniel Malthus and Henrietta Catherine, daughter of Daniel Graham, apothecary to kings George II and George III, and granddaughter of Thomas Graham, apothecary to kings George I and George II. Henrietta was depicted alongside her siblings in William Hogarth's painting, \"The Graham Children\" (1742). Malthus was born at The Rookery, a \"small elegant mansion\" at Westcott, near Dorking in Surrey, which his father had bought\u2014at that time called Chertgate Farm\u2014and converted into \"a gentleman's seat\"; the family sold it in 1768 and moved to \"a less extensive establishment at Albury, not far from Guildford\". Malthus had a cleft lip and palate which affected his speech; such birth defects had occurred in previous generations of his family. His friend, the social theorist Harriet Martineau, who was hard of hearing, nevertheless stated that due to his sonorous voice he was the only person she could hear well without her ear trumpet. William Petersen and John Maynard Keynes describe Daniel Malthus as \"a gentleman of good family and independent means [...] [and] a friend of David Hume and Jean-Jacques Rousseau\". Daniel Malthus was son of Sydenham Malthus, who was a clerk of Chancery and director of the South Sea Company; he was also \"proprietor of several landed properties in the Home Counties and Cambridgeshire\". Sydenham Malthus's father, Daniel, had been apothecary to King William and later to Queen Anne; Daniel's father, Rev. Robert Malthus, was appointed vicar of Northolt, Middlesex (now West London) under the regicide Cromwell, but \"evicted at the Restoration\"; he was described as \"an ancient divine, a man of strong reason, and mighty in the Scriptures, of great eloquence and fervour, though defective in elocution\", due to \"a very great impediment in his utterance\" which has been concluded to be likely to have been a cleft palate. The young Malthus received his education at the Warrington Academy from 1782, where he was taught by Gilbert Wakefield. Warrington was a dissenting academy, which closed in 1783. Malthus continued for a period to be tutored by Wakefield at the latter's home in Bramcote, Nottinghamshire.\nMalthus entered Jesus College, Cambridge, in 1784. While there, he took prizes in English declamation, Latin and Greek, and graduated with honours, Ninth Wrangler in mathematics. His tutor was William Frend. He took the MA degree in 1791, and was elected a Fellow of Jesus College two years later. In 1789, he took orders in the Church of England, and became a curate at Oakwood Chapel (also Okewood) in the parish of Wotton, Surrey.\nPopulation growth.\nMalthus came to prominence for his 1798 publication, \"An Essay on the Principle of Population\". He wrote the original text in reaction to the optimism of his father and his father's associates (notably Jean-Jacques Rousseau) regarding the future improvement of society. He also constructed his case as a specific response to writings of William Godwin and of the Marquis de Condorcet (1743\u20131794). His assertions evoked questions and criticism, and between 1798 and 1826 he published six more versions of \"An Essay on the Principle of Population\", updating each edition to incorporate new material, to address criticism, and to convey changes in his own perspectives on the subject.\nThe Malthusian controversy to which the \"Essay\" gave rise in the decades following its publication tended to focus attention on the birth rate and marriage rates. The neo-Malthusian controversy, comprising related debates of many years later, has seen a similar central role assigned to the numbers of children born.\nThe goal of Malthusian theory is to explain how population and food production expand, with the latter experiencing arithmetic growth and the former experiencing exponential growth. The controversy, however, concerns the relevance of Malthusian theory in the present world. This hypothesis is inapplicable in a number of ways. First, the hypothesis is rendered irrelevant, due to a disregard for technological advancement. This is because food production has increased as a result of technological advancements such as genetically modified organisms (GMOs). Second, the mathematical model employed to formulate the hypothesis is incorrect since it was constrained to England's specific situation. Other findings, such as food production exceeding population increase, may be borne out if the modeling could employ wide locations like Australia. The Malthusian hypothesis is also limited by social change about family size, as individuals tend to prefer a manageable family owing to economic restrictions.\nFood production can also outpace population expansion, due to the industrial revolution. Another limitation of this theory is the belief that overall income is a key factor of population health, implying that wealthy countries will have various solutions for their rapidly rising populations. An expanding population can be considered as an increase of available human capacity for increasing food production. The static aspect of the Malthusian hypothesis, which is based on the rule of decreasing returns, limits its applicability. Finally, Malthusian Theory's failure to determine whether birth rates match death rates hampered its application, because it was possible that the population was not rising as fast as food production due to the presence of deaths.\nTravel and further career.\nIn 1799, Malthus made a European tour with William Otter, a close college friend, travelling part of the way with Edward Daniel Clarke and John Marten Cripps, visiting Germany, Scandinavia and Russia. Malthus used the tour to gather population data. Otter later wrote a \"Memoir\" of Malthus for the second (1836) edition of his \"Principles of Political Economy\". During the Peace of Amiens of 1802 he travelled to France and Switzerland, in a party that included his relation and future wife Harriet.\nIn 1803, he became rector of Walesby, Lincolnshire.\nIn 1805, Malthus became Professor of History and Political Economy at the East India Company College in Hertfordshire. His students affectionately referred to him as \"Pop\", \"Population\", or \"web-toe\" Malthus.\nNear the end of 1817, the proposed appointment of Graves Champney Haughton to the college was made a pretext by Randle Jackson and Joseph Hume to launch an attempt to close it down. Malthus wrote a pamphlet defending the college, which was reprieved by the East India Company within the same year, 1817.\nIn 1818, Malthus became a Fellow of the Royal Society.\nMalthus\u2013Ricardo debate on political economy.\nDuring the 1820s, a setpiece intellectual discussion took place among the exponents of political economy, often called the Malthus\u2013Ricardo debate after its leading figures, Malthus and theorist of free trade David Ricardo, both of whom had written books with the title \"Principles of Political Economy\". Under examination were the nature and methods of political economy itself, while it was simultaneously under attack from others. The roots of the debate were in the previous decade. In \"The Nature of Rent\" (1815), Malthus had dealt with economic rent, a major concept in classical economics. Ricardo defined a theory of rent in his \"Principles of Political Economy and Taxation\" (1817): he regarded rent as value in excess of real production\u2014something caused by ownership rather than by free trade. Rent therefore represented a kind of negative money that landlords could pull out of the production of the land, by means of its scarcity. Contrary to this concept, Malthus proposed rent to be a kind of economic surplus.\nThe debate developed over the economic concept of a general glut, and the possibility of failure of Say's law. Malthus laid importance on economic development and the persistence of disequilibrium. The context was the post-war depression; Malthus had a supporter in William Blake, in denying that capital accumulation (saving) was always good in such circumstances, and John Stuart Mill attacked Blake on the fringes of the debate.\nRicardo corresponded with Malthus from 1817 about his \"Principles\". He was drawn into considering political economy in a less restricted sense, which might be adapted to legislation and its multiple objectives, by the thought of Malthus. In \"Principles of Political Economy\" (1820) and elsewhere, Malthus addressed the tension, amounting to conflict he saw between a narrow view of political economy and the broader moral and political plane. Leslie Stephen wrote:\nIf Malthus and Ricardo differed, it was a difference of men who accepted the same first principles. They both professed to interpret Adam Smith as the true prophet, and represented different shades of opinion rather than diverging sects.\nIt is now considered that the different purposes seen by Malthus and Ricardo for political economy affected their technical discussion, and contributed to the lack of compatible definitions. For example, Jean-Baptiste Say used a definition of production based on goods and services and so queried the restriction of Malthus to \"goods\" alone.\nIn terms of public policy, Malthus was a supporter of the protectionist Corn Laws from the end of the Napoleonic Wars. He emerged as the only economist of note to support duties on imported grain. By encouraging domestic production, Malthus argued, the Corn Laws would guarantee British self-sufficiency in food.\nLater life.\nMalthus was a founding member in 1821 of the Political Economy Club, where John Cazenove tended to be his ally against Ricardo and Mill. He was elected in the beginning of 1824 as one of the ten royal associates of the Royal Society of Literature. He was also one of the first fellows of the Statistical Society, founded in March 1834. In 1827 he gave evidence to a committee of the House of Commons on emigration.\nIn 1827, he published \"Definitions in Political Economy\" The first chapter put forth \"Rules for the Definition and Application of Terms in Political Economy\". In chapter 10, the penultimate chapter, he presented 60 numbered paragraphs putting forth terms and their definitions that he proposed should be used in discussing political economy following those rules. This collection of terms and definitions is remarkable for two reasons: first, Malthus was the first economist to explicitly organize, define, and publish his terms as a coherent glossary of defined terms; and second, his definitions were for the most part well-formed definitional statements. Between these chapters, he criticised several contemporary economists\u2014Jean-Baptiste Say, David Ricardo, James Mill, John Ramsay McCulloch, and Samuel Bailey\u2014for sloppiness in choosing, attaching meaning to, and using their technical terms.\nMcCulloch was the editor of \"The Scotsman\" of Edinburgh and replied cuttingly in a review printed on the front page of his newspaper in March 1827. He implied that Malthus wanted to dictate terms and theories to other economists. McCulloch clearly took personal offence and his review of \"Definitions\" is largely a bitter defence of his own \"Principles of Political Economy\", and his counter-attack \"does little credit to his reputation\", being largely \"personal derogation\" of Malthus. The purpose of Malthus's \"Definitions\" was terminological clarity, and Malthus discussed appropriate terms, their definitions, and their use by himself and his contemporaries. This motivation of Malthus's work was disregarded by McCulloch, who responded that there was nothing to be gained \"by carping at definitions, and quibbling about the meaning to be attached to\" words. Given that statement, it is not surprising that McCulloch's review failed to address the rules of chapter 1 and did not discuss the definitions of chapter 10; he also barely mentioned Malthus's critiques of other writers.\nIn spite of this and in the wake of McCulloch's scathing review, the reputation of Malthus as economist dropped away for the rest of his life. On the other hand, Malthus did have supporters, including Thomas Chalmers, some of the Oriel Noetics, Richard Jones and William Whewell from Cambridge.\nMalthus died suddenly of heart disease on 29 December 1834 at his father-in-law's house. He was buried in Bath Abbey. His portrait, and descriptions by contemporaries, present him as tall and good-looking, but with a cleft lip and palate.\nFamily.\nOn 13 March 1804, Thomas Malthus married Harriet Eckersall, the eldest daughter of his first cousins John and Catherine Eckersall, who lived near Bath. Harriet became well-known at Haileybury College for hosting gatherings of notable scientists; eleven years younger than Thomas, she survived him by thirty years, remarrying after his death.\nThe couple had a son, Henry, and two daughters, Emily and Lucille. Henry, the eldest, became vicar of Effingham, Surrey in 1835 and of Donnington, Sussex in 1837; he married Sofia Otter, daughter of Bishop William Otter and died in August 1882, aged 76. Emily, the middle child, died in 1885, outliving her parents and siblings. Lucille, the youngest, died unmarried and childless in 1825, at age 17.\n\"An Essay on the Principle of Population\".\nMalthus argued in his \"Essay\" (1798) that population growth generally expanded in times and in regions of plenty until the size of the population relative to the primary resources caused distress:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Yet in all societies, even those that are most vicious, the tendency to a virtuous attachment [i.e., marriage] is so strong that there is a constant effort towards an increase of population. This constant effort as constantly tends to subject the lower classes of the society to distress and to prevent any great permanent amelioration of their condition.\u2014\u200a\nMalthus argued that two types of checks hold population within resource limits: \"positive\" checks, which raise the death rate; and \"preventive\" ones, which lower the birth rate. The positive checks include hunger, disease and war; the preventive checks: birth control, postponement of marriage and celibacy.\nThe rapid increase in the global population of the past century exemplifies Malthus's predicted population patterns; it also appears to describe socio-demographic dynamics of complex pre-industrial societies. These findings are the basis for neo-Malthusian modern mathematical models of \"long-term historical dynamics\".\nMalthus wrote that in a period of resource abundance, a population could double in 25 years. However, the margin of abundance could not be sustained as population grew, leading to checks on population growth:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;If the subsistence for man that the earth affords was to be increased every twenty-five years by a quantity equal to what the whole world at present produces, this would allow the power of production in the earth to be absolutely unlimited, and its ratio of increase much greater than we can conceive that any possible exertions of mankind could make it ... yet still the power of population being a power of a superior order, the increase of the human species can only be kept commensurate to the increase of the means of subsistence by the constant operation of the strong law of necessity acting as a check upon the greater power.\u2014\u200aIn later editions of his essay, Malthus clarified his view that if society relied on human misery to limit population growth, then sources of misery (\"e.g.\", hunger, disease, and war) would inevitably afflict society, as would volatile economic cycles. On the other hand, \"preventive checks\" to population that limited birthrates, such as later marriages, could ensure a higher standard of living for all, while also increasing economic stability. Regarding possibilities for freeing man from these limits, Malthus argued against a variety of imaginable solutions, such as the notion that agricultural improvements could expand without limit.\nOf the relationship between population and economics, Malthus wrote that when the population of laborers grows faster than the production of food, real wages fall because the growing population causes the cost of living (\"i.e.\", the cost of food) to go up. Difficulties of raising a family eventually reduce the rate of population growth, until the falling population again leads to higher real wages.\nIn the second and subsequent editions Malthus put more emphasis on \"moral restraint\" as the best means of easing the poverty of the lower classes.\"\nThe first edition of the \"Essay on the Principle of Population\" also contained a sophisticated theory of mind which attempted to explain human behaviour. This materialist conception of mind emphasised its corporeal and irrational nature which operated according to an economy of desire. Malthus believed that innate bodily desires, passions, and impulses made demands on the organism to be satiated which in turn gave rise to the mental apparatus. He excised his theory of mind from all future editions of the \"Essay\" following accusations of materialism and atheism.\nOther works.\n1800: \"The present high price of provisions\".\nIn this work, his first published pamphlet, Malthus argues against the notion prevailing in his locale that the greed of intermediaries caused the high price of provisions. Instead, Malthus says that the high price stems from the Poor Laws, which \"increase the parish allowances in proportion to the price of corn.\" Thus, given a limited supply, the Poor Laws force up the price of daily necessities. However, he concludes by saying that in time of scarcity such Poor Laws, by raising the price of corn more evenly, actually produce a \"beneficial\" effect.\n1814: \"Observations on the effects of the Corn Laws\".\nAlthough government in Britain had regulated the prices of grain, the Corn Laws originated in 1815. At the end of the Napoleonic Wars that year, Parliament passed legislation banning the importation of foreign corn into Britain until domestic corn cost 80 shillings per quarter. The high price caused the cost of food to increase and caused distress among the working classes in the towns. It led to serious rioting in London and to the Peterloo Massacre in Manchester in 1819.\nIn this pamphlet, printed during the parliamentary discussion, Malthus tentatively supported the free-traders. He argued that given the increasing cost of growing British corn, advantages accrued from supplementing it from cheaper foreign sources.\n1820: \"Principles of political economy\".\nIn 1820 Malthus published \"Principles of Political Economy\".\n(A second edition was posthumously published in 1836.) Malthus intended this work to rival Ricardo's \"Principles\" (1817). It, and his 1827 \"Definitions in political economy\", defended Sismondi's views on \"general glut\" rather than Say's law, which in effect states \"there can be no general glut\".\nReception and influence.\nMalthus developed the theory of demand-supply mismatches that he called gluts. Discounted at the time, this theory foreshadowed later work by an admirer, John Maynard Keynes.\nThe vast bulk of continuing commentary on Malthus, however, extends and expands on the \"Malthusian controversy\" of the early 19th century. In Ireland where (writing to Ricardo in 1817) Malthus proposed that \"to give full effect to the natural resources of the country a great part of the population should be swept from the soil into large manufacturing and commercial Towns\", a comparatively early contribution was \"Observations on the population and resources of Ireland\" (1821) by the polymath and physician Whitely Stokes. Finding fault in Malthus's calculations and juxtapositions \u2013 \"the possible increase of man in America\" measured against \"the probable increase in [food] production in Great Britain\" \u2013 and insisting upon the advantages mankind derives from \"improved industry, improved conveyance, improvements in morals, government and religion\", Stokes argued that Ireland's difficulty lay not in her \"numbers\", but in indifferent government.\nEpitaph.\nThe epitaph of Malthus in Bath Abbey reads [with commas inserted for clarity]:\nSacred to the memory of the Rev THOMAS ROBERT MALTHUS, long known to the lettered world by his admirable writings on the social branches of political economy, particularly by his essay on population.\nOne of the best men and truest philosophers of any age or country, raised by native dignity of mind above the misrepresentations of the ignorant and the neglect of the great, he lived a serene and happy life devoted to the pursuit and communication of truth, supported by a calm but firm conviction of the usefulness of his labors, content with the approbation of the wise and good.\nHis writings will be a lasting monument of the extent and correctness of his understanding.\nThe spotless integrity of his principles, the equity and candour of his nature, his sweetness of temper, urbanity of manners and tenderness of heart, his benevolence and his piety are the still dearer recollections of his family and friends.\nBorn 14 February 1766 \u2013 Died 29 December 1834.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

R. R. Tolkien, the author of \"The Lord of the Rings\". Within the context of Tolkien's fictional world, the Tengwar were invented by the Elf F\u00ebanor, and used first to write the Elvish languages Quenya and Telerin. Later a great number of Tolkien's constructed languages were written using the Tengwar, including Sindarin. Tolkien used Tengwar to write English: most of Tolkien's Tengwar samples are actually in English.\nExternal history.\nPrecursors.\nThe sarati, a script developed by Tolkien in the late 1910s and described in \"Parma Eldalamberon 13\", anticipates many features of the Tengwar: vowel representation by diacritics (which is found in many Tengwar varieties); different Tengwar shapes; and a few correspondences between sound features and letter shape features (though inconsistent).\nEven closer to the Tengwar is the Valmaric script, described in \"Parma Eldalamberon 14\", which Tolkien used from about 1922 to 1925. It features many Tengwar shapes, the inherent vowel found in some Tengwar varieties, and the tables in the samples V12 and V13 show an arrangement that is very similar to one of the primary Tengwar in the classical Quenya \"mode\".\nIn his \"An Introduction to Elvish\", Jim Allan compared the Tengwar with the London merchant Francis Lodwick's 1686 \"Universal Alphabet\", both on grounds of the correspondence between shape features and sound features, and of the actual letter shapes.\nTengwar.\nThe Tengwar script was probably developed in the late 1920s or in the early 1930s. \"The Lonely Mountain Jar Inscription\", the first published Tengwar sample, dates to 1937. The full explanation of the Tengwar was published in Appendix E of \"The Lord of the Rings\" in 1955.\nThe \"Mellonath Daeron Index of Tengwar Specimina\" (DTS) lists most of the known samples of Tengwar by Tolkien. There are only a few known samples predating publication of \"The Lord of the Rings\" (many of them published posthumously):\nThe following samples presumably predate \"The Lord of the Rings\", but were not explicitly dated: \nInternal history and terminology.\nWithin the context of Tolkien's fictional world, the Tengwar were invented by the Elf F\u00ebanor in Valinor, and used first to write the Elven tongues Quenya and Telerin. According to J. R. R. Tolkien's \"The War of the Jewels\", at the time F\u00ebanor created his script, he introduced a change in terminology. He called a letter, a written representation of a spoken phoneme (), a . Previously, any letter or symbol had been called a (from 'incise'). The alphabet of R\u00famil of Tirion, on which F\u00ebanor supposedly based his own work, was known as Sarati. It later became known as \"Tengwar of R\u00famil\".\nThe plural of is , and this is the name by which F\u00ebanor's writing system became known. Since, however, in commonly used modes, an individual was equivalent to a consonant, the term in the fiction became equivalent to \"consonant sign\", and the vowel signs were known as . By loan-translation, the Tengwar became known as (singular ) in Sindarin, when they were introduced to Beleriand. The letters of the earlier alphabet native to Sindarin were called (singular , probably from 'cutting', and thus semantically analogous to Quenya ). This term was loaned into exilic Quenya as , plural .\nDescription.\nLetters.\nThe most notable characteristic of the Tengwar script is that the shapes of the letters correspond to the distinctive features of the sounds they represent. The Quenya consonant system has five places of articulation: labial, dental, palatal, velar, and glottal. The velars distinguish between plain and labialized (that is, articulated with rounded lips, or followed by a sound). Each point of articulation, and the corresponding tengwa series, has a name in the classical Quenya mode. Dental sounds are called and are represented with the Tengwar in column\u00a0I. Labial sounds are called , and represented by the column II Tengwar; velar sounds are called , represented by column III; and labialized velar sounds are called , represented by the \"Tengwar\" of column IV. Palatal sounds are called and have no tengwa series of their own, but are represented by column III letters with an added diacritic for following .\nSimilarly shaped letters reflect not only similar places of articulation, but also similar manners of articulation. In the classical Quenya mode, row 1 represents voiceless stops, row 2 voiced prenasalized stops, row 3 voiceless fricatives, row 4 voiceless prenasalized stops, row 5 nasal stops, and row 6 approximants.\nRegularly formed.\nMost letters are constructed by a combination of two basic shapes: a vertical stem (either long or short) and either one or two rounded bows (which may or may not be underscored, and may be on the left or right of the stem).\nThese principal letters are divided into four series () that correspond to the main places of articulation and into six grades () that correspond to the main manners of articulation. Both vary among modes.\nEach series is headed by the basic signs composed of a vertical stem descending below the line, and a single bow. These basic signs represent the voiceless stop consonants for that series. For the classical Quenya mode, they are , , and , and the series are named , , , and , respectively; means \"series\" in Quenya.\nIn rows of the \"general use\", there are the following correspondences between letter shapes and manners of articulation:\nIn addition to these variations of the Tengwar shapes, there is yet another variation, the use of stems that are extended both above and below the line. This shape may correspond to other consonant variations required. Except for some English abbreviations, it is not used in any of the better known Tengwar modes, but it occurs in a Quenya mode where the tengwa Parma with extended stem is used for and the tengwa Calma with extended stem is used for . The Tengwar with raised stems sometimes occur in glyph variants that look like extended stems, as seen in the inscription of the One Ring.\nAn example from the (the signs with a closed bow on the right side) in the \"general use\" of the Tengwar is:\nIn languages such as Quenya, which do not contain any voiced fricatives other than \"v\", the raised stem + doubled bow row is used for the common nasal+stop sequences (\"nt\", \"mp\", \"nk\", \"nqu\"). In such cases, the \"w\" sign in the previous paragraph is used for \"v\". In the mode of Beleriand, found on the door to Moria, the bottom is used for nasals (e.g., is used for ) and the fifth for doubled nasals ( for ).\nIrregularly formed.\nThere are additional letters that do not have regular shapes. They may represent, e.g., , , and . Their use varies considerably from mode to mode. Some aficionados have added more letters not found in Tolkien's writings for use in their modes.\ndiacritics.\nA (Quenya 'marking') is a diacritic placed above or below the tengwa. They can represent vowels, consonant doubling, or nasal sound.\nAs Tolkien explained in Appendix E of \"The Lord of the Rings\", the for vowels resemble Latin diacritics: circumflex (\u00ee) , acute (\u00ed) , dot (i) , left curl (\u0131\u0314) , and right curl (\u0131\u0313) . Long vowels, excepting , may be indicated by doubling the signs. Some languages from which is absent or in which compared to it appears sparsely, such as the Black Speech, use left curl for ; other languages swap the signs for and .\nA vowel occurring alone is drawn on the vowel carrier, which resembles dotless i (\u0131) for a short vowel or dotless j (\u0237) for a long vowel.\nModes.\nJust as with any alphabetic writing system, every specific language written in Tengwar requires a specific orthography, depending on the phonology of that language. These Tengwar orthographies are usually called \"modes\". Some modes follow pronunciation, while others follow traditional orthography.\nSome modes map the basic consonants to , , and (classical mode in chart at right), while others use them to represent , , and (general mode at right). The other main difference is in the fourth below, where those letters with raised stems and doubled bows can be either voiced fricatives, as in Sindarin (general mode at right), or nasalized stops, as in Quenya (classical mode).\n\u00d3matehtar.\nIn some modes, called (or \"vowel tehtar\") modes, the vowels are represented with diacritics called (Quenya for 'signs'; corresponding singular: , 'sign'). These modes can be considered abugidas rather than true alphabets. In some \u00f3matehtar modes, the consonant signs feature an inherent vowel.\n modes can vary in that the vowel stroke can be placed either on top of the consonant preceding it, as in Quenya, or on the consonant following, as in Sindarin, English, and the notorious Black Speech inscription on the One Ring.\nFull writing.\nIn the \"full writing\" modes, the consonants and the vowels are represented by Tengwar. Only one such mode is well known. It is called the \"mode of Beleriand\" and one can read it on the Doors of Durin.\nModes for other languages.\nSince the publication of the first official description of the Tengwar at the end of \"The Lord of the Rings\", others have created modes for other languages such as English, Spanish, German, Swedish, French, Finnish, Italian, Hungarian and Welsh. Modes have also been devised for other constructed languages; Esperanto and Lojban.\nTolkien had used multiple modes for English, including full writing and \u00f3matehtar alphabetic modes, phonetic full modes and phonetic \u00f3matehtar modes known from documents published after his death.\nEncoding schemes.\nLegacy encoding.\nThe contemporary de facto standard in the Tengwar user community maps the Tengwar characters onto the ISO 8859-1 character encoding following the example of the Tengwar typefaces by Dan Smith. This implies a major flaw: If no corresponding Tengwar font is installed, a string of nonsense characters appears.\nSince there are not enough places in ISO 8859-1's 191 codepoints for all the signs used in Tengwar orthography, certain signs are included in a \"Tengwar A\" font which also maps its characters on ISO 8859-1, overlapping with the first font.\nFor each Tengwar diacritic, there are four different codepoints that are used depending on the width of the character which bears it.\nOther Tengwar typefaces with this encoding include http://, https://, https:// or https:// (note that these differ in some details).\nThe following sample shows the first article of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights written in English, according to the traditional English orthography. It should look similar to the picture; if no Tengwar font is installed, it will appear as a jumble of characters because the corresponding ISO 8859-1 characters will appear instead.\nj#\u00b8 9t&amp;5# w`Vb%_ 6EO w6Y5 e7`V`V 2{( z\u00e8Vj# 5% 2x%51T`\u00db 2{( 7v%1+- 4hR 7EO 2{$yYO2 y4% 7]F85^ 2{( z5^8I`B5$I( 2{( dyYj2 zE1 1yY6E2_ 5^( 5#4^(7 5% `C 8q7T1T W w74^(692^H -- \nNote: Some browsers may not display these characters properly.\nUnicode.\nMichael Everson made a proposal to include the Tengwar in the Unicode standard in 1997. The range U+16080 to U+160FF in the SMP was tentatively allocated for Tengwar in the 2023 Unicode roadmap.\nConScript Unicode Registry.\nUnicode character block\nTengwar are included in the unofficial ConScript Unicode Registry (CSUR), which assigns codepoints in the Private Use Area. Tengwar are mapped to the range U+E000\u2013U+E07F. \nThe following Unicode sample (which repeats the one above) is meaningful when viewed under a typeface supporting Tengwar glyphs in the area defined in the ConScript Tengwar proposal:\nSome typefaces that support this proposal are Everson Mono, Tengwar Telcontar, Constructium, Tengwar Formal Unicode, and FreeMonoTengwar (James Kass's Code2000 and Code2001 use an older, incompatible version of the proposal). The eight \u201cAux\u201d variant fonts of Kurinto (such as Kurinto Text Aux, Book Aux, Sans Aux) also support Tengwar.\nIn popular culture.\nTengwar has been used in Tolkien fandom since the publication of \"The Lord of the Rings\" in the 1950s.\nWith the exception of John Rhys-Davies, the actors playing the Fellowship of the Ring in The Lord of the Rings film trilogy have Tengwar tattoos of the English word \"nine\".\nFootballers such as Sergio Ag\u00fcero and Fernando Torres have tattoos with their first name in Tengwar on their forearms.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\nFor a list of linguistic material by Tolkien published in the journals \"Parma Eldalamberon\" and \"Vinyar Tengwar\", see bibliography in Elvish languages (Middle-earth)."}

She is a classically trained musician with a mezzo-soprano vocal range. A child prodigy, Amos entered the Peabody Institute's preparatory division at five, but left at eleven, coming of age as a pianist in Washington, D.C. bars. Amos was the lead singer of the short-lived 1980s pop-rock group Y Kant Tori Read before achieving her breakthrough as a solo artist in the early 1990s. Her songs focus on a broad range of topics, including sexuality, feminism, politics, and religion.\nHer charting singles include \"Crucify\", \"Silent All These Years\", \"God\", \"Cornflake Girl\", \"Caught a Lite Sneeze\", \"Professional Widow\", \"Spark\", \"1000 Oceans\", \"Flavor\" and \"A Sorta Fairytale\". Amos has received five MTV VMA nominations and nine Grammy Award nominations, and won an Echo Klassik award for her \"Night of Hunters\" classical crossover album. She is listed on VH1's 1999 \"100 Greatest Women of Rock and Roll\" at number 71.\nEarly life and education.\nAmos was born on August 23, 1963, at Old Catawba Hospital, in Newton, North Carolina. during her parents' trip from their home in Georgetown in Washington, D.C. She is the third child of Mary Ellen (n\u00e9e Copeland) and Edison McKinley Amos. and was named Myra Ellen Amos.\nSome of Amos's ancestors were Confederate soldiers. In her memoir, \"Piece by Piece\", she talks about the experience of these Confederate ancestors, Margaret Little and Grandaddy Calvin Rice, during the American Civil War.\nWhen she was two years old, her family relocated to Baltimore, Maryland, where her father had moved his Methodist ministry from its original base in Washington, D.C. Her older brother and sister took piano lessons, but Tori did not need them. From the time she could reach the piano, she taught herself to play: when she was two, she could reproduce pieces of music she had only heard once, and, by the age of three, she was composing her own songs. She has described seeing music as structures of light since early childhood, an experience consistent with chromesthesia:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The song appears as light filament once I've cracked it. As long as I've been doing this, which is more than thirty-five years, I've never seen the same light creature in my life. Obviously similar chord progressions follow similar light patterns, but try to imagine the best kaleidoscope ever\u2014after the initial excitement, you start to focus on each element's stunning original detail. For instance, the sound of the words with the sound of the chord progression combined with the rhythm manifests itself in a unique expression of the architecture of color-and-light. ... I started visiting this world when I was three, listening to a piece by B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k; I visited a configuration that day that wasn't on this earth. ... It was euphoric.\nAt five, she became the youngest student ever admitted to the preparatory division of the Peabody Institute. She studied classical piano at Peabody from 1968 to 1974. In 1974, when she was eleven, her scholarship was discontinued, and she was asked to leave. Amos has asserted that she lost the scholarship because of her interest in rock and popular music, coupled with her dislike for reading from sheet music.\nIn 1972, the Amos family moved to Silver Spring, Maryland, where her father became pastor of the Good Shepherd United Methodist church. At thirteen, Amos began playing at gay bars and piano bars, chaperoned by her father.\nAmos won a county teen talent contest in 1977, singing a song called \"More Than Just a Friend\". As a senior at Richard Montgomery High School, she co-wrote \"Baltimore\" with her brother, Mike Amos, for a competition involving the Baltimore Orioles. The song did not win the contest but became her first single, released as a 7-inch single pressed locally for family and friends in 1980 with another Amos-penned composition as a B-side, \"Walking With You\". Before this, she had performed under her middle name, Ellen, and was considering the stage name \"Sammy Jaye\" at the time, but permanently adopted \"Tori\" after a friend's boyfriend told her she looked like a Torrey pine, a tree native to the West Coast.\nCareer.\n1979\u20131989: Career beginnings and Y Kant Tori Read.\nBy the time she was 17, Amos had a stock of homemade demo tapes that her father regularly sent out to record companies and producers. Producer Narada Michael Walden responded favorably: he and Amos cut some tracks together, but none were released. Eventually, Atlantic Records responded to one of the tapes, and, when A&amp;R man Jason Flom flew to Baltimore to audition her in person, the label was convinced and signed her.\nIn 1984, Amos moved to Los Angeles to pursue her music career after several years performing on the piano bar circuit in the Washington, D.C. area.\nIn 1986, Amos formed a musical group called Y Kant Tori Read, named for her difficulty with sight-reading. In addition to Amos, the group was composed of Steve Caton (who would later play guitars on all of her albums until 1999), drummer Matt Sorum, bass player Brad Cobb and, for a short time, keyboardist Jim Tauber. The band went through several iterations of songwriting and recording; Amos has said interference from record executives caused the band to lose its musical edge and direction during this time. Finally, in July 1988, the band's eponymous debut album, \"Y Kant Tori Read\", was released. Although its producer, Joe Chiccarelli, stated that Amos was very happy with the album at the time, Amos has since criticized it, once remarking: \"The only good thing about that album is my ankle high boots.\"\nFollowing the album's commercial failure and the group's subsequent disbanding, Amos began working with other artists (including Stan Ridgway, Sandra Bernhard, and Al Stewart) as a backup vocalist. She also recorded a song called \"Distant Storm\" (which she did not write), which was used in the film \"China O'Brien.\" In the credits, the song is attributed to a band called Tess Makes Good. Amos recorded the vocals for the song in 1988, for $150; she was unaware for several years that the song had actually been heard in a film. Other than the appearance in the film itself, \"Distant Storm\" has never been commercially issued in any format.\n1990\u20131995: \"Little Earthquakes\" and \"Under the Pink\".\nDespite the disappointing reaction to \"Y Kant Tori Read\", Amos still had to comply with her six-record contract with Atlantic Records, which, in 1989, wanted a new record by March 1990. The initial recordings were declined by the label, which Amos felt was because the album had not been properly presented. The album was reworked and expanded under the guidance of Doug Morris and the musical talents of Steve Caton, Eric Rosse, Will MacGregor, Carlo Nuccio, and Dan Nebenzal, resulting in \"Little Earthquakes\", an album recounting her religious upbringing, sexual awakening, struggle to establish her identity, and sexual assault. This album became her commercial and artistic breakthrough, entering the British charts in January 1992 at Number 15. \"Little Earthquakes\" was released in the United States in February 1992 and slowly but steadily began to attract listeners, gaining more attention with the video for the single \"Silent All These Years\".\nAmos traveled to New Mexico with personal and professional partner Eric Rosse in 1993 to write and largely record her second solo record, \"Under the Pink\". The album was received with mostly favorable reviews and sold enough copies to chart at No. 12 on the \"Billboard 200\", a significantly higher position than the preceding album's position at No. 54 on the same chart. However, the album found its biggest success in the UK, debuting at number one upon release in February 1994.\n1996\u20132000: \"Boys for Pele\", \"From the Choirgirl Hotel\", and \"To Venus and Back\".\nHer third solo album, \"Boys for Pele\", was released in January 1996. Prior to its release, the first single, \"Caught a Lite Sneeze\" became the first full song released for streaming online prior to an album's release.\nThe album was recorded in a church in Delgany, County Wicklow, Ireland, with Amos taking advantage of the church's acoustics. For this album, Amos used the harpsichord, harmonium, and clavichord as well as the piano. The album garnered mixed reviews upon its release, with some critics praising its intensity and uniqueness while others bemoaned its comparative impenetrability. Despite the album's erratic lyrical content and instrumentation, the latter of which kept it away from mainstream audiences, \"Boys for Pele\" is Amos' most successful simultaneous transatlantic release, reaching No. 2 on the UK Top 40 and No. 2 on the Billboard 200 upon its release.\nFueled by the desire to have her own recording studio to distance herself from record company executives, Amos had the barn of her home in Cornwall, UK converted into the state-of-the-art recording studio of Martian Engineering Studios.\n\"From the Choirgirl Hotel\" and \"To Venus and Back\", released in May 1998 and September 1999, respectively, differ greatly from previous albums. Amos' trademark acoustic, piano-based sound is largely replaced with arrangements that include elements of electronica and dance music with vocal washes. The underlying themes of both albums deal with womanhood and Amos' own miscarriages and marriage. Reviews for \"From the Choirgirl Hotel\" were mostly favorable and praised Amos' continued artistic originality. Debut sales for \"From the Choirgirl Hotel\" are Amos' best to date, selling 153,000 copies in its first week. \"To Venus and Back\", a two-disc release of original studio material and live material recorded from the previous world tour, received mostly positive reviews and included the first major-label single available for sale as a digital download.\n2001\u20132004: \"Strange Little Girls\" and \"Scarlet's Walk\".\nShortly after giving birth to her daughter, Amos decided to record a cover album, taking songs written by men about women and reversing the gender roles to reflect a woman's perspective. That became \"Strange Little Girls\", released in September 2001. The album is Amos' first concept album, with artwork featuring Amos photographed in character of the women portrayed in each song. Amos would later reveal that a stimulus for the album was to end her contract with Atlantic without giving them original songs; Amos felt that since 1998, the label had not been properly promoting her and had trapped her in a contract by refusing to sell her to another label.\nWith her Atlantic contract fulfilled after a 15-year stint, Amos signed to Epic in late 2001. In October 2002, Amos released \"Scarlet's Walk\", another concept album. Described as a \"sonic novel\", the album explores Amos' alter ego, Scarlet, intertwined with her cross-country concert tour following 9/11. Through the songs, Amos explores such topics as the history of America, American people, Native American history, pornography, masochism, homophobia and misogyny. The album had a strong debut at No. 7 on the Billboard 200. \"Scarlet's Walk\" is Amos' last album to date to reach certified gold status from the RIAA.\nNot long after Amos was ensconced with her new label, she received unsettling news when Polly Anthony resigned as president of Epic Records in 2003. Anthony had been one of the primary reasons Amos signed with the label and as a result of her resignation, Amos formed the Bridge Entertainment Group. Further trouble for Amos occurred the following year when her label, Epic/Sony Music Entertainment, merged with BMG Entertainment as a result of the industry's decline.\n2005\u20132008: \"The Beekeeper\" and \"American Doll Posse\".\nAmos released two more albums with Epic, \"The Beekeeper\" (2005) and \"American Doll Posse\" (2007). Both albums received generally favorable reviews. \"The Beekeeper\" was conceptually influenced by the ancient art of beekeeping, which she considered a source of female inspiration and empowerment. Through extensive study, Amos also wove in the stories of the Gnostic gospels and the removal of women from a position of power within the Christian church to create an album based largely on religion and politics. The album debuted at No. 5 on the Billboard 200, placing her in an elite group of women who have secured five or more US Top 10 album debuts. While the newly merged label was present throughout the production process of \"The Beekeeper\", Amos and her crew nearly completed her next project, \"American Doll Posse\", before inviting the label to listen to it. \"American Doll Posse\", another concept album, is fashioned around a group of girls (the \"posse\") who are used as a theme of alter-egos of Amos'. Musically and stylistically, the album saw Amos return to a more confrontational nature. Like its predecessor, \"American Doll Posse\" debuted at No. 5 on the Billboard 200.\nDuring her tenure with Epic Records, Amos also released a retrospective collection titled \"Tales of a Librarian\" (2003) through her former label, Atlantic Records; a two-disc DVD set \"Fade to Red\" (2006) containing most of Amos' solo music videos, released through the Warner Bros. reissue imprint Rhino; a five disc box set titled \"\" (2006), celebrating Amos' 15-year solo career through remastered album tracks, remixes, alternate mixes, demos, and a string of unreleased songs from album recording sessions, also released through Rhino; and numerous official bootlegs from two world tours, \"The Original Bootlegs\" (2005) and \"Legs &amp; Boots\" (2007) through Epic Records.\n2008\u20132011: \"Abnormally Attracted to Sin\" and \"Midwinter Graces\".\nIn May 2008, Amos announced that, due to creative and financial disagreements with Epic Records, she had negotiated an end to her contract with the record label, and would be operating independently of major record labels on future work. In September of the same year, Amos released a live album and DVD, \"Live at Montreux 1991/1992\", through Eagle Rock Entertainment, of two performances she gave at the Montreux Jazz Festival very early on in her career while promoting her debut solo album, \"Little Earthquakes\". By December, after a chance encounter with chairman and CEO of Universal Music Group, Doug Morris, Amos signed a \"joint venture\" deal with Universal Republic Records.\n\"Abnormally Attracted to Sin\", Amos' tenth solo studio album and her first album released through Universal Republic, was released in May 2009 to mostly positive reviews. The album debuted in the top 10 of the Billboard 200, making it Amos' seventh album to do so. \"Abnormally Attracted to Sin\", admitted Amos, is a \"personal album\", not a conceptual one, with the album exploring themes of power, boundaries, and the subjective view of sin. Continuing her distribution deal with Universal Republic, Amos released \"Midwinter Graces\", her first seasonal album, in November of the same year. The album features reworked versions of traditional carols, as well as original songs written by Amos.\nDuring her contract with the label, Amos recorded vocals for two songs for David Byrne's collaboration album with Fatboy Slim, titled \"Here Lies Love\", which was released in April 2010. In July of the same year, the DVD \"Tori Amos- Live from the Artists Den\" was released exclusively through Barnes &amp; Noble.\nAfter a brief tour from June to September 2010, Amos released a live album \"From Russia With Love\" in December the same year, recorded in Moscow on September 3, 2010. The limited edition set included a signature edition Lomography Diana F+ camera, along with two lenses, a roll of film and one of five photographs taken of Amos during her time in Moscow. The set was released exclusively through her website and only 2000 copies were produced.\n2011\u20132015: \"Night of Hunters\", \"Gold Dust\", and \"Unrepentant Geraldines\".\nIn September 2011, Amos released her first classical-style music album, \"Night of Hunters\", featuring variations on a theme to pay tribute to composers such as Bach, Chopin, Debussy, Granados, Satie and Schubert, on the Deutsche Grammophon label, a division of Universal Music Group. Amos recorded the album with several musicians, including the Apollon Musag\u00e8te string quartet.\nTo mark the 20th anniversary of her debut album, \"Little Earthquakes\" (1992), Amos released an album of songs from her back catalogue re-worked and re-recorded with the Metropole Orchestra. The album, titled \"Gold Dust\", was released in October 2012 through Deutsche Grammophon.\nOn May 1, 2012, Amos announced the formation of her own record label, Transmission Galactic, which she said she intended to use to develop new artists.\nIn 2013, Amos collaborated with the Bullitts on the track \"Wait Until Tomorrow\" from their debut album, \"They Die by Dawn &amp; Other Short Stories\". She also stated in an interview that a new album and tour would materialize in 2014 and that it would be a \"return to contemporary music\".\nSeptember 2013 saw the launch of Amos' musical project adaptation of George MacDonald's \"The Light Princess\", along with book writer Samuel Adamson and Marianne Elliott. It premiered at London's Royal National Theatre and ended in February 2014. \"The Light Princess\" and its lead actress, Rosalie Craig, were nominated for Best Musical and Best Musical Performance respectively at the Evening Standard Award. Craig won the Best Musical Performance category.\nAmos' 14th studio album, \"Unrepentant Geraldines\", was released on May 13, 2014, via Mercury Classics/Universal Music Classics in the US. Its first single, \"Trouble's Lament\", was released on March 28. The album was supported by the Unrepentant Geraldines Tour which began May 5, 2014, in Cork and continued across Europe, Africa, North America, and Australia, ending in Brisbane on November 21, 2014. In Sydney, Amos performed two orchestral concerts, reminiscent of the Gold Dust Orchestral Tour, with the Sydney Symphony Orchestra at the Sydney Opera House.\nAccording to a press release, \"Unrepentant Geraldines\" was a \"return to her core identity as a creator of contemporary songs of exquisite beauty following a series of more classically-inspired and innovative musical projects of the last four years. [It is] both one further step in the artistic evolution of one of the most successful and influential artists of her generation, and a return to the inspiring and personal music that Amos is known for all around the world.\"\nThe 2-CD set \"The Light Princess (Original Cast Recording)\" was released on October 9, 2015, via Universal/Mercury Classics. Apart from the original cast performances, the recording also includes two songs from the musical (\"Highness in the Sky\" and \"Darkest Hour') performed by Amos.\n2016\u20132024: \"Native Invader\", \"Christmastide\" and \"Ocean to Ocean\".\nOn November 18, 2016, Amos released a deluxe version of the album \"Boys for Pele\" to commemorate the 20th anniversary of the original release. This follows the deluxe re-releases of her first two albums in 2015.\nOn September 8, 2017, Amos released \"Native Invader\", accompanied by a world tour. During the summer of 2017, Amos launched three songs from the album: \"Cloud Riders\", \"Up the Creek\", and \"Reindeer King\", the latter featuring string arrangements by John Philip Shenale. Produced by Amos, the album explores topics like American politics and environmental issues, mixed with mythological elements and first-person narrations. \"Native Invader\" obtained a score of 76 out of 100 on the review aggregator website Metacritic, based on 17 reviews, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".\nOn November 9, 2020, Amos announced the release of a holiday-themed EP entitled \"Christmastide\" on December 4, digitally and on limited-edition vinyl. The EP consists of four original songs and features her first work with bandmates Matt Chamberlain and Jon Evans since 2009. Amos recorded the EP remotely due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nOn September 20, 2021, Amos announced her sixteenth studio album, \"Ocean to Ocean\", which was released on October 29. The album was written and recorded in Cornwall during lockdown as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and explores \"a universal story of going to rock bottom and renewing yourself all over again\". Amos embarked on a European and United States tour in support of the album in 2022, and continued to support the album in 2023 with a European Tour in March and April and additional US dates in June and July . Matt Chamberlain and Jon Evans were featured on drums and bass guitar respectively, their first collaboration with Amos on an album since 2009's \"Midwinter Graces\". For the 2022 and 2023 tour, Amos was joined by Jon Evans and the drummer Ash Soan.\nShe appeared at the EPIX original docuseries \"Women Who Rock\" which premiered on July 10, 2022.\nIn 2023, Amos and Trevor Horn covered Kendrick Lamar's \"Swimming Pools (Drank)\". She also released a remix dance single titled \"Tequila,\" produced by Paul Woolford.\nOn November 1, 2024, Amos announced the release of a live album, \"Diving Deep Live\", on December 6, 2024, consisting of recordings from her 2022-23 tour in support of \"Ocean to Ocean\". it was released on double vinyl, on CD and digitally.\n2025-present: \"Tori and the Muses\" and \"In Times of Dragons\".\nOn February 28, 2025, Amos released a surprise album, \"The Music of Tori and the Muses\", as a companion project to her illustrated children's book \"Tori and the Muses\", published on March 4. The album featured nine original songs and featured Jon Evans on bass guitar and Matt Chamberlain on drums. Touring drummer Ash Soan featured on drums on the tracks \"Knocking\", \"Spike's Lament\", and \"Rain Brings Change\".\nAmos announced her upcoming eighteenth studio album, \"In Times of Dragons\", on October 6, 2025, for release in 2026. Amos described the album as \"a metaphorical story about the fight for Democracy over Tyranny, reflecting the current abhorrent non-accidental burning down of democracy in real time by the 'Dictator believing Lizard Demons' in their usurpation of America.\" The album will be accompanied by a world tour beginning in the UK in Sheffield on April 8, 2026 before visiting Europe and the United States. Amos will be accompanied by touring bassist Jon Evans, drummer Ash Soan and a trio of backing vocalists. This will be the first time Amos has utilized backing vocalists in a live setting.\nIn print.\nAmos and her music have been the subject of numerous official and unofficial books, as well as academic critique, including \"Tori Amos: Lyrics\" (2001) illustrated by Herb Leonhard, and an earlier biography, \"Tori Amos: All These Years\" (1996) by Kalen Rogers.\nReleased in conjunction with \"The Beekeeper\", Amos co-authored an autobiography with rock music journalist Ann Powers titled \"Piece by Piece\" (2005). The book's subject is Amos' interest in mythology and religion, exploring her songwriting process, rise to fame, and her relationship with Atlantic Records. Amos released her second memoir, called \"Resistance: A Songwriter's Story of Hope, Change, and Courage\" on May 5, 2020.\nImage Comics released \"Comic Book Tattoo\" (2008), a collection of comic stories, each based on or inspired by songs recorded by Amos. Editor Rantz Hoseley worked with Amos to gather 80 different artists for the book, including Neil Gaiman, Carla Speed McNeil, Mark Buckingham, C.B. Cebulski, Nikki Cook, Hope Larson, John Ney Reiber, Ryan Kelly, Pia Guerra, David Mack, and Leah Moore.\n\"Tori Amos: In the Studio\" (2011) by Jake Brown features an in-depth look at Amos' career, discography, and recording process. \"Sing Us a Song, Piano Woman: Female Fans and the Music of Tori Amos\" (2013) by Adrienne Trier-Bieniek explores the ways women are represented in pop culture and the many-layered relationships female fans build with feminist musicians in general and with Amos in particular.\n\"Tori Amos: Little Earthquakes\" (2022), written by Amos and Neil Gaiman, is a graphic novel marking the 30th anniversary of the release of \"Little Earthquakes\". Written by Amos and illustrated by Demelsa Haughton, the children's book \"Tori and the Muses\" was released on March 4, 2025.\nPersonal life.\nAmos married English sound engineer Mark Hawley on February 22, 1998. They have one daughter, Natashya L\u00f3rien Hawley, born September 5, 2000. They live in Bude, UK.\nAmos' mother, Mary Ellen, died on May 11, 2019. Her brother, Edison Michael Amos, died on November 22, 2004. Her father, Edison McKinley Amos, died on August 3, 2025. \nEarly in her professional career, Amos befriended author Neil Gaiman, who became a fan after she referred to him in the song \"Tear in Your Hand\" and also in print interviews. Although created before the two met, the character Delirium from Gaiman's \"The Sandman\" series is inspired by Amos; Gaiman has stated that they \"steal shamelessly from each other\". She wrote the foreword to his collection \"\"; he in turn wrote the introduction to \"Comic Book Tattoo\". Gaiman is godfather to her daughter, and a poem written for her birth, \"Blueberry Girl\", was published as a children's book of the same name in 2009. In 2019, Amos performed the British standard \"A Nightingale Sang in Berkeley Square\" over the closing credits of season one of Gaiman's TV series \"Good Omens\", based on the novel of the same name written by Gaiman and Terry Pratchett.\nActivism.\nIn June 1994, the Rape, Abuse &amp; Incest National Network (RAINN), a toll-free help line in the US connecting callers with their local rape crisis center, was founded. Amos stated in a 1994 interview that she was raped at knife point when she was 22 and did not report the incident to the authorities. She answered the ceremonial first call to launch the hotline. She was the first national spokesperson for the organization and has continued to be closely associated with RAINN. On August 18, 2013, a concert in honor of her 50th birthday was held, an event which raised money for RAINN. On August 22, 2020, Amos appeared on a panel called Artistry &amp; Activism at the diversity and inclusion digital global conference CARLA.\nRelationship with Cherokee culture.\nAmos has frequently referred to Native American culture, history, and spirituality in her music and visual art, as well as making personal connections with the culture. She has spoken about ancestors on her mother's side she said were of Cherokee descent. \nOf particular importance to her as a child was her maternal grandfather, Calvin Clinton Copeland, whom she has cited as a great source of inspiration and guidance, offering a pantheistic spiritual alternative to her father and paternal grandmother's traditional Christianity. She has said her great-grandmother evaded the Trail of Tears by taking refuge in the Great Smoky Mountains, her family's place of residence. Amos took a trip through the Smokies which formed the creative basis for her album \"Native Invader\". While talking to \"The Guardian\" about taking Ayahuasca and attending sweatlodge ceremonies with her sister, Amos has also said, \"I'm not in a position to speak for First Nation people \u2013 that's a sacred task.\"\nLegacy.\nArtists influenced by (and/or admirers of) Amos's work include Alanis Morissette, Amy Lee of Evanescence, Jewel, Halsey, Brad Walsh, Olly Alexander of Years &amp; Years, Perfume Genius, Justin Timberlake, Olivia Rodrigo, St. Vincent, Leighton Meester, and Jack Colwell.\nDiscography.\nStudio albums\nTours.\nAmos, who has been performing in bars and clubs from as early as 1976 and under her professional name as early as 1991, has performed more than 1,000 shows since her first world tour in 1992. In 2003, Amos was voted fifth best touring act by the readers of \"Rolling Stone\" magazine. Her concerts are notable for their changing set lists from night to night.\nAmos' first world tour began on January 29, 1992, in London and ended on November 30, 1992, in Auckland. She performed solo with a Yamaha CP-80 unless the venue was able to provide a piano. The tour included 142 concerts around the globe.\nAmos' second world tour began on February 24, 1994, in Newcastle upon Tyne and ended on December 13, 1994, in Perth, Western Australia. Amos performed solo each night on her iconic B\u00f6sendorfer piano, and on a prepared piano during \"Bells for Her\". The tour included 181 concerts.\nThe third world tour began on February 23, 1996, in Ipswich, England, and ended on November 11, 1996, in Boulder. Amos performed each night on piano, harpsichord, and harmonium, with Steve Caton on guitar on some songs. The tour included 187 concerts.\nAmos' first band tour. Amos, on piano and Kurzweil keyboard, was joined by Steve Caton on guitar, Matt Chamberlain on drums, and Jon Evans on bass. The tour began on April 18, 1998, in Fort Lauderdale and ended on December 3, 1998, in East Lansing, Michigan, including 137 concerts. Highlights from the tour were included on the live disc of \"To Venus and Back\".\nAmos' fifth tour was North America\u2013only. The first part of the tour was co-headlining with Alanis Morissette and featured the same band and equipment line-up as in 1998. Amos and the band continued for eight shows before Amos embarked on a series of solo shows. The tour began on August 18, 1999, in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, and ended on December 9, 1999, in Denver, including 46 concerts.\nThis tour was Amos' first since becoming a mother in 2000 and her first tour fully solo since 1994 (Steve Caton was present on some songs in 1996). It saw Amos perform on piano, Rhodes piano, and Wurlitzer electric piano, and though the tour was in support of her covers album, the set lists were not strictly covers-oriented. Having brought her one-year-old daughter on the road with her, this tour was also one of Amos' shortest ventures, lasting just three months. It began on August 30, 2001, in London and ended on December 17, 2001, in Milan, including 55 concerts.\nAmos' seventh tour saw her reunited with Matt Chamberlain and Jon Evans, but not Steve Caton. The first part of the tour, which featured Amos on piano, Kurzweil, Rhodes, and Wurlitzer, was six months long and Amos went out again in the summer of 2003 for a tour with Ben Folds opening. The tour began on November 7, 2002, in Tampa and ended on September 4, 2003, in West Palm Beach, featuring 124 concerts. The final show of the tour was filmed and released as part of a DVD/CD set titled \"Welcome to Sunny Florida\" (the set also included a studio EP titled \"Scarlet's Hidden Treasures\", an extension of the \"Scarlet's Walk\" album).\nThis tour began on April 1, 2005, in Clearwater, Florida, with Amos on piano, two Hammond B-3 organs, and Rhodes. The tour also encompassed Australia for the first time since 1994. Amos announced at a concert on this tour that she would never stop touring but would scale down the tours. Amos returned to the road in August and September for the Summer of Sin North America leg, ending on September 17, 2005, in Los Angeles. The tour featured \"Tori's Piano Bar\", where fans could nominate cover songs on Amos' website which she would then choose from to play in a special section of each show. One of the songs chosen was the Kylie Minogue hit \"Can't Get You Out of My Head\", which Amos dedicated to her the day after Minogue's breast cancer was announced to the public. Other songs performed by Amos include the Doors' \"People Are Strange\", Depeche Mode's \"Personal Jesus\", Joni Mitchell's \"The Circle Game\", Madonna's \"Live to Tell\" and \"Like a Prayer\", Bj\u00f6rk's \"Hyperballad\", Led Zeppelin's \"When the Levee Breaks\" (which she debuted in Austin, Texas, just after the events Hurricane Katrina), Kate Bush's \"And Dream of Sheep\" and Crowded House's \"Don't Dream It's Over\", dedicating it to drummer Paul Hester who had died a week before. The entire concert tour featured 82 concerts, and six full-length concerts were released as \"The Original Bootlegs\".\nThis was Amos' first tour with a full band since her 1999 Five and a Half Weeks Tour, accompanied by long-time bandmates Jon Evans and Matt Chamberlain, with guitarist Dan Phelps rounding out Amos' new band. Amos' equipment included her piano, a Hammond B-3 organ, and two Yamaha S90 ES keyboards. The tour kicked off with its European leg in Rome, Italy, on May 28, 2007, which lasted through July, concluding in Israel; the Australian leg took place during September; the North American leg lasted from October to December 16, 2007, when the tour concluded in Los Angeles. Amos opened each show dressed as one of the four non-Tori personae from the album, then Amos would emerge as herself to perform for the remaining two-thirds of the show. The entire concert tour featured 93 concerts, and 27 full-length concerts of the North American tour were released as official bootlegs in the \"Legs and Boots\" series.\nFor her tenth tour, Amos returned to the trio format of her 2002 and 2003 tours with bassist Jon Evans and drummer Matt Chamberlain while expanding her lineup of keyboards by adding three M-Audio MIDI controllers to her ensemble of her piano, a Hammond B-3 organ, and a Yamaha S90 ES keyboard. The North American and European band tour began on July 10, 2009, in Seattle, Washington, and ended in Warsaw on October 10, 2009. A solo leg through Australia began in Melbourne on November 12, 2009, and ended in Brisbane on November 24, 2009. The entire tour featured 63 concerts. This tour was the last tour to feature Matt Chamberlain on drums to date, as well as the last tour to feature Jon Evans on bass until the Ocean to Ocean Tour in 2022.\nAmos' eleventh tour was her first with a string quartet, Apollon Musag\u00e8te, (Amos' equipment includes her piano and a Yamaha S90 ES keyboard) and her first time touring in South Africa. It kicked off on September 28, 2011, in Helsinki Ice Hall, Finland, and ended on December 22, 2011, in Dallas, Texas.\nAmos began her 2012 tour in Rotterdam on October 1.\nAmos began her 2014 world tour on May 5, 2014, in Cork, Ireland, and concluded it in Brisbane, Australia, on November 21, after playing 73 concerts.\nAmos' 2017 tour in support of the \"Native Invader\" album kicked off on September 6, 2017, with a series of European shows in Cork, Ireland, moving on to North America in October.\nAmos embarked on tour in 2022 in support of the \"Ocean to Ocean\" album, with the bassist John Evans and the drummer Ash Soan. The tour was originally set to begin in Berlin, Germany, but all mainland Europe dates were subsequently postponed due to the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The tour began in the United Kingdom with dates in London, Glasgow and Manchester before moving on to Ireland with dates in Dublin and Cork. The North American tour began in April 2022 in Dallas, Texas, and concluded in June in Los Angeles, California. The 2023 European tour began in Edinburgh, UK, in March 2023. A second American leg followed short after until the end of July. In total, the tour featured 94 shows and is chronicled on Diving Deep Live.\nAwards and nominations.\n! scope=\"col\" | Award\n! scope=\"col\" | Year\n! scope=\"col\" | Nominee(s)\n! scope=\"col\" | Category\n! scope=\"col\" | Result\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\"| Ref.\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=3| Brit Awards\n!scope=\"row\"|Cash Box Year-End Awards\n! scope=\"row\"| Critics' Choice Documentary Awards\n! scope=\"row\"| ECHO Awards\n! scope=\"row\"| ECHO Klassik Awards\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=4| GAFFA Awards\n! scope=\"row\"| George Peabody Medal\n! scope=\"row\"| Glamour Awards\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=9| Grammy Awards\n! scope=\"row\"| Hollywood Music in Media Awards\n! scope=\"row\"| Hungarian Music Awards\n! scope=\"row\"| MTV Europe Music Awards\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=4| MTV Video Music Awards\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=3| MVPA Awards\n!scope=\"row\"|Music Week Women in Music\n! scope=\"row\"| NME Awards\n! scope=\"row\"| North Carolina Music Hall of Fame\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=5| Pollstar Concert Industry Awards\n! scope=\"row\"| Q Awards\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=2| WhatsOnStage Awards\n! scope=\"row\"| \u017deb\u0159\u00edk Music Awards\nOn May 21, 2020, Amos was invited to and gave special remarks at her alma mater Johns Hopkins University's 2020 Commencement ceremony. Other notable guest speakers during the virtual ceremony included Reddit co-founder and commencement speaker Alexis Ohanian; philanthropist and former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg; Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and a leading member of the White House Coronavirus Task Force; and senior class president Pavan Patel.\nFilm appearances.\nAmos appears as a wedding singer in the film \"Mona Lisa Smile\". She had previously auditioned for a role as a member of Beverly's band, Cherry Bomb, in the 1986 film \"Howard the Duck\". \nAmos performed a cover of R.E.M.'s \"Losing My Religion\", as well as the original song \"Butterfly\", for the soundtrack of John Singleton's 1995 film \"Higher Learning\". Her song \"Talula\" was featured in the epic disaster film \"Twister\" (1996). \"Professional Widow\" was featured in the action film \"Escape from L.A.\" (1996). \"Siren\" was featured in the romantic drama \"Great Expectations\" (1998). The songs \"'Murder' He Says\" and \"You Belong To Me\" were featured in the films \"Mona Lisa Smile\" (2003). \"Flicker\" was featured in the film \"Audrie &amp; Daisy\" (2016). \nNumerous songs of hers have been included in television series soundtracks.

{"id": "31474", "revid": "20483999", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31474", "title": "Transcription factor", "text": "Protein that regulates the rate of DNA transcription\nIn molecular biology, a transcription factor (TF) (or sequence-specific DNA-binding factor) is a protein that controls the rate of transcription of genetic information from DNA to messenger RNA, by binding to a specific DNA sequence. The function of TFs is to regulate\u2014turn on and off\u2014genes in order to make sure that they are expressed in the desired cells at the right time and in the right amount throughout the life of the cell and the organism. Groups of TFs function in a coordinated fashion to direct cell division, cell growth, and cell death throughout life; cell migration and organization (body plan) during embryonic development; and intermittently in response to signals from outside the cell, such as a hormone. There are approximately 1600 TFs in the human genome, where half of them are C2H2 zinc fingers. Transcription factors are members of the proteome as well as regulome.\nTFs work alone or with other proteins in a complex, by promoting (as an activator), or blocking (as a repressor) the recruitment of RNA polymerase (the enzyme that performs the transcription of genetic information from DNA to RNA) to specific genes.\nA defining feature of TFs is that they contain at least one DNA-binding domain (DBD), which attaches to a specific sequence of DNA adjacent to the genes that they regulate. TFs are grouped into classes based on their DBDs. Other proteins such as coactivators, chromatin remodelers, histone acetyltransferases, histone deacetylases, kinases, and methylases are also essential to gene regulation, but lack DNA-binding domains, and therefore are not TFs.\nTFs are of interest in medicine because TF mutations can cause specific diseases, and medications can be potentially targeted toward them.\nNumber.\nTranscription factors are essential for the regulation of gene expression and are, as a consequence, found in all living organisms. The number of transcription factors found within an organism increases with genome size, and larger genomes tend to have more transcription factors per gene.\nThere are approximately 2800 proteins in the human genome that contain DNA-binding domains, and 1600 of these are presumed to function as transcription factors, where half of them (~800) are C2H2 zinc finger proteins. Therefore, approximately 10% of genes in the genome code for transcription factors, which makes this family the single largest family of human proteins. Furthermore, genes are often flanked by several binding sites for distinct transcription factors, and efficient expression of each of these genes requires the cooperative action of several different transcription factors (see, for example, hepatocyte nuclear factors). Hence, the combinatorial use of a subset of the approximately 2000 human transcription factors easily accounts for the unique regulation of each gene in the human genome during development.\nMechanism.\nTranscription factors bind to either enhancer or promoter regions of DNA adjacent to the genes that they regulate based on recognizing specific DNA motifs. Depending on the transcription factor, the transcription of the adjacent gene is either up- or down-regulated. Transcription factors use a variety of mechanisms for the regulation of gene expression. These mechanisms include:\nFunction.\nTranscription factors are one of the groups of proteins that read and interpret the genetic \"blueprint\" in the DNA. They bind to the DNA and help initiate a program of increased or decreased gene transcription. As such, they are vital for many important cellular processes. Below are some of the important functions and biological roles transcription factors are involved in:\nBasal transcriptional regulation.\nIn eukaryotes, an important class of transcription factors called general transcription factors (GTFs) are necessary for transcription to occur. Many of these GTFs do not actually bind DNA, but rather are part of the large transcription preinitiation complex that interacts with RNA polymerase directly. The most common GTFs are TFIIA, TFIIB, TFIID (see also TATA binding protein), TFIIE, TFIIF, and TFIIH. The preinitiation complex binds to promoter regions of DNA upstream to the gene that they regulate.\nDifferential enhancement of transcription.\nOther transcription factors differentially regulate the expression of various genes by binding to enhancer regions of DNA adjacent to regulated genes. These transcription factors are critical to making sure that genes are expressed in the right cell at the right time and in the right amount, depending on the changing requirements of the organism.\nDevelopment.\nMany transcription factors in multicellular organisms are involved in development. Responding to stimuli, these transcription factors turn on/off the transcription of the appropriate genes, which, in turn, allows for changes in cell morphology or activities needed for cell fate determination and cellular differentiation. The Hox transcription factor family, for example, is important for proper body pattern formation in organisms as diverse as fruit flies to humans. Another example is the transcription factor encoded by the sex-determining region Y (SRY) gene, which plays a major role in determining sex in humans.\nResponse to intercellular signals.\nCells can communicate with each other by releasing molecules that produce signaling cascades within another receptive cell. If the signal requires upregulation or downregulation of genes in the recipient cell, often transcription factors will be downstream in the signaling cascade. Estrogen signaling is an example of a fairly short signaling cascade that involves the estrogen receptor transcription factor: Estrogen is secreted by tissues such as the ovaries and placenta, crosses the cell membrane of the recipient cell, and is bound by the estrogen receptor in the cell's cytoplasm. The estrogen receptor then goes to the cell's nucleus and binds to its DNA-binding sites, changing the transcriptional regulation of the associated genes.\nResponse to environment.\nNot only do transcription factors act downstream of signaling cascades related to biological stimuli but they can also be downstream of signaling cascades involved in environmental stimuli. Examples include heat shock factor (HSF), which upregulates genes necessary for survival at higher temperatures, hypoxia inducible factor (HIF), which upregulates genes necessary for cell survival in low-oxygen environments, and sterol regulatory element binding protein (SREBP), which helps maintain proper lipid levels in the cell.\nCell cycle control.\nMany transcription factors, especially some that are proto-oncogenes or tumor suppressors, help regulate the cell cycle and as such determine how large a cell will get and when it can divide into two daughter cells. One example is the Myc oncogene, which has important roles in cell growth and apoptosis.\nPathogenesis.\nTranscription factors can also be used to alter gene expression in a host cell to promote pathogenesis. A well studied example of this are the transcription-activator like effectors (TAL effectors) secreted by Xanthomonas bacteria. When injected into plants, these proteins can enter the nucleus of the plant cell, bind plant promoter sequences, and activate transcription of plant genes that aid in bacterial infection. TAL effectors contain a central repeat region in which there is a simple relationship between the identity of two critical residues in sequential repeats and sequential DNA bases in the TAL effector's target site. This property likely makes it easier for these proteins to evolve in order to better compete with the defense mechanisms of the host cell.\nRegulation.\nIt is common in biology for important processes to have multiple layers of regulation and control. This is also true with transcription factors: Not only do transcription factors control the rates of transcription to regulate the amounts of gene products (RNA and protein) available to the cell but transcription factors themselves are regulated (often by other transcription factors). Below is a brief synopsis of some of the ways that the activity of transcription factors can be regulated:\nSynthesis.\nTranscription factors (like all proteins) are transcribed from a gene on a chromosome into RNA, and then the RNA is translated into protein. Any of these steps can be regulated to affect the production (and thus activity) of a transcription factor. An implication of this is that transcription factors can regulate themselves. For example, in a negative feedback loop, the transcription factor acts as its own repressor: If the transcription factor protein binds the DNA of its own gene, it down-regulates the production of more of itself. This is one mechanism to maintain low levels of a transcription factor in a cell.\nNuclear localization.\nIn eukaryotes, transcription factors (like most proteins) are transcribed in the nucleus but are then translated in the cell's cytoplasm. Many proteins that are active in the nucleus contain nuclear localization signals that direct them to the nucleus. But, for many transcription factors, this is a key point in their regulation. Important classes of transcription factors such as some nuclear receptors must first bind a ligand while in the cytoplasm before they can relocate to the nucleus.\nActivation.\nTranscription factors may be activated or deactivated through their signal-sensing or effector domains. However, not all transcription factors have an effector domain; for example, approximately 400 C2H2 zinc finger transcription factors contain only DNA-binding domains (DBDs). Activation or repression of transcription factors can occur through a number of mechanisms, including:\nAccessibility of DNA-binding site.\nIn eukaryotes, DNA is organized with the help of histones into compact particles called nucleosomes, where sequences of about 147 DNA base pairs make ~1.65 turns around histone protein octamers. DNA within nucleosomes is inaccessible to many transcription factors. Some transcription factors, so-called pioneer factors are still able to bind their DNA binding sites on the nucleosomal DNA. For most other transcription factors, the nucleosome should be actively unwound by molecular motors such as chromatin remodelers. Alternatively, the nucleosome can be partially unwrapped by thermal fluctuations, allowing temporary access to the transcription factor binding site. In many cases, a transcription factor needs to compete for binding to its DNA binding site with other transcription factors and histones or non-histone chromatin proteins. Pairs of transcription factors and other proteins can play antagonistic roles (activator versus repressor) in the regulation of the same gene.\nAvailability of other cofactors/transcription factors.\nMost transcription factors do not work alone. Many large TF families form complex homotypic or heterotypic interactions through dimerization. For gene transcription to occur, a number of transcription factors must bind to DNA regulatory sequences. This collection of transcription factors, in turn, recruit intermediary proteins such as cofactors that allow efficient recruitment of the preinitiation complex and RNA polymerase. Thus, for a single transcription factor to initiate transcription, all of these other proteins must also be present, and the transcription factor must be in a state where it can bind to them if necessary.\nCofactors are proteins that modulate the effects of transcription factors. Cofactors are interchangeable between specific gene promoters; the protein complex that occupies the promoter DNA and the amino acid sequence of the cofactor determine its spatial conformation. For example, certain steroid receptors can exchange cofactors with NF-\u03baB, which is a switch between inflammation and cellular differentiation; thereby steroids can affect the inflammatory response and function of certain tissues.\nInteraction with methylated cytosine.\nTranscription factors and methylated cytosines in DNA both have major roles in regulating gene expression. (Methylation of cytosine in DNA primarily occurs where cytosine is followed by guanine in the 5' to 3' DNA sequence, a CpG site.) Methylation of CpG sites in a promoter region of a gene usually represses gene transcription, while methylation of CpGs in the body of a gene increases expression. TET enzymes play a central role in demethylation of methylated cytosines. Demethylation of CpGs in a gene promoter by TET enzyme activity increases transcription of the gene.\nThe DNA binding sites of 519 transcription factors were evaluated. Of these, 169 transcription factors (33%) did not have CpG dinucleotides in their binding sites, and 33 transcription factors (6%) could bind to a CpG-containing motif but did not display a preference for a binding site with either a methylated or unmethylated CpG. There were 117 transcription factors (23%) that were inhibited from binding to their binding sequence if it contained a methylated CpG site, 175 transcription factors (34%) that had enhanced binding if their binding sequence had a methylated CpG site, and 25 transcription factors (5%) were either inhibited or had enhanced binding depending on where in the binding sequence the methylated CpG was located.\nTET enzymes do not specifically bind to methylcytosine except when recruited (see DNA demethylation). Multiple transcription factors important in cell differentiation and lineage specification, including NANOG, SALL4A, WT1, EBF1, PU.1, and E2A, have been shown to recruit TET enzymes to specific genomic loci (primarily enhancers) to act on methylcytosine (mC) and convert it to hydroxymethylcytosine hmC (and in most cases marking them for subsequent complete demethylation to cytosine). TET-mediated conversion of mC to hmC appears to disrupt the binding of 5mC-binding proteins including MECP2 and MBD (Methyl-CpG-binding domain) proteins, facilitating nucleosome remodeling and the binding of transcription factors, thereby activating transcription of those genes. EGR1 is an important transcription factor in memory formation. It has an essential role in brain neuron epigenetic reprogramming. The transcription factor EGR1 recruits the TET1 protein that initiates a pathway of DNA demethylation. EGR1, together with TET1, is employed in programming the distribution of methylation sites on brain DNA during brain development and in learning (see Epigenetics in learning and memory).\nStructure.\nTranscription factors are modular in structure and contain the following domains:\nDNA-binding domain.\nThe portion (domain) of the transcription factor that binds DNA is called its DNA-binding domain. Below is a partial list of some of the major families of DNA-binding domains/transcription factors:\nResponse elements.\nThe DNA sequence that a transcription factor binds to is called a transcription factor-binding site or response element.\nTranscription factors interact with their binding sites using a combination of electrostatic (of which hydrogen bonds are a special case) and Van der Waals forces. Due to the nature of these chemical interactions, most transcription factors bind DNA in a sequence specific manner. However, not all bases in the transcription factor-binding site may actually interact with the transcription factor. In addition, some of these interactions may be weaker than others. Thus, transcription factors do not bind just one sequence but are capable of binding a subset of closely related sequences, each with a different strength of interaction.\nFor example, although the consensus binding site for the TATA-binding protein (TBP) is TATAAAA, the TBP transcription factor can also bind similar sequences such as TATATAT or TATATAA.\nBecause transcription factors can bind a set of related sequences and these sequences tend to be short, potential transcription factor binding sites can occur by chance if the DNA sequence is long enough. It is unlikely, however, that a transcription factor will bind all compatible sequences in the genome of the cell. Other constraints, such as DNA accessibility in the cell or availability of cofactors may also help dictate where a transcription factor will actually bind. Thus, given the genome sequence, it is still difficult to predict where a transcription factor will actually bind in a living cell.\nAdditional recognition specificity, however, may be obtained through the use of more than one DNA-binding domain (for example tandem DBDs in the same transcription factor or through dimerization of two transcription factors) that bind to two or more adjacent sequences of DNA.\nClinical significance.\nTranscription factors are of clinical significance for at least two reasons: (1) mutations can be associated with specific diseases, and (2) they can be targets of medications.\nDisorders.\nDue to their important roles in development, intercellular signaling, and cell cycle, some human diseases have been associated with mutations in transcription factors.\nMany transcription factors are either tumor suppressors or oncogenes, and, thus, mutations or aberrant regulation of them is associated with cancer. Three groups of transcription factors are known to be important in human cancer: (1) the NF-kappaB and AP-1 families, (2) the STAT family and (3) the steroid receptors.\nBelow are a few of the better-studied examples:\nPotential drug targets.\nApproximately 10% of currently prescribed drugs directly target the nuclear receptor class of transcription factors. Examples include tamoxifen and bicalutamide for the treatment of breast and prostate cancer, respectively, and various types of anti-inflammatory and anabolic steroids. In addition, transcription factors are often indirectly modulated by drugs through signaling cascades. It might be possible to directly target other less-explored transcription factors such as NF-\u03baB with drugs. Transcription factors outside the nuclear receptor family are thought to be more difficult to target with small molecule therapeutics since it is not clear that they are \"drugable\" but progress has been made on Pax2 and the notch pathway.\nRole in evolution.\nGene duplications have played a crucial role in the evolution of species. This applies particularly to transcription factors. Once they occur as duplicates, accumulated mutations encoding for one copy can take place without negatively affecting the regulation of downstream targets. However, changes of the DNA binding specificities of the single-copy Leafy transcription factor, which occurs in most land plants, have recently been elucidated. In that respect, a single-copy transcription factor can undergo a change of specificity through a promiscuous intermediate without losing function. Similar mechanisms have been proposed in the context of all alternative phylogenetic hypotheses, and the role of transcription factors in the evolution of all species.\nRole in biocontrol activity.\nThe transcription factors have a role in resistance activity which is important for successful biocontrol activity. The resistant to oxidative stress and alkaline pH sensing were contributed from the transcription factor Yap1 and Rim101 of the \"Papiliotrema terrestris\" LS28 as molecular tools revealed an understanding of the genetic mechanisms underlying the biocontrol activity which supports disease management programs based on biological and integrated control.\nAnalysis.\nThere are different technologies available to analyze transcription factors. On the genomic level, DNA-sequencing and database research are commonly used. The protein version of the transcription factor is detectable by using specific antibodies. The sample is detected on a western blot. By using electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA), the activation profile of transcription factors can be detected. A multiplex approach for activation profiling is a TF chip system where several different transcription factors can be detected in parallel.\nThe most commonly used method for identifying transcription factor binding sites is chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP). This technique relies on chemical fixation of chromatin with formaldehyde, followed by co-precipitation of DNA and the transcription factor of interest using an antibody that specifically targets that protein. The DNA sequences can then be identified by microarray or high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq) to determine transcription factor binding sites. If no antibody is available for the protein of interest, DamID may be a convenient alternative.\nClasses.\nAs described in more detail below, transcription factors may be classified by their (1) mechanism of action, (2) regulatory function, or (3) sequence homology (and hence structural similarity) in their DNA-binding domains. They are also classified by 3D structure of their DBD and the way it contacts DNA.\nMechanistic.\nThere are two mechanistic classes of transcription factors:\nFunctional.\nTranscription factors have been classified according to their regulatory function:\nStructural.\nTranscription factors are often classified based on the sequence similarity and hence the tertiary structure of their DNA-binding domains. The following classification is based on the 3D structure of their DBD and the way it contacts DNA. It was first developed for Human TF and later extended to rodents and also to plants. \nTranscription factor databases.\nThere are numerous databases cataloging information about transcription factors, but their scope and utility vary dramatically. Some may contain only information about the actual proteins, some about their binding sites, or about their target genes. Examples include the following:\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

A minor constituent of opium, thebaine is chemically similar to both morphine and codeine, but has stimulatory rather than depressant effects. At high doses, it causes convulsions similar to strychnine poisoning. The synthetic enantiomer (+)-thebaine does show analgesic effects apparently mediated through opioid receptors, unlike the inactive natural enantiomer (\u2212)-thebaine. While thebaine is not used therapeutically, it is the main alkaloid extracted from \"Papaver bracteatum\" (Iranian opium / Persian poppy) and can be converted industrially into a variety of compounds, including hydrocodone, hydromorphone, oxycodone, oxymorphone, nalbuphine, naloxone, naltrexone, buprenorphine, butorphanol and etorphine.\nThebaine is controlled under international law, is listed as a Class A drug under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 in the United Kingdom, is controlled as an analog of a Schedule II drug per the Analog Act in the United States, and is controlled with its derivatives and salts, as a Schedule I substance of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act in Canada. The 2013 US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) aggregate manufacturing quota for thebaine (ACSCN 9333) was unchanged from the previous year at 145 metric tons.\nThis alkaloid is biosynthetically related to salutaridine, oripavine, morphine and reticuline.\nIn 2012, 146,000 kilograms of thebaine were produced.

They have been characterized as philosophies.\nTheosophy is considered part of Western esotericism, which believes that hidden knowledge or wisdom from the ancient past offers a path to illumination and salvation.\nWhile general theosophy concerns the universal aspects of diverse esoteric traditions, including Hinduism and Buddhism, Christian theosophy is limited to Jewish and Christian elements. The founding of Christian theosophy is usually attributed to the German philosopher Jakob B\u00f6hme. Jewish Kabbalah was also formative for Christian theosophy from B\u00f6hme on.\nIn 1875, the term \"theosophy\" was revived by the Theosophical Society, an esoteric organization led by Helena Petrovna Blavatsky. Theosophy. In the 20th century, theosophy became the object of study for various scholars of Western esotericism.\nEtymology and terminology.\nTheosophy comes from the Greek ' (), which combines ' (\u03b8\u03b5\u03cc\u03c2), \"God\" and \"\" (), \"wisdom\". Its etymological meaning is thus \"wisdom of God.\"\nThe term \"theosophia\" appeared (in both Greek and Latin) in the works of early Church Fathers, as a synonym for theology: the \"theosophoi\" are \"those knowing divine things\". The term however acquired various other meanings throughout its history. The adjective \"theosophos\" (\u03b8\u03b5\u03cc\u03c3\u03bf\u03c6\u03bf\u03c2) \"wise in divine things\" was applied by Iamblichus to the gymnosophists (\u0393\u03c5\u03bc\u03bd\u03bf\u03c3\u03bf\u03c6\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03b1\u03af), i.e. the Indian yogis or sadhus.\nScholars of esotericism such as Godwin and Faivre differentiated the tradition of religious illumination from the religious system established in the late nineteenth century by Helena Blavatsky by referring to the latter with a capital letter as Theosophy, and the former with a lower-case letter as theosophy. Followers of Blavatsky's movement are known as Theosophists, while adherents of the older tradition are termed theosophers. Several Theosophists \u2014 such as C. C. Massey and Franz Hartmann \u2014 were also theosophers.\nAntoine Faivre suggested in 1998 that it be called \"Boehmian theosophy\", although he himself more often uses the term Christian theosophy.\nThe term theosophy was used as a synonym for theology as early as the 3rd century CE. The 13th-century work \"Summa philosophiae\" attributed to Robert Grosseteste made a distinction between theosophers and theologians. In the \"Summa\", theosophers were described as authors only inspired by the holy books, while theologians like Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite and Origen were described as those whose task was to explain theosophy. Therefore, the terms denoted the opposite of the present-day meaning.\nDuring the Renaissance, use of the term diverged to refer to gnostic knowledge that offers the individual enlightenment and salvation through a knowledge of the bonds that are believed to unite her or him to the world of divine or intermediary spirits. Christian theosophy arose in Germany in the 16th century. Inspired to a considerable extent by the works of Paracelsus (1493\u20131541). The term had not yet reached a settled meaning, however, as the mid-16th century \"Theosophia\" by Johannes Arboreus provided a lengthy exposition that included no mention of esotericism.\nHistorical development.\nIn the 17th and 18th centuries, Christian theosophy and Pietism arose in response to the orthodoxy of the Lutheran Reformation.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nI do not write in the pagan manner, but in the theosophical.\n\u2014 Jakob B\u00f6hme\nThe work of the 17th-century German Christian mystic Jakob B\u00f6hme (1575\u20131624) strongly contributed to spread the use of the word \"theosophy\", even though B\u00f6hme rarely used the word in his writings. It is on account of the title of some of his works, but these titles appear to have been chosen more by the editors than by B\u00f6hme himself. Moreover, B\u00f6hme gave the word \"theosophy\" a limited meaning, making it clear that he was not conflating nature with God. B\u00f6hme's work has been described as being \"foundational\" for Christian theosophy. There were relatively few theosophers in the 17th century, but many of them were prolific. Outside of Germany, there were also theosophers from Holland, England, and France. This group is represented by Jan Baptist van Helmont (1618\u20131699), Robert Fludd (1574\u20131637), John Pordage (1608\u20131681), Jane Leade (1623\u20131704), Henry More (1614\u20131687), Pierre Poiret (1646\u20131719), and Antoinette Bourignon (1616\u20131680). Theosophers of this period often inquired into nature using a method of interpretation founded upon a specific myth or revelation, applying active imagination in order to draw forth symbolic meanings and further their pursuit of knowledge toward a complete understanding of these mysteries. In Athanasius Kircher's \"Oedipus Aegyptiacus\" (1652), Kircher assigned the word theosophy to the metaphysics adhered to in ancient Egypt, and to Neo-Platonism, and thus he gave once again the word one of its most generally accepted meanings, that of divine metaphysics.\nIn the 18th century, the word theosophy came into more widespread use among some philosophers. However, the term \"theosophy\" was still \"practically absent\" throughout the entire eighteenth century in dictionaries and encyclopedias, where it only appeared more and more frequently beginning in the second half of the nineteenth century. Theosophers themselves used the word theosophy sparingly, at least up until the middle of the nineteenth century. Johann Jakob Brucker (1696\u20131770) included a long chapter on theosophy in his monumental work (1741). He included theosophers alongside other currents in esotericism in what was then a standard reference in the history of philosophy. By the 18th century, the word \"theosophy\" was often used in conjunction with pansophy. The term \"theosophy\" is more properly reserved for the reverse process of contemplating the divine in order to discover the content of the concrete universe.\nIn England, Robert Hindmarsh, a printer with a Methodist background, formed a \"Theosophical Society\" in 1783, for translating, printing and distributing the writings of Swedenborg. This society was renamed in 1785 as \"The British Society for the Propagation of the Doctrines of the New Church\", consisting of Swedenborgian based beliefs. In France, Denis Diderot gave the word \"\" more attention than other encyclopedias of this period by including an article on it in his \"Encyclop\u00e9die\", published during the French Enlightenment. The article dealt mostly with Paracelsus and essentially plagiarized Brucker's \"Historia\".\nGroups such as the Martinist Order founded by Papus in 1891, followed the theosophical current closely linked to the Judeo-Christian-Islamic tradition and Western esotericism. Theosophers outside of the initiate societies included people such as Vladimir Solovyov (1853\u20131900), whose views have been described as follows: \"although empiricism and rationalism rest on false principles, their respective objective contents, external experience, qua the foundation of natural science, and logical thought, qua the foundation of pure philosophy, are to be synthesized or encompassed along with mystical knowledge in 'integral knowledge,' what Solovyov terms 'theosophy.'\"\nCommon characteristics.\nFaivre stated that \"Theosophy is a gnosis that has a bearing not only on the salvific relations the individual maintains with the divine world, but also on the nature of God Himself, or of divine persons, and on the natural universe, the origin of that universe, the hidden structures that constitute it in its actual state, its relationship to mankind, and its final ends.\"\nTheosophy actually designates a specific flow of thought or tradition within the modern study of esotericism. Thus, it follows the path starting from the more modern period of the 15th century onward. Faivre describes the \"theosophic current\" or theosophy as a single esoteric current among seven other esoteric currents in early modern Western thought (i.e., alchemy, astrology, Neo-Alexandrian Hermeticism, Christian Kabbalah, Paracelsism\u2014that is, the studying of the \"prognostications\" of Paracelsus\u2014philosophia occulta and Rosicrucianism).\nFaivre noted that there are \"obvious similarities\" between earlier theosophy and modern Theosophy as both play an important part in Western esotericism and both claim to deal with wisdom from a gnostic perspective. But he says there are also differences, since they do not actually rely on the same reference works; and their style is different. The referential corpus of earlier theosophy \"belongs essentially to the Judeo-Christian type\", while that of modern Theosophy \"reveals a more universal aspect\". Although there are many differences between Christian theosophy and the Theosophical movement begun by Helena Blavatsky, the differences \"are not important enough to cause an insurmountable barrier\". Theosophists like Blavatsky and W.Q. Judge wrote about Jakob B\u00f6hme's philosophy. B\u00f6hme was also an important influence on the ideas of Franz Hartmann, the founder in 1886 of the German branch of the Theosophical Society. Hartmann described the writings of B\u00f6hme as \u201cthe most valuable and useful treasure in spiritual literature.\u201d\nTheosophers engage in analysis of the universe, humanity, divinity, and the reciprocal effects of each on the other. Their departure point therefore may be knowledge of external things in the world or inner experiences, and the theosopher's aim is to discover deeper meanings in the natural or divine realm. Antoine Faivre notes, \"the theosophist dedicates his energy to inventing (in the word's original sense of 'discovering') the articulation of all things visible and invisible, by examining both divinity and nature in the smallest detail.\" The knowledge that is acquired through meditation is believed to change the being of the meditator.\nFaivre identified three characteristics of theosophy. The three characteristics of theosophy are listed below.\n\"Theosophy\":\nLegacy and reception.\nThe scholar of esotericism Wouter Hanegraaff described Christian theosophy as \"one of the major currents in the history of Western esotericism\".\nChristian theosophy is an under-researched area; a general history of it has never been written. The French scholar Antoine Faivre had a specific interest in the theosophers and illuminists of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. He wrote his doctoral thesis on Karl von Eckartshausen and Christian theosophy.\nScholars of esotericism have argued that Faivre's definition of Western esotericism relies on his own specialist focus on Christian theosophy, Renaissance Hermeticism, and Romantic \"Naturphilosophie\" and therefore creates an \"ideal\" type of esotericism that does not suit all esoteric currents.\nReferences.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nWorks cited.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Leibniz defined it as the line through a pair of infinitely close points on the curve. More precisely, a straight line is tangent to the curve \"y\" \n \"f\"(\"x\") at a point \"x\" \n \"c\" if the line passes through the point (\"c\", \"f\"(\"c\")) on the curve and has slope \"f\"'(\"c\"), where \"f\"' is the derivative of \"f\". A similar definition applies to space curves and curves in \"n\"-dimensional Euclidean space.\nThe point where the tangent line and the curve meet or intersect is called the point of tangency. The tangent line is said to be \"going in the same direction\" as the curve, and is thus the best straight-line approximation to the curve at that point.\nThe tangent line to a point on a differentiable curve can also be thought of as a \"tangent line approximation\", the graph of the affine function that best approximates the original function at the given point. \nSimilarly, the tangent plane to a surface at a given point is the plane that \"just touches\" the surface at that point. The concept of a tangent is one of the most fundamental notions in differential geometry and has been extensively generalized; &lt;templatestyles src=\"Crossreference/styles.css\" /&gt;.\nThe word \"tangent\" comes from the Latin , \"to touch\".\nHistory.\nEuclid makes several references to the tangent ( \"ephaptom\u00e9n\u0113\") to a circle in book III of the \"Elements\" (c. 300 BC). In Apollonius' work \"Conics\" (c. 225 BC) he defines a tangent as being \"a line such that no other straight line could fall between it and the curve\".\nArchimedes (c.\u2009 287 \u2013 c. \u2009212 BC) found the tangent to an Archimedean spiral by considering the path of a point moving along the curve.\nIn the 1630s Fermat developed the technique of adequality to calculate tangents and other problems in analysis and used this to calculate tangents to the parabola. The technique of adequality is similar to taking the difference between formula_1 and formula_2 and dividing by a power of formula_3. Independently Descartes used his method of normals based on the observation that the radius of a circle is always normal to the circle itself.\nThese methods led to the development of differential calculus in the 17th century. Many people contributed. Roberval discovered a general method of drawing tangents, by considering a curve as described by a moving point whose motion is the resultant of several simpler motions.\nRen\u00e9-Fran\u00e7ois de Sluse and Johannes Hudde found algebraic algorithms for finding tangents. Further developments included those of John Wallis and Isaac Barrow, leading to the theory of Isaac Newton and Gottfried Leibniz.\nAn 1828 definition of a tangent was \"a right line which touches a curve, but which when produced, does not cut it\". This old definition prevents inflection points from having any tangent. It has been dismissed and the modern definitions are equivalent to those of Leibniz, who defined the tangent line as the line through a pair of infinitely close points on the curve; in modern terminology, this is expressed as: the tangent to a curve at a point P on the curve is the limit of the line passing through two points of the curve when these two points tends to P.\nTangent line to a plane curve.\nThe intuitive notion that a tangent line \"touches\" a curve can be made more explicit by considering the sequence of straight lines (secant lines) passing through two points, \"A\" and \"B\", those that lie on the function curve. The tangent at \"A\" is the limit when point \"B\" approximates or tends to \"A\". The existence and uniqueness of the tangent line depends on a certain type of mathematical smoothness, known as \"differentiability.\" For example, if two circular arcs meet at a sharp point (a vertex) then there is no uniquely defined tangent at the vertex because the limit of the progression of secant lines depends on the direction in which \"point \"B\"\" approaches the vertex.\nAt most points, the tangent touches the curve without crossing it (though it may, when continued, cross the curve at other places away from the point of tangent). A point where the tangent (at this point) crosses the curve is called an \"inflection point\". Circles, parabolas, hyperbolas and ellipses do not have any inflection point, but more complicated curves do have, like the graph of a cubic function, which has exactly one inflection point, or a sinusoid, which has two inflection points per each period of the sine.\nConversely, it may happen that the curve lies entirely on one side of a straight line passing through a point on it, and yet this straight line is not a tangent line. This is the case, for example, for a line passing through the vertex of a triangle and not intersecting it otherwise\u2014where the tangent line does not exist for the reasons explained above. In convex geometry, such lines are called supporting lines.\nAnalytical approach.\nThe geometrical idea of the tangent line as the limit of secant lines serves as the motivation for analytical methods that are used to find tangent lines explicitly. The question of finding the tangent line to a graph, or the tangent line problem, was one of the central questions leading to the development of calculus in the 17th century. In the second book of his \"Geometry\", Ren\u00e9 Descartes of the problem of constructing the tangent to a curve, \"And I dare say that this is not only the most useful and most general problem in geometry that I know, but even that I have ever desired to know\".\nIntuitive description.\nSuppose that a curve is given as the graph of a function, \"y\" = \"f\"(\"x\"). To find the tangent line at the point \"p\" = (\"a\", \"f\"(\"a\")), consider another nearby point \"q\" = (\"a\" + \"h\", \"f\"(\"a\" + \"h\")) on the curve. The slope of the secant line passing through \"p\" and \"q\" is equal to the difference quotient\nformula_4\nAs the point \"q\" approaches \"p\", which corresponds to making \"h\" smaller and smaller, the difference quotient should approach a certain limiting value \"k\", which is the slope of the tangent line at the point \"p\". If \"k\" is known, the equation of the tangent line can be found in the point-slope form:\nformula_5\nMore rigorous description.\nTo make the preceding reasoning rigorous, one has to explain what is meant by the difference quotient approaching a certain limiting value \"k\". The precise mathematical formulation was given by Cauchy in the 19th century and is based on the notion of limit. Suppose that the graph does not have a break or a sharp edge at \"p\" and it is neither plumb nor too wiggly near \"p\". Then there is a unique value of \"k\" such that, as \"h\" approaches 0, the difference quotient gets closer and closer to \"k\", and the distance between them becomes negligible compared with the size of \"h\", if \"h\" is small enough. This leads to the definition of the slope of the tangent line to the graph as the limit of the difference quotients for the function \"f\". This limit is the derivative of the function \"f\" at \"x\" = \"a\", denoted \"f\"\u00a0\u2032(\"a\"). Using derivatives, the equation of the tangent line can be stated as follows:\n formula_6\nCalculus provides rules for computing the derivatives of functions that are given by formulas, such as the power function, trigonometric functions, exponential function, logarithm, and their various combinations. Thus, equations of the tangents to graphs of all these functions, as well as many others, can be found by the methods of calculus.\nHow the method can fail.\nCalculus also demonstrates that there are functions and points on their graphs for which the limit determining the slope of the tangent line does not exist. For these points the function \"f\" is \"non-differentiable\". There are two possible reasons for the method of finding the tangents based on the limits and derivatives to fail: either the geometric tangent exists, but it is a vertical line, which cannot be given in the point-slope form since it does not have a slope, or the graph exhibits one of three behaviors that precludes a geometric tangent.\nThe graph \"y\" = \"x\"1/3 illustrates the first possibility: here the difference quotient at \"a\" = 0 is equal to \"h\"1/3/\"h\" = \"h\"\u22122/3, which becomes very large as \"h\" approaches 0. This curve has a tangent line at the origin that is vertical.\nThe graph \"y\" = \"x\"2/3 illustrates another possibility: this graph has a \"cusp\" at the origin. This means that, when \"h\" approaches 0, the difference quotient at \"a\" = 0 approaches plus or minus infinity depending on the sign of \"x\". Thus both branches of the curve are near to the half vertical line for which \"y\"=0, but none is near to the negative part of this line. Basically, there is no tangent at the origin in this case, but in some context one may consider this line as a tangent, and even, in algebraic geometry, as a \"double tangent\".\nThe graph \"y\" = |\"x\"| of the absolute value function consists of two straight lines with different slopes joined at the origin. As a point \"q\" approaches the origin from the right, the secant line always has slope 1. As a point \"q\" approaches the origin from the left, the secant line always has slope \u22121. Therefore, there is no unique tangent to the graph at the origin. Having two different (but finite) slopes is called a \"corner\".\nFinally, since differentiability implies continuity, the contrapositive states \"discontinuity\" implies non-differentiability. Any such jump or point discontinuity will have no tangent line. This includes cases where one slope approaches positive infinity while the other approaches negative infinity, leading to an infinite jump discontinuity\nEquations.\nWhen the curve is given by \"y\" = \"f\"(\"x\") then the slope of the tangent is formula_7\nso by the point\u2013slope formula the equation of the tangent line at (\"X\",\u00a0\"Y\") is\nformula_8\nwhere (\"x\",\u00a0\"y\") are the coordinates of any point on the tangent line, and where the derivative is evaluated at formula_9.\nWhen the curve is given by \"y\" = \"f\"(\"x\"), the tangent line's equation can also be found by using polynomial division to divide formula_10 by formula_11; if the remainder is denoted by formula_12, then the equation of the tangent line is given by\nformula_13\nWhen the equation of the curve is given in the form \"f\"(\"x\",\u00a0\"y\") = 0 then the value of the slope can be found by implicit differentiation, giving\nformula_14\nThe equation of the tangent line at a point (\"X\",\"Y\") such that \"f\"(\"X\",\"Y\") = 0 is then\nformula_15\nThis equation remains true if\nformula_16\nin which case the slope of the tangent is infinite. If, however,\nformula_17\nthe tangent line is not defined and the point (\"X\",\"Y\") is said to be singular.\nFor algebraic curves, computations may be simplified somewhat by converting to homogeneous coordinates. Specifically, let the homogeneous equation of the curve be \"g\"(\"x\",\u00a0\"y\",\u00a0\"z\") = 0 where \"g\" is a homogeneous function of degree \"n\". Then, if (\"X\",\u00a0\"Y\",\u00a0\"Z\") lies on the curve, Euler's theorem implies\nformula_18\nIt follows that the homogeneous equation of the tangent line is\nformula_19\nThe equation of the tangent line in Cartesian coordinates can be found by setting \"z\"=1 in this equation.\nTo apply this to algebraic curves, write \"f\"(\"x\",\u00a0\"y\") as\nformula_20\nwhere each \"u\"\"r\" is the sum of all terms of degree \"r\". The homogeneous equation of the curve is then\nformula_21\nApplying the equation above and setting \"z\"=1 produces\nformula_22\nas the equation of the tangent line. The equation in this form is often simpler to use in practice since no further simplification is needed after it is applied.\nIf the curve is given parametrically by\nformula_23\nthen the slope of the tangent is\nformula_24\ngiving the equation for the tangent line at formula_25 as\nformula_26\nIf \nformula_27\nthe tangent line is not defined. However, it may occur that the tangent line exists and may be computed from an implicit equation of the curve.\nNormal line to a curve.\nThe line perpendicular to the tangent line to a curve at the point of tangency is called the \"normal line\" to the curve at that point. The slopes of perpendicular lines have product \u22121, so if the equation of the curve is \"y\" = \"f\"(\"x\") then slope of the normal line is\nformula_28\nand it follows that the equation of the normal line at (X, Y) is\nformula_29\nSimilarly, if the equation of the curve has the form \"f\"(\"x\",\u00a0\"y\") = 0 then the equation of the normal line is given by\nformula_30\nIf the curve is given parametrically by\nformula_23\nthen the equation of the normal line is\nformula_32\nAngle between curves.\nThe angle between two curves at a point where they intersect is defined as the angle between their tangent lines at that point. More specifically, two curves are said to be tangent at a point if they have the same tangent at a point, and orthogonal if their tangent lines are orthogonal.\nMultiple tangents at a point.\nThe formulas above fail when the point is a singular point. In this case there may be two or more branches of the curve that pass through the point, each branch having its own tangent line. When the point is the origin, the equations of these lines can be found for algebraic curves by factoring the equation formed by eliminating all but the lowest degree terms from the original equation. Since any point can be made the origin by a change of variables (or by translating the curve) this gives a method for finding the tangent lines at any singular point.\nFor example, the equation of the lima\u00e7on trisectrix shown to the right is\nformula_33\nExpanding this and eliminating all but terms of degree 2 gives\nformula_34\nwhich, when factored, becomes\nformula_35\nSo these are the equations of the two tangent lines through the origin.\nWhen the curve is not self-crossing, the tangent at a reference point may still not be uniquely defined because the curve is not differentiable at that point although it is differentiable elsewhere. In this case the left and right derivatives are defined as the limits of the derivative as the point at which it is evaluated approaches the reference point from respectively the left (lower values) or the right (higher values). For example, the curve \"y\" = |\"x\" | is not differentiable at \"x\" = 0: its left and right derivatives have respective slopes \u22121 and 1; the tangents at that point with those slopes are called the left and right tangents.\nSometimes the slopes of the left and right tangent lines are equal, so the tangent lines coincide. This is true, for example, for the curve \"y\" = \"x\" 2/3, for which both the left and right derivatives at \"x\" = 0 are infinite; both the left and right tangent lines have equation \"x\" = 0.\nTangent circles.\nTwo distinct circles lying in the same plane are said to be \"tangent\" to each other if they meet at exactly one point.\nIf points in the plane are described using Cartesian coordinates, then two circles, with radii formula_36 and centers formula_37 and formula_38 are tangent to each other whenever\nformula_39\nThe two circles are called \"externally tangent\" if the distance between their centres is equal to the sum of their radii,\nformula_40\nor \"internally tangent\" if the distance between their centres is equal to the difference between their radii:\nformula_41\nTangent plane to a surface.\nThe tangent plane to a surface at a given point \"p\" is defined in an analogous way to the tangent line in the case of curves. It is the best approximation of the surface by a plane at \"p\", and can be obtained as the limiting position of the planes passing through 3 distinct points on the surface close to \"p\" as these points converge to \"p\". (A technical detail is that the three points must approach \"p\" from at least two non-parallel directions. More precisely, two of the three tangent vectors at \"p\" must be linearly independent.) Mathematically, if the surface is given by a function formula_42, the equation of the tangent plane at point formula_43 can be expressed as:\nformula_44\nHere, formula_45 and formula_46 are the partial derivatives of the function formula_47 with respect to formula_48 and formula_49 respectively, evaluated at the point formula_50. In essence, the tangent plane captures the local behavior of the surface at the specific point \"p\". It's a fundamental concept used in calculus and differential geometry, crucial for understanding how functions change locally on surfaces.\nHigher-dimensional manifolds.\nMore generally, there is a \"k\"-dimensional tangent space at each point of a \"k\"-dimensional manifold in the \"n\"-dimensional Euclidean space.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He played a prominent role in nearly all military engagements in the eastern theater of the war until his death. Military historians regard him as one of the most gifted tactical commanders in U.S. history.\nBorn in what was then part of Virginia (now in West Virginia), Jackson received an appointment to the United States Military Academy, graduating in the class of 1846. He served in the United States Army during the Mexican\u2013American War, distinguishing himself at the Battle of Chapultepec. From 1851 to 1861, he taught at the Virginia Military Institute.\nWhen Virginia seceded from the United States in May 1861 after the Battle of Fort Sumter, Jackson joined the Confederate States Army. He distinguished himself commanding a brigade at the First Battle of Bull Run in July, providing crucial reinforcements and beating back a fierce Union assault. Thus Barnard E. Bee compared him to a \"stone wall\", which became his enduring nickname.\nJackson performed exceptionally well in various campaigns over the next two years. On May 2, 1863, he was accidentally shot by Confederate pickets. He lost his left arm to amputation. Weakened by his wounds, he died of pneumonia eight days later. Jackson's death proved a severe setback for the Confederacy. After his death, his military exploits developed a legendary quality, becoming an important element of the pseudohistorical ideology of the \"Lost Cause\".\nAncestry.\nThomas Jonathan Jackson was a great-grandson of John Jackson (1715/1719\u20131801) and Elizabeth Cummins (also known as Elizabeth Comings and Elizabeth Needles) (1723\u20131828). John Jackson was an Ulster-Scots Protestant from Coleraine, County Londonderry, in the north of Ireland. While living in London, England, he was convicted of the capital crime of larceny for stealing ); the judge at the Old Bailey sentenced him to seven years penal transportation. Elizabeth, a strong, blonde woman almost tall, born in London, was also convicted of felony larceny in an unrelated case for stealing 19 pieces of silver, jewelry, and fine lace, and received a similar sentence. They both were transported on the merchant ship \"Litchfield\", which departed London in May 1749 with 150 convicts. John and Elizabeth met on board and were in love by the time the ship arrived at Annapolis, Maryland. Although they were sent to different locations in Maryland for their bond service, the couple married in July 1755.\nThe family migrated west across the Blue Ridge Mountains to settle near Moorefield, Virginia (now West Virginia) in 1758. In 1770, they moved farther west to the Tygart Valley. They began to acquire large parcels of virgin farming land near the present-day town of Buckhannon, including 3,000 acres (12\u00a0km2) in Elizabeth's name. John and his two teenage sons were early recruits for the American Revolutionary War, fighting in the Battle of Kings Mountain on October 7, 1780; John finished the war as captain and served as a lieutenant of the Virginia militia after 1787. While the men were in the Army, Elizabeth converted their home to a haven, \"Jackson's Fort\", for refugees from Indian attacks.\nJohn and Elizabeth had eight children. Their second son was Edward Jackson (1759\u20131828), and Edward's third son was Jonathan Jackson, Thomas's father. Jonathan's mother died on April 17, 1796. Three years later, on October 13, 1799, his father married Elizabeth Wetherholt, and they had nine more children.\nEarly life.\nEarly childhood.\nThomas Jackson was born in the town of Clarksburg, Harrison County, Virginia, on January 21, 1824. He was the third child of Julia Beckwith (n\u00e9e Neale) Jackson (1798\u20131831) and Jonathan Jackson (1790\u20131826), an attorney. Both of Jackson's parents were natives of Virginia. The family already had two young children and were living in Clarksburg, in what is now West Virginia, when Thomas was born. He was named for his maternal grandfather. There is some dispute about the actual location of Jackson's birth. A historical marker on the floodwall in Parkersburg, West Virginia, claims that he was born in a cabin near that spot when his mother was visiting her parents who lived there. There are writings which indicate that in Jackson's early childhood, he was called \"The Real Macaroni\", though the origin of the nickname and whether it really existed are unclear.\nThomas's sister Elizabeth (age six) died of typhoid fever on March 6, 1826, with two-year-old Thomas at her bedside. His father also died of typhoid fever on March 26, 1827, after nursing his daughter. Jackson's mother gave birth to his sister Laura Ann the day after Jackson's father died. Julia Jackson thus was widowed at 28 and was left with much debt and three young children (including the newborn). She sold the family's possessions to pay the debts. She declined family charity and moved into a small rented one-room house. Julia took in sewing and opened a private school to support herself and her three young children for about four years.\nIn 1830, Julia Neale Jackson remarried, against the wishes of her friends. Her new husband, Captain Blake B. Woodson, an attorney, did not like his stepchildren. Warren, Julia's eldest son, moved to live with his uncle Alfred Neale near Parkersburg, and at the age of sixteen, he was hired to teach in Upshur County. Julia moved to Fayette County with her other two children, Thomas and Laura. Julia remained in such poor health, and caring for the children was such a strain on her strength, that she agreed to let their Grandmother Jackson take them to her home in Lewis County, about four miles north of Weston, where she lived with her unmarried daughters and sons. One of these sons was sent to Fayette County to care for the children by the grandmother. When he arrived and the purpose of his visit was revealed, there was quite a commotion among the children, who were very reluctant to leave their mother. Thomas, now six years old, slipped away to the nearby woods, where he hid, only returning to the house at nightfall. After a day or two of coaxing and numerous bribes, the uncle finally persuaded the children to make the trip, which took several days, with the help of their mother. When they arrived at their destination, they became the pets of an indulgent grandmother, two maiden aunts, and several bachelor uncles, all of whom were known for their great kindness of heart and strong family attachment. Thomas and Laura were indulged in every way, and to an extent well calculated to spoil them. In August 1835, Thomas and Laura's grandmother died.\nThe following year, after giving birth to Thomas's half-brother Willam Wirt Woodson, Julia died of complications, leaving her three older children orphaned. Julia was buried in an unmarked grave in a homemade coffin in Westlake Cemetery along the James River and Kanawha Turnpike in Fayette County within the corporate limits of present-day Ansted, West Virginia.\nWorking and teaching at Jackson's Mill.\nAs their mother's health continued to fail, Jackson and his sister Laura Ann were sent to live with their half-uncle, Cummins Jackson, who owned a grist mill in Jackson's Mill (near present-day Weston in Lewis County in central West Virginia). Their older brother, Warren, went to live with other relatives on his mother's side of the family, but he later died of tuberculosis in 1841 at the age of twenty. Thomas and Laura Ann returned from Jackson's Mill in November 1831 to be at their dying mother's bedside. They spent four years together at the Mill before being separated\u2014Laura Ann was sent to live with her mother's family, Thomas to live with his Aunt Polly (his father's sister) and her husband, Isaac Brake, on a farm four miles from Clarksburg. Thomas was treated by Brake as an outsider and, having suffered verbal abuse for over a year, ran away from the family. When his cousin in Clarksburg urged him to return to Aunt Polly's, he replied, \"Maybe I ought to, ma'am, but I am not going to.\" He walked eighteen miles through mountain wilderness to Jackson's Mill, where he was welcomed by his uncles and he remained there for the following seven years.\nCummins Jackson was strict with Thomas, who looked up to Cummins as a schoolteacher. Jackson helped around the farm, tending sheep with the assistance of a sheepdog, driving teams of oxen and helping harvest wheat and corn. Formal education was not easily obtained, but he attended school when and where he could. Much of Jackson's education was self-taught. He once made a deal with one of his uncle's slaves to provide him with pine knots in exchange for reading lessons; Thomas would stay up at night reading borrowed books by the light of those burning pine knots. Virginia law forbade teaching a slave, free black or mulatto to read or write; nevertheless, Jackson secretly taught the slave, as he had promised. Once literate, the young slave fled to Canada via the Underground Railroad. In his later years at Jackson's Mill, Thomas served as a schoolteacher.\nBrother against sister.\nThe Civil War has sometimes been referred to as a war of \"brother against brother\", but in the case of the Jackson family, it was brother against sister. Laura Jackson Arnold was close to her brother Thomas until the Civil War period. As the war loomed, she became a staunch Unionist in a somewhat divided Harrison County. She was so strident in her beliefs that she expressed mixed feelings upon hearing of Thomas's death. One Union officer said that she seemed depressed at hearing the news, but her Unionism was stronger than her family bonds. In a letter, he wrote that Laura had said that she \"would rather know that he was dead than to have him a leader in the rebel army\". Her Union sentiment also estranged her later from her husband, Jonathan Arnold.\nEarly military career.\nWest Point.\nIn 1842, Jackson was accepted to the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York. Because of his inadequate schooling, he had difficulty with the entrance examinations and began his studies at the bottom of his class. Displaying a dogged determination that was to characterize his life, he became one of the hardest working cadets in the academy, and moved steadily up the academic rankings. Jackson graduated 17th out of 59 students in the Class of 1846. General Daniel Harvey Hill later remembered that Jackson's peers at West Point had said of Jackson, \"If the course had been one year longer he would have graduated at the head of his class\".\nU.S. Army and the Mexican War.\nJackson began his United States Army career as a second lieutenant in Company K of the 1st U.S. Artillery Regiment. His unit proceeded through Pennsylvania, down the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers to New Orleans, and from there the troops embarked for Point Isabel, Texas, from where they were sent to fight in the Mexican\u2013American War. Jackson's unit was directed to report to General Taylor and proceed immediately via Matamoros and Camargo to Monterey and then to Saltillo. Prior to the Battle of Buena Vista, Lieutenant Jackson's unit was ordered to withdraw from General Taylor's army and march to the mouth of the Rio Grande, where they would be transferred to Veracruz. He served at the Siege of Veracruz and the battles of Contreras, Chapultepec, and Mexico City, eventually earning two brevet promotions, and the regular army rank of first lieutenant. It was in Mexico that Jackson first met Robert E. Lee.\nDuring the Battle of Chapultepec on September 13, 1847, he refused what he felt was a \"bad order\" to withdraw his troops. Confronted by his superior, he explained his rationale, claiming withdrawal was more hazardous than continuing his overmatched artillery duel. His judgment proved correct, and a relieving brigade was able to exploit the advantage Jackson had broached. In contrast to this display of strength of character, he obeyed what he also felt was a \"bad order\" when he raked a civilian throng with artillery fire after the Mexican authorities failed to surrender Mexico City at the hour demanded by the U.S. forces. The former episode, and later aggressive action against the retreating Mexican army, earned him field promotion to the brevet rank of major.\nAfter the war, Jackson was briefly assigned to units in New York, and later to Florida during the Second Interbellum of the Seminole Wars, during which the Americans were attempting to force the remaining Seminoles to move west. He was stationed briefly at Fort Casey before being named second-in-command at Fort Meade, a small fort about thirty miles south of Tampa. His commanding officer was Major William H. French. Jackson and French disagreed often, and filed numerous complaints against each other. Jackson stayed in Florida less than a year.\nLexington and the Virginia Military Institute.\nIn the spring of 1851, Jackson accepted a newly created teaching position at the Virginia Military Institute (VMI). He became Professor of Natural and Experimental Philosophy, or Physics, and Instructor of Artillery.\nJackson was disliked as a teacher, with his students nicknaming him \"Tom Fool\", believing that Jackson \"could never be anything more than a martinet colonel, half soldier and half preacher\". He memorized his lectures and then recited them to the class. Students who came to ask for help were given the same explanation as before. If a student asked for help a second time, Jackson simply repeated the explanation slower and more deliberately. In 1856, a group of alumni attempted to have Jackson removed from his position.\nThe founder of VMI and one of its first two faculty members was John Thomas Lewis Preston. Preston's second wife, Margaret Junkin Preston, was the sister of Jackson's first wife, Elinor. In addition to working together on the VMI faculty, Preston taught Sunday School with Jackson and served on his staff during the Civil War.\nSlavery.\nJackson was not known to the white inhabitants of Lexington, instead mostly being known by many of the African Americans in town, both slaves and free blacks. In 1855, he organized Sunday School classes for blacks at the Presbyterian Church, as part of a broader program of evangelizing pro-slavery theology to enslaved people following Nat Turner's 1831 rebellion. His second wife, Mary Anna Jackson, taught with Jackson, as \"he preferred that my labors should be given to the colored children, believing that it was more important and useful to put the strong hand of the Gospel under the ignorant African race, to lift them up\". The pastor, Dr. William Spottswood White, described the relationship between Jackson and his Sunday afternoon students: \"In their religious instruction he succeeded wonderfully. His discipline was systematic and firm, but very kind. ... His servants reverenced and loved him, as they would have done a brother or father. ... He was emphatically the black man's friend.\" He addressed his students by name and they referred to him as \"Marse Major\".\nJackson owned six slaves in the late 1850s. Three (Harriet, nicknamed \"Hetty\", and her teenage sons Cyrus and George) were received as part of the dowry at his marriage to Mary Anna Jackson. Another slave, Albert, requested that Jackson purchase him and allow him to work for his freedom; he was employed as a waiter in one of the Lexington hotels and Jackson rented him to VMI between 1858 and 1860. He had likely bought his freedom by 1863. Amy also requested that Jackson purchase her from a public slave auction and she served the family as a cook and housekeeper, before dying in the fall of 1861. The sixth, Emma, was a four-year-old orphan with a learning disability, accepted by Jackson from an aged widow and presented to Anna as a welcome-home gift. After Jackson was shot at Chancellorsville, a slave \"Jim Lewis, had stayed with Jackson in the small house as he lay dying\". Jackson and Anna likely sold two of these slaves in 1857 to pay for a larger house after their wedding. In her 1895 memoir, Anna described Jackson as a master providing \"firm guidance and restraint\", who would \"punish for first offenses\" and \"make such an impression that the offense would not be repeated\". Jackson left few indications of his private views on slavery, but he largely accepted it as a divinely sanctioned institution, and his actions were typical for white slaveowners of his era. \nAfter the outbreak of the Civil War, most white men in Lexington joined the Confederate army, leaving women to manage slave-holding households. This led to greatly increased resistance to enslavement in much of the South, and Anna found the household difficult to control; upon Stonewall's advice, she sold or hired out all of the slaves except Hetty before moving back to Lincoln County, North Carolina. Harriet, George, Cyrus, and Emma eventually settled nearby, with Harriet (later Harriet Graham Jackson) living until 1911 and George (later George Washington Jackson Sr.) dying in 1920. Their descendants continue to reside in Lincoln County. \nIn the Maryland campaign of 1862, Jackson's command captured over 1200 contrabands, or escaped slaves, in Harpers Ferry, forcibly returning them to slaveowners or impressing them as laborers for the Army of Northern Virginia. Southern newspapers reported this as a common practice in Confederate military operations.\nMarriages and family life.\nWhile an instructor at VMI in 1853, Thomas Jackson married Elinor \"Ellie\" Junkin, whose father, George Junkin, was president of Washington College (later named Washington and Lee University) in Lexington. An addition was built onto the president's residence for the Jacksons, and when Robert E. Lee became president of Washington College he lived in the same home, now known as the Lee\u2013Jackson House. Ellie gave birth to a stillborn son on October 22, 1854, experiencing a hemorrhage an hour later that proved fatal.\nAfter a tour of Europe, Jackson married again, in 1857. Mary Anna Morrison was from North Carolina, where her father was the first president of Davidson College. Her sister, Isabella Morrison, was married to Daniel Harvey Hill. Mary Anna had a daughter named Mary Graham on April 30, 1858, but the baby died less than a month later. Another daughter was born in 1862, shortly before her father's death. The Jacksons named her Julia Laura, after his mother and sister.\nJackson purchased the only house he ever owned while in Lexington. Built in 1801, the brick town house at 8 East Washington Street was purchased by Jackson in 1859. He lived in it for two years before being called to serve in the Confederacy. Jackson never returned to his home.\nJohn Brown raid aftermath.\nIn November 1859, at the request of the governor of Virginia, Major William Gilham led a contingent of the VMI Cadet Corps to Charles Town to provide an additional military presence at the hanging of militant abolitionist John Brown on December 2, following his raid on the federal arsenal at Harpers Ferry on October 16. Major Jackson was placed in command of the artillery, consisting of two howitzers manned by twenty-one cadets.\nCivil War.\nIn April 1861, after Virginia seceded from the Union and as the American Civil War broke out, Jackson was ordered by the Governor of Virginia to report with the VMI cadet corps to Richmond and await further orders. Upon arrival, Jackson was appointed a Major of Engineers in the Provisional Army of Virginia, which was a short lived force commanded by Robert E. Lee, prior to Virginia fully augmenting into forces of the Confederacy. After Jackson protested such a low rank, the Virginia Governor appointed him a Colonel of Virginia Infantry which in May 1861 was augmented to a Colonel in the Confederate Army. Jackson then became a drill master for some of the many new recruits in the Confederate Army.\nOn April 27, 1861, Virginia Governor John Letcher ordered Colonel Jackson to take command at Harpers Ferry, where he would assemble and command the unit which later gained fame as the \"Stonewall Brigade\", consisting of the 2nd, 4th, 5th, 27th, and 33rd Virginia Infantry regiments. These units were from the Shenandoah Valley region of Virginia, where Jackson located his headquarters throughout the first two years of the war, as well as counties in western Virginia. Jackson became known for his relentless drilling of his troops; he believed discipline was vital to success on the battlefield. Following raids on the B&amp;O Railroad on May 24, he was promoted to brigadier general on June 17, 1861. Jackson continued to wear a blue Union Army uniform up to this point, having only access to his old VMI major's jacket, and would not be issued with a gray Confederate uniform until 1862.\nFirst Battle of Bull Run.\nJackson rose to prominence and earned his most famous nickname at the First Battle of Bull Run (First Manassas) on July 21, 1861. As the Confederate lines began to crumble under heavy Union assault, Jackson's brigade provided crucial reinforcements on Henry House Hill, demonstrating the discipline he instilled in his men. While under heavy fire for several continuous hours, Jackson received a wound, breaking the middle finger of his left hand about midway between the hand and knuckle, the ball passing on the side next to the index finger. The troops of South Carolina, commanded by Gen.\u00a0Barnard E. Bee\u00a0had been overwhelmed, and he rode up to Jackson in despair, exclaiming, \"They are beating us back!\" \"Then,\" said Jackson, \"we will give them the bayonet!\" As he rode back to his command, Bee exhorted his own troops to re-form by shouting, \"There is Jackson standing like a stone wall. Let us determine to die here, and we will conquer. Rally behind the Virginians!\" There is some controversy over Bee's statement and intent, which could not be clarified because he was killed almost immediately after speaking and none of his subordinate officers wrote reports of the battle. Major Burnett Rhett, chief of staff to General Joseph E. Johnston, claimed that Bee was angry at Jackson's failure to come immediately to the relief of Bee's and Francis S. Bartow's brigades while they were under heavy pressure. Those who subscribe to this opinion believe that Bee's statement was meant to be pejorative: \"Look at Jackson standing there like a stone wall!\"\nRegardless of the controversy and the delay in relieving Bee, Jackson's brigade, which would thenceforth be known as the Stonewall Brigade, stopped the Union assault and suffered more casualties than any other Southern brigade that day; Jackson has since then been generally known as Stonewall Jackson. During the battle, Jackson displayed a gesture common to him and held his left arm skyward with the palm facing forward \u2013 interpreted by his soldiers variously as an eccentricity or an entreaty to God for success in combat. His hand was struck by a bullet or a piece of shrapnel and he suffered a small loss of bone in his middle finger. He refused medical advice to have the finger amputated. After the battle, Jackson was promoted to major general (October 7, 1861) and given command of the Valley District, with headquarters in Winchester.\nValley Campaign.\nIn the spring of 1862, Union Maj. Gen. George B. McClellan's Army of the Potomac approached Richmond from the southeast in the Peninsula Campaign. Maj. Gen. Irvin McDowell's large corps was poised to hit Richmond from the north, and Maj. Gen. Nathaniel P. Banks's army threatened the Shenandoah Valley. Jackson was ordered by Richmond to operate in the Valley to defeat Banks's threat and prevent McDowell's troops from reinforcing McClellan.\nJackson possessed the attributes to succeed against his poorly coordinated and sometimes timid opponents: a combination of great audacity, excellent knowledge and shrewd use of the terrain, and an uncommon ability to inspire his troops to great feats of marching and fighting.\nThe campaign started with a tactical defeat at Kernstown on March 23, 1862, when faulty intelligence led him to believe he was attacking a small detachment. But it became a strategic victory for the Confederacy, because his aggressiveness suggested that he possessed a much larger force, convincing President Abraham Lincoln to keep Banks' troops in the Valley and McDowell's 30,000-man corps near Fredericksburg, subtracting about 50,000 soldiers from McClellan's invasion force. As it transpired, it was Jackson's only defeat in the Valley.\nBy adding Maj. Gen. Richard S. Ewell's large division and Maj. Gen. Edward \"Allegheny\" Johnson's small division, Jackson increased his army to 17,000 men. He was still significantly outnumbered, but attacked portions of his divided enemy individually at McDowell, defeating both Brig. Gens. Robert H. Milroy and Robert C. Schenck. He defeated Banks at Front Royal and Winchester, ejecting him from the Valley. Lincoln decided that the defeat of Jackson was an immediate priority (though Jackson's orders were solely to keep Union forces occupied and away from Richmond). He ordered Irvin McDowell to send 20,000 men to Front Royal and Maj. Gen. John C. Fr\u00e9mont to move to Harrisonburg. If both forces could converge at Strasburg, Jackson's only escape route up the Valley would be cut.\nAfter a series of maneuvers, Jackson defeated Fr\u00e9mont's command at Cross Keys and Brig. Gen. James Shields at Port Republic on June 8\u20139. Union forces were withdrawn from the Valley.\nIt was a classic military campaign of surprise and maneuver. Jackson pressed his army to travel in 48 days of marching and won five significant victories with a force of about 17,000 against a combined force of 60,000. Stonewall Jackson's reputation for moving his troops so rapidly earned them the oxymoronic nickname \"foot cavalry\". He became the most celebrated soldier in the Confederacy (until he was eventually eclipsed by Lee) and lifted the morale of the Southern public.\nPeninsula.\nMcClellan's Peninsula Campaign toward Richmond stalled at the Battle of Seven Pines on May 31 and June 1. After the Valley Campaign ended in mid-June, Jackson and his troops were called to join Robert E. Lee's Army of Northern Virginia in defense of the capital. By using a railroad tunnel under the Blue Ridge Mountains and then transporting troops to Hanover County on the Virginia Central Railroad, Jackson and his forces made a surprise appearance in front of McClellan at Mechanicsville. Reports had last placed Jackson's forces in the Shenandoah Valley; their presence near Richmond added greatly to the Union commander's overestimation of the strength and numbers of the forces before him. This proved a crucial factor in McClellan's decision to re-establish his base at a point many miles downstream from Richmond on the James River at Harrison's Landing, essentially a retreat that ended the Peninsula Campaign and prolonged the war almost three more years.\nJackson's troops served well under Lee in the series of battles known as the Seven Days Battles, but Jackson's own performance in those battles is generally considered to be poor. He arrived late at Mechanicsville and inexplicably ordered his men to bivouac for the night within clear earshot of the battle. He was late at Savage's Station. At White Oak Swamp he failed to employ fording places to cross White Oak Swamp Creek, attempting for hours to rebuild a bridge, which limited his involvement to an ineffectual artillery duel and a missed opportunity to intervene decisively at the Battle of Glendale, which was raging nearby. At Malvern Hill Jackson participated in the futile, piecemeal frontal assaults against entrenched Union infantry and massed artillery, and suffered heavy casualties (but this was a problem for all of Lee's army in that ill-considered battle). The reasons for Jackson's sluggish and poorly coordinated actions during the Seven Days are disputed, although a severe lack of sleep after the grueling march and railroad trip from the Shenandoah Valley was probably a significant factor. Both Jackson and his troops were completely exhausted. An explanation for this and other lapses by Jackson was tersely offered by his colleague and brother in-law General Daniel Harvey Hill: \"Jackson's genius never shone when he was under the command of another.\"\nSecond Bull Run to Fredericksburg.\nThe military reputations of Lee's corps commanders are often characterized as Stonewall Jackson representing the audacious, offensive component of Lee's army, whereas his counterpart, James Longstreet, more typically advocated and executed defensive strategies and tactics. Jackson has been described as the army's hammer, Longstreet its anvil. In the Northern Virginia Campaign of August 1862 this stereotype did not hold true. Longstreet commanded the Right Wing (later to become known as the First Corps) and Jackson commanded the Left Wing. Jackson started the campaign under Lee's orders with a sweeping flanking maneuver that placed his corps into the rear of Union Maj. Gen. John Pope's Army of Virginia. The Hotchkiss journal shows that Jackson, most likely, originally conceived the movement. In the journal entries for March 4 and 6, 1863, General Stuart tells Hotchkiss that \"Jackson was entitled to all the credit\" for the movement and that Lee thought the proposed movement \"very hazardous\" and \"reluctantly consented\" to the movement. At Manassas Junction, Jackson was able to capture all of the supplies of the Union Army depot. Then he had his troops destroy all of it, for it was the main depot for the Union Army. Jackson then retreated and then took up a defensive position and effectively invited Pope to assault him. On August 28\u201329, the start of the Second Battle of Bull Run (Second Manassas), Pope launched repeated assaults against Jackson as Longstreet and the remainder of the army marched north to reach the battlefield.\nOn August 30, Pope came to believe that Jackson was starting to retreat, and Longstreet took advantage of this by launching a massive assault on the Union army's left with over 25,000 men. Although the Union troops put up a furious defense, Pope's army was forced to retreat in a manner similar to the embarrassing Union defeat at First Bull Run, fought on roughly the same battleground.\nWhen Lee decided to invade the North in the Maryland Campaign, Jackson took Harpers Ferry, then hastened to join the rest of the army at Sharpsburg, Maryland, where they fought McClellan in the Battle of Antietam (Sharpsburg). Antietam was primarily a defensive battle against superior odds, although McClellan failed to exploit his advantage. Jackson's men bore the brunt of the initial attacks on the northern end of the battlefield and, at the end of the day, successfully resisted a breakthrough on the southern end when Jackson's subordinate, Maj. Gen. A. P. Hill, arrived at the last minute from Harpers Ferry. The Confederate forces held their position, but the battle was extremely bloody for both sides, and Lee withdrew the Army of Northern Virginia back across the Potomac River, ending the invasion. On October 10, Jackson was promoted to lieutenant general, being ranked just behind Lee and Longstreet and his command was redesignated the Second Corps.\nBefore the armies camped for winter, Jackson's Second Corps held off a strong Union assault against the right flank of the Confederate line at the Battle of Fredericksburg, in what became a Confederate victory. Just before the battle, Jackson was delighted to receive a letter about the birth of his daughter, Julia Laura Jackson, on November 23. Also before the battle, Maj. Gen. J. E. B. Stuart, Lee's dashing and well-dressed cavalry commander, presented to Jackson a fine general's frock coat that he had ordered from one of the best tailors in Richmond. Jackson's previous coat was threadbare and colorless from exposure to the elements, its buttons removed by admiring ladies. Jackson asked his staff to thank Stuart, saying that although the coat was too handsome for him, he would cherish it as a souvenir. His staff insisted that he wear it to dinner, which caused scores of soldiers to rush to see him in uncharacteristic garb. Jackson was so embarrassed with the attention that he did not wear the new uniform for months.\nChancellorsville.\nAt the Battle of Chancellorsville, the Army of Northern Virginia faced a serious threat by the Army of the Potomac, led by its new commanding general, Major General Joseph Hooker. Lee decided to employ a risky tactic to take the initiative and offensive away from Hooker's new southern thrust \u2013 he decided to divide his forces. Jackson and his entire corps went on an aggressive flanking maneuver to the right of the Union lines. While riding with his infantry in a wide berth well south and west of the Federal line of battle, Jackson employed Maj. Gen. Fitzhugh Lee's cavalry to provide for better reconnaissance regarding the exact location of the Union right and rear. The results were far better than even Jackson could have hoped. Fitzhugh Lee found the entire right side of the Federal lines in the middle of open field, guarded merely by two guns that faced westward, as well as the supplies and rear encampments. The men were eating and playing games in carefree fashion, completely unaware that an entire Confederate corps was less than a mile away. What happened next is given in Fitzhugh Lee's own words:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;So impressed was I with my discovery, that I rode rapidly back to the point on the Plank road where I had left my cavalry, and back down the road Jackson was moving, until I met \"Stonewall\" himself. \"General\", said I, \"if you will ride with me, halting your column here, out of sight, I will show you the enemy's right, and you will perceive the great advantage of attacking down the Old turnpike instead of the Plank road, the enemy's lines being taken in reverse. Bring only one courier, as you will be in view from the top of the hill.\" Jackson assented, and I rapidly conducted him to the point of observation. There had been no change in the picture.\nI only knew Jackson slightly. I watched him closely as he gazed upon Howard's troops. It was then about 2\u00a0pm. His eyes burned with a brilliant glow, lighting up a sad face. His expression was one of intense interest, his face was colored slightly with the paint of approaching battle, and radiant at the success of his flank movement. To the remarks made to him while the unconscious line of blue was pointed out, he did not reply once during the five minutes he was on the hill, and yet his lips were moving. From what I have read and heard of Jackson since that day, I know now what he was doing then. Oh! \"beware of rashness\", General Hooker. Stonewall Jackson is praying in full view and in rear of your right flank! While talking to the Great God of Battles, how could he hear what a poor cavalryman was saying. \"Tell General Rodes\", said he, suddenly whirling his horse towards the courier, \"to move across the Old plank road; halt when he gets to the Old turnpike, and I will join him there.\" One more look upon the Federal lines, and then he rode rapidly down the hill, his arms flapping to the motion of his horse, over whose head it seemed, good rider as he was, he would certainly go. I expected to be told I had made a valuable personal reconnaissance\u2014saving the lives of many soldiers, and that Jackson was indebted to me to that amount at least. Perhaps I might have been a little chagrined at Jackson's silence, and hence commented inwardly and adversely upon his horsemanship. Alas! I had looked upon him for the last time.\u2014\u200a\nJackson immediately returned to his corps and arranged his divisions into a line of battle to charge directly into the oblivious Federal right. The Confederates marched silently until they were merely several hundred feet from the Union position, then released a cry and full charge. Many of the Federal soldiers were captured without a shot fired, the rest were driven into a full rout. Jackson pursued back toward the center of the Federal line until dusk.\nAs Jackson and his staff were returning to camp on May 2, sentries of the 18th North Carolina Infantry Regiment mistook the group for a Union cavalry force. The sentries shouted \"Halt, who goes there?\", but fired before evaluating the reply; frantic shouts by Jackson's staff identifying the party were replied to by Major John D. Barry with the retort, \"It's a damned Yankee trick! Fire!\" A second volley was fired in response. Jackson was hit by three bullets: two in the left arm and one in the right hand. Several of Jackson's men and many horses were killed in the attack. Incoming artillery rounds and darkness led to confusion, and Jackson was dropped from his stretcher while being evacuated. Surgeon Hunter McGuire amputated Jackson's left arm, and Jackson was moved to Fairfield plantation at Guinea Station. Thomas Chandler, the owner, offered the use of his home for Jackson's treatment, but Jackson suggested using Chandler's plantation office building instead.\nDeath.\nConfederate General Robert E. Lee wrote Jackson after learning of Jackson's injuries, stating: \"Could I have directed events, I would have chosen for the good of the country to be disabled in your stead.\" Jackson died of complications from pneumonia on May 10, 1863, eight days after he was shot.\nDr. McGuire wrote an account of Jackson's final hours and last words:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;A few moments before he died he cried out in his delirium, 'Order A.P. Hill to prepare for action! Pass the infantry to the front rapidly! Tell Major Hawks\u2014' then stopped, leaving the sentence unfinished. Presently a smile of ineffable sweetness spread itself over his pale face, and he said quietly, and with an expression, as if of relief, 'Let us cross over the river, and rest under the shade of the trees.'\nJackson's fatal bullet was withdrawn, examined, and found to be 67 caliber (0.67 inches, 17\u00a0mm), a type in service with the Confederate forces; Union troops in the area were using 58 caliber balls. This was one of the first instances of forensic ballistics identification derived from a firearm projectile.\nHis body was moved to the Governor's Mansion in Richmond for the public to mourn, and he was then moved to be buried in Oak Grove Cemetery in Lexington, Virginia. The arm that was amputated on May 2 was buried separately by Jackson's chaplain (Beverly Tucker Lacy), at the J. Horace Lacy house, \"Ellwood\", (now preserved at the Fredericksburg National Battlefield) in the Wilderness of Orange County, near the field hospital.\nJackson's body was buried in \"ordinary dress,\" but wearing a military coat. His coffin was draped with a Confederate flag and had a glass plate so that his face could be seen during public mourning. His funeral proceeded with great pomp: all pallbearers were generals (including James Longstreet), four white horses pulled the hearse, and a crowd two miles long followed the procession. In the course of public mourning, 20,000 people visited the body.\nUpon hearing of Jackson's death, Robert E. Lee mourned the loss of both a friend and a trusted commander. As Jackson lay dying, Lee sent a message through Chaplain Lacy, saying: \"Give General Jackson my affectionate regards, and say to him: he has lost his left arm but I my right.\" The night Lee learned of Jackson's death, he told his cook: \"William, I have lost my right arm\", and, \"I'm bleeding at the heart.\"\n\"Harper's Weekly\" reported Jackson's death on May 23, 1863, as follows:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;DEATH OF STONEWALL JACKSON.\nGeneral \"Stonewall\" Jackson was badly wounded in the arm at the battles of Chancellorsville, and had his arm amputated. Jackson initially appeared to be healing, but he died from pneumonia on May 10, 1863.\nPersonal life.\nJackson's sometimes unusual command style and personality traits, combined with his frequent success in battle, contribute to his legacy as one of the greatest generals of the Civil War. He was martial and stern in attitude and profoundly religious, a deacon in the Presbyterian Church. One of his many nicknames was \"Old Blue Lights\", a term applied to a military man whose evangelical zeal burned with the intensity of the blue light used for night-time display.\nPhysical ailments.\nJackson held a lifelong belief that one of his arms was longer than the other, and thus usually held the \"longer\" arm up to equalize his circulation. He was described as a \"champion sleeper\", and occasionally even fell asleep with food in his mouth. Jackson suffered a number of ailments, for which he sought relief via contemporary practices of his day including hydrotherapy, popular in America at that time, visiting establishments at Oswego, New York (1850) and Round Hill, Massachusetts (1860) although with little evidence of success. Jackson also suffered a significant hearing loss in both of his ears as a result of his prior service in the U.S. Army as an artillery officer.\nA recurring story concerns Jackson's love of lemons, which he allegedly gnawed whole to alleviate symptoms of dyspepsia (indigestion). General Richard Taylor, son of President Zachary Taylor, wrote a passage in his war memoirs about Jackson eating lemons: \"Where Jackson got his lemons 'no fellow could find out,' but he was rarely without one.\" However, recent research by his biographer, James I. Robertson, Jr., has found that none of Jackson's contemporaries, including members of his staff, his friends, or his wife, recorded any unusual obsessions with lemons. Jackson thought of a lemon as a \"rare treat ... enjoyed greatly whenever it could be obtained from the enemy's camp\". Jackson was fond of all fruits, particularly peaches, \"but he enjoyed with relish lemons, oranges, watermelons, apples, grapes, berries, or whatever was available\".\nReligion.\nJackson's religion has often been discussed. His biographer, Robert Lewis Dabney, suggested that \"It was the fear of God which made him so fearless of all else.\" Jackson himself had said, \"My religious belief teaches me to feel as safe in battle as in bed.\"\nStephen W. Sears states that \"Jackson was fanatical in his Presbyterian faith, and it energized his military thought and character. Theology was the only subject he genuinely enjoyed discussing. His dispatches invariably credited an ever-kind Providence.\" According to Sears, \"this fanatical religiosity had drawbacks. It warped Jackson's judgment of men, leading to poor appointments; it was said he preferred good Presbyterians to good soldiers.\" James I. Robertson, Jr. suggests that Jackson was \"a Christian soldier in every sense of the word\". According to Robertson, Jackson \"thought of the war as a religious crusade\", and \"viewed himself as an Old Testament warrior\u2014like David or Joshua\u2014who went into battle to slay the Philistines\".\nJackson encouraged the Confederate States Army revival that occurred in 1863, although it was probably more of a grass-roots movement than a top-down revival. Jackson strictly observed the Sunday Sabbath. James I. Robertson, Jr. notes that \"no place existed in his Sunday schedule for labor, newspapers, or secular conversation\".\nCommand style.\nIn command, Jackson was extremely secretive about his plans and extremely meticulous about military discipline. This secretive nature did not stand him in good stead with his subordinates, who were often not aware of his overall operational intentions until the last minute, and who complained of being left out of key decisions.\nRobert E. Lee could trust Jackson with deliberately undetailed orders that conveyed Lee's overall objectives, what modern doctrine calls the \"end state\". This was because Jackson had a talent for understanding Lee's sometimes unstated goals, and Lee trusted Jackson with the ability to take whatever actions were necessary to implement his end state requirements. Few of Lee's subsequent corps commanders had this ability. At Gettysburg, this resulted in lost opportunities. With a defeated and disorganized Union Army trying to regroup on high ground near town and vulnerable, Lee sent one of his new corps commanders, Richard S. Ewell, discretionary orders that the heights (Cemetery Hill and Culp's Hill) be taken \"if practicable\". Without Jackson's intuitive grasp of Lee's orders or the instinct to take advantage of sudden tactical opportunities, Ewell chose not to attempt the assault, and this failure is considered by historians to be the greatest missed opportunity of the battle.\nHorsemanship.\nJackson had a poor reputation as a horseman. One of his soldiers, Georgia volunteer William Andrews, wrote that Jackson was \"a very ordinary looking man of medium size, his uniform badly soiled as though it had seen hard service. He wore a cap pulled down nearly to his nose and was riding a rawboned horse that did not look much like a charger, unless it would be on hay or clover. He certainly made a poor figure on a horseback, with his stirrup leather six inches too short, putting his knees nearly level with his horse's back, and his heels turned out with his toes sticking behind his horse's foreshoulder. A sorry description of our most famous general, but a correct one.\" His horse was named \"Little Sorrel\" (also known as \"Old Sorrel\"), a small chestnut gelding which was a captured Union horse from a Connecticut farm. He rode Little Sorrel throughout the war, and was riding him when he was shot at Chancellorsville. Little Sorrel died at age 36 and is buried near a statue of Jackson on the parade grounds of VMI. (His mounted hide is on display in the VMI Museum.)\nMourning his death.\nAfter the war, Jackson's wife and young daughter Julia moved from Lexington to North Carolina. Mary Anna Jackson wrote two books about her husband's life, including some of his letters. She never remarried, and was known as the \"Widow of the Confederacy\", living until 1915. His daughter Julia married, and bore children, but she died of typhoid fever at the age of 26 years.\nLegacy.\nMany theorists through the years have postulated that if Jackson had lived, Lee might have prevailed at Gettysburg. Certainly Jackson's discipline and tactical sense were sorely missed.\nAs a boy, General George Patton (of World War II fame) prayed next to two portraits of Robert E. Lee and Stonewall Jackson, whom he assumed were God and Jesus. He once told Dwight D. Eisenhower \"I will be your Jackson.\" General Douglas MacArthur called Robert L. Eichelberger his Stonewall Jackson. Chesty Puller idolized Jackson, and carried George Henderson's biography of Jackson with him on campaigns. Alexander Vandegrift also idolized Jackson.\nHis last words, \"Let us cross over the river, and rest under the shade of the trees\" were the inspiration for the title of Ernest Hemingway's 1950 novel \"Across the River and into the Trees\".\nDescendants.\nJackson's grandson and great-grandson, both namesakes, Thomas Jonathan Jackson Christian (1888\u20131952) and Thomas Jonathan Jackson Christian Jr. (1915\u20131944), both graduated from West Point. The elder Christian was a career US Army officer who served during both World Wars and rose to the rank of brigadier general. Thomas Jonathan Jackson Christian's parents were William Edmund Christian and Julia Laura Christian. Julia was the daughter of Stonewall Jackson and his bride Mary Anna Morrison.\nThe younger Christian was a colonel in command of the 361st Fighter Group flying P-51 Mustangs in the European Theater of Operations in World War II when he was killed in action in August 1944; his personal aircraft, \"Lou IV\", was one of the most photographed P-51s in the war.\nCommemorations.\nAs an important element of the ideology of the \"Lost Cause\", Jackson has been commemorated in numerous ways, including with statues, currency, and postage. A poem penned during the war soon became a popular song, \"Stonewall Jackson's Way\". The Stonewall Brigade Band is still active today.\nWest Virginia's Stonewall Jackson State Park is named in his honor. Nearby, at Stonewall Jackson's historical childhood home, his uncle's grist mill is the centerpiece of a historical site at the Jackson's Mill Center for Lifelong Learning and State 4-H Camp. The facility, located near Weston, serves as a special campus for West Virginia University and the WVU Extension Service.\nDuring a training exercise in Virginia by U.S. Marines in 1921, the Marine commander, General Smedley Butler, was told by a local farmer that Stonewall Jackson's arm was buried nearby under a granite marker, to which Butler replied, \"Bosh! I will take a squad of Marines and dig up that spot to prove you wrong!\" Butler found the arm in a box under the marker. He later replaced the wooden box with a metal one, and reburied the arm. He left a plaque on the granite monument marking the burial place of Jackson's arm; the plaque is no longer on the marker but can be viewed at the Chancellorsville Battlefield Visitor Center.\nBeginning in 1904 the Commonwealth of Virginia celebrated Jackson's birthday as a state holiday; the observance was eliminated, with Election Day as a replacement holiday, effective July 2020.\nJackson is featured on the 1925 Stone Mountain Memorial half-dollar.\nA Stonewall Jackson Monument was unveiled on October 11, 1919, in Richmond, Virginia. It was removed on July 1, 2020, during the 2020\u20132021 United States racial unrest.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The World Bank defines tertiary education as including universities, colleges, and vocational schools. \"Higher education\" is taken to include undergraduate and postgraduate education, while vocational education beyond secondary education is known as \"further education\" in the United Kingdom, or included under the category of \"continuing education\" in the United States.\nTertiary education generally culminates in the receipt of certificates, diplomas, or academic degrees. Higher education represents levels 5, 6, 7, and 8 of the 2011 version of the International Standard Classification of Education structure. Tertiary education at a nondegree level is sometimes referred to as further education or continuing education as distinct from higher education.\nUNESCO stated that tertiary education focuses on learning endeavors in specialized fields. It includes academic and higher vocational education. The World Bank's 2019 World Development Report on the future of work argues that given the future of work and the increasing role of technology in value chains, tertiary education is becoming even more relevant for workers to compete in the labor market.\nDefinition.\nHigher education, also called post-secondary education, third-level or tertiary education, is an optional final stage of formal learning that occurs after completion of secondary education. This consists of universities, colleges and polytechnics that offer formal degrees beyond high school or secondary school education.\nThe International Standard Classification of Education in 1997 initially classified all tertiary education together in the 1997 version of its schema. They were referred to as level 5 and doctoral studies at level 6. In 2011, this was refined and expanded in the 2011 version of the structure. Higher education at undergraduate level, masters and doctoral level became levels 6, 7, and 8. Nondegree level tertiary education, sometimes referred to as further education or continuing education was reordered as level 4, with level 5 for some higher courses.\nIn the days when few pupils progressed beyond primary education or basic education, the term \"higher education\" was often used to refer to secondary education, which can create some confusion. This is the origin of the term \"high school\" for various schools for children between the ages of 14 and 18 (United States) or 11 and 18 (United Kingdom and Australia).\nHistory.\nThe oldest known institutions of higher education are credited to Dynastic Egypt, with Pr-Anx (houses of life) built as libraries and scriptoriums, containing works on law, architecture, mathematics, and medicine, and involved in the training of \"swnw\" and \"swnwt\" (male and female doctors); extant Egyptian papyri from the 3rd millennia BC are in several collections.\nIn the Greek world, Plato's Academy (c.\u2009387\u201386\u00a0BCE), Aristotle's Lyceum (c.\u2009334\u201386\u00a0BCE) and other philosophical-mathematical schools became models for other establishments, particularly in Alexandria of Egypt, under the Ptolemies.\nIn South Asia, the city of Taxila, later the great Buddhist monastery of Nalanda (c.\u2009427\u20131197\u00a0CE), attracted students and professors even from distant regions.\nIn China, the Han dynasty established chairs to teach the Five Confucean Classics, in the Grand School, Taixue (\u00a0CE), to train cadres for the imperial administration. All these higher-learning institutions became models for other schools within their sphere of cultural influence.\nIn 425 CE, the Byzantine emperor Theodosius II innovated as he established the Pandidakterion, with a faculty of 31 professors, to train public servants. In the 7th and 8th centuries, \"cathedral schools\" were created in Western Europe. Meanwhile, the first Madrasahs were founded in the Muslim empire \u2013 initially mere primary schools in the premises of major mosques, which gradually evolved toward secondary, later higher education. However high the intellectual level of these schools could be, it would be anachronistic to call them \"universities\". Their organization and purposes were markedly different from the corporations of students and teachers, independent from both the Church and the State, which established themselves from the 12th century in Western Europe as \"Universitas Studiorum\".\nAccording to UNESCO and \"Guinness World Records\", the University of al-Qarawiyyin in Fez, Morocco is the oldest existing continually operating higher educational institution in the world. and is occasionally referred to as the oldest university by scholars. Undoubtedly, there are older institutions of higher education, for example, the University of Ez-Zitouna in Montfleury, Tunis, was first established in 737. The University of Bologna, Italy, founded in 1088, is the world's oldest university in continuous operation, and the first university in the sense of a higher-learning and degree-awarding institute, as the word \"universitas\" was coined at its foundation. \n20th century.\nSince World War II, developed and many developing countries have increased the participation of the age group who mostly studies higher education from the elite rate, of up to 15 per cent, to the mass rate of 16 to 50 per cent. In many developed countries, participation in higher education has continued to increase towards universal or, what Trow later called, open access, where over half of the relevant age group participate in higher education. Higher education is important to national economies, both as an industry, in its own right, and as a source of trained and educated personnel for the rest of the economy. College educated workers have commanded a measurable wage premium and are much less likely to become unemployed than less educated workers.\n21st century.\nIn recent years, universities have been criticized for permitting or actively encouraging grade inflation. Widening participation can increase the supply of graduates in individual fields of study over the demand for their skills, aggravating graduate unemployment, underemployment, overqualification and educational inflation. Some commentators have suggested that the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on education is rapidly making certain aspects of the traditional higher education system obsolete. The Israeli-funded Institute for the Study of Global Antisemitism and Policy and some Israeli media have claimed that involvement and funding by Qatar in higher education in the US has resulted in what they regard as growing anti-Semitism on campuses, in particular in connection with Gaza war protests.\nEnrollment.\nGlobally, the gross enrollment ratio in tertiary education increased from 19% in 2000 to 38% in 2017, with the female enrollment ratio exceeding the male ratio by 4 percentage points.\nThe tertiary gross enrollment ratio ranges from 9% in low-income countries to 77% in high-income countries, where, after rapid growth in the 2000s, reached a plateau in the 2010s.\nBetween now and 2030, the biggest increase in tertiary enrollment ratios is expected in middle-income countries, where it will reach 52%. Sustainable Development Goal 4 (SDG 4) commits countries to providing lifelong learning opportunities for all, including tertiary education.\nThis commitment is monitored through the global indicator for target 4.3 in the sustainable development goal 4 (SDG 4), which measures the participation rate of youth and adults in formal and non-formal education and training in the previous 12 months, whether for work or non-work purposes.\nThe right of access to higher education is mentioned in a number of international human rights instruments. The UN International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights of 1966 declares, in Article 13, that \"higher education shall be made equally accessible to all, on the basis of capacity, by every appropriate means, and in particular by the progressive introduction of free education\". In Europe, Article 2 of the First Protocol to the European Convention on Human Rights, adopted in 1950, obliges all signatory parties to guarantee the right to education.\nUniversity completion rates for students with disabilities are much lower compared to completion rates of students without disabilities.\nGrade and educational inflation.\nSome tertiary schools have been criticized as having permitted or actively encouraged grade inflation. In addition, certain scholars contend that the supply of graduates in some fields of study is exceeding the demand for their skills, aggravating graduate unemployment, underemployment and educational inflation.\nEffects.\nGraduates of tertiary education are likely to have different worldviews and moral values than non-graduates. Graduates are also more likely to embrace cultural and ethnic diversity and express more positive views towards minority groups. For international relationships, graduates are more likely to favor openness, supporting policies like free trade, open borders, and more liberal policies regarding international migration.\nTertiary education has been linked to increases in human capital and economic growth, as well as reductions in poverty. A 2025 study found evidence suggesting that those who attend college are less prone to indoctrination.\nProviders.\nIn the U.S., higher education is provided by universities, academies, colleges, seminaries, conservatories, and institutes of technology, and certain college-level institutions, including vocational schools, universities of applied sciences, trade schools, and other career-based colleges that award degrees. Tertiary education at a nondegree level is sometimes referred to as further education or continuing education as distinct from higher education.\nHigher education includes teaching, research, exacting applied work, as exists in medical schools and dental schools, and social services activities of universities.\nWithin the realm of teaching, it includes both the \"undergraduate\" level, and beyond that, \"graduate-level\" (or \"postgraduate\" level). The latter level of education is often referred to as graduate school, especially in North America. In addition to the skills that are specific to any particular degree, potential employers in any profession are looking for evidence of critical thinking and analytical reasoning skills, teamworking skills, information literacy, ethical judgment, decision-making skills, fluency in speaking and writing, problem solving skills, and a wide knowledge of liberal arts and sciences.\nCredential evaluation.\nForeign tertiary degrees can be validated after credential evaluation, for example according to the Lisbon Recognition Convention.\nStatistics.\nThe total expenditure on tertiary education (ISCED levels 5 to 8) as a percentage of GDP for individual countries is shown in the following table\nThe percentage of adults who have attained individual tertiary education levels by country is shown in the following table.\nA 2014 report by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development states that by 2014, 84 percent of young people were completing upper secondary education over their lifetimes, in high-income countries. Tertiary-educated individuals were earning twice as much as median workers. In contrast to historical trends in education, young women were more likely to complete upper secondary education than young men. Additionally, access to education was expanding and growth in the number of people receiving university education was rising sharply. By 2014, close to 40 percent of people aged 25\u201334 (and around 25 percent of those aged 55\u201364), were being educated at university.\nBy region.\nAustralia.\nWithin Australia, \"tertiary education\" refers to continuing studies after a student completes secondary school. Tertiary education options include universities, technical and further education (TAFE) and private universities.\nEurope.\nAlthough tertiary education in the EU includes university, it can differ from country to country.\nFrance.\nAfter going to nursery school (French: ), elementary school (French: ), middle school (French: ), and high school (French: ), a student may go to university, but may also stop at that point.\nItaly.\nEducation in Italy is compulsory from 6 to 16 years of age, and is divided into five stages: kindergarten (\"scuola dell'infanzia\"), primary school (\"scuola primaria\" or \"scuola elementare\"), lower secondary school (\"scuola secondaria di primo grado\" or \"scuola media inferiore\"), upper secondary school (\"scuola secondaria di secondo grado\" or \"scuola media superiore\") and university (\"universit\u00e0\"). Education is free in Italy and free education is available to children of all nationalities who are residents in Italy. Italy has both a private and public education system.\nItaly has a large and international network of public or state-affiliated universities and schools offering degrees in higher education. State-run universities of Italy constitute the main percentage of tertiary education in Italy and are managed under the supervision of Italian's Ministry of Education.\nItalian universities are among the oldest universities in the world; the University of Bologna (founded in 1088) notably, is the oldest one ever; also, University of Naples Federico II is the world's oldest state-funded university in continuous operation. Most universities in Italy are state-supported. 33 Italian universities were ranked among the world's top 500 in 2019, the third-largest number in Europe after the United Kingdom and Germany.\nThere are also a number of Superior Graduate Schools (\"Grandes \u00e9coles\") or \"Scuola Superiore Universitaria\", which offer officially recognized titles, including the \"Diploma di Perfezionamento\" equivalent to a Doctorate, \"Dottorato di Ricerca\" i.e. Research Doctorate or \"Doctor Philosophiae\" i.e. PhD. Some of them also organize master's degree courses. There are three Superior Graduate Schools with \"university status\", three institutes with the status of Doctoral Colleges, which function at graduate and post-graduate level. Nine further schools are direct offshoots of the universities (i.e. do not have their own 'university status'). The first one is the Scuola Normale Superiore di Pisa (founded in 1810 by Napoleon as a branch of \u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure), taking the model of organization from the famous \u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure. These institutions are commonly referred to as \"Schools of Excellence\" (i.e. \"Scuole di Eccellenza\").\nItaly hosts a broad variety of universities, colleges and academies. Founded in 1088, the University of Bologna is likely the oldest in the world. In 2009, the University of Bologna is, according to The Times, the only Italian college in the top 200 World Universities. Milan's Bocconi University has been ranked among the top 20 best business schools in the world by The Wall Street Journal international rankings, especially thanks to its M.B.A. program, which in 2007 placed it no. 17 in the world in terms of graduate recruitment preference by major multinational companies. Bocconi was also ranked by Forbes as the best worldwide in the specific category Value for Money. In May 2008, Bocconi overtook several traditionally top global business schools in the Financial Times Executive education ranking, reaching no. 5 in Europe and no. 15 in the world.\nOther top universities and polytechnics are the Universit\u00e0 Cattolica del Sacro Cuore in Milan, the LUISS in Rome, the Polytechnic University of Turin, the Politecnico di Milano (which in 2011 was ranked as the 48th best technical university in the world by QS World University Rankings), the University of Rome La Sapienza (which in 2005 was Europe's 33rd best university, and ranks among Europe's 50 and the world's 150 best colleges and in 2013, the Center for World University Rankings ranked the Sapienza University of Rome 62nd in the world and the top in Italy in its \"World University Rankings\".) and the University of Milan (whose research and teaching activities have developed over the years and have received important international recognition). This university is the only Italian member of the League of European Research Universities (LERU), a prestigious group of twenty research-intensive European Universities. It has also been awarded ranking positions such as 1st in Italy and 7th in Europe (The Leiden Ranking \u2013 Universiteit Leiden).\nKazakhstan.\nTertiary education in Kazakhstan is governed by the Law on Education of the Republic of Kazakhstan, model rules for higher-education institutions, and individual university charters. It encompasses universities and other higher-education institutions, with governance structures defined by law and institutional statutes.\nThe Ministry of Science and Higher Education supervises accreditation, licensing, and quality assurance for tertiary institutions. Rectors and academic councils manage day-to-day operations within universities and colleges, while individual charters provide additional rules for governance, curricula, and institutional procedures. Students have the right to access state-guaranteed higher education, subject to admission requirements and state regulations.\nUnited Kingdom.\nUnder devolution in the United Kingdom, education is administered separately in England, Wales, Northern Ireland, and Scotland. In England, the term \"tertiary education\" aligns with the global term \"higher education\" (i.e. post-18 study). In 2018 the Welsh Government adopted the term \"tertiary education\" to refer to post-16 education and training in Wales. Since the 1970s, however, specialized further education colleges in England and Wales have called themselves \"tertiary colleges\" although being part of the secondary education process. These institutions cater for both school leavers and adults, thus combining the main functions of an FE college and a sixth form college. Generally, district councils with such colleges have adopted a tertiary system or structure where a single local institution provides all the 16\u201319 and adult education, and where schools do not universally offer sixth forms (i.e. schools only serve ages 11\u201316). However the Further and Higher Education Act 1992 has effectively prevented the creation of new tertiary colleges.\nNorth America.\nUnited States.\nThe higher education system in the United States is decentralized and regulated independently by each state with accreditors playing a key role in ensuring institutions meet minimum standards. It is large and diverse with institutions that are privately governed and institutions that are owned and operated by state and local governments. Some private institutions are affiliated with religious organizations whereas others are secular with enrollment ranging from a few dozen to tens of thousands of students. The United States Department of Education presents a broad-spectrum view of tertiary education and detailed information on the nation's educational structure, accreditation procedures, and connections to state as well as federal agencies and entities.\nThe Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education provides one framework for classifying U.S. colleges and universities in several different ways. US tertiary education also includes various non-profit organizations promoting professional development of individuals in the field of higher education and helping expand awareness of related issues like international student services and complete campus internationalization.\nAfrica.\nNigeria.\nIn Nigeria, \"tertiary education\" refers to post-secondary education received at universities (government or privately funded), monotechnics, polytechnics and colleges of education. After completing a secondary education, students may enroll in a tertiary institution or acquire a vocational education. Students are required to sit for the Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board Entrance Examination (JAMB) as well as the Secondary School Certificate Examination (SSCE) or General Certificate Examination (GCE) and meet varying cut-off marks to gain admission into a tertiary institution.\nAsia.\nJapan.\nAccording to MEXT (Ministry of Education) and UNESCO, following types of education are classified as tertiary education: University education (undergraduate, postgraduate and professional degrees), two-year colleges (\"Tanki Daigaku\"), colleges of technology and specialised colleges.\nHong Kong.\nIn Hong Kong \"tertiary education\" or \"higher education\" refers to any education higher than secondary education. Tertiary education includes universities, post secondary colleges, statutory universities, and publicly funded institutions.\nSingapore.\nIn Singapore, \"tertiary education\" or \"Post-secondary Education\" refers to any education higher than secondary education. Tertiary education includes, Junior Colleges, Centralised institutes, Polytechnics, the Institute of Technical Education and Universities.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "31489", "revid": "28903366", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31489", "title": "Trimix (breathing gas)", "text": "Breathing gas consisting of oxygen, helium and nitrogen\nTrimix is a breathing gas consisting of oxygen, helium, and nitrogen. It is used in deep commercial diving, during the deep phase of dives carried out using technical diving techniques, and in advanced recreational diving.\nThe helium is included as a substitute for some of the nitrogen, to reduce the narcotic effect of the breathing gas at depth and to reduce the work of breathing. With a mixture of three gases it is possible to create mixes suitable for different depths or purposes by adjusting the proportions of each gas. Oxygen content can be optimised for the depth to limit the risk of toxicity, and the inert component balanced between nitrogen (which is cheap but narcotic) and helium (which is not narcotic and reduces work of breathing, but is more expensive and can increase heat loss).\nThe mixture of helium and oxygen with a 0% nitrogen content is generally known as heliox. This is frequently used as a breathing gas in deep commercial diving operations, where it is often recycled to save the expensive helium component. Analysis of two-component gases is much simpler than three-component gases.\nApplications.\nTrimix is used as an ambient pressure breathing gas for underwater diving. It has been used in both scuba and surface-supplied applications, for professional and recreational diving, and for surface oriented and saturation diving. The most common use is in recreational technical diving.\nIn open-circuit scuba, two classes of trimix are commonly used: \"normoxic\" trimix\u2014with a minimum PO2 at the surface of 0.18 and \"hypoxic\" trimix\u2014with a PO2 less than 0.18 at the surface. A normoxic mix such as \"19/30\" is used in the depth range; a hypoxic mix such as \"10/50\" is used for deeper diving, as a bottom gas only, and cannot safely be breathed at shallow depths where the PO2 is less than 0.18 bar.\nIn fully closed-circuit rebreathers that use trimix diluents, the mix in the breathing loop can be \"hyperoxic\" (meaning more oxygen than in air, as in enriched air nitrox) in shallow water, because the rebreather automatically adds oxygen to maintain a specific partial pressure of oxygen. Hyperoxic trimix is also sometimes used on open circuit scuba, to reduce decompression obligations.\nFunction of the helium.\nThe main reason for adding helium to the breathing mix is to reduce the proportions of nitrogen and oxygen below those of air, to allow the gas mix to be breathed safely on deep dives. A lower proportion of nitrogen is required to reduce nitrogen narcosis and other physiological effects of the gas at depth. Helium has very little narcotic effect. A lower proportion of oxygen reduces the risk of oxygen toxicity on deep dives.\nThe lower density of helium reduces breathing resistance at depth. Work of breathing can limit the use of breathing gas mixtures in underwater breathing apparatus, as with increasing depth a point may be reached where work of breathing exceeds the available effort from the diver. Beyond this point accumulation of carbon dioxide will eventually result in severe and debilitating hypercapnia, which, if not corrected quickly, will cause the diver to attempt to breathe faster, exacerbating the work of breathing, which will lead to loss of consciousness and a high risk of drowning.\nBecause of its low molecular weight, helium enters and leaves tissues by diffusion more rapidly than nitrogen as the pressure is increased or reduced (this is called on-gassing and off-gassing). Because of its lower solubility, helium does not load tissues as heavily as nitrogen, but at the same time the tissues can not support as high an amount of helium when super-saturated. In effect, helium is a faster gas to saturate and desaturate, which is a distinct advantage in saturation diving, but less so in bounce diving, where the increased rate of off-gassing is largely counterbalanced by the equivalently increased rate of on-gassing.\nSome divers suffer from compression arthralgia during deep descent, and trimix has been shown to help avoid or delay the symptoms of compression arthralgia.\nDisadvantages of the helium.\nHelium conducts heat six times faster than air, so helium-breathing divers often carry a separate supply of a different gas to inflate drysuits. This is to avoid the risk of hypothermia caused by using helium as inflator gas. Argon, carried in a small, separate tank connected only to the inflator of the drysuit, is preferred to air, since air conducts heat 50% faster than argon. Dry suits (if used together with a buoyancy compensator) still require a minimum of inflation to avoid \"suit squeeze\", i.e. injury to skin caused by pinching by tight dry suit folds.\nHelium diffuses into tissues (called ingassing) more rapidly than nitrogen as the ambient pressure is increased. A consequence of the higher loading in some tissues is that some decompression algorithms require deeper decompression stops than a similar pressure exposure dive using air, and helium is more likely to come out of solution and cause decompression sickness following a fast ascent.\nIn addition to physiological disadvantages, the use of trimix also has economic and logistic disadvantages. The price of helium increased by over 51% between the years 2000 and 2011. This price increase affects open-circuit divers more than closed-circuit divers due to the larger volume of helium consumed on a typical trimix dive. Additionally, as trimix fills require more expensive helium analysis equipment than air and nitrox fills, there are fewer trimix filling stations. The relative scarcity of trimix filling stations may necessitate going far out of one's way in order to procure the necessary mix for a deep dive that requires the gas.\nAdvantages of controlling the oxygen fraction.\nLowering the oxygen content of a breathing gas mixture increases the maximum operating depth and duration of the dive before which oxygen toxicity becomes a limiting factor. Most trimix divers limit their working oxygen partial pressure [PO2] to 1.4 bar and may reduce the PO2 further to 1.3 bar or 1.2 bar depending on the depth, the duration and the kind of breathing system used. A maximum oxygen partial pressure of 1.4 bar for the active sectors of the dive, and 1.6 bar for decompression stops is recommended by several recreational and technical diving certification agencies for open circuit, and 1.2 bar or 1.3 bar as maximum for the active sectors of a dive on closed-circuit rebreather. Increasing the oxygen fraction in a trimix to be used as a decompression gas can accelerate decompression with a lowered risk of isobaric counter diffusion complications.\nAdvantages of keeping some nitrogen in the mix.\nRetaining nitrogen in trimix can contribute to the prevention of High Pressure Nervous Syndrome, a problem that can occur when breathing heliox at depths beyond about . Nitrogen is also much less expensive than helium.\nNaming conventions.\nThe term trimix implies that the gas has three functional components, which are helium, nitrogen and oxygen. Since the nitrogen and all or part of the oxygen is usually provided from air, the other components of ordinary atmospheric air are generally ignored. Conventionally, the composition of a mix is specified by its oxygen percentage, helium percentage and optionally the balance percentage, nitrogen, in that order. For example, a mix named \"trimix 10/70\" or trimix 10/70/20, consisting of 10% oxygen, 70% helium, 20% nitrogen is suitable for a dive. Hyperoxic trimix is sometimes referred to as Helitrox, TriOx, or HOTx (High Oxygen Trimix) with the \"x\" in HOTx representing the mixture's fraction of helium as a percentage.\nThe basic term Trimix is sufficient, modified as appropriate with the terms hypoxic, normoxic and hyperoxic, and the usual forms for indicating constituent gas fraction, to describe any possible ratio of gases, but the National Association of Underwater Instructors (NAUI) uses the term \"helitrox\" for hyperoxic 26/17 Trimix, i.e. 26% oxygen, 17% helium, 57% nitrogen. Helitrox requires decompression stops similar to Nitrox-I (EAN32) and has a maximum operating depth of , where it has an equivalent narcotic depth of . This allows diving throughout the usual recreational range, while decreasing decompression obligation and narcotic effects compared to air. GUE and UTD also promote hyperoxic trimix for this depth range, but prefer the term \"TriOx\".\nThe use of trimix as a breathing gas while diving is called trimix diving, and is a sub-category of mixed gas diving, also sometimes referred to simply as gas diving.\nBlending.\nGas blending of trimix generally involves mixing helium and oxygen with air to the desired proportions and pressure. Two methods are in common use:\nPartial pressure blending is done by decanting oxygen and helium into the diving cylinder and then topping up the mix with air from a diving air compressor. To ensure an accurate mix, after each helium and oxygen transfer, the mix is allowed to cool, its pressure is measured and further gas is decanted until the correct pressure is achieved. This process often takes hours and is sometimes spread over days at busy blending stations. Corrections can be made for temperature effect, but this requires accurate monitoring of the temperature of the mixture inside the cylinder, which is generally not available.\nA second method called 'continuous blending' is done by mixing oxygen and helium into the intake air of a compressor. The oxygen and helium are fed into mixing tubes in the intake air stream using flow meters or analysis of the oxygen content after oxygen addition and before and after the helium addition, and the oxygen and helium flows adjusted accordingly. On the high pressure side of the compressor a regulator or bleed orifice is used to reduce pressure of a sample flow and the trimix is analyzed (preferably for both helium and oxygen) so that the fine adjustment to the intake gas flows can be made. The benefit of such a system is that the helium delivery tank pressure need not be as high as that used in the partial pressure method of blending and residual gas can be 'topped up' to best mix after the dive. This is important mainly because of the high cost of helium. Drawbacks may be that the high heat of compression of helium results in the compressor overheating, especially in hot weather. Temperature of the trimix entering the analyser should be kept constant for best reliability of the analysis, and the analyser should be calibrated at ambient temperature before use. The mixing tube is a very simple device, and DIY versions of the continuous blend units can be made for a relatively low cost compared to the cost of analysers and compressor.\nChoice of mixture composition.\nThe ratio of gases in a particular mix is chosen to give a safe maximum operating depth and comfortable equivalent narcotic depth for the planned dive. Safe limits for mix of gases in trimix are generally accepted to be a maximum partial pressure of oxygen (PO2\u2014see Dalton's law) of 1.0 to 1.6 bar and maximum equivalent narcotic depth of . At , \"12/52\" has a PO2 of 1.3 bar and an equivalent narcotic depth of .\nMix composition choice is also affected by limitations on breathing gas density to prevent excessive work of breathing.\n\"Standard\" mixes.\nAlthough theoretically trimix can be blended with almost any combination of helium and oxygen, a number of \"standard\" mixes have evolved (such as 21/35, 18/45 and 15/55\u2014see \"Naming conventions\"). Most of these mixes originated from starting by decanting a given pressure of helium into an empty cylinder, and then topping up the mix with 32% nitrox. The \"standard\" mixes evolved because of three coinciding factors \u2014 the desire to keep the equivalent narcotic depth (END) of the mix at approximately , the requirement to keep the partial pressure of oxygen at 1.4 ATA or below at the deepest point of the dive, and the fact that many dive shops stored standard 32% nitrox in banks, which simplifies mixing. The use of standard mixes makes it relatively easy to top up diving cylinders after a dive using residual mix \u2014 only helium and banked nitrox are needed to top up the residual gas from the last fill. This can be also be applied by using a compressor with a membrane separation system or continuous blending set for a Nitrox32 output.\nThe method of mixing a known nitrox mix with helium allows analysis of the fractions of each gas using only an oxygen analyser, since the ratio of the oxygen fraction in the final mix to the oxygen fraction in the initial nitrox gives the fraction of nitrox in the final mix, hence the fractions of the three components are easily calculated. It is demonstrably true that the END of a nitrox-helium mixture at its maximum operating depth (MOD) is equal to the MOD of the nitrox alone.\nHeliair.\nHeliair is a breathing gas consisting of mixture of oxygen, nitrogen and helium and is often used during the deep phase of dives carried out using technical diving techniques. This term, first used by Sheck Exley, is mostly used by Technical Diving International (TDI).\nIt is easily blended from helium and air and so has a fixed 21:79 ratio of oxygen to nitrogen with the balance consisting of a variable amount of helium. It is sometimes referred to as \"poor man's trimix\", because it is much easier to blend than trimix blends with variable oxygen content, since all that is required is to insert the requisite partial pressure of helium, and then top up with air from a conventional compressor. The more complicated (and dangerous) step of adding pure oxygen at pressure required to blend trimix is absent when blending heliair.\nHeliair blends are similar to the standard Trimix blends made with helium and Nitrox 32, but with a deeper END at MOD.\nHeliair will always have less than 21% oxygen, and will be hypoxic (less than 17% oxygen) for mixes with more than 20% helium.\nTraining and certification.\nTechnical diver training and certification agencies may differentiate between levels of trimix diving qualifications, The usual distinction is between normoxic trimix and hypoxic trimix, sometimes also called full trimix. The basic distinction is that for hypoxic trimix diving the dive cannot be started on the bottom mix, and procedures for use of a \"travel mix\" for the first part of the descent, and gas switching during the descent to avoid oxygen toxicity are added to the required skills. Longer decompression using a larger variety of mixtures may also complicate procedures. In closed circuit rebreather diving, use of a hypoxic diluent prevents the diver from conducting a diluent flush at shallow depths while breathing from the loop, so that it remains possible at the maximum depth of the dive, where it may be more critical.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Within the framework of theoretical chemistry, there is a systematization of chemical laws, principles and rules, their refinement and detailing, the construction of a hierarchy. The central place in theoretical chemistry is occupied by the doctrine of the interconnection of the structure and properties of molecular systems. It uses mathematical and physical methods to explain the structures and dynamics of chemical systems and to correlate, understand, and predict their thermodynamic and kinetic properties. In the most general sense, it is explanation of chemical phenomena by methods of theoretical physics. In contrast to theoretical physics, in connection with the high complexity of chemical systems, theoretical chemistry, in addition to approximate mathematical methods, often uses semi-empirical and empirical methods.\nIn recent years, it has consisted primarily of quantum chemistry, i.e., the application of quantum mechanics to problems in chemistry. Other major components include molecular dynamics, statistical thermodynamics and theories of electrolyte solutions, reaction networks, polymerization, catalysis, molecular magnetism and spectroscopy.\nModern theoretical chemistry may be roughly divided into the study of chemical structure and the study of chemical dynamics. The former includes studies of: electronic structure, potential energy surfaces, and force fields; vibrational-rotational motion; equilibrium properties of condensed-phase systems and macro-molecules.

It was first published in Danish in 1998 by Centrum, and in English by Cambridge University Press in 2001.\nLomborg was inspired by an interview with economist Julian Lincoln Simon to undertake an assessment of publicly available data, and published his findings as a series of articles in \"Politiken\". These formed the basis of the book, in which Lomborg argues against a range of what he considers overly pessimistic claims about environmental issues and their impact on human prosperity. Lomborg argues that environmentalists' concerns over pollution, environmental degradation, decline in natural resources, and climate change are overstated, and outlines his opposition to policy responses like the Kyoto Protocol, deeming them insufficient and causing more harm than good based on cost\u2013benefit analysis. He argues in favour of focus instead being channelled to poverty reduction and combating diseases.\nThe book generated great controversy and negative reviews upon its release. Lomborg's assertions, methodology and representation of sources were criticised by scientists and groups both in Denmark and internationally. Positive reception in some popular media outlets contrasted sharply with this, and this combined with the ensuing debate aided the book's profile.\nThe author was formally investigated by the Danish Committees on Scientific Dishonesty (DCSD) for scientific dishonesty, which confirmed the accusation and lack of expertise in relevant fields used in the book. The Danish Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation criticised procedural aspects drawn by the DCSD, though decided not to reinvestigate. \"The Skeptical Environmentalist\" established Lomborg's profile as an opponent of the scientific consensus on climate change. In 2007, Lomborg published a follow-up work titled \"\".\nBackground.\nThe book was written by Bj\u00f8rn Lomborg, a Danish statistician who worked at Aarhus University. The ideas and writing for the book began in the 1990s. He was inspired by an interview with Julian Lincoln Simon which was published in the magazine \"Wired\", in which Simon claimed that calculations he had conducted with publicly available data led him to conclude that standard doomsday conceptions of the state of the world were incorrect. He assumed Simon's views were the product of his American conservative thinking, but in 1997, Lomborg undertook a similar assessment with some of his students and came to similar conclusions as Simon. \nIn 1998, Lomborg published four articles in the Danish newspaper, \"Politiken,\" outlining his research and study. These attracted media coverage and controversy in Denmark. These findings were published as a book in Danish on 22 September 1998 as \"Verdens Sande Tilstand\" (\"The True State of the World\") by Centrum. and as \"The Skeptical Environmentalist\" in English, by Cambridge University Press in 2001. Sections on global warming, notes and references were expanded in the English edition.\nContents.\n\"The Skeptical Environmentalist\"'s subtitle refers to the \"State of the World\" report, published annually since 1984 by the Worldwatch Institute. Lomborg designated the report \"one of the best-researched and academically most ambitious environmental policy publications,\" but criticized it for using short-term trends to predict disastrous consequences, in cases where long-term trends would not support the same conclusions.\nIn establishing its arguments, \"The Skeptical Environmentalist\" examined a wide range of issues in the general area of environmental studies, including environmental economics and science, and came to a set of conclusions and recommendations. Lomborg's work directly challenged what it framed as \"the Litany of our ever deteriorating environment\" by interpreting data from around 3,000 mostly secondary sources. The author suggests that environmentalists have diverted potentially beneficial resources to less deserving environmental issues in ways that were economically damaging. He portrays his book as an unbiased and scientific refutation of the claims of environmental groups. Much of the book's methodology and integrity have been subject to criticism, which argue that Lomborg distorted the fields of research he covers.\n\"The Skeptical Environmentalist\" is arranged around four major themes:\nLomborg's main argument is that the vast majority of environmental problems\u2014such as pollution, water shortages, deforestation, and species loss, as well as population growth, hunger, and AIDS\u2014are area-specific and highly correlated with poverty. He concludes that challenges to human prosperity are essentially logistical matters, and can be solved largely through economic and social development. \nReception.\nThe book generally received negative reviews from the scientific community, focusing on the author's methodology, data issues, theories and concepts. The most common critiques were the selective use of data, followed by referencing, and lack of focus on the environmental movement. Most environmental scientists argued that the book was deeply flawed, and that the state of the environment was not clearly represented. In some cases, reviews were harsh in both content and tone.\nThe Danish Ecological Council, an advisory committee on environmental issues, published a \"counter-publication\" which criticised Lomborg's methods and approach in his book. The publication was released in 1999 as \"Fremtidens Pris\" (\"The Price of the Future\"), written by 18 contributors of various disciplines. \n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nI would fail one of my undergraduate students if they were to write such trash.\n Jeffrey Harvey on \"The Skeptical Environmentalist\"\nThe Union of Concerned Scientists published a critique of the book, highlighting reviews by Peter Gleick, Jerry D. Mahlman, Thomas Lovejoy, Norman Myers, Jeffrey Harvey, E. O. Wilson and Stuart Pimm. They concluded that the book fits squarely in a tradition of contrarian environmental works, which may gain temporary prominence but ultimately fail to stand up to scientific scrutiny. Harvey compared the book unfavourably to University undergraduate quality, and added \"ecology is the most complex of sciences and Lomborg has never done a shred of work in the field\". In a letter, Wilson said that the greatest regret he had about the book was \"the time wasted by scientists correcting the misinformation created.\"\nIn January 2002, a heading from \"Scientific American\" read, \"Misleading Math about the Earth\" and contained set of essays written by scientists on the book. The article concluded that \"The Skeptical Environmentalist\" misrepresented both scientific evidence and opinion. The journal also refused Lomborg's request of publishing a defense print of 32 pages, rather a page in the later May issue in 2002. The magazine later published his complete rebuttal on its website, along with the counter rebuttals of John Rennie and John P. Holdren.\n\"Nature\" also published a harsh review of Lomborg's book, in which Stuart Pimm of the Center for Environmental Research and Conservation at Columbia University and Jeff Harvey of the Netherlands Institute of Ecology wrote: \"Like bad term papers, Lomborg's text relies heavily on secondary sources. Out of around 2,000 references, about 5% come from news sources and 30% from web downloads \u2014 readily accessible, therefore, but frequently not peer reviewed.\" They continued that \"the text employs the strategy of those who, for example, argue that gay men aren't dying of AIDS, that Jews weren't singled out by the Nazis for extermination, and so on.\"\nPeter Gleick was also highly critical, stating \"there is nothing original or unique in Lomborg's book. Many of his criticisms have appeared in... previous works\u2014and even in the work of environmental scientists themselves. What is new, perhaps, is the scope and variety of the errors he makes.\" David Pimentel wrote a critical review in \"Population and Environment\", particularly taking issue with Lomborg's argument on soil erosion, pesticides, deforestation and water resources. He concluded that \"as an agricultural scientist and ecologist, I wish I could share Lomborg's optimistic views, but my investigations and that of countless scientists leads me to a more conservative outlook.\" Roger A. Pielke, meanwhile, defended Lomborg and the book, describing the debate as an example of politicising science.\nThe 12 December 2001 issue of \"Grist\" devoted an issue to \"The Skeptical Environmentalist\", with a series of essays from various scientists challenging individual sections. A separate article examining the book's overall approach by Kathryn Schulz took issue with the framing of Lomborg's conclusions, asking \"[why] does he weigh the environment only against hospitals and childcare, rather than against, say, industry subsidies and defense spending?\".\nLegal scholar David Shoenbrod was one of the defenders of Lomborg. In March 2003, the \"New York Law School Law Review\" published an examination of the critical reviews of \"Skeptical Environmentalist\" from the \"Scientific American\", \"Nature\" and \"Science\" magazines by Shoenbrod and then-Senior Law Student Christi Wilson of New York Law School. The authors defend Lomborg, say that the book is \"largely free from factual errors\", and characterise the scientific community's response to the book as a \"disingenuous attack\", using legal arguments that a court should accept Lomborg as a credible expert witness in the field of statistics, given that his testimony would be appropriately restricted to his area of expertise.\nMedia coverage.\nThe book was widely cited in conservative media and groups who oppose environmental regulations. Influential UK newsweekly \"The Economist\" supported Lomborg's views, publishing an advance essay by Lomborg in which he detailed his \"litany\", and following up with a highly favorable review and supportive coverage. It stated that \"This is one of the most valuable books on public policy\u2014not merely environmental policy\u2014to have been written for the intelligent general reader in the past ten years...\"The Skeptical Environmentalist\" is a triumph.\"\nIn a profile of Lomborg preceding the book's publication \"The New York Times\" stated that \"The primary target of the book, a substantial work of analysis with almost 3,000 footnotes, are statements made by environmental organizations like the Worldwatch Institute, the World Wildlife Fund and Greenpeace.\" In August 2001, \"The Guardian\" published three exclusive essays by Lomborg and hosted an online debate with him, describing him as \"Europe's most controversial environmental thinker\". The \"Wall Street Journal\" deemed Lomborg's work \"a superbly documented and readable book.\" In \"The Washington Post,\" Denis Dutton claimed that \"Bj\u00f8rn Lomborg's good news about the environment is bad news for Green ideologues. His richly informative, lucid book is now the place from which environmental policy decisions must be argued. In fact, \"The Skeptical Environmentalist\" is the most significant work on the environment since the appearance of its polar opposite, Rachel Carson's \"Silent Spring\", in 1962. It's a magnificent achievement.\" \"Rolling Stone\" wrote that \"Lomborg pulls off the remarkable feat of welding the techno-optimism of the Internet age with a lefty's concern for the fate of the planet.\"\nChris Lavers gave a mixed review in \"The Guardian\", saying Lomborg \"is clearly committed to rubbishing the views of hand-picked environmentalists, frequently the very silly ones such as Ehrlich, whom professionals have been ignoring for decades\" and criticising his framing of deforestation.\nIn a BBC column from 23 August 2001, veteran BBC environmental correspondent Alex Kirby wrote:\nI am neither a statistician nor a scientist, and I lack the skill to judge Lomborg's reworkings of the statistics of conventional wisdom. But I am worried that on virtually every topic he touches, he reaches conclusions radically different from almost everybody else. That seems to suggest that most scientists are wrong, short-sighted, na\u00efve, interested only in securing research funds, or deliberately dancing to the campaigners' tune. Most I know are honest, intelligent and competent. So it beggars belief to suppose that Professor Lomborg is the only one in step, every single time.\nKirby's first concern was not with the extensive research and statistical analysis, but the conclusions drawn from them, concluding: \"In the rational world that Bj\u00f8rn Lomborg thinks we all inhabit, we would manage problems sensibly, one by one. But the real world is messier, more unpredictable\u2014and more impatient.\"\nReception of media coverage.\nShortly after its release, the World Resources Institute and World Wide Fund for Nature published a nine-point critique of Lomborg's work and credentials specifically targeted at journalists, advising them to \"proceed with caution\" in their coverage of the book. One critical article, \"The Skeptical Environmentalist: A Case Study in the Manufacture of News\", attributes the book's media success to its initial, influential supporters, who linked its message to a European visit from United States president George W. Bush.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n News of the pending book first appeared in the UK in early June of 2001 when a \"Sunday Times\" article by Nayab Chohan featured an advanced report of claims made by Lomborg that London's air was cleaner than at any time since 1585. Headlined \"Cleanest London Air for 400 Years\", the publicity hook was both local and timely, as the tail end of the article linked the book's questioning of the Kyoto climate change protocol to U.S. president George W. Bush's visit the same week to Europe, and Bush's controversial opposition to the treaty. The\" Times \"followed up the report the next day with a news article further detailing the book's Kyoto protocol angle. With \"The Times\" reports, Lomborg and his claims had made the Anglo media agenda. As is typically the case, other media outlets followed the reporting of the elite newspaper. Articles pegging the claims of \"The Skeptical Environmentalist\" to Bush's European visit ran later that week in the U.K's \"The Express\" and \"Daily Telegraph\", and Canada's \"Toronto Star\".\nMarc Kreider, \"Skeptical Inquirer\"\nRichard C. Bell, writing for Worldwatch argued that many reviews in prominent publications were written by individuals with prior association with Lomborg, \"instead of seeking scientists with a critical perspective.\" In \"The Wall Street Journal\", a review was published by the Competitive Enterprise Institute's Ronald Bailey, someone \"who had earlier written a book called The True State of the World, from which much of Lomborg's claims were taken.\" Bell also criticized the \"Washington Post\", whose Sunday Book World assigned the book review to Denis Dutton, identified as \"a professor of philosophy who lectures on the dangers of pseudoscience at the science faculties of the University of Canterbury in New Zealand\", and the editor of the web site Arts and Letters Daily. Bell noted that \"The \"Post\" did not tell its readers that Dutton's web site features links to the Global Climate Coalition, an anti-Kyoto consortium of oil and coal businesses, and to the messages of Julian Simon\u2014the man whose denial that global warming was occurring apparently gave Lomborg the idea for his book in the first place.\"\nPieing incident.\nOn 5 September 2001, at a promotional event at a Borders book shop in Oxford, England, British environmentalist author Mark Lynas threw a cream pie in Lomborg's face. While doing so, he said \"I wanted to put a Baked Alaska in his smug face in solidarity with the native Indian and Eskimo people in Alaska\". In a post on Indymedia titled \"Why I pied Lomborg\", Lynas stated \"Lomborg specialises in presenting the reader with false choices\u2014such as the assertion that money not spent on preventing climate change could be spent on bringing clean water to the developing world, thereby saving more lives per dollar of expenditure. Of course, in the real world, these are not the kind of choices we are faced with.\" Lynas also commented on the difficulty of challenging Lomborg's book, arguing \"his work, as flawed as it is, has clearly been very time-consuming and meticulous. In a busy and under funded world, few people have the time or background knowledge to plow though 3,000 footnotes checking his sources. It is impressively interdisciplinary.\" \nLomborg said he was \"stunned\" by the incident, but \"at least the pie tasted good\". Lynas later apologised to Lomborg and said that he regretted pieing him. The two would later be on \"friendly\" terms.\nAccusations of scientific dishonesty.\nAfter the publication of \"The Skeptical Environmentalist\", Lomborg was accused of scientific dishonesty. Several environmental scientists brought a total of three complaints against Lomborg to the Danish Committees on Scientific Dishonesty (DCSD), a body under Denmark's Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation. Lomborg was asked whether he regarded the book as a \"debate\" publication, and thereby not under the purview of the DCSD, or as a scientific work; he chose the latter, clearing the way for the inquiry that followed. The charges stated that \"The Skeptical Environmentalist\" contained deliberately misleading data and flawed conclusions. Due to the similarity of the complaints, the DCSD decided to proceed on the three cases under one investigation.\nDanish Committees on Scientific Dishonesty investigation.\nA six-month review took place and on 6 January 2003, a 17-page DCSD ruling was released, in which the Committees decided that \"The Skeptical Environmentalist\" showed \"systematic one-sidedness\" and was scientifically dishonest, but Lomborg was innocent of wrongdoing due to a lack of expertise in the relevant fields. The investigation heavily relied on published reviews of the book.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nObjectively speaking, the publication of the work under consideration is deemed to fall within the concept of scientific dishonesty. ... In view of the subjective requirements made in terms of intent or gross negligence, however, Lomborg's publication cannot fall within the bounds of this characterization. Conversely, the publication is deemed clearly contrary to the standards of good scientific practice.\n Danish Committees on Scientific Dishonesty\nThe DCSD cited \"The Skeptical Environmentalist\" for fabrication of data, selective discarding of unwanted results (selective citation), deliberately misleading use of statistical methods, distorted interpretation of conclusions, plagiarism and deliberate misinterpretation of others' results.\nLomborg defended his work, challenging the committee for not identifying specific errors. He also argued the report could jeopardise his employment at the Danish Institute for Environmental Assessment and some of his critics attempted to do this, although government officials denied his posting would be impacted.\nThe DCSD decision about Lomborg led to a petition from some Danish social scientists, calling for the body to be abolished and arguing the body cannot hold the book to the same standards as medical and natural sciences. Another group of around 600 Danish scientists, many of them from medical and natural science fields, collected signatures in support of the DCSD. The ruling was also debated in parliament, and science minister Helge Sander asked the Danish Research Agency to establish a working group to scrutinise the DCSD's procedures.\nMinistry of Science, Technology and Innovation review and response.\nOn 13 February 2003, Lomborg filed a complaint against the DCSD's decision with the Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation (MSTI), which oversees the group. On 17 December, the Ministry released a report identifying a number of procedural errors had made, although did not refute any criticisms of the book. It criticised the DCSD for not identifying specific areas of error and for not providing an opportunity for Lomborg to respond before the report's publication.\nThe Ministry then remitted the case to the DCSD, and instructed the DCSD to decide whether to reinvestigate. On 12 March 2004, the Committee formally decided not to act further on the complaints, reasoning that renewed scrutiny would, in all likelihood, result in the same conclusion.\nLegacy.\nJim Giles wrote a 2003 retrospective on the book in \"Nature\", saying it was \"packed with facts and figures, yet it was the emotional response that it inspired that will be best remembered,\" and argued that it would have little long-lasting influence. Giles suggested the intense critical reaction from scientists and environmental groups was driven by fears that the book's talking points would be adopted by the Bush administration, but their criticisms conversely boosted sales and Lomborg's profile. Cambridge University Press said sales of the book quadrupled in the month following negative reviews in \"Scientific American\". Jeffrey Harvey, who had debated Lomborg several times by 2003, admitted that the tone of attacks on Lomborg could have been counterproductive. In 2005, an article by a group of non-climatologist scientists published in the \"Journal of Information Ethics\", claimed that most criticism against the book was unjustified, and that the scientific community had misused their authority to suppress the author. The claim that the accusations against Lomborg were unjustified was challenged in the next issue of the journal by K\u00e5re Fog who asserts that, \"despite the ministry's decision, most of the accusations against Lomborg were valid.\" He also rejected the Galileo hypothesis, \"that Lomborg is a brave young man confronting old-fashioned opposition.\" \nAnother article published in the \"Journal of Integrative Environmental Sciences\" in 2010, recounted the controversy surrounding the book and criticised the author and publisher, saying \"the question remains why a book that contains so many flaws by someone without any scientific credentials has received so much public attention.\" The article also pointed to contradiction of the principles of environmental economics in the book. They concluded that \"the book is anyway sure to go down in history as an unreliable source of information and argumentation, being one of the most severely criticized texts issued ever by a prestigious academic publisher\". \nDespite the controversy, \"The Skeptical Environmentalist\" established Lomborg as a public figure and prominent critic of the scientific consensus on climate change. He was named one of the \"Time\" 100 most influential people in 2004, and established the Copenhagen Consensus to institutionalize his views. He was also appointed director of the Environmental Assessment Institute in Denmark. By 2004, some polluting industries bodies had already quoted Lomborg or invited him to speak to further their agendas. \"The Skeptical Environmentalist\" was followed by \"\", which was published in 2007.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "31494", "revid": "48022469", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31494", "title": "Tricyclic antidepressant", "text": "Class of medications\nTricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) are a class of medications that are used primarily as antidepressants. TCAs were discovered in the early 1950s and were marketed later in the decade. They are named after their chemical structure, which contains three rings of atoms. Tetracyclic antidepressants (TeCAs), which contain four rings of atoms, are a closely related group of antidepressant compounds.\nAlthough TCAs are sometimes prescribed for depressive disorders, they have been largely replaced in clinical use in most parts of the world by newer antidepressants such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin\u2013norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (NRIs). Adverse effects have been found to be of a similar level between TCAs and SSRIs.\nMedical uses.\nThe TCAs are used primarily in the clinical treatment of mood disorders such as major depressive disorder (MDD), dysthymia, and treatment-resistant variants. They are also used in the treatment of a number of other medical disorders, including cyclic vomiting syndrome (CVS) and anxiety disorders such as generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), social phobia (SP) also known as social anxiety disorder (SAD), obsessive-compulsive disorder, premature ejaculation (clomipramine) and panic disorder (PD), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), body dysmorphic disorder (BDD), eating disorders like anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa, certain personality disorders such as borderline personality disorder (BPD) and Avoidant personality disorder (AvPD), neurological disorders such as attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), Parkinson's disease and Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), as well as chronic pain, neuralgia or neuropathic pain, Complex regional pain syndrome and fibromyalgia, headache, or migraine, smoking cessation, tourette syndrome, trichotillomania, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), interstitial cystitis (IC), nocturnal enuresis (NE), narcolepsy, insomnia, pathological crying and/or laughing, chronic hiccups, ciguatera poisoning, and as an adjunct in schizophrenia and certain psychotic disorders.\nNortriptyline and desipramine may be preferred medications over other TCAs among older adults due to their reduced anticholinergic effects, diminished cardiac toxicity, and more linear pharmacokinetics.\nClinical depression.\nFor many years the TCAs were the first choice for pharmacological treatment of major depression. Although they are still considered to be effective, they have been increasingly replaced by antidepressants with an improved safety and side-effect profile, such as the SSRIs and other newer antidepressants such as the novel reversible MAOI moclobemide. However, TCAs have been claimed to possibly be more effective in treating melancholic depression than other antidepressant drug classes. Newer antidepressants are thought to have fewer and less severe side effects and are also thought to be less likely to result in injury or death if used in a suicide attempt, as the doses required for clinical treatment and potentially lethal overdose (see therapeutic index) are far wider in comparison.\nNonetheless, the TCAs are commonly prescribed for treatment-resistant depression that has failed to respond to therapy with newer antidepressants, they also tend to have fewer emotional blunting and sexual side effects than SSRI antidepressants. They are not considered addictive and are somewhat preferable to the monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs). The side effects of the TCAs usually come to prominence before the therapeutic benefits against depression and/or anxiety do, and for this reason, they may potentially be somewhat dangerous, as volition can be increased, possibly giving the patient a greater desire to attempt or commit suicide.\nA 2024 systematic review and meta-analysis assessed the beneficial and harmful effects of TCAs in the treatment of major depressive disorder in adults. Previous systematic reviews and meta-analyses had not comprehensively assessed TCAs in the same fashion, with the largest including only two TCAs (amitriptyline and clomipramine) and only 36trials. A total of 103 short-term clinical trials with 10,590 participants employing 12 different TCAs (and TeCAs) were included. TCAs showed a small benefit on depression over that of placebo in terms of reduction in Hamilton Depression Rating Scale-17 (HDRS-17) scores (mean difference: \u20133.77 points; or with removal of an outlier study: \u20133.16 points). Due to the possibility of unblinding by side effects, it was unclear whether TCAs had a genuine antidepressant effect or whether the benefits were merely due to amplified placebo effects. TCAs had a higher rate of serious adverse effects than placebo, but this did not reach statistical significance (ORTooltip odds ratio = 2.78; 95% CI: 2.18\u20133.55; k = 35). The quality of evidence was low to very low and the results were at high risk of bias. Among the collaborators of the systematic review and meta-analysis included Irving Kirsch, Joanna Moncrieff, and Michael P. Hengartner.\nAttention-deficit hyperactivity disorder.\nThe TCAs were used in the past in the clinical treatment of ADHD, though they are not typically used anymore, having been replaced by more effective agents with fewer side effects such as atomoxetine (Strattera, Tomoxetin) and stimulants like methylphenidate (Ritalin, Focalin, Concerta), and amphetamine (Adderall, Attentin, Dexedrine, Vyvanse). ADHD is thought to be caused by an insufficiency of dopamine and norepinephrine activity in the prefrontal cortex of the brain. Most of the TCAs inhibit the reuptake of norepinephrine, though not dopamine, and as a result, they show some efficacy in remedying the disorder. Notably, the TCAs are more effective in treating the behavioral aspects of ADHD than the cognitive deficits, as they help limit hyperactivity and impulsivity, but have little to no benefits on attention.\nChronic pain.\nThe TCAs show efficacy in the clinical treatment of a number of different types of chronic pain, notably neuralgia or neuropathic pain and fibromyalgia. The precise mechanism of action in explanation of their analgesic efficacy is unclear, but it is thought that they indirectly modulate the opioid system in the brain downstream via serotonergic and noradrenergic neuromodulation, among other properties. They are also effective in migraine prophylaxis, though not in the instant relief of an acute migraine attack. They may also be effective to prevent chronic tension headaches. Tricyclic antidepressant are supposed to have effect on reducing mast cell degranulation, thus reducing pain and the symptoms associated with mast cell activation, such as IBS pain; people with IBS exhibit increased mucosal mast cells, elevated tryptase/histamine, and enhanced proximity of degranulating mast cells to enteric nerves, each correlating with subjective pain scores. The ability of tricyclic antidepressants that have mast-cell stabilizing effects (such as amitriptyline) to reduce subjective pain score are believed to help not simply by altering mood, but by reducing visceral afferent firing, possibly through attenuation of nerve-mast cell crosstalk.\nSide effects.\nMany side effects may be related to the antimuscarinic properties of the TCAs. Such side effects are relatively common and may include dry mouth, dry nose, blurry vision, lowered gastrointestinal motility or constipation, urinary retention, cognitive and/or memory impairment, and increased body temperature.\nOther side effects may include drowsiness, anxiety, emotional blunting (apathy/anhedonia), confusion, restlessness, dizziness, akathisia, hypersensitivity, changes in appetite and weight, sweating, muscle twitches, weakness, nausea and vomiting, hypotension, tachycardia, and rarely, irregular heart rhythms. Twitching, hallucinations, delirium and coma are also some of the toxic effects caused by overdose. Rhabdomyolysis or muscle breakdown has been rarely reported with this class of drugs as well.\nDelayed ejaculation may be experienced by some tricyclic antidepressants such as clomipramine.\nTolerance to these adverse effects of these drugs often develops if treatment is continued. Side effects may also be less troublesome if treatment is initiated with low doses and then gradually increased, although this may also delay the beneficial effects.\nTCAs can behave like class 1A antiarrhythmics, as such, they can theoretically terminate ventricular fibrillation, decrease cardiac contractility and increase collateral blood circulation to ischemic heart muscle. Naturally, in overdose, they can be cardiotoxic, prolonging heart rhythms and increasing myocardial irritability.\nNew research has also revealed compelling evidence of a link between long-term use of anticholinergic medications like TCAs and dementia. Although many studies have investigated this link, this was the first study to use a long-term approach (over seven years) to find that dementias associated with anticholinergics may not be reversible even years after drug use stops. Anticholinergic drugs block the action of acetylcholine, which transmits messages in the nervous system. In the brain, acetylcholine is involved in learning and memory.\nDiscontinuation.\nAntidepressants in general may produce withdrawal. However, since the term \"withdrawal\" has been linked to addiction to recreational drugs like opioids, the medical profession and pharmaceutical public relations prefer that a different term be used, hence \"discontinuation syndrome.\" Discontinuation symptoms can be managed by a gradual reduction in dosage over a period of weeks or months to minimise symptoms.\nIn tricyclics, discontinuation syndrome symptoms include anxiety, insomnia, cholinergic rebound, headache, nausea, malaise, or motor disturbance.\nOverdose.\nTCA overdose is a significant cause of fatal drug poisoning. The severe morbidity and mortality associated with these drugs is well documented due to their cardiovascular and neurological toxicity. Additionally, it is a serious problem in the pediatric population due to their inherent toxicity and the availability of these in the home when prescribed for bed-wetting and depression. In the event of a known or suspected overdose, medical assistance should be sought immediately.\nA number of treatments are effective in a TCA overdose.\nAn overdose on TCA is especially fatal as it is rapidly absorbed from the GI tract in the alkaline conditions of the small intestines. As a result, toxicity often becomes apparent in the first hour after an overdose. However, symptoms may take several hours to appear if a mixed overdose has caused delayed gastric emptying.\nMany of the initial signs are those associated to the anticholinergic effects of TCAs such as dry mouth, blurred vision, urinary retention, constipation, dizziness, and emesis (or vomiting). Due to the location of norepinephrine receptors all over the body, many physical signs are also associated with a TCA overdose:\nTreatment of TCA overdose depends on severity of symptoms:\nInitially, gastric decontamination of the patient is achieved by administering, either orally or via a nasogastric tube, activated charcoal pre-mixed with water, which adsorbs the drug in the gastrointestinal tract (most useful if given within 2 hours of drug ingestion). Other decontamination methods such as stomach pumps, gastric lavage, whole bowel irrigation, or (ipecac induced) emesis, are \"not\"\u00a0 recommended in TCA poisoning.\nIf there is metabolic acidosis, intravenous infusion of sodium bicarbonate is recommended by Toxbase.org, the UK and Ireland poisons advice database (TCAs are protein bound and become less bound in more acidic conditions, so by reversing the acidosis, protein binding increases and bioavailability thus decreases \u2013 the sodium load may also help to reverse the Na+ channel blocking effects of the TCA).\nInteractions.\nThe TCAs are highly metabolised by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) hepatic enzymes. Drugs that inhibit cytochrome P450 (for example cimetidine, methylphenidate, fluoxetine, antipsychotics, and calcium channel blockers) may produce decreases in the TCAs' metabolism, leading to increases in their blood concentrations and accompanying toxicity. Drugs that prolong the QT interval including antiarrhythmics such as quinidine, the antihistamines astemizole and terfenadine, and some antipsychotics may increase the chance of ventricular dysrhythmias. TCAs may enhance the response to alcohol and the effects of barbiturates and other CNS depressants. Side effects may also be enhanced by other drugs that have antimuscarinic properties.\nPharmacology.\nThe majority of the TCAs act primarily as SNRIs by blocking the serotonin transporter (SERT) and the norepinephrine transporter (NET), which results in an elevation of the synaptic concentrations of these neurotransmitters, and therefore an enhancement of neurotransmission. Notably, with the sole exception of amineptine, the TCAs have weak affinity for the dopamine transporter (DAT), and therefore have low efficacy as dopamine reuptake inhibitors (DRIs). Both serotonin and norepinephrine have been highly implicated in depression and anxiety, and it has been shown that facilitation of their activity has beneficial effects on these mental disorders.\nIn addition to their reuptake inhibition, many TCAs also have high affinity as antagonists at the 5-HT1, 5-HT2 (5-HT2A and 5-HT2C), 5-HT6, 5-HT7, \u03b11-adrenergic, and NMDA receptors, and as agonists at the sigma receptors (\u03c31 and \u03c32), some of which may contribute to their therapeutic efficacy, as well as their side effects. The TCAs also have varying but typically high affinity for antagonising the H1 and H2 histamine receptors, as well as the muscarinic acetylcholine receptors. As a result, they also act as potent antihistamines and anticholinergics. These properties are often beneficial in antidepressants, especially with comorbid anxiety, as it provides a sedative effect.\nMost, if not all, of the TCAs also potently inhibit sodium channels and -type calcium channels, and therefore act as sodium channel blockers and calcium channel blockers, respectively. The former property is responsible for the high mortality rate upon overdose seen with the TCAs via cardiotoxicity. It may also be involved in their efficacy as analgesics, however.\nIn summary, tricyclic antidepressants can act through NMDA antagonism, opioidergic effects, sodium, potassium and calcium channel blocking, through interfering with the reuptake of serotonin and acting as antagonists to SHAM (serotonin, histamine, alpha, muscarinic) receptors.\nBinding profiles.\nThe binding profiles of various TCAs and some metabolites in terms of their affinities (Ki, nM) for various receptors and transporters are as follows:\nWith the exception of the sigma receptors, the TCAs act as antagonists or inverse agonists of the receptors and as inhibitors of the transporters. Tianeptine is included in this list due to it technically being a TCA, but with a vastly different pharmacology.\nTherapeutic levels of TCAs are generally in the range of about 100 to 300\u00a0ng/mL, or 350 to 1,100\u00a0nM. Plasma protein binding is generally 90% or greater.\nChemistry.\nThere are two major groups of TCAs in terms of chemical structure, which most, but not all, TCAs fall into. The groupings are based on the tricyclic ring system. They are the dibenzazepines (imipramine, desipramine, clomipramine, trimipramine, lofepramine) and the dibenzocycloheptadienes (amitriptyline, nortriptyline, protriptyline, butriptyline). Minor TCA groups based on ring system include the dibenzoxepins (doxepin), the dibenzothiepines (dosulepin), and the dibenzoxazepines (amoxapine).\nIn addition to classification based on the ring system, TCAs can also be usefully grouped based on the number of substitutions of the side chain amine. These groups include the tertiary amines (imipramine, clomipramine, trimipramine, amitriptyline, butriptyline, doxepin, dosulepin) and the secondary amines (desipramine, nortriptyline, protriptyline). Lofepramine is technically a tertiary amine, but acts largely as a prodrug of desipramine, a secondary amine, and hence is more similar in profile to the secondary amines than to the tertiary amines. Amoxapine does not have the TCA side chain and hence is neither a tertiary nor secondary amine, although it is often grouped with the secondary amines due to sharing more in common with them. In 2021, a new method was developed at the Institute for Bioengineering of Catalonia for designing photochromic analogs of tricyclic drugs via (1) isosteric replacement of the two-atom bridge between the aromatic systems with an azo group and (2) opening of the central ring. The authors named the strategy \"crypto-azologization\".\nHistory.\nThe TCAs were developed amid the \"explosive birth\" of psychopharmacology in the early 1950s. The story begins with the synthesis of chlorpromazine in December 1950 by Rh\u00f4ne-Poulenc's chief chemist, Paul Charpentier, from synthetic antihistamines developed by Rh\u00f4ne-Poulenc in the 1940s. Its psychiatric effects were first noticed at a hospital in Paris in 1952. The first widely used psychiatric drug, by 1955 it was already generating significant revenue as an antipsychotic. Research chemists quickly began to explore other derivatives of chlorpromazine.\nThe first TCA reported for the treatment of depression was imipramine, a dibenzazepine analogue of chlorpromazine code-named G22355. It was not originally targeted for the treatment of depression. The drug's tendency to induce manic effects was \"later described as 'in some patients, quite disastrous'\". The paradoxical observation of a sedative inducing mania led to testing with depressed patients. The first trial of imipramine took place in 1955 and the first report of antidepressant effects was published by Swiss psychiatrist Roland Kuhn in 1957. Some testing of Geigy's imipramine, then known as Tofranil, took place at the M\u00fcnsterlingen Hospital near Konstanz. Geigy later became Ciba-Geigy and eventually Novartis.\nDibenzazepine derivatives are described in U.S. patent 3,074,931 issued 1963-01-22 by assignment to Smith Kline &amp; French Laboratories. The compounds described share a tricyclic backbone different from the backbone of the TCA amitriptyline.\nMerck introduced the second member of the TCA family, amitriptyline (Elavil), in 1961. This compound has a different three-ring structure than imipramine.\nSociety and culture.\nRecreational use.\nA very small number of cases involving non-medical use of antidepressants have been reported over the past 30 years. According to the US government classification of psychiatric medications, TCAs are \"non-abusable\" and generally have low misuse potential. Nonetheless, due to their atypical mechanism of action, amineptine and tianeptine (dopamine reuptake inhibition and \u03bc-opioid receptor agonism, respectively) are the two TCAs with the highest addiction and misuse potential. Several cases of the misuse of amitriptyline alone or together with methadone or in other drug dependent patients and of dosulepin with alcohol or in methadone patients have been reported.\nVeterinary use.\nTCAs are also used in veterinary medicine for anxiolytic, anticompulsive, and antiaggressive purposes. Most use is off-label, with the exception of clomipramine (Clomicalm chewable tablet), which is FDA-approved for separation anxiety in dogs when paired with behavior modification. Psychotrophic medication is generally \"not\" the first-line treatment for behavior problems. For example, although the American Association of Feline Practitioners (AAFP) and the International Society of Feline Medicine (ISFM) mention TCAs in their guide for the treatment of house-soiling in cats, they are to be attempted only for severe, recurrant cases, after all other methods have failed.\nList of TCAs.\nThose that preferentially inhibit the reuptake of serotonin (by at least 10-fold over norepinephrine) include:\nThose that preferentially inhibit the reuptake of norepinephrine (by at least 10-fold over serotonin) include:\nWhereas either fairly balanced reuptake inhibitors of serotonin and norepinephrine or unspecified inhibitors include:\nAnd the following are TCAs that act via main mechanisms other than serotonin or norepinephrine reuptake inhibition:\nLegend:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Plainlist/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He played his entire 19-year Major League Baseball (MLB) career, primarily as a left fielder, for the Boston Red Sox from 1939 to 1960; his career was interrupted by military service during World War II and the Korean War. Nicknamed \"Teddy Ballgame\", \"the Kid\", \"the Splendid Splinter\", and \"the Thumper\", Williams is widely regarded as one of the greatest hitters in baseball history in addition to being the last player to hit over .400 in an MLB season.\nWilliams was a nineteen-time All-Star, a two-time recipient of the AL Most Valuable Player Award, a six-time AL batting champion, and a two-time Triple Crown winner. He finished his playing career with a .344 batting average, 521 home runs, and a 1.116 on-base plus slugging percentage, the second highest of all time. His career batting average is the highest of any MLB player whose career was played primarily after World War II, and ranks 11th all-time.\nBorn and raised in San Diego, Williams played baseball throughout his youth. After joining the Red Sox in 1939, he immediately emerged as one of the sport's best hitters. In 1941, Williams posted a .406 batting average; he is the second-last baseball player to bat over .400 in a season. Williams's career .482 on-base percentage is the highest of all-time. Williams followed this up by winning his first Triple Crown in 1942. Williams was required to interrupt his baseball career in 1943 to serve three years in the United States Navy and Marine Corps during World War II. Upon returning to MLB in 1946, Williams won his first AL MVP Award and played in his only World Series. In 1947, he won his second Triple Crown. Williams was returned to active military duty for portions of the 1952 and 1953 seasons to serve as a Marine combat aviator in the Korean War. In 1957 and 1958 at the ages of 39 and 40, respectively, he was the AL batting champion for the fifth and sixth time.\nWilliams retired from playing in 1960. He was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1966, in his first year of eligibility. Williams managed the Washington Senators/Texas Rangers franchise from 1969 to 1972. An avid sport fisherman, he hosted a television program about fishing, and was inducted into the IGFA Fishing Hall of Fame. Williams' involvement in the Jimmy Fund helped raise millions in dollars for cancer care and research. In 1991, President George H. W. Bush presented Williams with the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest civilian award bestowed by the United States government. He was selected for the Major League Baseball All-Time Team in 1997 and the Major League Baseball All-Century Team in 1999.\nEarly life.\nTheodore Samuel Williams was born on August 30, 1918, in San Diego, California, and named \"Teddy Samuel\" after former president Theodore \"Teddy\" Roosevelt as well as his father, Samuel Stuart Williams. Williams himself claimed that his middle name was in honor of a maternal uncle (whose name was actually Daniel Venzor) who had been killed in World War I. He disliked the name \"Teddy\" and later amended his birth certificate to say \"Theodore\" instead.\nHis father was a soldier, sheriff, and photographer from Ardsley, New York, who had served in the United States Army and was a veteran of Philippine\u2013American War. His mother, May Venzor, a Mexican-American from El Paso, Texas, was an evangelist and lifelong soldier in the Salvation Army. Williams resented his mother's long hours working in the Salvation Army, and Williams and his brother cringed when she took them to the Army's street-corner revivals.\nWilliams' paternal ancestors were a mix of Welsh, English, and Irish. The maternal, Spanish-Mexican side of Williams' family was quite diverse, having Basque, Russian, and American Indian roots. Of his Mexican ancestry, he said, \"If I had my mother's name, there is no doubt I would have run into problems in those days, [considering] the prejudices people had in Southern California.\"\nWilliams lived in San Diego's North Park neighborhood (4121 Utah Street). He spent much of his time playing ball with his friends at a field that later became known as Ted Williams Field. At the age of eight, he was taught how to throw a baseball by his uncle, Saul Venzor. Saul was one of his mother's four brothers, as well as a former semi-professional baseball player who had pitched against Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig, and Joe Gordon in an exhibition game. As a child, Williams' heroes were Pepper Martin of the St. Louis Cardinals and Bill Terry of the New York Giants. Williams graduated from Herbert Hoover High School in San Diego, where he played baseball as a pitcher and was the star of the team. During this time, he also played American Legion Baseball, later being named the 1960 American Legion Baseball Graduate of the Year.\nThough he had offers from the St. Louis Cardinals and the New York Yankees while he was still in high school, his mother thought he was too young to leave home, so he signed up with the local Pacific Coast League (PCL) club, the San Diego Padres.\nProfessional career.\nMinor leagues.\nWilliams played back-up behind Vince DiMaggio and Ivey Shiver on the (then) Pacific Coast League's San Diego Padres. While in the Pacific Coast League in 1936, Williams met future teammates and friends Dom DiMaggio and Bobby Doerr, who were on the Pacific Coast League's San Francisco Seals. When Shiver announced he was quitting to become a high school football coach in Savannah, Georgia, the job, by default, was open for Williams. Williams posted a .271 batting average and 11 runs batted in (RBI) on 107 at bats in 42 games for the Padres in 1936. Unknown to Williams, he had caught the eye of the Boston Red Sox's general manager, Eddie Collins, while Collins was scouting Doerr and the shortstop George Myatt in August 1936.\nCollins later explained, \"It wasn't hard to find Ted Williams. He stood out like a brown cow in a field of white cows.\" In the 1937 season, after graduating from Hoover High in the winter, Williams finally broke into the lineup on June 22, when he hit an inside-the-park home run to help the Padres win 3\u20132. The Padres ended up winning the PCL title, while Williams ended up hitting .291 with 23 home runs and 98 RBI in 138 games. Meanwhile, Collins kept in touch with Padres general manager Bill Lane, calling him two times throughout the season. In December 1937, during the winter meetings, the deal was made between Lane and Collins, sending Williams to the Boston Red Sox and giving Lane $35,000 and two major leaguers, Dom D'Allessandro and Al Niemiec, and two other minor leaguers.\nIn 1938, the 19-year-old Williams was 10 days late to spring training camp in Sarasota, Florida, because of a flood in California that blocked the railroads. Williams had to borrow $200 from a bank to make the trip from San Diego to Sarasota. Also during spring training Williams was nicknamed \"the Kid\" by Red Sox equipment manager Johnny Orlando, who after Williams arrived to Sarasota for the first time, said, \"'The Kid' has arrived\". Orlando still called Williams \"the Kid\" 20 years later, and the nickname stuck with Williams the rest of his life. Williams remained in major league spring training for about a week. Williams was then sent to the Double-A-league Minneapolis Millers. While in the Millers training camp for the springtime, Williams met Rogers Hornsby, who had hit over .400 three times, including a .424 average in 1924. Hornsby, who was a coach for the Millers that spring, gave Williams useful advice, including how to \"get a good pitch to hit\". Talking with the game's greats would become a pattern for Williams, who also talked with Hugh Duffy, who hit .438 in 1894, Bill Terry who hit .401 in 1930, and Ty Cobb with whom he would argue that a batter should hit up on the ball, opposed to Cobb's view that a batter should hit down on the ball.\nWhile in Minnesota, Williams quickly became the team's star. He collected his first hit in the Millers' first game of the season, as well as his first and second home runs during his third game. Both were inside-the-park home runs, with the second traveling an estimated on the fly to a center field fence. Williams later had a 22 game hitting streak that lasted from Memorial Day through mid-June. While the Millers ended up sixth place in an eight-team race, Williams ended up hitting .366 with 46 home runs and 142 RBI in 148 games. He received the American Association's Triple Crown and finished second in the voting for Most Valuable Player.\nBoston Red Sox (1939\u20131942, 1946\u20131960).\n1939\u20131940.\nWilliams came to spring training three days late in 1939, thanks to Williams driving from California to Florida, as well as respiratory problems, the latter of which would plague Williams for the rest of his career. In the winter, the Red Sox traded right fielder Ben Chapman to the Cleveland Indians to make room for Williams on the roster, even though Chapman had hit .340 in the previous season. This led \"Boston Globe\" sports journalist Gerry Moore to quip, \"Not since Joe DiMaggio broke in with the Yankees by \"five for five\" in St. Petersburg in 1936 has any baseball rookie received the nationwide publicity that has been accorded this spring to Theodore Francis [\"sic\"] Williams\". Williams inherited Chapman's number 9 on his uniform as opposed to Williams' number 5 in the previous spring training. He made his major league debut against the New York Yankees on April 20, going 1-for-4 against Yankee pitcher Red Ruffing. This was the only game which featured both Williams and Lou Gehrig playing against one another. \nIn his first series at Fenway Park, Williams hit a double, a home run, and a triple, the first two against Cotton Pippen, who gave Williams his first strikeout as a professional while Williams had been in San Diego. By July, Williams was hitting just .280, but leading the league in RBI. Johnny Orlando, now Williams' friend, then gave Williams a quick pep talk, telling Williams that he should hit .335 with 35 home runs and he would drive in 150 runs. Williams said he would buy Orlando a Cadillac if this all came true. In 149 games, Williams batted .327 with 31 home runs and 145 RBI, leading the league in the latter category, the first rookie to lead the league in RBIs and finishing fourth in MVP voting. He also led the AL in walks, with 107, a rookie record. Even though there was not a Rookie of the Year award yet in 1939, Babe Ruth declared Williams to be the Rookie of the Year, which Williams later said was \"good enough for me\".\nWilliams' pay doubled in 1940, going from $5,000 to $10,000. A new bullpen was added in right field of Fenway Park, reducing the distance from home plate from 400 feet to 380 feet and earning the nickname \"Williamsburg\" for being \"obviously designed for Williams\". Williams was then switched from right field to left field, as there would be less sun in his eyes, and it would give Dom DiMaggio a chance to play center. Finally, Williams was flip-flopped in the order with the great slugger Jimmie Foxx, with the idea that Williams would get more pitches to hit. Pitchers, though, proved willing to pitch around the eagle-eyed Williams in favor of facing the 32-year-old Foxx, the reigning AL home run champion, followed by the still highly productive 33-year-old Joe Cronin, the player-manager. Williams also made his first of 16 All-Star Game appearances in 1940, going 0-for-2. Although Williams hit .344, his power and runs batted in were down from the previous season, with 23 home runs and 113 RBI in 144 games played. Williams also caused a controversy in mid-August when he called his salary \"peanuts\", along with saying he hated the city of Boston and reporters, leading reporters to lash back at him, saying that he should be traded. Williams said that the \"only real fun\" he had in 1940 was being able to pitch once on August 24, when he pitched the last two innings in a 12\u20131 loss to the Detroit Tigers, allowing one earned run on three hits, while striking out one batter, Rudy York.\n1941.\nIn the second week of spring training in 1941, Williams broke a bone in his right ankle, limiting him to pinch hitting for the first two weeks of the season. Bobby Doerr later claimed that the injury would be the foundation of Williams' season, as it forced him to put less pressure on his right foot for the rest of the season. Against the Chicago White Sox on May 7, in extra innings, Williams told the Red Sox pitcher, Charlie Wagner, to hold the White Sox, since he was going to hit a home run. In the 11th inning, Williams' prediction came true, as he hit a big blast to help the Red Sox win.\nThe home run is still considered to be the longest home run ever hit in the old Comiskey Park, some saying that it went . Williams' average slowly climbed in the first half of May, and on May 15, he started a 22-game hitting streak. From May 17 to June 1, Williams batted .536, with his season average going above .400 on May 25 and then continuing up to .430. By the All-Star break, Williams was hitting .406 with 16 home runs and 62 RBI.\nIn the 1941 All-Star Game, Williams batted fourth behind Joe DiMaggio, who was in the midst of his record-breaking hitting streak, having hit safely in 48 consecutive games. In the fourth inning Williams doubled to drive in a run. With the National League (NL) leading 5\u20132 in the eighth inning, Williams struck out in the middle of an American League (AL) rally. In the ninth inning the AL still trailed 5\u20133; Ken Keltner and Joe Gordon singled, and Cecil Travis walked to load the bases. DiMaggio grounded to the infield and Billy Herman, attempting to complete a double play, threw wide of first base, allowing Keltner to score. With the score 5\u20134 and runners on first and third, Williams homered with his eyes closed to secure a 7\u20135 AL win. Williams later said that that game-winning home run \"remains to this day the most thrilling hit of my life\".\nIn late August, Williams was hitting .402. Williams said that \"just about everybody was rooting for me\" to hit .400 in the season, including Yankee fans, who gave pitcher Lefty Gomez a \"hell of a boo\" after walking Williams with the bases loaded after Williams had gotten three straight hits one game in September. In mid-September, Williams was hitting .413, but dropped a point a game from then on. Before the final two games on September 28, a doubleheader against the Philadelphia Athletics, he was batting .39955, which would have been officially rounded up to .400. Red Sox manager Joe Cronin offered him the chance to sit out the final day, but he declined. \"If I'm going to be a .400 hitter\", he said at the time, \"I want more than my toenails on the line.\" Williams went 6-for-8 on the day, finishing the season at .406. (Sacrifice flies were counted as at-bats in 1941; under today's rules, Williams would have hit between .411 and .419, based on contemporaneous game accounts.) Philadelphia fans ran out on the field to surround Williams after the game, forcing him to protect his hat from being stolen; he was helped into the clubhouse by his teammates. Along with his .406 average, Williams also hit 37 home runs and recorded 120 RBI in 143 games, missing the Triple Crown by five RBI.\nWilliams' 1941 season is often considered to be the best offensive season of all time, though the MVP award would go to DiMaggio. The .406 batting average\u2014his first of six batting championships\u2014is still the highest single-season average in Red Sox history and the highest batting average in the major leagues since 1924, and the last time any major league player has hit over .400 for a season after averaging at least 3.1 plate appearances per game. (\"If I had known hitting .400 was going to be such a big deal\", he quipped in 1991, \"I would have done it again.\") Williams' on-base percentage of .553 and slugging percentage of .735 that season are both also the highest single-season averages in Red Sox history. The .553 OBP stood as a major league record until it was broken by Barry Bonds in 2002 and his .735 slugging percentage was the highest mark in the major leagues between 1932 and 1994. His OPS of 1.287 that year, a Red Sox record, was the highest in the major leagues between 1923 and 2001. Despite playing in only 143 games that year, Williams led the league with 135 runs scored and 37 home runs, and he finished third with 335 total bases, the most home runs, runs scored, and total bases by a Red Sox player since Jimmie Foxx's in 1938. Williams placed second in MVP voting; DiMaggio won, 291 votes to 254, on the strength of his record-breaking 56-game hitting streak and league-leading 125 RBI.\nU.S. Navy and U.S. Marine Corps.\nIn January 1942, Williams was drafted into the military, being put into Class 1-A. A friend of Williams suggested that Williams see the advisor of the governor's Selective Service Appeal Agent, since Williams was the sole support of his mother, arguing that Williams should not have been placed in Class 1-A, and said Williams should be reclassified to Class 3-A. Williams was reclassified to 3-A ten days later. Afterwards, the public reaction was extremely negative, even though the baseball book \"Season of '42\" states only four All-Stars and one first-line pitcher entered military service during the 1942 season. (Many more MLB players would enter service during the 1943 season.)\nQuaker Oats stopped sponsoring Williams, and Williams, who previously had eaten Quaker products \"all the time\", never \"[ate] one since\" the company stopped sponsoring him. Despite the trouble with the draft board, Williams had a new salary of $30,000 in 1942. In the season, Williams won the Triple Crown, with a .356 batting average, 36 home runs, and 137 RBI in 150 games. On May 21, Williams also hit his 100th career home run. He was the third Red Sox player to hit 100 home runs with the team, following teammates Jimmie Foxx and Joe Cronin. Despite winning the Triple Crown, Williams came in second in the MVP voting, losing to Joe Gordon of the Yankees. Williams felt that he should have gotten a \"little more consideration\" because of winning the Triple Crown, and he thought that \"the reason I didn't get more consideration was because of the trouble I had with the draft [boards]\".\nWilliams joined the Navy Reserve on May 22, 1942, went on active duty in 1943, and was commissioned a second lieutenant in the United States Marine Corps as a naval aviator on May 2, 1944. Williams also played on the baseball team in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, along with his Red Sox teammate Johnny Pesky in pre-flight training, after eight weeks in Amherst, Massachusetts, and the Civilian Pilot Training Course. While on the baseball team, Williams was sent back to Fenway Park on July 12, 1943, to play on an All-Star team managed by Babe Ruth. The newspapers reported that Ruth said when finally meeting Williams, \"Hiya, kid. You remind me a lot of myself. I love to hit. You're one of the most natural ballplayers I've ever seen. And if my record is broken, I hope you're the one to do it\". Williams later said he was \"flabbergasted\" by the incident, as \"after all, it was Babe Ruth\". In the game, Williams hit a 425-foot home run to help give the American League All-Stars a 9\u20138 win.\nService baseball.\nOn September 2, 1945, when the war ended, Lt. Williams was in Pearl Harbor, Hawaii awaiting orders as a replacement pilot. While in Pearl Harbor, Williams played baseball in the Navy League. Also in that eight-team league were Joe DiMaggio, Joe Gordon, and Stan Musial. The Service World Series with the Army versus the Navy attracted crowds of 40,000 for each game. The players said it was even better than the actual World Series being played between the Detroit Tigers and Chicago Cubs that year.\n1946\u20131949.\nWilliams was discharged by the Marine Corps on January 28, 1946, in time to begin preparations for the upcoming pro baseball season. He joined the Red Sox again in 1946, signing a $37,500 contract. On July 14, after Williams hit three home runs and eight RBI in the first game of a doubleheader, Lou Boudreau, inspired by Williams' consistent pull hitting to right field, created what would later be known as the Boudreau shift (also Williams shift) against Williams, having only one player on the left side of second base (the left fielder). Ignoring the shift, Williams walked twice, doubled, and grounded out to the shortstop, who was positioned in between first and second base. Also during 1946, the All-Star Game was held in Fenway Park. In the game, Williams homered in the fourth inning against Kirby Higbe, singled in a run in the fifth inning, singled in the seventh inning, and hit a three-run home run against Rip Sewell's \"eephus pitch\" in the eighth inning to help the American League win 12\u20130.\nFor the 1946 season, Williams hit .342 with 38 home runs and 123 RBI in 150 games, helping the Red Sox win the pennant on September 13, in a 1\u20130 win over Cleveland; Williams hit the only inside-the-park home run in his Major League career for the only run of the game. On June 9, he hit what is considered to be the longest home run in Fenway Park history, at and subsequently marked with a lone red seat in the Fenway bleachers. Williams ran away as the winner in the MVP voting. During an exhibition game in Fenway Park against an All-Star team during early October, Williams was hit on the elbow by a curveball by the Washington Senators' pitcher Mickey Haefner. Williams was immediately taken out of the game, and X-rays of his arm showed no damage, but his arm was \"swelled up like a boiled egg\", according to Williams. Williams could not swing a bat again until four days later, one day before the World Series, when he reported the arm as \"sore\". During the series, Williams batted .200 (5-for-25) with no home runs and just one RBI. The Red Sox lost in seven games. Fifty years later when asked what one thing he would have done different in his life, Williams replied, \"I'd have done better in the '46 World Series. God, I would\". The 1946 World Series was the only World Series Williams ever appeared in.\nWilliams signed a $70,000 contract in 1947. Williams was also almost traded for Joe DiMaggio in 1947. In late April, Red Sox owner Tom Yawkey and Yankees owner Dan Topping agreed to swap the players, but a day later canceled the deal when Yawkey requested that Yogi Berra come with DiMaggio. In May, Williams was hitting .337. Williams won the Triple Crown in 1947, but lost the MVP award to Joe DiMaggio, 202 points to 201 points. One writer left Williams off his ballot. Williams said he thought it was Mel Webb, whom Williams called a \"grouchy old guy\", although it now appears it was not Webb, and three writers left DiMaggio off of their ballots. Williams was the third major league player to have had at least four 30-home run and 100-RBI seasons in their first five years, joining Chuck Klein and Joe DiMaggio, and followed by Ralph Kiner, Mark Teixeira, Albert Pujols, and Ryan Braun through 2011.\nIn 1948, under their new manager, the ex-New York Yankee great skipper Joe McCarthy, Williams hit a league-leading .369 with 25 home runs and 127 RBIs, and was third in MVP voting. On April 29, Williams hit his 200th career home run. He became just the second player to hit 200 home runs in a Red Sox uniform, joining his former teammate Jimmie Foxx. On October 2, against the Yankees, Williams hit his 222nd career home run, tying Foxx for the Red Sox all-time record. In the Red Sox' final two games of the regular schedule, they beat the Yankees (to force a one-game playoff against the Cleveland Indians) and Williams got on base eight times out of ten plate appearances. In the playoff, Williams went 1-for-4, with the Red Sox losing 8\u20133.\nIn 1949, Williams received a new salary of $100,000 ($ in current dollar terms). He hit .343 (losing the AL batting title by just .0002 to the Tigers' George Kell, thus missing the Triple Crown that year), hitting 43 home runs, his career high, and driving in 159 runs, tied for highest in the league, and at one point, he got on base in 84 straight games, an MLB record that still stands today, helping him win the MVP trophy. On April 28, Williams hit his 223rd career home run, breaking the record for most home runs in a Red Sox uniform, passing Jimmie Foxx. Williams is still the Red Sox career home run leader. However, despite being ahead of the Yankees by one game just before a two-game series against them (last regular-season games for both teams), the Red Sox lost both of those games and the Yankees won the pennant. They went on to win the first of what would be five straight World Series titles, beginning with 1949. For the rest of Williams' career, the Yankees won nine pennants and six World Series titles, while the Red Sox never finished better than third place.\n1950\u20131955.\nIn 1950, Williams was playing in his eighth All-Star Game. In the first inning, Williams caught a line drive by Ralph Kiner, slamming into the Comiskey Park scoreboard and breaking his left arm. Williams played the rest of the game, and he even singled in a run to give the American League the lead in the fifth inning, but by that time Williams' arm was a \"balloon\" and he was in great pain, so he left the game. Both of the doctors who X-rayed Williams held little hope for a full recovery. The doctors operated on Williams for two hours. When Williams took his cast off, he could only extend the arm to within four inches of his right arm. Williams only played 89 games in 1950, but managed to hit .317 with 28 home runs and 97 RBI. After the baseball season, Williams' elbow hurt so much he considered retirement, since he thought he would never be able to hit again. Tom Yawkey, the Red Sox owner, then sent Jack Fadden to Williams' Florida home to talk to Williams. Williams later thanked Fadden for saving his career.\nIn 1951, Williams \"struggled\", hitting .318, with his elbow still hurting. Despite this, he played in 148 games, 60 more than in the previous season, while hitting 30 home runs, two more than in 1950, and 126 RBI, 29 more than 1950. Despite his lower-than-usual production at bat, Williams made the All-Star team. On May 15, 1951, Williams became the 11th player in major league history to hit 300 career home runs. On May 21, Williams passed Chuck Klein for 10th place, on May 25 Williams passed Hornsby for ninth place, and on July 5 Williams passed Al Simmons for eighth place all-time in career home runs. After the season, manager Steve O'Neill was fired, with Lou Boudreau replacing him. Boudreau's first announcement as manager was that all Red Sox players were \"expendable\", including Williams.\nWilliams' name was called from a list of inactive reserves to serve on active duty in the Korean War on January 9, 1952. Williams, who was livid at his recalling, had a physical scheduled for April 2. Williams passed his physical and in May, after only playing in six major league games, began refresher flight training and qualification prior to service in Korea. Right before he left for Korea, the Red Sox had a \"Ted Williams Day\" in Fenway Park. Friends of Williams gave him a Cadillac, and the Red Sox gave Williams a memory book that was signed by 400,000 fans. The governor of Massachusetts and mayor of Boston were there, along with a Korean War veteran named Frederick Wolf who used a wheelchair for mobility. At the end of the ceremony, everyone in the park held hands and sang \"Auld Lang Syne\" to Williams, a moment which he later said \"moved me quite a bit.\" Private Wolf (an injured Korean veteran from Brooklyn) presented gifts from wounded veterans to Ted Williams. Ted choked and was only able to say,\"... ok kid\u00a0...\". The Red Sox went on to win the game 5\u20133, thanks to a two-run home run by Williams in the seventh inning.\nIn August 1953, Williams practiced with the Red Sox for ten days before playing in his first game, garnering a large ovation from the crowd and hitting a home run in the eighth inning. In the season, Williams ended up hitting .407 with 13 home runs and 34 RBIs in 37 games and 110 at bats (not nearly enough plate appearances to qualify for that season's batting title). On September 6, Williams hit his 332nd career home run, passing Hank Greenberg for seventh all-time.\nOn the first day of spring training in 1954, Williams broke his collarbone running after a line drive. Williams was out for six weeks, and in April he wrote an article with Joe Reichler of the \"Saturday Evening Post\" saying that he intended to retire at the end of the season. Williams returned to the Red Sox lineup on May 7, and he hit .345 with 29 home runs and 89 RBI across 386 at bats in 117 games, although Bobby \u00c1vila, who had hit .341, won the batting championship. This was because it was required then that a batter needed 400 at bats, despite Lou Boudreau's attempt to bat Williams second in the lineup to get more at-bats. Williams led the league in base on balls with 136 which kept him from qualifying under the rules at the time. By today's standards (plate appearances) he would have been the champion. The rule was changed shortly thereafter to keep this from happening again. On August 25, Williams passed Johnny Mize for sixth place, and on September 3, Williams passed Joe DiMaggio for fifth all-time in career home runs with his 362nd career home run. He finished the season with 366 career home runs. On September 26, Williams \"retired\" after the Red Sox's final game of the season.\nDuring the off-season of 1954, Williams was offered the chance to be manager of the Red Sox. Williams declined, and he suggested that Pinky Higgins, who had previously played on the 1946 Red Sox team as the third baseman, become the manager of the team. Higgins later was hired as the Red Sox manager in 1955. Williams sat out the first month of the 1955 season due to a divorce settlement with his wife, Doris. When Williams returned, he signed a $98,000 contract on May 13. Williams batted .356 in 320 at bats on the season, hitting 28 home runs and driving in 83 runs in 98 games. For his performance, he was named the \"Comeback Player of the Year.\"\n1956\u20131960.\nOn July 17 1956, Williams became the fifth player to hit 400 home runs, following Mel Ott in 1941, Jimmie Foxx in 1938, Lou Gehrig in 1936, and Babe Ruth in 1927. Three weeks later at home against the Yankees on August\u00a07, after Williams was booed for dropping a fly ball from Mickey Mantle, he spat at one of the fans who was taunting him on the top of the dugout; Williams was fined $5,000 for the incident. The following night against Baltimore, Williams was greeted by a large ovation, and received an even larger one when he hit a home run in the sixth inning to break a 2\u20132 tie. In the \"Boston Globe\", the publishers ran a \"What Globe Readers Say About Ted\" section made out of letters about Williams, which were either the sportswriters or the \"loud mouths\" in the stands. Williams explained years later, \"From '56 on, I realized that people were for me. The writers had written that the fans should show me they didn't want me, and I got the biggest ovation yet\". Williams lost the batting title to Mickey Mantle in 1956, batting .345 to Mantle's .353, with Mantle on his way to winning the Triple Crown.\nIn 1957, Williams batted .388 to lead the majors, then signed a contract in February 1958 for a record high $125,000 (or $135,000). At age forty that season, he again led the American League with a .328 batting average, and also hit 26 home runs and 85 RBI in 129 games.\nWhen Pumpsie Green became the first black player on the Red Sox\u2014the last major league team to integrate\u2014in 1959, Williams openly welcomed Green.\nWilliams ended his career with a home run in his last at-bat on September 28, 1960. He refused to salute the fans as he returned to the dugout after he crossed home plate or after he was replaced in left field by Carroll Hardy. An essay written by John Updike the following month for \"The New Yorker\", \"Hub Fans Bid Kid Adieu\", chronicles this event.\nCareer overall.\nAt the time of his retirement, Williams ranked third all-time in home runs (behind Babe Ruth and Jimmie Foxx), seventh in RBIs (after Ruth, Cap Anson, Lou Gehrig, Ty Cobb, Foxx, and Mel Ott), and seventh in batting average (behind Cobb, Rogers Hornsby, Shoeless Joe Jackson, Lefty O'Doul, Ed Delahanty and Tris Speaker). His career batting average of .3444 is the highest of any player who played his entire career in the live-ball era following 1920.\nMost modern statistical analyses place Williams, along with Ruth and Barry Bonds, among the three most potent hitters to have played the game. Williams' baseball season of 1941 is often considered favorably with the greatest seasons of Ruth and Bonds in terms of various offensive statistical measures such as slugging, on-base and \"offensive winning percentage.\"\nWilliams is one of only 29 players in baseball history to date to have appeared in Major League games in four decades.\nNote: Bold indicates all-time MLB leader in category.\nPlayer profile.\nPlaying style.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n\"All I want out of life is that when I walk down the street, folks will say, 'There goes the greatest hitter who ever lived'.\"\n \u2014 Ted Williams.\nWilliams was an obsessive student of hitting. He famously used a lighter bat than most sluggers, because it generated a faster swing. In 1970, he wrote a book on the subject, \"The Science of Hitting\" (revised 1986), which is still read by many baseball players. The book describes his theory of swinging only at pitches that came into ideal areas of his strike zone, a strategy Williams credited with his success as a hitter; as a result, Williams' bases-on-balls-to-plate-appearances ratio (.2065) is the highest of any player in the Hall of Fame.\nWilliams nearly always took the first pitch.\nHe helped pass his expertise of playing left-field in front of the Green Monster to his successor on the Red Sox, Carl Yastrzemski.\nRelationship with Boston media and fans.\nWilliams was on uncomfortable terms with the Boston newspapers for nearly twenty years, as he felt they liked to discuss his personal life as much as his baseball performance. He maintained a career-long feud with \"Sport\" due to a 1948 feature article in which the reporter included a quote from Williams' mother. Insecure about his upbringing, and stubborn because of immense confidence in his own talent, Williams made up his mind that the \"knights of the keyboard\", as he derisively labeled the press, were against him. After having hit for the league's Triple Crown in 1947, Williams narrowly lost the MVP award in a vote where one Midwestern newspaper writer left Williams entirely off his ten-player ballot.\nDuring his career, some sportswriters also criticized aspects of Williams' baseball performance, including what they viewed as his lackadaisical fielding and lack of clutch hitting. Williams pushed back, saying: \"They're always saying that I don't hit in the clutches. Well, there are a lot [of games] when I do.\" He also asserted that it made no sense crashing into an outfield wall to try to make a difficult catch because of the risk of injury or being out of position to make the play after missing the ball.\nWilliams treated most of the press accordingly, as he described in his 1969 memoir \"My Turn at Bat\". Williams also had an uneasy relationship with the Boston fans, though he could be very cordial one-to-one. He felt at times a good deal of gratitude for their passion and their knowledge of the game. On the other hand, Williams was temperamental, high-strung, and at times tactless. In his biography, Ronald Reis relates how Williams committed two fielding miscues in a doubleheader in 1950 and was roundly booed by Boston fans. He bowed three times to various sections of Fenway Park and made an obscene gesture. When he came to bat he spat in the direction of fans near the dugout. The incident caused an avalanche of negative media reaction, and inspired sportswriter Austen Lake's famous comment that when Williams' name was announced the sound was like \"autumn wind moaning through an apple orchard.\"\nAnother incident occurred in 1958 in a game against the Washington Senators. Williams struck out, and as he stepped from the batter's box swung his bat violently in anger. The bat slipped from his hands, was launched into the stands and struck a 60-year-old woman who turned out to be the housekeeper of the Red Sox general manager Joe Cronin. While the incident was an accident and Williams apologized to the woman personally, to all appearances it seemed at the time that Williams had hurled the bat in a fit of temper.\nWilliams gave generously to those in need. He was especially linked with the Jimmy Fund of the Dana\u2013Farber Cancer Institute, which provides support for children's cancer research and treatment. Williams used his celebrity to virtually launch the fund, which raised more than $750\u00a0million between 1948 and 2010. Throughout his career, Williams made countless bedside visits to children being treated for cancer, which Williams insisted go unreported. Often parents of sick children would learn at check-out time that \"Mr. Williams has taken care of your bill\". The Fund recently stated that \"Williams would travel everywhere and anywhere, no strings or paychecks attached, to support the cause... His name is synonymous with our battle against all forms of cancer.\"\nWilliams demanded loyalty from those around him. He could not forgive the fickle nature of the fans\u2014booing a player for booting a ground ball, and then turning around and roaring approval of the same player for hitting a home run. Despite the cheers and adulation of most of his fans, the occasional boos directed at him in Fenway Park led Williams to stop tipping his cap in acknowledgment after a home run.\nWilliams maintained this policy up to and including his swan song in 1960. After hitting a home run at Fenway Park, which would be his last career at-bat, Williams characteristically refused either to tip his cap as he circled the bases or to respond to prolonged cheers of \"We want Ted!\" from the crowd by making an appearance from the dugout. The Boston manager Pinky Higgins sent Williams to his fielding position in left field to start the ninth inning, but then immediately recalled him for his back-up Carroll Hardy, thus allowing Williams to receive one last ovation as he jogged onto then off the field, and he did so without reacting to the crowd. Williams' aloof attitude led the writer John Updike to observe wryly that \"Gods do not answer letters.\"\nWilliams' final home run did not take place during the final game of the 1960 season, but rather in the Red Sox's last home game that year. The Red Sox played three more games, but they were on the road in New York City and Williams did not appear in any of them, as it became clear that Williams' final home at-bat would be the last one of his career.\nIn 1991, on Ted Williams Day at Fenway Park, Williams pulled a Red Sox cap from out of his jacket and tipped it to the crowd. This was the first time that he had done so since his earliest days as a player.\nWilliams once had a friendship with Ty Cobb, with whom he often had discussions about baseball. He often touted Rogers Hornsby as being the greatest right-handed hitter of all time. In Al Stump's now discredited biography about Cobb, he claimed that this assertion actually led to a split in the relationship between Cobb and Williams. Once during one of their yearly debate sessions on the greatest hitters of all time, Williams asserted that Hornsby was one of the greatest of all time. Cobb apparently had strong feelings about Hornsby and he threw a fit, expelling Williams from his hotel room. However, this story was later refuted by Williams himself.\nMilitary service.\nWorld War II.\nWilliams served as a Naval Aviator during World War II and the Korean War. Unlike many other major league players, he did not spend all of his war-time playing on service teams. Williams had been classified 3-A by Selective Service prior to the war, a dependency deferment because he was his mother's sole means of financial support. When his classification was changed to 1-A following the American entry into World War II, Williams appealed to his local draft board. The draft board ruled that his draft status should not have been changed. He made a public statement that once he had built up his mother's trust fund, he intended to enlist. Even so, criticism in the media, including withdrawal of an endorsement contract by Quaker Oats, resulted in his enlistment in the U.S. Naval Reserve on May 22, 1942.\nWilliams did not opt for an easy assignment playing baseball for the Navy, but rather joined the V-5 program to become a Naval aviator. Williams was first sent to the Navy's Preliminary Ground School at Amherst College for six months of academic instruction in various subjects including math and navigation, where he achieved a 3.85 grade point average.\nWilliams was talented as a pilot, and so enjoyed it that he had to be ordered by the Navy to leave training to personally accept his American League 1942 Major League Baseball Triple Crown. Williams' Red Sox teammate, Johnny Pesky, who went into the same aviation training program, said this about Williams: \"He mastered intricate problems in fifteen minutes which took the average cadet an hour, and half of the other cadets there were college grads.\" Pesky again described Williams' acumen in the advanced training, for which Pesky personally did not qualify: \"I heard Ted literally tore the sleeve target to shreds with his angle dives. He'd shoot from wingovers, zooms, and barrel rolls, and after a few passes the sleeve was ribbons. At any rate, I know he broke the all-time record for hits.\" Ted went to Jacksonville for a course in aerial gunnery, the combat pilot's payoff test, and broke all the records in reflexes, coordination, and visual-reaction time. \"From what I heard. Ted could make a plane and its six 'pianos' (machine guns) play like a symphony orchestra\", Pesky says. \"From what they said, his reflexes, coordination, and visual reaction made him a built-in part of the machine.\"\nWilliams completed pre-flight training in Athens, Georgia, his primary training at NAS Bunker Hill, Indiana, and his advanced flight training at NAS Pensacola. He received his gold Naval Aviator wings and his commission as a second lieutenant in the U.S. Marine Corps on May 2, 1944.\nWilliams served as a flight instructor at NAS Pensacola teaching young pilots to fly the complicated F4U Corsair fighter plane. Williams was in Pearl Harbor awaiting orders to join the Fleet in the Western Pacific when the War in the Pacific ended. He finished the war in Hawaii, and then he was released from active duty on January 12, 1946, but he did remain in the Marine Corps Reserve.\nKorean War.\nOn May 1, 1952, 14 months after his promotion to captain in the Marine Corps Reserve, Williams was recalled to active duty for service in the Korean War. He had not flown any aircraft for eight years but he turned down all offers to sit out the war in comfort as a member of a service baseball team. Nevertheless, Williams was resentful of being called up, which he admitted years later, particularly regarding the Navy's policy of calling up Inactive Reservists rather than members of the Active Reserve.\nWilliams reported for duty on May 2, 1952. After eight weeks of refresher flight training and qualification in the F9F Panther jet fighter with VMF-223 at the Marine Corps Air Station Cherry Point, North Carolina, Williams was assigned to VMF-311, Marine Aircraft Group 33 (MAG-33), based at the K-3 airfield in Pohang, South Korea.\nOn February 16, 1953, Williams, flying as the wingman for John Glenn (who would become the first American to orbit the earth), was part of a 35-plane raid against a tank and infantry training school just south of Pyongyang, North Korea. As the aircraft from VMF-115 and VMF-311 dove on the target, Williams' plane was hit by anti-aircraft fire, a piece of flak knocked out his hydraulics and electrical systems, causing Williams to have to \"limp\" his plane back to K-3 air base where he made a belly landing. For his actions of this day, he was awarded the Air Medal.\nWilliams flew 39 combat missions in Korea, earning the Air Medal with two Gold Stars representing second and third awards, before being withdrawn from flight status in June 1953 after a hospitalization for pneumonia. This resulted in the discovery of an inner ear infection that disqualified him from flight status. John Glenn described Williams as one of the best pilots he knew. In the last half of his missions, Williams was flying as Glenn's wingman.\nWilliams likely would have exceeded 600 career home runs if he had not served in the military, and might even have approached Babe Ruth's then record of 714. He might have set the record for career RBIs as well, exceeding Hank Aaron's total. While the absences in the Marine Corps took almost five years out of his baseball career, he never publicly complained about the time devoted to service in the Marine Corps. His biographer, Leigh Montville, argued that Williams was not happy about being pressed into service in South Korea, but he did what he thought was his patriotic duty.\nFollowing his return to the United States in August 1953, he resigned his Reserve commission to resume his baseball career.\nPost-retirement.\nAfter retirement from play, Williams helped Boston's new left fielder, Carl Yastrzemski, in hitting, and was a regular visitor to the Red Sox' spring training camps from 1961 to 1966, where he worked as a special batting instructor. He served as executive assistant to Tom Yawkey (1961\u201365), then was named a team vice president (1965\u201368) upon his election to the Hall of Fame. He resumed his spring training instruction role with the club in 1978.\nBeginning in 1961, he would spend summers at the Ted Williams Baseball Camp in Lakeville, Massachusetts, which he had established in 1958 with his friend Al Cassidy and two other business partners. For eight summers and parts of others after that, he would give hitting clinics and talk baseball at the camp. It was not uncommon to find Williams fishing in the pond at the camp. The area now is owned by the town and a few of the buildings still stand. In the main lodge one can still see memorabilia from Williams' playing days.\nWilliams served as manager of the Washington Senators, from 1969\u20131971, then continued with the team when they became the Texas Rangers after the 1971 season. Williams' best season as a manager was 1969 when he led the expansion Senators to an 86\u201376 record in the team's only winning season in Washington. He was chosen \"Manager of the Year\" after that season. Like many great players, Williams became impatient with ordinary athletes' abilities and attitudes, particularly those of pitchers, whom he admitted he never respected. Fellow manager Alvin Dark thought Williams \"was a smart, fearless manager\" who helped his hitters perform better. Williams' issue with Washington/Texas, according to Dark, was when the ownership traded away his third baseman and shortstop, making it difficult for the club to be as competitive.\nOn the subject of pitchers, in Ted's autobiography written with John Underwood, Ted opines regarding Bob Lemon (a sinker-ball specialist) pitching for the Cleveland Indians around 1951: \"I have to rate Lemon as one of the very best pitchers I ever faced. His ball was always moving, hard, sinking, fast-breaking. You could never really uhmmmph with Lemon.\"\nWilliams was much more successful in fishing. An avid and expert fly fisherman and deep-sea fisherman, he spent many summers after baseball fishing the Miramichi River, in Miramichi, New Brunswick. Williams was named to the International Game Fish Association Hall of Fame in 2000. Williams was also known as an accomplished hunter; he was fond of pigeon-shooting for sport in Fenway Park during his career, on one occasion drawing the ire of the Massachusetts Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.\nWilliams reached an extensive deal with Sears, lending his name and talent toward marketing, developing, and endorsing a line of in-house sports equipment\u2014such as the \"Ted Williams\" edition Gamefisher aluminum boat and 7.5\u00a0hp \"Ted Williams\" edition motor, as well as fishing, hunting, and baseball equipment. Williams continued his involvement in the Jimmy Fund, later losing a brother to leukemia, and spending much of his spare time, effort, and money in support of the cancer organization.\nIn his later years, Williams became a fixture at autograph shows and card shows after his son (by his third wife), John Henry Williams, took control of his career, becoming his de facto manager. The younger Williams kept his father constantly signing memorabilia as a way to maximize earnings.\nOne of Williams' final, and most memorable, public appearances was at the 1999 All-Star Game in Boston. Able to walk only a short distance, Williams was brought to the pitcher's mound in a golf cart. He proudly waved his cap to the crowd\u2014a gesture he had never done as a player. Fans responded with a standing ovation that lasted several minutes. At the pitcher's mound he was surrounded by players from both teams, including fellow Red Sox player Nomar Garciaparra, and was assisted by Tony Gwynn in throwing out the first pitch of that year's All-Star Game. Later in the year, he was among the members of the Major League Baseball All-Century Team introduced to the crowd at Turner Field in Atlanta prior to Game 2 of the World Series.\nPersonal life.\nOn May 4, 1944, Williams married Doris Soule, the daughter of his hunting guide. Their daughter, Barbara Joyce (\"Bobby-Jo\"), was born on January 28, 1948, while Williams was fishing in Florida. They divorced in 1954. Williams married the socialite model Lee Howard on September 10, 1961, and they were divorced in 1967.\nWilliams married Dolores Wettach, a former Miss Vermont and \"Vogue\" model, in 1968. Their son John-Henry was born on August 27, 1968, followed by daughter Claudia, on October 8, 1971. They were divorced in 1972.\nWilliams lived with Louise Kaufman for twenty years until her death in 1993. In his book, Cramer called her the love of Williams' life. After his death, her sons filed suit to recover her furniture from Williams' condominium as well as a half-interest in the condominium they claimed he gave her.\nWilliams had a strong respect for General Douglas MacArthur, referring to him as his \"idol\". For Williams' 40th birthday, MacArthur sent him an oil painting of himself with the inscription \"To Ted Williams\u2014not only America's greatest baseball player, but a great American who served his country. Your friend, Douglas MacArthur. General U.S. Army.\"\nPolitically, Williams was a Republican, and was described by one biographer as, \"to the right of Attila the Hun\" except when it came to civil rights. Another writer similarly noted that while in the 1960s he had a liberal attitude on civil rights, he was pretty far right on other cultural issues of the time, calling him \"ultraconservative in the tradition of Barry Goldwater and John Wayne\u201d.\nWilliams campaigned for Richard Nixon in the 1960 United States Presidential Election, and after Nixon lost to John F. Kennedy, refused several invitations from President Kennedy to gather together in Cape Cod. He supported Nixon again in 1968, and as manager of the Senators, kept a picture of him on his desk, meeting with the President several times while managing the team. In 1972 he called Nixon, \"the greatest president of my lifetime\". In the following years, Williams endorsed several other candidates in Republican Party presidential primaries, including George H. W. Bush in 1988 (whom he also campaigned for in New Hampshire), Bob Dole in 1996, and George W. Bush in 2000.\nWilliams was called an atheist by several biographers, though Williams disproved this in his autobiography by stating that he did believe in God. He was raised in a Christian household but did not publicly emphasize his religious beliefs throughout his life. He often described himself as a spiritual person. His experiences during World War II, particularly his time as a Marine pilot, may have influenced his views on life and faith. In numerous interviews and his autobiography, Williams refers to God and his strained relationship with theism due to his mother's constant work with the church. As quoted in his autobiography \"My Turn at Bat\", Williams stated: \"I have a God given talent. God gets you to the plate, but it's up to you what happens when you get there\". He concludes his sentiment later with \"I'm not a religious man, but I do believe in God. I believe that he has given me a gift, and I try to use it as best I can.\"\nWilliams' brother Danny and his son John-Henry both died of leukemia.\nDeath.\nIn his last years, Williams suffered from cardiomyopathy. He had a pacemaker implanted in November 2000, and he underwent open-heart surgery in January 2001. After suffering a series of strokes and congestive heart failure, he died of cardiac arrest at the age of 83 on July 5, 2002, at Citrus Memorial Hospital, Inverness, Florida, near his home in Citrus Hills, Florida.\nThough his will stated his desire to be cremated and his ashes scattered in the Florida Keys, Williams' son John-Henry and younger daughter Claudia chose to have his remains frozen cryonically.\nTed's elder daughter, Bobby-Jo Ferrell, brought a suit to have her father's wishes recognized. John-Henry's lawyer then produced an informal \"family pact\" signed by Ted, Claudia, and John-Henry, in which they agreed \"to be put into biostasis after we die\" to \"be able to be together in the future, even if it is only a chance.\" Bobby-Jo and her attorney, Spike Fitzpatrick (former attorney of Ted Williams), contended that the family pact, which was scribbled on an ink-stained napkin, was forged by John-Henry and/or Claudia. Fitzpatrick and Ferrell believed that the signature was not obtained legally. Laboratory analysis proved that the signature was genuine. John-Henry said that his father was a believer in science and was willing to try cryonics if it held the possibility of reuniting the family.\nThough the family pact upset some friends, family and fans, a public plea for financial support of the lawsuit by Ferrell produced little result. Citing financial difficulties, Ferrell dropped her lawsuit on the condition that a $645,000 trust fund left by Williams would immediately pay the sum out equally to the three children.\nIn \"Ted Williams: The Biography of an American Hero\", author Leigh Montville claims that the family cryonics pact was a practice Ted Williams autograph on a plain piece of paper, around which the agreement had later been handwritten. The pact document was signed \"\"Ted Williams\", the same as his autographs, whereas he would always sign his legal documents \"Theodore Williams\"\", according to Montville. However, his daughter Claudia who was part of the pact with John Henry, testified to the authenticity of the document in an affidavit.\nWilliams' body was subsequently decapitated for the neuropreservation option from Alcor. Following John-Henry's unexpected illness and death from acute myeloid leukemia on March 6, 2004, his body was also transported to Alcor, in fulfillment of the family agreement.\nAwards and recognition.\nWilliams was named \"The Sporting News\" MLB Player of the Year in 1941, 1942, 1947, 1949, and 1957, and was honored as the Associated Press Athlete of the Year in 1957.\nIn 1954, Williams was inducted by the San Diego Hall of Champions into the Breitbard Hall of Fame honoring San Diego's finest athletes both on and off the playing surface. In 2002, he was elected to the Hispanic Heritage Baseball Museum Hall of Fame.\nIn 1999, Williams was ranked as number 8 on \"The Sporting News\" list of the 100 Greatest Baseball Players, where he was the highest-ranking left fielder. That same year, he was one of 30 players elected to the Major League Baseball All-Century Team. In 2020, \"The Athletic\" ranked Williams at number 6 on its \"Baseball 100\" list, complied by sportswriter Joe Posnanski. In 2022, as part of their SN Rushmore project, \"The Sporting News\" named Williams on their \"Boston Mount Rushmore of Sports\", along Boston Celtics basketball player Bill Russell, Boston Bruins hockey player Bobby Orr, and New England Patriots football player Tom Brady.\nWilliams was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame on July 25, 1966. In his induction speech, Williams included a statement calling for the recognition of the great Negro leagues players: \"I've been a very lucky guy to have worn a baseball uniform, and I hope some day the names of Satchel Paige and Josh Gibson in some way can be added as a symbol of the great Negro players who are not here only because they weren't given a chance.\" Williams was referring to two of the most famous names in the Negro leagues, who were not given the opportunity to play in the Major Leagues before Jackie Robinson broke the color barrier in 1947. Gibson died early in 1947 and thus never played in the majors; and Paige's brief major league stint came long past his prime as a player. This statement from the Hall of Fame podium was \"a first crack in the door that ultimately would open and include Paige and Gibson and other Negro league stars in the shrine.\" Paige was the first inducted in 1971. Gibson and others followed, starting in 1972 and continued on and off into the 21st century.\nOn November 18, 1991, President George H. W. Bush presented Williams with the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest civilian award in the United States.\nThe Ted Williams Tunnel in Boston, Massachusetts, carrying of the final of Interstate 90 under Boston Harbor, opened in December 1995, and Ted Williams Parkway (California State Route 56) in San Diego County, California, opened in 1992, were named in his honor while he was still alive. In 2016, the major league San Diego Padres inducted Williams into their hall of fame for his contributions to baseball in San Diego.\nOutside Fenway Park, there are two statues honoring Williams. The first was unveiled in 2004, depicting him placing his cap on the head of a young boy. The second was \"The Teammates\" statue, unveiled in 2010, where he is depicted alongside teammates and friends Bobby Doerr, Dom DiMaggio, and Johnny Pesky.\nThe Tampa Bay Rays home field, Tropicana Field, installed the Ted Williams Museum (formerly in Hernando, Florida, 1994\u20132006) behind the left field fence. From the Tampa Bay Rays website: \"The Ted Williams Museum and Hitters Hall of Fame brings a special element to the Tropicana Field. Fans can view an array of different artifacts and pictures of the 'Greatest hitter that ever lived.' These memorable displays range from Ted Williams' days in the military through his professional playing career. This museum is dedicated to some of the greatest players to ever 'lace 'em up,' including Willie Mays, Joe DiMaggio, Mickey Mantle, Roger Maris.\"\nIn 2013, the Bob Feller Act of Valor Award honored Williams as one of 37 Baseball Hall of Fame members for his service in the United States Marine Corps during World War II.\nMilitary and civilian decorations and awards.\nWilliams received the following decorations and awards:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBook sources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The group's early line-up consisted of Ari Up (Ariane Forster) and Palmolive (a.k.a. Paloma Romero, who played briefly with Spizzenergi and later left to join the Raincoats), with Viv Albertine and Tessa Pollitt replacing founding members Kate Korus and Suzy Gutsy. Their 1979 debut album, \"Cut\", has been called one of the defining releases of the post-punk era.\nCareer.\n1976\u20131982.\nThe Slits formed in October 1976 when Ari Up went to a Patti Smith gig at the Hammersmith Odeon in London. After having an argument with her mother, Ari was approached by Palmolive and Kate Korus with the offer to form a band. The next day they had their first rehearsal.\nThe group supported the Clash on their 1977 \"White Riot\" tour along with Buzzcocks, the Jam, the Prefects and Subway Sect. Club performances of the Slits during this period are included in \"The Punk Rock Movie\" (1978). In November 1978, the Slits toured with the Clash again on the \"Sort it Out Tour\" and were joined by the Innocents who opened the shows. Joe Strummer said the group would be \"great\" with intense gigging.\nPalmolive left the band in 1978 and debuted with the Raincoats on 4 January 1979. She was replaced by the drummer Budgie (Peter Clarke), formerly of the Spitfire Boys and later of Siouxsie and the Banshees. With the change of drummer came a change of musical style. The Slits' originally raw, raucous and drum-dominated live sound, as captured on two Peel Sessions in 1977 and 1978, was cleaned up and polished to a more bass-orientated sound with the Budgie line-up, and their new style drew heavily from reggae, dub and world music.\nTheir Dennis Bovell-produced debut album \"Cut\" was released in September 1979 on Island Records, with Neneh Cherry joining as additional backing vocalist. The album's sleeve art depicted the band naked, except for mud and loincloths. It is often claimed that Palmolive left partly because she did not like the album artwork, including by Palmolive herself, but Viv Albertine has stated that Palmolive had been asked to leave the band several months previously, and she does not appear on the record.\nThe Slits' sound and attitude became increasingly experimental and avant-garde during the early 1980s, when they formed an alliance with Bristol post-punk band the Pop Group, sharing drummer Bruce Smith and releasing a joint single, \"In the Beginning There Was Rhythm / Where There's a Will...\" (Y Records). This was followed by an untitled compilation album of mostly homemade demos and live performances from before the release of \"Cut\". The band toured widely and released their second studio album, \"Return of the Giant Slits\", before breaking up in early 1982. Ari Up went on to be part of the New Age Steppers.\n2005\u20132010.\nAri Up and Tessa Pollitt reformed the band with new members in 2005, as Viv Albertine was unwilling to rejoin, and in 2006 released the EP \"Revenge of the Killer Slits\". The EP featured former Sex Pistols member Paul Cook and former Adam and the Ants members Chris Constantinou and Marco Pirroni as both musicians and co-producers. Cook's daughter Hollie played with the band, singing and playing keyboards. Other members of the reformed band were No (of the Home Office) on guitar, German drummer Anna Schulte, and Adele Wilson on guitar.\nThe band toured the United States for the first time in twenty-five years during 2006's 'States of Mind' tour, and followed this with tours of Australia and Japan, as well as opening for Sonic Youth at New York's McCarren Park Pool. Adele Wilson and No left the band, to be replaced by American guitarist Michelle Hill. A biography \u2013 \"Typical Girls? The Story of the Slits\" by Zo\u00eb Street Howe was published in the UK by Omnibus Press in July 2009, and the band's third full-length album entitled \"Trapped Animal\" was released three months later. \nFounding member Ari Up died in Los Angeles in October 2010 at the age of 48. The band's final work, the video for the song \"Lazy Slam\" from \"Trapped Animal\", was released posthumously according to Ari Up's wishes. A final song, the unreleased 1981 recording \"Coulda Woulda Shoulda\", was due to be released in early 2011.\nPersonnel.\nMembers.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-begin/styles.css\"/&gt;\nDocumentary.\nIn 2018, a documentary film about the band, \"Here To Be Heard: The Story of the Slits\", was released.\nIn popular culture.\nThe band\u2019s name appears in the lyrics of the Le Tigre song \"Hot Topic\".\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Sister-inline/styles.css\"/&gt; Media related to at Wikimedia Commons"}
{"id": "31500", "revid": "34434225", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31500", "title": "Turners", "text": "German-American gymnastic club members\nTurners (, ) are members of German-American gymnastic clubs called Turnvereine. They promoted German culture, physical culture, and liberal politics. Turners, especially Francis Lieber, were the leading sponsors of gymnastics as an American sport and the field of academic study.\nIn Germany, a major gymnastic movement was started by \"Turnvater\" (\"father of gymnastics\") and nationalist Friedrich Ludwig Jahn in the early 19th century when Germany was occupied by Napoleon. The \"Turnvereine\" (; \"gymnastic unions\"; from German \"turnen\" meaning \"to practice gymnastics\" and \"Verein\" meaning \"club, union\") were not only athletic but also political, reflecting their origin in similar ethnocentric \"national gymnastic\" organizations in Europe (such as the Czech Sokol), who participated in various national movements for independence. The Turner movement in Germany was generally liberal in nature, and many Turners took part in the Revolutions of 1848.\nAfter the failure of the 1848 Revolution in Germany, the Turner movement was suppressed, and many Turners left Germany, some for the United States, especially the Ohio Valley region, Wisconsin, Missouri, and Texas. Several of these Forty-Eighters became Union soldiers and some became Republican politicians. Besides serving as physical education, social, political, and cultural organizations for German immigrants, Turners were also active in public education and labor movements. They were leading promoters of gymnastics in the U.S. as a sport and a school subject. In the U.S., the movement declined after 1900, and especially after 1917.\nHistory in the United States.\nThe Turner movement was preceded by the first wave of gymnastics in the U.S. in the 1820s, led by Germans such as Charles Beck and Charles Follen and Americans such as John Neal. Beck opened the first gymnasium in the U.S. in 1825 at the Round Hill School in Northampton, Massachusetts. Follen opened the first college gymnasium and the first public gymnasium in the States in 1826 at Harvard College and in Boston, Massachusetts, respectively. Neal was the first American to open a public gymnasium in the U.S., in Portland, Maine, in 1827. He documented and promoted these early efforts in the \"American Journal of Education\" and \"The Yankee\", helping to establish the American branch of the movement.\nThe \"Turnvereine\" contributed to German-Americans' integration into their new home. They still exist in areas of heavy German immigration, such as Iowa, Texas, Wisconsin, Indiana, Ohio, Minnesota, Missouri, Syracuse, New York, Kentucky, New York City, Sacramento, and Los Angeles.\nAbout 1,000 Turners served as Union soldiers during the Civil War. Anti-slavery was a common element, as typified by Carl Schurz. Many Republican leaders in German communities were members. They provided the bodyguard at Abraham Lincoln's inauguration on March 4, 1861, and at his funeral in April 1865. In the Camp Jackson Affair, a large force of German volunteers helped prevent Confederate forces from seizing the government arsenal in St. Louis just before the war began. After the war, the national organization took a new name, \"Nordamerikanischer Turnerbund\", and supported German-language teaching in public high schools, as well as gymnastics. Women's auxiliaries formed in the 1850s and 1860s. The high point in membership came in 1894, with 317 societies and about 40,000 adult male members, along with 25,000 children and 3,000 women.\nIn the 1904 Olympics, several competitors represented Turners organizations in Missouri, Illinois, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and New York, and some Olympic teams were sponsored by Turners.\nLike other German-American groups, the Turners experienced suspicion during World War I, even though they no longer had much contact with Germany. German-language instruction ended at many schools and universities, and the federal government imposed restrictions on German-language publications. The younger generation generally demanded the switch to exclusive use of English society affairs, which allowed many Turner societies to continue to function.\nCultural assimilation and both World Wars with Germany took a gradual toll on membership, with some halls closing and others becoming regular dance halls, bars, or bowling alleys. As of 2011, 54 Turner societies remained in the U.S. The American Turners' headquarters is in Louisville, Kentucky.\nIn 1948, the US Post Office issued a 3-cent commemorative stamp to mark the 100th anniversary of the movement in the country.\nThe Turnverein in Sacramento, founded in 1854, claims to be the oldest institution in the city still in existence. The Turnverein Vorwaerts of Fort Wayne, Indiana, owned the Hugh McCulloch House from 1906 to 1966. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Known for pioneering Goth culture in the American film industry, Burton is famous for his gothic horror and dark fantasy films, his distinctive Burtonesque style, which blends gothic aesthetics with whimsical and surreal elements. He has received numerous accolades including an Emmy Award as well as nominations for two Academy Awards, a Golden Globe Award and three BAFTA Awards. He was honored with the Venice International Film Festival's Golden Lion for Lifetime Achievement in 2007 and was given the Order of Arts and Letters by Culture Minister of France in 2010.\nBurton made his directorial film debut with the comedy \"Pee-wee's Big Adventure\" (1985) and gained prominence for \"Beetlejuice\" (1988) and \"Edward Scissorhands\" (1990). Burton also directed the superhero films \"Batman\" (1989) and \"Batman Returns\" (1992); the animated films \"Corpse Bride\" (2005) and \"Frankenweenie\" (2012); the science fiction films \"Mars Attacks!\" (1996) and \"Planet of the Apes\" (2001); the supernatural horror film \"Sleepy Hollow\" (1999); the fantasy films \"Big Fish\" (2003), \"Alice in Wonderland\" (2010), \"Dark Shadows\" (2012) and \"Dumbo\" (2019); the musicals \"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\" (2005) and \"\" (2007); and the biographical dramas \"Ed Wood\" (1994) and \"Big Eyes\" (2014). Starting in 2022, Burton has directed several episodes for the Netflix series \"Wednesday\", for which he received a nomination for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Directing for a Comedy Series. He also directed \"Beetlejuice Beetlejuice\" (2024), the sequel to the 1988 film. Burton has frequently collaborated with composer Danny Elfman, who scored all but three of his films. He has released several books including \"The Melancholy Death of Oyster Boy &amp; Other Stories\" (1997).\nEarly life and education.\nTimothy Walter Burton was born on August 25, 1958, in Burbank, California, the son of Jean Burton (n\u00e9e Erickson), who in the 1980s was the owner of a cat-themed gift shop, and William \"Bill\" Burton, a former minor league baseball player, who worked for many years for the Burbank Parks and Recreation Department. The baseball field at Olive Recreation Center in Burbank, California is named for Bill Burton.\nAs a preteen, Burton made short films in his back yard at 2101 North Evergreen Street, using crude stop motion animation techniques or shooting on 8 mm film without sound (one of his oldest known juvenile films is \"The Island of Doctor Agor\", adapted from the H. G. Wells novel \"The Island of Doctor Moreau\", which he made when he was 13 years old). Burton attended Providencia Elementary School, Luther Burbank Middle School, and Burbank High School, but was not a particularly good student. He played on the water polo team at Burbank High. Burton was an introspective person and found pleasure in artwork, painting, drawing, and watching movies. His future work would be heavily influenced by the books of such childhood heroes as Dr. Seuss and Roald Dahl, and of the visual aesthetics of silent gothic horror films, Universal Monsters movies such as \"Frankenstein\" which he would continuously tribute throughout his career, Hammer Horror films starring Christopher Lee and the horror films of Vincent Price, both of whom would star in his films, and with the latter being paid tribute in his 1982 short film \"Vincent\". In a \"Hollywood Reporter\" article, Burton states: \"I grew up watching the Universal horror movies, Japanese monster movies, and pretty much any kind of monster movie. That was my genre.\" Burton also said that his love of Ray Harryhausen's work got him interested in stop-motion animation at a young age.\nAfter graduating from Burbank High School in 1976, Burton attended the California Institute of the Arts in Valencia, Santa Clarita, to study character animation, until 1979. As a student at CalArts, Burton made the shorts \"Stalk of the Celery Monster\" and \"King and Octopus\".\nCareer.\n1981\u20131987: Early work and breakthrough.\n\"Stalk of the Celery Monster\" attracted the attention of Walt Disney Productions, who offered Burton an animator's apprenticeship at its animation division. He worked as an animator, storyboard artist, graphic designer, art director, and concept artist on films such as \"The Fox and the Hound\" (1981), \"Tron\" (1982), and \"The Black Cauldron\" (1985). His concept art never made it into the finished films.\nWhile at Disney in 1982, Burton made his first short, \"Vincent\", a six-minute black-and-white stop motion film based on a poem written by Burton, which depicts a young boy who fantasizes that he is his hero Vincent Price, with Price himself providing narration. The film was produced by Rick Heinrichs, whom Burton had befriended while working in the concept art department at Disney. The film was shown at the Chicago Film Festival and released, alongside the teen drama \"Tex\", for two weeks in one Los Angeles cinema. This was followed by Burton's first live-action production, \"Hansel and Gretel\", a Japanese-themed adaptation of the Brothers Grimm fairy tale for the Disney Channel, which climaxes in a kung fu fight between Hansel and Gretel and the witch. Having aired once in 1983 at 10:30 P.M. on Halloween and promptly shelved, prints of the film are extremely difficult to locate, fueling rumors that the project did not exist. The short would finally go on public display in 2009 at the Museum of Modern Art, and again in 2011 as part of the Tim Burton art exhibit at LACMA. It was again shown at the Seoul Museum of Art in 2012.\nBurton's next live-action short film, \"Frankenweenie\", was released in 1984. It tells the story of a young boy who tries to revive his dog after it is run over by a car. Filmed in black-and-white, it stars Barret Oliver, Shelley Duvall (with whom he would work again in 1986, directing an episode of her television series \"Faerie Tale Theatre\"), and Daniel Stern. After \"Frankenweenie\" was completed, Disney fired Burton, under the pretext of him spending the company's resources on a film that would be too dark and scary for children to see.\nActor Paul Reubens saw \"Frankenweenie\" and chose Burton to direct the cinematic spin-off of his popular character Pee-wee Herman, stating on the audio commentary of 2000 DVD release of \"Pee-wee's Big Adventure\" that as soon as the short began, he was sold on Burton's style. Pee-wee Herman gained mainstream popularity with a successful stage show at The Groundlings and the Roxy which was later turned into an HBO special. The film, \"Pee-wee's Big Adventure\", was made on a budget of $8\u00a0million and grossed more than $40\u00a0million at the North American box office. Burton, a fan of the eccentric musical group Oingo Boingo, asked songwriter Danny Elfman to provide the music for the film. Since then, Elfman has scored every film that Tim Burton has directed, except for \"Ed Wood\", \"\", and \"Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children\".\nAdditionally, Burton directed episodes of the 1985 revival of the '50s/'60s anthology horror series \"Alfred Hitchcock Presents\" and Shelley Duvall's \"Faerie Tale Theatre\".\n1988\u20131994: \"Batman\" films and acclaim.\nBurton's next major film was \"Beetlejuice\" (1988), a supernatural comedy horror about a young couple forced to cope with life after death and the family of pretentious yuppies who invade their treasured New England home. Their teenage daughter, Lydia (Winona Ryder), has an obsession with death which allows her to see the deceased couple. Starring Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis, and featuring Michael Keaton as the title character, the film grossed $80\u00a0million on a relatively low budget and won an Academy Award for Best Makeup. It was later adapted into an animated TV series of the same name, with Burton playing a role as executive producer, that ran on ABC and later the Fox network.\nBurton's ability to produce hit films with low budgets impressed studio executives, and he received his first big-budget film, \"Batman\". The production was plagued with problems. Burton repeatedly clashed with the film's producers, Jon Peters and Peter Guber, but the most notable debacle involved casting. For the title role, Burton chose to cast Michael Keaton as Batman following their previous collaboration in \"Beetlejuice\", despite Keaton's average physique, inexperience with action films, and reputation as a comic actor. Although Burton won in the end, the furor over the casting provoked enormous fan animosity, to the extent that Warner Brothers' share price slumped. Burton had considered it ridiculous to cast a \"bulked-up\" ultra-masculine man as Batman, insisting that Batman should be an ordinary man who dressed up in an elaborate bat costume to frighten criminals. Burton originally considered Brad Dourif for The Joker, but eventually cast Jack Nicholson, in a move that helped assuage fans' fears, as well as attracting older audiences not as interested in a superhero film. When the film opened in June 1989, it was backed by the biggest marketing and merchandising campaign in film history at the time, and became one of the biggest box office hits of all time, grossing over $250\u00a0million in the U.S. and $400\u00a0million worldwide (numbers not adjusted for inflation) and earning critical acclaim for the performances of both Keaton and Nicholson, as well as the film's production aspects, which won the Academy Award for Best Art Direction. The success of the film helped establish Burton as a profitable director, and it proved to be a huge influence on future superhero films, which eschewed the bright, all-American heroism of Richard Donner's \"Superman\" for a grittier, more realistic look and characters with more psychological depth. It also served as a major inspiration for the acclaimed TV series \".\nBurton claimed that the graphic novel \" was a major influence on his film adaptation of \"Batman\":\nI was never a giant comic book fan, but I've always loved the image of Batman and the Joker. The reason I've never been a comic book fan\u00a0\u2013 and I think it started when I was a child\u00a0\u2013 is because I could never tell which box I was supposed to read. I don't know if it was dyslexia or whatever, but that's why I loved \"The Killing Joke\", because, for the first time, I could tell which one to read. It's my favorite. It's the first comic I've ever loved. And the success of those graphic novels made our ideas more acceptable.\nIn 1990, Burton created a unique drawing which gave screenwriter Caroline Thompson inspiration to write the script for \"Edward Scissorhands\" which Burton directed, re-uniting with Winona Ryder from \"Beetlejuice\". His friend Johnny Depp, a teen idol at the end of the 1980s due primarily to his work on the hit TV series \"21 Jump Street\", was cast in the title role of Edward, who was the creation of an eccentric and old-fashioned inventor (played by Vincent Price in one of his last screen appearances). Edward looked human, but was left with scissors in the place of hands due to the untimely death of his creator. Set in suburbia (and shot in Land o' Lakes, Florida), the film is largely seen as Burton's autobiography of his childhood in Burbank. Burton's idea for the character of Edward Scissorhands came from a drawing he created in high school. Depp wrote a similar comment in the foreword to Mark Salisbury's book, \"Burton on Burton\", regarding his first meeting with Burton over the casting of the film. \"Edward Scissorhands\" is considered one of Burton's best movies by some critics. Burton has stated that this is his most personal and meaningful film because it is a representation of him not being able to communicate effectively with others as a teenager.\nAfter the success of \"Batman\", Burton agreed to direct the sequel for Warner Bros. on the condition that he would be granted total control. The result was \"Batman Returns\", which featured Michael Keaton returning as Batman, and a new triad of villains: Danny DeVito (as the Penguin), Michelle Pfeiffer (as Catwoman) and Christopher Walken (as Max Shreck, an evil corporate tycoon and original character created for the film). Somewhat darker and considerably more personal than its predecessor, concerns were raised that the film might be too scary for children. Audiences were more uncomfortable at the film's overt sexuality, personified by the sleek, fetish-inspired styling of Catwoman's costume. Burton made many changes to the Penguin which would subsequently be applied to the character in both comics and television. In the comics, the penguin was an ordinary man; Burton transformed him into a freak of nature resembling a penguin with webbed, flipper-like fingers, a hooked, beak-like nose and a short, rotund body. Burton also chose the artist who recorded the single for the movie soundtrack; he insisted that it be the band Siouxsie and the Banshees with the song \"Face to Face\". Released in 1992, \"Batman Returns\" grossed $282.8\u00a0million worldwide, making it a financial success, though not to the extent of its predecessor.\nDue to schedule constraints on \"Batman Returns\", Burton produced, but did not direct, \"The Nightmare Before Christmas\" (1993) for Disney, originally meant to be a children's book in rhyme. The film was directed by Henry Selick and written by Caroline Thompson, based on Burton's original story, world, and characters. The film received positive reviews for the stop motion animation, musical score, and original storyline. It was a modest box office success, grossing $50\u00a0million. Because of the nature of the film, it was not produced under Disney's name, but rather Disney-owned Touchstone Pictures. Disney wanted the protagonist to have eyes, but the final iteration did not. Over 100 people worked on this motion picture just to create the characters, and it took three years of work to produce the film. Burton collaborated with Selick again for \"James and the Giant Peach\" (1996), which Burton co-produced.\nIn 1994, Burton and frequent co-producer Denise Di Novi produced the 1994 fantasy-comedy \"Cabin Boy\", starring comedian Chris Elliott and directed/written by Adam Resnick. Burton was originally supposed to direct the film after seeing Elliott perform on \"Get a Life\", but he handed the directing responsibility to Resnick once he was offered \"Ed Wood\". Burton's next film, \"Ed Wood\" (1994), was of a much smaller scale, depicting the life of the infamous director Ed Wood. Starring Johnny Depp in the title role, the film is an homage to the low-budget science fiction and horror films of Burton's childhood and handles its comical protagonist and his motley band of collaborators with surprising fondness and sensitivity. Owing to creative squabbles during the making of \"The Nightmare Before Christmas\", Danny Elfman declined to score \"Ed Wood\", and the assignment went to Howard Shore. While a commercial failure at the time of its release, \"Ed Wood\" became a cult classic and was well received by critics. Martin Landau received the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his portrayal of Bela Lugosi, and the film received the Academy Award for Best Makeup.\nWarner Bros. was not interested in Tim Burton's return as director for a third Batman installment after considering \"Batman Returns\" too dark and unsafe for children. Burton noted he was unsure about returning to direct, writing: \"I don't think Warner Bros. wanted me to direct a third \"Batman\". I even said that to them.\" Burton and Warner Bros. mutually agreed to part ways. To attract the young audience, it was decided that Joel Schumacher would direct the third film, whilst Burton would only produce it in conjunction with Peter MacGregor-Scott, in which Burton was given top-billing producer credit, without being able to contribute ideas; only approving director and screenplayers. Following this change and the changes made by the new director, Michael Keaton resigned from the lead role and was replaced by Val Kilmer. Filming for \"Batman Forever\" began in late 1994 with new actors: Tommy Lee Jones as Harvey Dent/Two-Face, Nicole Kidman as Dr. Chase Meridian, Chris O'Donnell as Dick Grayson/Robin and Jim Carrey as Edward Nygma/The Riddler; the only two actors who returned after \"Batman Returns\" were Pat Hingle as Commissioner Gordon and Michael Gough as Alfred Pennyworth. The film, a combination of the darkness that characterized the saga and colors and neon signs proposed by Schumacher, was a huge box office success, earning $336\u00a0million. Warner Bros. demanded that Schumacher delete some scenes so the film did not have the same tone as its predecessor, \"Batman Returns\" (later they were added as deleted scenes on the 2005 DVD release).\n1995\u20132010: Established director.\nIn 1996, Burton and Selick reunited for the musical fantasy \"James and the Giant Peach\", based on the book by Roald Dahl. Burton, once again, served only as a producer due to his contributions to making \"Mars Attacks!\" (1996). The film, a combination of live action and stop motion footage, starred Richard Dreyfuss, Susan Sarandon, David Thewlis, Simon Callow and Jane Leeves among others, with Selick's animation direction. While a box office disappointment for Disney, the film was received well by critics for its story and visual aspects and was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Original Musical or Comedy Score (by Randy Newman).\nElfman and Burton reunited for \"Mars Attacks!\". Based on a popular science-fiction trading card series, the film was a hybrid of 1950s science fiction and 1970s all-star disaster films. The coincidence made it an inadvertent spoof of the blockbuster \"Independence Day\", which had been released five months earlier. The film boasted an all-star cast, including Jack Nicholson, Glenn Close, Annette Bening, Danny DeVito, Pierce Brosnan, Michael J. Fox, Sarah Jessica Parker, Natalie Portman, Lukas Haas, Martin Short, Rod Steiger, Christina Applegate, and Jack Black.\n\"Sleepy Hollow\", released in late 1999, had a supernatural setting and starred Johnny Depp as Ichabod Crane, a detective with an interest in forensic science rather than the schoolteacher of Washington Irving's original tale. With \"Sleepy Hollow\", Burton paid homage to the horror films of the English company Hammer Films. Christopher Lee, one of Hammer's stars, was given a cameo role. A host of Burton regulars appeared in supporting roles (Michael Gough, Jeffrey Jones, and Christopher Walken, among others), and Christina Ricci was cast as Katrina van Tassel. A well-regarded supporting cast was headed by Miranda Richardson, Michael Gambon, Richard Griffiths and Ian McDiarmid. Mostly well received by critics, and with a special mention to Elfman's gothic score, the film has grossed $207 million worldwide and won an Academy Award for Best Art Direction, as well as two BAFTAs for Best Costume Design and Best Production Design. A box office success, \"Sleepy Hollow\" was also a turning point for Burton. Along with the change in his personal life (separation from actress Lisa Marie), Burton changed radically in style for his next project, leaving the haunted forests and colorful outcasts behind to go on to directing \"Planet of the Apes\" which, as Burton had repeatedly noted, was \"not a remake\" of the earlier film.\n\"Planet of the Apes\" was a commercial success, grossing $68\u00a0million in its opening weekend and eventually it earned $180 million in North America and $362 million worldwide. The film however has received mixed reviews and is widely considered inferior to the first adaptation of the novel. In 2003, Burton directed \"Big Fish\", based on the novel \"\" by Daniel Wallace. The film is about a father telling the story of his life to his son using exaggeration and color. Starring Ewan McGregor as young Edward Bloom and Albert Finney as an older Edward Bloom, the film also stars Jessica Lange, Billy Crudup, Danny DeVito, Alison Lohman and Marion Cotillard. \"Big Fish\" received four Golden Globe nominations as well as an Academy Award nomination for Elfman's score. The film was also the second collaboration between Burton and Helena Bonham Carter, who played the characters of Jenny and the Witch, and Burton and Danny DeVito, who played Amos Calloway the circus ringleader.\nReleased in 2005, \"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\" is an adaptation of the book of the same name by Roald Dahl. Starring Johnny Depp as Willy Wonka, Freddie Highmore as Charlie Bucket, and Deep Roy as the Oompa-Loompas, the film generally took a more faithful approach to the source material than the 1971 adaptation, \"Willy Wonka &amp; the Chocolate Factory\", although some liberties were taken, such as adding Wonka's issue with his father (played by Christopher Lee). \"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\" was later nominated for the Academy Award for Best Costume Design. The film made over $207\u00a0million domestically. Filming proved difficult as Burton, Depp, and Danny Elfman had to work on this and Burton's \"Corpse Bride\" (2005) at the same time, which was Burton's first full-length stop motion film as a director, featuring the voices of Johnny Depp as Victor and Helena Bonham Carter as Emily.\nBurton directed his first music video, \"Bones\", in 2006. \"Bones\" is the sixth overall single by American indie rock band The Killers and the second released from their second studio album, \"Sam's Town\". Starring in this video were actors Michael Steger and Devon Aoki. Burton went on to direct a second music video for The Killers, \"Here with Me\", starring Winona Ryder, released in 2012.\nThe DreamWorks/Warner Bros. production \"\", based on , was released on December 21, 2007, to critical acclaim and grossed $153 million worldwide. Burton's work on \"Sweeney Todd\" won the National Board of Review Award for Best Director, received a Golden Globe nomination for Best Director, and won an Academy Award for Best Art Direction. The film blends explicit gore and Broadway tunes and was well received by critics. Johnny Depp's performance as Sweeney Todd was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor.\nIn 2005, filmmaker Shane Acker released his short film \"9\", a story about a sentient rag doll living in a post-apocalyptic world who tries to stop machines from destroying the rest of his eight fellow rag dolls. The film won numerous awards and was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film. After seeing the short film, Tim Burton and Timur Bekmambetov, director of \"Wanted\", showed interest in producing a feature-length adaptation of the film. Directed by Acker, the full-length film was produced by Burton, written by Acker (story) and Pamela Pettler (screenplay, co-writer of \"Corpse Bride\"), and featured the voice work of Elijah Wood, John C. Reilly, Jennifer Connelly, Christopher Plummer, Martin Landau, and Crispin Glover, among others.\nBurton appeared at the 2009 Comic-Con in San Diego, California, to promote both \"9\" and \"Alice in Wonderland\"; the latter won two Academy Awards, for Best Art Direction and Best Costume Design. In Burton's version of \"Alice in Wonderland\", the story is set 13 years after the original Lewis Carroll tales. Mia Wasikowska was cast as Alice. The original start date for filming was May 2008. Torpoint and Plymouth were the locations used for filming from September 1\u00a0\u2013 October 14, and the film remains set in the Victorian era. During this time, filming took place in Antony House in Torpoint. 250 local extras were chosen in early August. Other production work took place in London. The film was originally to be released in 2009, but was pushed to March 5, 2010. The film starred Johnny Depp as the Mad Hatter; Matt Lucas as both Tweedledee and Tweedledum; Helena Bonham Carter as the Red Queen; Stephen Fry as the Cheshire Cat; Anne Hathaway as the White Queen; Alan Rickman as Absolem the Caterpillar; Michael Sheen as McTwisp the White Rabbit; and Crispin Glover as the Knave of Hearts, with his face and voice added onto a CGI body. Despite receiving mixed reviews from critics, the film was a commercial success, grossing $1 billion worldwide, making it the highest-grossing film of Burton's career. Burton produced the film's sequel, \"Alice Through the Looking Glass\" (2016), which was directed by James Bobin.\n2011\u20132021: Career fluctuations.\nBurton began filming \"Dark Shadows\", a feature film adaptation of the 1960s television series of the same name, in May 2011. In addition to starring Burton regulars Depp and Bonham Carter, the film saw Burton reunite with \"Batman Returns\" star Michelle Pfeiffer, while Burton once again collaborated with composer Danny Elfman, production designer Rick Heinrichs, and costume designer Colleen Atwood. The film was released on May 11, 2012, and grossed $245 million worldwide from a $150 million budget. Burton also co-produced \"\" with Timur Bekmambetov, who also served as director (they previously worked together in \"9\"). The film, released on June 22, 2012, was based on the novel by screenwriter and novelist Seth Grahame-Smith, who wrote the film's screenplay and also authored \"Pride and Prejudice and Zombies\". The film starred Benjamin Walker as Abraham Lincoln, Anthony Mackie as William H. Johnson, Joseph Mawle as Lincoln's father Thomas, Robin McLeavy as Lincoln's mother, Nancy, and Mary Elizabeth Winstead as Lincoln's love interest (and later wife), Mary Ann Todd. The film received mixed reviews and performed poorly at the box office. He then remade his 1984 short film \"Frankenweenie\" as a feature-length stop motion film, distributed by Walt Disney Pictures. Burton has said, \"The film is based on a memory that I had when I was growing up and with my relationship with a dog that I had.\" The film was released on October 5, 2012, and met with positive reviews.\nBurton directed the 2014 biographical drama film \"Big Eyes\" about American artist Margaret Keane (Amy Adams), whose work was fraudulently claimed in the 1950s and 1960s by her then-husband, Walter Keane (Christoph Waltz), and their heated divorce trial after Margaret accused Walter of stealing credit for her paintings. The script was written by the screenwriters behind Burton's \"Ed Wood\", Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski. Filming began in Vancouver, British Columbia, in mid-2013. The film was distributed by The Weinstein Company and released in U.S. theaters on December 25, 2014. It received generally positive reviews from critics.\nBurton entered talks to direct a film adaptation of the fantasy novel \"Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children\", written by Ransom Riggs, in November 2011. The film, starring Asa Butterfield, Eva Green, and Samuel L. Jackson, was released in theatres by 20th Century Fox on September 30, 2016. Burton also directed a live-action adaptation of the Disney animated film \"Dumbo\", released on March 29, 2019, with Colin Farrell, Danny DeVito, Eva Green, and Michael Keaton starring. The film grossed $353 million worldwide against a $170 million budget and combined production and advertising costs of $300 million, ultimately losing money.\n2022\u2013present: \"Wednesday\" and resurgence.\nIn February 2021, it was announced that Burton would be directing and producing \"Wednesday\", a series for Netflix based on the titular character from The Addams Family starring Jenna Ortega and Christina Ricci. This marked Burton's first foray into directing television since the 1980s. He helmed four episodes in the first season, which began production in September 2021 for a November 2022 release. The show was released to critical acclaim, and was renewed for a second season in January 2023, which premiered in August 2025.\nIn October 2022, Burton announced that he would probably never work with The Walt Disney Company again after \"Dumbo\", due to his distinctive style and working approach not matching with what Disney is currently looking for, with its focus on Pixar, Marvel and Lucasfilm. He stated that \"It's gotten to be very homogenized, very consolidated. There's less room for different types of things\".\nIn July 2012, It was announced that Burton was working with Seth Grahame-Smith on \"Beetlejuice Beetlejuice\", a project he had been considering making since 1990. Actor Michael Keaton also expressed interest in reprising his role as the title character along with Winona Ryder as Lydia Deetz. In October 2017, \"Deadline Hollywood\" reported that Mike Vukadinovich was hired to write a script in time for the film's 30th anniversary. In April 2019, Warner Bros. stated the sequel had been shelved. In February 2022, however, the sequel was announced again, with Brad Pitt's Plan B Entertainment producing alongside Warner Bros. Though Burton initially said that he was not involved, he later backtracked, and the sequel officially started shooting in London on May 10, 2023, with a release date of September 6, 2024, with Burton returning as director, Keaton, Ryder and Catherine O'Hara reprising their roles, and Ortega, Monica Bellucci and Justin Theroux joining the cast.\nUnreleased projects.\nAfter Kevin Smith had been hired to write a new \"Superman\" film, he suggested Burton to direct. Burton came on and Warner Bros. set a theatrical release date for the summer of 1998, the 60th anniversary of the character's debut in \"Action Comics\". Nicolas Cage was signed on to play Superman, Burton hired Wesley Strick to rewrite Smith's script, and the film entered pre-production in June 1997. For budgetary reasons, Warner Bros. ordered another rewrite from Dan Gilroy, delayed the film, and ultimately put it on hold in April 1998. Burton then left to direct \"Sleepy Hollow\". Burton has depicted the experience as a difficult one, citing differences with producer Jon Peters and the studio, stating, \"I basically wasted a year. A year is a long time to be working with somebody that you don't really want to be working with.\"\nIn 2002, The Walt Disney Company began to consider producing a sequel to \"The Nightmare Before Christmas\", but rather than using stop motion, Disney wanted to use computer animation. Burton convinced Disney to drop the idea. \"I was always very protective of ['Nightmare'], not to do sequels or things of that kind,\" Burton explained. \"You know, 'Jack visits Thanksgiving world' or other kinds of things, just because I felt the movie had a purity to it and the people that like it... Because it's a mass-market kind of thing, it was important to kind of keep that purity of it.\" Regardless, in 2009, Henry Selick stated that he could make a sequel to \"Nightmare\" if he and Burton could create a good story for it.\nIn 2012, Shane Acker confirmed that Burton would work with Valve to create his next animated feature film, \"Deep\". Like \"9\", the film would take place in a post-apocalyptic world (although set in a different universe). \"Deep\" would be another darker animated film, as Shane Acker has expressed his interest in creating more PG-13 animated films. Since then, there have been no further mentions of \"Deep\", with Acker focusing on another project announced in 2013 (\"Beasts of Burden\").\nBurton was briefly attached to direct \"Maleficent\" for Walt Disney Pictures in 2011, but chose to pursue \"Dark Shadows\" and \"Frankenweenie\" instead.\nIt was reported that Burton would direct a 3D stop motion animation adaptation of \"The Addams Family\", which was confirmed by Christopher Meledandri, but the project was scrapped on July 17, 2013. On July 19, 2010, Burton was announced as the director of the upcoming film adaptation of \"Monsterpocalypse\".\nIn 2011, it was reported that Burton was working on a live-action adaptation of \"The Hunchback of Notre-Dame\" starring Josh Brolin, who would also be co-producing. The project did not move forward.\nPersonal life.\nBurton was married to Lena Gieseke, a German-born artist. Their marriage ended in 1991 after four years. He went on to live with model and actress Lisa Marie; she acted in the films he made during their relationship from 1992 to 2001, most notably in \"Sleepy Hollow\", \"Ed Wood\", and \"Mars Attacks!\". Burton developed a romantic relationship with English actress Helena Bonham Carter, whom he met while filming \"Planet of the Apes\". Lisa Marie responded in 2005 by holding an auction of personal belongings that Burton had left behind, much to his dismay.\nBurton and Bonham Carter have two children: a son, born in 2003 and a daughter born in 2007. Bonham Carter's representative said in December 2014 that she and Burton had broken up amicably earlier that year. It is unclear whether or not they were married; Bonham Carter has used the word divorce when discussing the end of their relationship while other news outlets state that they never married. \"The Independent\" reported in September 2023 that Burton and Bonham Carter had indeed been married for years before their separation.\nOn March 15, 2010, Burton received the insignia of Chevalier of Arts and Letters from then-Minister of Culture Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Mitterrand. The same year, Burton was the president of the jury for the 63rd Cannes Film Festival, held from May 12 to 24 in Cannes, France.\nBurton's relationship with Italian actress and model Monica Bellucci was reported in February 2023. They met in October 2022 at the Lyon's Lumi\u00e8re Film Festival. Bellucci first spoke publicly about their relationship in June 2023. Their relationship ended in September 2025.\nExhibitions and books.\nFrom November 22, 2009, to April 26, 2010, Burton had a retrospective at the MoMA in New York with over 700 \"drawings, paintings, photographs, storyboards, moving-image works, puppets, maquettes, costumes and cinematic ephemera\", including many from the filmmaker's personal collection. From MoMA, the \"Tim Burton\" exhibition traveled directly to Australian Centre for the Moving Image in Melbourne. Running from June 24 to October 10, 2010, the ACMI exhibition incorporated additional material from Burton's \"Alice in Wonderland\", which was released in March 2010.\n\"The Art of Tim Burton\" was exhibited at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art from May 29 to October 31, 2011, in the Museum's Resnick Pavilion. LACMA also featured six films of Tim Burton's idol, Vincent Price. \"Tim Burton, the exhibition/Tim Burton, l'exposition\" was exhibited at the Cin\u00e9math\u00e8que Fran\u00e7aise from March 7 to August 5, 2012, in Paris, France. All of Tim Burton's movies were shown during the exhibition.\n\"Tim Burton at Seoul Museum of Art\" was exhibited as a promotion of Hyundai Card at Seoul Museum of Art from December 12, 2012, to April 15, 2013, in Seoul, South Korea. This exhibition featured 862 of Burton's works including drawings, paintings, short films, sculptures, music, and costumes that have been used in the making of his feature-length movies. The exhibition was divided into three parts: the first part, \"Surviving Burbank\", covered his younger years, from 1958 to 1976. The second, \"Beautifying Burbank\", covers 1977 to 1984, including his time with CalArts and Walt Disney. The last segment, \"Beyond Burbank\", covers 1985 onward.\n\"Tim Burton and His World\" was exhibited at the Stone Bell House from March 3 to August 8, 2014, in Prague, Czech Republic. The exhibition later premiered at the Museu da Imagem e do Som in S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil, on February 4, 2016, and lasted until June 5. The exhibition was later held in Artis Tree in Taikoo Place, Hong Kong, from November 5, 2016, to January 23, 2017. The exhibition returned to Brazil from May 28 to August 11, 2019, being held at the Centro Cultural Banco do Brasil in Bras\u00edlia.\nBurton's first exhibition in the United States in nearly a decade, \"\", opened in October 2019 at The Neon Museum in Las Vegas.\nBurton also wrote and illustrated the poetry book \"The Melancholy Death of Oyster Boy &amp; Other Stories\", published in 1997 by British publishing house Faber and Faber, and a compilation of his drawings, sketches, and other artwork, entitled \"The Art of Tim Burton\", was released in 2009. A follow-up to that book, entitled \"The Napkin Art of Tim Burton: Things You Think About in a Bar\", containing sketches made by Burton on napkins at bars and restaurants he visited, was released in 2015.\nAwards and nominations for Burton films.\nDirected Academy Award performancesUnder Burton's direction, these actors have received Academy Award nominations and wins for their performances in their respective roles.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "31502", "revid": "2360147", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31502", "title": "Tod Browning", "text": "American film director (1880\u20131962)\nTod Browning (born Charles Albert Browning Jr.; July 12, 1880 \u2013 October 6, 1962) was an American film director, film actor, screenwriter, vaudeville performer, and carnival sideshow and circus entertainer. He directed a number of films of various genres between 1915 and 1939, but was primarily known for horror films. Browning was often cited in the trade press as \"the Edgar Allan Poe of cinema.\"\nBrowning's career spanned the silent and sound film eras. He is known as the director of \"Dracula\" (1931), \"Freaks\" (1932), and his silent film collaborations with Lon Chaney and Priscilla Dean.\nEarly life.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n\"A non-conformist within his family, the alternative society of the circus shaped his disdain for normal mainstream society... circus life, for Browning, represented a flight from conventional lifestyles and responsibilities, which later manifested itself in a love of liquor, gambling and fast cars.\" \u2014 Film historian Jon Towlson in \"Diabolique Magazine\", November 27, 2017\nCharles Albert Browning, Jr., was born in Louisville, Kentucky on July 12, 1880, the second son of Charles Albert and Lydia Browning. Charles Albert Sr., \"a bricklayer, carpenter and machinist,\" provided his family with a middle-class and Baptist household. Browning's uncle, the baseball star Pete \"Louisville Slugger\" Browning saw his sobriquet conferred on the iconic baseball bat. Like his uncle, Browning was alcoholic from a young age.\nCircus, sideshow and vaudeville.\nBrowning was fascinated by circus and carnival life as a child. At the age of 16, and before finishing high school, he ran away from his well-to-do family to join a traveling circus.\nInitially hired as a roustabout, he soon began serving as a \"spieler\" (a barker at sideshows) and by 1901 was performing song and dance routines for Ohio and Mississippi riverboat entertainment, as well as acting as a contortionist for the Manhattan Fair and Carnival Company. Browning developed a live burial act in which he was billed as \"The Living Hypnotic Corpse\", and performed as a clown with the Ringling Brothers circus. He would later draw on these early experiences to inform his cinematic inventions.\nIn 1906, Browning was briefly married to Amy Louis Stevens in Louisville. Adopting the professional name \"Tod\" Browning (\"tod\" is the German word for death), Browning abandoned his wife and became a vaudevillian, touring extensively as both a magician's assistant and a blackface comedian in an act called \"The Lizard and the Coon\" with comedian Roy C. Jones. He appeared in a Mutt and Jeff sketch in the 1912 burlesque revue \"The World of Mirth\" with comedian Charles Murray.\nFilm actor: 1909\u20131913.\nIn 1909, after 13 years performing in carnivals and vaudeville circuits, Browning, age 29, transitioned to film acting. Browning's work as a comedic film actor began in 1909 when he performed with director and screenwriter Edward Dillon in film shorts. In all, Browning was cast in over 50 of these one- or two-reeler slapstick productions.\nFilm historian Boris Henry observed that \"Browning's experience as a slapstick actor [became] incorporated into his career as a filmmaker.\" Dillon later provided many of the screenplays for the early films that Browning would direct. A number of actors that Browning performed with in his early acting career would later appear in his own pictures, many of whom served their apprenticeships with Keystone Cops director Mack Sennett, among them Wallace Beery, Ford Sterling, Polly Moran, Wheeler Oakman, Raymond Griffith, Kalla Pasha, Mae Busch, Wallace MacDonald and Laura La Varnie.\nIn 1913, Browning was hired by film director D. W. Griffith at Biograph Studios in New York City, first appearing as an undertaker in \"Scenting a Terrible Crime\" (1913). Both Griffith and Browning departed Biograph and New York that same year and together joined Reliance-Majestic Studios in Hollywood, California. Browning was featured in several Reliance-Majestic films, including \"The Wild Girl\" (1917).\nEarly film directing and screenwriting: 1914\u20131916.\nFilm historian Vivian Sobchack noted that \"a number of one- or two-reelers are attributed to Browning from 1914 to 1916\" and biographer Michael Barson credits Browning's directorial debut to the one-reeler drama \"The Lucky Transfer\", released in March 1915.\nBrowning's career almost ended when, intoxicated, he drove his vehicle into a railroad crossing and collided with a locomotive. Browning suffered grievous injuries, as did passenger George Siegmann. A second passenger, actor Elmer Booth, was killed instantly. Film historian Jon Towlson notes that \"alcoholism was to contribute to a major trauma in Browning's personal life that would shape his thematic obsessions...After 1915, Browning began to direct his traumatic experience into his work \u2013 radically reshaping it in the process.\" According to biographers David J. Skal and Elias Savada, the tragic event transformed Browning's creative outlook:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;A distinct pattern had appeared in his post-accident body of work, distinguishing it from the comedy that had been his specialty before 1915. Now his focus was moralistic melodrama, with recurrent themes of crime, culpability and retribution.\nIndeed, the thirty-one films that Browning wrote and directed between 1920 and 1939 were, with few exceptions, melodramas.\nBrowning's injuries likely precluded a further career as an actor. During his protracted convalescence, Browning turned to writing screenplays for Reliance-Majestic. Upon his recovery, Browning joined Griffith's film crew on the set of \"Intolerance\" (1916) as an assistant director and appeared in a bit part for the production's \"modern story\" sequence.\nDirector: early silent feature films, 1917\u20131919.\nIn 1917, Browning wrote and directed his first full-length feature film, \"Jim Bludso\", for Fine Arts/ Triangle film companies, starring Wilfred Lucas in the title role. The story is based on a poem by John Hay, a former personal secretary to Abraham Lincoln during the American Civil War.\nBrowning married his second wife Alice Watson in 1917; they would remain together until her death in 1944.\nReturning to New York in 1917, Browning directed pictures for Metro Pictures. There he made \"Peggy, the Will O' the Wisp\" and \"The Jury of Fate\". Both starred Mabel Taliaferro, the latter in a dual role achieved with double exposure techniques that were groundbreaking for the time. Film historian Vivian Sobchack notes that many of these films \"involved the disguise and impersonations found in later Browning films.\" (See Filmography below.) Browning returned to Hollywood in 1918 and produced three more films for Metro, each of which starred Edith Storey: \"The Eyes of Mystery\", \"The Legion of Death\" and \"Revenge\", all filmed and released in 1918. These early and profitable five-, six- and seven-reel features Browning made between 1917\u20131919 established him as \"a successful director and script writer.\"\nIn the spring of 1918 Browning departed Metro and signed with Bluebird Photoplays studios (a subsidiary of Carl Laemmle's Universal Pictures), then in 1919 with Universal where he would direct a series of \"extremely successful\" films starring Priscilla Dean.\nUniversal Studios: 1919\u20131923.\nDuring his tenure at Universal, Browning directed a number of the studio's top female actors, among them Edith Roberts in \"The Deciding Kiss\" and \"Set Free\" (both 1918) and Mary MacLaren in \"The Unpainted Woman\", \"A Petal on the Current\" and \"Bonnie, Bonnie Lassie\", all 1919 productions. Browning's most notable films for Universal, however, starred Priscilla Dean, \"Universal's leading lady known for playing 'tough girls'\" and with whom he would direct nine features.\nThe Priscilla Dean films.\nBrowning's first successful Dean picture\u2014a \"spectacular melodrama\"\u2014is \"The Virgin of Stamboul\" (1920). Dean portrays Sari, a \"virgin beggar girl\" who is desired by the Turkish chieftain Achmet Hamid (Wallace Beery). Browning's handling of the former slapstick comedian Beery as Achmet reveals the actor's comedic legacy and Browning's own roots in burlesque. Film historian Stuart Rosenthal wrote that the Dean vehicles possess \"the seemingly authentic atmosphere with which Browning instilled his crime melodramas, adding immeasurably to later efforts like \"The Black Bird\" (1926), \"The Show\" (1927) and \"The Unholy Three\" (1925).\"\nThe Dean films exhibit Browning's fascination with 'exotic' foreign settings and with underworld criminal activities, which serve to drive the action of his films. Dean is cast as a thieving demimonde who infiltrates high society to burgle jewelry in \"The Exquisite Thief\" (1919); in \"Under Two Flags\" (1922), set in colonial French Algiers, Dean is cast as a French-Arab member of a harem\u2014her sobriquet is \"Cigarette\u2014servicing the French Foreign Legion; and in \"Drifting\" (1923), with its \"compelling\" Shanghai, China scenes recreated on the Universal backlot, Dean plays an opium dealer. In Browning's final Dean vehicle at Universal, \"White Tiger\", he indulged his fascination with \"quasi-theatrical\" productions of illusion\u2014and revealed to movie audiences the mechanisms of these deceptions. In doing so, Browning\u2014a former member of the fraternity of magicians\u2014violated a precept of their professional code.\nPerhaps the most fortuitous outcome of the Dean films at Universal is that they introduced Browning to future collaborator Lon Chaney, the actor who would star in Browning's most outstanding films of the silent era. Chaney had already earned the sobriquet \"The Man of a Thousand Faces\" as early as 1919 for his work at Universal. Universal's vice-president Irving Thalberg paired Browning with Chaney for the first time in \"The Wicked Darling\" (1919), a melodrama in which Chaney played the thief \"Stoop\" Conners who forces a poor girl (Dean) from the slums into a life of crime and prostitution.\nIn 1921, Browning and Thalberg enlisted Chaney in another Dean vehicle, \"Outside the Law\", in which he plays the dual roles of the sinister \"Black Mike\" Sylva and the benevolent Ah Wing. Both of these Universal production exhibit Browning's \"natural affinity for the melodramatic and grotesque.\" In a special effect that drew critical attention, Chaney appears to murder his own dual character counterpart through trick photography and \"with Thalberg supporting their imaginative freedom, Chaney's ability and unique presence fanned the flames of Browning's passion for the extraordinary.\" Biographer Stuart Rosenthal remarks upon the foundations of the Browning-Chaney professional synergy:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;In the screen personality of Lon Chaney, Tod Browning found the perfect embodiment of the type of character that interested him... Chaney's unconditional dedication to his acting gave his characters the extraordinary intensity that was absolutely essential to the credibility of Browning's creations.\nWhen Thalberg resigned as vice-president at Universal to serve as production manager with the newly amalgamated Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) in 1925, Browning and Chaney accompanied him.\nThe Browning-Chaney collaborations at MGM: 1925\u20131929.\nAfter moving to MGM in 1925 under the auspices of production manager Irving Thalberg, Browning and Chaney made eight critically and commercially successful feature films, representing the zenith of both their silent film careers. Browning wrote or co-wrote the stories for six of the eight productions. Screenwriter Waldemar Young, credited on nine of the MGM pictures, worked effectively with Browning. At MGM, Browning would reach his artistic maturity as a filmmaker.\nThe first of these MGM productions established Browning as a talented filmmaker in Hollywood, and deepened Chaney's professional and personal influence on the director: \"The Unholy Three\".\n\"The Unholy Three\" (1925).\nIn a circus tale by author Tod Robbins\u2014a setting familiar to Browning\u2014a trio of criminal ex-carnies and a pickpocket form a jewelry theft ring. Their activities lead to a murder and an attempt to frame an innocent bookkeeper. Two of the criminal quartet reveal their humanity and are redeemed; two perish through violent justice.\n\"The Unholy Three\" is an outstanding example of Browning's delight in the \"bizarre\" (though, here, not macabre) melodrama and \"the perverse characterizations\" that Browning and Chaney devised anticipated their subsequent collaborations.\nLon Chaney doubles as Professor Echo, a sideshow ventriloquist, and as Mrs. \"Granny\" O'Grady (a cross-dressing Echo), the mastermind of the gang. Granny/Echo operates a talking parrot pet shop as a front for the operation. Film critic Alfred Eaker notes that Chaney renders \"the drag persona with depth of feeling. Chaney never camps it up and delivers a remarkable, multifaceted performance.\"\nHarry Earles, a member of The Doll Family midget performers plays the violent and wicked Tweedledee who poses as Granny's infant grandchild, Little Willie. (Granny conveys the diminutive Willie in a perambulator.)\nVictor McLagen is cast as weak-minded Hercules, the circus strongman who constantly seeks to assert his physical primacy over his cohorts. Hercules detests Granny/Echo, but is terrified by the ventriloquist's \"pet\" gorilla. He doubles as Granny O'Grady's son-in-law and father to Little Willie.\nThe pickpocket Rosie, played by Mae Busch, is the object of Echo's affection, and they share a mutual admiration as fellow larcenists. She postures as the daughter to Granny/Echo and as the mother of Little Willie.\nThe pet shop employs the diffident bookkeeper, Hector \"The Boob\" MacDonald (Matt Moore) who is wholly ignorant of the criminal proceedings. Rosie finds this \"weak, gentle, upright, hardworking\" man attractive.\nWhen Granny O'Malley assembles her faux-\"family\" in her parlor to deceive police investigators, the movie audience knows that \"the grandmother is the head of a gang and a ventriloquist, the father a stupid Hercules, the mother a thief, the baby a libidinous, greedy [midget], and the pet...an enormous gorilla.\" Browning's portrait is a \"sarcastic distortion\" that subverts a cliched American wholesomeness and serves to deliver \"a harsh indictment...of the bourgeois family.\"\nFilm historian Stuart Rosenthal identifies \"the ability to control another being\" as a central theme in \"The Unholy Three\". The deceptive scheme through which the thieves manipulate wealthy clients, demonstrates a control over \"the suckers\" who are stripped of their wealth, much as circus sideshow patrons are deceived: Professor Echo and his ventriloquist's dummy distract a \"hopelessly naive and novelty-loving\" audience as pickpocket Rosie relieves them of their wallets. Browning ultimately turns the application of \"mental control\" to serve justice. When bookkeeper Hector takes the stand in court, testifying in his defense against a false charge of murder, the reformed Echo applies his willpower to silence the defendant, and uses his voice throwing power to provide the exonerating testimony. When Hector descends from the stand, he tells his attorney \"That wasn't me talking. I didn't say a word.\" Browning employs a set of dissolves to make the ventriloquists role perfectly clear.\nFilm historian Robin Blyn comments on the significance of Echo's courtroom confession:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Professor Echo's [moral] conversion represents one of the final judgement on the conversion of the cinema of sound attractions to a sound-based narrative cinema disciplined to the demands of realism. Echo's decision to interrupt the proceedings and confess, rather than 'throwing voices' at the judge or the jury, conveys the extent to which the realist mode had become the reigning aesthetic law. Moreover, in refusing his illusionist gift, Echo relinquishes ventriloquism as an outmoded and ineffective art...\nWith \"The Unholy Three,\" Browning provided MGM with a huge box-office and critical success.\n\"The Mystic\" (1925).\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nAlthough fascinated by the grotesque, the deformed and the perverse, Browning (a former magician) was a debunker of the occult and the supernatural...Indeed, Browning is more interested in tricks and illusions than the supernatural. \u2014 Film historian Vivian Sobchack in \"The Films of Tod Browning\" (2006)\nWhile Lon Chaney was making \"The Tower of Lies\" (1925) with director Victor Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m Browning wrote and directed an Aileen Pringle vehicle, \"The Mystic\". The picture has many of the elements typical of Browning oeuvre at MGM: Carnivals, Hungarian Gypsies and s\u00e9ances provide the exotic \"mise-en-scene\", while the melodramatic plot involves embezzlement and swindling. An American con man Michael Nash (Conway Tearle) develops a moral conscience after falling in love with Pringle's character, Zara, and is consistent with Browning's \"themes of reformation and unpunished crimes.\" and the couple achieve a happy reckoning. Browning, a former sideshow performer, is quick to reveal to his movie audience the illusionist fakery that serves to extract a fortune from a gullible heiress, played by Gladys Hulette.\n\"Dollar Down\" (1925): Browning followed \"The Mystic\" with another \"crook melodrama involving swindlers\" for Truart productions. Based on a story by Jane Courthope and Ethyl Hill, \"Dollar Down\" stars Ruth Roland and Henry B. Walthall.\nFollowing these \"more conventional\" crime films, Browning and Chaney embarked on their final films of the late silent period, \"the strangest collaboration between director and actor in cinema history; the premises of the films were outrageous.\"\n\"The Blackbird\" (1926).\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBrowning helps to keep the development of \"The Blackbird\" taut by employing Chaney's face as an index of the rapidly oscillating mood of the title character. Chaney is the key person who will determine the fates of West End Bertie and Fifi. The plasticity of his facial expressions belies to the audience the spirit of cooperation he offers the young couple...the internal explosiveness monitored in his face is a constant reminder of the danger represented by his presence. \u2014 Biographer Stuart Rosenthal in \"Tod Browning: The Hollywood Professionals, Volume 4\" (1975)\nBrowning and Chaney were reunited in their next feature film, \"The Blackbird\" (1926), one of the most \"visually arresting\" of their collaborations.\nBrowning introduces Limehouse district gangster Dan Tate (Chaney), alias \"The Blackbird\", who creates an alter identity, the physically deformed christian missionary \"The Bishop.\" Tate's purported \"twin\" brother is a persona he uses to periodically evade suspicion by the police under \"a phony mantle of christian goodness\"\u2014an image utterly at odds with the persona of The Blackbird. According to film historian Stuart Rosenthal, \"Tate's masquerade as the Bishop succeeds primarily because the Bishop's face so believably reflects a profound spiritual suffering that is absolutely foreign to the title character [The Blackbird].\"\nTate's competitor in crime, the \"gentleman-thief\" Bertram \"West End Bertie\" Glade (Owen Moore, becomes romantically involved with a Limehouse cabaret singer, Mademoiselle Fifi Lorraine (Ren\u00e9e Ador\u00e9e). The jealous Tate attempts to frame Bertie for the murder of a policeman, but is mortally injured in an accident while in the guise of The Bishop. Tate's wife, Polly (Doris Lloyd discovers her husband's dual identity, and honors him by concealing his role as \"The Blackbird.\" The reformed Bertie and his lover Fifi are united in matrimony.\nChaney's adroit \"quick-change\" transformations from the Blackbird into The Bishop\u2014intrinsic to the methods of \"show culture\"\u2014are \"explicitly revealed\" to the movie audience, such that Browning invites them to share in the deception.\nBrowning introduces a number of slapstick elements into \"The Blackbird\". Doris Lloyd, portrays Tate's ex-wife Limehouse Polly, demonstrating her comic acumen in scenes as a flower girl, and Browning's Limehouse drunkards are \"archetypical of burlesque cinema.\" Film historian Boris Henry points out that \"it would not be surprising if the fights that Lon Chaney as Dan Tate mimes between his two characters (The Blackbird and The Bishop) were inspired by actor-director Max Linder's performance in Be My Wife, 1921.\"\nFilm historian Stuart Rosenthal identifies Browning's characterization of Dan Tate/the Blackbird as a species of vermin lacking in nobility, a parasitic scavenger that feeds on carrion and is unworthy of sympathy. In death, according to film critic Nicole Brenez, The Blackbird \"is deprived of [himself]...death, then, is no longer a beautiful vanishing, but a terrible spiriting away.\"\nThough admired by critics for Chaney's performance, the film was only modestly successful at the box office.\n\"The Road to Mandalay\" (1926).\nAny comprehensive contemporary evaluation of Browning's \"The Road to Mandalay\" is problematic. According to Browning biographer Alfred Eaker only a small fraction of the original seven reels exist. A 16\u00a0mm version survives in a \"fragmented and disintegrated state\" discovered in France in the 1980s.\nIn a story that Browning wrote with screenwriter Herman Mankiewicz , \"The Road to Mandalay\" (not related to author Rudyard Kipling's 1890 poem), is derived from the character \"dead-eyed\" Singapore Joe (Lon Chaney), a Singapore brothel operator. As Browning himself explained:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The [story] writes itself after I have conceived the characters... the same for \"The Road to Mandalay\". The initial idea was that of a man so frightfully ugly that he was ashamed to reveal himself to his own daughter. In this way one can develop any story.\nThe picture explores one of Browning's most persistent themes: that of a parent who asserts sexual authority vicariously through their own offspring. As such, an Oedipal narrative is established, \"a narrative that dominates Browning's work\" and recognized as such by contemporary critics.\nJoe's daughter, Rosemary (Lois Moran), now a young adult, has been raised in a convent where her father left her as an infant with her uncle, Father James (Henry B. Walthall). Rosemary is ignorant of her parentage; she lives a chaste and penurious existence. Brothel keeper Joe makes furtive visits to the shop where she works as a clerk. His attempts to anonymously befriend the girl are met with revulsion at his freakish appearance. Joe resolves to undergo plastic surgery to achieve a rapprochement with his daughter and redeem his sordid history. Father James doubts his brothers' commitment to reform and to reestablish his parenthood. A conflict emerges when Joe's cohorts and rivals in crime, \"The Admiral\" Herrington (Owen Moore) and English Charlie Wing (Kamiyama Sojin), members of \"the black spiders of the Seven Seas\" appear on the scene. The Admiral encounters Rosemary at the bazaar where she works and is instantly smitten with her; his genuine resolve to abandon his criminal life wins Rosemary's devotion and a marriage is arranged. When Joe discovers these developments, the full force of his \"sexual frustrations\" are unleashed. Joe's attempt to thwart his daughter's efforts to escape his control ends when Rosemary stabs her father, mortally wounding him. The denouement is achieved when the dying Joe consents to her marriage and Father James performs the last rites upon his brother.\nFilm critic Alfred Eaker observes: \"\"The Road to Mandalay\" is depraved, pop-Freudian, silent melodrama at its ripest. Fortunately, both Browning and Chaney approach this hodgepodge of silliness in dead earnest.\" Religious imagery commonly appears in Browning's films, \"surrounding his characters with religious paraphernalia.\" Browning, a mason, uses Christian iconography to emphasize Joe's moral alienation from Rosemary. Biographer Stuart Rosenthal writes:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;As Singapore Joe gazes longingly at his daughter...the display of crucifixes that [surrounds her] testifies of his love for her while paradoxically acting as a barrier between them.\nRosenthal adds \"\"Religion for the Browning hero is an additional spring of frustration \u2013 another defaulted promise.\"\nAs in all of the Browning-Chaney collaborations, \"The Road to Mandalay\" was profitable at the box office.\n\"London After Midnight\" (1927).\nWhereas Browning's \"The Road to Mandalay\" (1926) exists in a much deteriorated 16\u00a0mm abridged version, \"London After Midnight\" is no longer believed to exist, the last print destroyed in an MGM vault fire in 1965.\n\"London After Midnight\" is widely considered by archivists the Holy Grail and \"the most sought after and discussed lost film of the silent era.\" A detailed photo reconstruction, based on stills from the film was assembled by Turner Classic Movies' Rick Schmidlin in 2002.\nBased on Browning's own tale entitled \"The Hypnotist\", \"London After Midnight\" is a \"drawing room murder mystery'\u2014its macabre and Gothic atmosphere resembling director Robert Wiene's 1920 \"The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari\".\nSir Roger Balfour is found dead at the estate of his friend Sir James Hamlin. The gunshot wound to Balfour's head appears self-inflicted. The Scotland Yard inspector and forensic hypnotist in charge, \"Professor\" Edward C. Burke (Lon Chaney) receives no reports of foul play and the death is deemed a suicide. Five years past, and the estates current occupants are alarmed by a ghoulish, fanged figure wearing a cape and top hat stalking the hallways at night. He is accompanied by a corpse-like female companion. The pair of intruders are the disguised Inspector Burke, masquerading as a vampire (also played by Chaney), and his assistant, \"Luna, the Bat Girl\" (Edna Tichenor). When the terrified residents call Scotland Yard, Inspector Burke appears and reopens Balfour's case as a homicide. Burke uses his double role to stage a series of elaborate illusions and applications of hypnotism to discover the identity of the murderer among Balfour's former associates.\nBrowning's \"preposterous\" plot is the platform on which he demonstrates the methods of magic and show culture, reproducing the mystifying spectacles of \"spirit theater\" that purport to operate through the paranormal. Browning's cinematic illusions are conducted strictly through mechanical stage apparatus: no trick photography is employed. \"illusion, hypnotism and disguise\" are used to mimic the conceits and pretenses of the occult, but primarily for dramatic effect and only to reveal them as tricks.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n Mystery stories are tricky, for if they are too gruesome or horrible, if they exceed the average imagination by too much, the audience will laugh. \"London After Midnight\" is an example of how to get people to accept ghosts and other supernatural spirits by letting them turn out to be the machinations of a detective. Thereby the audience is not asked to believe the horrible impossible, but the horrible possible, and plausibility increased, rather than lessened, the thrill and chills. \u2014 Tod Browning commenting on his cinematic methods in an interview with Joan Dickey for \"Motion Picture Magazine\", March 1928\nAfter the murderer is apprehended, Browning's Inspector Burke/The Man in the Beaver Hat reveals the devices and techniques he has used to extract the confession, while systematically disabusing the cast characters\u2014and the movie audience\u2014of any supernatural influence on the foregoing events. Film historians Stefanie Diekmann and Ekkehard Kn\u00f6rer observe succinctly that \"All in all, Browning's scenarios [including London After Midnight] appear as a long series of tricks, performed and explained.\"\nLon Chaney's make-up to create the menacing \"Man with the Beaver Hat\" is legendary. Biographer Alfred Eaker writes: \"Chaney's vampire...is a make-up artist's delight, and an actor's hell. Fishing wire looped around his blackened eye sockets, a set of painfully inserted, shark-like teeth producing a hideous grin, a ludicrous wig under a top hat, and white pancake makeup achieved Chaney's kinky look. To add to the effect Chaney developed a misshapen, incongruous walk for the character.\"\nLondon After Midnight received a mixed critical response, but delivered handsomely at the box office \"grossing over $1,000,000 in 1927 dollars against a budget of $151,666.14.\"\n\"The Show\" (1927).\nIn 1926, while Lon Chaney was busy making \"Tell It to the Marines\" with filmmaker George W. Hill, Browning directed The Show, \"one of the most bizarre productions to emerge from silent cinema.\" (\"The Show\" anticipates his subsequent feature with Chaney, a \"carnival of terror\": \"The Unknown\").\nScreenwriter Waldemar Young based the scenario on elements from the author Charles Tenny Jackson's \"The Day of Souls\".\n\"The Show\" is a \"tour-de-force\" demonstration of Browning's penchant for the spectacle of carnival sideshow acts combined with the revelatory exposure of the theatrical apparatus and techniques that create these illusions. Film historian Matthew Solomon notes that \"this is not specific to his films with Lon Chaney.\" Indeed, \"The Show\" features two of MGM's leading actors: John Gilbert, as the unscrupulous ballyhoo Cock Robin, and Ren\u00e9e Ador\u00e9e as his tempestuous lover, Salome. Actor Lionel Barrymore plays the homicidal Greek. Romantic infidelities, the pursuit of a small fortune, a murder, attempted murders, Cock Robin's moral redeemtion and his reconciliation with Salome comprise the plot and its \"saccarine\" ending.\nBrowning presents a menagerie of circus sideshow novelty acts from the fictitious \"Palace of Illusions\", including disembodied hands delivering tickets to customers; an illusionary beheading of a biblical figure (Gilbert as John the Baptist); Neptuna (Betty Boyd) Queen of the Mermaids; the sexually untoward Zela (Zalla Zarana) Half-Lady; and Arachnida (Edna Tichenor, the Human Spider perched on her web. Browning ultimately reveals \"how the trick is done\", explicating the mechanical devices to the film audience \u2013 not to the film's carnival patrons.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nYou see, now he's got the fake sword. \u2014 intertitle remark by an onscreen observer of Browning's \"detailed reconstruction\" of an illusionary theatrical beheading in \"The Show\". \u2014 Film historian Matthew Solomon in \"Staging Deception: Theatrical Illusionism in Browning's Films of the 1920s\" (2006)\nThe central dramatic event of \"The Show\" derives from another literary work, a \"magic playlet\" by Oscar Wilde entitled \"Salom\u00e9\" (1896). Browning devises an elaborate and \"carefully choreographed\" sideshow reenactment of Jokanaan's biblical beheading (played by Gilbert), with Ador\u00e9e as Salom\u00e9 presiding over the lurid decapitation, symbolic of sadomasochism and castration.\n\"The Show\" received generally good reviews, but approval was muted due to Gilbert's unsavory character, Cock Robin. Browning was now poised to make his masterwork of the silent era, \"The Unknown\" (1927).\n\"The Unknown\" (1927): A silent era chef d'oeuvre.\n\"The Unknown\" marks the creative apogee of the Tod Browning and Lon Chaney collaborations, and is widely considered their most outstanding work of the silent era. More so than any of Browning's silent pictures, he fully realizes one of his central themes in \"The Unknown\": the linkage of physical deformity with sexual frustration.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n [The story] writes itself after I have conceived the characters. \"The Unknown\" came to me after I had the idea of a man [Alonzo] without arms. I then asked myself what are the most amazing situations and actions that a man thus reduced could be involved... \u2014 Tod Browning in \"Motion Picture Classic\" interview, 1928\nI contrived to make myself look like an armless man, not simply to shock and horrify you but merely to bring to the screen a dramatic story of an armless man. \u2014 Actor Lon Chaney, on his creation of the character Alonzo in \"The Unknown\".\nCircus performer \"Alonzo the armless\", a Gypsy knife-thrower, appears as a double amputee, casting his knives with his feet. His deformity is an illusion (except for a bifid thumb), achieved by donning a corset to bind and conceal his healthy arms. The able-bodied Alonzo, sought by the police, engages in this deception to evade detection and arrest. Alonzo harbors a secret love for Nanon (Joan Crawford), his assistant in the act. Nanon's father is the abusive (perhaps sexually so) ringmaster Zanzi (Nick De Ruiz), and Nanon has developed a pathological aversion to any man's embrace. Her emotional dysfunction precludes any sexual intimacy with the highly virile strong-man, Malabar, or Alonzo, his own sexual prowess symbolized by his knife-throwing expertise and his double thumb. When Alonzo murders Zanzi during an argument, the homicide is witnessed by Nanon, who detects only the bifid thumb of her father's assailant.\nBrowning's theme of sexual frustration and physical mutilation ultimately manifests itself in Alonzo's act of symbolic castration; he willingly has his arms amputated by an unlicensed surgeon so as to make himself unthreatening to Nanon (and to eliminate the incriminating bifid thumb), so as to win her affection. The \"nightmarish irony\" of Alonzo's sacrifice is the most outrageous of Browning's plot conceits and consistent with his obsessive examination of \"sexual frustration and emasculation\". When Alonzo recovers from his surgery, he returns to the circus to find that Nanon has overcome her sexual aversions and married the strongman Malabar (Norman Kerry). The primal ferocity of Alonzo's reaction to Nanon's betrayal in marrying Malabar is instinctual. Film historian Stuart Rosenthal writes:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The reversion to an animalistic state in Browning's cinema functions as a way of acquiring raw power to be used as a means of sexual assertion. The incident that prompts the regression [to an animal state] and a search for vengeance is, in almost every case, sexual in nature.\nAlonzo's efforts at retribution lead to his own horrific death in a \"Grand Guignol finale\".\n\"The Unknown\" is widely regarded as the most outstanding of the Browning-Chaney collaborations and a masterpiece of the late silent film era. Film critic Scott Brogan regards \"The Unknown\" worthy of \"cult status.\"\n\"The Big City\" (1928).\nA lost film, \"The Big City\" stars Lon Chaney, Marceline Day and Betty Compson, the latter in her only appearance in an MGM film. Browning wrote the story and Waldemar Young the screenplay concerning \"A gangster Lon Chaney who uses a costume jewelry store as a front for his jewel theft operation. After a conflict with a rival gang, he and his girlfriend Marceline Day reform.\"\nFilm historian Vivian Sobchack remarked that \"\"The Big City\" concerns a nightclub robbery, again, the rivalry between two thieves. This time Chaney plays only one of them\u2014without a twisted limb or any facial disguise.'\" Critic Stuart Rosenthal commented on \"The Big City\": \"...Chaney, without makeup, in a characteristic gangster role.\"\n\"The Big City\" garnered MGM $387,000 in profits.\n\"West of Zanzibar\" (1928).\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nIn \"West of Zanzibar\" Browning bares his carnival showman background not to betray himself as an aesthetic primitive, but to display his complete comprehension of the presentational mode, and of the film frame as proscenium...Browning remains neglected because most of the available English-language writing on his films focuses on the thematic singularities of his oeuvre, to the near-exclusion of any analysis of his aesthetic strategies. \u2014 Film critic Brian Darr in \"Senses of Cinema\" (July 2010)\nIn 1928, Browning and Lon Chaney embarked upon their penultimate collaboration, West of Zanzibar, based on Chester M. De Vonde play \"Kongo\" (1926).\nscenario by Elliott J. Clawson and Waldemar Young, provided Chaney with dual characterizations: the magician Pharos, and the later paraplegic Pharos who is nicknamed \"Dead Legs.\" A variation of the \"unknown parentage motif\" Browning dramatizes a complex tale of \"obsessive revenge\" and \"psychological horror.\" Biographer Stuart Rosenthal made these observations on Chaney's portrayals:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Dead Legs is one of the ugliest and most incorrigible of Browning's heroes...Chaney demonstrated great sensitivity to the feelings and drives of the outcasts Browning devised for him to play. Browning may well be the only filmmaker who saw Chaney as more than an attention-getting gimmick. While many of Chaney's films for other directors involve tales of retribution, only in the Browning vehicles is he endowed with substantial human complexity.\nThe story opens in Paris, where Pharos, a magician, is cuckolded by his wife Anna (Jacqueline Gadsden) and her lover Crane (Lionel Barrymore). Pharos is crippled when Crane pushes him from a balcony, leaving him a paraplegic. Anna and Crane abscond to Africa. After a year, Phroso learns that Anna has returned. He finds his wife dead in a church, with an infant daughter beside her. He swears to avenge himself both on Crane and the child he assumes was sired by Crane. Unbeknownst to Phroso, the child is actually his. Rosenthal singles out this scene for special mention:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The religious symbolism that turns up periodically in Browning's pictures serves two antagonistic ends. When Dead Legs discovers his dead wife and her child on the pulpit of the cathedral, the solemn surrounding lend a tone of fanatical irrevocability to his vow to make \"Crane and his brat pay.\" At the same time, Chaney's difficult and painful movements upon his belly at the front of the church have the look of a savage parody of a religious supplicant whose faith has been rendered a mockery. God's justice having failed, Dead Legs is about to embark upon his mission of righteousness.\nEighteen years hence, the crippled Pharos, now dubbed Dead Legs, operates an African trading outpost. He secretly preys upon Crane's ivory operations employing local tribes and using sideshow tricks and illusions to seize the goods. After years of anticipation, Dead Legs prepares to hatch his \"macabre revenge\": a sinister double murder. He summons Anna's daughter Maizie (Mary Nolan) from the sordid brothel and gin mill where he has left her to be raised. He also invites Crane to visit his outpost so as to expose the identity of the culprit stealing his ivory. Dead Legs has arranged to have Crane murdered, but not before informing him that he will invoke the local Death Code, which stipulates that \"a man's demise be followed by the death of his wife or child.\" Crane mockingly disabuses Dead Legs of his gross misapprehension: Maizie is Dead Legs' daughter, not his, a child that Pharos conceived with Anna in Paris. Crane is killed before Dead Legs can absorb the significance of this news.\nThe climax of the film involves Dead Legs' struggle to save his own offspring from the customary death sentence that his own deadly scheme has set in motion. Dead Legs ultimately suffers the consequences of his \"horribly misdirected revenge ploy.\" The redemptive element with which Browning-Chaney endows Pharos/Dead Legs fate is noted by Rosenthal: \"\"West of Zanzibar\" reaches the peak of its psychological horror when Chaney discovers that the girl he is using as a pawn in his revenge scheme is his own daughter. Dead Legs undertook his mission of revenge with complete confidence in the righteousness of his cause. Now he is suddenly overwhelmed by the realization of his own guilt. That Barrymore as Crane committed the original transgression in no way diminishes that guilt.\"\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nA Browning hero would never feel a compulsion to symbolically relive a moment of humiliation. Instead of taking the philosophical route of subjugating himself to his frustration, Browning's Chaney opts for the primitive satisfaction of striking back, of converting his emotional upheaval into a source of primal strength. The viewer, empathizing with the protagonist, is shocked at the realization of his own potential for harnessing the power of his sense of outrage. This is one of the reasons why West of Zanzibar, and Chaney's other Browning films are so much more disturbing than the horror mysteries he made with other directors. \u2014 Stuart Rosenthal in \"Tod Browning: The Hollywood Professionals, Volume 4\" (1975)\nDead Legs' physical deformity reduces him to crawling on the ground, and thus to the \"state of an animal.\" Browning's camera placement accentuates his snake-like \"slithering\" and establishes \"his animal transformation by suddenly changing the visual frame of reference to one that puts the viewer on the same level as the beast on the screen, thereby making him vulnerable to it, accomplished by tilting the camera up at floor level in front of the moving subject [used to] accentuate Chaney's [Dead Legs] slithering movements in West of Zanzibar.\" Film historians Stephanie Diekmann and Ekkehard Kn\u00f6rer state more generally \"...the spectator in Browning's films can never remain a voyeur; or rather, he is never safe in his voyeuristic position...\"\nDiekmann and Kn\u00f6rer also place \"West of Zanzibar\" in the within the realm of the Grand Guignol tradition:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt; As far as plots are concerned, the proximity of Tod Browning's cinema to the theater of the Grand Guignol is evident...From the castrating mutilation of \"The Unholy Three\" (1925) to the sadistic cruelty and bestial brutality intermingled with the orientalising\n\"chinoiserie\" of \"Where East Is East\" (1929); from the horribly misdirected revenge ploy of \"West of Zanzibar\" (1928); to the no less horribly successful revenge plot of \"Freaks\" (1932); from the double-crossing gunplay of \"The Mystic\" to the erotically charged twists and turns of \"The Show\": on the level of plot alone, all these are close in spirit and explicitness to Andre de Lorde's theatre of fear and horror.\nDespite being characterized as a \"cess-pool\" by the censorious Harrison's Reports motion picture trade journal, \"West of Zanzibar\" enjoyed popular success at the box office.\n\"Where East Is East\" (1929).\nAdapted by Waldemar Young from a story by Browning and Harry Sinclair Drago, \"Where East Is East\" borrows its title from the opening and closing verses of Rudyard Kipling's 1889 poem \"The Ballad of East and West\": \"Oh! East is East, and West is West, and never the twain shall meet...\" Browning's appropriation of the term \"Where East Is East\" is both ironic and subversive with regard to his simultaneous cinematic presentation of Eurocentric cliches of the \"East\" (common in early 20th century advertising, literature and film), and his exposure of these memes as myths. Film historian Stefan Brandt writes that this verse was commonly invoked by Western observers to reinforce conceptions stressing \"the homogeneity and internal consistency of 'The East'\" and points out that Kipling (born and raised in Bombay, India) was \"far from being one-dimensional\" when his literary work \"dismantles the myth of ethnic essentiality\":\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Browning's \"Where East Is East\"...playfully reenacts the symbolic dimension contained in Kipling's phrase. The expression not only emerges in the movie's title; the vision of the East that is negotiated and shown in all its absurdity here is very much akin to that associated with Kipling.\nBiographer Bernd Herzogenrath adds that \"paradoxically, the film both essentializes the East as a universal and homogeneous entity (\"Where East Is East\") and deconstructs it as a Western myth consisting of nothing but colorful [male] fantasies.\" [brackets and parentheses in original]\nThe last of Browning-Chaney collaborations with an \"outrageous premise\" and their final silent era film, \"Where East Is East\" was marketed by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer \"as a colonial drama in the mold of British imperialist fiction.\"\n\"Where East Is East\", set in the \"picturesque French Indo-China of the 1920s\" concerns the efforts of big game trapper \"Tiger\" Haynes (Chaney) intervention to stop his beloved half-Chinese daughter Toyo (Lupe Velez) from marrying Bobby \"white boy\" Bailey, a Western suitor and son of a circus owner. He relents when Bobby rescues Toyo from an escaped tiger. The Asian seductress, Madame de Sylva (Estelle Taylor), Tiger's former wife and mother to Toyo\u2014who abandoned her infant to be raised by Tiger\u2014returns to lure Bobby from Toyo and ruin the couple's plans for conjugal bliss. Tiger takes drastic action, unleashing a gorilla which dispatches Madame de Sylva but mortally wounds Tiger. He lives long enough witness the marriage of Toyo and Bobby.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nAt first glance, Browning's \"Where East Is East\" seems to deploy many of the well-known stereotypes concerning the Orient that were familiar from [Hollywood] productions of the 1910s and 1920s.\u2014 above all, in the notion of the East as fundamentally different and unique. At the same time the concept that 'East is East' is satirized through the staging of the Orient as an assortment of costumes and gestures. The conjunction 'where' [in the movie's title] hints at the fictional dimension that the East accrued through Hollywood films. In Browning's ironic use of Kipling's phrase, it is, above all, this constructed world of cinematic fiction that harbors the myth of the East... it is only \"there\" that 'East is East.' \u2014 Film historian Stefan Brandt in \"White Bo[d]y in Wonderland: Cultural Alterity and Sexual Desire in\" Where East Is East (2006)\nIn a key sequence in which the American Bobby Bailey (Lloyd Hughes), nicknamed \"white boy\", is briefly seduced by the Asian Madame de Sylva (mother to Bobby's fiancee Toya), Browning offers a cliche-ridden intertitle exchange that is belied by his cinematic treatment. Film historian Stefan Brandt writes: \"Browning here plays with the ambiguities involved in the common misreading of Kipling's poem, encouraging his American audience to question the existing patterns of colonial discourse and come to conclusions that go beyond that mode of thinking. The romantic version of the Orient as a land of eternal mysticism is exposed here as a Eurocentric illusion that we must not fall prey to.\"\nBrowning's presentation of the alluring Madame de Sylva -whose French title diverges from her Asian origins- introduces one of Browning's primary themes: \"Reality vs. Appearance\". Rosenthal notes that \"physical beauty masking perversity is identical to the usual Browning premise of respectability covering corruption. This is the formula used in \"Where East Is East\". Tiger's thorny face masks a wealth of kindness, sensitively and abiding paternal love. But behind the exotic beauty of Madame de Silva lies an unctuous, sinister manner and callous spitefulness.\"\nThe animal imagery with which Browning invests \"Where East Is East\" informed Lon Chaney's characterization of Tiger Haynes, the name alone identifying him as both \"tiger hunter and the tiger himself.\" Biographer Stuart Rosenthal comments on the Browning-Chaney characterization of Tiger Haynes:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Tiger's bitterness in \"Where East is East\" is the result of disgust for Madame de Silva's past and present treachery. [Tiger Haynes] is striving desperately to overcome [his] inner embarrassment and, by revenging himself, re-establish his personal feelings of sexual dominance.\nAs in Browning's \"The Unknown\" (1927) in which protagonist Alonzo is trampled to death by a horse, \"animals become the agents of destruction for Tiger [Haynes] in \"Where East Is East\".\"\nSound films: 1929\u20131939.\nUpon completing \"Where East Is East\", MGM prepared to make his first sound production, \"The Thirteenth Chair\" (1929). The question as to Browning's adaptability to the film industry's ineluctable transition to sound technology is disputed among film historians.\nBiographers David Skal and Elias Savada report that Browning \"had made his fortune as a silent film director but had considerable difficulties in adapting his talents to talking pictures.\" Film critic Vivian Sobchack notes that Browning, in both his silent and sound creations, \"starts with the visual rather than the narrative\" and cites director Edgar G. Ulmer: \"until the end of his career, Browning tried to avoid using dialogue; he wanted to obtain visual effects.\" Biographer Jon Towlson argues that Browning's 1932 Freaks reveals \"a director in full control of the [sound] medium, able to use the camera to reveal a rich subtext beneath the dialogue\" and at odds with the general assessment of the filmmakers post-silent era pictures.\nBrowning's sound oeuvre consists of nine features before his retirement from filmmaking in 1939.\n\"The Thirteenth Chair \"(1929).\nBrowning's first sound film, \"The Thirteenth Chair\" is based on a 1916 \"drawing room murder mystery\" stage play of the same title by Bayard Veiller first adapted to film in a 1919 silent version and later a sound remake in 1937.\nSet in Calcutta, the story concerns two homicides committed at s\u00e9ances. Illusion and deception are employed to expose the murderer.\nIn a cast featuring some of MGM's top contract players including Conrad Nagel, Leila Hyams and Margaret Wycherly Hungarian-American Bela Lugosi, a veteran of silent films and the star of Broadway's \"Dracula\" (1924) was enlisted by Browning to play Inspector Delzante, when Lon Chaney declined to yet embark on a talking picture.\nThe first of his three collaborations with Lugosi, Browning's handling of the actor's role as Delzante anticipated the part of Count Dracula in his \"Dracula\" (1931). Browning endows Lugosi's Delzante with bizarre eccentricities, including a guttural, broken English and heavily accented eyebrows, characteristics that Lugosi made famous in his film roles as vampires. Film historian Alfred Eaker remarks: \"Serious awkwardness mars this film, a product from that transitional period from silent to the new, imposing medium of sound. Because of that awkwardness \"The Thirteenth Chair\" is not Browning in best form.\"\n\"Outside the Law\" (1930).\nA remake of Browning's 1921 silent version starred Priscilla Dean and Lon Chaney who appeared in dual roles. \"Outside the Law\" concerns a criminal rivalry among gangsters. It stars Edward G. Robinson as Cobra Collins and Mary Nolan as his moll Connie Madden. Film critic Alfred Eaker commented that Browning's remake \"received comparatively poor reviews.\"\n\"Dracula\" (1931): The first talkie horror picture.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n\"I am Dracula.\" \u2013 Bela Lugosi's iconic introduction as the vampire Count Dracula\nBrowning's \"Dracula\" initiated the modern horror genre, and it remains his only \"one true horror film.\" Today the picture stands as the first of Browning's two sound era masterpieces, rivaled only by his \"Freaks\" (1932). The picture set in motion Universal Studios' highly lucrative production of vampire and monster movies during the 1930s. Browning approached Universal's Carl Laemmle Jr. in 1930 to organize a film version of Bram Stoker's 1897 gothic horror novel \"Dracula\", previously adapted to film by director F. W. Murnau in 1922.\nIn an effort to avoid copyright infringement lawsuits, Universal opted to base the film on Hamilton Deane's and Louis Bromfield's melodramatic stage version \"Dracula\" (1924), rather than Stoker's novel.\nActor Lon Chaney, then completing his first sound film with director Jack Conway in a remake of Browning's silent \"The Unholy Three\" (1925), was tapped for the role of Count Dracula. Terminally ill from lung cancer, Chaney entered negotiations for the project. The actor died a few short weeks before shooting was set to commence on \"Dracula\" \u2014 a significant personal and professional loss to long-time collaborator Browning. Hungarian expatriate and actor Bela Ferenc Deszo Blasco, appearing under the stage name Bela Lugosi, had successfully performed the role of Count Dracula in the American productions of the play for three years. According to film historian David Thomson, \"when Chaney died, it was taken for granted that Lugosi would have the role in the film.\"\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThe most awesome powers of control belong to the vampires, and Browning's attitude toward these undead poses a particularly intriguing problem. The vampires depend, for support, upon the infirm and innocent elements of society the Browning scorns. They sustain themselves through the blood of the weak...but they are vulnerable to those with the determination to resist them. \u2013 Stuart Rosenthal in \"Tod Browning: The Hollywood Professionals, Volume 4\" (1975)\nLugosi's portrayal of Count Dracula is inextricably linked to the vampire genre established by Browning. As film critic Elizabeth Bronfen observes, \"the notoriety of Browning's Dracula within film history resides above all else in the uncanny identification between Bela Lugosi and his role.\" Browning quickly establishes what would become Dracula's\u2014 and Bela Lugosi's\u2014\"sine qua non\": \"The camera repeatedly focuses on Dracula's hypnotic gaze, which, along with his idiosyncratic articulation, was to become his cinematic trademark.\" Film historian Alec Charles observes that \"The first time we see Bela Lugosi in Tod Browning's Dracula...he looks almost directly into the camera...Browning affords the audience the first of those famously intense and direct into-the-camera Lugosi looks, a style of gaze that would be duplicated time and again by the likes of Christopher Lee and Lugosi's lesser imitators...\" Lugosi embraced his screen persona as the preeminent \"aristocratic Eastern European vampire\" and welcomed his typecasting, assuring his \"artistic legacy\".\nFilm critic Elizabeth Bronfen reports that Browning's cinematic interpretation of the script has been widely criticized by film scholars. Browning is cited for failing to provide adequate \"montage or shot/reverse shots\", the \"incoherence of the narrative\" and his putative poor handling of the \"implausible dialogue\" reminiscent of \"filmed theatre.\" Bronfen further notes critic's complaints that Browning failed to visually record the iconic vampiric catalog: puncture wounds on a victims necks, the imbibing of fresh blood, a stake penetrating the heart of Count Dracula. Moreover, no \"transformation scenes\" are visualized in which the undead or vampires morph into wolves or bats.\nFilm critics have attributed these \"alleged faults\" to Browning's lack of enthusiasm for the project. Actor Helen Chandler, who plays Dracula's mistress, Mina Seward, commented that Browning seemed disengaged during shooting, and left the direction to cinematographer Karl Freund.\nBronfen emphasizes the \"financial constraints\" imposed by Universal executives, strictly limiting authorization for special effects or complex technical shots, and favoring a static camera requiring Browning to \"shoot in sequence\" in order to improve efficiency. Bronfen suggests that Browning's own thematic concerns may have prompted him\u2014in this, 'the first talkie horror picture'\u2014to privilege the spoken word over visual tricks.\":\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Browning's concern was always with the bizarre desires of those on the social and cultural margins. It is enough for him to render their fantasies as scenic fragments, which require neither a coherent, nor a sensational story line... the theatricality of his filmic rendition emphasizes both the power of suggestion emanating from Count Dracula's hypnotic gaze and Professor Van Helsing's will power, as well as the seduction transmitted by foregrounding the voices of the marginal and monstrous... even the choice of a static camera seems logical, once one sees it as an attempt to savour the newly discovered possibilities of sound as a medium of seductive film horror.\nThe scenario follows the vampire Count Dracula to England where he preys upon members of the British upper-middle class, but is confronted by nemesis Professor Van Helsing, (Edward Van Sloan) who possesses sufficient will power and knowledge of vampirism to defeat Count Dracula. Film historian Stuart Rosenthal remarks that \"the Browning version of Dracula retains the Victorian formality of the original source in the relationships among the normal characters. In this atmosphere the seething, unstoppable evil personified by the Count is a materialization of Victorian morality's greatest dread.\"\nA number of sequences in \"Dracula\" have earned special mention, despite criticism concerning the \"static and stagy quality of the film.\" The dramatic and sinister opening sequence in which the young solicitor Renfield (Dwight Frye) is conveyed in a coach to Count Dracula's Transylvanian castle is one of the most discussed and praised of the picture. Karl Freund's Expressionistic technique is largely credited with its success.\nBrowning employs \"a favorite device\" with an animal montage early in the film to establish a metaphoric equivalence between the emergence of the vampires from their crypts and the small parasitic vermin that infest the castle: spiders, wasps and rats. Unlike Browning's previous films, \"Dracula\" is not a \"long series of [illusionist] tricks, performed and explained\" but rather an application of cinematic effects \"presenting vampirism as scientifically verified 'reality'.\"\nDespite Universal executives editing out portions of Browning's film, Dracula was enormously successful. Opening at New York City's Roxy Theatre, \"Dracula\" earned $50,000 in 48 hours, and was Universal's most lucrative film of the Depression Era. Five years after its release, it had grossed over one million dollars worldwide. Film critic Dennis Harvey writes: \"Dracula's enormous popularity fast-tracked Browning's return to MGM, under highly favorable financial terms and the protection of longtime ally, production chief Irving Thalberg.\"\n\"Iron Man\" (1931).\nThe last of Browning's three sound films he directed for Universal Studios, \"Iron Man\" (1931) is largely ignored in critical literature.\nDescribed as \"a cautionary tale about the boxer as a physically powerful man brought down by a woman\", Browning's boxing story lacks the macabre elements that typically dominate his cinema. Film historian Vivian Sobchack observes that \"Iron Man, in subject and plot, is generally regarded as uncharacteristic of Browning's other work.\" Thematically, however, the picture exhibits a continuity consistent with his obsessive interest in \"situations of moral and sexual frustration.\"\nFilm critic Leger Grindon cites the four \"subsidiary motifs\" recognized by Browning biographer Stuart Rosenthal: \"appearances hiding truth (particularly physical beauty as a mask for villainy), sexual frustration, opposing tendencies within a protagonist that are often projected onto alter egos and finally, an inability to assign guilt.\" These themes are evident in Iron Man.\nActor Lew Ayres, following his screen debut in Universal's immensely successful anti-war themed \"All Quiet on the Western Front\" (1930), plays Kid Mason, a Lightweight boxing champion. This sports-drama concerns the struggle between the Kid's friend and manager George Regan Robert Armstrong, and the boxer's adulterous wife Rose (Jean Harlow) to prevail in a contest for his affection and loyalty.\nRather than relying largely upon \"editing and composition as expressive tools\" Browning moved away from a stationary camera \"toward a conspicuous use of camera movement\" under the influence of Karl Freund, cinematographer on the 1931 \"Dracula\". Iron Man exhibits this \"transformation\" in Browning's cinematic style as he entered the sound era. Leger Grindon provides this assessment of Browning's last picture for Universal:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"Iron Man\" is not an anomaly in Tod Browning's career; rather, it is a work that testifies to the continuity of his thematic concerns, as well as showcasing his growing facility with the camera after his work with [cameraman] Karl Fruend...\nThough box office earnings for \"Iron Man\" are unavailable, a measure of its success is indicated in the two remakes the film inspired: \"Some Blondes Are Dangerous\" (1937) and \"Iron Man\" (1950).\nBrowning returned to MGM after completing \"Iron Man\" to embark upon the most controversial film of his career: \"Freaks\" (1932).\nMagnum opus: \"Freaks\" (1932).\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFreaks may be one of the most compassionate movies ever made. \u2013 Film critic Andrew Sarris in \"The American Cinema: Directors and Directions, 1929\u20131968\" (1968) p. 229\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nNot even the most morbidly inclined could possibly find this picture to their liking. Saying it is horrible is putting it mildly. It is revolting to the extent of turning one's stomach...Anyone who considers this [to be] entertainment should be placed in the pathological ward in some hospital. \u2014 Harrison's Reports, 16 July 1932If \"Freaks\" has caused a furor in certain censor circles, the fault lies in the manner in which it was campaigned to the public. I found it to be an interesting and entertaining picture, and I did not have nightmares, nor did I attempt to murder any of my relatives. \u2014 \"Motion Picture Herald\", 23 July 1932\nAfter the spectacular success of \"Dracula\" (1931) at Universal, Browning returned to MGM, lured by a generous contract and enjoying the auspices of production manager Irving Thalberg. Anticipating a repeat of his recent success at Universal, Thalberg accepted Browning's story proposal based on Tod Robbins' circus-themed tale \"Spurs\" (1926).\nThe studio purchased the rights and enlisted screenwriter Willis Goldbeck and Leon Gordon to develop the script with Browning. Thalberg collaborated closely with the director on pre-production, but Browning completed all the actual shooting on the film without interference from studio executives. Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer's president, Louis B. Mayer, registered his disgust with the project from its inception and during the filming, but Thalberg successfully intervened on Browning's behalf to proceed with the film. The picture that emerged was Browning's \"most notorious and bizarre melodrama.\"\nA \"morality play\", \"Freaks\" centers around the cruel seduction of a circus sideshow midget Hans (Harry Earles) by a statuesque trapeze artist Cleopatra (Olga Baclanova). She and her lover, strongman Hercules (Henry Victor), scheme to murder the diminutive Hans for his inheritance money after sexually humiliating him. The community of freaks mobilizes in Hans' defense, meting out severe justice to Cleopatra and Hercules: the former trapeze beauty is surgically transformed into a sideshow freak.\nBrowning enlisted a cast of performers largely assembled from carnival freak shows\u2014a community and milieu both of which the director was intimately familiar. The circus freaks serve as dramatic and comedic players, central to the story's development, and do not appear in their respective sideshow routines as novelties.\nTwo major themes in Browning's work\u2014\"Sexual Frustration\" and \"Reality vs. Appearances\"\u2014emerge in \"Freaks\" from the conflict inherent in the physical incompatibility between Cleopatra and Hans.\nThe guileless Hans' self-delusional fantasy of winning the affection of Cleopatra\u2014\"seductive, mature, cunning and self-assured\"\u2014provokes her contempt, eliciting \"cruel sexual jests\" at odds with her attractive physical charms. Browning provides the moral rationale for the final reckoning with Cleopatra \"before\" she has discovered Hans' fortune and plans to murder him. Film historian Stuart Rosenthal explains:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;It is here that Browning justifies the disruption of an individual's sexual equanimity as a cause for retaliation. Cleopatra's decision to wed the dwarf for his wealth and then dispose of him is not, in itself, a significant advance in villainy...her most heinous crime is committed when she teases Hans by provocatively dropping her cape to the floor, then gleefully kneels to allow her victim to replace it upon her shoulders...This kind of exploitation appears more obscene by far than the fairly clean act of homicide.\nBrowning addresses another theme fundamental to his work: \"Inability to Assign Guilt\". The community of freaks delay judgement on Cleopatra when she insults Frieda (Daisy Earles), the midget performer who loves Hans. Their social solidarity cautions restraint, but when the assault on Hans becomes egregious, they act single-mindedly to punish the offender. Browning exonerates the freaks of any guilt: they are \"totally justified\" in their act of retribution. Stuart Rosenthal describes this doctrine, the \"crux\" of Browning's social ideal:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"Freaks\" is the film that is most explicit about the closeness of equability and retribution. The freaks live by a simple and unequivocal code that one imagines might be the crux of Browning's ideal for society: 'Offend one of them, and offend them all'...if anyone attempts to harm or take advantage of one of their number, the entire colony responds quickly and surely to mete out appropriate punishment.\nBrowning cinematic style in \"Freaks\" is informed by the precepts of German Expressionism, combining a subdued documentary-like realism with \"chiaroscuro shadow\" for dramatic effect.\nThe wedding banquet sequence in which Cleopatra and Hercules brutally degrade Hans is \"among the most discussed moments of \"Freaks\"\" and according to biographer Vivian Sobchack \"a masterpiece of sound and image, and utterly unique in conception and realization.\"\nThe final sequence in which the freaks carry out their \"shocking\" revenge and Cleopatra's fate is revealed \"achieves the most sustained level of high-pitched terror of any Browning picture.\"\n\"Freaks\" was given general release only after Thalberg excised 30 minutes of footage deemed offensive to the public.\nThough Browning had a long history of making profitable pictures at MGM, Freaks was a \"disaster\" at the box office, though earning mixed reviews among critics.\nBrowning's reputation as a reliable filmmaker among the Hollywood establishment was tarnished, and he completed only four more pictures before retiring from the industry after 1939. According to biographer Alfred Eaker, \"\"Freaks\", in effect, ended Browning's career.\"\n\"Fast Workers\" (1933).\nIn the aftermath of the commercial failure of his 1932 \"Freaks\", Browning was assigned to produce and direct (uncredited) an adaptation of John McDermott's play \"Rivets\".\nThe script for \"Fast Workers\" by Karl Brown and Laurence Stallings dramatizes the mutual infidelities, often humorous, that plague a m\u00e9nage \u00e0 trois comprising a high-rise construction worker and seducer Gunner Smith (John Gilbert), his co-worker and sidekick, Bucker Reilly (Robert Armstrong) and Mary (Mae Clarke), an attractive \"Gold digger\" seeking financial and emotional stability during the Great Depression. Browning brings to bear all the thematic modes that typically motivate his characters. Film historian Stuart Rosenthal writes:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;In \"Fast Workers\" the four varieties of frustration are so well integrated among themselves that it is difficult, if not impossible to say where one ends and another begins. These interrelations make it one of the most perplexing of Browning's films, especially with regard to morality and justice.\nThe betrayals, humiliations and retaliations that plague the characters, and the moral legitimacy of their behaviors remains unresolved. Rosenthal comments on Browning's ambivalence: \"\"Fast Workers\" is Browning's final cynical word on the impossibility of an individual obtaining justice, however righteous his cause, without critically sullying himself. Superficially, things have been set right. Gunner and Bucker are again friends and, together are equal to any wily female. Yet Gunner, the individual who is the most culpable, finds himself in the most secure position, while the basically well-intentioned Mary is rejected and condemned by both men.\" An outstanding example of Browning's ability to visually convey terror\u2014a technique he developed in the silent era\u2014is demonstrated when Mary perceives that Bucker, cuckolded by Gunner, reveals his homicidal rage.\nMetro-Goldwyn-Mayer committed $525,000 to the film's production budget, quite a high sum for a relatively short feature. Ultimately, MGM reported earnings of only $165,000 on the film after its release, resulting in a net loss of $360,000 on the motion picture.\n\"Mark of the Vampire\" (1935).\nBrowning returned to a vampire-themed picture with his 1935 \"Mark of the Vampire\". Rather than risk a legal battle with Universal Studios who held the rights to Browning's 1931 \"Dracula\", he opted for a reprise of his successful silent era \"London After Midnight\" (1927), made for MGM and starring Lon Chaney in a dual role.\nWith \"Mark of the Vampire\", Browning follows the plot conceit employed in \"London After Midnight\": An investigator and hypnotist seeks to expose a murderer by means of a \"vampire masquerade\" so as to elicit his confession. Browning deviates from his 1927 silent film in that here the sleuth, Professor Zelen (Lionel Barrymore), rather than posing as a vampire himself in a dual role, hires a troupe of talented thespians to stage an elaborate hoax to deceive the murder suspect Baron Otto von Zinden (Jean Hersholt). Bela Lugosi was enlisted to play the lead vampire in the troupe, Count Moro.\nAs a direct descendant of Browning's carnival-themed films, Browning offers the movie audience a generous dose of Gothic iconography: \"hypnotic trances, flapping bats, spooky graveyards, moaning organs, cobwebs thick as curtains \u2013 and bound it all together with bits of obscure Eastern European folklore...\"\nAs such, \"Mark of the Vampire\" leads the audience to suspend disbelief in their skepticism regarding vampires through a series of staged illusions, only to sharply disabuse them of their credulity in the final minutes of the movie. Browning reportedly composed the conventional plot scenes as he would a stage production, but softened the static impression through the editing process. In scenes that depicted the supernatural, Browning freely used a moving camera. Film historian Matthew Sweney observes \"the [special] effects shots...overpower the static shots in which the film's plot and denouement take place...creating a visual tension in the film.\"\nCinematographer James Wong Howe's lighting methods endowed the film with a spectral quality that complimented Browning's \"sense of the unreal\".\nCritic Stuart Rosenthal writes:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"The delicate, silkily evil texture [that characterizes the imagery] is as much a triumph for James Wong Howe's lighting as it is for Browning's sense of the unreal. Howe has bathed his sets in the luminous glow which is free of the harsh shadows and contrasts that mark Freund's work in Dracula.\"\n\"Mark of the Vampire\" is widely cited for its famous \"tracking shot on the stairwell\" in which Count Mora (Bela Lugosi) and his daughter Luna (Carol Borland) descend in a stately promenade. Browning inter-cuts their progress with images of vermin and venomous insects, visual equivalents for the vampires as they emerge from their own crypts in search of sustenance. Rosenthal describes the one-minute sequence:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"...Bela Lugosi and the bat-girl [Carol Borland] descend the cobweb-covered staircase of the abandoned mansion, their progress broken into a series of shots, each of which involves continuous movement of either the camera, the players, or both. This creates the impression of a steady, unearthly gliding motion...the glimpses of bats, rats and insects accent the steady, deliberate progress of the horrific pair\u2026the effect is disorienting and the viewer becomes ill-at-ease because he is entirely outside his realm of natural experience.\"\nIn another notable and \"exquisitely edited\" scene Browning presents a lesbian-inspired seduction. Count Mora, in the form of a bat, summons Luna to the cemetery where Irene Borotyn (Elizabeth Allan) (daughter of murder victim Sir Karell, awaits in a trance.) When vampire Luna avidly embraces her victim, Count Moro voyeuristically looks on approvingly. Borland's Luna would inspire the character Morticia in the TV series \"The Addams Family\".\nThe soundtrack for \"Mark of the Vampire\" is notable in that it employs no orchestral music aside from accompanying the opening and closing credits. Melodic passages, when heard, are provided only by the players. The sound effects provided by recording director Douglas Shearer contribute significantly to the film's ambiance.\nFilm historian Matthew Sweney writes:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"The only incidental music...consisting as it does with groans and nocturnal animal sounds is perhaps minimalistic, but it is not used minimally, occurring throughout film expressly to score the vampire scenes...frightning scenes are not punctuated with orchestral crescendos, but by babies crying, women screaming, horses neighing, bells striking.\"\nThe climatic \"coup-de-grace\" occurs when the murderer's incredulity regarding the existence of vampires is reversed when Browning cinematically creates an astonishing illusion of the winged Luna in flight transforming into a human. The rationalist Baron Otto, a witness to this legerdemain, is converted into a believer in the supernatural and ultimately confesses, under hypnosis, to the murder of his brother Sir Karell.\nIn the final five minutes of \"Mark of the Vampire\", the theatre audience is confronted with the \"theatrical trap\" that Browning has laid throughout the picture: none of the supernatural elements of film are genuine\u2014the \"vampires\" are merely actors engaged in a deception. This is made explicit when Bela Lugosi, no longer in character as Count Moro, declares to a fellow actor: \"Did you see me? I was greater than any real vampire!\"\n\"The Devil-Doll\" (1936).\nBrowning created a work reminiscent of his collaborations with actor Lon Chaney in the \"bizarre melodrama\" \"The Devil-Doll\".\nBased on the novel \"Burn, Witch, Burn\" (1932) by Abraham Merritt, the script was crafted by Browning with contributions from Garrett Fort, Guy Endore and Erich von Stroheim (director of \"Greed\" (1924) and \"Foolish Wives\" (1922)), and \"although it has its horrific moments, like \"Freaks\" (1932), \"The Devil-Doll\" is not a horror film.\"\nIn \"The Devil-Doll\", Browning borrows a number of the plot devices from his 1925 The Unholy Three.\nPaul Lavond (Lionel Barrymore) has spent 17 years incarcerated at Devil's Island, framed for murder and embezzlement committed by his financial associates. He escapes from the prison with fellow inmate, the ailing Marcel (Henry B. Walthall). The terminally ill scientist divulges to Lavond his secret formula for transforming humans into miniature, animated puppets. In alliance with Marcel's widow Malita (Rafaela Ottiano), the vengeful Lavond unleashes an army of tiny living \"dolls\" to exact a terrible retribution against the three \"unholy\" bankers. Biographer Vivian Sobchack acknowledges that \"the premises on which the revenge plot rest are incredible, but the visual realization is so fascinating that we are drawn, nonetheless, into a world that seems quite credible and moving\" and reminds viewers that \"there are some rather comic scenes in the film...\"\nBarrymore's dual role as Lavond and his cross-dressing persona, the elderly Madame Mandilip, a doll shop proprietor, is strikingly similar to Lon Chaney's Professor Echo and his transvestite counterpart \"Granny\" O'Grady, a parrot shop owner in \"The Unholy Three\" (1925).\n Film critic Stuart Rosenthal notes that Browning recycling of this characterization as a plot device \"is further evidence for the interchangeability of Browning's heroes, all of whom would act identically if given the same set of circumstances.\"\nThematically, \"The Devil-Doll\" presents a version of Browning \"indirect\" sexual frustration. Here, Lavond's daughter Lorraine (Maureen O'Sullivan), ignorant of her father's identity, remains so. Stuart Rothenthal explains:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt; \"Lionel Barrymore in \"The Devil-Doll\" makes an attempt [as did Lon Chaney in \"The Road to Mandalay\" (1926) and \"West of Zanzibar\" (1928)] to protect his daughter from embarrassment and unhappiness by concealing his identity from her even after he has been cleared of embezzlement. In an ironic way, by denying himself his daughter, he is punishing himself for the crimes he committed in the course of his self-exoneration...Clearly, the most deplorable consequence [of his frameup] was not the years he spent in prison, but the alienation of his daughter's love and respect.\"\nRosenthal points out another parallel between \"The Devil-Doll\" and \"The Unholy Three\" (1925): \"Lavond's concern for his daughter and refusal to misuse his powers mark him as a good man...when his revenge is complete, like Echo [in \"The Unholy Three\"], Lavond demonstrates a highly beneficent nature.\"\nBrowning proficient use of the camera and the remarkable special effects depicting the \"miniature\" people are both disturbing and fascinating, directed with \"eerie skill.\"\nFilm historians Stefanie Diekmann and Ekkehard Kn\u00f6rer report that the only direct link between Browning's fascination with \"the grotesque, the deformed and the perverse\" and the traditions of the French Grand Guignol is actor Rafaela Ottiano who plays doll-obsessed scientist Matila. Before her supporting role in \"The Devil-Doll\", she enjoyed \"a distinguished career as a Grand Guignol performer.\"\nShortly after the completion of \"The Devil-Doll\", Irving Thalberg, Browning's mentor at MGM, died at age 37. It would be two years before his final film: \"Miracles for Sale\" (1939).\n\"Miracles for Sale\" (1939).\n\"Miracles for Sale\" (1939) was the last of Browning's 46 feature films since he began directing in 1917.\nBrowning's career had been in abeyance for two years after completing \"The Devil-Doll\" in 1936.\nIn 1939, he was tasked with adapting Clayton Rawson's locked-room mystery, \"Death from a Top Hat\" (1938).\nRobert Young appears as \"The Amazing Morgan\", a conjurer and \"purveyor of magic show equipment.\" Florence Rice plays the ingenue, Judy Barkley. In this, his cinematic \"swan song\", Browning \"revisits obsessive, familiar themes of fake spiritualism, magic acts [and] transformation through disguises...\" and, as with virtually all of Browning's explorations of the arts of illusion and the \"realms of theatrical magic\", his denoumae provides \"an impirical solution\" to the mystery murder.\n\"Miracles for Sale\" opens with a startling sequence that includes a graphic illusion depicting a \"below-the-waist mutilation.\" Film critic Stuart Rosenthal writes:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"On the sideline of a battlefield, an Oriental military officer chides a beautiful female spy for having dispatched intelligence that has led to the bombing of a schoolhouse. He orders her placed in a child's coffin ('You understand why we only have small coffins available' he sneers) with her head and feet protruding from either end, and tells his men to machine-gun the casket in half. After the grisly order has been carried out, to the [movie] viewer's amazement, it is revealed that the execution is merely a variation on the traditional 'sawing-a-woman-in-half' stunt. The illusion is being offered for sale by 'The Amazing Morgan' [Robert Young], a purveyor of magician's paraphernalia\u2026\"\nDespite this \"inspired jolt\" at the film's outset, \"Miracles for Sale\" is the most \"studio bound\" of Browning's sound oeuvre, and according to film critic Stuart Rosenhal \"the only Browning production that really looks like an MGM studio job...\"\n\"Miracles for Sale\" lost money at the box-office, returning only $39,000 to MGM on a $297,000 investment. Critical evaluation was generally positive.\nBy the early 1940s, Browning's macabre sensibilities were no longer welcome in a Hollywood that was striving for \"glamour and prestige.\" Browning was summarily terminated at MGM by producer Carey Wilson after the release of Miracles for Sale and was, by the director's own account \"blackballed\" from Hollywood as a filmmaker. Stephanie Diekmann and Ekkehard Kn\u00f6rer offer this assessment of Browning's final cinematic effort:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt; \"Browning's post-\"Freaks\" films were themselves close to parodies of what had made him one of the great directors of the 1920s. The one exception is his marvelous swan song, Miracles for Sale, which in the farcical form of screwball comedy conjures up a world of traps and sleights-of-hand, of crookery and trickery \u2014 in short, the world of Tod Browning's theatre, one last time. His is a career that ended neither with a bang nor a whisper, but a performance that makes fun of an audience that believes what it sees.\"\nFilm historian Alfred Eaker adds that \"the entire structure of \"Miracles for Sale\" is an illusion itself, making it a sublime curtain call for the director...\"\nBrowning occasionally offered screenplays to MGM, but eventually disengaged entirely from the film industry and in 1942 retired to his home in Malibu, California.\nFinal years and death.\nBrowning's wife Alice died in 1944 from complications from pneumonia, leaving him a recluse at his Malibu Beach retreat. By that time Browning had become so isolated from the Hollywood establishment that \"Variety\" mistakenly published an obituary that year for Browning, confusing his spouse's death for that of the former director.\nIn 1949, the Directors Guild of America bestowed a life membership on Browning; at the time of his death, the honor had been enjoyed by only four of Browning's colleagues.\nBrowning, now a widower, lived in isolation for almost 20 years, \"an alcoholic recluse.\" In 1962 he was diagnosed with cancer of the larynx. The surgical procedure performed to correct the condition rendered him mute.\nTod Browning died alone at his Malibu home on October 6, 1962. He is interred at Angelus-Rosedale Cemetery.\nPosthumous critical appraisal.\nVivian Sobchack wrote: \"...Browning was sometimes called the Edgar Allan Poe of the cinema' [and] much admired by the surrealists. Browning's creations were, of course, a commercial cinema as well. The films suggest a man of humor and compassion who had a dark and melancholic fascination with physical deformity and with the exotic and extraordinary, and yet who observed the oddities of life with unprejudiced objectivity and some delight. A Southerner who ran away with the circus; a former Vaudevillian and magician who traveled the world before he became a filmmaker, a [literary] aesthete and a beer drinker, above all a storyteller, Browning was both a poet and a pragmatist.\" She identifies four plots or mise-en-sc\u00e8ne in which Browning presents his themes:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;1) \"Exotic melodramas\", in which the film's physical setting generates much of the plot and action;2) \"Crook melodramas\", whose main characters are criminals (primarily thieves and swindlers);3) \"Bizarre melodramas\", on physically deformed or freakishly designed characters;4) a minor group, \"Mystery melodramas\", deal with solving a crime (usually a murder), often debunking supernatural explanations in the process.\nSobchack points out that the plot synopsis for these films, considered independently of their cinematic treatments, appear \"ludicrous\" or \"bizarre\" in conception. Browning's handling of the material, however, produce \"powerful and disturbing realizations on the screen.\"\nThe melodramas that Browning wrote and directed for MGM and Universal are formulaic manifestations of his \"compulsive\" preoccupation with themes of \"moral and sexual frustration, interchangeable guilt [and] patterns of human repulsion and attraction.\"\nAlfred Eaker found: \"Browning himself continues to be dismissed by less insightful critics, who evaluate the man and his work by contemporary entertainment standards or even accuse the great empathetic artist of exploitation. Browning's standing still remains low. Neither he, nor any of his films have received a single honor by a major film recognition or preservation institution.\"\nAccording to Stuart Rosenthal: \"Although the work of any auteur will repeatedly emphasize specific thoughts and ideas, Browning is so aggressive and unrelenting in his pursuit of certain themes that he appears to be neurotically fixated on them. He is inevitably attracted to situations of moral and sexual frustration...[w]hat sets Browning apart is his abnormal fascination with the deformed creatures who populate his films\u2014a fascination that is not always entirely intellectual, and one in which he takes extreme delight.\" Rosenthal offers this analysis of the director's style and themes:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The adjective most often applied to Browning's cinema is 'obsessional'...he expresses his obsessional content in a manner that may properly be described as compulsive. Certain shots, compositions and montages appear again and again in Browning's \"oeuvre\" [leaving] an impression of frank repetition. In fact, he has a limited catalog of themes and effects from which compiles each of his pictures. The overall scope of the entire Browning filmography is not significantly broader than any single entry in it.\nRosenthal assigns four thematic categories to Browning's films: 1) Reality vs. Appearance, in which an individual's social exterior (physical beauty, the trappings of authority or professional status) are exposed as facades masking cruel or criminal behavior. (ex. \"The Unholy Three\" (1925), \"Where East Is East\" (1929)); 2) Sexual Frustration, often involving a \"sacred\" father-child or other kinship relation in which \"a man's offspring represent extensions of his own sexuality\" provoking a protective response to sexual insults from outsiders. (ex. \"The Road to Mandalay\" (1926), \"West of Zanzibar\" (1928)).; 3)\u00a0Conflict of Opposing Tendencies within an Individual, leading to a loss of identity when irreconcilable character traits in a person produces alter egos. Author Robert Louis Stevenson's \"Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde\" explores this \"intractable frustration.\" (ex. \"Outside the Law\" (1921), \"The Blackbird\" (1926)).; and finally 4) Inability to Assign Guilt, in which a character resorts to violence or criminal acts in order to avenge injustice, and guilt or blame remains ambiguous. (ex. \"The Unknown\" (1927), \"Freaks\" (1932)) For Rosenthal, the factor that unifies all these thematic patterns is frustration: \"Frustration is Browning's dominant theme.\"\nFilmography.\nDirector.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It specializes in video games, toys, and amusement arcades. The company was founded by Ukrainian businessman Michael Kogan in 1953 as the importing vodka, vending machines, and jukeboxes into Japan. It began production of video games in 1973. In 2005, Taito was purchased by Square Enix, becoming a wholly owned subsidiary by 2006.\nTaito is recognized as an important industry influencer in the early days of video games, producing a number of hit arcade games such as \"Speed Race\" (1974), \"Western Gun\" (1975), \"Space Invaders\" (1978), \"Bubble Bobble\" (1986), and \"Arkanoid\" (1986). It is one of the most prominent video game companies from Japan and the first that exported its games to other countries. Several of its games have since been recognized as important and revolutionary for the industry \u2013 \"Space Invaders\" in particular was a major contributor to the growth of video games in the late 1970s, and the aliens featured in the games are seen as iconic emblems within the video game industry.\nThe company maintains a chain of arcade centers, known as \"Taito Game Stations\", across Japan, alongside being a manufacturer of toys, plush dolls and UFO-catcher prizes.\nHistory.\nIn 1944, Jewish Ukrainian businessman Michael Kogan founded Taitung in Shanghai. Kogan, a refugee of the Soviet Union, had previously worked in a factory in Japan during the country's involvement in World War II before moving to Shanghai to join his father. The company's name, written in Chinese as \u592a\u6771 (Pinyin: \"t\u00e0id\u014dng\", Japanese reading: \"tait\u014d\"), is composed of the characters \u592a from \u7336\u592a\n(\"Judea\") and \u6771, meaning \"East\", ostensibly alluding to his position as a Jew in the Far East diaspora. Taitung dealt in floor coverings, natural hair wigs, and hog bristles.\n1950s\u20131960s.\nThe Communist takeover of China prompted Kogan to liquidate the business in 1950 and move operations to Japan, which had been suffering a significant economic decline after the war. The second business, a clothing distributor named Taito Yoko, struggled financially as a result of employee carelessness and constant loss of products. On August 24, 1953, Taito Yoko was abolished and replaced by the Taito Trading Company, where Kogan was joined by lawyer and retired newspaperman Akio Nakatani. Taito Trading Company began as a vodka distillery\u2014the first company to produce vodka in Japan\u2014and an importer of peanut vending machines and perfume machines.\nIncreasing competition led to Taito abandoning the vodka business in 1955 and focusing on its successful vending machines, in addition to importing jukeboxes. As Taito lacked a proper license to import jukeboxes into Japan, it purchased broken-down machines from United States military bases and refurbished them with working parts from defective units. The recovering Japanese economy allowed Taito to become the official distributor of AMI jukeboxes in the country. Though the deal had little impact at first, over 1,500 machines were sold by 1960 when the company began mixing Japanese records with American folk songs. A partnership with the Seeburg Corporation made Taito its exclusive agent in Japan and one of the nation's leading jukebox companies.\nTaito began manufacturing electro-mechanical games (EM games) in the 1960s. In 1967, they released \"Crown Soccer Special\" (1967), a two-player sports game that simulated association football using electronic components such as pinball flippers. In 1968, \"Crown Basketball\" debuted in the US as the highest-earning arcade game at the 1968 Tampa Fair.\n1970s\u20131980s.\nTaito changed its name from Taito Trading Company to Taito Corporation in August 1972. It established its American subsidiary in 1973 in downtown Chicago, Taito America.\nFirst video game.\nTaito's first video game was called \"Elepong\". It is a ping-pong arcade cabinet released in 1973 in Japan.\nTomohiro Nishikado, a Tokyo Denki University engineering graduate who joined the company in 1968, was instrumental in the company's transition to video games. After developing the hit electro-mechanical target shooting games \"Sky Fighter\" (1971) and \"Sky Fighter II\", his bosses at Taito believed transistor-transistor logic (TTL) technology would play a significant role in the arcade industry, so they tasked Nishikado with investigating TTL technology as he was the company's only employee who knew how to work with integrated circuit (IC) technology, and one of the few engineers at any Japanese coin-op company with significant expertise in solid-state electronics.\nNishikado spent six months dissecting Atari's \"Pong\" arcade unit and learning how the game's IC chips worked, and began modifying the game. This led to his development of the \"Pong\"-style sports video games \"Soccer\" and \"Davis Cup\" for Taito, with \"Soccer\" developed first but both released in November 1973. He then developed several original arcade video game hits for Taito, notably the sports game \"TV Basketball\" (1974), the racing game \"Speed Race\" (1974), and the shooter game \"Western Gun\" (1975); these three titles were localized by Midway Manufacturing in North America as \"TV Basketball\", \"Wheels\", and \"Gun Fight\", respectively.\nIn 1978, Nishikado created \"Space Invaders\", which became the company's most popular title and one of the most popular games in arcade history, partially responsible for beginning the golden age of arcade video games. After Michael Kogan died in February 1984, his son, Abraham \"Abba\" Kogan, became Taito's chairman and Akio Nakanishi became its president.\nIn April 1986 and barely a month after becoming part of the Kyocera group, Taito merged with two of its subsidiaries, Pacific Industrial Co., Ltd. and the Japan Vending Machine Co., Ltd, and absorbed them both. Japan Vending Machine was once an independent company but was purchased by Taito in July 1971 to strengthen its presence in the operation of amusement facilities. Pacific Industrial was created by Taito itself in 1963 to develop products for the company.\n1990s\u20132000s.\nIn 1992, Taito announced a CD-ROM-based video game console named WOWOW, that would have allowed people to play near-exact ports of Taito's arcades (similar to the Neo Geo), as well as download games from a satellite transmission (as the Satellaview would do later). It was named after the Japanese television station WOWOW and would have utilized its stations to download games. The WOWOW was never released.\nTaito America ceased operations in July 1996 after more than 20 years of existence. Taito had already sold exclusive rights for publishing its games in America to Acclaim Entertainment the previous year. Similarly, a division existed in London, England, United Kingdom to distribute Taito games in Europe. Taito (Europe) Corporation Limited was created in 1988 and liquidated in February 1998.\nWhen Taito was owned by Kyocera, its headquarters were in Hirakawach\u014d, Chiyoda. In October 2000, Taito merged with Kyocera Multimedia Corporation to enter the market of mobile phones for the first time.\nIn August 2005, it was announced that the gaming conglomerate Square Enix would purchase 247,900 Taito shares worth \u00a545.16 billion (US$409.1 million), to make Taito Corporation a subsidiary of Square Enix. The purpose of the takeover by Square Enix was to both increase Taito's profit margin exponentially as well as begin its company's expansion into new forms of gaming, most notably, the arcade scene, and various other entertainment venues. The takeover bid from Square Enix was accepted by previous stockholder Kyocera, making Taito a Square Enix subsidiary. \nOn September 22, 2005, Square Enix announced successfully acquiring 93.7% of all shares of Taito, effectively owning the company by September 28, 2005. In March 2006, Square Enix wanted to make Taito a wholly owned subsidiary. To accomplish this goal, Square Enix merged Taito into SQEX Corporation. Although the combined company took on the name \"Taito Corporation\", it was actually Taito that was dissolved and SQEX that was the surviving entity. Taito became a subsidiary wholly owned by Square Enix and was delisted from the First Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange.\nIn July 2008, Square Enix announced that it would liquidate two subsidiaries of Taito, Taito Art Corporation (an insurance and travel agent subsidiary) and Taito Tech Co., Ltd. (an amusement and maintenance subsidiary) on the grounds that both had fulfilled their business purpose. The process ended in October 2008.\n2010s\u2013present.\nIn February 2010, Taito's unit for home video games split into a separate company called Taito Soft Corporation (not to be confused with Taito Software, the North American division of the late 1980s). On March 11, 2010, Taito Soft was folded into Square Enix. All of Taito's franchises for video game consoles in Japan are since published by Square Enix.\nSquare Enix Holdings wanted all of its arcade operations to be regrouped into one subsidiary. The third and present Taito Corporation came to being on February 1, 2010, by merging the second company (formerly SQEX/Game Designers Studio) with ES1 Corporation. In an \"absorption-type company split\" move, the second company was split and renamed Taito Soft Corporation, while ES1 Corporation became the third Taito Corporation.\nDuring its merger with the second company to become itself the new Taito Corporation, ES1 inherited all of Taito's arcade and mobile businesses, and nearly the totality of its employees. On the other hand, Taito Soft Corporation (formerly SQEX) was left with 10 employees to concentrate exclusively on the development and publishing of video games for home consoles. Taito Soft Corporation was eventually merged into Square Enix in March 2010 and dissolved. ES1 Corporation was established on June 1, 2009, as an operator of arcade facilities. ES1 Corporation was owned by the shell company SPC1, itself a wholly owned subsidiary of Square Enix Holdings. SCP1 dissolved when ES1 became Taito Corporation in February 2010. As such, the current Taito Corporation is technically the company formerly called ES1 Corporation.\nOn November 30, 2016, Taito announced that it will distribute \"Space Invaders\" and \"Arkanoid\" for Facebook with Instant Games on Facebook Messenger and Facebook News Feed.\nOn July 3, 2018, Taito announced in Famitsu that it will return to the software publishing business for the eighth generation of video game consoles. The intention to return to the home console market came about because the company decided that it would be necessary to release Taito's intellectual properties on current platforms in order to increase profit. The company has various properties planned in its software pipeline, from re-releases to new titles for various platforms; however, Taito highlighted that the console software market is a challenging business for the company. Taito intends to develop original games for consoles in the future.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "31509", "revid": "35936988", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31509", "title": "Hulk", "text": "Marvel Comics Character\nThe Hulk is a superhero appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Created by writer Stan Lee and artist Jack Kirby, the character first appeared in the debut issue of \"The Incredible Hulk\" (May 1962). In his comic book appearances, the character, who has dissociative identity disorder (DID), is primarily represented by the alter ego Hulk, an immense, green-skinned, hulking brute, possessing a limitless degree of physical strength, and the alter ego Dr. Robert Bruce Banner, a physically weak, socially withdrawn, and emotionally reserved physicist, both of whom typically resent each other. Lee stated that the Hulk's creation was inspired by a combination of \"Frankenstein\" and \"Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde\". \nFollowing his accidental exposure to gamma rays while saving the life of Rick Jones during the detonation of an experimental bomb, Banner is physically transformed into the Hulk when subjected to emotional stress, at or against his will. This transformation often leads to destructive rampages and conflicts that complicate Banner's civilian life. The Hulk's level of strength is usually conveyed proportionate to his anger level. Commonly portrayed as a raging savage, the Hulk has been represented with other alter egos like a gangster (Joe Fixit), a merged personality (Merged Hulk), a mindless, destructive force (War), a brilliant warrior (World-Breaker), a self-hating protector (Devil Hulk), a genius scientist in his own right (Doc Green), and several minor alter egos.\nDespite Hulk and Banner's desire for solitude, the character has a large supporting cast. This includes Banner's love interest Betty Ross, his best friend, Rick Jones, his cousin She-Hulk, and therapist and ally Doc Samson. In addition, the Hulk alter ego has many key supporting characters, like his co-founders of the superhero team the Avengers, his queen Caiera, fellow warriors Korg and Miek, and sons Skaar and Hiro-Kala. However, his uncontrollable power has brought him into conflict with his fellow heroes and others such as General Thunderbolt Ross, Betty's father. Despite this, he tries his best to do what's right while battling villains such as the Leader, the Abomination, the Absorbing Man, and more.\nOne of the most iconic characters in popular culture, the character has appeared on a variety of merchandise, such as clothing and collectable items that was inspired by real-world structures (such as theme park attractions), and been referenced in several media. Banner and the Hulk have been adapted into live-action, animated, and video game incarnations. The character was first played in live-action by Bill Bixby and Lou Ferrigno in the 1978 television series \"The Incredible Hulk\" and its subsequent television films \"The Incredible Hulk Returns\" (1988), \"The Trial of the Incredible Hulk\" (1989), and \"The Death of the Incredible Hulk\" (1990). In the 2003 film \"Hulk\", the character was played by Eric Bana. In the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), the character was first portrayed by Edward Norton in the film \"The Incredible Hulk\" (2008) and then by Mark Ruffalo in later appearances in the franchise.\nPublication history.\nConcept and creation.\nThe Hulk first appeared in \"The Incredible Hulk\" #1 (cover dated May 1962), written by writer-editor Stan Lee, penciled and co-plotted by Jack Kirby, and inked by Paul Reinman. Lee cites influence from \"Frankenstein\" and \"Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde\" in the Hulk's creation:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;It was patently apparent that [the monstrous character the] Thing was the most popular character in [Marvel's recently created superhero team the] Fantastic Four. ... For a long time, I'd been aware of the fact that people were more likely to favor someone who was less than perfect. ... It's a safe bet that you remember Quasimodo, but how easily can you name any of the heroic, handsomer, more glamorous characters in \"The Hunchback of Notre Dame\"? And then there's Frankenstein ... I've always had a soft spot in my heart for the Frankenstein monster. No one could ever convince me that he was the bad guy. ... He never wanted to hurt anyone; he merely groped his torturous way through a second life trying to defend himself, trying to come to terms with those who sought to destroy him. ... I decided I might as well borrow from Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde as well\u2014our protagonist would constantly change from his normal identity to his superhuman alter ego and back again.\nKirby also stated the Frankenstein inspiration stating, \"I did a story called \"The Hulk\"\u2013 a small feature, and it was quite different from the Hulk that we know. But I felt that the Hulk had possibilities, and I took this little character from the small feature and I transformed it into the Hulk that we know today.\nOf course, I was experimenting with it. I thought the Hulk might be a good-looking Frankenstein. I felt there's a Frankenstein in all of us; I\u2019ve seen it demonstrated. And I felt that the Hulk had the element of truth in it, and anything to me with the element of truth is valid and the reader relates to that. And if you dramatize it, the reader will enjoy it.\" Kirby also commented upon his influences in drawing the character, and recalled the inspiration of witnessing the hysterical strength of a mother lifting a car off her trapped child.\nLee has also compared Hulk to the golem of Jewish mythology. In \"The Science of Superheroes\", Gresh and Weinberg see the Hulk as a reaction to the Cold War and the threat of nuclear attack, an interpretation shared by Weinstein in \"Up, Up and Oy Vey\". This interpretation corresponds with other popularized fictional media created during this time period, which took advantage of the prevailing sense among Americans that nuclear power could produce monsters and mutants.\nIn the debut, Lee chose gray for the Hulk because he wanted a color that did not suggest any particular ethnic group. Colorist Stan Goldberg, however, had problems with the gray coloring, resulting in different shades of gray, and even green, in the issue. After seeing the first published issue, Lee chose to change the skin color to green. Green was used in retellings of the origin, with even reprints of the original story being recolored for the next two decades, until \"The Incredible Hulk\" vol. 2, #302 (December 1984) reintroduced the gray Hulk in flashbacks set close to the origin story. An exception is the early trade paperback, \"Origins of Marvel Comics\", from 1974, which explains the difficulties in keeping the gray color consistent in a Stan Lee-written prologue, and reprints the origin story keeping the gray coloration. Since December 1984, reprints of the first issue have displayed the original gray coloring, with the fictional canon specifying that the Hulk's skin had initially been gray.\nLee gave the Hulk's alter ego the alliterative name \"Bruce Banner\" because he found he had less difficulty remembering alliterative names. Despite this, in later stories he misremembered the character's name and referred to him as \"Bob Banner\", an error which readers quickly picked up on. The discrepancy was resolved by giving the character the official full name \"Robert Bruce Banner\".\nThe Hulk got his name from a comic book character named The Heap who was a large green swamp monster.\nSeries history.\nThe Hulk's original series was canceled with issue #6 (March 1963). Lee had written each story, with Kirby penciling the first five issues and Steve Ditko penciling and inking the sixth. The character immediately guest-starred in \"The Fantastic Four\" #12 (March 1963), and months later became a founding member of the superhero team the Avengers, appearing in the first two issues of the team's eponymous series (Sept. and Nov. 1963), and returning as an antagonist in issue #3 and as an ally in #5 (Jan.\u2013May 1964). He then guest-starred in \"Fantastic Four\" #25\u201326 (April\u2013May 1964), which revealed Banner's full name as Robert Bruce Banner, and \"The Amazing Spider-Man\" #14 (July 1964).\nAround this time, co-creator Kirby received a letter from a college dormitory stating the Hulk had been chosen as its official mascot. Kirby and Lee realized their character had found an audience in college-age readers.\nA year and a half after \"The Incredible Hulk\" was canceled, the Hulk became one of two features in \"Tales to Astonish\", beginning in issue #60 (Oct. 1964).\nThis new Hulk feature was initially scripted by Lee, with pencils by Steve Ditko and inks by George Roussos. Other artists later in this run included Jack Kirby (#68\u201387, June 1965\u00a0\u2013 Oct. 1966); Gil Kane (credited as \"Scott Edwards\", #76, (Feb. 1966)); Bill Everett (#78\u201384, April\u2013Oct. 1966); John Buscema (#85\u201387); and Marie Severin. The \"Tales to Astonish\" run introduced the super-villains the Leader, who would become the Hulk's nemesis, and the Abomination, another gamma-irradiated being. Marie Severin finished out the Hulk's run in \"Tales to Astonish\". Beginning with issue #102 (April 1968) the book was retitled \"The Incredible Hulk\" vol. 2, and ran until 1999, when Marvel canceled the series and launched \"Hulk\" #1. Marvel filed for a trademark for \"The Incredible Hulk\" in 1967, and the United States Patent and Trademark Office issued the registration in 1970.\nLen Wein wrote the series from 1974 through 1978, working first with Herb Trimpe, then, as of issue #194 (December 1975), with Sal Buscema, who was the regular artist for ten years. Issues #180\u2013181 (Oct.\u2013Nov. 1974) introduced Wolverine as an antagonist, who would go on to become one of Marvel Comics' most popular characters. In 1977, Marvel launched a second title, \"The Rampaging Hulk\", a black-and-white comics magazine. This was originally conceived as a flashback series, set between the end of his original, short-lived solo title and the beginning of his feature in \"Tales to Astonish\". After nine issues, the magazine was retitled \"The Hulk!\" and printed in color.\nIn 1977, two Hulk television films were aired to strong ratings, leading to an \"Incredible Hulk\" TV series that aired from 1978 to 1982. A huge ratings success, the series introduced the popular Hulk catchphrase \"Don't make me angry. You wouldn't like me when I'm angry\", and broadened the character's popularity from a niche comic book readership into the mainstream consciousness.\nBill Mantlo became the series' writer for five years beginning with issue #245 (March 1980). Mantlo's \"Crossroads of Eternity\" stories (#300\u2013313 (Oct. 1984\u00a0\u2013 Nov. 1985)) explored the idea that Banner had suffered child abuse. Later Hulk writers Peter David and Greg Pak have called these stories an influence on their approaches to the character. Mantlo left the series for \"Alpha Flight\" and that series' writer John Byrne took over \"The Incredible Hulk\". The final issue of Byrne's six issue run featured the wedding of Bruce Banner and Betty Ross. Writer Peter David began a 12-year run with issue #331 (May 1987). He returned to the Roger Stern and Mantlo abuse storylines, expanding the damage caused, and depicting Banner as suffering dissociative identity disorder (DID).\nIn 1998, David killed off Banner's long-time love Betty Ross. Marvel executives used Ross' death as an opportunity to pursue the return of the Savage Hulk. David disagreed, leading to his parting ways with Marvel. Also in 1998, Marvel relaunched \"The Rampaging Hulk\" as a standard comic book rather than as a comics magazine. \"The Incredible Hulk\" was again cancelled with issue #474 of its second volume in March 1999 and was replaced with a new series, \"Hulk\" the following month, with returning writer Byrne and art by Ron Garney. New series writer Paul Jenkins developed the Hulk's multiple dissociative identities, and his run was followed by Bruce Jones with his run featuring Banner being pursued by a secret conspiracy and aided by the mysterious Mr. Blue. Jones appended his 43-issue \"Incredible Hulk\" run with the limited series \"Hulk/Thing: Hard Knocks\" #1\u20134 (Nov. 2004\u00a0\u2013 Feb. 2005), which Marvel published after putting the ongoing series on hiatus. Peter David, who had initially signed a contract for the six-issue \"Tempest Fugit\" limited series, returned as writer when it was decided to make that story the first five parts of the revived (vol. 3). After a four-part tie-in to the \"House of M\" storyline and a one-issue epilogue, David left the series once more, citing the need to do non-Hulk work for the sake of his career.\nWriter Greg Pak took over the series in 2006, leading the Hulk through several crossover storylines including \"Planet Hulk\" and \"World War Hulk\", which left the Hulk temporarily incapacitated and replaced as the series' title character by the demigod Hercules in the retitled \"The Incredible Hercules\" (Feb. 2008). The Hulk returned periodically in \"Hulk\", which then starred the new Red Hulk. In September 2009, \"The Incredible Hulk\" was relaunched as \"The Incredible Hulk\" (vol. 2) #600. The series was retitled \"The Incredible Hulks\" with issue #612 (Nov. 2010) to encompass the Hulk's expanded family, and ran until issue #635 (Oct. 2011) when it was replaced with \"The Incredible Hulk\" (vol. 3) (15 issues, Dec. 2011\u00a0\u2013 Dec. 2012) written by Jason Aaron with art by Marc Silvestri. As part of Marvel's 2012 Marvel NOW! relaunch, a series called \"Indestructible Hulk\" (Nov. 2012) debuted under the creative team of Mark Waid and Leinil Yu. This series was replaced in 2014 with \"The Hulk\" by Waid and artist Mark Bagley.\nA new series titled \"The Immortal Hulk\", written by Al Ewing and drawn by Joe Bennett, was launched in 2018 and ran for 50 issues. The series had a spin-off one-shot \"Immortal She-Hulk\" and a spin-off series about Gamma Flight in June 2021.\nIn November 2021, Donny Cates became the new writer of \"Hulk\", with Ryan Ottley joining as artist. In May 2022, the series did a crossover with the \"Thor\" series, also written by Cates, entitled \"Hulk vs Thor: Banner of War\". The series ran for 14 issues, with Ottley taking over as writer for the last 4 issues afters Cates left the book.\nIn March 2023, it was announced that a new volume of \"The Incredible Hulk\" would launch in June 2023, written by Phillip Kennedy Johnson and drawn by Nic Klein.\nCharacterization.\nFictional character biography.\nRobert Bruce Banner's psyche was profoundly affected by his troubled childhood, in which his father, Brian Banner, regarded him as a monster due to his seemingly unnatural intellect from a young age. These experiences caused Bruce to develop a dissociative identity disorder and repress his negative emotions as a coping mechanism. After Brian killed Bruce's mother in a fit of rage, Bruce lived with several relatives up until his high school years, when his intelligence caught the attention of the United States Army. Banner was recruited to develop nuclear weapons under the authority of General Thaddeus \"Thunderbolt\" Ross, and soon developed a relationship with the General's daughter Betty Ross.\nDuring the experimental detonation of a gamma bomb, Banner saves teenager Rick Jones, who was dared onto the testing field; Banner pushes Jones into a trench to save him, but is hit with the blast, absorbing massive amounts of gamma radiation. He awakens later seemingly unscathed, but he begins transforming into a powerful and destructive creature upon nightfall, which a pursuing soldier describes as a \"hulk\". Banner's attempts to cure himself of these transformations alter their conditions, causing Banner to transform as a response to rage or fear. The Hulk is a founding member of the Avengers, but quickly leaves the group due to their distrust of him. Banner maintains the secret of his dual identity with Rick's aid, but Rick reveals his secret following his assumed death to Major Glenn Talbot who subsequently informed his superiors, forcing Banner to become a fugitive upon returning from the future where he was actually thrown to.\nPsychiatrist Doc Samson captures the Hulk and manages to physically separate Banner and the Hulk, allowing Banner to marry Betty. However, Banner and the Hulk's molecular structure destabilized and threatened to kill them, requiring Samson to reunite them with the aid of Vision. Samson is later able to merge elements of Banner's fractured psyche to create Professor Hulk, an intelligent but egocentric variation of the Hulk. Professor Hulk soon becomes a key member of the Pantheon, a secretive organization of superpowered individuals. His tenure with the organization brings him into conflict with a tyrannical alternate future version of himself called the Maestro, who rules over a world where many heroes are dead. The Professor Hulk construct ultimately proves unstable, and Banner's psyche eventually splinters once more.\nIn \"Planet Hulk\", the Illuminati decide the Hulk is too dangerous to remain on Earth and send him away by rocket ship which crashes on the planet Sakaar. The Hulk finds allies in the Warbound and marries alien queen Caiera, a relationship that bears him two sons: Skaar and Hiro-Kala. After the Illuminati's ship explodes and kills Caiera, the Hulk returns to Earth with the Warbound and declares war on the planet in \"World War Hulk\". However, after learning that Miek, one of the Warbound, had actually been responsible for the destruction, the Hulk allows himself to be defeated, with Banner subsequently redeeming himself as a hero as he works with and against the new Red Hulk to defeat the new supervillain team the Intelligencia.\nLater, the Hulk turns to Doctor Doom to separate himself and Banner, with Doom surgically extracting the elements of the Hulk's brain uniquely belonging to Banner and inserting them into a clone body. Banner eventually re-combines with the Hulk when his cloned body is destroyed in an attempt to recreate his original transformation. Following this, Bruce willingly joins the spy organization S.H.I.E.L.D., allowing them to use the Hulk as a weapon in exchange for providing him with the means and funding to create a lasting legacy for himself. When Banner is shot in the head by an assassin, Tony Stark saves him with a variant of the Extremis virus. This procedure creates a new intelligent persona named Doc Green, who concludes that the world is in danger by Gamma Mutates and thus need to be depowered. He creates a cure and removes the powers of A-Bomb (Rick Jones), Skaar, and Red Hulk. Eventually, Doc Green's intellect fades and his normal Hulk form is restored.\nWhen the vision of the Inhuman Ulysses Cain shows a rampaging Hulk standing over the corpses of many superheroes, Banner gives Hawkeye special arrows capable of killing him during a transformation, which Hawkeye accomplishes. The Hulk was first revived by the Hand, then by Hydra, and finally by the Challenger for a contest against the Grandmaster.\nPersonality.\nLike other long-lived characters, the Hulk's character and cultural interpretations have changed with time, adding or modifying character traits. The Hulk is typically seen as an immense, green skin hulking brute with larger jaws, exaggerated brows, black hair like Bruce's (but wilder and messy), a lower voice, and intense eyes, wearing only a pair of torn pants that survive his physical transformation as the character progressed. As Bruce Banner, the character is about 5\u00a0ft 9 in (1.75 m) tall and weighs 128\u00a0lbs (58.05\u00a0kg), but when transformed into the Hulk, the character stands between 7 and 8\u00a0ft (2.13 - 2.43 m) tall and weighs between 1,040 and 1,400\u00a0lbs (471.73 - 635.02\u00a0kg). The Gray Hulk stands 6\u00a0ft 6 in (1.98 m) tall and weighs 900\u00a0lbs (408.23\u00a0kg); the Merged Hulk stands 7\u00a0ft 6 in (2.28 m) tall and weighs 1,150\u00a0lbs (521.63\u00a0kg); the Green Scar stands 8\u00a0ft 8 in (2.64 m) tall and weighs 2,400\u00a0lbs (1.08 ton). The Devil Hulk is roughly the same size as Sasquatch, standing around 9 or 10\u00a0ft (2.74 / 3.04 m) tall and weighing roughly 2,000\u00a0lbs (907.18\u00a0kg). Following his debut, Banner's transformations were triggered at nightfall, turning him into a gray-skinned Hulk. In \"Incredible Hulk\" #2, the Hulk started to appear with green skin, and in \"Avengers\" #3 (1963) Banner realized that his transformations were now triggered by surges of adrenaline in response to feelings of fear, pain or anger. \"Incredible Hulk\" #227 (1978) established that the Hulk's separate identity was not due to the mutation affecting his brain, but because Banner was suffering from dissociative identity disorder, with the savage Green Hulk representing Banner's repressed childhood rage and aggression, and the Gray Hulk representing Banner's repressed selfish desires and urges.\nIdentities.\nBruce Banner.\nDuring his decades of publication, Banner has been portrayed differently, but common themes persist. Banner, a physicist who earned his Ph.D. in nuclear physics from the California Institute of Technology (Caltech), is sarcastic and seemingly very self-assured when he first appears in \"Incredible Hulk\" #1, but is also emotionally withdrawn. Banner designed the gamma bomb that caused his affliction, and the ironic twist of his self-inflicted fate has been one of the most persistent common themes. Arie Kaplan describes the character thus: \"Robert Bruce Banner lives in a constant state of panic, always wary that the monster inside him will erupt, and therefore he cannot form meaningful bonds with anyone.\" As a child, Banner's father Brian often got mad and physically abused both Banner and his mother, creating the psychological complex of fear, anger, and the fear of anger and the destruction it can cause that underlies the character. Banner has been shown to be emotionally repressed, but capable of deep love for Betty Ross and solving problems posed to him. Under the writing of Paul Jenkins, Banner was shown to be a capable fugitive, applying deductive reasoning and observation to figure out the events transpiring around him. On the occasions that Banner controlled the Hulk's body, he applied principles of physics to problems and challenges and used deductive reasoning. It was shown after his ability to turn into the Hulk was taken away by the red Hulk that Banner has been extremely versatile as well as cunning when dealing with the many situations that followed. When he was briefly separated from the Hulk by Doom, Banner became criminally insane, driven by his desire to regain the power of the Hulk, but once the two recombined he came to accept that he was a better person with the Hulk to provide something for him to focus on controlling rather than allowing his intellect to run without restraint against the world.\nHulk.\nThe traditional Hulk, often called \"Savage Hulk\", was originally shown as gray and average in intelligence. He roamed aimlessly and became annoyed at \"puny\" humans who took him for a dangerous monster. Shortly after becoming the Hulk, his transformation continued turning him green, coinciding with him beginning to display primitive speech. By \"Incredible Hulk\" #4, radiation treatments gave Banner's mind complete control of the Hulk's body. While Banner relished his indestructibility and power, he was quick to anger and more aggressive in his Hulk form. He became known as a hero alongside the Avengers, but his increasing paranoia caused him to leave the group. He was convinced that he would never be trusted.\nOriginally, the Hulk was shown as simple-minded and quick to anger. The Hulk generally divorces his identity from Banner's, decrying Banner as \"puny Banner.\" From his earliest stories, the Hulk has been concerned with finding sanctuary and quiet. He is often shown to quickly react emotionally to situations. Grest and Weinberg call Hulk the \"dark, primordial side of Banner's psyche.\" Even in the earliest appearances, Hulk spoke in the third person. Hulk retains a modest intelligence, thinking and talking in full sentences. Lee even gives the Hulk expository dialogue in issue #6, allowing readers to learn just what capabilities Hulk has, when the Hulk says, \"But these muscles ain't just for show! All I gotta do is spring up and just keep goin'!\" In the 1970s, Hulk was shown as more prone to anger and rage, and less talkative. Writers played with the nature of his transformations, briefly giving Banner control over the change, and the ability to maintain control of his Hulk form. Artistically and conceptually, the character has become progressively more muscular and powerful in the years since his debut.\nJoe Fixit.\nOriginally, Stan Lee wanted the Hulk to be gray. Due to ink problems, Hulk's color was changed to green. This was later changed in the story to indicate that the Gray Hulk and the Savage Hulk are separate dissociative identities or entities fighting for control in Bruce's subconscious. The Gray Hulk incarnation can do the more unscrupulous things that Banner could not bring himself to do, with many sources comparing the Gray Hulk to the moody teenager that Banner never allowed himself to be. While the Gray Hulk still had the-madder-he-gets, the-stronger-he-gets part that is similar to the Savage Hulk, it is on a much slower rate. It is said by the Leader that the Gray Hulk is stronger on nights of the new moon and weaker on nights of the full moon. Originally, the night is when Bruce Banner became the Gray Hulk and changed back by dawn. In later comics, willpower or stress would have Banner turn into the Gray Hulk. During one storyline where he was placed under a spell to prevent him turning back into Bruce Banner and publicly presumed dead when he was teleported away from a gamma bomb explosion that destroyed an entire town, the Gray Hulk adopted a specific name as Joe Fixit, a security expert for Las Vegas casino owner Michael Berengetti, with the Gray Hulk often being referred to as Joe after these events. Joe Fixit later gained the ability to transform into a version of Red Hulk in the Below-Place.\nMerged Hulk.\nConvinced that unaided, the Banner, Green Hulk, and Gray Hulk identities would eventually destroy each other, Doc Samson uses hypnosis to merge the three to create a new single identity combining Banner's intelligence with the Gray Hulk's and Banner's attitudes and the Green Hulk's body. This new Merged Hulk, Professor Hulk, or simply Smart Hulk, considered himself cured and began a new life, but the merger was not perfect, and the Hulk sometimes still considered Banner a separate person, and when overcome with rage the Merged Hulk would transform back into Banner's human body while still thinking himself the Hulk. The Merged Hulk is the largest of the three primary Hulk incarnations. While in a calm emotional state, the Merged Hulk is stronger than Savage Hulk when he is calm. Unlike the Savage Hulk and the Gray Hulk, Banner subconsciously installed a type of safeguard within this incarnation. The safeguard is that when the Merged Hulk gets angry, he regresses back to Banner with the mind of the Savage Hulk.\nDoc Green.\nA variation of the Merged Hulk identity takes on the name Doc Green as the result of Extremis fixing Hulk's brain, becoming powerful enough to destroy Tony Stark's mansion with one thunderclap. This form was also known as Omega Hulk. It was theorized by Doc Green that this form was an earlier incarnation of his possible future form Maestro.\nThe Devil Hulk.\nThe Devil Hulk, or simply the Devil, is the result of the Hulk needing a father figure. While the character's physical appearance varies, he is always depicted as having glowing red eyes and reptilian traits. The new form of the Devil Hulk is the result of Banner and Hulk having been through different deaths and rebirths. This incarnation is articulate, smart, and cunning, and does merciless attacks on those who do harm. Unlike the other Hulk incarnations, the Devil Hulk is content with waiting inside Bruce. If Bruce is injured by sunset, the Devil Hulk will emerge with his transformation being limited to night-time. Thanks to the Devil Hulk side and Banner working together, the Devil Hulk can maintain his form in sunlight.\nOther identities.\nThe Gravage Hulk is the result of Banner using the Gamma Projector on himself, fusing his Savage Hulk and Gray Hulk identities. This form possesses the raw power of the Savage Hulk and the cunning intellect of the Gray Hulk. While he does not draw on anger to empower him, the Gravage Hulk identity draws on dimensional nexus energies to increase his strength.\nThe Dark Hulk identity is the result of Hulk being possessed by Shanzar. This form has black skin and is viciously strong.\nThe Guilt Hulk is a malevolent representation of Banner's abusive father, Brian Banner, that manifests itself in Banner's childhood memories. Created by writer Peter David and artist Dale Keown, the character first appeared in \"The Incredible Hulk\" vol. 2, #377 (January 1991).\nThe Green Scar identity is unleashed on Sakaar and is an enraged version of the Gravage Hulk. In addition, he is an expert in armed combat like the use of swords and shields. Green Scar is also a capable leader and an expert strategist.\nKluh is a personality of Hulk who is described as the \"Hulk's Hulk\". This form sports a white mohawk, black skin, and red lines on him.\nTitan is a more monstrous and malicious form of Hulk who stands at , has black skin, rock-like spikes on his shoulders, and possesses the ability to shoot lasers from his eyes. This personality was planted in Hulk by D'Spayre.\nPowers and abilities.\nBruce Banner.\nConsidered to be one of the greatest scientific minds on Earth, Banner possesses \"a mind so brilliant it cannot be measured on any known intelligence test.\" Norman Osborn estimates that he is the fourth most-intelligent person on Earth. Banner holds expertise in biology, chemistry, engineering, medicine, physiology, and nuclear physics. Using this knowledge, he creates advanced technology dubbed \"Bannertech\", which is on par with technological development from Tony Stark or Doctor Doom. These technologies include a teleporter and a force field that can protect him from the attacks of Hulk-level entities.\nAfter becoming a fugitive from the law, Banner is forced to go on the run and over the years learns various skills in order to both survive and remain under radar of those who are hunting him. Banner's most frequent method of travel includes hitchhiking, train hopping or simply just walking as he is unable to travel legally via planes, passenger ships or buses due to being in several travel watchlists. Banner is generally on the move and rarely ever stays in one place for very long and only does so if there's a possibility of curing himself. He will only ever stay in one place for an extended period of time if it provides him with complete solitude and privacy where the Hulk can do little to no harm.\nTo avoid being tracked, Banner does not use cell phones, debit or credit cards and will only use payphones or cash. He will often use fake identities when staying at motels or working jobs that require identification. Having been on the run for years, Banner can normally tell when he is being followed and will generally make a run for it when he is discovered. Having traveled across the globe, Banner is able to sneak over borders without being detected and can get by, by either knowing or learning the local language. Often traveling light, Banner has little to no possessions that he carries in either a satchel or backpack. Often losing everything he owns after transforming into the Hulk, Banner avoids keeping anything of personal value to him so that he can easily replace the items and clothes that were lost or destroyed.\nTo support himself financially, Banner will work quick part-time jobs and will only accept payments in cash. These jobs have varied from simply working in low pay diners to working as a local doctor. Banner's work ethic as well as his vast knowledge and skillset in science, medicine and engineering often help him get hired rather quickly. Unless desperate, Banner will generally avoid jobs that are high stress due to the potential danger of transforming into the Hulk.\nBanner has little to no memories of the Hulk's actions aside from his initial transformation which he described as being extremely painful. Banner's lack of memories often terrifies him as he has often transformed back to witness the devastating aftermath of the Hulk's battles which both saddens and encourages him to find a way to understand his condition so that he won't cause anymore destruction or harm. During his travels, Banner has developed several different techniques to help suppress or control his transformations when he becomes a little angry or upset. Among the techniques he has learned over the years include meditation and hypnotherapy. While they have helped him to better understand and suppress his transformations, none of the techniques Banner has learned have helped him to gain full control over the Hulk.\nThe Hulk.\nThe Hulk possesses the potential for seemingly limitless physical strength that is influenced by his emotional state, particularly his anger. This has been reflected in the repeated comment \"The madder Hulk gets, the stronger Hulk gets.\" The cosmically powerful entity known as the Beyonder once analyzed the Hulk's physiology, and claimed that the Hulk's potential strength had \"no finite element inside.\" Hulk's strength has been depicted as sometimes limited by Banner's subconscious influence; when Jean Grey psionically \"shut Banner off\", Hulk became strong enough to overpower and destroy the physical form of the villain Onslaught. Writer Greg Pak described the Worldbreaker Hulk shown during \"World War Hulk\" as having a level of physical power where \"Hulk was stronger than any mortal\u2014and most immortals\u2014who ever walked the Earth\" and depicted the character as powerful enough to completely destroy entire planets. His strength allows him to leap into lower Earth orbit or across continents, and he has displayed superhuman speed. Exposure to radiation has also been shown to make the Hulk stronger. It is unknown how he gains biomass during transformation but it may be linked to the One Below All.\nHis durability, regeneration, and endurance also increase in proportion to his temper. Hulk is resistant to injury or damage, though the degree to which varies between interpretations, but he has withstood the equivalent of solar temperatures, nuclear explosions, and planet-shattering impacts. Despite his remarkable resiliency, continuous barrages of high-caliber gunfire can hinder his movement to some degree while he can be temporarily subdued by intense attacks with chemical weapons such as anesthetic gases, although any interruption of such dosages will allow him to quickly recover. He has been shown to have both regenerative and adaptive healing abilities, including growing tissues to allow him to breathe underwater, surviving unprotected in space for extended periods, and when injured, healing from most wounds within seconds, including, on one occasion, the complete destruction of most of his body mass. His future self, the \"Maestro\", was even eventually able to recover from being blown to pieces. As an effect, he has an extremely prolonged lifespan.\nHe also possesses less commonly described powers, including abilities allowing him to \"home in\" to his place of origin in New Mexico; resist psychic control, or unwilling transformation; grow stronger from radiation or dark magic; punch his way between separate temporal or spatial dimensions; and to see and interact with astral forms. Some of these abilities were in later years explained as being related; his ability to home in on the New Mexico bomb site was due to his latent ability to sense astral forms and spirits, since the bomb site was also the place where the Maestro's skeleton was and the Maestro's spirit was calling out to him in order to absorb his radiation. \nSimilar to Banner, the Hulk views himself as a separate entity from Banner and often resents Banner's efforts to contain the Hulk within himself. Unable to maintain the same level of control Banner has over the transformations, the Hulk could initially only remain in his form for only short periods of time depending on the source of Banner's aggression that caused the transformation. This changed after the Hulk was exiled into Space by the Illuminati, angering him to the point where the Hulk was able to completely suppress Banner for an extended period of time. He is also shown to have a separate memory to Bruce Banner - when Spider-Man has the knowledge of his secret identity erased during \"Spider-Man: One More Day\", the Hulk later asks how Peter is doing, not Spider-Man; upon questioning, he enigmatically states \"Banner forgot. But I don't forget.\"\nIn the first \"Hulk\" comic series, \"massive\" doses of gamma rays would cause the Hulk to transform back to Banner, although this ability was written out of the character by the 1970s.\nSupporting characters.\nOver the long publication history of the Hulk's adventures, many recurring characters have featured prominently, including his best friend and sidekick Rick Jones, love interest and wife Betty Ross and her father, the often adversarial General \"Thunderbolt\" Ross. Both Banner and Hulk have families created in their respective personas. Banner is son to Brian, an abusive father who killed Banner's mother while she tried to protect her son from his father's delusional attacks, and cousin to Jennifer Walters, the She-Hulk, who serves as his frequent ally. Banner had a stillborn child with Betty, while the Hulk has two sons with his deceased second wife Caiera, Skaar and Hiro-Kala, and his DNA was used to create a daughter named Lyra with Thundra.\n\"The Fantastic Four\" #12 (March 1963), featured the Hulk's first battle with the Thing. Although many early Hulk stories involve Ross trying to capture or destroy the Hulk, the main villain is often a radiation-based character, like the Gargoyle or the Leader, along with other foes such as the Toad Men, or Asian warlord General Fang. Ross' daughter Betty loves Banner and criticizes her father for pursuing the Hulk. General Ross' right-hand man, Major Glenn Talbot, also loves Betty and is torn between pursuing Hulk and trying to gain Betty's love more honorably. Rick Jones serves as the Hulk's friend and sidekick in these early tales. The Hulk's archenemies are the Abomination and the Leader. The Abomination is more monstrous-looking, twice as strong as the Hulk at normal levels (however, the Abomination's strength levels do not increase when he gets angry) and wreaks havoc for fun and pleasure. The Leader is a gamma-irradiated super-genius who has tried plan after plan to take over the world.\nCultural impact.\nThe Hulk character and the concepts behind it have been raised to the level of iconic status by many within and outside the comic book industry. In 2003, \"Official U.S. PlayStation Magazine\" claimed the character had \"stood the test of time as a genuine icon of American pop culture.\" In 2008, the Hulk was listed as the 19th greatest comic book character by \"Wizard\" magazine. \"Empire\" magazine named him as the 14th-greatest comic-book character and the fifth-greatest Marvel character. In 2011, the Hulk placed No. 9 on IGN's list of \"Top 100 Comic Book Heroes\", and fourth on their list of \"The Top 50 Avengers\" in 2012.\nAnalysis.\nThe Hulk is often viewed as a reaction to war. As well as being a reaction to the Cold War, the character has been a cipher for the frustrations the Vietnam War raised, and Ang Lee said that the Iraq War influenced his direction. In the Michael Nyman edited edition of \"The Guardian\", Stefanie Diekmann explored Marvel Comics' reaction to the September 11 attacks. Diekmann discussed The Hulk's appearance in the 9/11 tribute comic \"Heroes\", claiming that his greater prominence, alongside Captain America, aided in \"stressing the connection between anger and justified violence without having to depict anything more than a well-known and well-respected protagonist.\" In \"Marvel: Five Fabulous Decades of the World's Greatest Comics\", Les Daniels addresses the Hulk as an embodiment of cultural fears of radiation and nuclear science. He quotes Jack Kirby thus: \"As long as we're experimenting with radioactivity, there's no telling what may happen, or how much our advancements in science may cost us.\" Daniels continues, \"The Hulk became Marvel's most disturbing embodiment of the perils inherent in the atomic age.\"\nIn \"Comic Book Nation\", Bradford Wright alludes to Hulk's counterculture status, referring to a 1965 \"Esquire\" magazine poll amongst college students which \"revealed that student radicals ranked Spider-Man and the Hulk alongside the likes of Bob Dylan and Che Guevara as their favorite revolutionary icons.\" Wright goes on to cite examples of his anti-authority symbol status. Two of these are \"The Ballad of the Hulk\" by Jerry Jeff Walker, and the \"Rolling Stone\" cover for September 30, 1971, a full color Herb Trimpe piece commissioned for the magazine. The Hulk has been caricatured in such animated television series as \"The Simpsons\", \"Robot Chicken\", and \"Family Guy\", and such comedy TV series as \"The Young Ones\". The character is also used as a cultural reference point for someone displaying anger or agitation. For example, in a 2008 \"Daily Mirror\" review of an \"EastEnders\" episode, a character is described as going \"into Incredible Hulk mode, smashing up his flat.\" In September 2019, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson likened himself to The Hulk in an interview with the \"Mail On Sunday\", as political pressure built on him to request an extension to the date of the UK's withdrawal from the European Union.\nThe Hulk, especially his alter ego Bruce Banner, is also a common reference in hip hop music. The term was represented as an analogue to marijuana in Dr. Dre's \"2001\", while more conventional references are made in Ludacris and Jermaine Dupri's popular single \"Welcome to Atlanta\".\nThe 2003 Ang Lee-directed \"Hulk\" film saw discussion of the character's appeal to Asian Americans. The Taiwanese-born Ang Lee commented on the \"subcurrent of repression\" that underscored the character of The Hulk, and how that mirrored his own experience: \"Growing up, my artistic leanings were always repressed\u2014there was always pressure to do something 'useful,' like being a doctor.\" Jeff Yang, writing for the \"San Francisco Chronicle\", extended this self-identification to Asian American culture, arguing that \"the passive-aggressive streak runs deep among Asian Americans\u2014especially those who have entered creative careers, often against their parents' wishes.\"\nThere have been explorations about the real-world possibility of Hulk's gamma-radiation-based origin. In \"The Science of Superheroes\", Lois Grest and Robert Weinberg examined Hulk's powers, explaining the scientific flaws in them. Most notably, they point out that the level of gamma radiation Banner is exposed to at the initial blast would induce radiation sickness and kill him, or if not, create significant cancer risks for Banner, because hard radiation strips cells of their ability to function. They go on to offer up an alternate origin, in which a Hulk might be created by biological experimentation with adrenal glands and GFP. Charles Q. Choi from LiveScience.com further explains that, unlike the Hulk, gamma rays are not green; existing as they do beyond the visible spectrum, gamma rays have no color at all that we can describe. He also explains that gamma rays are so powerful (the most powerful form of electromagnetic radiation and 10,000 times more powerful than visible light) that they can even convert energy into matter\u00a0\u2013 a possible explanation for the increased mass that Bruce Banner takes on during transformations. \"Just as the Incredible Hulk 'is the strongest one there is,' as he says himself, so too are gamma-ray bursts the most powerful explosions known.\"\nOther Marvel Comics characters called the Hulk.\nPrior to the debut of the Hulk in May 1962, Marvel had earlier monster characters that used the name the \"Hulk\", but had no direct relation.\nOther versions.\nA number of alternate universes and alternate timelines in Marvel Comics publications allow writers to introduce variations on the Hulk, in which the character's origins, behavior, and morality differ from the mainstream setting. In some stories, someone other than Bruce Banner is the Hulk.\nIn some versions, the Hulk succumbs to the darker side of his nature: in \"Future Imperfect\" (December 1992), a future version of the Hulk has become the Maestro, the tyrannical and ruthless ruler of a nuclear war-irradiated Earth, and in \"Old Man Logan\" (2008), an insane Hulk rules over a post-apocalyptic California and leads a gang of his inbred Hulk children created with his first cousin She-Hulk.\nAge of Apocalypse.\nIn the Age of Apocalypse alternative setting, Bruce Banner was never exposed to gamma radiation. Therefore, he did not become the Hulk. Instead he became a member of the Human High Council, where he was a scientist and became a weapons designer. However, he also yearns to gain knowledge and power, something Apocalypse was willing to help with, and so Bruce sold himself to Mikhail Rasputin, one of the Horsemen of Apocalypse, to give him mutants as test subjects. He succeeds in his experiments and can now transform into a creature resembling the Gray Hulk. He was used as a mole in the council, but was discovered by Susan Storm and Ben Grimm because the patterns of Bruce's injuries were identical to those sustained by the Hulk.\nLater, Banner attempted to redeem himself by jumping out of the Human High Council ship in an effort to prevent it from getting struck by a gamma missile of his own creation. The missile detonated, allowing the Human High Council to escape Earth. He fell back to Earth, landed in the Colosseum, and emerged as the Green Hulk. There were no further mentions of the Hulk in the Age of Apocalypse material.\nAge of X.\nIn the \"Age of X\" reality, Bruce Banner was a scientist who was under contract from the United States government to build a device that would depower any mutant. However, during the testing phase one of the mutant volunteers began to panic. Her powers caused the machine to go off prematurely while still in the gamma spectrum. The mutants were killed and Banner was bombarded by gamma radiation. The combination of the radiation and the fact that some of the mutants' genes were imprinted on him as well, caused Banner to transform into the Hulk. Because of his exposure to mutant genes, Banner holds a deep murderous resentment for all mutants to the point that he volunteered for a suicide mission to detonate a chemical bomb that would destroy the entire mutant stronghold, forcing his former teammates to sacrifice their lives to detonate the bomb early. He was incinerated by his own bomb when one of his former teammates named Redback (this reality's Spider-Woman) uses Steel Corpse's (this reality's Iron Man) severed glove to destroy the bomb.\nAmalgam Comics.\nThe Skulk is a hero of the Amalgam Universe. He is amalgamation of the Hulk and DC Comics' Solomon Grundy.\nBruce Banner was a scientist working with gamma rays. He was testing his gamma bomb out in the desert, but a tall figure walked out into the testing area. When Banner went out to see who it was, the man turned out to be Solomon Grundy. The bomb went off fusing Grundy and Banner together. When Banner gets angry he becomes Grundy, but the creature made a name for itself, calling itself Skulk.\nBreaker-Apart.\nIn a potential future, the One Below All is able to destroy Bruce Banner's soul and possesses the body of the Hulk. After which, it went on to kill Franklin Richards, Galactus, Mister Immortal, and many others until it was the only being left in the universe. Taking on Bruce's appearance, the One Below All encounters the Sentience of the Eighth Cosmos/Metatron and is able to trick and devour him, absorbing his powers. In the newly formed Ninth Cosmos, the One Below All used its newly acquired powers to transform Hulk into a Galactus-like being named the 'Breaker-Apart'. Ten billion years later, the Breaker-Apart has destroyed all light, all life, and all planets in the Multiverse. When Par%l tried to make contact and reason with it, the alien instead meets the abstract form of the One Below All which told him it wanted to \"Make all hollow as I, dark and dead as I\" and killed Par%l.\nBullet Points.\nIn the \"Bullet Points\" mini-series, Peter Parker finds himself on the test site for a Gamma bomb and absorbs a large dose of gamma radiation, becoming the Hulk. In a further twist, later in the series, in an attempt to find a cure for Peter, Bruce Banner examines specimens taken from the test site and is bitten by a radioactive spider, becoming Spider-Man.\nDeadpool: Samurai (Earth-346).\nIn the \"Deadpool: Samurai\" manga series, which takes place on Earth-346, Bruce Banner removes a control collar from the singer Neiro Aratabi, who had been saved from a deranged fan by Deadpool. Banner then attempts to transform into the Hulk to help Deadpool stop Hydra agents from retrieving the Gateway Controller, which had been hidden under the Tokyo Dome, but he was knocked unconscious by a piece of falling debris before he could finish his transformation. Banner did gradually regain consciousness and he then completed transforming into the Hulk, but he was quickly defeated by Thanos, who had been summoned by the Hydra agents.\nEarth X.\nThe Earth X series featured a vastly different take on the character, one in which the Hulk and Bruce Banner have finally achieved separation. However, they still rely on each other with Banner becoming a blind child who sees through the Hulk's eyes. In an interview in \"Comicology Volume I: The Kingdom Come Companion\", Alex Ross said that the design of Earth-X Banner and Hulk was based on the appearance of Moon-Boy and Devil Dinosaur.\nExiles.\nNumerous alternate versions of the Hulk appear in the \"Exiles\" series.\nHulk: Chapter One.\nIn the \"Hulk 1999 Annual\", writer John Byrne revised the Hulk's origin, much like his '. In the revised origin, the Gamma Bomb that was being tested is now a gamma laser, and a Skrull was responsible for Rick Jones' presence on the base during the gamma test. The Skrull also disguised himself as Igor Rasminsky (Drenkov in the original stories), a fellow scientist working on the project. The contemporary setting removes the Cold War context of the original story and serves as a tie-in to the ' maxi-series created by Roger Stern and Byrne, which also brought the origins of many Marvel characters out of the 1960s and into contemporary times. The storyline takes place on Earth-9992 and is not part of mainstream Marvel continuity (Earth-616).\nThe Last Avengers Story.\nIn the 1995 miniseries \"The Last Avengers Story\", Hulk was amongst those who joined Thor, The Thing and Hercules in a mysterious conflict known as the \"Great Cataclysm\" which threatened Olympus and Asgard. The event ended with Hulk holding Hercules's golden mace and his skin temporarily turned gray, suggesting that the Hulk was the only survivor of this conflict. After the Event Hulk was recruited alongside Mockingbird, Tigra, Wonder Man and Hawkeye to fight Ultron. However, Hulk had been seemingly corrupted by the events of the Great Cataclysm and turned on his allies, ripping Tigra in half and puncturing Wonder Man, Wonder Man unleashed his energy against the Hulk, seemingly killing them both and accidentally blinding Hawkeye. Hulk is finally defeated by Thor, which ends the chaos.\nInfernal Hulk.\nIn one alternative reality, Bruce Banner and the Hulk were magically separated. Banner became the new Sorcerer Supreme, and the Hulk was cast into hell. However, while in hell, the Hulk became corrupted by the demonic beings he encountered, transforming him into a demon himself. Now completely evil, he escaped from hell and attempted to kill Banner. With help from the mainstream Hulk, Banner tricked the \"infernal\" Hulk into shattering the Eye of Agamotto, causing him to be thrown back into hell.\nMaestro.\nSet in a post apocalyptic future, the Hulk has mutated into the dictator Maestro ruling the remains of humanity with an iron fist. Ruthless, sadistic, violent, and tyrannical, the Maestro was shown to be an example of what would happen if the Hulk ever embraced his darker roots. Maestro was known to be an enemy of the Hulk, as the two alternate versions fought each other on Maestro's world.\nMarvel 2099.\nThe unified Marvel Noir reality of Earth-2099 featured a version of Hulk 2009. In addition, there was a 2099 version of Gray Hulk who was a member of the 2099 version of the Avengers until he was among those who were killed by the 2099 version of the Masters of Evil. The 2099 version of Moon Knight survived the massacre and formed the 2099 version of the New Avengers with Hulk 2099 as one of its members as they avenged Gray Hulk 2099 and the fallen Avengers by defeating the Masters of Evil and having them remanded to a prison on the planet Wakanda.\nOtto Banner.\nDuring the \"Devil's Reign\" storyline, Doctor Octopus started forming his Superior Four that includes a Hulk who has four extra arms growing from his back. His real name is Otto Banner of Earth-8816 and he was also abused by his Earth's version of Brian Banner.\nRuins.\nIn the Warren Ellis series \"Ruins\", a dark flip to the Kurt Busiek tale \"Marvels\", the accidents, experiments and mutations that led to the creation of Super Heroes and super humans, instead led to terrible deformations and painful deaths. Here, Bruce Banner's story goes exactly the same as his 616 counterpart, but when he is caught in the middle of the gamma bomb explosion, instead of transforming into the Incredible Hulk, his whole body opens up from the gigantic tumors that appear inside it, pushing most of his organs and skull outside his body and giving Rick Jones cancer. He did not die, and was put in an underground vault by the CIA, codenamed \"the Hulk\".\nSecret Wars (2015).\nDuring the \"Secret Wars\" storyline, several versions of Hulk reside in each Battleworld domain.\nSpider-Geddon.\nDuring the \"Spider-Geddon\" storyline, a sequel to \"Spider-Verse\", Robbie Banner is a punk on Earth-138 who is allied with Spider-Punk and can turn into the Hulk while listening to \"Atomic Bomb\" music. He helped Spider-Punk and Captain Anarchy fight the U-Foes at the Hellfire Club, assisted Spider-Punk and M.C. Strange push the Universal Church of Truth out of Queens, and fought Hydra on the streets. After obtaining the \"Atomic Bomb\" tape from Captain Anarchy, Spider-Punk visited Robbie to get his help, but the latter was reluctant to listen to the tape. When Kang the Conglomerator went on the attack, Robbie reluctantly listened to the tape and transformed into the Hulk to help Spider-Punk fight Kang.\nThe End.\nIn other tales, possible futures for the character have been shown. Using a post apocalyptic wasteland as a backdrop, the Peter David written \"\" one-shot features an elderly Bruce Banner as the last surviving inhabitant of Earth, the Hulk having hidden in a cave during a nuclear war until he was released by the Recorder sent to confirm humanity's demise. After Bruce has spent time traveling Earth, transforming into the Hulk at night and when attacked by the mutated cockroaches that are the only other surviving lifeforms on Earth, the story concludes with Banner dying of a heart attack, thus leaving the Hulk as the last living being on the planet. Acknowledging that he would also die if he changes back into Banner, the Hulk reflects on the fact that he has finally achieved his wish to be alone.\nUltimate Marvel.\nAn alternate universe variant of Bruce Banner / Hulk from Earth-1610 appears in the Ultimate Marvel imprint. This version is a scientist working for S.H.I.E.L.D. who gained his powers from an attempt to recreate the Super-Soldier Formula that created Captain America. Additionally, Hulk is depicted as more malicious, representing Banner's hidden emotions and id.\nUltimate Universe.\nDuring the \"Ultimate Invasion\" storyline, Maker visits Earth-6160 and remakes it into his own image. One of the things he could not succeed in was preventing the origin of Hulk, who would later find personal \"enlightenment\". He and his fellow monks of the Children of the Eternal Light would later attend an international event held by the Maker at the City in Latveria as part of his Council. Hulk and the Children of the Eternal Light are revealed to rule India and parts of Asia.\nIn other media.\nThe character has been played in live-action and animation by a variety of actors. The character was first played in live-action by Bill Bixby and Lou Ferrigno in the 1978 television series \"The Incredible Hulk\" and its subsequent television films \"The Incredible Hulk Returns\" (1988), \"The Trial of the Incredible Hulk\" (1989), and \"The Death of the Incredible Hulk\" (1990), and Eric Bana in the film \"Hulk\" (2003). In the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), the character was first portrayed by Edward Norton in the film \"The Incredible Hulk\" (2008) and by Mark Ruffalo in later appearances, including the films \"The Avengers\" (2012), \"Iron Man 3\" (2013), ' (2015), ' (2017), ' (2018), \"Captain Marvel\" (2019), ' (2019), \"Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings\" (2021), and ' (2026), and the television series ' (2022) and \"What If...?\" (2021).

{"id": "31513", "revid": "35936988", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31513", "title": "Champion of the Universe", "text": "The Champion of the Universe (Tryco Slatterus) is a fictional character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. He is not necessarily a villain but has played the role in the past through his impetuous and arrogant actions.\nPublication history.\nHe first appeared in \"Marvel Two-in-One Annual\" #7 (1982), and was created by Tom DeFalco and Ron Wilson.\nFictional character biography.\nThe Champion is one of the alien Elders of the Universe. He is an immortal who claims to have been born billions of years ago in the Ancrindo Nebula. Although he wishes to prove himself the greatest warrior in the universe, he usually does so fairly. He keeps himself busy by fighting powerful warriors throughout the universe. The Champion of the Universe's Promoter Supreme named Proja preceded the Champion's journey to Earth and recruited the superheroes Thing, Namor, Hulk, Colossus, Sasquatch, Thor, Doc Samson, and Wonder Man to a boxing match in Madison Square Garden. The heroes are defeated or disqualified, but the Thing refuses to give up and convinces the Champion to surrender.\nThe Champion later attempted to kill the Silver Surfer to prevent him from interfering with a Skrull plot to use Nova to force Galactus to destroy the Kree Empire. The Champion was overpowered by the Silver Surfer, suffering his first known defeat in combat. The Champion was one of the eleven Elders who sought to restart the universe by killing Galactus. He attempted to kill Mantis but she was rescued by the Silver Surfer. The Champion then battled Galactus and the Silver Surfer but was converted to energy and consumed by Galactus. The Champion and the other four Elders devoured by Galactus caused Galactus \"cosmic indigestion\" from within until they were forced out of him by Master Order and Lord Chaos. After the other Elders leave, the Champion obtains the Power Gem, one of the Infinity Gems.\nLater, the Champion had settled on the planet Skardon, whose native Skard exist in a \"might makes right\" culture; all disputes, including matters of law, are settled in a trial by combat. By defeating Skardon's most powerful fighters in the natives' boxing-ring-esque arena, the Champion became the ruler of the planet. He is later defeated and dethroned by She-Hulk.\nAfterward, the Champion took the new name of \"The Fallen One\" in disgrace. He also attempted to take revenge through a proxy, passing the Power Gem to the heroine's arch-enemy Titania (who also failed to defeat She-Hulk). Upon learning that the Champion can return the Power Gem that contains the \"Power Primordial\" to himself at any time, Titania smashed him with a giant rock mass, believing that he would be kept buried below it.\nWhen the Deadpool Corps was chosen to go defeat The Awareness, the Champion deemed them unworthy and sought to challenge them. However he is tricked and left stranded on an empty planet after the Deadpool Corps steals his motorcycle. After being rescued by the Gardener, the Champion tracks down Deadpool at a bar and begins to fight, but is eventually convinced to join the team under the name \"Championpool.\" He is soon tricked into going to fight on another deserted planet, only to find that there are no warriors to fight and his rocket cycle is without fuel, leaving him stranded.\nThe Champion of the Universe was with the other Elders of the Universe during Thanos' meeting with them. Thanos caused the supposed deaths of those present.\nAfter the multiverse was restored in \"Secret Wars\", the Champion of the Universe took part in a Contest of Champions between the other Elders of the Universe to determine who would keep the Power Primordial. He was eliminated from the contest when his champions lost.\nThane and Death sent the Champion of the Universe to recruit Starfox in a plot to take Thanos down when they learn that Thanos is dying.\nPowers and abilities.\nThe Champion controls an energy source referred to as the Power Primordial. This energy is apparently residual energy that is left over from the Big Bang itself. The Champion has spent countless eons channeling this energy force into the perfection of his physical form. Physically, he is the most powerful of the Elders but he is unable to channel the energy into force blasts, flight, matter manipulation, telepathy or to increase his intelligence as the other Elders can.\nThe Champion possesses vast physical strength, that is only limited by the amount of cosmic force that his body can contain. The Thing noted that the Champion hit him harder than either the Hulk or the Silver Surfer (without wearing the Power Gem at the time). When Reed Richards measured the residual power levels left behind when Champion abducted Thing, he declared that the Champion was on a higher level than Galactus. This does not likely represent Galactus' maximum power levels though, as Reed's measurements would have been based on Galactus' strength in one of their six previous meetings, during several of which Galactus was extremely weakened from hunger.\nThe Champion's body does not tire from physical exertion, since his musculature generates no lactic acids and, as the Power Primordial sustains him, he is not limited by the need for food, drink, or sleep, and is virtually immune to aging, diseases and infections. He can exist unprotected in the vacuum of space indefinitely. He is extremely resistant against all forms of conventional injury, and in addition Death has barred the Elders from entering its realm, literally making the Champion immortal. However, this does not make him immune to damage. The Champion's ribs have been broken by the Thing, and he has been beaten unconscious by the She-Hulk, or the power cosmic of the Silver Surfer.\nThe Champion is a master hand-to-hand combatant in a wide range of thousands of different martial arts and fighting-styles taken from locations across the Universe, but tends to prefer boxing.\nWhile possessing the Infinity Gem of Power, the Champion unconsciously used it to further increase his power with his rage, so that during his fight with Thanos his strength increased to the point where he destroyed the planet on which they were fighting with a single punch. While wielding the Gem of Power as a good luck charm, Champion was able to manipulate entire battlefields for his amusement. He could withstand direct, point blank and consistent shots of Thanos's energy beams at full power. Thanos noted that the Champion's rampage was one of the few forces that could cause his personal force field to buckle and disengage.\nCharacteristics.\nThe Champion is a thoroughly ruthless and cold-blooded individual ever searching for the thrill of battle. When first introduced he was more than willing to annihilate the entire population on Earth unless a fighter would defeat him limited to boxing rules. However he relented when impressed by the Thing's ability to give him a challenge (breaking his ribs), and relentless spirit never to give up, and spared the Earth and declared the bout a draw rather than kill his opponent. When collaborating with the other Elders he schemed to destroy the Universe to be reborn as new versions of Galactus. In the miniseries \"Thanos Quest\" he killed an entire planetary population of soldiers just for sport. Later he assumed leadership of another planet and indifferently set the population to civil war, to provoke worthy challengers into seeking him out to put a stop to it. He is a strong male chauvinist and does not consider women as opponents worthy of him, only \"appreciating\" their value as courtesans or breeding stock.\nThe Power Primordial sustains the Elders through their desire and will to continue pursuing their various interests. The Champion's interests are fighting, training to fight, and seeking opponents to fight. If the Champion were to grow uninterested in his pursuits and chose not to continue them, he could potentially die as a result, although since Death decreed no Elder could ever enter its realm, this may no longer be true.\nAlthough several billion years old, the Champion is not as intelligent as most other known Elders of the Universe, partially because most have chosen to develop their minds along with their physical bodies. Regardless, he has some familiarity with advanced alien technologies that surpass the understanding of most Earthlings and has been shown as a crafty strategist when not blinded by rage.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "31514", "revid": "45364314", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31514", "title": "Beyonder", "text": "Marvel Comics fictional character\nThe Beyonder () is a fictional cosmic entity appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Created by writer Jim Shooter and artist Mike Zeck, the Beyonder first appeared in \"Secret Wars\" #1 (May 1984) as an unseen, nigh-omnipotent being from outside the multiverse who kidnapped the heroes and villains of the Marvel Universe to have them do battle on Battleworld, a fictional planet created by the Beyonder. The character plays a more antagonistic role in the 1985 sequel, \"Secret Wars II\", in which he takes human form to learn about desire but threatens to destroy the multiverse out of increasing frustration.\nFollowing \"Secret Wars\" and \"Secret Wars II\", the Beyonder experienced many notable retcons. At first, he was changed to a Cosmic Cube that was incomplete because of the Molecule Man. The Illuminati suggested he was a mutant Inhuman. Finally, he is revealed to be a \"child\" of the Beyonder race.\nPublication history.\nCreated by writer Jim Shooter and artist Mike Zeck, the Beyonder first appeared in \"Secret Wars\" #1, as an unseen, apparently nearly omnipotent being. He reappears in \"Secret Wars II\" #1 (July 1985), which was written by Shooter and drawn by Al Milgrom.\nFictional character biography.\n\"Secret Wars\".\nThe Beyonder is the manifestation of the \"Beyond-Realm\", which exists separately from the multiverse. This dimension was accidentally accessed by lab technician Owen Reece; some of the energy from the dimension escapes and imbues Reece with infinite powers, which he wields as the villainous Molecule Man, and the remaining energy gains sentience and becomes the Beyonder. The Beyonder creates a planet called Battleworld out of pieces of various planets and abducts a number of superheroes and supervillains from Earth and forces them to fight each other so that he can observe the never-ending battle between good and evil. During this time, his powers are briefly stolen by Doctor Doom.\n\"Secret Wars II\".\nIntrigued by what he has witnessed during the first Secret Wars, the Beyonder comes to Earth during the \"Secret Wars II\" story line to walk among humans and study them and learn of human desire firsthand. He creates a human body for himself (this body originally resembles Molecule Man). He also transforms a television writer named Steward Cadwell into Thundersword. Finally, the Beyonder creates a form for himself based on that of Captain America after witnessing him defeat Armadillo.\nAfter learning of the importance of money from Luke Cage, the Beyonder turns a building into pure gold, causing Spider-Man to rescue those trapped in the building, while the U.S. government works to get rid of the gold to avoid a financial crisis. The Beyonder later meets the blind superhero Daredevil and restores his sight, asking for legal representation in return. After realizing that the desire to protect his eyesight might compromise his integrity and dedication, Daredevil demands that the Beyonder take his sight away again, which he does. After becoming involved with a woman named Sharon Ing, when it is revealed that he is open to loving women and men and can also change his own gender, Beyonder attempts to get Dazzler to fall in love with him, but fails, leading to feelings of despair. Following this, the Beyonder is recruited to be a professional wrestler and is nearly killed by Thing in a Unlimited Class Wrestling Federation wrestling match.\nIn order to combat Beyonder, Mephisto sent his demon agent Bitterhorn to form the Legion Accursed. While waiting for the Legion Accursed to arrive, Mephisto tricked Thing into signing a contract that would increase his strength. When the Legion had arrived, Thing had to defend Beyonder from them. By the time Mephisto planned to drop his contract with Thing, nearly all of the Legion were defeated. Due to Beyonder and Thing ruining his plan, Mephisto returned all the villains to where they were before he began his scheme.\nAfter being encouraged to find enlightenment by Doctor Strange, and failing, a frustrated Beyonder decides to destroy the entire multiverse, leading to several more battles with various Marvel superheroes, all of which end up with the Beyonder victorious. The Beyonder is finally defeated by a huge group of superheroes, including the Fantastic Four, X-Men, Avengers, and Spider-Man, after the Molecule Man intervenes and kills him, while he had temporarily transformed into an infant in the midst of a re-birthing process. The Beyonder's energy returns to the Beyond-Realm, where it evolves into a new universe.\n\"Deadpool Team-Up\".\nLong after the \"Secret Wars II\" crossover had ended, a Deadpool special featured the \"Secret Wars II continues in this issue\" corner tag that was used during that original storyline. In this issue, a younger, less-experienced Deadpool is hired by the Kingpin to kill the Beyonder. The flashback sequence ends with Deadpool chasing him into a portal with a footnote saying \"to be continued in Secret Wars III\".\nKosmos and the Maker.\nThe tale of the Beyonder continues several years later when it is revealed that, in the distant past, the enigmatic Beyonders created pocket universes holding vast amounts of sentient energy. Some are tapped into by various beings, including Skrulls and humans, to create reality-warping Cosmic Cubes. The Beyonder is told that this is his origin, but he is missing a containment vessel and the Molecule Man absorbed part of his energy. They merge and shape themselves into a Cube.\nThe Cube expels the Molecule Man from its form, returning him to Earth, and soon evolves into the cosmic being known as Kosmos. Kosmos takes on a female form and is tutored by Kubik, touring the universe with him. When the Molecule Man's lover Volcana leaves him, he becomes angry, extracts the Beyonder from Kosmos, and proceeds to attack him until Kubik intervenes.\nAt some unknown point, Kosmos becomes insane and assumes a mortal form, now calling itself the Maker. After the amnesiac Maker destroys a Shi'ar colony, the Imperial Guard imprison it in the interstellar prison called the Kyln. The Maker's madness takes control of several inmates but is finally subdued by Thanos and several of his allies among the prisoners. Thanos confronts the Maker, and, by refusing to reveal its origins at a critical juncture, manipulates it to psychically shut down its own mind. Thanos instructs the Shi'ar that the body should be kept alive but brain-dead, or the Beyonder essence would go free again.\nIn the \"Annihilation\" crossover story line, the Fallen One, a former Herald of Galactus under the control of Thanos, is sent to investigate the aftermath of the Kyln's destruction by the Annihilation Wave and ascertain the Beyonder's fate. The Fallen One finds the lifeless form of the Maker in the rubble, confirming the Beyonder's freedom.\nThe Illuminati.\nIn a retcon of past events, Charles Xavier reveals to his fellow Illuminati members that in the original Secret War, he had attempted to mind-scan the Beyonder, revealing him as one of the Inhumans previously ruled over by Black Bolt. Xavier also deduced the apparent secret behind the Beyonder's seemingly godlike abilities, which was that the Beyonder was not only an Inhuman but also a mutant, and the exposure of his mutant genes to Terrigen Mist had created an unprecedented power.\nThis revelation leads to a confrontation with the Beyonder during the events of the second Secret War, wherein Black Bolt expresses his extreme displeasure toward the Beyonder's activities. When encountered, the Beyonder is dwelling in a simulacrum of Manhattan Island on Ceres. The Illuminati convince the Beyonder to leave the universe, causing the Beyonder's human form and his simulacrum city to crumble into dust. However, Black Bolt admits that he has no memory of an Inhuman becoming the Beyonder, and the final image of the story reveals that the entire event was in the pupil of the Beyonder's right eye, thus making the revelations dubious.\nTime Runs Out.\nHank Pym is sent by the Illuminati to investigate the Incursions and the collapsing multiverse. Upon discovering the truth of the Ivory Kings, Pym returns to the Illuminati to warn them about their enemy: the Beyonders. He refers to the Beyonder from the original Secret Wars as a \"child unit\" of the Beyonders.\nThe Molecule Man later reiterates the same thing while also revealing that the accident that gave him his power and the \"child Beyonder\" his awareness was engineered by the Beyonders.\nDefenders.\nThe Beyonder appears to the Defenders after they left the multiverse. He explains the history of the Beyonders before reluctantly joining the Defenders on their quest. Upon reaching the House of Ideas, he decides to break free from and leave the story of the One Above All, promising to return on his own terms.\nPowers and abilities.\nThe Beyonder is an infinite-dimensional, or beyond-dimensional, entity and was originally portrayed as the most powerful being in the Marvel Comics multiverse, and as the be-all and end-all of the \"Beyond Realm\", that took human form to better understand the nature of human beings.\nThe narration stated that he possessed power millions of times greater than the entire multiverse combined, and that a regular universe was a drop of water in the ocean compared to the Beyond Realm.\nThe Beyonder proved capable of destroying, and recreating, the abstract entity known as Death across the multiverse, although it extremely exerted and weakened him to do so. However, even in this state, he was capable of easily sending a horde of demons back to hell with a wave of his hand.\nDespite his power, the Beyonder has shown moments of vulnerability. He was overwhelmed when Rachel Summers returned the enormous powers that he had bestowed upon her along with the thoughts of the past and present beings in the universe, to the point that he collapsed on the ground, and he was apparently slowed down in battle against the Molecule Man. He also lost part, or all, of his power on various occasions, some of them engineered by himself. He also stated that the Puma\u2014when in perfect harmony with the Universe\u2014was capable of killing him. However, on another occasion, after trying to be a superhero by fighting a superpowered biker gang, the Beyonder stated that he limits his powers to keep them more in line with the world around him.\nAfter his creator, Jim Shooter, left Marvel, writer-editor Tom DeFalco re-tooled the Beyonder, diminishing his power greatly: He was no longer nearly omnipotent, and several of the cosmic beings who were previously established to be below him in power were vastly upgraded in conjunction.\nNonetheless, the Beyonder retained his reality-warping powers, allowing him to control and manipulate matter, energy, and reality at a cosmic level beyond all but the strongest and most powerful of cosmic entities.\nHe repelled Galactus \"like a bug\", and exceeded the collected energy of the latter's World-Ship. He once destroyed a galaxy on a whim to meet his needs during the first Secret Wars, and later created a universe out of his own being. When the Molecule Man extracted the Beyonder from Kosmos, their battle took place in more than three spatial dimensions, and threatened to cause vast destruction across the multiverse. In Kosmos' 'Maker' incarnation, she was stated as capable of reversing The Crunch itself, essentially collapsing the universe. However, his scale of power was stated to be significantly below the Living Tribunal and Eternity, the Celestials, or Molecule Man.\nAfter The Beyonder was retconned again to be a child of the race of Beyonders, and he was later seen fully grown and interacting with an assembly of them, his power was presumably upgraded to a similar scale to them, and other Beyonders have together managed to kill the Living Tribunal and all of the Celestials in the Marvel multiverse. However, it was stated that he is considerably less powerful than the multiversal Phoenix Force.\nOther versions.\n\"Guardians of the Galaxy\".\nIn \"Guardians of the Galaxy\", the Beyonder provides Guardian Vance Astro with a black undergarment resembling a Symbiote. Later, he attempts to hold captive Prot\u00e9g\u00e9, the leader of the Universal Church of Truth. Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 retaliates using his limitless ability to copy the abilities of other beings to become a match for the Beyonder. They battle until Eternity and the Living Tribunal intervene.\n\"Heroes Reborn\".\nIn an alternate reality depicted in the \"Heroes Reborn\" storyline, a character named Mister Beyonder appears as an inmate of the Negative Zone before escaping and confronting Hyperion, claiming that his reality is not what it seems. Despite being perturbed by his words, Hyperion defeats Mister Beyonder.\n\"Mutant X\".\nIn \"Mutant X\", the Beyonder allies with Dracula to wage war on Earth's forces and confront the Goblyn Queen.\n\"Spider-Ham\".\nThe Bee-Yonder, a funny animal version of the Beyonder from Earth-8311, appears in \"Peter Porker, the Spectacular Spider-Ham\".\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Lhasa was central part of Wu Ru (Chinese:\u4f0d\u5982 Tibetan: \u0f51\u0f56\u0f74\u0f0b\u0f62\u0f74), the battle of U-Yor lasted for 12 years in Wu Ru and also marked the end of Wu Ru.\nThe eastern regions of Kham and Amdo often maintained a more decentralized indigenous political structure, being divided among a number of small principalities and tribal groups, while also often falling under Chinese rule; most of this area was eventually annexed into the Chinese provinces of Sichuan and Qinghai. The current borders of Tibet were generally established in the 18th century after an imperial edict from the Emperor Kangxi was published for the Imperial Stele Inscriptions of the Pacification of Tibet in 1720 AD, and Thirteen Articles for the Settlement of Qinghai Affairs were submitted to Emperor Yongzheng in 1724.\nFollowing the Xinhai Revolution against the Qing dynasty in 1912, Qing soldiers were disarmed and escorted out of Tibet, but it was constitutionally claimed by the Republic of China as the Tibet Area. The 13th Dalai Lama in 1913, although it was neither recognised by the Chinese Republican government nor any foreign power. Lhasa later took control of western Xikang as well. Following the Chinese Communist Revolution, neighboring Qinghai established the Qinghai Province People's Government in 1950, allegiant to the newly-proclaimed People's Republic of China (PRC).\nThe Tibet region maintained its autonomy until 1951 when, following the Battle of Chamdo, it was occupied and annexed by the People's Republic of China after the 14th Dalai Lama ratified the Seventeen Point Agreement on 24 October 1951. The Tibetan government was abolished after the failure of the 1959 Tibetan uprising. Today, China governs Tibet as the Xizang Autonomous Region while the eastern Tibetan areas are now mostly autonomous prefectures within Qinghai, Gansu, Yunnan and Sichuan provinces.\nThe Tibetan independence movement is principally led by the Tibetan diaspora. Various human rights organizations have reported restrictions on civil liberties, including limitations on religious practices, freedom of expression, and assembly, with the Chinese government maintaining strict control over information. Reports on the extent of these restrictions vary, and claims of cultural suppression, including the Sinicization of Tibet, are a subject of debate among scholars and international observers.\nThe dominant religion in Tibet is Tibetan Buddhism; other religions include B\u00f6n, an indigenous religion similar to Tibetan Buddhism, Islam, and Christianity. Tibetan Buddhism is a primary influence on the art, music, and festivals of the region. Tibetan architecture reflects Chinese and Indian influences. Staple foods in Tibet are roasted barley, yak meat, and butter tea. With the growth of tourism in recent years, the service sector has become the largest sector in Tibet, accounting for 50.1% of the local GDP in 2020. In 2024, more than 63.89 million domestic and foreign tourists visited Xizang.\nNames and etymologies.\nThe first known English word \"Tibet\" dates back to 1827 CE and may have been derived from older terms in other languages similar to Mongol term \"Tibyet\", or \"T\u00f6bed\". The first known Chinese words \"Xizang\" and the simplified form \"Zang\" date back to time between 1591 CE (\u4e07\u5386\u5341\u516b\u5e74) and 1592 CE (\u4e07\u5386\u5341\u4e5d\u5e74) in the memorial to the throne of Zh\u00e8ng Lu\u00f2 (\u90d1\u6d1b) in the Ming Dynasty. The first known official use of \"Xizang\" in Qing records dates back to 1663 CE (\u5eb7\u7199\u4e8c\u5e74) In 1720 the Kangxi Emperor of Qing dynasty wrote an edict for the Imperial Stele Inscriptions of the Pacification of Tibet in Han, Manchu, Mongolian, and Tibetan languages. At that point, Xizang officially appeared, replacing other terms like \"Kokham\" (\u6735\u7518) and \"Ali Sankor\" (\u963f\u91cc\u4e09\u5ed3, \"Nari Sugulusun\" in the Yuan and Ming dynasties). The Manchu term is Wargi Dzang, and the Mongol term is T\u00f6bed. \"Xizang\" was subsequently used in all documents such as 13-Article Ordinance for the More Effective Governing of Tibet in 1751, also 29-Article Ordinance for the More Effective Governing of Tibet of 1793. Xizang has become synonymous in China with the Tibet Autonomous Region.\nSince the Thirteen Articles for the Settlement of Qinghai Affairs were submitted to Emperor Yongzheng in 1724, for the demarcations made during the Yongzheng reign, the borders between Tibet, Qinghai, Sichuan and Yunnan were basically determined \nThe endonymic Tibetan term for Tibet is \"Bod\" (\"B\u00f6\"). The Standard Tibetan pronunciation of \"Bod\" () is transcribed as: \"Bh\u00f6\" in Tournadre Phonetic Transcription; \"B\u00f6\" in the THL Simplified Phonetic Transcription; and \"Poi\" in Tibetan pinyin. Some scholars believe the first written reference to \"Bod\" (\"Tibet\") was the ancient Bautai people recorded in the Egyptian-Greek works \"Periplus of the Erythraean Sea\" (1st century CE) and \"Geographia\" (Ptolemy, 2nd century CE), itself from the Sanskrit form \"Bhau\u1e6d\u1e6da\" of the Indian geographical tradition.\nThe best-known medieval Chinese name for Tibet is \"Tubo\" (; or , \u571f\u8543 or , \u571f\u756a). This name first appears in Chinese characters as in the 7th century (Li Tai) and as in the 10th century (\"Old Book of Tang\", describing 608\u2013609 emissaries from Tibetan King Namri Songtsen to Emperor Yang of Sui). In the Middle Chinese language spoken during that period, as reconstructed by William H. Baxter, was pronounced \"thux-phjon\", and was pronounced \"thux-pjon\" (with the \"x\" representing a \"shang\" tone).\nOther pre-modern Chinese names for Tibet include:\nHistorical linguists generally agree that \"Tibet\" names in European languages are loanwords from Arabic or (), itself deriving from Turkic \"\" (plural of ), literally 'The Heights'.\nThe term \"Greater Tibet\" includes broad areas and people of multiple countries such as Central Asian Republics, Pakistan, India, etc.\nLanguage.\nLinguists generally classify the Tibetan language as a Tibeto-Burman language of the Sino-Tibetan language family, although the boundaries between 'Tibetan' and certain other Himalayan languages can be unclear. According to Matthew Kapstein:\nFrom the perspective of historical linguistics, Tibetan most closely resembles Burmese among the major languages of Asia. Grouping these two together with other apparently related languages spoken in the Himalayan lands, as well as in the highlands of Southeast Asia and the Sino-Tibetan frontier regions, linguists have generally concluded that there exists a Tibeto-Burman family of languages. More controversial is the theory that the Tibeto-Burman family is itself part of a larger language family, called Sino-Tibetan, and that through it Tibetan and Burmese are distant cousins of Chinese.\nThe language has numerous regional dialects which are generally not mutually intelligible. It is employed throughout the Tibetan plateau and Bhutan and is also spoken in parts of Nepal and northern India, such as Sikkim. In general, the dialects of central Tibet (including Lhasa), Kham, Amdo and some smaller nearby areas are considered Tibetan dialects. Other forms, particularly Dzongkha, Sikkimese, Sherpa, and Ladakhi, are considered by their speakers, largely for political reasons, to be separate languages. However, if the latter group of Tibetan-type languages are included in the calculation, then 'greater Tibetan' is spoken by approximately 6\u00a0million people across the Tibetan Plateau. Tibetan is also spoken by approximately 150,000 exile speakers who have fled from modern-day Tibet to India and other countries.\nAlthough spoken Tibetan varies according to the region, the written language, based on Classical Tibetan, is consistent throughout. This is probably due to the long-standing influence of the Tibetan empire, whose rule embraced (and extended at times far beyond) the present Tibetan linguistic area, which runs from Gilgit Baltistan in the west to Yunnan and Sichuan in the east, and from north of Qinghai Lake south as far as Bhutan. The Tibetan language has its own script which it shares with Ladakhi and Dzongkha, and which is derived from the ancient Indian Br\u0101hm\u012b script.\nStarting in 2001, the local deaf sign languages of Tibet were standardized, and Tibetan Sign Language is now being promoted across the country.\nThe first Tibetan-English dictionary and grammar book was written by Alexander Csoma de K\u0151r\u00f6s in 1834.\nHistory.\nEarly history.\nHumans inhabited the Tibetan Plateau at least 21,000 years ago. This population was largely replaced around 3,000 BP by Neolithic immigrants from northern China, but there is a partial genetic continuity between the Paleolithic inhabitants and contemporary Tibetan populations.\nThe earliest Tibetan historical texts identify the Zhang Zhung culture as a people who migrated from the Amdo region into what is now the region of Guge in western Tibet. Zhang Zhung is considered to be the original home of the B\u00f6n religion. By the 1st century BCE, a neighboring kingdom arose in the Yarlung valley, and the Yarlung king, Drigum Tsenpo, attempted to remove the influence of the Zhang Zhung by expelling the Zhang's B\u00f6n priests from Yarlung. He was assassinated and Zhang Zhung continued its dominance of the region until it was annexed by Songtsen Gampo in the 7th century. Prior to Songtsen Gampo, the kings of Tibet were more mythological than factual, and there is insufficient evidence of their existence.\nTibetan Empire.\nIn the 6th century, the king, Namri Songtsen, began to annex neighboring tribes by force, he was later murdered, and his son Songtsen Gampo succeeded him and quelled rebellions in various regions. Songtsen Gampo inherited his father's will and successively conquered and annexed other countries such as \"Songbo\" in the Yushu area of Qinghai, Sumpa in the west, \"Kangguo\" (called \"Dongnwu Kingdom\" in the Old Book of Tang) in Qianduo (now Chamdo), \"Fuguo (Chinese:\u9644\u56fd)\" in Ganzi, \"Fanlu (Chinese:\u8543\u7eff)\" in Litang, and Tuyuhun in Qinghai. Songtsen Gampo also led a large army to attack Zhangzhung in 642. It took him three years to conquer Zhangzhung and sent Khyungpo Pungse Sutse as the governor of Zhangzhung. Zhangzhung then became a vassal state of the Tibetan Empire.\nSongtsen Gampo also brought in many reforms, and Tibetan power spread rapidly, creating a large and powerful empire. It is traditionally considered that his first wife was the Princess of Nepal, Bhrikuti, and that she played a great role in the establishment of Buddhism in Tibet. In 640, he married Princess Wencheng, the niece of the Chinese emperor Taizong of Tang China.\nUnder the next few Tibetan kings, Buddhism became established as the state religion and Tibetan power increased even further over large areas of Central Asia, while major inroads were made into Chinese territory, even reaching the Tang's capital Chang'an (modern Xi'an) in late 763. However, the Tibetan occupation of Chang'an only lasted for fifteen days, after which they were defeated by Tang and its ally, the Turkic Uyghur Khaganate.\nThe Kingdom of Nanzhao (in Yunnan and neighbouring regions) remained under Tibetan control from 750 to 794, when they turned on their Tibetan overlords and helped the Chinese inflict a serious defeat on the Tibetans.\nIn 747, the hold of Tibet was loosened by the campaign of general Gao Xianzhi, who tried to re-open the direct communications between Central Asia and Kashmir. By 750, the Tibetans had lost almost all of their central Asian possessions to the Chinese. However, after Gao Xianzhi's defeat by the Arabs and Qarluqs at the Battle of Talas (751) and the subsequent civil war known as the An Lushan Rebellion (755), Chinese influence decreased rapidly and Tibetan influence resumed.\nAt its height in the 780s to 790s, the Tibetan Empire reached its highest glory when it ruled and controlled a territory stretching from modern-day Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Burma, China, India, Nepal, Pakistan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan.\nIn 821/822CE, Tibet and China signed a peace treaty. A bilingual account of this treaty, including details of the borders between the two countries, is inscribed on a stone pillar which stands outside the Jokhang temple in Lhasa. Tibet continued as a Central Asian empire until the mid-9th century, when a civil war over succession led to the collapse of imperial Tibet. The period that followed is known traditionally as the \"Era of Fragmentation\", when political control over Tibet became divided between regional warlords and tribes with no dominant centralized authority. An Islamic invasion from Bengal took place in 1206.\nYuan dynasty.\nThe Mongol Yuan dynasty, through the Bureau of Buddhist and Tibetan Affairs, or Xuanzheng Yuan, ruled Tibet through a top-level administrative department. One of the department's purposes was to select a \"dpon-chen\" (\"great administrator\"), usually appointed by the lama and confirmed by the Mongol emperor in Beijing. The Sakya lama retained a degree of autonomy, acting as the political authority of the region, while the \"dpon-chen\" held administrative and military power. Mongol rule of Tibet remained separate from the main provinces of China, but the region existed under the administration of the Yuan dynasty. If the Sakya lama ever came into conflict with the \"dpon-chen\", the \"dpon-chen\" had the authority to send Chinese troops into the region.\nTibet retained nominal power over religious and regional political affairs, while the Mongols managed a structural and administrative rule over the region, reinforced by the rare military intervention. This existed as a \"diarchic structure\" under the Yuan emperor, with power primarily in favor of the Mongols. Mongolian prince Khuden gained temporal power in Tibet in the 1240s and sponsored Sakya Pandita, whose seat became the capital of Tibet. Drog\u00f6n Ch\u00f6gyal Phagpa, Sakya Pandita's nephew became Imperial Preceptor of Kublai Khan, founder of the Yuan dynasty.\nYuan control over the region ended with the Ming overthrow of the Yuan and Tai Situ Changchub Gyaltsen's revolt against the Mongols. Following the uprising, Tai Situ Changchub Gyaltsen founded the Phagmodrupa dynasty, and sought to reduce Yuan influences over Tibetan culture and politics.\nPhagmodrupa, Rinpungpa and Tsangpa dynasties.\nBetween 1346 and 1354, Tai Situ Changchub Gyaltsen toppled the Sakya and founded the Phagmodrupa dynasty. The following 80 years saw the founding of the Gelug school (also known as Yellow Hats) by the disciples of Je Tsongkhapa, and the founding of the important Ganden, Drepung and Sera monasteries near Lhasa. However, internal strife within the dynasty and the strong localism of the various fiefs and political-religious factions led to a long series of internal conflicts. The minister family Rinpungpa, based in Tsang (West Central Tibet), dominated politics after 1435. In 1565 they were overthrown by the Tsangpa dynasty of Shigatse which expanded its power in different directions of Tibet in the following decades and favoured the Karma Kagyu sect.\nRise of Ganden Phodrang and Buddhist Gelug school.\nIn 1578, Altan Khan of the T\u00fcmed Mongols gave Sonam Gyatso, a high lama of the Gelugpa school, the name \"Dalai Lama\", \"Dalai\" being the Mongolian translation of the Tibetan name \"Gyatso\" \"Ocean\".\nThe 5th Dalai Lama (1617\u20131682) is known for unifying the Tibetan heartland under the control of the Gelug school of Tibetan Buddhism, after defeating the rival Kagyu and Jonang sects and the secular ruler, the Tsangpa prince, in a prolonged civil war. His efforts were successful in part because of aid from G\u00fcshi Khan, the Oirat leader of the Khoshut Khanate. With G\u00fcshi Khan as a largely uninvolved overlord, the 5th Dalai Lama and his intimates established a civil administration which is referred to by historians as the \"Lhasa state\". This Tibetan regime or government is also referred to as the Ganden Phodrang.\nQing dynasty.\nQing dynasty rule in Tibet began with their 1720 expedition to the country when they expelled the invading Dzungars. Amdo came under Qing control in 1724, and eastern Kham was incorporated into neighbouring Chinese provinces in 1728. Meanwhile, the Qing government sent resident commissioners called \"Ambans\" to Lhasa. In 1750, the Ambans and the majority of the Han Chinese and Manchus living in Lhasa were killed in a riot, and Qing troops arrived quickly and suppressed the rebels in the next year. Like the preceding Yuan dynasty, the Manchus of the Qing dynasty exerted military and administrative control of the region, while granting it a degree of political autonomy. The Qing commander publicly executed a number of supporters of the rebels and, as in 1723 and 1728, made changes in the political structure and drew up a formal organization plan. The Qing now restored the Dalai Lama as ruler, leading the governing council called \"Kashag\", but elevated the role of \"Ambans\" to include more direct involvement in Tibetan internal affairs. At the same time, the Qing took steps to counterbalance the power of the aristocracy by adding officials recruited from the clergy to key posts.\nFor several decades, peace reigned in Tibet, but in 1792, the Qing Qianlong Emperor sent a large Chinese army into Tibet to push the invading Nepalese out. This prompted yet another Qing reorganization of the Tibetan government, this time through a written plan called the \"Twenty-Nine Regulations for Better Government in Tibet\". Qing military garrisons staffed with Qing troops were now also established near the Nepalese border. Tibet was dominated by the Manchus in various stages in the 18th century, and the years immediately following the 1792 regulations were the peak of the Qing imperial commissioners' authority; but there was no attempt to make Tibet a Chinese province.\nIn 1834, the Sikh Empire invaded and annexed Ladakh, a culturally Tibetan region that was an independent kingdom at the time. Seven years later, a Sikh army led by General Zorawar Singh invaded western Tibet from Ladakh, starting the Sino-Sikh War. A Qing-Tibetan army repelled the invaders but was in turn defeated when it chased the Sikhs into Ladakh. The war ended with the signing of the Treaty of Chushul between the Chinese and Sikh empires.\nAs the Qing dynasty weakened, its authority over Tibet also gradually declined, and by the mid-19th century, its influence was minuscule. Qing authority over Tibet had become more symbolic than real by the late 19th century, although in the 1860s, the Tibetans still chose for reasons of their own to emphasize the empire's symbolic authority and make it seem substantial.\nIn 1774, a Scottish nobleman, George Bogle, travelled to Shigatse to investigate prospects of trade for the East India Company. His efforts, while largely unsuccessful, established permanent contact between Tibet and the Western world. However, in the 19th century, tensions between foreign powers and Tibet increased. The British Empire was expanding its territories in India into the Himalayas, while the Emirate of Afghanistan and the Russian Empire were both doing likewise in Central Asia.\nIn 1904, a British expedition to Tibet, spurred in part by a fear that Russia was extending its power into Tibet as part of the Great Game, was launched. Although the expedition initially set out with the stated purpose of resolving border disputes between Tibet and Sikkim, it quickly turned into a military invasion. The British expeditionary force, consisting of mostly Indian troops, quickly invaded and captured Lhasa, with the Dalai Lama fleeing to the countryside. Afterwards, the leader of the expedition, Sir Francis Younghusband, negotiated the Convention Between Great Britain and Tibet with the Tibetans, which guaranteed the British great economic influence but ensured the region remained under Chinese control. The Qing imperial resident, known as the Amban, publicly repudiated the treaty, while the British government, eager for friendly relations with China, negotiated a new treaty two years later known as the Convention Between Great Britain and China Respecting Tibet. The British agreed not to annex or interfere in Tibet in return for an indemnity from the Chinese government, while China agreed not to permit any other foreign state to interfere with the territory or internal administration of Tibet.\nIn 1910, the Qing government sent a military expedition of its own under Zhao Erfeng to establish direct Manchu-Chinese rule and, in an imperial edict, deposed the Dalai Lama, who fled to British India. Zhao Erfeng defeated the Tibetan military conclusively and expelled the Dalai Lama's forces from the province. His actions were unpopular, and there was much animosity against him for his mistreatment of civilians and disregard for local culture.\nPost-Qing period.\nAfter the Xinhai Revolution (1911\u20131912) toppled the Qing dynasty and the last Qing troops were escorted out of Tibet, the new Republic of China apologized for the actions of the Qing and offered to restore the Dalai Lama's title. The Dalai Lama refused any Chinese title and declared himself ruler of an independent Tibet. In 1913, Tibet and Outer Mongolia concluded a treaty of mutual recognition. The ROC continued to view the former Qing territory as its own, including Tibet.69 For the next 36 years, the 13th Dalai Lama and the regents who succeeded him governed Tibet. During this time, Tibet fought Chinese warlords for control of the ethnically Tibetan areas in Xikang and Qinghai (parts of Kham and Amdo) along the upper reaches of the Yangtze River. In 1914, the Tibetan government signed the Simla Convention with Britain, which recognized Chinese suzerainty over Tibet in return for a border settlement. China refused to sign the convention. Tibet continued to lack clear boundaries or international recognition of its status.69\nWhen in the 1930s and 1940s the regents displayed negligence in affairs, the Kuomintang Government of the Republic of China took advantage of this to expand its reach into the territory. On December 20, 1941, Kuomintang leader Chiang Kai-Shek noted in his diary that Tibet would be among the territories which he would demand as restitution for China following the conclusion of World War II.\nSince 1950.\nEmerging with control over most of mainland China after the Chinese Civil War, the People's Republic of China annexed Tibet in 1950 and negotiated the Seventeen Point Agreement with the newly enthroned 14th Dalai Lama's government, affirming the People's Republic of China's sovereignty but granting the area autonomy. Subsequently, on his journey into exile, the 14th Dalai Lama completely repudiated the agreement, which he has repeated on many occasions. According to the CIA, the Chinese used the Dalai Lama to gain control of the military's training and actions.\nThe Dalai Lama had a strong following as many people from Tibet looked at him not just as their political leader, but as their spiritual leader. After the Dalai Lama's government fled to Dharamsala, India, during the 1959 Tibetan Rebellion, it established a rival government-in-exile. Afterwards, the Central People's Government in Beijing renounced the agreement and began implementation of the halted social and political reforms. During the Great Leap Forward, over 200,000 Tibetans may have died and approximately 6,000 monasteries were destroyed during the Cultural Revolution\u2014destroying the vast majority of historic Tibetan architecture.\nIn 1980, General Secretary and reformist Hu Yaobang visited Tibet and ushered in a period of social, political, and economic liberalization. At the end of the decade, however, before the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989, monks in the Drepung and Sera monasteries started protesting for independence. The government halted reforms and started an anti-separatist campaign. Human rights organisations have been critical of the Beijing and Lhasa governments' approach to human rights in the region when cracking down on separatist convulsions that have occurred around monasteries and cities, most recently in the 2008 Tibetan unrest.\nThe central region of Tibet is now an autonomous region within China, the Tibet Autonomous Region. The Tibet Autonomous Region is a province-level entity of the People's Republic of China. It is governed by a People's Government, led by a chairman. In practice, however, the chairman is subordinate to the branch secretary of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). In 2010, it was reported that, as a matter of convention, the chairman had almost always been an ethnic Tibetan, while the party secretary had always been ethnically non-Tibetan.\nGeography.\nAll of modern China, including Tibet, is considered a part of East Asia.\nMountains and rivers.\nTibet has some of the world's tallest mountains, with several of them making the top ten list. Mount Everest, located on the border with Nepal, is, at , the highest mountain on earth. Several major rivers have their source in the Tibetan Plateau (mostly in present-day Qinghai Province). These include the Yangtze, Yellow River, Indus River, Mekong, Ganges, Salween and the Yarlung Tsangpo River (Brahmaputra River). The Yarlung Tsangpo Grand Canyon, along the Yarlung Tsangpo River, is among the deepest and longest canyons in the world.\nTibet has been called the \"Water Tower\" of Asia, and China is investing heavily in water projects in Tibet.\nThe Indus and Brahmaputra rivers originate from the vicinities of Lake Mapam Yumco in Western Tibet, near Mount Kailash. The mountain is a holy pilgrimage site for both Hindus and Tibetans. The Hindus consider the mountain to be the abode of Lord Shiva. The Tibetan name for Mount Kailash is Khang Rinpoche. Tibet has numerous high-altitude lakes referred to in Tibetan as \"tso\" or \"co\". These include Qinghai Lake, Lake Manasarovar, Namtso, Pangong Tso, Yamdrok Lake, Siling Co, Lhamo La-tso, Lumajangdong Co, Lake Puma Yumco, Lake Paiku, Como Chamling, Lake Rakshastal, Dagze Co and Dong Co. The Qinghai Lake (Koko Nor) is the largest lake in the People's Republic of China.\nClimate.\nThe climate is severely dry nine months of the year, and average annual snowfall is only , due to the rain shadow effect. Western passes receive small amounts of fresh snow each year but remain traversible all year round. Low temperatures are prevalent throughout these western regions, where bleak desolation is unrelieved by any vegetation bigger than a low bush, and where the wind sweeps unchecked across vast expanses of arid plain. The Indian monsoon exerts some influence on eastern Tibet. Northern Tibet is subject to high temperatures in the summer and intense cold in the winter.\nWildlife.\n\"Sus scrofa\" expanded from its origin in southeast Asia into the Plateau, acquiring and fixing adaptive alleles for the high-altitude environment. The forests of Tibet are home to black bears, red pandas, musk deer, barking deer, and squirrels. Monkeys such as rhesus macaques and langurs live in the warmer forest zones. Tibetan antelopes, gazelles, and kiangs gaze on the grasslands of the Tibetan plateau. There are more than 500 bird species in Tibet. Because of the high altitude and harsh climate, there are few insects in Tibet.\nSnow leopards are hunted for their fur and the eggs of black-necked cranes have been collected as a delicacy food.\nRegions.\nCultural Tibet consists of several regions. These include Amdo (\"A mdo\") in the northeast, which is administratively part of the provinces of Qinghai, Gansu, and Sichuan. Kham (\"Khams\") in the southeast encompasses parts of western Sichuan, northern Yunnan, southern Qinghai, and the eastern part of the Tibet Autonomous Region. \u00dc-Tsang (\"dBus gTsang\") (\u00dc in the center, Tsang in the center-west, and Ngari (\"mNga' ris\") in the far west) covered the central and western portion of Tibet Autonomous Region.\nTibetan cultural influences extend to the neighboring states of Bhutan, Nepal, regions of India such as Sikkim, Ladakh, Lahaul, and Spiti, Northern Pakistan Baltistan or Balti-yul in addition to designated Tibetan autonomous areas in adjacent Chinese provinces.\nCities, towns and villages.\nThere are over 800 settlements in Tibet. Lhasa is Tibet's traditional capital and the capital of Tibet Autonomous Region. It contains two world heritage sites\u00a0\u2013 the Potala Palace and Norbulingka, which were the residences of the Dalai Lama. Lhasa contains a number of significant temples and monasteries, including Jokhang and Ramoche Temple.\nShigatse is the second largest city in the Tibet AR, west of Lhasa. Gyantse and Qamdo are also amongst the largest.\nOther cities and towns in cultural Tibet include Shiquanhe (Gar), Nagchu, Bamda, Rutog, Nyingchi, Nedong, Coq\u00ean, Barkam, Sagya, Gertse, Pelbar, Lhatse, and Tingri; in Sichuan, Kangding (Dartsedo); in Qinghai, Jyekundo (Yushu), Machen, and Golmud; in India, Tawang, Leh, and Gangtok, and in Pakistan, Skardu, Kharmang, and Khaplu.\nEconomy.\nThe Tibetan economy is dominated by subsistence agriculture. Due to limited arable land, the primary occupation of the Tibetan Plateau is raising livestock, such as sheep, cattle, goats, camels, yaks, dzo, and horses.\nThe main crops grown are barley, wheat, buckwheat, rye, potatoes, and assorted fruits and vegetables. Tibet is ranked the lowest among China's 31 provinces on the Human Development Index according to UN Development Programme data. In recent years, due to increased interest in Tibetan Buddhism, tourism has become an increasingly important sector, and is actively promoted by the authorities. Tourism brings in the most income from the sale of handicrafts. These include Tibetan hats, jewelry (silver and gold), wooden items, clothing, quilts, fabrics, Tibetan rugs and carpets. The Central People's Government exempts Tibet from all taxation and provides 90% of Tibet's government expenditures. However, most of this investment goes to pay migrant workers who do not settle in Tibet and send much of their income home to other provinces.\nForty percent of the rural cash income in the Tibet Autonomous Region is derived from the harvesting of the fungus \"Ophiocordyceps sinensis\" (formerly \"Cordyceps sinensis\"); contributing at least 1.8\u00a0billion yuan, (US$225\u00a0million) to the region's GDP.\nThe Qingzang railway linking the Tibet Autonomous Region to Qinghai Province was opened in 2006, but it was controversial.\nIn January 2007, the Chinese government issued a report outlining the discovery of a large mineral deposit under the Tibetan Plateau. The deposit has an estimated value of $128\u00a0billion and may double Chinese reserves of zinc, copper, and lead. The Chinese government sees this as a way to alleviate the nation's dependence on foreign mineral imports for its growing economy. However, critics worry that mining these vast resources will harm Tibet's fragile ecosystem and undermine Tibetan culture.\nOn January 15, 2009, China announced the construction of Tibet's first expressway, the Lhasa Airport Expressway, a stretch of controlled-access highway in southwestern Lhasa. The project will cost 1.55\u00a0billion yuan (US$227\u00a0million).\nFrom January 18\u201320, 2010, a national conference on Tibet and areas inhabited by Tibetans in Sichuan, Yunnan, Gansu and Qinghai was held in China and a plan to improve development of the areas was announced. The conference was attended by General secretary Hu Jintao, Wu Bangguo, Wen Jiabao, Jia Qinglin, Li Changchun, Xi Jinping, Li Keqiang, He Guoqiang and Zhou Yongkang, all members of Politburo Standing Committee of the Chinese Communist Party. The plan called for improvement of rural Tibetan income to national standards by 2020 and free education for all rural Tibetan children. China has invested 310\u00a0billion yuan (about 45.6\u00a0billion U.S. dollars) in Tibet since 2001.\nDevelopment zone.\nThe State Council approved Tibet Lhasa Economic and Technological Development Zone as a state-level development zone in 2001. It is located in the western suburbs of Lhasa, the capital of the Tibet Autonomous Region. It is away from the Gonggar Airport, and away from Lhasa Railway Station and away from 318 national highway.\nThe zone has a planned area of and is divided into two zones. Zone A developed a land area of for construction purposes. It is a flat zone, and has the natural conditions for good drainage.\nDemographics.\nHistorically, the population of Tibet consisted of primarily ethnic Tibetans and some other ethnic groups. According to tradition the original ancestors of the Tibetan people, as represented by the six red bands in the Tibetan flag, are: the Se, Mu, Dong, Tong, Dru and Ra. Other traditional ethnic groups with significant population or with the majority of the ethnic group residing in Tibet (excluding a disputed area with India) include Bai people, Blang, Bonan, Dongxiang, Han, Hui people, Lhoba, Lisu people, Miao, Mongols, Monguor (Tu people), Menba (Monpa), Mosuo, Nakhi, Qiang, Nu people, Pumi, Salar, and Yi people.\nThe proportion of the non-Tibetan population in Tibet is disputed. On the one hand, the Central Tibetan Administration of the Dalai Lama accuses China of actively swamping Tibet with migrants in order to alter Tibet's demographic makeup. On the other hand, according to the 2010 Chinese census ethnic Tibetans comprise 90% of a total population of 3\u00a0million in the Tibet Autonomous Region.\nCulture.\nReligion.\nBuddhism.\nReligion is extremely important to the Tibetans and has a strong influence over all aspects of their lives. B\u00f6n is the indigenous religion of Tibet, but has been almost eclipsed by Tibetan Buddhism, a distinctive form of Mahayana and Vajrayana, which was introduced into Tibet from the Sanskrit Buddhist tradition of northern India. Tibetan Buddhism is practiced not only in Tibet but also in Mongolia, parts of northern India, the Buryat Republic, the Tuva Republic, and in the Republic of Kalmykia and some other parts of China. During China's Cultural Revolution, nearly all Tibet's monasteries were ransacked and destroyed by the Red Guards. A few monasteries have begun to rebuild since the 1980s (with limited support from the Chinese government) and greater religious freedom has been granted\u00a0\u2013 although it is still limited. Monks returned to monasteries across Tibet and monastic education resumed even though the number of monks imposed is strictly limited. Before the 1950s, between 10 and 20% of males in Tibet were monks.\nTibetan Buddhism has five main traditions (the suffix \"pa\" is comparable to \"er\" in English):\nThe Chinese government continued to pursue a strategy of forced assimilation and suppression of Tibetan Buddhism, as demonstrated by the laws designed to control the next reincarnation of the Dalai Lama and those of other Tibetan eminent lamas. Monks and nuns who refused to denounce the Dalai Lama have been expelled from their monasteries, imprisoned, and tortured.\nIt was reported in June 2021 that amidst the 2020\u20132022 China\u2013India skirmishes, the People's Liberation Army had been forming a new unit for Tibetans who would be taken to Buddhist monks for religious blessings after completing their training.\nChristianity.\nThe first Christians documented to have reached Tibet were the Nestorians, of whom various remains and inscriptions have been found in Tibet. They were also present at the imperial camp of M\u00f6ngke Khan at Shira Ordo, where they debated in 1256 with Karma Pakshi (1204/6-83), head of the Karma Kagyu order. Desideri, who reached Lhasa in 1716, encountered Armenian and Russian merchants.\nRoman Catholic Jesuits and Capuchins arrived from Europe in the 17th and 18th centuries. Portuguese missionaries Jesuit Father Ant\u00f3nio de Andrade and Brother Manuel Marques first reached the kingdom of Gelu in western Tibet in 1624 and were welcomed by the royal family, who allowed them to build a church later on. By 1627, there were about a hundred local converts in the Guge kingdom. Later on, Christianity was introduced to Rudok, Ladakh and Tsang and was welcomed by the ruler of the Tsang kingdom, where Andrade and his fellows established a Jesuit outpost at Shigatse in 1626.\nIn 1661 another Jesuit, Johann Grueber, crossed Tibet from Sining to Lhasa (where he spent a month), before heading on to Nepal. He was followed by others who actually built a church in Lhasa. These included the Jesuit Father Ippolito Desideri, 1716\u20131721, who gained a deep knowledge of Tibetan culture, language and Buddhism, and various Capuchins in 1707\u20131711, 1716\u20131733 and 1741\u20131745, Christianity was used by some Tibetan monarchs and their courts and the Karmapa sect lamas to counterbalance the influence of the Gelugpa sect in the 17th century until in 1745 when all the missionaries were expelled at the lama's insistence.\nIn 1877, the Protestant James Cameron from the China Inland Mission walked from Chongqing to Batang in Garz\u00ea Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, Sichuan province, and \"brought the Gospel to the Tibetan people.\" Beginning in the 20th century, in D\u00eaq\u00ean Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture in Yunnan, a large number of Lisu people and some Yi and Nu people converted to Christianity. Famous earlier missionaries include James O. Fraser, Alfred James Broomhall and Isobel Kuhn of the China Inland Mission, among others who were active in this area.\nProselytising has been illegal in China since 1949. But as of 2013[ [update]], many Christian missionaries were reported to be active in Tibet with the tacit approval of Chinese authorities, who view the missionaries as a counterforce to Tibetan Buddhism or as a boon to the local economy.\nIslam.\nMuslims have been living in Tibet since as early as the 8th or 9th century. In Tibetan cities, there are small communities of Muslims, known as Kachee (Kache), who trace their origin to immigrants from three main regions: Kashmir (Kachee Yul in ancient Tibetan), Ladakh and the Central Asian Turkic countries. Islamic influence in Tibet also came from Persia. A Muslim Sufi Syed Ali Hamdani preached to the people of Baltistan, then known as little Tibet. After 1959, a group of Tibetan Muslims made a case for Indian nationality based on their historic roots to Kashmir and the Indian government declared all Tibetan Muslims Indian citizens later on that year. Other Muslim ethnic groups who have long inhabited Tibet include Hui, Salar, Dongxiang and Bonan. There is also a well established Chinese Muslim community (gya kachee), which traces its ancestry back to the Hui ethnic group of China.\nTibetan art.\nTibetan representations of art are intrinsically bound with Tibetan Buddhism and commonly depict deities or variations of Buddha in various forms from bronze Buddhist statues and shrines, to highly colorful thangka paintings and mandalas. Thangkas are Tibet's traditional cloth paintings. Rendered on cotton cloth with a thin rod at the top, they portray Buddhist deities or themes in color and detail.\nArchitecture.\nTibetan architecture contains Chinese and Indian influences, and reflects a deeply Buddhist approach. The Buddhist wheel, along with two dragons, can be seen on nearly every Gompa in Tibet. The design of the Tibetan Ch\u00f6rtens can vary, from roundish walls in Kham to squarish, four-sided walls in Ladakh.\nThe most distinctive feature of Tibetan architecture is that many of the houses and monasteries are built on elevated, sunny sites facing the south, and are often made out of a mixture of rocks, wood, cement and earth. Little fuel is available for heat or lighting, so flat roofs are built to conserve heat, and multiple windows are constructed to let in sunlight. Walls are usually sloped inwards at 10 degrees as a precaution against the frequent earthquakes in this mountainous area.\nStanding at in height and in width, the Potala Palace is the most important example of Tibetan architecture. Formerly the residence of the Dalai Lama, it contains over one thousand rooms within thirteen stories, and houses portraits of the past Dalai Lamas and statues of the Buddha. It is divided between the outer White Palace, which serves as the administrative quarters, and the inner Red Quarters, which houses the assembly hall of the Lamas, chapels, 10,000 shrines, and a vast library of Buddhist scriptures. The Potala Palace is a World Heritage Site, as is Norbulingka, the former summer residence of the Dalai Lama.\nMusic.\nThe music of Tibet reflects the cultural heritage of the trans-Himalayan region, centered in Tibet but also known wherever ethnic Tibetan groups are found in India, Bhutan, Nepal and further abroad. First and foremost Tibetan music is religious music, reflecting the profound influence of Tibetan Buddhism on the culture.\nTibetan music often involves chanting in Tibetan or Sanskrit, as an integral part of the religion. These chants are complex, often recitations of sacred texts or in celebration of various festivals. Yang chanting, performed without metrical timing, is accompanied by resonant drums and low, sustained syllables. Other styles include those unique to the various schools of Tibetan Buddhism, such as the classical music of the popular Gelugpa school, and the romantic music of the Nyingmapa, Sakyapa and Kagyupa schools.\nNangma dance music is especially popular in the karaoke bars of the urban center of Tibet, Lhasa. Another form of popular music is the classical gar style, which is performed at rituals and ceremonies. Lu are a type of songs that feature glottal vibrations and high pitches. There are also epic bards who sing of Gesar, who is a hero to ethnic Tibetans.\nFestivals.\nTibet has various festivals, many for worshipping the Buddha, that take place throughout the year. Losar is the Tibetan New Year Festival. Preparations for the festive event are manifested by special offerings to family shrine deities, painted doors with religious symbols, and other painstaking jobs done to prepare for the event. Tibetans eat \"Guthuk\" (barley noodle soup with filling) on New Year's Eve with their families. The Monlam Prayer Festival follows it in the first month of the Tibetan calendar, falling between the fourth and the eleventh days of the first Tibetan month. It involves dancing and participating in sports events, as well as sharing picnics. The event was established in 1049 by Tsong Khapa, the founder of the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Lama's order.\nCuisine.\nThe most important crop in Tibet is barley, and dough made from barley flour\u2014called tsampa\u2014is the staple food of Tibet. This is either rolled into noodles or made into steamed dumplings called momos. Meat dishes are likely to be yak, goat, or mutton, often dried, or cooked into a spicy stew with potatoes. Mustard seed is cultivated in Tibet, and therefore features heavily in its cuisine. Yak yogurt, butter and cheese are frequently eaten, and well-prepared yogurt is considered something of a prestige item. Butter tea is a very popular drink.\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Created by writer Gardner Fox and artist Harry Lampert, the original Flash first appeared in \"Flash Comics\" #1 (cover-dated January 1940, released November 1939). Nicknamed \"the Scarlet Speedster\", all incarnations of the Flash possess \"superspeed\", which includes the ability to run, move, and think extremely fast, use superhuman reflexes, and seemingly violate certain laws of physics.\nThus far, at least five different characters \u2013each of whom somehow gained the power of \"the Speed Force\"\u2013 have assumed the mantle of the Flash in DC's history: college athlete Jay Garrick (1940\u20131951, 1961\u20132011, 2017\u2013present), forensic scientist Barry Allen (1956\u20131985, 2008\u2013present), Barry's nephew Wally West (1986\u20132011, 2016\u2013present), Barry's grandson Bart Allen (2006\u20132007), and Chinese-American Avery Ho (2017\u2013present). Each incarnation of the Flash has been a key member of at least one of DC's premier teams: the Justice Society of America, the Justice League, and the Teen Titans.\nThe Flash is one of DC Comics' most popular characters and has been integral to the publisher's many reality-changing \"crisis\" storylines over the years. The original meeting of the Golden Age Flash Jay Garrick and Silver Age Flash Barry Allen in \"Flash of Two Worlds\" (1961) introduced the Multiverse storytelling concept to DC readers, which would become the basis for many DC stories in the future.\nLike his Justice League colleagues Wonder Woman, Superman and Batman, the Flash has a distinctive cast of adversaries, including Gorilla Grodd, the various Rogues (unique among DC supervillains for their code of honor), and the various psychotic \"speedsters\" who go by the names Reverse-Flash or Zoom. Other supporting characters in \"Flash\" stories include Barry's wife, Iris West; Wally's wife, Linda Park; Bart's girlfriend, Valerie Perez; friendly fellow speedster, Max Mercury; and Central City police department members, David Singh and Patty Spivot.\nA staple of the comic book DC Universe, the Flash has been adapted to numerous DC films, video games, animated series, and live-action television shows. In live-action, Barry Allen has been portrayed by Rod Haase in the 1979 television special \"Legends of the Superheroes\", John Wesley Shipp in the 1990 \"The Flash\" series and Grant Gustin in the 2014 \"The Flash\" series, and Ezra Miller in the DC Extended Universe series of films, beginning with ' (2016). Shipp also portrays a version of Jay Garrick in the 2014 \"The Flash\" series. The various incarnations of the Flash are also features in animated series such as ', \"Justice League\", \"\" and \"Young Justice\", and the DC Universe Animated Original Movies series.\nPublication history.\nGolden Age.\nThe Flash first appeared in the Golden Age \"Flash Comics\" #1 (January 1940), from All-American Publications, one of three companies that would eventually merge to form DC Comics. Created by writer Gardner Fox and artist Harry Lampert, this Flash was Jay Garrick, a college student who gained his speed through the inhalation of hard water vapors. When re-introduced in the 1960s Garrick's origin was modified slightly, gaining his powers through exposure to heavy water.\nJay Garrick was a popular character in the 1940s, supporting both \"Flash Comics\" and \"All-Flash Quarterly\" (later published bi-monthly as simply \"All-Flash\"); co-starring in \"Comic Cavalcade\"; and being a charter member of the Justice Society of America, the first superhero team, whose adventures ran in \"All Star Comics\". With superheroes' post-war decline in popularity, \"Flash Comics\" was canceled with issue #104 (1949) which featured an evil version of the Flash called the Rival. The Justice Society's final Golden Age story ran in \"All Star Comics\" #57 (1951; the title itself continued as \"All Star Western\").\nSilver Age.\nIn 1956, DC Comics successfully revived superheroes, ushering in what became known as the Silver Age of comic books. Rather than bringing back the same Golden Age heroes, DC rethought them as new characters for the modern age. The Flash was the first revival, in the tryout comic book \"Showcase\" #4 (October 1956).\nThis new Flash was Barry Allen, a police scientist who gained super-speed when bathed by chemicals after a shelf of them was struck by lightning. He adopted the name \"The Scarlet Speedster\" after reading a comic book featuring the Golden Age Flash. After several more appearances in \"Showcase\", Allen's character was given his own title, \"The Flash\", the first issue of which was #105 (resuming where \"Flash Comics\" had left off). Barry Allen and the new Flash were created by writers Robert Kanigher and John Broome and cartoonist Carmine Infantino.\nThe Silver Age Flash proved popular enough that several other Golden Age heroes were revived in new incarnations (see: Green Lantern). A new superhero team, the Justice League of America, was also created, with the Flash as a main, charter member.\nBarry Allen's title also introduced a much-imitated plot device into superhero comics when it was revealed that Garrick and Allen existed on fictional parallel worlds. Their powers allowed them to cross the dimensional boundary between worlds, and the men became good friends. \"Flash of Two Worlds\" (\"The Flash\" #123) was the first crossover in which a Golden Age character met a Silver Age character. Soon, there were crossovers between the entire Justice League and the Justice Society; their respective teams began an annual get-together which endured from the early 1960s until the mid-1980s.\nAllen's adventures continued in his own title until the event of \"Crisis on Infinite Earths\". \"The Flash\" ended as a series with issue #350. Allen's life had become considerably confused in the early 1980s, and DC elected to end his adventures and pass the mantle on to another character. Allen died heroically in \"Crisis on Infinite Earths\" #8 (1985). Thanks to his ability to travel through time, he would continue to appear occasionally in the years to come.\nModern Age.\nThe third Flash was Wally West, introduced in \"The Flash\" #110 (December 1959) as Kid Flash. West, Allen's nephew by marriage, gained the Flash's powers through an accident identical to Allen's. Adopting the identity of Kid Flash, he maintained membership in the Teen Titans for years. Following Allen's death, West adopted the Flash identity in \"Crisis on Infinite Earths\" #12 and was given his own series, beginning with \"The Flash\" (vol. 2) #1 in 1987. Many issues began with the catchphrase: \"My name is Wally West. I'm the fastest man alive.\"\nDue to the \"Infinite Crisis\" miniseries and the \"One Year Later\" jump in time in the DC Universe, DC canceled \"The Flash\" (vol. 2) in January 2006 at #230. A new series, \"The Flash: The Fastest Man Alive\", began on June 21, 2006. The initial story arc of this series, written by Danny Bilson and Paul De Meo with art by Ken Lashley, focused on Bart Allen's acceptance of the role of the Flash.\n\"Flash: Fastest Man Alive\" was canceled with issue #13. In its place \"The Flash\" (vol. 2) was revived with issue #231, with Mark Waid as the initial writer. Waid also wrote \"All-Flash\" #1, which acted as the bridge between the two series. DC had solicited \"The Flash: The Fastest Man Alive\" through issue #15. \"All Flash\" #1 replaced issue #14 and \"The Flash\" (vol. 2) #231 replaced issue #15 in title and interior creative team only. The covers and cover artists were as solicited by DC, and the information text released was devoid of any plot information.\nIn 2009, Barry Allen made a full-fledged return to the DCU-proper in \"\", a six-issue miniseries by Geoff Johns and Ethan Van Sciver.\nFictional character biographies.\nWhile several other individuals have used the name Flash, these have either on parallel worlds or in the future. Jay Garrick, Barry Allen, and Wally West are the best-known exemplars of the identity.\nThe signature wingdings are never absent.\nJay Garrick.\nJay Garrick was a college student in 1938 who accidentally inhaled heavy water vapors after taking a smoke break inside his laboratory where he had been working. As a result, he found that he could run at superhuman speed and had similarly fast reflexes. After a brief career as a college football star, he donned a red shirt with a lightning bolt and a stylized metal helmet with wings (based on images of the Greek deity Hermes), and began to fight crime as the Flash. His first case involved battling the \"Faultless Four\", a group of blackmailers. Garrick kept his identity secret for years without a mask by continually vibrating his body while in public so that any photograph of his face would be blurred. Although originally from Earth-Two, he was incorporated into the history of New Earth following the \"Crisis on Infinite Earths\" and is still active as the Flash operating out of Keystone City. He is a member of the Justice Society.\nBarry Allen.\nBarry Allen is an assistant scientist from the Criminal and Forensic Science Division of Central City Police Department. Barry had a reputation for being very slow, deliberate, and frequently late, which frustrated his fianc\u00e9e, Iris West. One night, as he was preparing to leave work, a freak lightning bolt struck a nearby shelf in his lab and doused him with a cocktail of unnamed chemicals. As a result, Barry found that he could run extremely fast and had matching reflexes. He donned a set of red tights sporting a lightning bolt (reminiscent of the original Fawcett Comics Captain Marvel), dubbed himself the Flash (after his childhood hero, Jay Garrick), and became a crimefighter active in Central City. In his civilian identity, he stores the costume compressed in a special ring via the use of a special gas that could compress cloth fibers to a small fraction of their normal size.\nBarry sacrificed himself to save the universe in the 1985 maxi-series \"Crisis on Infinite Earths\" and remained dead for over twenty years after that story's publication. With the 2008 series \"Final Crisis\", Barry returned to the DC Universe and returned to full prominence as the Flash in the 2009 series \"\", which was soon after followed by a new volume of \"The Flash\" ongoing series, where Barry's adventures as the Scarlet Speedster were published until 2020. Wally returned as the primary Flash after 2021, but Barry remains a supporting character to him and the larger DC Universe and still operates as the Flash as of 2024.\nWally West.\nWallace Rudolph \"Wally\" West is the nephew of both Iris West and Barry Allen, by marriage, and was introduced in \"The Flash\" #110 (1959). When West was about ten years old, he was visiting his uncle's police laboratory, and the freak accident that gave Allen his powers repeated itself, bathing West in electrically charged chemicals. Now possessing the same powers as his uncle, West donned a copy of his uncle's outfit and became the young, crime fighter, Kid Flash. After the events of \"Crisis on Infinite Earths\" where Barry Allen was killed, Wally took over as the fastest man alive. Following the events of \"Infinite Crisis\", Wally, his wife Linda, and their twins left Earth for an unknown dimension.\nWally, his wife, and their twins were pulled back from the Speed Force by the Legion of Super-Heroes at the conclusion of \"The Lightning Saga\". This set the stage for Wally West's return as the Flash after the events of \"The Flash: Fastest Man Alive\" #13 (see Bart Allen), in \"All Flash\" #1, and with \"The Flash\" (vol. 2) series, which resumed with issue #231 in August 2007. It subsequently ends with issue #247, and West, along with all the other \"Flash\" characters, play a large role in 2009's \"\". After the New 52 reboot, Wally was removed from DC continuity but returned during DC Rebirth using a new red and silver costume, to a world that had forgotten his existence due to a combination of Barry and Dr. Manhattan meddling with reality during Flashpoint and the villain Abra Kadabra wiping the memory of Wally's existence. After Manhattan undid the meddling he'd caused to reality, Wally was restored to the timeline and his family eventually returned as well. Barry returned the mantle of the primary Flash to Wally after Barry elected to join the multiverse-travelling team Justice Incarnate. Wally's return as the main character of \"The Flash\" series began in \"The Flash\" #771 (2021) and is still the main Flash as of 2024.\nBart Allen.\nBartholomew Henry \"Bart\" Allen II is the grandson of Barry Allen and his wife Iris. Bart suffered from accelerated aging and, as a result, was raised in a virtual reality machine until Iris took him back in time to get help from the then-current Flash, Wally West. With Wally's help, Bart's aging slowed, and he took the name Impulse. After Deathstroke shoots him in the knee, Bart changes both his attitude and his costume, taking the mantle of Kid Flash. During the events of \"Infinite Crisis\", the Speed Force vanished, taking with it all the speedsters save Jay Garrick. Bart returned, four years older, and for a year claimed that he lost his powers. However, the Speed Force had not disappeared completely, but had been absorbed into Bart's body; essentially, he now contained all of the Speed Force.\nBart's costume as the Flash was a clone of his grandfather's, similarly stylized to Wally West's. Not long after taking the mantle of the Flash, Bart was killed by the Rogues in the thirteenth (and final) issue of \"The Flash: The Fastest Man Alive\". However, he was later resurrected in the 31st century in ' #3 by Brainiac 5 to combat Superboy-Prime and the Legion of Super-Villains. Bart returned to the past and played a large role in '.\nAvery Ho.\nAvery Ho gained her powers as a teenager living in Central City in a \"Speed Force Storm\" that granted her a connection to the Speed Force. Avery was trained to use her powers by Barry, Meena Dewan/Negative Flash, and August Heart/Godspeed, though when it was discovered Heart was stealing the speed of Speed Force-connected Central City residents, Barry and Ace West/Kid Flash set out to remove the connected residents' connection to the Speed Force, but were attacked by Godspeed before they could remove Avery's. Although they defeated Godspeed, Avery retained her connection to the Speed Force and her powers. She has gone on to become a member of The Justice League of China (a team she joined to retain her Flash moniker and her Chinese-American heritage), the multi-verse team the Justice Incarnate, and the Flash Family, becoming the love interest of Ace West, the duo serving as the main characters of the ongoing series \"Speed Force\".\nOthers.\nJesse Chambers.\nDaughter of the speedster Johnny Quick, Jesse Chambers becomes a speeding superhero like her father. She later meets Wally West, the Flash, who asks her to be his replacement if something were to happen to him (as part of an elaborate plan on his part, trying to force Bart Allen to take his role in the legacy of the Flash more seriously). She briefly assumes the mantle of the Flash, after Wally enters the Speed Force.\nJess Chambers.\nJess Chambers was originally known as Kid Quick, the non-binary sidekick to Earth-11's Jesse Quick, and a member of the team Teen Justice. In the Future State event, Chambers would permanently relocate to Earth-0, taking on the mantle of the Flash and joining the Justice League.\nJudy Garrick.\nJudy Garrick is the daughter of the original Flash, Jay Garrick, first known as the Boom. As a teenager, she was abducted from the timestream by the Childminder, a Mother Goose-like being who took many Golden Age sidekicks to be sold. Judy and the rest of the Lost Children were freed by Stargirl and Red Arrow, re-entering the timestream in the present day and reuniting with her father. Years later, Judy would take on the mantle of the Flash and join the Justice Society of America.\nJohn Fox.\nJohn Fox was a historian for the National Academy of Science in Central City in the 27th Century. He was sent back in time to get the help of one or more of the three Flashes (Garrick, Allen, West), in order to defeat the radioactive villain Mota back in Fox's own time period. Each Flash had individually fought Mota over the course of several years in the 20th century. Fox's mission was a failure, but during his return trip, the tachyon radiation that sent him through the time stream gave him superhuman speed. He defeated Mota as a new iteration of the Flash and operated as his century's Flash for a time. Shortly after, he moved to the 853rd century and joined \"Justice Legion A\" (also known as Justice Legion Alpha) as seen in the DC One Million series of books.\nThe name \"John Fox\" is combined from the names of seminal comic book writers John Broome, who co-created the Barry Allen and Wally West Flashes, and Gardner Fox, who co-created the Jay Garrick Flash.\nUnnamed Allen of the 23rd century.\nThe father of Sela Allen, his wife and daughter were captured by Cobalt Blue. He is forced to watch his wife die and his daughter become crippled. As he and Max Mercury kill Cobalt Blue, a child takes Cobalt Blue's power gem and kills Allen. This Flash is one of the two destined Flashes to be killed by Cobalt Blue.\nSela Allen.\nSela Allen is an ordinary human in the 23rd century until Cobalt Blue steals electrical impulses away from her, causing her to become as slow to the world as the world is to the Flash. Hoping to restore her, her father takes her into the Speed Force. When her father is killed, she appears as a living manifestation of the Speed Force, able to lend speed to various people and objects, but unable to physically interact with the world.\nBlaine Allen.\nBlaine Allen and his son live on the colony world of Petrus in the 28th century. In an attempt to end the Allen blood line, Cobalt Blue injects Allen's son Jace with a virus. Lacking super speed, Jace was unable to shake off the virus. In despair, Blaine takes his son to the Speed Force in the hopes that it would accept him. It takes Blaine instead and grants superspeed to Jace so that he can shake off the sickness.\nJace Allen.\nJace Allen gains superspeed when his father brings him into the Speed Force to attempt to cure him of a virus injected into his body by Cobalt Blue in an attempt to end the Allen bloodline. In memory of his father, Jace assumes the mantle of the Flash and continues the feud against Cobalt Blue.\nKryiad.\nAfter an alien creature invades Earth, a history buff named Kriyad travels back in time from the 98th century to acquire a Green Lantern power ring (\"The Flash\" #309, May 1982). He fails, so he tries to capture the Flash's speed instead. After being beaten by Barry Allen, he travels back further in time and uses the chemicals from the clothes Barry Allen was wearing when he gained his powers to give himself super speed. Returning to his own time, Kryiad sacrifices his life to defeat the alien creature.\nBizarro Flash.\nBizarro-Flash was created when Bizarro cloned Flash. He had a costume the reverse colors of Flash's, however he had a mallet symbol because Flash was holding one when he was cloned. The modern version of Bizarro Flash has the symbol of a thunderbolt-shaped mustard stain. He has the powers of the Flash but he is completely intangible.\nPowers and abilities.\nAll incarnations of the Flash can move, think, and react at light speeds as well as having superhuman endurance that allows them to run incredible distances. Some, notably later versions, can vibrate so fast that they can pass through walls in a process called quantum tunneling, travel through time and can also lend and borrow speed. Speedsters can also heal more rapidly than an average human. In addition, most incarnations have an invisible aura around their respective bodies that protects them from air friction and the kinetic effects of their powers.\nOn several occasions, the Flash has raced against Superman, either to determine who is faster or as part of a mutual effort to thwart some type of threat; these races, however, often result in ties because of outside circumstances. Writer Jim Shooter and artist Curt Swan crafted the story \"Superman's Race with the Flash!\" in \"Superman\" #199 (August 1967), which featured the first race between the Flash and Superman. Writer E. Nelson Bridwell and artist Ross Andru produced \"The Race to the End of the Universe\", a follow-up story four months later in \"The Flash\" #175 (December 1967). However, after the DC Universe revision after \"Crisis on Infinite Earths\", the Flash does successfully beat Superman in a race in \"The Adventures of Superman\" #463, with the explanation that Superman is not accustomed to running at high speed for extended periods of time since flying is more versatile and less strenuous, which means the far more practiced Flash has the advantage. After Final Crisis in , the Flash is shown as being significantly faster than Superman, able to outrun him as Superman struggles to keep up with him. He reveals that all the close races between them before had been \"for charity\". In the \"Smallville\" episode \"Run,\" the Flash (Bart Allen) effortlessly matches pre-Superman Clark Kent's top speed while running backward; and when running seriously, he instantly outruns Clark and disappears from his view beyond the horizon.\nWhile various incarnations of the Flash have proven their ability to run at light speed, the ability to steal speed from other objects allows respective Flashes to even significantly surpass this velocity. In \"Flash: The Human Race\", Wally is shown absorbing kinetic energy, to an extent enabling him to move faster than teleportation and run from the end of the universe back to earth in less than a Planck instant.\nSpeedsters may at times use the ability to speed-read at incredible rates and in doing so, process vast amounts of information. Whatever knowledge they acquire in this manner is usually temporary. Their ability to think fast also allows them some immunity to telepathy, as their thoughts operate at a rate too rapid for telepaths such as Martian Manhunter or Gorilla Grodd to read or influence their minds.\nFlashes and other super-speedsters also have the ability to speak to one another at a highly accelerated rate. This is often done to have private conversations in front of non-fast people (as when Flash speaks to Superman about his ability to serve both the Titans and the JLA in \"The Titans\" #2). Speed-talking is also sometimes used for comedic effect where Flash becomes so excited that he begins talking faster and faster until his words become a jumble of noise. He also has the ability to change the vibration of his vocal cords making it so he can change how his voice sounds to others.\nWhile not having the physical strength of many of his comrades and enemies, Flash has shown to be able to use his speed to exert incredible momentum into physical attacks. In , Flash uses these kinds of attacks as many of his special moves.\nThe Flash has also claimed that he can process thoughts in less than an attosecond. At times he is able to throw lightning created by his super speed and make speed vortices.\nSome flashes also have the ability to create speed avatars (i.e. duplicates) and these avatars have sometimes been sent to different timelines to complete a particular mission. (Barry Allen exhibits this ability in the live action series \"The Flash\").\nHe can also be seen negating the effects of the anti-life equation, when he freed Iris-West from its control (probably due to his connection with the Speed Force).\nIt is said that Wally West has reached the velocity of 23,759,449,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 (about 24 tredecillion) \u00d7 c (the speed of light), and he could only do this with the help of every human being on earth moving so the Speed Force was joined through everyone. With that speed, he was able to run not only from planet to planet but also to different galaxies and universes at what would be considered a blink of an eye.\nDifferent Flashes.\nIn the final issue of \"52\", a new Multiverse is revealed, originally consisting of 52 identical realities. Among the parallel realities shown is one designated \"Earth-2\". As a result of Mister Mind \"eating\" aspects of this reality, it takes on visual aspects similar to the pre-Crisis Earth-2, including the Flash among other Justice Society of America characters. The names of the characters and the team are not mentioned in the panel in which they appear, but the Flash is visually similar to the Jay Garrick Flash. Based on comments by Grant Morrison, this alternate universe is not the pre-Crisis Earth-2.\nA variant of the Flash\u2014a superfast college student named Mary Maxwell\u2014was seen in the Elseworld book \"Just Imagine Stan Lee Creating The Flash\".\nTanaka Rei.\nThe Flash of Earth-D, Rei was a Japanese man who idolized Barry Allen, whose stories only existed in comic books on this world. Rei was inspired by Allen to become the Flash, much like Allen was inspired to become the Flash by his idol, Jay Garrick. Allen and Rei meet during the \"Crisis on Infinite Earths\" when Barry is coming back from the 30th century and arrives in the wrong universe. As Earth-D was under attack by the shadow demons, Barry called on the Justice League and Tanaka called on the Justice Alliance, his world's version of the Justice League. They built a cosmic treadmill and were able to evacuate much of Earth-D's population. The Justice League left, but 39 seconds later, Earth-D perished.\nRei made his only appearance in \"Legends of the DC Universe: Crisis on Infinite Earths\" (February 1999). The story was written by Marv Wolfman, with art by Paul Ryan (pencils) and Bob McLeod (ink).\nLia Nelson.\nThe young, female Flash of the Tangent Comics Universe is not a speedster, but instead \"the first child born in space\" and a being made up of and able to control light. As a side effect, she can move at the speed of light, which makes her faster than most of the other Post-Crisis Flashes, with only Wally West having survived a light-speed run without becoming trapped in the Speed Force. She recently reappeared in \"Justice League of America\" (vol. 2) #16, somehow summoned out of the paper \"green lantern\" of her universe\u2014an artifact that survived the Crisis that erased the Tangent Universe from existence. Lia Nelson also appeared in \"Countdown: Arena\", battling two versions of the Flash from other Earths within the Multiverse. In the 52-Earth Multiverse, the Tangent Universe is designated Earth-9.\n\"Superman &amp; Batman: Generations 2\".\nIn \", three different Flashes appear: Wally West as Kid Flash in 1964, Wally's cousin Carrie as Kid Flash in 1986, and Jay West, the son of Wally and his wife Magda as the fifth Flash in 2008. Barry Allen makes a cameo appearance out of costume in 1964.\nGreen Lightning.\nAli Rayner-West, aka Green Lightning, is a descendant of both Kyle Rayner and Wally West. She has both a power ring and superspeed, as seen in \". She was a living construct created by Kyle Rayner's subconscious, who later re-fused into his mind.\nAme-Comi.\nA teenage version of Jesse Chambers appears as the Flash of the Ame-Comi universe. As with most of the other characters of that Earth, she sports an Anime-inspired costume.\nThe Crash.\nThe 1980s series \"Captain Carrot and His Amazing Zoo Crew!\" presented the parallel Earth of \"Earth-C-Minus\", a world populated by talking animal superheroes that paralleled the mainstream DC Universe. Earth-C-Minus was the home of the Crash, a turtle with super-speed powers similar to those of Barry Allen's, and a member of his world's superhero team, the Just'a Lotta Animals. The Crash as a youth had read comics about Earth-C's Terrific Whatzit, similar to how Barry Allen enjoyed comics about Earth-Two's Jay Garrick.\nDanica Williams.\nAn African-American teenager of Earth 12 named Danica Williams appears as the Flash in the \"Justice League Beyond\" series, acting as Wally West's successor during the 2040s (following the events of \"Batman Beyond\"). She is employed at the Flash Museum in Central City, and like Barry Allen, is chronically late. She later enters into a relationship with Billy Batson, who is the secret identity of the superhero, Captain Marvel.\nSonic the Hedgehog.\nIn \"DC X Sonic the Hedgehog\", a comic crossover between DC and Sega's \"Sonic the Hedgehog\" franchise, the Justice League transport Sonic and his friends to their world to save them as they battle Darkseid. While trying to figure out a way back home, Sonic and his friends decide to fill in the League's roles as protectors of their world. Sonic dons the mantle of the Flash and battles the hero's rogues gallery in Central City including Reverse-Flash, from whom he retrieves the cyan Chaos Emerald.\nWriters.\nThe following writers have been involved in the ongoing \"The Flash\" and \"Flash Comics\" series:\nAwards.\nThe comics and characters have been nominated for and won several awards over the years, including:\nIn other media.\nThroughout his 70-year history, the Flash has appeared in numerous media. The Flash has been included in multiple animated features, such as \"Super Friends\" and \"Justice League\", as well as his own live action television series and some guest star appearances on \"Smallville\" (as the Bart Allen/Impulse version). There are numerous videos that feature the character.\nRogues.\nLike Batman, Superman, and Green Lantern, the Flash has a reputation for having fought a distinctive and memorable rogues gallery of supervillains. In the Flash's case, some of these villains have adopted the term \"Flash's Rogues Gallery\" as an official title, and insist on being called \"Rogues\" rather than \"supervillains\" or similar names. At times, various combinations of the Rogues have banded together to commit crimes or take revenge on the Flash, usually under the leadership of Captain Cold.\nThe Rogues are known for their communal style relationship, socializing together and operating under a strict moral code, sometimes brutally enforced by Captain Cold. Such \"rules\" include \"no drugs\" and, except in very dire situations or on unique occasions, \"no killing\".\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "31520", "revid": "50532483", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31520", "title": "Hellfire Club", "text": "Exclusive clubs for society rakes\nHellfire Club was a term used to describe several exclusive clubs for high-society rakes established in Great Britain and Ireland in the 18th Century. The name most commonly refers to Francis Dashwood's Order of the Friars of St Francis of Wycombe. Such clubs were rumoured to have served as the meeting places of \"persons of quality\" who wished to take part in socially taboo activities, and the members were often involved in politics. Neither the activities nor membership of the clubs are easy to ascertain. The clubs allegedly had distant ties to an elite society known only as \"The Order of the Second Circle\".\nThe first official Hellfire Club was founded in London in 1718, by Philip Wharton, 1st Duke of Wharton and a handful of other high-society friends. The most notorious club associated with the name was established in England by Francis Dashwood, and met irregularly from around 1749 to around 1760, and possibly up until 1766. The term was closely associated with Brooks's, established in 1764. Other groups described as Hellfire Clubs were set up throughout the 18th century. Most of these arose in Ireland after Wharton's had been dissolved.\nWharton's club was unusual for its time, as it admitted men and women as equals. Most of the other British clubs of the 18th century were practicing sex segregation. The Greyhound Tavern was one of the meeting places used regularly by Wharton's club, but because women were not to be seen in taverns, the meetings were also held at members' houses and at Wharton's riding club. A 1730s incarnation of the Club under Sir Francis Dashwood instead met at the George and Vulture Inn. This version's club motto was \"Fais ce que tu voudras\" (Do what thou wilt), a philosophy of life associated with Fran\u00e7ois Rabelais's fictional abbey at \"Th\u00e9l\u00e8me\" and later used by Aleister Crowley.\nDuke of Wharton's club.\nLord Wharton was made a duke by George I and was a prominent politician with two separate lives: the first as a \"man of letters\" and the second as \"a drunkard, a rioter, an infidel and a rake\". The members of Wharton's club are largely unknown. Mark Blackett-Ord assumes that members included Wharton's immediate friends: the Earl of Hillsborough, cousin; the Earl of Lichfield; and Sir Ed. O'Brien. Aside from these names, other members are not revealed.\nAt the time of the London gentlemen's club, when there was a meeting place for every interest, including poetry, philosophy and politics, Wharton's Hellfire Club was, according to Blackett-Ord, a satirical \"gentleman's club\" which was known to ridicule religion, catching onto the contemporary trend in England of blasphemy. The club was more a joke, meant to shock the outside world, than a serious attack on religion or morality. The supposed president of this club was the Devil, although the members themselves did not apparently worship demons or the Devil, but called themselves devils. Wharton's club admitted men and women as equals, unlike other clubs of the time. The club met on Sundays at a number of different locations around London. The Greyhound Tavern was one of the meeting places used regularly, but because women were not to be seen in taverns, the meetings were also held at members' houses and at Wharton's riding club.\nAccording to at least one source, their activities included mock religious ceremonies and partaking of meals featuring such dishes as \"Holy Ghost Pie\", \"Breast of Venus\", and \"Devil's Loin\", while drinking \"Hell Fire Punch\". Members of the club supposedly came to meetings dressed as characters from the Bible.\nWharton's club came to an end in 1721 when George I, under the influence of Wharton's political enemies (in particular, Robert Walpole) put forward a Bill \"against 'horrid impieties'\" (or immorality), aimed at the Hellfire Club. Wharton's political opposition used his membership as a way to pit him against his political allies, thus removing him from Parliament. After his Club was disbanded, Wharton became a Freemason, and in 1722 he became the Grand Master of England.\nSir Francis Dashwood's clubs.\nSir Francis Dashwood and the Earl of Sandwich are alleged to have been members of a Hellfire Club that met at the George and Vulture Inn throughout the 1730s. Dashwood founded the Order of the Knights of St Francis in 1746, originally meeting at the George &amp; Vulture.\nThe club motto was \"Fais ce que tu voudras\" (Do what thou wilt), a philosophy of life associated with Fran\u00e7ois Rabelais's fictional abbey at \"Th\u00e9l\u00e8me\" and later used by Aleister Crowley.\nFrancis Dashwood was well known for his pranks: for example, while in the imperial court in St Petersburg, he dressed up as the king of Sweden, a great enemy of Russia. The membership of Sir Francis's club was initially limited to twelve but soon increased. Of the original twelve, some are regularly identified: Dashwood, Robert Vansittart, Thomas Potter, Francis Duffield, Edward Thompson, Paul Whitehead and John Montagu, 4th Earl of Sandwich. The list of supposed members is immense; among the more probable candidates are Benjamin Bates II, George Bubb Dodington, a fabulously corpulent man in his 60s; William Hogarth, although hardly a gentleman, has been associated with the club after painting Dashwood as a Franciscan Friar and John Wilkes, though much later, under the pseudonym John of Aylesbury. As there are no records left (these having been burned in 1774), many of these members are just assumed or linked by letters sent to each other.\nMeetings and club activities.\nSir Francis's club was never originally known as a Hellfire Club; it was given this name much later. His club in fact used a number of other names, such as the \"Brotherhood of St. Francis of Wy\", \"Order of Knights of West Wycombe\", \"The Order of the Friars of St Francis of Wycombe\", and later, after moving their meetings to Medmenham Abbey, they became the \"Monks\" or \"Friars of Medmenham\". The first meeting at Sir Francis's family home in West Wycombe was held on \"Walpurgis Night\", 1752; a much larger meeting, it was something of a failure and no large-scale meetings were held there again. In 1751, Dashwood, leased Medmenham Abbey on the Thames from a friend, Francis Duffield.\nOn moving into Medmenham Abbey, Dashwood had numerous expensive works done on the building. It was rebuilt by the architect Nicholas Revett in the style of the 18th-century Gothic revival. At this time, the motto \"Fais ce que tu voudras\" was placed above a doorway in stained glass. It is thought that William Hogarth may have executed murals for this building; none, however, survive. Eventually, the meetings were moved out of the abbey into a series of tunnels and caves in West Wycombe Hill.\nThey were decorated again with mythological themes, phallic symbols and other items of a sexual nature.\nRecords indicate that the members performed \"obscene parodies of religious rites\" according to one source. According to Horace Walpole, the members' \"practice was rigorously pagan: Bacchus and Venus were the deities to whom they almost publicly sacrificed; and the nymphs and the hogsheads that were laid in against the festivals of this new church, sufficiently informed the neighbourhood of the complexion of those hermits.\" Dashwood's garden at West Wycombe contained numerous statues and shrines to different gods; Daphne and Flora, Priapus and the previously mentioned Venus and Dionysus.\nA parish history from 1925 stated that members included \"Frederick, Prince of Wales, the Duke of Queensberry, the Earl of Bute, Lord Melcombe, Sir William Stanhope, K.B, Sir John Dashwood-King, bart., Sir Francis Delaval, K.B., Sir John Vanluttan, kt., Henry Vansittart, afterwards Governor of Bengal, (fn. 13) and Paul Whitehead the poet\". Meetings occurred twice a month, with an AGM lasting a week or more in June or September. The members addressed each other as \"Brothers\" and the leader, which changed regularly, as \"Abbot\". During meetings members supposedly wore ritual clothing: white trousers, jacket and cap, while the \"Abbot\" wore a red ensemble of the same style. Legends of Black Masses and Satan or demon worship have subsequently become attached to the club, beginning in the late Nineteenth Century. Rumours saw female \"guests\" (a euphemism for prostitutes) referred to as \"Nuns\". Dashwood's Club meetings often included mock rituals, items of a pornographic nature, much drinking, wenching and banqueting.\nDecline of Dashwood's Club.\nThe downfall of Dashwood's Club was more drawn-out and complicated. In 1762, the Earl of Bute appointed Dashwood his Chancellor of the Exchequer, despite Dashwood being widely held to be incapable of understanding \"a bar bill of five figures\". (Dashwood resigned the post the next year, having raised a tax on cider which caused near-riots). Dashwood now sat in the House of Lords after taking up the title of Baron Le Despencer after the previous holder died. Then there was the attempted arrest of John Wilkes for seditious libel against the King in the notorious issue No. 45 of his \"The North Briton\" in early 1763. During a search authorised by a General warrant (possibly set up by Sandwich, who wanted to get rid of Wilkes), a version of \"The Essay on Woman\" was discovered set up on the press of a printer whom Wilkes had almost certainly used. The work was almost certainly principally written by Thomas Potter, and from internal evidence can be dated to around 1755. It was scurrilous, blasphemous, libellous, and bawdy, though not pornographic \u2013 still unquestionably illegal under the laws of the time, and the Government subsequently used it to drive Wilkes into exile. Between 1760 and 1765 \"Chrysal, or the Adventures of a Guinea\" by the Irish author Charles Johnstone was published. It contained stories easily identified with Medmenham, one in which Lord Sandwich was ridiculed as having mistaken a monkey for the Devil. This book sparked the association between the Medmenham Monks and the Hellfire Club. By this time, many of the Friars were either dead or too far away for the club to continue as it did before. Medmenham was finished by 1766.\nPaul Whitehead had been the Secretary and Steward of the Order at Medmenham. When he died in 1774, as his will specified, his heart was placed in an urn at West Wycombe. It was sometimes taken out to show to visitors, but was stolen in 1829.\nThe West Wycombe Caves in which the Friars met are now a tourist site known as the \"Hellfire Caves\".\nIn Anstruther, Scotland, a likeminded sex and drinking club called The Beggar's Benison was formed in the 1730s, which survived for a century and spawned additional branches in Glasgow and Edinburgh. Honorary membership was extended to the Prince of Wales in 1783. Thirty-nine years later, while the Prince (by now King George IV) was paying a royal visit to Scotland, he gifted the club a snuff box filled with his mistresses' pubic hair.\nHellfire Clubs in contemporary life.\nPhoenix Society.\nIn 1781, Dashwood's nephew Joseph Alderson (an undergraduate at Brasenose College, Oxford) founded the Phoenix Society (later known as the Phoenix Common Room), but it was only in 1786 that the small gathering of friends asserted themselves as a recognised institution. The Phoenix was established in honour of Sir Francis, who died in 1781, as a symbolic rising from the ashes of Dashwood's earlier institution. To this day, the dining society abides by many of its predecessor's tenets. Its motto 'when one is torn away another succeeds' is from the sixth book of Virgil's \"Aeneid\" and refers to the practice of establishing the continuity of the society through a process of constant renewal of its graduate and undergraduate members, but also refers to the alchemical kabbalistic process that a life snatched via sacrifice is a life given back via a spirit at the command of its master. The Phoenix Common Room's continuous history was reported in 1954 as a matter of note to the college.\nReferences.\nNotes\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography"}

Following the rediscovery of Mendelian inheritance in 1900, Morgan began to study the genetic characteristics of the fruit fly \"Drosophila melanogaster\". In his famous Fly Room at Columbia University's Schermerhorn Hall, Morgan demonstrated that genes are carried on chromosomes and are the mechanical basis of heredity. These discoveries formed the basis of the modern science of genetics.\nDuring his distinguished career, Morgan wrote 22 books and 370 scientific papers. As a result of his work, \"Drosophila\" became a major model organism in contemporary genetics. The Division of Biology which he established at the California Institute of Technology has produced seven Nobel Prize winners.\nEarly life and education.\nMorgan was born in Lexington, Kentucky, to Charlton Hunt Morgan and Ellen Key Howard Morgan. Part of a line of Southern plantation and slave owners on his father's side, Morgan was a nephew of Confederate General John Hunt Morgan; his great-grandfather John Wesley Hunt had been one of the first millionaires west of the Allegheny Mountains. Through his mother, he was the great-grandson of Francis Scott Key, the author of the \"Star Spangled Banner\", and John Eager Howard, governor and senator from Maryland. Following the Civil War, the family fell on hard times with the temporary loss of civil and some property rights for those who aided the Confederacy. His father had difficulty finding work in politics and spent much of his time coordinating veterans' reunions.\nBeginning at age 16 in the Preparatory Department, Morgan attended the State College of Kentucky (now the University of Kentucky). He focused on science; he particularly enjoyed natural history, and worked with the U.S. Geological Survey in his summers. He graduated as valedictorian in 1886 with a Bachelor of Science degree. Following a summer at the Marine Biology School in Annisquam, Massachusetts, Morgan began graduate studies in zoology at the recently founded Johns Hopkins University. After two years of experimental work with morphologist William Keith Brooks and writing several publications, Morgan was eligible to receive a Master of Science from the State College of Kentucky in 1888. The college required two years of study at another institution and an examination by the college faculty. The college offered Morgan a full professorship; however, he chose to stay at Johns Hopkins and was awarded a relatively large fellowship to help him fund his studies.\nUnder Brooks, Morgan completed his thesis work on the embryology of sea spiders\u2014collected during the summers of 1889 and 1890 at the Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole, Massachusetts\u2014to determine their phylogenetic relationship with other arthropods. He concluded that concerning embryology, they were more closely related to spiders than crustaceans. Based on the publication of this work, Morgan was awarded his Ph.D. from Johns Hopkins in 1890 and was also awarded the Bruce Fellowship in Research. He used the fellowship to travel to Jamaica, the Bahamas and Europe to conduct further research.\nEvery summer from 1910 to 1925, Morgan and his colleagues at the famous Fly Room at Columbia University moved their research program to the Marine Biological Laboratory. Aside from being an independent investigator at the MBL from 1890 to 1942, he became very involved in the governance of the institution, including serving as an MBL trustee from 1897 to 1945.\nCareer and research.\nBryn Mawr.\nIn 1890, Morgan was appointed associate professor (and head of the biology department) at Johns Hopkins' sister school Bryn Mawr College, replacing his colleague Edmund Beecher Wilson. Morgan taught all morphology-related courses, while the other member of the department, Jacques Loeb, taught the physiological courses. Although Loeb stayed for only one year, it was the beginning of their lifelong friendship. Morgan lectured in biology five days a week, giving two lectures a day. He frequently included his recent research in his lectures. Although an enthusiastic teacher, he was most interested in research in the laboratory. During the first few years at Bryn Mawr, he produced descriptive studies of sea acorns, ascidian worms, and frogs. Morgan co-authored an 1894 paper on the division of the egg of \"Rana temporaria\" with Japanese Bryn Mawr student Ume Tsuda; this is considered to be the first scientific paper written in English by a Japanese woman.\nIn 1894 Morgan was granted a year's absence to conduct research in the laboratories of \"Stazione Zoologica\" in Naples, where Wilson had worked two years earlier. There he worked with German biologist Hans Driesch, whose research in the experimental study of development piqued Morgan's interest. Among other projects that year, Morgan completed an experimental study of ctenophore embryology. In Naples and through Loeb, he became familiar with the \"Entwicklungsmechanik\" (roughly, \"developmental mechanics\") school of experimental biology. It was a reaction to the vitalistic \"Naturphilosophie\", which was extremely influential in 19th-century morphology. Morgan changed his work from traditional, largely descriptive morphology to experimental embryology that sought physical and chemical explanations for organismal development.\nAt the time, there was considerable scientific debate over the question of how an embryo developed. Following Wilhelm Roux's mosaic theory of development, some believed that hereditary material was divided among embryonic cells, which were predestined to form particular parts of a mature organism. Driesch and others thought that development was due to epigenetic factors, where interactions between the protoplasm and the nucleus of the egg and the environment could affect development. Morgan was in the latter camp; his work with Driesch demonstrated that blastomeres isolated from sea urchin and ctenophore eggs could develop into complete larvae, contrary to the predictions (and experimental evidence) of Roux's supporters. A related debate involved the role of epigenetic and environmental factors in development; on this front Morgan showed that sea urchin eggs could be induced to divide without fertilization by adding magnesium chloride. Loeb continued this work and became well known for creating fatherless frogs using the method.\nWhen Morgan returned to Bryn Mawr in 1895, he was promoted to full professor. Morgan's main lines of experimental work involved regeneration and larval development; in each case, his goal was to distinguish internal and external causes to shed light on the Roux-Driesch debate. He wrote his first book, \"The Development of the Frog's Egg\" (1897). He began a series of studies on different organisms' ability to regenerate. He looked at grafting and regeneration in tadpoles, fish, and earthworms; in 1901 he published his research as \"Regeneration\".\nBeginning in 1900, Morgan started working on the problem of sex determination, which he had previously dismissed when Nettie Stevens discovered the impact of the Y chromosome on sex. He also continued to study the evolutionary problems that had been the focus of his earliest work.\nColumbia University.\nMorgan worked at Columbia University for 24 years, from 1904 until 1928 when he left for a position at the California Institute of Technology.\nIn 1904, his friend, Jofi Joseph died of tuberculosis, and he felt he ought to mourn her, though E. B. Wilson\u2014still blazing the path for his younger friend\u2014invited Morgan to join him at Columbia University. This move freed him to focus fully on experimental work.\nWhen Morgan took the professorship in experimental zoology, he became increasingly focused on the mechanisms of heredity and evolution. He published \"Evolution and Adaptation\" (1903); like many biologists at the time, he saw evidence for biological evolution (as in the common descent of similar species) but rejected Darwin's proposed mechanism of natural selection acting on small, constantly produced variations.\nExtensive work in biometry seemed to indicate that continuous natural variation had distinct limits and did not represent heritable changes. Embryological development posed an additional problem in Morgan's view, as selection could not act on the early, incomplete stages of highly complex organs such as the eye. The common solution of the Lamarckian mechanism of inheritance of acquired characters, which featured prominently in Darwin's theory, was increasingly rejected by biologists. According to Morgan's biographer Garland Allen, he was also hindered by his views on taxonomy: he thought that species were entirely artificial creations that distorted the continuously variable range of real forms, while he held a \"typological\" view of larger taxa and could see no way that one such group could transform into another. But while Morgan was skeptical of natural selection for many years, his theories of heredity and variation were radically transformed through his conversion to Mendelism.\nIn 1900 three scientists, Carl Correns, Erich von Tschermak and Hugo De Vries, had rediscovered the work of Gregor Mendel, and with it the foundation of genetics. De Vries proposed that new species were created by mutation, bypassing the need for either Lamarckism or Darwinism. As Morgan had dismissed both evolutionary theories, he was seeking to prove De Vries' mutation theory with his experimental heredity work. He was initially skeptical of Mendel's laws of heredity (as well as the related chromosomal theory of sex determination), which were being considered as a possible basis for natural selection.\nFollowing C. W. Woodworth and William E. Castle, around 1908 Morgan started working on the fruit fly \"Drosophila melanogaster\", and encouraging students to do so as well. With Fernandus Payne, he mutated \"Drosophila\" through physical, chemical, and radiational means. He began cross-breeding experiments to find heritable mutations, but they had no significant success for two years. Castle had also had difficulty identifying mutations in \"Drosophila\", which were tiny. Finally, in 1909, a series of heritable mutants appeared, some of which displayed Mendelian inheritance patterns; in 1910 Morgan noticed a white-eyed mutant male among the red-eyed wild types. When white-eyed flies were bred with a red-eyed female, their progeny were all red-eyed. A second-generation cross produced white-eyed males\u2014a sex-linked recessive trait, the gene for which Morgan named \"white\". Morgan also discovered a pink-eyed mutant that showed a different pattern of inheritance. In a paper published in \"Science\" in 1911, he concluded that (1) some traits were sex-linked, (2) the trait was probably carried on one of the sex chromosomes, and (3) other genes were probably carried on specific chromosomes as well.\nMorgan and his students counted the mutant characteristics of thousands of fruit flies and studied their inheritance. A miniature-wing mutant on the sex chromosome sometimes sorted independently of the white-eye mutation. This led Morgan to the idea of genetic linkage and to hypothesize the phenomenon of crossing over. He relied on the discovery of Frans Alfons Janssens, a Belgian professor at the University of Leuven, who described the phenomenon in 1909 and had called it \"chiasmatypy\". Morgan proposed that the amount of crossing over between linked genes differs and that crossover frequency might indicate the distance separating genes on the chromosome. The later English geneticist J. B. S. Haldane suggested that the unit of measurement for linkage be called the morgan. Morgan's student Alfred Sturtevant developed the first genetic map in 1913.\nIn 1915 Morgan, Sturtevant, Calvin Bridges and H. J. Muller wrote the seminal book \"The Mechanism of Mendelian Heredity\". Geneticist Curt Stern called the book \"the fundamental textbook of the new genetics\".\nIn the following years, most biologists came to accept the Mendelian-chromosome theory, which was independently proposed by Walter Sutton and Theodor Boveri in 1902/1903, and elaborated and expanded by Morgan and his students. Garland Allen characterized the post-1915 period as one of normal science, in which \"The activities of 'geneticists' were aimed at further elucidation of the details and implications of the Mendelian-chromosome theory developed between 1910 and 1915.\" But, the details of the increasingly complex theory, as well as the concept of the gene and its physical nature, were still controversial. Critics such as W. E. Castle pointed to contrary results in other organisms, suggesting that genes interact with each other, while Richard Goldschmidt and others thought there was no compelling reason to view genes as discrete units residing on chromosomes.\nBecause of Morgan's dramatic success with \"Drosophila\", many other labs throughout the world took up fruit fly genetics. Columbia became the center of an informal exchange network, through which promising mutant \"Drosophila\" strains were transferred from lab to lab; \"Drosophila\" became one of the first and for some time the most widely used, model organisms. Morgan's group remained highly productive, but Morgan largely withdrew from doing fly work and gave his lab members considerable freedom in designing and carrying out their own experiments.\nHe returned to embryology and worked to encourage the spread of genetics research to other organisms and the spread of mechanistic experimental approach (\"Enwicklungsmechanik\") to all biological fields. After 1915, he also became a strong critic of the growing eugenics movement, which adopted genetic approaches in support of racist views of \"improving\" humanity.\nMorgan's fly-room at Columbia became world-famous, and he found it easy to attract funding and visiting academics. In 1927 after 25 years at Columbia, and nearing the age of retirement, he received an offer from George Ellery Hale to establish a school of biology in California.\nCaltech.\nIn 1928 Morgan joined the faculty of the California Institute of Technology where he remained until his retirement 14 years later in 1942.\nMorgan moved to California to head the Division of Biology at the California Institute of Technology in 1928. In establishing the biology division, Morgan wanted to distinguish his program from those offered by Johns Hopkins and Columbia, with research focused on genetics and evolution; experimental embryology; physiology; biophysics, and biochemistry. He was also instrumental in the establishment of the Marine Laboratory at Corona del Mar. He wanted to attract the best people to the Division at Caltech, so he took Bridges, Sturtevant, Jack Shultz and Albert Tyler from Columbia and took on Theodosius Dobzhansky as an international research fellow. More scientists came to work in the Division including George Beadle, Boris Ephrussi, Edward L. Tatum, Linus Pauling, Frits Went, Edward B. Lewis, and Sidney W. Byance with his reputation, Morgan held numerous prestigious positions in American science organizations. From 1927 to 1931 Morgan served as the President of the National Academy of Sciences; in 1930 he was the President of the American Association for the Advancement of Science; and in 1932 he chaired the Sixth International Congress of Genetics in Ithaca, New York. In 1933 Morgan was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine; he had been nominated in 1919 and 1930 for the same work. As an acknowledgment of the group nature of his discovery, he gave his prize money to Bridges, Sturtevant, and his own children. Morgan declined to attend the awards ceremony in 1933, instead attending in 1934. The 1933 rediscovery of the giant polytene chromosomes in the salivary gland of \"Drosophila\" may have influenced his choice. Until that point, the lab's results had been inferred from phenotypic results, the visible polytene chromosome enabled them to confirm their results on a physical basis. Morgan's Nobel acceptance speech entitled \"The Contribution of Genetics to Physiology and Medicine\" downplayed the contribution genetics could make to medicine beyond genetic counseling. In 1939 he was awarded the Copley Medal by the Royal Society.\nHe received two extensions of his contract at Caltech, but eventually retired in 1942, becoming a professor and chairman emeritus. George Beadle returned to Caltech to replace Morgan as chairman of the department in 1946. Although he had retired, Morgan kept offices across the road from the Division and continued laboratory work. In his retirement, he returned to the questions of sexual differentiation, regeneration, and embryology.\nDeath.\nMorgan had throughout his life suffered from a chronic duodenal ulcer. In 1945, at age 79, he experienced a severe heart attack and died from a ruptured artery.\nOn August 30, 2025, the family of Thomas Hunt Morgan and his wife Lilian Vaughan Morgan transferred their cremains from the Mountain View Mausoleum in Altadena, California to the Woods Hole Community Cemetery in Woods Hole, Massachusetts. The community cemetery is managed by the Church of the Messiah in Woods Hole.\nMorgan and evolution.\nMorgan was interested in evolution throughout his life. He wrote his thesis on the phylogeny of sea spiders (pycnogonids) and wrote four books about evolution. In \"Evolution and Adaptation\" (1903), he argued the anti-Darwinist position that selection could never produce wholly new species by acting on slight individual differences. He rejected Darwin's theory of sexual selection and the Neo-Lamarckian theory of the inheritance of acquired characters. Morgan was not the only scientist attacking natural selection. The period 1875\u20131925 has been called 'The eclipse of Darwinism'. After discovering many small stable heritable mutations in \"Drosophila\", Morgan gradually changed his mind. The relevance of mutations for evolution is that only characters that are inherited can have an effect on evolution. Since Morgan solved the problem of heredity (1915), he was in a unique position to examine critically Darwin's theory of natural selection.\nIn \"\" (1916), Morgan discussed questions such as: \"Does selection play any role in evolution? How can selection produce anything new? Is selection no more than the elimination of the unfit? Is selection a creative force?\" After eliminating some misunderstandings and explaining in detail the new science of Mendelian heredity and its chromosomal basis, Morgan concludes, \"the evidence shows clearly that the characters of wild animals and plants, as well as those of domesticated races, are inherited both in the wild and in domesticated forms according to the Mendel's Law\". \"Evolution has taken place by the incorporation into the race of those mutations that are beneficial to the life and reproduction of the organism\". Injurious mutations have practically no chance of becoming established. Far from rejecting evolution, as the title of his 1916 book may suggest, Morgan, laid the foundation of the science of genetics. He also laid the theoretical foundation for the mechanism of evolution: natural selection. Heredity was a central plank of Darwin's theory of natural selection, but Darwin could not provide a working theory of heredity. Darwinism could not progress without a correct theory of genetics. By creating that foundation, Morgan contributed to the neo-Darwinian synthesis, despite his criticism of Darwin at the beginning of his career. Much work on the Evolutionary Synthesis remained to be done.\nAwards and honors.\nMorgan left an important legacy in genetics. Some of Morgan's students from Columbia and Caltech went on to win their own Nobel Prizes, including George Wells Beadle and Hermann Joseph Muller. Nobel prize winner Eric Kandel has written of Morgan, \"Much as Darwin's insights into the evolution of animal species first gave coherence to nineteenth-century biology as a descriptive science, Morgan's findings about genes and their location on chromosomes helped transform biology into an experimental science.\"\nPersonal life.\nOn June 4, 1904, Morgan married Lillian Vaughan Sampson (1870\u20131952), who had entered graduate school in biology at Bryn Mawr the same year Morgan joined the faculty; she put aside her scientific work for 16 years of their marriage when they had four children. Later she contributed significantly to Morgan's \"Drosophila\" work. One of their four children (one boy and three girls) was Isabel Morgan (1911\u20131996) (Marr. Mountain), who became a virologist at Johns Hopkins, specializing in polio research. Morgan was an atheist.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It initially focused on David Keel (Ian Hendry), aided by John Steed (Patrick Macnee). Ian Hendry left after the first series; Steed then became the main character, partnered with a succession of assistants. His most famous assistants were intelligent, stylish, and assertive women: Cathy Gale (Honor Blackman), Emma Peel (Diana Rigg), and Tara King (Linda Thorson). Dresses and suits for the series were made by Pierre Cardin.\nThe series screened as one-hour episodes for its entire run. The first episode, \"Hot Snow\", aired on 7 January 1961. The final episode, \"Bizarre\", aired on 21 April 1969 in the United States, and on 17 May 1969 in the United Kingdom.\n\"The Avengers\" was produced by ABC Weekend TV, a contractor within the ITV network. After a merger with Rediffusion London in July 1968, ABC Weekend became Thames Television, which continued production of the series, subcontracted to ABC Television Films. By 1969, \"The Avengers\" was shown in more than 90 countries. ITV produced a sequel series, \"The New Avengers\" (1976\u20131977), with Patrick Macnee returning as John Steed, and two new partners. In 2004 and 2007, \"The Avengers\" was ranked No. 17 and No. 20 on \"TV Guide\"'s Top Cult Shows Ever.\nPremise.\n\"The Avengers\" was marked by different eras as co-stars came and went. The only constant was John Steed, played by Patrick Macnee.\nSeries 1 (1961).\nABC Weekend TV produced a single series of \"Police Surgeon\", in which Ian Hendry played police surgeon Geoffrey Brent, from September through December 1960. While \"Police Surgeon\" did not last long, viewers praised Ian Hendry, and ABC Television cast him in its new series \"The Avengers\", which replaced \"Police Surgeon\" in January 1961.\n\"The Avengers\" began with the episode \"Hot Snow\", in which medical doctor David H. Keel (Hendry) investigates the murder of his fianc\u00e9e, office receptionist Peggy, by a drug ring. A stranger named John Steed, who was also investigating the ring, appears. Together, Dr. Keel and Steed set out to avenge Peggy's death in the first two episodes. Steed asks Dr. Keel to partner with him, as needed, to solve crimes. Ian Hendry was considered the star of the new series, receiving top billing over Patrick Macnee, and Steed did not appear in two of the series' episodes.\nAs the first series of \"The Avengers\" progressed, Steed's importance increased, and he carried the final episode solo. While Steed and Dr. Keel used wit while discussing crimes and dangers, the series also depicted the interplay\u2014and often tension\u2014between Dr. Keel's idealism and Steed's professionalism. As seen in one of the three surviving episodes from the first series, \"The Frighteners\", Steed also had informants among the general population to aid his investigations, similar to the \"Baker Street Irregulars\" of Sherlock Holmes.\nThe other regular in the first series was Carol Wilson (Ingrid Hafner), the nurse and receptionist who replaced the slain Peggy. Carol assisted Dr. Keel and Steed in cases, and in at least one episode (\"Girl on the Trapeze\") was very much in the thick of the action, but without being part of Steed's inner circle. Ingrid Hafner had played opposite Ian Hendry as a nurse in one episode of \"Police Surgeon\". The role of Carol Wilson was initially offered to Jan Watson, who turned it down for another film.\nThe series was shot on 405-line videotape using a multicamera setup. There was little provision for editing and virtually no location footage was shot (although the first shot of the first episode consisted of location footage). As was standard practice at the time, videotapes of early episodes of \"The Avengers\" were reused. At present, only three complete Series 1 episodes are known to exist and are held in archives as 16-mm film telerecordings: \"Girl on the Trapeze\" (which does not feature Steed), \"The Frighteners\" and \"Tunnel of Fear\". Additionally, the first 15 minutes of the first episode, \"Hot Snow\", also exist as a telerecording; the extant footage ends at the conclusion of the first act, prior to the introduction of John Steed.\nThe missing television episodes were recreated for audio by Big Finish Productions under the title of \"The Avengers\u00a0\u2013 The Lost Episodes\" and star Julian Wadham as Steed, Anthony Howell as Dr Keel and Lucy Briggs-Owen as Carol Wilson.\nSeries 2\u20133 (1962\u20131964).\nProduction of the first series was cut short by a strike. By the time production could begin on the second series, Ian Hendry had quit to pursue a film career. Patrick Macnee was promoted to star, and Steed became the focus of the series, initially working with a rotation of three different partners. Dr Martin King (Jon Rollason), a thinly disguised recreation of the Dr. Keel character, saw action in only three episodes, which were produced from scripts written for the first series. Dr. King was intended to be a transitional character between Dr. Keel and Steed's two new female partners, but while the Dr. King episodes were shot first, they were shown out of production order in the middle of the season. The character was thereafter quickly and quietly dropped.\nNightclub singer Venus Smith (Julie Stevens) appeared in six episodes. She was a complete \"amateur\", meaning that she did not have any professional crime-fighting skills as did the two doctors. She was excited to be participating in a spy adventure alongside secret agent Steed (although some episodes\u2014\"The Removal Men\", \"The Decapod\"\u2014indicate she is not always enthusiastic). Nonetheless, she appears to be attracted to him, and their relationship is somewhat similar to that later portrayed between Steed and Tara King. Her episodes featured live musical portions showcasing her singing performances. The character of Venus underwent some revision during her run, adopting more youthful demeanour and dress.\nThe first episode broadcast in the second series introduced the partner who would change the show into the format for which it is most remembered. Honor Blackman played Mrs. Cathy Gale, a self-assured, quick-witted anthropologist who was skilled in judo and had a passion for leather clothes. Widowed during the Mau Mau rebellion years in Kenya, she was the \"talented amateur\" who provided her aid to Steed's cases as a service to her nation. She was said to have been born on 5 October 1930 at midnight, and was reared in Africa. Mrs. Catherine Gale was in her early-to-mid 30s during her tenure, in contrast to female characters in similar series, who tended to be younger.\nCatherine Gale was unlike any female character seen before on British TV, and she became a household name. Reportedly, part of her charm was because her earliest appearances were episodes in which dialogue written for Keel was simply transferred to her. Series scriptwriter Dennis Spooner described this detail: \"There's the famous story of how Honor Blackman played Ian Hendry's part, which is why they stuck her in leather and such\u2014it was so much cheaper than changing the lines!\" In \"Conspiracy of Silence\", she holds her own in a vociferous tactical disagreement with her partner.\nVenus Smith did not return for the third series, and Cathy Gale became Steed's only regular partner. The series established a level of sexual tension between Steed and Cathy Gale, but the writers were not allowed to go beyond flirting and innuendo. Despite this, the relationship between Steed and Catherine Gale was progressive for 1962\u201363. In \"The Golden Eggs,\" it is revealed that Cathy Gale lived in Steed's flat; according to Steed, her rent was to keep the refrigerator well-stocked and to cook for him (she appears to do neither). However, this was said to be a temporary arrangement while Catherine Gale looked for a new home, and Steed was sleeping at a hotel.\nDuring the first series, there were hints that Steed worked for a branch of British Intelligence, and this was expanded in the second series. Steed initially received orders from different superiors, including someone referred to as \"Charles\", and \"One-Ten\" (Douglas Muir). By the third series, the delivery of Steed's orders was not depicted on screen or explained. The secret organisation to which Steed belongs is shown in \"The Nutshell\", and it is Cathy Gale's first visit to their headquarters.\nSmall references to Steed's background were occasionally made. In the Series 3 episode \"Death of a Batman,\" it was said that Steed was with I Corps in the Second World War, and in Munich in 1945. In the Series 4 episode \"The Hour That Never Was,\" Steed attends a reunion of his RAF squadron. Since the ties he wears are either cavalry or old school, it is apparent that he has attended a number of leading public schools.\nA theatrical film version of the series was in its initial planning stages by late 1963, after Series 3 was completed. An early story proposal paired Steed and Catherine Gale with a male and female duo of American agents, to make the movie appeal to the American market. Before the project could gain momentum, Honor Blackman was cast opposite Sean Connery in \"Goldfinger\", requiring her to leave the series.\nSeries transformation.\nDuring the Gale era, Steed was transformed from a rugged trenchcoat-wearing agent into the stereotypical English gentleman, complete with Savile Row suit, bowler hat and umbrella, with clothes later designed by Pierre Cardin. (Steed had first donned bowler and carried his distinctive umbrella during the first series, as \"The Frighteners\" depicts.) The bowler and umbrella were soon revealed to be full of tricks, including a sword hidden within the umbrella handle and a steel plate concealed in the hat. These items were referred to in the French, German and Polish titles of the series, \"Chapeau melon et bottes de cuir\" (\"Bowler hat and leather boots\"), \"Mit Schirm, Charme und Melone\" (\"With Umbrella, Charm and Bowler Hat\") and \"Rewolwer i melonik\" (\"A Revolver and a Bowler Hat\"), respectively. With his impeccable manners, old-world sophistication and vintage car, Steed came to represent the traditional Englishman of an earlier era.\nBy contrast, Steed's partners were youthful, forward-looking and always attired in the latest mod fashions. Catherine Gale's innovative leather outfits suited her many athletic fight scenes. Honor Blackman became a star in Britain with her black leather outfits and boots (nicknamed \"kinky boots\") and her judo-based fighting style. Patrick Macnee and Honor Blackman even released a novelty song called \"Kinky Boots\". Honor Blackman also carried a pistol in \"Killer Whale\". Some of the clothes seen in \"The Avengers\" were designed at the studio of John Sutcliffe, who published the \"AtomAge\" fetish magazine.\nSeries scriptwriter Dennis Spooner said that the series would frequently feature Steed visiting busy public places, such as the main airport in London, without anyone else present in the scene: \"'Can't you afford extras?' they'd ask. Well, it wasn't like that. It's just that Steed had to be alone to be accepted. Put him in a crowd and he sticks out like a sore thumb! Let's face it, with normal people he's \"weird\". The trick to making him acceptable is never to show him in a normal world, just fighting villains who are odder than he is!\"\nSeries 4\u20135 (1965\u20131967).\nThe show was sold to the American Broadcasting Company (ABC) in 1965, and \"The Avengers\" became one of the first British series to be aired on prime-time US television. The US ABC network paid the then-unheard-of sum of $2 million for the first 26 episodes. The average budget for each episode was reportedly \u00a356,000, which was high for the British industry. The fourth series aired in the US from March to the beginning of September 1966. Each episode still finished with the logo of ABC Weekend TV.\nThe US deal meant that the producers could afford to start shooting the series on 35mm film, with production transferring from ABC's television studios in Teddington to the Associated British film studios in Elstree. The use of film, rather than the videotape of the earlier episodes, was essential, because British 405-line video was technically incompatible with the US NTSC videotape format. Filmed productions were standard on US prime-time television at the time. \"The Avengers\" continued to be produced in black-and-white.\nThe transfer to film meant that episodes would be shot using the single-camera setup, giving the production greater flexibility. The use of film production and the single-camera production style allowed more sophisticated visuals and camera angles, and more outdoor location shots, all of which greatly improved the look of the series. As was standard on British television filmed production through the 1960s, all location work on Series 4 was shot mute, with the soundtrack created in post-production. Dialogue scenes were filmed in the studio, leading to some jumps between location and studio footage.\nNew female partner Mrs. Emma Peel (Diana Rigg) debuted in October 1965. The name of the character derived from a comment by writers, during development, that they wanted a character with \"man appeal\". In an early attempt to incorporate this concept into the character's name, she was called \"Samantha Peel\", shortened to the awkward \"Mantha Peel\". Eventually, the writers began referring to the idea by the verbal shorthand \"M. Appeal\", which gave rise to the character's ultimate name.\nAfter more than 60 actresses had been auditioned, the first choice to play the role was Elizabeth Shepherd. However, after filming one and a half episodes (the pilot, \"The Town of No Return\", and part of \"The Murder Market\"), Elizabeth Shepherd was released. Her on-screen personality was deemed less interesting than that of Honor Blackman's Catherine Gale, and it was decided that she was not right for the role. Another 20 actresses were auditioned before the show's casting director, Dodo Watts, suggested that producers Brian Clemens and Albert Fennell check out a televised drama featuring the relatively unknown Diana Rigg. (She had earlier guested in an episode of \"The Sentimental Agent\" that Brian Clemens had written.) Diana Rigg's screen test with Patrick Macnee showed that the two immediately worked well together.\nA prologue was added to the beginning of all the fourth-series episodes for the American broadcasts. This was to clarify some initial confusion audiences had regarding the characters and their mission. In the opener, a waiter holding a champagne bottle falls dead onto a human-sized chessboard, a dagger protruding from a target on his back. Steed and Mrs. Emma Peel (dressed in her trademark leather catsuit) walk up to the body as the voice-over explains: \"Extraordinary crimes against the people, and the state, have to be avenged by agents extraordinary. Two such people are John Steed, top professional, and his partner Emma Peel, talented amateur. Otherwise known as The Avengers\". During this voice-over, Steed pours two drinks from the wine bottle and Mrs. Peel replaces her gun in her boot. They clink glasses and depart together as the screen fades to black and the opening titles begin.\nIn contrast to the Gale episodes, there is a lighter, comic touch in Steed's and Mrs. Emma Peel's interactions with each other and their reactions to other characters and situations. Earlier series had a harder tone, with the Gale era including some quite serious espionage dramas. This almost completely disappeared as Steed and Mrs. Emma Peel visibly enjoy topping each other's witticisms. The layer of conflict with Catherine Gale\u2014who on occasion openly resented being used by Steed, often without her permission\u2014is absent from Steed's interaction with Emma Peel. Also, the sexual tension between Steed and Catherine Gale is quite different from the tension between Steed and Emma Peel. In both cases, the exact relationship between the partners is left ambiguous, although they seemed to have \"carte blanche\" to visit each other's homes whenever they please, and it is not uncommon for scenes to suggest that Steed had spent the night at Catherine Gale's or Emma Peel's home, or vice versa. Although nothing \"improper\" is displayed, the close chemistry between Steed and Mrs. Emma Peel constantly suggests intimacy between the two.\nScience fiction and fantasy elements (a style later known as Spy-Fi) also began to emerge in storylines. The duo encounters killer robots (\"The Cybernauts\"), telepaths (\"Too Many Christmas Trees\") and giant alien carnivorous plants (\"The Man-Eater of Surrey Green\").\nIn her fourth episode, \"Death at Bargain Prices,\" Mrs. Emma Peel takes an undercover job at a department store. Her uniform for promoting space-age toys is an elaborate leather catsuit plus silver boots, sash and welder's gloves. The suit (minus the silver accessories) became her signature outfit, which she wore primarily for fight scenes in early episodes and in the titles. Some episodes contain a fetishistic undercurrent. In \"A Touch of Brimstone\", Mrs. Peel dresses in a dominatrix outfit of corset, laced boots and spiked collar to become the \"Queen of Sin\".\nEmma Peel's avant-garde fashions, featuring bold accents and high-contrast geometric patterns, emphasise her youthful, contemporary personality. For the 1965 season, some of her most memorable outfits were designed by John Bates, including graphic black-and-white Op art mini-coats and accessories, and a silver ensemble comprising a bra bodice, low-slung trousers and jacket. She represents the modern England of the Sixties\u00a0\u2013 just as Steed, with his vintage style and mannerisms, personifies Edwardian-era nostalgia. According to Patrick Macnee in his book \"The Avengers and Me,\" Diana Rigg disliked wearing leather and insisted on a new line of fabric athletic wear for the fifth series. Alun Hughes, who had designed clothing for Diana Rigg's personal wardrobe, was suggested by the actress to design Emma Peel's \"softer\" new wardrobe. Pierre Cardin was brought in to design a new wardrobe for Macnee. In the US, \"TV Guide\" ran a four-page photo spread on Diana Rigg's new \"Emmapeeler\" outfits (10\u201316 June 1967). Eight tight-fitting jumpsuits were created, in a variety of bright colours and made of the stretch fabric crimplene.\nMove to colour.\nAfter one filmed series (of 26 episodes) in black and white, \"The Avengers\" began filming in colour for the fifth series in 1966. It was three years before Britain's ITV network began full colour broadcasting. The first 16 episodes of this series were broadcast concurrently in the US, in colour, and the UK, in black and white, from January to May 1967. Eight further episodes were broadcast in the UK beginning in late September, while these episodes were withheld in the US until early 1968, where they would be immediately succeeded by the first batch of episodes featuring Diana Rigg's replacement, Linda Thorson. The American prologue of the fourth series was modified for the colour episodes. The show opened with the caption \"The Avengers in Color\" (required by the US ABC for colour series at that time), followed by Steed unwrapping the foil from a champagne bottle and Emma Peel shooting the cork away. Unlike the \"chessboard\" opening of the previous series, this new prologue had no narrative voice-over, and the scene was also included in UK broadcasts of the series. At the end of the closing credits, all previous series had ended with the ABC Weekend TV logo, but the fifth and sixth series \u2014 now made by ABC's sister company A.B.C. Television Films \u2014 instead featured an animation where the letters \"ABC\" were revealed to stand for \"Associated British Corporation\", a name apparently invented for ABC shows exported to the US to avoid confusion with the US ABC network. (The legal name of ABC Weekend TV was originally \"Associated British Cinemas (Television) Ltd\", later shortened to \"A.B.C. Television Ltd\".)\nThe first 16 episodes of the fifth series begin with Emma Peel receiving a call-to-duty message from Steed: \"Mrs. Peel, we're needed\". Emma Peel would be conducting her normal activities when she unexpectedly received a message on a calling card or within a delivered gift, at which point Steed suddenly appeared (usually in her apartment). The series also introduced a comic tagline caption to the episode title, using the format of \"Steed [does this], Emma [does that]\". For example, \"The Joker\" had the opening caption: \"Steed trumps an ace, Emma plays a lone hand\". \"The Joker\" was to a large extent a rewrite of \"Don't Look Behind You\", a black-and-white Cathy Gale episode. Three other colour Emma Peel episodes were rewrites of Cathy Gale episodes.\nThe \"Mrs Peel, we're needed\" scenes and the alternate taglines were dropped after the first 16 episodes, after a break in production, for financial reasons. They were deemed by the UK networks as disposable if \"The Avengers\" was to return to ITV screens (Dave Rogers' book \"The Avengers Anew\" lists a set for every Steed/Emma Peel episode except \"The Forget-Me-Knot\").\nStories were increasingly characterised by a futuristic, science-fiction bent, with mad scientists and their creations wreaking havoc. The duo dealt with being shrunk to doll size (\"Mission... Highly Improbable\"), pet cats being electrically altered to become ferocious and lethal \"miniature tigers\" (\"The Hidden Tiger\"), killer automata (\"Return of The Cybernauts\"), mind-transferring machines (\"Who's Who???\") and invisible foes (\"The See-Through Man\").\nThe series parodied its American contemporaries with episodes such as \"The Girl From AUNTIE\", \"Mission... Highly Improbable\" and \"The Winged Avenger\" (spoofing \"The Man from U.N.C.L.E.\", \"\" and \"Batman\", respectively). The show still carried the basic format: Steed and his associate were charged with solving the problem in the space of a 50-minute episode, thus preserving the safety of 1960s Britain.\nHumour was evident in the names and acronyms of the organisations. For example, in \"The Living Dead,\" two rival groups examine reported ghost sightings: FOG (Friends of Ghosts) and SMOG (Scientific Measurement of Ghosts). \"The Hidden Tiger\" features the Philanthropic Union for Rescue, Relief and Recuperation of Cats\u2014PURRR\u2014led by characters named Cheshire, Manx and Angora.\nThe series also occasionally adopted a metafictional tone, coming close to breaking the fourth wall. In the Series 5 episode \"Something Nasty in the Nursery\", Emma Peel directly refers to the series' storytelling convention of having potentially helpful sources of information killed off just before she or Steed arrive. This then occurs a few minutes later. In the tag scene for the same episode, Steed and Emma Peel tell viewers\u2014indirectly\u2014to tune in next week.\nDiana Rigg's stunt double was stuntwoman Cyd Child, though stuntman Peter Elliot doubled for Diana Rigg in a stunt dive in \"The Bird Who Knew Too Much\".\nDiana Rigg's departure.\nDiana Rigg was initially unhappy with the way she was treated by the show's producers. During her first series, she learned that she was being paid less than the cameraman. She demanded a raise to put her more on a par with her co-star, or she would leave the show. The producers gave in, thanks to the show's great popularity in the US. At the end of the fifth series in 1967, Diana Rigg left to pursue other projects. This included following Honor Blackman to play a leading role in a James Bond film, \"On Her Majesty's Secret Service\", as James Bond's wife Tracy Bond.\nOn 25 October 2015, to mark 50 years of Emma Peel, the BFI (British Film Institute) screened an episode of \"The Avengers\" followed by an onstage interview with Diana Rigg, during which she discussed her reasons for leaving the show and Patrick Macnee's reaction to her departure. Patrick Macnee and Diana Rigg remained lifelong friends.\nSeries 6 (1968\u20131969).\nWhen Diana Rigg left the series in October 1967, the British network executives decided that the current series formula, despite resulting in popular success, could not be pursued further. Thus, they decided that a \"return to realism\" was appropriate for the sixth series (1968\u201369). Brian Clemens and Albert Fennell were replaced by John Bryce, producer of most of the Cathy Gale-era episodes.\nJohn Bryce had a difficult situation to handle. He had to find a replacement for Diana Rigg and shoot the first seven episodes of the new series, which were supposed to be shipped to the US together with the last eight Emma Peel colour episodes. Bryce signed his then-girlfriend, 20-year-old newcomer Linda Thorson, as the new female co-star and chose the name Tara King for her character. Linda Thorson played the role with more innocence in mind and at heart, and unlike the previous partnerships with Cathy Gale and Emma Peel, the writers allowed subtle hints of romance to blossom between Steed and Tara King. Tara King also differed from Steed's previous partners in that she was a fully fledged (albeit initially inexperienced) agent working for Steed's organisation; his previous partners had all been (in the words of the prologue used for American broadcasts of the first Rigg series) talented amateurs. Bryce wanted Tara to be blonde, so Linda Thorson's brown hair was bleached. However, the process badly damaged Linda Thorson's hair, so she had to wear wigs for the first third of her episodes, until her own hair grew back. Her natural brown hair was not seen until the episode, \"All Done with Mirrors.\"\nProduction of the first seven episodes of the sixth series began, but the financial problems and internal difficulties undermined John Bryce's effort. He only managed to complete three episodes: \"Invitation to a Killing\" (a 90-minute episode introducing Tara King), \"The Great, Great Britain Crime\" (some of its original footage was reused in the 1969 episode \"Homicide and Old Lace\"), and \"Invasion of the Earthmen\" (which survived relatively intact except for the scenes in which Tara wears a brown wig).\nAfter a rough cut screening of these episodes to studio executives, John Bryce was fired and Brian Clemens and Albert Fennell were summoned back. At their return, a fourth episode called \"The Murderous Connection\" was in its second day of production. After revising the script, it was renamed as \"The Curious Case of the Countless Clues\" and production resumed. Production of the episode \"Split!\", a leftover script from the Emma Peel colour series, proceeded. Two completely new episodes were also shot: \"Get-A-Way\", and \"Look (Stop Me If You've Heard This One) But There Were These Two Fellers\".\nDennis Spooner said of the event:&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Brian left \"The Avengers\" for about three episodes, someone took over, and when Brian came back, it was in a terrible state. He was faced with doing a rewrite on a film they'd already shot. The episode had a story error where Steed leaves for a destination. The villains then realise this and pursue him\u00a0\u2013 yet arrive there before Steed does. It was fixed by having a character ask Steed 'What took you so long?', to which he replies 'I came the pretty way'. \"You can only do that on \"The Avengers\" you see. It was just my favourite show to work on.\nBrian Clemens and Albert Fennell decided to film a new episode to introduce Tara King. This, the third episode filmed for the sixth series, was titled \"The Forget-Me-Knot\" and bade farewell to Emma Peel and introduced her successor, a trained but inexperienced agent named Tara King. It would be broadcast as the first episode of the sixth series. Tara debuts in dynamic style: when Steed is called to Headquarters, he is attacked and knocked down by trainee agent Tara King, who mistakes him for her training partner.\nNo farewell scenes for Emma Peel had been shot when Diana Rigg left the series. She was recalled for \"The Forget-Me-Knot\", through which Emma acts as Steed's partner as usual. Diana Rigg also filmed a farewell scene for Emma that appeared as the tag scene of the episode. It was explained that Emma's husband, Peter Peel, was found alive and rescued, and she left the British secret service to be with him. Emma visits Steed to say goodbye, and while leaving she passes Tara on the stairway giving the advice that \"he likes his tea stirred anti-clockwise\". Steed looks out of the window as a departing Emma enters the Bentley driven by Peter, who from a distance seems to resemble Steed (and was played by Steed's regular stunt double, with bowler hat and umbrella).\nJohn Bryce's original episode introducing Tara, \"Invitation to a Killing\", was revised as a regular 60-minute episode named \"Have Guns Will Haggle\". These episodes, together with \"Invasion of the Earthmen\" and the last eight Emma Peel colour episodes, were shipped to the US in February 1968.\nFor this series the government official who gave Steed his orders was depicted on screen. Mother, introduced in \"The Forget-Me-Knot,\" is a man in a wheelchair. The role was taken by Patrick Newell, who had played different roles in two earlier episodes, most recently in Series 5. Mother's headquarters would shift from place to place, including one episode in which his complete office was on the top level of a double-decker bus. Several James Bond films of the 1970s would make use of a similar gimmick for Bond's briefings.\nAdded later as a regular was Mother's mute Amazonian assistant, Rhonda, played by uncredited actress Rhonda Parker. There was one appearance by an agency official code-named \"Father\", a blind older woman played by Iris Russell. (Iris Russell had appeared in the series several times previously in other roles.) In one episode, \"Killer\", Steed is paired with Lady Diana Forbes Blakeney (Jennifer Croxton) while King is on holiday.\nScriptwriter Dennis Spooner later reflected: \"When I wrote 'Look (Stop Me If You've Heard This One) But There Were These Two Fellers', that was definitely the last series. They were going to make no more, so in that series we went right over the top; we went \"really\" weird, because they knew there weren't going to be any more\".\nDennis Spooner said the series \"worked because it became a parody on itself, almost. You can only do that so long.\" He attributes the overall success of the show to its light approach: \"We spoofed everything; we took \"Mission: Impossible\", \"Bad Day at Black Rock\", \"High Noon\", \"The Dirty Dozen\", \"The Birds\"... we took them all. The film buffs used to love it. There were always lines in it that people knew what we were talking about\".\nThe revised series continued to be broadcast in the US. The episodes with Linda Thorson as Tara King proved to be highly rated in the UK and overall in Europe. However, in the US, the ABC network chose to air it opposite the number-one show in the country at the time, \"Rowan and Martin's Laugh-In\". Steed and Tara King could not compete, and the show was cancelled in the US. Without this vital commercial backing, production could not continue in Britain either, and the series ended in May 1969. The final scene of the final episode (\"Bizarre\") has Steed and Tara King, champagne glasses in hand, accidentally launching themselves into orbit aboard a rocket, as Mother breaks the fourth wall and says to the audience \"They'll be back!\", before adding in shock \"They're unchaperoned up there!\"\nProduction.\nMusic.\nThe 1961 series featured a jazz-influenced theme by John Dankworth. Library music was used sparsely as a soundtrack, sometimes with variations based on the main theme. Dankworth's theme music was reworked for the third series. John Dankworth's first theme was recorded on the Columbia label, on a 45rpm single, and a new recording, similar to the reworked television theme was issued on Fontana in 1963. A very faithful cover version was released by Johnny Gregory.\nWhen Diana Rigg joined the series in 1965, the opening credits of the series were redesigned and new theme music by Laurie Johnson was introduced. This was based on a previously released title on LP, called \"The Shake\" (which capitalised on \"The Shake\" dance craze of the '60s). For the colour series (1967), a percussion section was added to accompany the new teaser sequence at the start of each episode. Laurie Johnson re-scored the theme when Linda Thorson joined the series, adding a counter-melody on trumpet, based on the leitmotif for Tara King from the final Diana Rigg episode \"The Forget-Me-Knot.\" The new theme debuted in the closing titles of the episode \"The Forget-Me-Knot,\" which introduced Linda Thorson. It was altogether more dynamic, and included a much more frenetic percussion section, for the revised teaser sequence. Importantly, the filmed episodes contained specially composed scores by Johnson. To accompany Steed's request, \"Mrs. Peel \u2013 we're needed!\", he composed a brief 'sting', and there was also a special theme for 'Emma'. For the 'Linda Thorson' series, a characteristic piece was composed to accompany the tag scene, at the end of each episode. Many of the most memorable cues from the Rigg/Thorson series, including the opening, and closing titles themes, and the 'Tag Scene' were released commercially on CD in 2009.\nOwing to a professional commitment to score for the film \"Hot Millions\" (starring Peter Ustinov and Maggie Smith), Laurie Johnson requested assistance from his keyboard player, Howard Blake, who scored some of the episodes of the final season, as well as additional music for other episodes which Laurie Johnson did not have time to complete. These were composed in a style remarkably similar to Laurie Johnson's. In 2011, to mark the 50th anniversary of the series, these almost-complete scores by Howard Blake\u2212including Laurie Johnson's themes for the main and end titles\u2014were issued on a double-CD set. Of the original Johnson theme, countless cover versions have been released on vinyl and CD, and the opening motif was retained on the series \"The New Avengers\".\nLaurie Johnson subsequently collaborated with Brian Clemens on other projects, including the theme for \"The New Avengers\".\nCars.\nThe cars used in the series became almost as famous as the actors. From the 4th series on, Steed's signature cars were six vintage, green 1926\u20131928 Bentley racing or town cars, including Blower Bentleys and Bentley Speed Sixes (although, uniquely, in \"The Thirteenth Hole\" he drives a Vauxhall 30-98). In the final series, he drove two yellow Rolls-Royces \u2013 a 1923 Rolls-Royce Silver Ghost and a 1927 Rolls-Royce New Phantom. Peel drove Lotus Elan convertibles (a white 1964 and a powder blue 1966), which, like her clothes, emphasised her independence and vitality. During the first Peel series (Series 4), each episode ended with a short, humorous scene of the duo leaving the scene of their most recent adventure in some unusual vehicle. Mother occasionally appeared in a silver Rolls-Royce. Tara King drove an AC 428 and a Lotus Europa. Lady Diana Forbes Blakeney drove an MGC Roadster.\nProduction team.\nSydney Newman, who would later go on to spearhead the creation of \"Doctor Who\" for the BBC, never received screen credit as the creator of \"The Avengers\". In his memoir, \"The Avengers and Me\", Patrick Macnee interviewed Newman about this. Newman explained that he never sought on-screen credit on the series because during his previous tenure at the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, such credits were not given, and he never thought to get one for \"The Avengers\".\nThe production team changed during the series' long run, particularly between the third and fourth series, but the influence of Brian Clemens was felt throughout. He wrote the second episode and became the series' most prolific scriptwriter. Succeeding producers Leonard White and John Bryce, Julian Wintle became the producer of the 4th series with Brian Clemens credited as associate producer and Albert Fennell credited as \"In charge of production\". For series 5, made by A.B.C. Television Films (which was created during the run-up to ABC Weekend TV and Associated-Rediffusion forming Thames TV) Clemens and Fennell became co-producers, with Wintle as executive producer. For series 6, after its initial producer John Bryce left, Clemens and Fennell returned as co-producers; early episodes also credit Julian Wintle as consultant to the series and Philip Levene as story consultant.\nRay Austin became the fight arranger for series 4 and 5, introducing kung fu to the series. Ray Austin had been training with Chee Soo and they worked techniques from Feng Shou kung fu and tai chi into the fight scenes and credit sequences. Ray Austin, Diana Rigg and Chee Soo were later awarded a Guinness world record as the first people to show kung fu on television. Later he became a prolific television director. Joe Dunne took over for series 6.\nEpisodes.\nSix series of \"The Avengers\" were made between 1961 and 1969. There was an enforced break in filming and transmission towards the end of series five due to financial problems. Television researcher Andrew Pixley and authors Paul Cornell, Martin Day and Keith Topping in their book \"The Avengers Dossier: The Unauthorised and Unofficial Guide\" consider the last eight episodes produced after the break as constituting a short series six, and therefore count seven series in total. Within the internal production of \"The Avengers\" the last eight episodes were considered to be a continuation of series five.\nReception.\nIn Canada and the United States.\nAlthough telerecordings of the second and third series were seen in Canada as early as 1963, the first two series of \"The Avengers\" were not broadcast on television in the United States. The American ABC purchased the rights to broadcast seasons 4 and 5 in the United States in 1965. The sale of \"The Avengers\" to United States television prompted a change in production style from the 405-line British multi-camera stand to the single-camera shooting method, originated on 35mm film.\nThe series' stunt man and stunt arranger Ray Austin expressed the opinion that the show's violence ultimately harmed its popular success in the United States. There \"The Avengers\" was given a late timeslot due to its violence: \"They did that with the first \"Avengers\" here [in the U.S.], with Diana Rigg. They put us on at 11:30 pm on CBS [\"sic\"], because it was too violent\". Austin goes on to explain that US television follows a \"different code\". Austin said that on \"The Avengers\" \"we were determined to do the show our way, the English way, and no one was going to stop us! And, indeed, no one did stop us. We never, never got to prime time. And it was our own faults, because we would not comply to the Midwest. That's where the money comes from in this country, nowhere else. Forget Los Angeles, forget New York\u2014you have to aim for the Midwest. If the Midwest watches your show, you've made it\". In fact the first and second series of Emma Peel episodes mainly aired at 10:00 pm on ABC. The final Rigg episodes and all the Linda Thorson episodes mainly ran at 7:30 pm, also on ABC.\nAmerican censors objected to some content, in particular the episode \"A Touch of Brimstone\", which featured a modern-day version of the Hellfire Club and climaxed with Emma being dressed in a skimpy corset costume with spiked collar and high-heeled boots to become the Queen of Sin, and being attacked with a whip by guest star Peter Wyngarde. The American broadcast network refused to air it. In total five episodes from the first Emma Peel series were not initially broadcast by ABC. These were: \"A Surfeit of H2O\", \"Silent Dust\" (which featured Emma being attacked with a horsewhip), \"Quick-Quick Slow Death\", \"A Touch of Brimstone\" and \"Honey for the Prince\" (in which Emma performed the dance of the seven veils), although they were seen in later syndicated repeats.\nEarlier Cathy Gale and Venus Smith episodes had aired in Canada before the arrival of Mrs. Peel. US audiences saw the 1962\u20131964 Gale and Smith episodes of the series for the first time in the early 1990s when they were broadcast on the A&amp;E Network. No Keel episode of the series was ever repeatedly broadcast outside Britain, contributing to the fact nearly all first-series episodes are now lost, and even in the UK only one surviving episode, \"The Frighteners\", was rebroadcast (as part of a run of classic episodes on Channel 4 in early 1993, otherwise mostly consisting of Gale episodes).\nHome media.\nOnly three complete episodes from the show's first series, plus a portion of another episode, are known to exist, as 16mm film telerecordings. These are \"The Frighteners\" (an extract of which is playing on a television in the film \"Quadrophenia\"), \"Girl on the Trapeze\", which was found in the UCLA Film and Television Archive via an internet search of their on-line database, and \"Tunnel of Fear\", which was found in 2016. Additionally, part of the show's first episode was also found in the United States. The footage is of the episode's first 21 minutes, up to the first commercial break.\nAll series 2 and series 3 episodes survive as 16mm telerecordings. These have been released to DVD, as have all of the Emma Peel and Tara King episodes, which were shot on film. The two earlier-found surviving complete Keel episodes, plus the remnant of the first episode, have also been released in the UK and US, but are not currently available in the US. None of the original videotapes of series 1, 2 and 3 survive.\nFrom the late 1990s to the early 2000s, A&amp;E TV Home Entertainment (under license from Canal+ Image International) released the remaining surviving series on Region 1 DVD in North America, with newly remastered picture and sound quality.\nSeries 4, 5 and 6 were remastered and released on Blu-ray by Studio Canal.\nSequel.\n\"The New Avengers\".\nThe sustained popularity of the Tara King episodes in France led to a 1975 French television advertisement for Laurent-Perrier champagne in which Thorson and Macnee reprised their roles. The advertisement's success spurred financing interest in France for new episodes of \"The Avengers\".\nThe result was a new series, \"The New Avengers\". Patrick Macnee reprised the role of Steed, with two new partners, Mike Gambit (Gareth Hunt) and Purdey (Joanna Lumley). It aired on ITV in the UK in 1976\u20131977, CTV in Canada, CBS in the United States (in 1978\u201379) and TF1 in France (series 1 in 1976\u20131977 and series 2 in 1979). The final four episodes were almost completely produced by Canadian interests and were filmed there. In some markets they carried the title \"The New Avengers in Canada\".\nAlthough Macnee was the only actor from the original series to reprise his role, archival footage of Diana Rigg allowed Emma Peel to make a cameo appearance in a second-season episode \"K is for Kill: The Tiger Awakes\", while Macnee's first co-star, Ian Hendry, made a guest appearance as a different character in the episode \"To Catch a Rat\".\nSpin-offs.\nNovels.\nA number of original novels based on the series were published in the 1960s. The first by Douglas Enefer, published by Consul Books, was the only 60s novel to feature Cathy Gale. Panther Books published four novels written by John Garforth featuring Emma Peel in the United Kingdom in 1967; Berkley Medallion Books reprinted these in the United States. After Panther stopped publishing \"Avengers\" novels in the UK, Berkley Medallion continued publishing original novels of their own: one featuring Peel and four featuring Tara King for the US market only; three by Keith Laumer in 1968; and two by Norman Daniels 1968/69. Berkley Medallion later re-printed all nine novels with new covers that featured photos of both Rigg and Thorson, regardless of which \"Avengers\" girl appeared in the novel. The two novels published by Hodder and Stoughton in 1965/66 were co-written by Patrick Macnee, making him one of the first actors to write licensed spin-off fiction of their own shows. The Macnee novels, \"Deadline\" and \"Dead Duck\", were reprinted in the UK by Titan Books in standard paperback in 1994 and in France by Huitieme Art (1995 &amp; 1996). They were also published in the US for the first time by TV Books in 1998. Titan reissued the books in trade paperback format (with the same covers) to coincide with the release of the 1998 feature film.\nThe 1990 novel \"Too Many Targets\" by John Peel featured all of Steed's partners (David Keel, Cathy Gale, Emma Peel and Tara King) with the exception of Venus Smith and Dr Martin King.\nA short story by Peter Leslie entitled \"What's a Ghoul Like You Doing in a Place Like This?\" appeared in \"The Television Crimebusters Omnibus\", a hardback anthology edited by Peter Haining, first published by Orion in 1994 (this Steed and Tara story first appeared in the 1969 UK Avengers annual, from Atlas publications). Both of the Macnee/Leslie UK paperback titles were translated and published in Portugal in 1967 as \"Os Vingadores: O Dia Depois De Amanha\" (\"Deadline\") and \"Os Vingadores: O Pato Morto\" (\"Dead Duck\") by Deaga. All four UK John Garforth Panther book paperbacks were translated and published by Roman in France (1967), a paperback omnibus edition was published in 1998 by Fleuve Noir. Three of the Garforth paperbacks were also translated and published by Heyne in Germany (1967/68) (\"Heil Harris!\" was not translated for obvious reasons) and a German hardback omnibus edition of the three titles was published by Lichtenberg (1968), reprinted in paperback by Heyne in 1998. All four titles were also translated and published in the Netherlands by Bruna (1967) and in Chile by Zig-Zag (1968). \nComics.\nThe first UK Avengers comic strips, featuring Steed and Cathy Gale, first appeared in regional TV listings magazines \"Look Westward\" and \"The Viewer\" from 14 September 1963 to 9 May 1964 (and later in 1964, re-printed in the \"Manchester Evening News\"). This run consisted of four serials.\nSteed and Mrs Peel comic strips began in Polystyle Publications' \"TV Comic\" in issue #720, dated 2 October 1965, beginning after the TV debut of Emma Peel, and ran until issue #771, dated 24 September 1966 \u2013 this run consisted of 10 serials plus one 4-page one-off in \"TV Comic Holiday Special\" (June 1966). At that point the rights were sold to publishers D.C. Thomson &amp; Co. Ltd, where the next version of the strip appeared in issue #199, dated 10 December 1966, of \"Diana\" the popular paper for girls. Its run ended in issue #224, dated 2 June 1967, with art by Emilio Frejo and Juan Gonzalez Alacrojo \u2013 this run consisted of 8 serials.\nEarlier, \"The Growing Up of Emma Peel\" comic strip had appeared in \"June and Schoolfriend\" comic from issue #52, dated 29 January 1966, to issue #63, dated 16 April 1966. This had featured the adventures of 14-year-old Emma Knight and was run concurrent with the \"TV Comic\" strip and consisted of 11 instalments.\nThe Avengers returned to \"TV Comic\" issue #877, dated 5 October 1968, just after Tara King debuted on TV, the Tara &amp; Steed strip continued until issue #1077, dated 5 August 1972. This run consisted of 28 serials plus a 4-page one-off in \"TV Comic Holiday Special 1972\". Also in 1966 Thorpe &amp; Porter published a 68-page Avengers comic featuring Steed &amp; Peel, with original art by Mick Anglo and Mick Austin \u2014 this consisted of four 16-page stories.\nA few \"Avengers\"-related comic books have been published in the USA. They are not named \"The Avengers\" because the rights to the names \"Avengers\" and \"New Avengers\" are held by Marvel Comics for use with their Avengers comics depicting a team of superheroes called \"The Avengers\". Gold Key Comics published one issue of \"John Steed Emma Peel\" in 1968 (subtitled \"The Avengers\" on the Indicia page), which included two newly coloured and reformatted \"The Avengers\" strips from \"TV Comic\".\nA 3-issue limited entitled \"Steed and Mrs. Peel\" appeared in 1990\u20131992 under the Acme Press/Eclipse Comics imprint; it featured a three-part story, \"The Golden Game\" in issues #1\u20133, by Grant Morrison and a two-part story, in issues #2 &amp; #3, \"A Deadly Rainbow\" by Anne Caulfield; both strips had art by Ian Gibson. Boom! Studios reprinted this series in six issues in early 2012, and later published a new ongoing series written by Mark Waid and Caleb Monroe which lasted 12 issues. Boom! subsequently announced a six-issue follow-up series, \"Steed and Mrs. Peel: We're Needed\", which was launched in the summer of 2014. Despite issue #1 showing \"1 of 6\", only 3 issues were produced (\"2 of 3\" and \"3 of 3\" showing on the other issues, with the cover for issue #3 being the one originally planned for issue #4 which was planned to be the start of another 3-issue story).\nIn the UK, where hardback annuals are traditionally produced for sale at Christmas, The Avengers first appeared in \"TV Crimebusters Annual\" (1962) and featured a 7-page comic strip with Dr David Keel titled \"The Drug Pedlar\". Atlas Publications produced three \"The Avengers\" hardback Annuals for 1967, 1968 and 1969, which also featured original Avengers comic strips featuring Steed, Emma Peel, and Tara King, as well as text stories.\nThe \"TV Comic\" Avengers strips and the 1966 Avengers comic and a few comic strips from the Annuals have been translated and published in Germany, the Netherlands, France, and Chile.\nThe Avengers also have made a number of cameo appearances in comics over the years:\nStage play.\nA stage adaptation was produced in Britain in 1971, written by TV series veterans Brian Clemens and Terence Feely, and directed by Leslie Phillips. It starred Simon Oates as Steed, Sue Lloyd as new partner Hannah Wild, and Kate O'Mara as villainess Madame Gerda. All three had guest roles in the original series.\nA character named Hana Wilde (played by Charlotte Rampling) had essentially acted as Steed's partner in series five's \"The Superlative Seven\", an episode in which Emma Peel appears only briefly. According to John Peel in his overview of \"The Superlative Seven\", Charlotte Rampling was rumoured to be grooming up to replace Diana Rigg in this story, but nothing ever came of that\".\nRadio series.\nA radio series was transmitted between 6 December 1971 and 28 December 1973 on Springbok Radio, the English-language service of the South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC); it was recorded at Sonovision Studios in Johannesburg, produced by Dave Gooden, the original TV scripts were adapted and directed by Tony Jay, for the first six months and Dennis Folbigge for the remainder. South Africa did not have national television until 1976. The episodes were adapted from both Emma Peel and Tara King episodes (with Tara changed to Emma Peel throughout). The Avengers were played by two British expatriate actors, Donald Monat as Steed and Diane Appleby as Mrs Peel, with Hugh Rouse as the tongue-in-cheek narrator. The stories were adapted into five-episode serials under Tony Jay and six- and seven-episode serials under Dennis Folbigge, of approximately 15 minutes each (including adverts) and stripped across the week, Monday-Friday, on Springbok Radio.\nCurrently only 19 complete serials survive, all from reel-to-reel off-air recordings made by John Wright in 1972. Also, the first three episodes of a remake of \"Escape in Time\" currently exist. Episodes 1 and 2 are copies from the original Sonovision tapes, and episode 3 is from an off-air recording, on audio cassette, made by Barbara Peterson; the rest of this serial is still missing. These episodes are also known to have been transmitted in New York on station WBAI on 99.5 FM, from 1977 to the early 1990s, and are currently being transmitted on Miami station WRGP on early Monday mornings.\nCopies from the original off-air recordings have been restored by Alan and Alys Hayes, and can be heard at their \"The Avengers Declassified\" website and its sister website \"Avengers on the Radio\".\nMany more serials were broadcast during its two-year run on South African radio; it is thought 83 serials were made and transmitted, but no other episodes are known to exist at present.\nFilm.\nPlans for a feature-length adaptation based upon the series circulated during the 1960s, 1980s and 1990s, with Mel Gibson at one point being considered a front-runner for the role of Steed. Ultimately, the 1998 film, starring Uma Thurman as Emma Peel and Ralph Fiennes as John Steed, with Sean Connery as the villain, received extremely negative reviews from critics and fans, and is a notorious commercial failure.\nAudio.\nIn June 2013, Big Finish Productions signed a license with StudioCanal to produce full-cast audio productions of 12 lost first-season episodes. The main cast includes Julian Wadham as Steed, Anthony Howell as Dr David Keel, and Lucy Briggs-Owen as Carol Wilson. The stories are adapted for audio by John Dorney.\nIn January 2014, Volume One, containing the first four stories, (\"Hot Snow\", \"Brought to Book\", \"Square Root of Evil\" and \"One for the Mortuary\") was released. Volume Two, containing the next four stories, (\"Ashes of Roses\", \"Please Don't Feed the Animals\", \"The Radioactive Man\" and \"Dance with Death\") was released in July 2014. Volume Three, containing the next four stories, was released in January 2015.\nIn March 2014, Big Finish extended the audio recreation programme to include all 26 season one episodes, including the then-two extant stories. A total of seven boxed sets were released.\nProposed reboots.\nIn a 2023 interview, Charlie Higson said he and Paul Whitehouse had been offered an opportunity to helm a new series, but had declined.\nOn 18 January 2024, it was announced that Mickey Down and Konrad Kay were developing a reboot for StudioCanal.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "31524", "revid": "44356317", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31524", "title": "Triathlon", "text": "Swimming, cycling, and distance running race\nA triathlon is an endurance multisport race consisting of swimming, cycling, and running over various distances. Triathletes compete for fastest overall completion time, racing each segment sequentially with the time transitioning between the disciplines included. The word is of Greek origin, from (), 'three', and (), 'competition'.\nThe sport originated in the late 1970s in Southern California as sports clubs and individuals developed the sport. This history has meant that variations of the sport were created and still exist. It also led to other three-stage races using the name triathlon despite not being continuous or not consisting of swim, bike, and run elements.\nTriathletes train to achieve endurance, strength, and speed. The sport requires focused persistent and periodised training for each of the three disciplines, as well as combination workouts and general strength conditioning.\nHistory.\nThe evolution of triathlon as a distinct sport is difficult to trace with precision. Many, including triathlon historian and author Scott Tinley, consider events in early 20th-century France to be the beginnings of triathlon, with many three-element multisport events of differing composition appearing, all called by different names. The earliest record for an event was from 1901 in Joinville-le-Pont, Val-de-Marne, it called itself \"Les Trois Sports\" (The Three Sports). It was advertised as an event for \"the sportsmen of the time\" and consisted of a run, a bicycle, and a canoe segment. By 19 June 1921, the event in Joinville-le-Pont had become more like a standard triathlon, with the canoe segment being replaced with a swim. According to the newspaper \"L'Auto\", the race consisted of a run, a bike ride, and the crossing of the river Marne, all staged consecutively and without a break. Throughout the 1920s, other bike, run, and swim events appeared in different cities, such as the \"Course des Trois Sports\" in Marseille and \"La Course des D\u00e9brouillards\" in Poissy. These multisport events continued to slowly spread and grow in popularity; by 1934, \"Les Trois Sports\" was being hosted in the city of La Rochelle, though it consisted of three distinct events, swimming a channel crossing, a bike competition around the harbour of La Rochelle and the parc Laleu, and a run in the stadium Andr\u00e9-Barbeau. Throughout this growth with new events appearing, no unified rules ever existed, and as a whole, triathlon remained a minority event on the world stage.\nModern beginnings.\nThe first modern swim/bike/run event was held at Mission Bay, San Diego, California, on September 25, 1974. The race was conceived and directed by two members of the San Diego Track Club, Jack Johnstone and Don Shanahan. Johnstone recalls that he was a part of the '70s jogging craze in America and that after entering a few races, he was not regaining his \"mediocre fitness\" despite having been a member of the 1957 Collegiate and AAU All-American swim teams. Then in 1973, Johnstone learned of the Dave Pain Birthday Biathlon, a run followed by what was billed as a quarter-mile (0.4\u00a0km) swim (the actual distance was only between 200 and 300\u00a0yards). The following year, after competing in the event for the second time and placing in the top 10, Johnstone desired more of this style of race and with equal emphasis on the swim. So, he petitioned the chairman of the San Diego Track Club, who told him he would add a race to the club calendar. The rest of the race was up to Johnstone to organise, though, and at the same time, he was to contact Don Shanahan, so there would not be too many \"weird\" races on the club schedule. Shanahan told Johnstone that he wanted to include a biking leg to the race; whilst hesitant, Johnstone agreed to the addition. When naming the event, the pair used the unofficially agreed naming system for multisport events, already used for pentathlon, heptathlon, and decathlon. So, they used the Greek prefix \"tri\" (three) for the number of events, followed by the already familiar \"athlon\", hence naming the event the Mission Bay Triathlon. Neither founder had heard of the French events; both believed their race was a unique idea.\nOn Wednesday, September 25, 1974, the race started. It began with a run of a loop, followed by biking twice around Fiesta Island for a total of . Entrants would then get off the bikes, take their shoes off, and run into the water to swim to the mainland. That was followed by running in bare feet, then swimming again along the bay, then one last swim up to the entrance of Fiesta Island, and a final crawl up a steep dirt bank to finish. Most participants were not skilled swimmers, so Johnstone recruited his 13-year-old son to float on his surfboard and act as lifeguard. Some participants took longer than expected, and it began to get dark as they finished their swims. Shanahan recalls they pulled up a few cars and turned on the headlights so the athletes could see. Johnstone and Shanahan were surprised by the large number of entrants (46), mainly coming from local running clubs. Two notable entrants, Judy and John Collins, four years later founded the event that brought international attention to the new sport: the Hawaii Ironman.\nEuropean migration.\nThe first European triathlon was held on 30 August 1980 in Plze\u0148, Czechoslovakia. The Netherlands, Belgium, and West Germany followed, each of them hosting an event in 1981, but media coverage of these events was almost nonexistent.\nThen in 1982, event organiser IMG, working in partnership with the American channel CBS (direct competitor of ABC, which held the exclusive rights to Hawaii), created a new event that would take place in Europe. The initial aim was to establish a new premier competition, the European Triathlon, with the goal of being of the same size and prestige to directly compete with that of Hawaii. Originally, the event was to be hosted in Monaco, but with the death of Princess Grace in September 1982, the previous agreements fell through. IMG refused to cancel the event, so it was reorganised to be hosted in Nice, France. The first Nice Triathlon was held on 20 November 1982, where 57 competitors took the start, for an ill-defined competition that consisted of of swimming, of cycling, and running a marathon. In December of that year the national television station France 2 broadcast a program, \"Voyage au bout de la souffrance\" (\"Journey to the End of Suffering\") which detailed the events of the Nice Triathlon. This program introduced the sport to the general public. Some fans of traditional sports strongly criticised this new practice, as seven of the entrants were hospitalised due to the swim, as the temperature of the Mediterranean was only . Despite this criticism, IMG's plan succeeded and throughout the 1980s. The Nice Triathlon was, alongside Hawaii, one of the two important long-distance races each year for both prize money and media attention.\nThe year 1985 had the creation of the first international triathlon structure, the European Triathlon Union (ETU), with the objectives to federate the triathlon structures in each European country and to act as a counterbalance to American triathlon in the creation of a future worldwide federation. The following year, the 11 nations that composed the ETU met in Brussels to standardise the national structures of each European country. During this time, France dominated discussions, as it was the only federation recognised by its own National Olympic Committee. With the legitimacy from CONADET, forerunner of the French Triathlon Federation (FFTri), which has been organising triathlon in France since 1984, the French system became standard all over Europe.\nA global federation.\nThe first attempt to create a global triathlon entity was the Triathlon Federation International (TFI), it had only 22 members, most of which were national European federations. But immediately, fights of influences broke out between the European and UK-American federations over many issues, particularly in view of a favourable vote system for the ETU; this caused immediate fracturing and the TFI never fully establish itself.\nAround the same time, Canadian Les McDonald held talks with Juan Antonio Samaranch, then president of the International Olympic Committee. Samaranch had already declared his intention to add triathlon to the Olympic Games as fast as possible, and assured that triathlon could appear as a demonstration sport at the 1992 Olympic Games in Barcelona, but only under the auspices of the International Union of Modern Pentathlon and Biathlon (UIPMB). Many within the triathlon community were unhappy with the arrangement, wishing for their own federation not to be held as part of UIPMB. Unable to accept the offer, Samaranch established an Olympic working committee for triathlon in an effort to form a consensus on an Olympic route for the sport. McDonald was selected as president of the committee, while Sweden's Sture Jonasson was elected as secretary.\nThen in February 1989, an informal meeting was held in Vancouver, Canada, where members of the working committee worked nonstop for a week on the statutes and regulations of the future International Triathlon Union (ITU). Then on 1 April 1989, 30 national federations attended the first ITU Congress in Avignon, France. After further discussions on the way forward to reach the Olympics, including the refusal to follow the path of the UIPMB and how triathlon should develop both economically and as a sport, the Congress endorsed the creation of the ITU and elected its first executive committee. McDonald was elected president. The city of Avignon was also given the honour of hosting the first world championship.\nIn 1991, the IOC recognized the ITU as the sole governing body for the sport of triathlon at its 97th session in Birmingham, UK. In 1993, the Pan American Games approved triathlon for competition at the 1995 Pan Am Games in Mar del Plata, Argentina. Then in September 1994, triathlon was added to the Olympic program as a medal earning sport at the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney, Australia.\nOrganisations.\nThe International Triathlon Union (now known as World Triathlon) was founded in 1989 as the international governing body of the sport, with the chief goal, at that time, of putting triathlon on the Olympic program. The World Triathlon sanctions and organises the World Triathlon Series and the World Triathlon Cup races each year, with annual world champions crowned each year for elite professional triathletes, junior pro triathletes, and age-group athletes. World Triathlon races are conducted in a draft legal format for the bike leg, whereas drafting is not permitted at the amateur level. In addition, the ITU has a Long-Distance Triathlon series.\nThe World Triathlon Corporation (WTC) is a private company that sanctions and organises the Ironman and Ironman 70.3 races each year. These races serve as qualifying events for their own annual world championships. The Ironman World Championship is held annually in Kailua-Kona, Hawaii, in October, while the Ironman 70.3 World Championship is held in September and changes location each year. The \"Ironman\" and \"Iron\" brands are property of the WTC. Therefore, long-distance multisport events organized by groups other than the WTC may not officially be called \"Ironman\" or \"Iron\" races. For its part, the ITU does not sanction WTC races; however, USA Triathlon (USAT) uses a combination of World Triathlon and WTC rules to sanction WTC's branded events.\nMany other organisations exist beginning with local clubs that may host a single small race once per year to companies like the Challenge Family brand that produces long-distance events around the world, which includes events like Challenge Roth. International Ultra-Triathlon Association (IUTA) is the official governing body of Ultratriathlon, which involves triathlon in distances longer than an iron-distance race. Additionally, each nation, generally, has a sanctioning body for triathlon events in their respective country with regard to athletes competing and qualifying for Olympic competition.\nThe Professional Triathletes Organisation (PTO), an athlete-owned body that represents non-drafting professional triathletes, was launched in 2016. The organisation focuses on promoting the athletes and their performances with high-quality international broadcasts. In 2022 The PTO launched the PTO Tour, the first series of pro-triathlon 'majors' each with a prize purse of $1M including the PTO Canadian Open, Collins Cup and PTO US Open. A unique aspect of the Professional Triathletes Organization (PTO) is that it is an athlete-owned entity.\nConflict.\nTwo major rule making bodies, the ITU and WTC, had an overlap of rules and authority, an issue which began to create conflict in the 2000s. This culminated in 2005 when the ITU and USAT asked all national triathlon federations to refuse to continue sanctioning any WTC events. The reasons for this stemmed from WTC not recognising the ITU as the sport's governing body as WTC was attempting to set up their own federation. Furthermore, ITU and USAT argued against supporting WTC because they were a profit driven organisation, that it was directly conflicting with ITU titles, such as the long and standard distance world championship, and that the WTC was not following World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) rules. If ITU member nations did not comply with International Olympic Committee (IOC) Charter rules they risked being excluded from the Olympic program. However, in 2006, the ITU backed down on its stance allowing national federations to once again sanction WTC events. This was due to an out-of-court settlement days before a lawsuit was to be argued at the Court of Arbitration for Sport. This settlement had a large effect on WTC races, including WADA membership for the WTC and out-of-competition testing for elite athletes.\nSince 2008, coinciding with leadership changes at both the ITU and WTC, the two organisations have been steadily working together. Efforts in 2012 and 2014 resulted in the announcement that Ironman would standardise the rule set for its 2015 races and would start the unification toward ITU rules on long-distance racing with specific interest on the drafting and penalty rules.\nIn 2017, the ITU and WTC signed a memorandum of understanding in which the two organisations stated they will:\nRace formats.\nTriathlons longer than full distance are classed as ultra-triathlons.\nTriathlons are not necessarily restricted to these prescribed distances. Distances can be any combination of distance set by race organizers to meet various distance constraints or to attract a certain type of athlete.\nThe standard Olympic distance of 1.5/40/10 km (0.93/24.8/6.2 miles) was created by longtime triathlon race director Jim Curl in the mid-1980s, after he and partner Carl Thomas produced the U.S. Triathlon Series (USTS) between 1982 and 1997.\nSprint triathlons are the most common triathlon distance in the United States. In 2022, for example, there were 839 USAT sanctioned sprint triathlons, more than all other distances combined.\nIn addition to the above distances, two new long-distance events have appeared, the 111 and 222 events. The 111 distance is swimming, bicycling and running, totalling . The 222 distance is double that.\nMost triathlons are individual events. Another format is relay triathlons, where a team of competitors take turns to compete at a race; each competitor must do a segment of swimming, cycling and running. The World Triathlon Mixed Relay Championships began with two separate classifications for men and women. In 2009, it adopted a 4\u00d74 mixed relay format, where each team has two men and two women. The triathlon at the Youth Olympic Games also has a 4\u00d7 mixed relay since 2010, and the event was introduced at the 2020 Summer Olympics.\nThe World Triathlon accepts a 5% margin of error in the cycle and run course distances. Though there can be some variation in race distances, particularly among short triathlons, most triathlons conform to one of those above standards.\nRace organization.\nIn general, participation in a triathlon requires an athlete to register and sign up in advance of the actual race. After registration, racers are often provided a race number, colored swim cap, and, if the event is being electronically timed, a timing band. Athletes will either be provided or briefed on details of the course, rules, and any problems to look out for (road conditions, closures, traffic lights, aid stations). At a major event, such as an Ironman or a long course championship, triathletes may be required to set up and check-in their bike in the transition area a day or two before the race start, leaving it overnight and under guard.\nOn the day of the race, before the start of competition, athletes will generally be provided with a bike rack to hold their bicycle and a small section of ground space for shoes, clothing, etc. in the transition area. In some triathlons, there are two transition areas, one for the swim/bike change, then one for the bike/run change at a different location.\nRacers are generally categorized into separate professional and amateur categories. Amateurs, who make up the large majority of triathletes, are often referred to as \"age groupers\" since they are typically further classified by sex and age; which offers the opportunity to compete against others of one's own gender and age group. The age groups are defined in five- or ten-year intervals. There is typically a lower age limit; which can vary from race to race. In some triathlons, heavier amateur athletes may have the option to compete against others closer to their own weight since weight is often considered an impediment to speed. As an example, under USA Triathlon rules, \"Clydesdale\" athletes are those men over , while \"Athena\" athletes are women over . Other races and organizations can choose whether or not to offer Clydesdale- and Athena-type divisions and set their own weight standards.\nDepending on the type and size of the race, there may be any of the following methods implemented to start the race. In a mass start, all athletes enter the water and begin the competition following a single start signal. In wave start events, smaller groups of athletes begin the race every few minutes. An athlete's wave is usually determined either by age group or by predicted swim time. Wave starts are more common in shorter races where a large number of amateur athletes are competing. Another option is individual time trial starts, where athletes enter the water one at a time, a few seconds apart.\nThe swim leg can occur in any available body of water, whether a natural body of water or a swimming pool. Swim legs not occurring in a swimming pool are considered open water swimming where the course typically proceeds around a series of marked buoys before athletes exit the water near the transition area. Racers exit out of the water, enter the transition area, and change from their swim gear and into their cycling gear. Competition and pressure for faster times have led to the development of specialized triathlon clothing that is adequate for both swimming and cycling, allowing many racers to have a transition that consists of only removing their wetsuit, cap, and goggles and pulling on a helmet and cycling shoes. In some cases, racers leave their cycling shoes attached to their bicycle pedals and slip their feet into them while riding. Some triathletes don't wear socks, decreasing their time spent in transition even more.\nThe cycling stage proceeds around a marked course, typically on public roads. In many cases, especially smaller triathlons, roads are not closed to automobiles; however, traffic coordinators are often present to help control traffic. Typically, the cycling stage finishes back at the same transition area. Racers enter the transition area, rack their bicycles, and quickly change into running shoes before heading out for the final stage. The running stage usually ends at a separate finish line near the transition area.\nIn most races, \"aid stations\" located on the bike and run courses provide water and energy drinks to the athletes as they pass by. Aid stations at longer events may often provide various types of food as well, including such items as energy bars, energy gels, fruit, cookies, soup, and ice.\nOnce the triathletes have completed the event, there is typically another aid station for them to get water, fruit, and other post-race refreshments. Occasionally, at the end of larger or longer events, the provided amenities and post-race celebrations may be more elaborate.\nRules of triathlon.\nWhile specific rules for triathlon can vary depending on the governing body (e.g. World Triathlon, USA Triathlon), as well as for an individual race venue, there are some basic universal rules. Traditionally, triathlon is an individual sport and each athlete is competing against the course and the clock for the best time. As such, athletes are not allowed to receive assistance from anyone else outside the race, with the exception of race-sanctioned aid volunteers who distribute food and water on the course.\nTriathlons are timed in five sequential sections:\nResults are usually posted on official websites and will show for each triathlete his/her swim time; cycle time (with transitions included); run time; and total time. Some races also post transition times separately.\nOther rules of triathlon vary from race to race and generally involve descriptions of allowable equipment (for example, wetsuits are allowed in USAT events in the swimming stage of some races when the water temperature is below ), and prohibitions against interference between athletes. Additionally, the use of flippers or other swim propulsion and flotation aids are illegal in triathlon and can result in disqualification.\nOne rule involving the cycle leg is that the competitor's helmet must be donned before the competitor mounts (or even takes possession of, in certain jurisdictions) the bike, and it must remain on until the competitor has dismounted; the competitor may not be required to wear the helmet when not on the bicycle (e.g. while repairing a mechanical problem). Failure to comply with this rule will result in disqualification. Additionally, while on the bike course, all bicycles shall be propelled only by human force and human power. Other than pushing a bicycle, any propulsive action brought on by use of the hands is prohibited. Should a competitor's bike malfunction they can proceed with the race as long as they are doing so with their bicycle in tow. There are also strict rules regarding the 'bike mount' line. Competitors may not begin riding their bicycle out of transition until they are over a clearly marked line. Mounting the bike prior to this may incur a penalty (example: a 15-second time penalty at the London 2012 Olympics was imposed on Jonathan Brownlee, a competitor from Great Britain, for mounting his bike too early.)\nOther time penalties can be incurred during the race for, among other things, drafting on the bike in a non-drafting race, improper passing, littering on course, and unsportsmanlike conduct.\nTriathlon and fitness.\nParticipants in triathlon often use the sport to improve or maintain their physical fitness. With each sport being an endurance event, training for a triathlon provides cardiovascular exercise benefits. Additionally, triathletes encounter fewer injuries than those who only use running as part of their exercise routine due to the incorporation of low impact swim and bike training.\nTriathletes spend many hours training for competitions, like other endurance event participants. There are three components that have been researched to improve endurance sports performance; aerobic capacity, lactate threshold, and economy. Injuries that are incurred from long hours of a single activity are not as common in triathlon as they are in single sport events. The cross-training effect that athletes achieve from training for one sport by doing a second activity applies to triathlon training. Additional activities that triathletes perform for cross-training benefits are yoga, pilates, and weight training.\nSwimming.\nTriathletes will often use their legs less vigorously and more carefully than other swimmers, conserving their leg muscles for the cycle and run to follow. Many triathletes use altered swim strokes to compensate for turbulent, aerated water and to conserve energy for a long swim. In addition, the majority of triathlons involve open-water (outdoor) swim stages, rather than pools with lane markers. As a result, triathletes in the swim stage must jockey for position, and can gain some advantage by drafting, following a competitor closely to swim in their slipstream. Triathletes will often use \"dolphin kicking\" and diving to make headway against waves, and body surfing to use a wave's energy for a bit of speed at the end of the swim stage. Also, open-water swims necessitate \"sighting\": raising the head to look for landmarks or buoys that mark the course. A modified stroke allows the triathlete to lift the head above water to sight without interrupting the swim or wasting energy.\nBecause open water swim areas are often cold and because wearing a wetsuit provides a competitive advantage, specialized triathlon wetsuits have been developed in a variety of styles to match the conditions of the water. For example, wetsuits that are sleeveless and cut above the knee are designed for warmer waters, while still providing buoyancy. Wetsuits are legal in sanctioned events at which the surface water temperature is or less. In non-sanctioned events or in \"age group\" classes where most racers are simply participating for the enjoyment of the sport instead of vying for official triathlon placing, wetsuits can often be used at other temperatures. Race directors will sometimes discourage or ban wetsuits if the water temperature is above due to overheating that can occur while wearing a wetsuit. Other rules have been implemented by race organizers regarding both wetsuit thickness as well as the use of \"swim skins;\" which need to be considered by those participating in future triathlons. Some triathlon sanctioning bodies have placed limits on the thickness of the wetsuit material. Under World Triathlon and some national governing bodies' rules no wetsuit may have a thickness of more than .\nCycling.\nTriathlon cycling can differ from most professional bicycle racing depending on whether drafting is allowed during competition. In some competitions, like those governed by USA Triathlon and the World Triathlon Corporation, drafting is not allowed, and thus the cycling portion more closely resembles individual time trial racing. In other races, such as those in the World Triathlon Series and World Triathlon Cup racing, drafting and the formation of pelotons are legal. This places an emphasis on running performance as several athletes will enter the bike to run transition at the same time due to drafting.\nTriathlon bicycles are generally optimized for aerodynamics, having special handlebars called aero-bars or tri-bars, aerodynamic wheels, and other components. Triathlon bikes use a specialized geometry, including a steep seat-tube angle both to improve aerodynamics and to spare muscle groups needed for running. At the end of the bike segment, triathletes also often cycle with a higher cadence (revolutions per minute), which serves in part to keep the muscles loose and flexible for running.\nRunning.\nThe primary distinguishing feature of running in a triathlon is that it occurs after the athlete has already been exercising in two other disciplines for an extended period of time, so many muscles are already tired. The effect of switching from cycling to running can be profound; first-time triathletes are often astonished at their muscle weakness, which may be caused by lactate accumulation and the bizarre, sometimes painful sensation in their thighs a few hundred yards into the run, and discover that they run at a much slower pace than they are accustomed to in training. Triathletes train for this phenomenon through transition workouts known as \"bricks\": back-to-back workouts involving two disciplines, most commonly cycling and running.\nTransition.\nThe change over from sport to sport takes place in a designated transition area. The transition provides a staging area where bicycles, running shoes, hydration and other gear is set up ready to be used during the course of the event. The first transition, known as \"T1\", is between the swimming and bicycle segments of the race. The second transition, \"T2\", is between the bicycle and running segments. Most events have one common transition area for both T1 and T2, while some point to point events have two separate transition areas. The time spent in transition is a timed segment and contributes towards the overall finishing time of the event. Races can hinge on transition skills, either by gaining or losing time in transition itself, or because of time penalties taken for faulty changeovers. As such, transition is commonly described during races as the 'fourth discipline.'\nNotable events.\nWorld Triathlon sanctioned events.\nOlympics.\nThe sport made its debut on the Olympic program at the Sydney Games in 2000 over the Olympic Distance (swim: \u00a0\u2013 bike: \u00a0\u2013 run: ). A mixed relay event was introduced, using four Super Sprint distance legs, in the Tokyo Games in 2021.\nParalympics.\nParatriathlon at the Summer Paralympics debuted at the 2016 Summer Paralympics held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Paratriathlon is a variant of the triathlon for athletes with a physical disability. The Paralympic event originally scheduled a sprint race with athletes competing in six categories according to the nature of their physical impairments.\nOther events.\nThousands of individual triathlons are held around the world each year. Some are local and quite small, others with hundreds of participants. Many give their participants completion medals, with additional awards for placement in their age or other category group. A few of these races are well known because they have a long history or because they have particularly grueling courses and race conditions.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Sister-inline/styles.css\"/&gt; Media related to at Wikimedia Commons"}
{"id": "31525", "revid": "1314428163", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31525", "title": "Germs (band)", "text": "American punk rock band\nThe Germs were an American punk rock band from Los Angeles, California, originally active from 1976 to 1980. The band's \"classic\" lineup consisted of singer Darby Crash, guitarist Pat Smear, bassist Lorna Doom and drummer Don Bolles. They released only one album, 1979's \"(GI)\", produced by Joan Jett, and were featured in Penelope Spheeris' seminal documentary film \"The Decline of Western Civilization\", which chronicled the Los Angeles punk movement. The Germs disbanded following Crash's suicide in 1980. Their music was influential to many later rock acts, and Smear went on to achieve greater fame performing with Nirvana and Foo Fighters.\nIn 2005, actor Shane West was cast to play Crash in the biographical film \"What We Do Is Secret\". He performed with Smear, Doom, and Bolles at the film's wrap party, and afterwards, the Germs reunited with West as their new frontman. This lineup of the band toured worldwide, which included performances at the 2006 and 2008 Warped Tours.\nHistory.\nFormation.\nCrash (born Jan Paul Beahm) and Smear (born Georg Ruthenberg) decided to start a band after being kicked out of University High School for antisocial behavior, allegedly for using \"mind control\" on fellow students. Their original name was \"Sophistifuck and the Revlon Spam Queens\", but they had to shorten the name as they could not afford that many letters on a T-shirt. The (initially hypothetical) first line-up consisted of Beahm (then known as Bobby Pyn, and later as Darby Crash) on vocals, Ruthenberg (under the name Pat Smear) on guitar, an early member named \"Dinky\" (Diana Grant) on bass, and Michelle Baer playing drums. This line-up never played in front of a live audience.\nIn April 1976, the band added Lorna Doom (born Teresa Ryan) on bass, with transitional member Dottie Danger (later famous as Belinda Carlisle of the Go-Go's) on drums. Carlisle never actually played with the band, as she was sidelined by a bout of mononucleosis for an extended period. She was replaced by her friend Donna Rhia (Becky Barton), who played three gigs and performed on their first single. Carlisle remained a friend and helper of the band (she can be heard introducing the band on the \"Germicide: Live at the Whiskey\" recording, produced by Kim Fowley), only leaving because her new band, the Go-Go's, were becoming popular and, as she put it, \"I was really disturbed by the heroin that was going on\". Nickey Beat, of various noteworthy Los Angeles bands including the Weirdos, also sat in on drums for a time.\nThe band's first live performance was at the Orpheum Theater, a 99-seat venue on the Sunset Strip in then-unincorporated area West Hollywood, California (later the location of Book Soup). Smear recalled: \"We made noise. Darby stuck the mic in a jar of peanut butter. It was a dare, we had no songs or anything! Lorna wore her pants inside out, and Darby covered himself in red licorice... we made noise for five minutes until they threw us off\".\nThe Germs initially drew musical influences from Iggy Pop, David Bowie, Ramones, the Runaways, Sex Pistols, and New York Dolls. Early on, Smear was the only musically experienced member; Doom survived early performances by sliding a finger up and down the fretboard of her bass while Rhia generally kept a minimal beat on the bass drum, periodically bashing a cymbal.\nEarly performances were usually marked by raucous crowds made up of the band's friends. As a result, their gigs became notorious for being rowdy and usually verged on a riot.\nRecordings.\nThe first single, \"Forming\", was recorded on a Sony two-track reel-to-reel recorder in Smear's family garage, and arrived back from the pressing plant with a note warning \"this record may cause ear cancer\" printed on the sleeve. much to the band's displeasure. It was released in July 1977 on the What? label. The single featured a shambolic but serviceable performance on the A-side and a muddy live recording of \"Sexboy\" on the B-side, recorded at the Roxy for the Cheech and Chong movie, \"Up in Smoke\". The song was not used in the movie, nor was the band. They were the only band not to receive a call-back to perform live for the film's \"Battle of the Bands\" sequence, perhaps due to the fact that the Germs' chaotic Roxy performance had featured an unscripted, full-on food fight.\nThroughout their career, they had a reputation as a chaotic live band. Crash often arrived onstage nearly incoherent from drugs, singing everywhere but into the microphone and taunting the audience between songs, yet nevertheless, delivered intense theatrical and increasingly musical performances. The other band members prided themselves on similar problems, with many contemporary reviews citing collapses, incoherence and drunken vomiting onstage. Fans saw this as part of the show, and indeed, the band presented it as such, even when breaking bottles and rolling in the glass, with the music coming and going.\nSmear was revealed to be a remarkably talented and fluid player; much later, after Crash's death, critics finally acknowledged his lyrics as poetic art. Crash's vocals had begun to mold themselves around the style of the Screamers' vocalist Tomata DuPlenty. Another strong influence on the band's final sound was Zolar X, a theatrical glam rock band popular in the Los Angeles area c. 1972\u20131980. Crash and Smear were enthusiastic fans of the band from the pre-Germs days, and the fast tempos and raw guitar tone of (the historically pre-punk) Zolar X were similar to the sound achieved on later Germs recordings.\nThe Germs recorded two singles (with alternate tracks), an album-length demo session, and one full-length LP, \"(GI)\", each more focused and powerful than the last. Crash was, despite his erratic behavior, generally regarded as a brilliant lyricist (a contemporary critic described him as \"ransacking the dictionary\"), and the final line-up of Smear, Doom and Bolles had become a world-class rock ensemble by the recording of \"(GI)\", turning in a performance that spurred an \"LA Weekly\" reviewer to write, \"This album leaves exit wounds\". It is considered one of the first hardcore punk records, and has a near-mythic status among punk rock fans. The album was produced by Joan Jett of the Runaways. Some European copies of the album also credited Donny Rose on keyboards (the song \"Shut Down\" was recorded live in the studio and featured melodic, two-fisted piano).\nThe Germs were featured in Spheeris's documentary film \"The Decline of Western Civilization\" along with X, Black Flag, Fear, Circle Jerks, Alice Bag Band, and Catholic Discipline.\nFollowing the release of their only studio album, \"(GI)\", on Slash Records, the Germs recorded six original songs with producer Jack Nitzsche for the soundtrack to the film, \"Cruising\", starring Al Pacino. Doom wrote one of the songs. Only one of these songs, \"Lions Share\", ended up on the Columbia soundtrack album. It was featured for approximately one minute in the movie, during a video-booth murder scene in an S&amp;M club. Other songs from this session did not appear until the 1988 bootleg \"Lion's Share\", along with four tracks from their infamous last show at the Starwood. The \"Cruising\" sessions were finally released officially on the CD \"(MIA): The Complete Anthology\".\nDissolution and suicide of Crash.\nThe end of the band came when Crash, who had become increasingly impatient with drummer Bolles' antics, fired him and replaced him with his friend and lover Rob Henley, a fellow heroin addict.\nShortly after the Germs split, Crash and Smear formed the short-lived Darby Crash Band. Circle Jerks drummer Lucky Lehrer joined the band on the eve of their first (sold-out) live performance when, during a soundcheck, Darby kicked out the drummer they had rehearsed with. The band, described by Smear as \"like the Germs, but with worse players\", played only a few gigs to lukewarm reaction before splitting up.\nShortly after that, Crash contacted Smear about a Germs \"reunion\" show, claiming it was necessary to \"put punk into perspective\" for the punks on the scene. However, Smear has said Crash told him privately he wanted to earn money for heroin with which to die by suicide. Since Crash had described this scenario many times in the past, Smear did not take him seriously.\nOn December 3, 1980, an over-sold Starwood hosted a final live show of the reunited Germs, including Bolles. At one point, Crash told the amazed kids in the audience, \"We did this show so you new people could see what it was like when we were around. You're not going to see it again\". Rhino Handmade officially released this live set, previously unavailable in its entirety, as \"Live at the Starwood Dec. 3, 1980\" on June 14, 2010. Along with the CD, the release includes an 8\u00bd\" \u00d7 11\" replica of the original poster for the show, a reproduction of the handwritten set list and a four-page fanzine with photos and liner notes by Jonathan Gold.\nCrash died by suicide on December 7, 1980, at age 22. Unreported at the time, Crash had overdosed on heroin in a suicide pact with close friend Casey \"Cola\" Hopkins, who ended up surviving. She later insisted that he did not intend for her to live, nor did he change his mind at the last minute and intend for himself to live. According to \"Spin\", apocryphal lore has Crash attempting to write \"Here lies Darby Crash\" on the wall as he lay dying, but not finishing. In reality, he wrote a short note to David \"Bosco\" Davenport that stated, \"My life, my leather, my love goes to Bosco\".\nOutside the world of the Germs' fans, news of Crash's death was largely overshadowed by the murder of John Lennon the next day. A local news station mistakenly reported that Crash had died from taking too many sleeping pills.\nAftermath.\nAfter the Germs ended, Bolles played with several other L.A. bands, including Nervous Gender, 45 Grave, Celebrity Skin, and Ariel Pink. In fall 2009, Bolles joined the cast of punks, mods and rockers web series \"Oblivion\".\nIn 1993, Slash released \"(MIA): The Complete Anthology\", with liner notes by Pleasant Gehman.\nSmear went on to play with Nirvana during their last year and, after the death of Kurt Cobain, with Mike Watt, and then Foo Fighters.\nIn 1996, a tribute album titled \"A Small Circle of Friends\" was released, that featured tracks by Watt, Free Kitten, Melvins, Meat Puppets, that dog., L7, the Posies, NOFX, Flea, Gumball and others, along with a version of \"Circle One\" performed by Smear with Hole under the name \"the Holez\".\n\"What We Do Is Secret\", reformations and Doom's death (2005\u2013present).\nA film about the Germs, \"What We Do Is Secret\", was in production for several years, and premiered June 23, 2007, at the Los Angeles Film Festival. The film was theatrically released on August 8, 2008, and starred Shane West in the role of Darby Crash.\nSmear, Doom, and Bolles reactivated the Germs with West as singer. They played on the 2006 Warped Tour and toured clubs in the US later that summer, and again in 2007. They once again played on the 2008 edition of the Warped Tour, on the Vans Old School Stage. Some members of the punk rock community such as Fat Mike and Jello Biafra were critical of the band's decision to perform with West.\nIn a July 2009 article, Bolles spoke about the band's plans to re-record old material for a planned box set titled \"Lest We Forget: The Sounds of the Germs\". The band rearranged songs from the \"Germicide\" live album and the \"Cruising\" sessions; they planned to record several Darby Crash Band songs as well. Live recordings, both old and new, would have made up the rest of the box set, which Bolles hoped to release in 2010. The newly recorded songs were to be released on Smashing Pumpkins frontman Billy Corgan's new, unnamed record label. Two songs, \"Out of Time\" and \"Beyond Hurt \u2013 Beyond Help\", were originally written by Crash and Smear prior to Crash's death, but were never recorded. The songs were to be recorded with West providing vocals. West left the Germs in 2009.\nIn December 2013, Charlotte Caffey of the Go-Go's played bass for a one-off gig, a memorial for Bill \"Pat Fear\" Bartell, when Doom could not be located.\nOn January 16, 2019, Doom died of breast cancer.\nMembers.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-begin/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

A member of Thuggee was referred to as a \"Thug\".\nThe Thugs were purported to have murdered their victims by strangling using a bandana as a tool. The Thugs were believed to practice their killings as a form of worship toward the goddess Kali. For centuries, the authorities of the Indian subcontinent, such as the Khalji dynasty, the Mughal Empire, and the British Raj, all attempted to curtail the criminal activities of Thuggee during their rule.\nContemporary scholarship is increasingly skeptical of the \"thuggee\" concept, and has questioned the existence of such a phenomenon, which has led many historians to describe \"thuggee\" as the invention of the British colonial regime. Jonathan Perris has argued that early stories about Thuggee had less to do with Indian social history than with the literary culture of London at the time.\nEtymology.\n (), translated from Hindi as 'swindler' or 'deceiver'. It is related with the verb ('to deceive'), from the Sanskrit ( 'cunning, sly, fraudulent') and (, 'he conceals'). This term, describing the murder and robbery of travellers, was popular in the northern parts of the Indian subcontinent, especially the northern and eastern regions of India. The English word \"thug\" is from the same roots.\nThe Janamsakhis used the term thag to refer to a robber who used to lure pilgrims. Jean de Th\u00e9venot in his 1665 account referred to a band of robbers who used a \"certain Slip with a running noose\" to strangle their victims. John Fryer also mentions a similar method of strangling used by robbers from Surat whom he saw being given capital punishment by the Mughals in 1675. He mentioned that three of them were relatives, which Kim A. Wagner notices is similar to the Thugs who were thought to have engaged in this as a family profession. A decree issued by Aurangzeb in 1672 refers to a similar method and uses the term \"Phansigar\".\nMethods of robbery and murder.\nThe garrote is often depicted as a weapon of the Thuggee. Other evidences suggest that the katar (dagger) was their personal status weapon, the Thuggee wore this weapon proudly across their chest. Early references to Thugs reported they committed their strangulation murders with nooses of rope or catgut, but later they adopted the use of a length of cloth that could be used as a sash or scarf, and thus more easily concealed. This cloth is sometimes described as a rum\u0101l (head covering or kerchief), translated as \"yellow scarf\"; \"yellow\", in this case, may refer to a natural cream or khaki colour rather than bright yellow.\nThe Thuggees preferred to use the method of strangulation to take advantage of loopholes in civil law which persisted from the times of the Mughal Empire, which ruled most of India from the 1500s. For a murderer to be sentenced to death, he or she must have shed the blood of their victim. Those who murdered but did not shed blood might face imprisonment, hard labor and paying a penalty\u2014but they would not risk execution.\nThe Thuggee reportedly operated as gangs of highwaymen who tricked and murdered their victims by strangling. To take advantage of their victims, the thugs would join travellers and gain their confidence, which would allow them to surprise and strangle the travellers with a handkerchief or noose. \nOne of the Thuggee would befriend their potential targets (even to the point of assuming their religion) and accompany them for a while to assess their potential wealth. Eventually, as one Thug managed to distract their victims by engaging them in conversation, the other members who were tasked with the killing would strangle them swiftly from behind. After the murder, they sometimes mutilated the corpses to hide evidence, and buried the remains. Their modus operandi led to the thugs being called \"Phansigar\" (\"using a noose\"), a term more commonly used in southern India. \nAlthough strangulation is one of their most-recognised methods of murder, they also used blades and poison. The Thuggee gangs usually commenced their act in the evening, and attacked travelling groups whose numbers were smaller than their own groups to avoid unnecessary losses. To avoid suspicion, they carried only a few swords. The poisonous ingredients which were prepared by the Thuggee consisted of \"Datura metel\", the Indian thornapple (family Solanaceae). A poisonous plant with powerful deliriant properties and sacred to Shiva, it was sometimes used by thugs to induce drowsiness or stupefaction, making strangulation easier. The Hindi name for the plant \"\u0927\u0924\u0942\u0930\u093e\" (\"dhat\u016bra\") is derived from Sanskrit and was adapted by Linnaeus into the Latinate genus name \"Datura\".\nA leader of a Thuggee was called \"jemadar\". This was derived from military-style ranks such as jemadar and \"subedar\" among Thugs as well as reference to individual members as a \"private\", suggests that the organisation of their gangs had a military link. They used a jargon known as \"Ramasee\" to disguise their true intentions from their targets. The Thuggee members comprised some who had inherited Thuggee as a family vocation, and others who were forced to turn to it out of necessity. The leadership of many of the groups tended to be hereditary with family members sometimes serving together in the same band. Such thugs were known as \"aseel\". According to a Thuggee testimony, a young initiate who joined the group was usually trained by a senior experienced Thuggee member who held the title of \"guru\". While they usually kept their acts a secret, female thugs also existed and were called \"baronee\" in Ramasee, while an important male Thuggee was called \"baroo\".\nThe Thuggee usually avoided killing the children of the victims and instead adopted them. However, sometimes they resorted to killing women and children to eliminate witnesses. Some of the thugs avoided murdering victims they considered proscribed according to their beliefs and let other unscrupulous members commit the murder or were forced to let them by those who did not believe in their customs like the Muslim thugs. Many of them avoided committing the robberies near the areas in which they lived, to avoid recognition and criminal repercussion.\nHistory.\nChinese monk and traveller Hiuen Tsang (Xuanzang) who visited India during 7th AD recorded his experience how he narrowly escapes from the threat of Thuggee gang during His journey.\nHowever, the earliest known reference to the Thuggees as a band or fraternity, rather than ordinary thieves, was found from the 9th AD text titled \"Bhasarvajna\", where the words of \"samasaramocaka\" and \"thakasastra\" were used in connection with ritual murder and the sacred texts of the Thuggee, respectively.\nA 12th century Jainism text \"Upadesamala\" tells about allegorical story about the sacking of \"Avanitala\" city by a horde of thieves who intensively \"practiced in thagavidya\".\nHistorian Kim A. Wagner suggested that the Thuggee was possibly appeared as early as 1300s Century. Ziau-d din Barni's \"History of Firoz Shah\" (written about 1356) also recorded the existence of Thuggee as religious fraternity. He narrated an incident of the sultan Jalal-ud-din Khalji having arrested 1,000 Thugs, and expelling them to the Lakhnauti. At first, Jalal-ud-din took a lenient attitude towards the Thuggees as he thought he could make them obedient with a softer approach. However, this approach proved counter productive according to modern historian Syama Prasad Basu, and encouraged insolence towards the Sultan.\nIn the 16th century Surdas, in his allegorical couplet, mentioned robbers called \"thags\" who would lure victims into their clutches to kill them and steal their property. Ibn Battuta, on his way to Calicut from Delhi as an envoy to China, was attacked by bandits, who were suspected as the Thuggee gang.\nOne of the earliest European record about Thuggee activity came from Nicholas Withington, an English traveller who travelled to India during 1612-14 during the rule of emperor Jahangir. Withington witnessed first-hand the action of Thuggee, as Withington's group was once encountered a thuggee, who robs their belongings and weapons.\nOn 16 June 1672, Mughal emperor Aurangzeb issued a firman law to the diwan court of Gujarat, which addressing several problems which includes the Thuggee activities. The specifically issue about Thuggery practice of murder-by-strangle was listed specifically on the 10th point:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;10. A strangler whose act of strangulation has been legally proved should be chastised and confined till he repents. But if he is habituated to the work and the fact is proved, \u2026 then execute him.\nOther than that, there were numerous traditions about their origin: \nThe \"River Thugs\" preyed upon people including Hindu pilgrims travelling using the Ganga river and became mostly active during the winter like their compatriots from Murnae, Bundelkhand and Awadh. Their dialect of Ramasee differed from the one used by their compatriots on land and used boats taken on lease from their builders or from a jemadar called Khuruck Baboo. Sleeman states that they tapped three times to give the signal to murder which they always committed during the day. To avoid detection of a corpse, they broke its back and threw it in the river to be eaten by crocodiles and only robbed money or jewels.\nBritish suppression.\nThe British found out about them in Southern India for the first time in 1807, while in Northern India they were discovered in 1809 with an effort to suppress them being carried out from 1809 to 1812.\nAfter a dispute developed between the Zamindar official named Tejun with a Thuggee named Ghasee Ram in 1812, the latter took refuge with his family under another landlord called Laljee. Tejun in turn revealed the thugs of Sindouse to Nathaniel Halhed. Thomas Perry, the magistrate of Etawah, assembled some soldiers of the East India Company under the command of Halheld in 1812 to suppress the Thugs. Laljee and his forces including over 100 Thugs were defeated, with the village of Murnae, a headquarter of the Thugs, destroyed and burnt by the Company soldiers. Laljee fled to Rampura and the southern banks of Sindh River but was caught by the Marathas who turned him over to the company.\nBritish authorities had occasionally captured and prosecuted Thugs, circulating information about these cases in newsletters or the journal \"Asiatick Researches\" of The Asiatic Society. However, Sleeman seems to have been the first to realize that information obtained from one group of stranglers might be used to track and identify other thugs in a different district. His first major breakthrough was the capture of \"Feringhea\" (also known as Syeed Amir Ali, Khuda Buksh, Deahuct Undun and Daviga Persaud), who was persuaded to turn King's evidence. (Feringhea's story was the basis of the successful 1839 novel \"Confessions of a Thug\"). Feringhea brought Sleeman to a mass grave with a hundred bodies, told him the circumstances of the murders and named the Thugs who had committed them.\nAfter initial investigations confirmed what Feringhea had said, Sleeman began an extensive campaign using profiling and intelligence. Sleeman was made superintendent of the Thuggee and Dacoity Department in 1835, an organ of the Indian government first established by the East India Company in 1830. (Dacoity referred to organised banditry, distinguished from thugs most notably by its open practice and due to the fact that murder was not an intrinsic element of their \"modus operandi\".) Sleeman developed elaborate intelligence techniques that pre-dated similar methods in Europe and the US by decades. During the 1830s, the thugs were targeted for eradication by the Governor-General of India, Lord William Bentinck, and his chief captain, William Henry Sleeman.\nRecords were made in which the accused were given prisoner numbers, against which their names, residences, fellow thugs, and the criminal acts for which they were blamed were also noted. Many thugs' names were similar; they often lacked surnames since the Thuggee naming convention was to use the names of their tribes, castes and job assignments in the gangs. Accurate recording was also difficult because the thugs adopted many aliases, with both Muslim and Hindu thugs often posing as members of the other religion. By the testimony from a Thuggee named Ghulam Hussain, Hindu and Muslim Thuggees avoided eating together, such was not the case for drinking and smoking.\nThe campaign relied heavily on captured thugs who became informants. These informants were offered protection on the condition that they told everything that they knew. According to historian Mike Dash, who used documents in the UK archives, suspects were subject to bench trials before British judges. Though the trials were lacking by later standards (e.g., suspects were not allowed legal representation), they were conducted with care to protocols of the time. While most suspects were convicted, Dash notes that the courts genuinely seemed interested in finding the truth and rejected a minority of allegations due to mistaken identity or insufficient evidence. Even by later standards, Dash argues, the evidence of guilt for many thugs was often overwhelming. Because they used boats and disposed of their victims in rivers, the \"River Thugs\" were able to evade the British authorities for some time after their compatriots on land were suppressed. They were ultimately betrayed to the authorities by one of their compatriots, from Awadh. Forces under Sleeman's command hunted them down in 1836.\nIn 1870s the practice of thuggee was thought to have ceased. However, the history of Thuggee led to the Criminal Tribes Act (CTA) of 1871. Although the CTA was repealed at Indian independence in 1947, tribes considered criminal still exist in India. The Thuggee and Dacoity Department remained in existence until 1904, when it was replaced by the Central Criminal Intelligence Department (CID).\nIn \"Following the Equator\", Mark Twain wrote about an 1839 government report by William Henry Sleeman:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Chapter xlvi, conclusion\nThug beliefs.\nAccording to 9th century text \"Bhadarvajna\", Some Jainism texts also provide reference to \"Thugvidya\" as \u201ca magic spell or ritual performed by Thugs before preceding their criminal activities.\u201d. The text content was about religious instruction to perform \"Thag\". Another Thuggee reference from Jainism scriptures came from 16th century sanskrit written Text \"Sarvajiasataka\" (One Hundred Verses on the Omniscient)\nAccording to modern historian Susan M. Griffith, the British accounts reported that Thuggee was a Hindu cult, dedicated to Kali (or Bowanee/Bohwanie), goddess of destruction. The Thugs considered themselves to be the children of Kali, having been created from her sweat.\nAccording to colonial sources, Thugs believed that they played a positive role in saving human lives. Without the Thugs' sacred service, Kali might destroy all mankind:\nThe Muslim thugs, while retaining their monotheistic faith, had functionalised Bhavani for Thuggee and she was syncretised as a spirit subordinate to Allah. A Muslim thug caught by Sleeman stated, \"In my heart, I take the name of God, when I strangle a man \u2013 saying \"God thou are King!\" \"Alla, toomee Malik!\" I do not pray to Bhowanee, but I worship her.\" Other Muslim Thugs who had agreed to testify for Sleeman, stated they had assimilated Bhavani and started the practice of Thuggee.\nIn the view of the historian Mike Dash, the Thuggee had no religious motivation in their murderous conduct. When religious elements were present among Thugs, their beliefs, in principle, were little different from the religious beliefs of many others who lived on the Indian subcontinent and attributed their success or failure to supernatural powers: \"Indeed all of the Thugs's legends which concerned the goddess Kali featured exactly the cautionary notes which are typically found in folklore.\"\nKim Wagner asserts that we can analyse their traditions about events after their flight from Delhi \"to a much greater advantage\". A tradition which was recounted by a captive stated that Thuggee had originally tried to settle in Agra and they later settled in Akoopore in the Doab region. However, they had to flee to Himmutpur and later they fled to Parihara after their kings started demanding a larger share of the plunder. In turn the original Muslim and Kayastha Thugs helped spread Thuggee amongst other groups like the Brahmins, Rajputs, other Hindus, the Lodhi people and the Ahir people.\nThe Thuggee generally considered that it was forbidden to kill women, \"fakirs\", ascetics, bards, musicians and dancers. Like the ancient Hindu texts which distinguished robbery from the murder of Brahmins, women or children as violent crimes, many Thugs considered it taboo to kill people who belonged to such categories. Those who worked in lowly professions, the diseased and disabled were also forbidden as victims based on their folk belief. The Thuggee cults believed that breaking these rules would incur divine retribution.\nGroups.\nThe East India Company officers since the time of Thomas Perry, who was appointed to Etawah in 1811, came to understand that there were many Thuggee groups and they all viewed themselves to be different from the other groups.\nThe Thuggee groups were often formed based on their native hometown, although some were also formed based on their professions. The group called \"Jamuldahee\" was named so because its members lived along the Yamuna river, they hailed from the Doab and Awadh regions. Another stated origin is that their ancestor was the Thuggee Jumulud Deen. The Telinganie originated from Telangana, Arcottees from Arcot and Beraries from Berar. The \"Lodaha\" group, mostly concentrated in Bihar, were caravaneers named after the \"lodha\" or load they carried and according to a Thuggee from the Doab, originated from the same ancestors of his clan. The Lodahas were prevalent in the region around Nepal in Bihar and Bengal during the tenure of Perry and originally hailed from Awadh which they left around 1700. A Deccan Thuggee stated that the \"Hindu Thugs of Talghat\", located around the Krishna River, didn't marry with the Telinganies whom they considered to be descendants of lower classes as a result of their professions. The \"Telinganie\" group were also disparagingly called \"Handeewuls\" (from \"handi\") due to their eating habits.\nThe Pungoo or Bungoo of Bengal derived their name from the region, with the Lodhees or Lodaha also present. The Motheea group of Rampur-Purnia region was from a caste of weavers and their name derived from the practice of giving \"handful\" (\"muhti\") of the spoils to the head. In the modern-day Uttar Pradesh, the groups were: the \"Korkureeas\" from Kohrur, \"Agureeas\" of Agra, \"Jumaldahees\", \"Lodhees\" and \"Tundals\". The \"Multaneea\" were from Multan. In Madhya Pradesh, the groups were: \"Bangureeas\" or \"Banjaras\", \"Balheems\" or \"Bulheems\", \"Khokhureeas\" and \"Soopurreeas\" of Sheopur. In modern Rajasthan, the groups were \"Guguras\" whose name derives from river Ghaggar, and the \"Sooseeas\" who were part of the Dhanuk clan. The \"Dhoulanee\" group existed in modern-day Maharashtra. The \"Duckunies\" of Deccan were from Munirabad and \"Kurnaketies\" from the Carnatic region. Another group was called \"Kathurs\" whose name derives from a bowl called \"kathota\", based on a tradition of a man who held it during celebrations by Thugs. The \"Qulundera\" group's name was derived from the Muslim saints called \"qalandar\". There were also Jogi thugs who were divided into twelve sub-groups.\nAccording to Feringheea, the Brahmins of Tehngoor village of Parihar were taught Thuggee after they accompanied the kings of Meos to Delhi, and later helped in spreading it in the region around Murnae. He also stated that two of his ancestors had settled and intermarried with Brahmins of Murnae about seven generations ago, which led to the introduction of Thuggee in the area. A thug hailing from Shikohabad whilst talking of his clan's origin, recounted to Perry a tradition that the Munhars were influenced to take up Thuggee after witnessing the immense plunder acquired by Afghans, Mewatties and the Sheikhs.\nSleeman in 1839 identified a band called \"Meypunnaists\" who he stated abducted children to sell them further. Another band called \"Tashmabazes\" who used methods introduced by a soldier named Creagh who was deployed at Cawnpore in 1802 were also identified by him. The group called \"River Thugs\" were based deep in the Hooghly region.\nHistorical evaluations.\nWorship of Kali was particularly emphasized by the British contemporaries. McLeod commented, \"It is a notable fact that not only amongst the Thugs, but in an especial manner among all lawless fraternities, and to a certain extent throughout the uneducated population of Central India, the Mussulmans vie with the Hindus in a devotion of this sanguinary deity (\"Devi\" or \"Bhavani\") far exceeding that they pay to any other.\" Sleeman thought that some Brahmins acted as intelligence providers to thugs, claiming that they profited from Thuggee and directed it. David Ochterlony blamed the Pindaris for the rise of Thuggee while Sleeman blamed it on Indian rulers dismissing their armies which took away the jobs of many soldiers. Based on Sleeman's writings about the Thugs, Robert Vane Russell claimed that most of them were Kanjars. He viewed the Muslim Kanjars as having recently converted to Islam.\nThe British generally took the view that Thuggee was a type of ritual murder practiced by worshippers of Kali. Sleeman's view of it as an aberrant faith was based on the contemporary British view that Hinduism was a despicable and immoral faith founded on idol-worship. R. C. Sherwood in \"Asiatick Researches\" published in 1820 traces this phenomenon back to the Muslim conquests of India and suggests links to Hindu mythology. Charles Trevelyan viewed Thugs as representatives of the \"essence\" of Hinduism (rather than as a deviant sect), which he considered to be \"evil\" and \"false\".\nIn 1882, Alexander Cunningham commented on Hiouen-Thsang's remarks about \"people who visited Kahalgaon and forgot to leave it\", speculating that the actual reason might not have been that posited by the monk and noting Kahalgaon's later reputation as a place frequented by the \"River Thugs\".\nModern scepticism.\nModern contemporary scholars have become increasingly sceptical of the \"thuggee\" concept, and have even questioned the existence of such a phenomenon. The British representation of Thuggee is held by some critics to be full of inconsistencies and exaggerations. Numerous historians have described \"thuggee\" as basically the invention of the British colonial regime. However, the more radical critics in this camp have themselves been criticized for focusing overly on British perceptions of thuggee rather than on the historical accuracy of primary source documents, but conclude that \"the colonial representation of thuggee cannot be taken at face value\".\nMartine van Woerkens of \u00c9cole Pratique des Hautes \u00c9tudes writes that evidence for a Thuggee group in the 19th century was the product of \"colonial imaginings\", arising from British fear of the little-known interior of India, as well as limited understanding of the religious and social practices of its inhabitants.\nCynthia Ann Humes states that the testimony of most of the thugs captured by Sleeman does not support his view of priests profiting from and directing the thugs. She adds that the Islamic idea of fate was more commonly invoked during Thuggee acts, while invoking the Hindu Bhavani was far more rare.\nHistorian Kim Wagner views the policies of East India Company in relation to the dismissal of armies of the conquered Indian kingdoms as being responsible for the development of Thuggee. Roaming bands of freelance soldiers had often joined one kingdom or another during the pre-British era, with the main income of many armies coming from plunder. After being dismissed from military service, they turned to robbery as a means of subsistence. He also contested whether the thugs mentioned by Firuz Shah Tughlaq's biography were actually the same thugs the British authorities fought against.\nSagnik Bhattacharya agrees with the sceptics and claims the thug-phenomenon to be nothing but a manifestation of the fear of the unknown that dawned on the British Raj at the thought of being alone in the wilderness of Central India. Using literary and legal sources, he has connected the \"information panic\" of the thug-phenomenon to the limitations of British demographic models that fell short of truly capturing the ethnic diversity of India. He explains the \"Thuggee hysteria\" around 1830s as being caused by the Raj's angst at realizing its own ignorance of local society.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The treaty was signed at the Campo de Cahuenga on 13 January 1847, ending the fighting of the Mexican\u2013American War within Alta California (modern-day California). The treaty was drafted in both English and Spanish by Jos\u00e9 Antonio Carrillo and signed by John C. Fr\u00e9mont, representing the American forces, and Andr\u00e9s Pico, representing the Mexican forces.\nThe treaty called for the Californios to give up their artillery, and provided that all prisoners from both sides be immediately freed. Those Californios who promised not to again take up arms during the war, and to obey the laws and regulations of the United States, were allowed to peaceably return to their homes and ranchos. They were to be allowed the same rights and privileges as were allowed to citizens of the United States, and were not to be compelled to take an oath of allegiance until a treaty of peace was signed between the United States and Mexico, and were given the privilege of leaving the country if they wished to do so.\nUnder the later Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo in 1848, Mexico formally ceded Alta California and other territories to the United States, and the disputed border of Texas was fixed at the Rio Grande. Pico, like nearly all the Californios, became an American citizen with full legal and voting rights. Pico later became a State Assemblyman and then a State Senator representing Los Angeles in the California State Legislature.\nBackground.\nOn December 27, 1846, Fr\u00e9mont and the California Battalion, in their march south to Los Angeles, reached a deserted Santa Barbara and raised the American flag. He occupied a hotel close to the adobe of Bernarda Ruiz de Rodriguez, a wealthy educated woman of influence and Santa Barbara town matriarch, who had four sons on the Mexican side. She asked for and was granted ten minutes of Fr\u00e9mont's time, which stretched to two hours; she advised him that a generous peace would be to his political advantage\u2014one that included Pico's pardon, release of prisoners, equal rights for all Californians and respect of property rights.\nFr\u00e9mont later wrote, \"I found that her object was to use her influence to put an end to the war, and to do so upon such just and friendly terms of compromise as would make the peace acceptable and enduring. ... She wished me to take into my mind this plan of settlement, to which she would influence her people; meantime, she urged me to hold my hand, so far as possible. ... I assured her I would bear her wishes in mind when the occasion came.\"\nOn January 8, 1847, Fr\u00e9mont arrived at San Fernando. On January 10, the combined army of Commodore Robert F. Stockton and Brigadier Stephen W. Kearny re-took Los Angeles following the Battle of the San Gabriel River and the Battle of La Mesa. Fr\u00e9mont learned of the reoccupation the next day. Fr\u00e9mont and two of Pico's officers agreed to the terms for a surrender, and Articles of Capitulation were penned by Jose Antonio Carrillo in both English and Spanish. The first seven articles in the treaty were nearly the verbatim suggestions offered by Bernarda Ruiz de Rodriguez.\nOn January 13, at a rancho at the north end of Cahuenga Pass, John Fr\u00e9mont, Andr\u00e9s Pico and six others signed the Articles of Capitulation, which became known as the Treaty of Cahuenga. The treaty, signed by the Mexican military commander of the area and a U.S. army colonel, was made without the formal backing of either the American government in Washington or the Mexican government in Mexico City, and even the ranking U.S. officers in the area (General Kearny and Commodore Stockton) were unaware of it. Still, it was eventually honored by both national governments and was immediately and permanently observed by the local American and Californio populations. Fighting ceased, thus ending the war in California.\nOn January 14, the California Battalion entered Los Angeles in a rainstorm, and Fr\u00e9mont delivered the treaty to Commodore Robert Stockton. Kearny and Stockton decided to accept the liberal terms offered by Fr\u00e9mont to terminate hostilities although Andr\u00e9s Pico had broken his earlier pledge that he would not fight U.S. forces. The next day, Stockton approved the Treaty of Cahuenga in a message that he sent to the Secretary of the Navy.\nHistorical re-enactment.\nIn celebration, on or around the date of the original signing, a historical ceremony is conducted at Campo de Cahuenga State Historic Park and site. From time to time, some of the descendants have appeared, along with actors to re-create this historical moment.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "31529", "revid": "141808", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31529", "title": "The Fall (band)", "text": "English rock band (1976\u20132018)\nThe Fall were an English post-punk band, formed in 1976 in Prestwich, Greater Manchester. They had many line-up changes, with vocalist and founder Mark E. Smith being the only constant member. The Fall's long-term musicians included drummers Paul Hanley, Simon Wolstencroft and Karl Burns; guitarists Craig Scanlon, Marc Riley, and Brix Smith; and bassist Steve Hanley, whose melodic, circular bass lines are widely credited with shaping the band's sound from early 1980s albums such as \"Hex Enduction Hour\" to the late 1990s. \nOriginally emerging out of the late 1970s punk movement, the Fall's music underwent numerous stylistic changes often concurrently with changes in the group's lineup. Their music was generally characterised by an abrasive, repetitive guitar-driven sound, tense bass and drum rhythms, and Smith's caustic lyrics. Although never achieving widespread mainstream success beyond minor hit singles in the late 1980s and early 1990s, they maintained a strong cult following throughout the years.\nThe Fall have been called \"the most prolific band of the British post-punk movement\". From 1979 to 2017, they released 31 studio albums, plus dozens of live albums and compilations released against Smith's wishes. The band have also been referred to as \"the Mighty Fall,\" a name originally given by British DJ John Peel, who regarded the band as his personal favorite and invited them numerous times on the BBC's Peel Sessions, stating: \"They are always different; they are always the same.\" The group disbanded after Smith's death in 2018.\nHistory.\nLate 1970s: early years.\nThe Fall were formed in Prestwich, England in 1976 by Mark E. Smith, Martin Bramah, Una Baines, and Tony Friel. The four friends met to read their writings to each other and take drugs. Their musical influences included Can (which the band would later pay tribute to on the track \"I Am Damo Suzuki\"), the Velvet Underground, Captain Beefheart and garage rock bands like the Monks and the Stooges. The members were devoted readers, with Smith citing H. P. Lovecraft, Raymond Chandler and Malcolm Lowry among his favourite writers. After seeing the Sex Pistols play their second gig at Manchester's Lesser Free Trade Hall in July 1976, they decided to start a group. Smith wanted to name the group \"the Outsiders\", but Friel came up with the name \"the Fall\" after a 1956 novel by Albert Camus. Smith became the singer, Bramah the guitarist, Friel played bass guitar and Baines bashed biscuit tins instead of drums; unable to afford to buy a drum kit, she then switched to keyboards. Their music was intentionally raw and repetitive. The song \"Repetition\", declaring that \"We dig repetition in the music And we're never going to lose it\", served as a manifesto for the Fall's musical philosophy.\nThe group played their first concert on 23 May 1977, at the North West Arts basement. Their first drummer was remembered only as \"Dave\" or \"Steve\" for 34 years, until music writer Dave Simpson discovered that he had almost certainly been a man named Steve Ormrod. Ormrod lasted just one show, at least in part due to political differences with the other members of the group. He was replaced by Karl Burns, whom Friel played with in a band called Nuclear Angel. The Fall soon caught the attention of Buzzcocks manager Richard Boon, who funded their first recording session, and in November 1977 they recorded material for their debut EP, \"Bingo-Master's Break-Out!\" Boon planned to release the EP on his New Hormones label, but after discovering that he could not afford to do so he gave the tapes back to the group. Thus, the Fall's debut on vinyl came in June 1978 when \"Stepping Out\" and \"Last Orders\" were released by Virgin Records on \"\", a compilation of live recordings made at the Manchester venue The Electric Circus in October 1977 just before it was closed.\nThe Fall's line-up had its first drastic changes in 1977\u201378. Kay Carroll, Una Baines's friend and colleague at the psychiatric hospital, became the group's manager and occasional backing vocalist, as well as Smith's girlfriend. Friel, unhappy with Carroll's management, left in December 1977 (he went on to form the Passage with Dick Witts). He was briefly replaced by Jonnie Brown, and later by Eric McGann (also known as Eric the Ferrett). The Fall were filmed on 13 February 1978 for the Granada TV show \"What's On\", hosted by Tony Wilson, performing \"Psycho Mafia\", \"Industrial Estate\" and \"Dresden Dolls\", featuring the brief line-up of Smith, Bramah, Burns, Baines and McGann. Baines left in March 1978 after a drug overdose and subsequent nervous breakdown, and was replaced by Yvonne Pawlett; McGann quit that May, in disgust at the group's van driver Steve Davies wearing a Hawaiian shirt as he ferried them to the recording of their first-ever session for influential radio DJ John Peel. (The Fall would record a total of 24 sessions for Peel, who became a devoted fan of the group.) Martin Bramah blamed the dissolution of the original line-up on Smith's style of leadership, together with Carroll's favouring of her partner: \"The break-up wasn't so much about the music, though; it was more how we were being treated as people on a daily basis.\" Marc Riley, the group's roadie was 16; eventually he was recruited to be in the group and play bass guitar.\n\"Bingo-Master's Break-Out!\" finally was released in August 1978 on Step Forward Records. The single \"It's the New Thing\" followed in November 1978, and in December the Fall recorded (in a single day) their debut album \"Live at the Witch Trials\", which was released in March 1979. Burns quit the group shortly after the album was recorded, and was replaced by Mike Leigh from Rockin' Ricky, a cabaret band. In April 1979, Burns was followed by Martin Bramah, co-writer of most of the songs on \"Live at the Witch Trials\" and, according to writer Daryl Eslea, \"possibly the last true equal to Smith in the group\"; he went on to form Blue Orchids with Una Baines. Marc Riley switched from bass guitar to guitar, and Craig Scanlon (guitar) and Steve Hanley (bass guitar), former bandmates of Riley and members of Fall support act Staff 9, joined the group. Hanley's melodic basslines became a vital part of the Fall's music for almost two decades. Smith praised his playing in \"Melody Maker\": \"The most original aspect of the Fall is Steve\u00a0... I've never heard a bass player like him\u00a0... I don't have to tell him what to play, he just knows. He is the Fall sound.\" Yvonne Pawlett left in July 1979 to look after her dog. She later appeared in a band called Shy Tots.\nOn 30 July 1979, \"Rowche Rumble\", the Fall's third single, was released featuring the line up of Smith, Scanlon, Riley, Hanley, Pawlett and Leigh. Pawlett left the group shortly afterwards. \"Dragnet\", the Fall's second album, was recorded in August 1979 at Cargo Studios, Rochdale, and was released on 26 October 1979. \"Dragnet\" signalled a sparser, more jagged feel in the Fall's music compared to \"Live at the Witch Trials\". The studio allegedly complained about the sound quality and protested against putting its name on the album sleeve, fearing it would put other artists off using the facilities.\n1980\u20131982: Classic line-up.\nThe Fall released their fourth single \"Fiery Jack\", their last for Step Forward, on 13 January 1980. In March, Mike Leigh left the group and went back to the cabaret circuit. According to Leigh, the band would have to wait for weeks without work while Smith came up with new lyrics, as opposed to regular weekly gigs in cabaret. Leigh's replacement was Paul Hanley, Steve Hanley's younger brother. He first played live with the Fall on Friday 21 March at Electric Ballroom, London\u2013he was only 16 and was actually still at school. Meanwhile, the Fall quit Step Forward and signed with Rough Trade; the first release on a new label became \"Totale's Turns\" in May 1980. This, with the exception of two tracks, was a live album documenting the band during various appearances in 1979, with Smith announcing last orders at the bar [responding to a request for the song \"Last Orders\"] and berating band members and audience throughout.\nIn November 1980, the Fall released their third full-length album \"Grotesque (After the Gramme)\". Preceded by a couple of acclaimed singles \"How I Wrote 'Elastic Man'\" and \"Totally Wired\", the album went to no. 1 on the UK Indie Chart. It was co-produced by Rough Trade's Geoff Travis and Mayo Thompson of Red Krayola and showed a significant improvement in production, which was to continue throughout the period. Smith, however, was unhappy with Rough Trade's politics, which showed when \"Slates\" came out in April 1981. Intentionally made too long for a single and too short to be considered an album, it was released as a 10\" EP for a price of just 2 pounds. The Fall eventually quit Rough Trade by the end of the year, and instead signed with a small indie label Kamera.\nAs the Fall were going to tour America after the release of \"Slates\", Paul Hanley was denied a visa as he was too young to play American clubs that serve alcohol, which restrict entry to those age 21 or older. Smith thus invited Karl Burns back into the group, initially as a temporary replacement. Select recordings from this tour were released in 1982 as \"A Part of America Therein, 1981\". After their return to the UK, Burns stayed in the group as a second drummer alongside Hanley. The first record to feature both Burns and Hanley became the \"Lie Dream of a Casino Soul\" single, produced by Richard Mazda and released in Australia and New Zealand in November 1981.\nOn 8 March 1982 \"Hex Enduction Hour\", also produced by Mazda, was released on Kamera Records, the Fall's seventh single (\"Look, Know\") was released 19 April 1982 on Kamera. On 27 September the \"Room to Live\" album was released on Kamera. Marc Riley was sacked at the end of the year, following several arguments, one of which resulted in a fist fight during the Australian tour. In response, Riley's band \"The Creepers\" wrote the track \"Jumper Clown\", which directly references Riley's dismissal, while also satirising Smith's dress sense.\nThis era is often regarded as a high point in the band's creative history, as noted by Ned Raggett of AllMusic who retrospectively described the late years with Riley and shortly after his departure as \"three years during which the band couldn't seem to make a wrong step.\"\n1983\u20131989: Brix Smith years.\nIn 1983, Rough Trade Records released the Fall's ninth single, \"The Man Whose Head Expanded\", and on 19 September issued the band's tenth single and double pack \"Kicker Conspiracy\". Bizarrely, in November Kamera Records released around two- to three-thousand copies of the planned 1982 single \"Marquis Cha Cha\", the release date having been put back due to Kamera's financial troubles in late 1982, making it the Fall's eleventh single issue.\nThat year Smith's American girlfriend and later wife, Brix Smith joined the band on guitar. Born Laura Elise Salenger, she was nicknamed after the track \"The Guns of Brixton\" by the Clash, a favourite song of hers. Brix's tenure in the group marked a shift towards the relatively conventional, with the songs she co-wrote often having strong pop hooks and more orthodox verse-chorus-verse structures. Additionally, Brix's keen sense of fashion gradually influenced the group's members to give more attention to their clothing and styling, though her platinum blonde hair and glamorous style were somewhat at odds to the otherwise working class appearance of the Fall. Brix's first live appearance with the Fall was on 21 September 1983 at the Hellfire Club, Wakefield.\n\"Perverted by Language\", released 5 December, was the Fall's final album for Rough Trade Records, but the first to feature Brix. Also released in December was the live album \"In a Hole\", recorded during the Fall's tour of New Zealand in 1982, on Flying Nun Records.\nThis era, a favourite period amongst many critics and fans, was marked by Brix's effort to find a wider audience for the Fall. They achieved a few modest UK hits with singles, including their versions of R. Dean Taylor's \"There's a Ghost in My House\" (no. 30, 1987) and the Kinks' \"Victoria\" (no. 35, 1988) and their own songs \"Hey! Luciani\" (no. 59, 1986) and \"Hit the North\" (no. 57, 1987), and enjoyed a string of critically acclaimed albums: \"The Wonderful and Frightening World of the Fall\" (1984), \"This Nation's Saving Grace\" (1985), \"Bend Sinister\" (1986), and \"The Frenz Experiment\" (1988). \"I Am Kurious, Oranj\" is notable as the fruit of a ballet project between Smith and dancer Michael Clark. Simon Rogers and later Marcia Schofield played keyboards. Paul Hanley quit during the tour supporting \"The Wonderful and Frightening World of the Fall\", and Simon Wolstencroft replaced other drummer Burns after \"This Nation's Saving Grace\". Wolstencroft becoming sole drummer shifted the group's sound; his drumming was described as \"nimble\" and \"funky\" when compared to Burns. In 2014 Wolstencroft published a memoir \"You Can Drum But You Can't Hide\" about his 11-year stint in the Fall.\n1990\u20132000.\nWith Brix's departure in 1989 \u2013 both from the band and her marriage to Smith \u2013 Bramah returned briefly for 1990's \"Extricate\", the first of the Fall's three albums for Phonogram Records. In the early 1990s the band continued to have modest success on the UK chart with singles including \"Telephone Thing\" (no. 58, 1990), \"White Lightning\" (no. 56, 1990), \"Free Range\" (no. 40, 1992) and \"Why Are People Grudgeful\" (no. 43, 1993). Bramah and Schofield were sacked in advance of 1991's \"Shift-Work\". Dave Bush joined on keyboards for 1992's \"\", followed by the band's return to an independent record label for \"The Infotainment Scan\" (1993), \"Middle Class Revolt\" (1994), and \"Cerebral Caustic\" (1995). These albums featured varying degrees of electronica and IDM, courtesy of Bush's keyboards and computers. \"Caustic\" saw the unexpected return of Smith's ex-wife Brix, who recorded \"The Light User Syndrome\" before departing in 1996. When Dave Bush went to join Elastica, Scanlon was sacked after sixteen years, an unpopular decision which Smith would later regret. In November 1994 Julia Nagle joined to help promote the release of \"Cerebral Caustic\", playing keyboards, guitars and computers. Nagle went onto contribute to \"The Light User Syndrome\" in 1996. That year also saw the start of a torrent of compilations of live, demo and alternative versions of songs on the Fall's new label Receiver Records.\nIn 1994 and 1996, the Fall played at the Phoenix Festival in Stratford-upon-Avon, England\u2013the 1996 appearance being one of much surprise to many fans as they were not scheduled to play. The next album, \"Levitate\" (1997), toyed with drum and bass and polarised opinion (long-serving drummer Simon Wolstencroft left halfway through the recording sessions, and was replaced\u2013again\u2013by Karl Burns). Steven Wells in the \"NME\" (11 October 1997) wrote, \"Imagine pop without perimeters. Imagine rock without rules. Imagine art without the wank. If you've never heard the Fall then \"Levitate\" will be either the best or the worst record you've ever heard.\" The group was temporarily reduced to Smith and Nagle when a short US tour ended in April 1998 with onstage rows in New York, which resulted in Smith unplugging the amps during songs and lashing out at the other members, leading Burns to physically shove him. This led to the departure of Hanley (bassist of nineteen years), Burns, and guitarist Tommy Crooks. The following day, Smith was arrested and charged with assaulting Nagle in their hotel. Despite this, Nagle remained with the band. The Smith and Nagle line-up would release two albums: \"The Marshall Suite\" (1999) and \"The Unutterable\" (2000).\n2001\u20132017: later years.\nFurther rifts within the band followed in 2001, which led to a new line-up of Smith, Ben Pritchard (guitar), Ed Blaney (guitar), Jim Watts (bass), and Spencer Birtwistle (drums) releasing \"Are You Are Missing Winner\" that year to mixed reviews. Spencer Birtwistle was replaced by Dave Milner on drums in November 2001. September 2002 saw Elena Poulou\u2013Smith's third wife\u2013fill the vacant position of keyboards player, and that year \"Q\" magazine named the Fall one of \"50 Bands to See Before You Die\". \"The Real New Fall LP\" (renamed from \"Country on the Click\" after an earlier mix of the album appeared on Internet file sharing networks) followed in 2003, with a slightly different mix and some extra tracks for the US version, after which Jim Watts was sacked (replaced by Steve Trafford) and Milner was replaced by a returning Spencer Birtwistle. In 2004 the band released its first career-spanning compilation to positive reviews in June, and a new album, Interim, in November.\nIn January 2005, the Fall were the subject of a BBC Four TV documentary, \"The Fall: The Wonderful and Frightening World of Mark E Smith\". Their twenty-fifth studio album, entitled \"Fall Heads Roll\", was issued on 3 October 2005. The guitarist, bassist, and drummer all left the group acrimoniously during the US summer 2006 tour after just four dates. In a US radio interview, Smith described their departures as \"the best thing that ever happened\" to the Fall, although it was some months before he confirmed that they would not be returning.\nEarly in 2007 the Fall released the \"Reformation Post TLC\" album, recorded with the same lineup that salvaged the 2006 US tour. Yet another lineup released \"Imperial Wax Solvent\", in 2008; this lineup would hold for the following three albums, and the core of Peter Greenway (guitar), David Spurr (bass), and Keiron Melling (drums) for the remainder of the band's existence. In April 2009, the Fall signed with UK-based independent record label Domino Records. A new studio album, titled \"Your Future Our Clutter\", was released on 26 April 2010 and followed in November 2011 by the album \"Ersatz GB\". In March 2012, the band were chosen by Jeff Mangum of Neutral Milk Hotel to perform at the All Tomorrow's Parties festival he curated in Minehead, England. The Fall released their twenty-ninth studio album, \"Re-Mit\", in 2013.\nIn 2014, former members Brix Smith Start, Steve Hanley and Paul Hanley formed a new group called Brix &amp; the Extricated. In addition to new original material, the group also performs songs that the members had written or co-written during their tenure with the Fall. Smith Start and Steve Hanley also both released autobiographies covering their tenures with the Fall around this time frame; 2016's \"The Rise, the Fall &amp; the Rise\" and 2014's \"\", respectively.\nThe Fall's thirtieth album, \"Sub-Lingual Tablet\", was released in 2015. This would be Elena Poulou's last album with the band: in a 2016 interview with \"Mojo Magazine\", Smith announced that she had resigned; they would divorce that year. The Fall's 31st and final studio album, \"New Facts Emerge,\" was recorded as a four-piece and released in July 2017. Michael Clapham joined in May 2017 on keyboards, but never recorded with the band. Following Smith's death, Greenway, Spurr and Melling recruited singer and guitarist Sam Curran to form a new band, Imperial Wax.\nDeath of Mark E. Smith.\nEarly in 2017, there were reports that Smith was ill, and over the year numerous live dates were cancelled or postponed for reasons of health, including a week's dates in New York. Having become weak due to a change in medicine, he performed some shows in a wheelchair. His final performance and last appearance in public took place at the Queen Margaret Union, Glasgow, on 4 November 2017. Another show was scheduled for the Fiddlers, Bristol, on 29 November; Smith travelled to Bristol but was then too unwell to leave his hotel room. The other members of the group made a brief appearance on stage and apologised to the people who had come to see the Fall.\nOn 24 January 2018, Smith died at his home in Prestwich, Greater Manchester after a long illness. He was 60 years old. Smith had been diagnosed with terminal lung and kidney cancer, which his family confirmed had contributed to his death. The announcement of Smith's death was made by his partner and Fall manager Pamela Vander. Smith had been an alcoholic and periodic drug user for much of his adult life, and had undergone treatment several times. His condition led to him falling and suffering bone fragmentation several times from the mid 2000s, leading to his performing several dates in a wheelchair and cast. A heavy smoker, Smith had long suffered from throat and respiratory problems; yet his work ethic or output never declined and he continued to release a new album close to once a year.\nPosthumous projects.\nIn August 2018, Cherry Red Records, the Fall's final label, announced they had purchased the rights to 40 Fall albums from Smith before his death and plan to release a reissue series and box set sometime in the future.\nSmith's vocal style and lyrics.\nSmith's vocal delivery was known for his tendency to end each phrase terminating in a consonant with an added schwa vocalisation (\"ah\"). He often spoke-sang or sing-slurred his lyrics, especially from the mid-1990s. His delivery, particularly when playing live, could be described as \"rambling\", and he often interjected improvised rants.\nHis lyrics, delivered in a heavy Mancunian accent, are often cryptic, absurdist and inscrutable, and were described by critic Simon Reynolds as \"a kind of Northern English magic realism that mixed industrial grime with the unearthly and uncanny, voiced through a unique, one-note delivery somewhere between amphetamine-spiked rant and alcohol-addled yarn.\" Smith described his approach as wanting to combine \"primitive music with intelligent lyrics\". Thematically, his frequently densely layered lyrics often centre around descriptions of urban grotesques, gloomy landscapes, \"crackpot history\", and are infused with regional slang. A newspaper obituary encapsulated his artistic character: \"Part-Anthony Burgess, part-punk-Andy Capp, Mark E Smith was a fierce art intelligence and a hero of polar opposition.\"\nFragments of Smith's lyrics often appeared handwritten on early Fall album and single covers, along with collages he had put together. In a 1983 interview with \"Sounds\", Smith said that he liked artwork to reflect the album content and that his graphic choices reflected his attitude to music. He mentioned how he was drawn to cheap and misspelled posters, amateur layouts of local papers and printed cash and carry signs with \"inverted commas where you don't need them\".\nInfluence.\nOn the group's influence, Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic wrote that \"the Fall, like many cult bands, inspired a new generation of underground bands, ranging from waves of sound-alike indie rockers in the UK to acts in America and New Zealand, which is only one indication of the size and dedication of their small, devoted fan base.\"\nThe Fall influenced groups and artists such as Pavement, Franz Ferdinand, Black Country, New Road, Yung Lean, Happy Mondays, Sonic Youth, These New Puritans, LCD Soundsystem, as well as the Russian group Grazhdanskaya Oborona. Sonic Youth covered three Fall songs (and \"Victoria\" by the Kinks, also covered by the Fall) in a 1988 Peel session, which was released in 1990 as an EP, \"4 Tunna Brix\", on Sonic Youth's own Goofin' label. The Pixies covered \"Big New Prinz\" during their 2013 world tour. The 1990s indie acts Pavement (who recorded a version of \"The Classical\") and Elastica (Smith contributed vocals to their final EP and album) showed an influence of the Fall, while Suede parodied the band with \"Implement Yeah!\", a song found on the cassette edition of their 1999 single \"Electricity\".\nMembers.\nSince the Fall formed in 1976, Mark E. Smith was the only constant member. All of the other founding members had left by the end of 1979, although Martin Bramah returned to the band from 1989 to 1990. Of the 66 musicians who came and went over the band's 40-year existence, about one third played in the band for less than a year. The final line-up consisted of Smith, Pete Greenway, Dave Spurr, Keiron Melling and Michael Clapham. Melling, Spurr and Greenway joined the band in 2006.\nSmith once remarked, in an oft-quoted quip about the band's frequent lineup changes, \"If it's me and your granny on bongos, it's The Fall.\"\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\nSource:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is a member of the S&amp;P/ASX 20 stock index, and is Australia's largest telecommunications company by market share.\nTelstra has a long history in Australia, originating together with Australia Post as the Postmaster-General's Department upon federation in 1901. Telstra had transitioned from a state-owned enterprise to a fully privatised company by 2006.\nHistory.\nAustralia's telecommunications services were originally controlled by the Postmaster-General's Department (PMG), formed in 1901 as a result of Australian Federation. Prior to 1901, telecommunications were administered by each colony. On 1 July 1975, separate commissions were established by statute to replace the PMG. Responsibility for postal services was transferred to the Australian Postal Commission (Australia Post). The Australian Telecommunications Commission, trading as Telecom Australia, ran domestic telecommunication services.\nIn 1989, the ATC introduced new buildings and frameworks.\nIn 1993, the Overseas Telecommunications Commission, a separate government body established in 1946, was merged with the Australian Telecommunications Corporation into the short-lived Australian and Overseas Telecommunications Corporation (AOTC) which continued trading under the established identities of Telecom and OTC. The AOTC was renamed to Telstra Corporation Limited in 1993.\nTelstra has faced competition since the early 1990s from Optus (Australia's second largest communication company) and a number of smaller providers. Telstra once retained ownership of the fixed-line telephone network, but since the nationwide upgrade to the National Broadband Network (NBN), the Australian Government now has legal ownership of these lines since 2007, though Telstra has played a big part in this upgrade supplying resources to the Government on the new network.. In 2025, Telstra sold its remaining 35% stake in Australian media company Foxtel.\nOverseas Telecommunications Commission.\nThe Overseas Telecommunications Commission (OTC) was established by an Act of Parliament in August 1946. It inherited facilities and resources from AWA and Cable &amp; Wireless, and was charged with responsibility for all international telecommunications services into, through and out of Australia.\nOn 1 February 1992, it was merged with Telecom as the Australian and Overseas Telecommunications Corporation (AOTC). The new organisation underwent a corporate identity review and was subsequently renamed Telstra for international business in 1993 and domestic business in 1995.\nPrivatisation.\nBeginning in 1997 and finalising in 2011, the Federal Government began to privatise the corporation. The first three stages was initiated by the Howard government: the first, informally known as \"T1\" (with shares priced at $3.30), occurred in 1997. \"T2\" ($7.40) followed in 1999; \"T3\" ($3.60) in 2006.\nIn T1, the government sold one third of its shares in Telstra for $14 billion and publicly listed the company on the Australian Securities Exchange. In 1998, a further 16% of Telstra shares were sold to the public, leaving the Australian government with 51% ownership. In 2006, T3 was announced by the government and was the largest of the three public releases, reducing the government's ownership of Telstra to 17%. The 17% remainder of Telstra was placed in the Future Fund, a sovereign wealth fund established mainly to meet future liabilities for payment of superannuation to retired federal public servants. In 2009, the Future Fund sold off another $2.4\u00a0billion worth of shares, reducing the government's stake in Telstra to 10.9%. In August 2011, under the Gillard government, the Future Fund sold its remaining \"above market weight\" Telstra shares, reducing its holding to 0.8% of the shares, effectively completing Telstra's privatisation.\nWith more than one million shareholders, Telstra is currently the most widely held ASX-listed company.\nNational Broadband Network.\nOn 26 November 2008, Telstra submitted a non-complying tender issued by the federal government to build a National Broadband Network, a 12-page letter proposing a $5\u00a0billion broadband network covering between 80 and 90 percent of the Australian population in major cities, despite the tender requiring 98 percent coverage.\nAs a result, Telstra was removed from the National Broadband Network RFP process on 15 December 2008. In response, Telstra announced that it would raise speeds on its existing Next G network and HFC \"cable\" network so that they both offer higher speeds than the RFP for the NBN requires. Following Telstra's exclusion from the National Broadband Network bidding process Telstra's share price suffered the biggest one-day percentage fall in its history.\nNBN Co Limited signed a definitive agreement with Telstra on 23 June 2011, estimated to be worth A$9 billion post-tax net present value, building upon the signing of a financial heads of agreement a year beforehand. Telstra agreed to \"disconnect\"&lt;ref name='joint-committee-16/5/11-p16'&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; its Internet customers from the copper and hybrid fibre-coaxial networks in areas where FTTP has been installed, and agreed to lease dark fibre, exchange space and ducts to NBN Co. As part of the agreement, Telstra would not be able to market their mobile network as an alternative to the NBN for a number of years. Telstra remains the owner of its networks.&lt;ref name='joint-committee-16/5/11-p16,31'&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; On 18 October 2011, Telstra shareholders overwhelmingly approved the deal.\nOn 14 December 2014 it was announced that in a A$11b renegotiated deal Telstra will transfer ownership of its copper and hybrid fibre-coaxial (HFC) networks to NBN while disconnecting premises from these networks. This ownership allows NBN Co to use these networks \"where it sees fit in for its multi-technology NBN rollout.\"\nDavid Thodey era (2010\u20132015).\nUnder the leadership of David Thodey, Telstra embarked upon a transformation agenda to become more sales and service focused.\nAs part of that, an ambitious customer service agenda was defined.\nIn 2014, Telstra was named \"most respected company\" by the Australian Financial Review newspaper.\nMarket share recovery.\nEarly in 2010, Telstra announced the creation of a $1\u00a0billion \"fighting fund\" to be used in a concerted effort to win back market share in key product categories. This effort seems to have paid off with strong sales momentum announced in February 2011.\nCustomer service recovery.\nAs part of its new strategy, Telstra announced that its \"goal is for customer service to be fundamental to everything we do\". In August 2011, Telstra Digital announced expansion of customer service into social media with 24/7 coverage. By November 2012, Telstra claimed 140,000 live chats for the month and a growth rate of this service of 600% p.a. In October 2013, Telstra announced that it had grown its Live Chat workforce to 600 and its social media workforce to 30. Customer Service became a pillar of the corporation's social responsibility ethos according to Telstra's head of social services Gerard Devan and the Telstra foundation.\nThe following table shows total complaints handled by the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman (TIO) 2010\u20132015, and of those, the ones made against Telstra.\nTelstra Digital.\nIn February 2011, Telstra announced the formation of Telstra Digital under the leadership of Gerd Schenkel who was hired from National Australia Bank/UBank. Gerd reported to Karsten Wildberger who was Group Managing Director of Telstra Consumer, and was ultimately appointed to be the new minister for digitization of Germany in 2025.\nTelstra Digital's initial purpose was to improve the use of digital channels for customer service. In April 2011, Telstra Digital relaunched its web homepage design. In July 2011, Telstra Digital launched \"CrowdSupport\", an online forum to crowd source customer service. As of July 2017, Telstra's \"CrowdSupport\" had 463,000 posts. It was also cited as an example of \"scaling at the edge\" by Deloitte's Centre for the Edge.\nIn September 2011, Telstra Digital launched a new account services portal to help achieve its goal of managing 35% of Telstra's transactions. In October 2011, Telstra Digital announced a new mobile smartphone optimised version of its website. In November 2011, Telstra Digital launched an iPhone app on a trial basis as well as a new online mobile phone shop.\nIn July 2012, Telstra Digital launched smartphone and Facebook apps for customers to manage their Telstra accounts and in November 2012, Telstra claimed that over 700,000 customers had downloaded those apps. In August 2013, Telstra revealed that the apps reached 2.5\u00a0million downloads.\nAt a results announcement, CEO David Thodey remarked that \"the group's new online strategy was delivering\" in the context of a 28% reduction of inbound service calls. Telstra estimated that its digital program will provide productivity benefits of $100\u00a0million in the 2013 financial year from lower printing costs, decreasing commissions to third parties, and reduced dependence on call centre staff.\nIn October 2012, Telstra's CEO David Thodey stated, \"The rise of online and social media had 'fundamentally changed the way' which the company communicated with its customers\". In a 2015 Deloitte report, Telstra disclosed that its \"CrowdSupport\" service community had generated 200,000 pieces of user-generated content. In August 2016, Telstra disclosed that \"more than 60%\" of visitors to \"CrowdSupport\" manage to find an answer on the community.\nIn February 2013, Telstra introduced the ability to pay its bills via PayPal. And in June 2013, Telstra launched a new website, including the ability for customers to link their online accounts to their Facebook identity.\nIn March 2014, Telstra announced a new digital development program called \"Digital First\" with a stated aim to conduct 65 to 70 percent of its transactions online. Telstra published a white paper sharing some key metrics of its digital and in 2020 a streaming platform in partnership with Walt Disney APAC under Sally Steer of Telstra InfraCo and Gerard Devan Group Executive APAC of Walt Disney, a comprehensive digital program:\nIn September 2014, Telstra announced the opening of a \"Digital Transformation Centre\" in Sydney to design and built new digital tools for its service systems.\nIn June 2014, Telstra disclosed that it had 3 million customers on \"electronic billing\" saving it $3\u00a0million per month in costs. Telstra also mentioned that live chat accounted for 10% of total contact centre activity and in 2020 the Telstra partnership with Walt Disney APAC under Gerard Devan Group Executive of Disney.\nIn December 2015, Telstra Digital launched customer service on Periscope.\nIn October 2016, the executive director of Telstra Digital Gerd Schenkel left Telstra to become CEO of a fintech company.\nRetail store network.\nTelstra owns and operates a series of retail stores known as Telstra Stores. Some are directly owned and operated by Telstra and some are operated by licensees.\nAs of May 2016, Telstra has a total of 360 retail stores across Australia. This includes several new 'Discovery' stores, where Telstra has invested millions in redesigning key stores based on local requirements. Many stores were part of the Westfield Retail Stores and Westfield was won to Telstra Under David Thodey's Strategic Pursuite team lead by Gerard Devan in 2006 - 2012 period a deal with $110 Million, which brought the Telstra relationship with Westfield closer. These new 'Discovery' stores, designs include new displays, accessory shops, digital tickets and free baristas.\n109 of Telstra's stores are owned and operated by Vita Group, a publicly listed company with a market capitalisation of approximately $600m (June 2016).\nIn February 2011, Telstra announced the creation of an additional 100 retail stores within three years.\nThe carrier opened the world's first Android store, called \"Androidland\", on Bourke Street, Melbourne, Australia, in December 2011.\nThese developments built on Telstra's T[life] concept stores it had launched in the early 2000s.\nShare price development.\nIn November 1997, the Australian government sold the first tranche of its Telstra shares, 4.29 Billion shares, publicly at a price of $3.40 per share to institutional investors and $3.30 to retail investors. This sale is commonly referred to as \"T1\". In October 1999, the Australian government sold the second tranche of its Telstra shares under the \"T2\" program for $7.80 per share to institutional investors and $7.40 to retail investors. In November 2006, the government sold a third tranche of its shares, \"T3\", at $3.60 per share.\nSince its privatisation, Telstra shares have hit a low of just over $2.50 per share in late 2010. Since then, Telstra shares have risen to $5 per share in December 2013 and $6 per share in December 2014.\nOn 17 May 2019 the shares closed on the ASX at $3.56 up from a twelve-month low of $2.547 per share\nIn February 2014, Telstra raised its dividend from 14c to 14.5c per share.\nAmid the global pandemic crisis of the coronavirus in 2020, Telstra was one of three companies of the ASX 200 to gain in the week starting 15 March. It increased by 1.8 percent on the Australian Securities Exchange.\nSale of Sensis.\nIn January 2014, Telstra announced its intention to sell 70% of Sensis to Platinum Equity for $454\u00a0million. Sensis was said to have once been \"one of Telstra's most lucrative businesses\" and reportedly \"has been under pressure in recent years amid competition from more agile digital alternatives such as Google\".\nIn February 2014, Telstra was reportedly seeking to reduce Sensis employment by 400 to 1,000 positions.\nNew health business unit.\nIn September 2013, Telstra launched a new health business unit \u2013 Telstra Health and hired Shane Solomon as the head.\nIn September 2016, Telstra Health was awarded a $220m government contract amidst claims of \"lack of transparency\".\nShane Solomon left Telstra in Nov 2016.\nNational Broadband Network (NBN).\nIn December 2014, Telstra signed an agreement with the federal government's A.C.N. 86 136 533 741 (NBN Co) Limited. This agreement is said to retain the $11b value for Telstra of the original agreement from October 2011 and will see the company progressively sell its copper and Hybrid fiber-coaxial networks to A.C.N. 86 136 533 741 (NBN Co) Limited.\nAndrew Penn era (2015\u20132022).\nOn 19 February 2015, Telstra announced that CEO David Thodey would retire on 1 May 2015 and be replaced by successor Andy Penn. Penn's era was marked by the very difficult transition to the NBN, a government policy decision which had significant implications for Telstra. Penn indicated new focus on growth in the core business with a pulling back from international markets, including the discontinuation of a joint venture to build a mobile phone network in the Philippines. On 14 March 2016, Telstra ended their talks between the company and the Philippine-based conglomerate San Miguel Corporation for a planned joint telecommunications venture in the Philippines due to several factors.\nIn 2016, Telstra suffered a series of network outages for which the company apologised. In December of that year, Telstra announced the appointment of Robyn Denholm as its new COO, following the departure of Kate McKenzie who left after the network outages. In December, Telstra announced the hire of a new CTO to replace the predecessor who left amongst allegations of CV fraud. In 2016, the government raised the possibility that Telstra's regional mobile network may be forced to be opened to competitor' use under a roaming scheme. A prospect strongly being fought by Telstra. Penn announced a $3bn investment program to strength its networks and as a platform for future digital investments.\nIn February 2017, Telstra announced that revenue had dropped 3.5%, Net Profit After Tax had dropped by over 14% due to the impact of the rollout of the NBN by the Australian Government. As a result, Telstra's share price dropped by 4.5% on the same day. In August 2017, Telstra announced that it would cut its dividend in response to the financial implications of the NBN and to fund its network investments, leading to a drop in share price by over 10% in a single day to reach a 5-year low.\nT22 strategy.\nIn June 2018, Telstra announced its Telstra2022 strategy designed to face into headwinds from the NBN rollout and return the business to growth. Composed of four pillars, the strategy was designed to remove $1\u00a0billion of operating costs from the business, simplifying its overall structure and leading to six key outcomes: improve customer experiences, simplify its products and operating model, extend network superiority and 5G leadership, achieve global high performance in employee engagement, reduce net productivity costs, and attain a return on capital investment post the NBN rollout.\nOn 20 June 2018, Telstra announced a reduction of 9,500 jobs (8,000 net job losses after considering 1,500 new roles to be created) as part of its \"Telstra 2022\" (T22) plan.\nInfraCo.\nCreated on 1 July 2018, Telstra InfraCo would serve as the infrastructure business, owning an estimated $11\u00a0billion AUD in assets made up of data centres, non-mobiles related domestic fibre, copper, HFC, subsea cables, exchanges, poles, ducts, and pipes. InfraCo opened its dark fibre network across six Australian state capitals in February 2021. Telstra said the dark fibre network would open up a wealth of capabilities and control for its targeted audience of network operates and service providers such as global carriers, data centre operators, internet service producers and over the top providers according to Infrastructure Chief Ross Lambi.\nRetail store strategy.\nIn February 2021, Telstra announced plans to take back full ownership of its 337 retail stores. At the time of the announcement Telstra owned and operated 67 of its stores, Vita Group owned and operated 104 stores, and the remaining 166 were operated by individual licensees. The process of transitioning stores back to Telstra ownership took around 12 to 18 months to complete. As part of the T22 program Telstra also brought its call centres back on shore.\nUltimately the T22 strategy proved to be very successful with a significant improvement in customer metrics, employee engagement, a return to profitable growth supported by a $2.7 bn reduction in annualised costs. Telstra's share price increased more than 50% from a low in 2018 of $2.63 to more than $4 in 2022.\nOn 14 July 2022, Telstra finalised their acquisition of Digicel Pacific, a telecommunications company operating in Papua New Guinea, Vanuatu, Fiji, Samoa, Tonga and Nauru.\nVicki Brady era (2022\u2013present).\nOn 30 March 2022, Telstra announced that Vicki Brady would become the new chief executive officer effective 1 September 2022. In December 2023, Telstra acquired Versent, a provider of cloud transformation and security products and services, for $267.5 million.\nOn 1 February 2022, Telsta announced it would temporarily cease selling Foxtel from Telstra services to new customers.\nOn 21 May 2024, Brady announced plans to lay off 2,800 employees by the end of 2024. Most of these roles would be in the B2B Telstra Enterprise division, with 377 roles in consultancy for redundancy. Brady said the changes were part of the company's transition towards AI technology. Communication Workers Union national assistant secretary James Perkins criticised the lack of staff warning prior to the announcement.\nIn December 2024, Telstra announced it would acquire Boost Mobile, an MVNO which operates on its mobile network.\nOn 23 December 2024, Telstra announced it would sell the remaining 35% holding of the Foxtel Group to DAZN for a $135m and gaining a 3% shareholding in DAZN.\nProducts and services.\nFixed-line and mobile telephony.\nTelstra is Australia's incumbent and largest provider of fixed-line services. These include home phone, business and other PSTN products.\nTelstra outsources a significant portion of network installation and maintenance to private contractors and joint ventures, such as ABB Communications and STCJV (Siemens Thiess Communications Joint Venture).\nTelstra also owns and maintains the majority of Australia's public telephones. In 2006, Telstra announced it would remove many of the phones, citing vandalism and the increasing adoption of mobile telephones. Telstra's support page has a payphones section where information about their plans to add, remove, or move payphones can be found.\nTelstra Mobile is Australia's largest mobile telephone service providers, in terms of both subscriptions and coverage. Telstra operates Australia's largest GSM and 3G UMTS (branded as Next G) mobile telephony networks in Australia, as well as holding a 50% stake in the 3GIS Ltd 2100\u00a0MHz UMTS network infrastructure, shared with Hutchison (Three). In September 2007, Telstra had an estimated 9.3M mobile subscribers. Telstra Mobile services are available in post-paid and prepaid payment types, known as Telstra Pre-Paid (formerly communic8 Pre-Paid).\nTelstra's GSM network was the first digital mobile network in Australia. It was launched in April 1993 on the 900\u00a0MHz band as \"Telstra MobileNet Digital\". The GSM network has carried the majority of Telstra's mobile subscribers for the last 10 years and has seen numerous upgrades. 1800\u00a0MHz capacity channels were added to the network in the late 1990s as well as GPRS packet data transmission capabilities. As part of the UMTS Next G deployment, the GSM network was also upgraded to a full EDGE data transmission capability in 2006 providing data transmission capabilities greater than 40\u00a0kbit/s on its GSM network.\nIn 1981, Telstra (then Telecom Australia) was the first company to provide mobile telephony services in Australia. The first automated mobile service operated in the major capital cities on 500\u00a0MHz using the '007' dialling prefix. This network only provided \"car phone\" capabilities to subscribers as portable hand-held terminals were not practical at that time. The first cellular system in Australia offering portable hand-held phones was launched by Telstra in 1987 using the AMPS analogue standard on the 800\u00a0MHz band. This network at its peak had over 1 million subscribers, but was mandated by the government to be closed down by 2000, partially due to privacy concerns which resulted from the AMPS technology, but also because of arrangements undertaken to secure sufficient interest in the GSM network licenses offered in 1992 to competitors. A license condition placed on Telstra to maintain an equivalent coverage footprint at the time resulted in Telstra deciding to deploy an IS-95 CDMA network in its place.\nTelstra operated over 7,400 Next G Base Stations in 2010.\nInternet.\nWholesale.\nTelstra Wholesale provides products such as Data, Mobile, Voice, and other Facilities (including Co-location and Duct Access) to other companies and organisations for re-sale. Telstra Wholesale also provides operational support for its customers, and facilities for international customers such as International Data Transport and IP Transport.\nDue to Telstra's position as Australia's incumbent telecommunications provider, Telstra Wholesale is the incumbent and dominant wholesaler of ADSL services to other Internet Service Providers. Telstra installed the first DSLAMs in exchanges prior to 2000, and began wholesaling access in late 2000. Telstra Wholesale has a comprehensive network of ADSL DSLAMs (the largest in Australia) and allows competitors access to each Telstra DSLAM at up to ADSL2+ speeds if available, and at ADSL1 speeds should 2+ be unavailable. Telstra Wholesale customer Optus Communications loss of Westfield to Telstra Enterprise under David Thodey\u2019s strategic pursuite team led by Gerard Devan was a landmark loss to the Wholesale operation in the 2006 - 2012 period.\nSince 2013, Telstra has wholesaled its 3G and 4G network. However the wholesale product only gives access to 7000 of Telstra's over 8000 base stations, and does not include access to its faster 4GX and 5G networks.\nRetail internet.\nAs an internet service provider (ISP), Telstra provides internet services for personal and business clients. Telstra uses various delivery methods for its internet products via BigPond (now Telstra Media), including ADSL, Cable Internet, Dialup, Satellite, and Wireless Internet (through the Next G network)).\nAt the end of the 2007 financial year, BigPond had over two million broadband subscribers. In 2007 a survey of 14,000 people by PC Authority magazine found BigPond users rated poorly for customer service, and less than a third considered their service value for money. However, BigPond argued that the survey's structure had encouraged people to provide extreme opinions. In January 2009, Telstra was ranked as the top Australian ISP in terms of performance by Epitiro.\nCable internet.\nTelstra owned and operated the largest cable internet Hybrid Fibre cable network in Australia. Telstra Cable operates in selected cities and areas of Australia including (Melbourne, Brisbane, Canberra, Sydney, Perth, Adelaide and the Gold Coast), providing downstream speeds of up to 30\u00a0Mbit/s in selected areas. The upgrade to 100\u00a0Mbit/s was complete in Melbourne by Christmas 2009, and launched the new DOCSIS 3.0 services on 1 December 2009 before the deadline.\nThis network has since been acquired by the National Broadband Network Company (NBNCo) for public cable broadband but is still used to distribute Cable TV under the Foxtel brand.\nNaked DSL \u2013 A six-week trial of two kinds of naked DSL to \"assess customer demand\" was launched on 1 June 2010. 'Pure DSL' having the ability to receive incoming calls and make emergency calls, and 'Naked DSL' being offered without a dial tone.\nADSL internet.\nOn 10 November 2006, Telstra made two major changes to their ADSL network. The first was an increase of wholesale ADSL speeds from 1.5\u00a0Mbit/s/256\u00a0kbit/s to 8\u00a0Mbit/s/384\u00a0kbit/s. Telstra also released an ADSL2+ broadband service offering download speeds of up to 24\u00a0Mbit/s from exchanges where competitors were already offering ADSL2+ services.\nOn 6 February 2008, Telstra announced that it would activate high-speed ADSL2+ broadband in a further 900 telephone exchanges serving 2.4\u00a0million consumers across every state and territory in Australia. Telstra also claimed that it has received assurances from the Government that it would not be forced to wholesale these services to other providers, and that the move came \"after the Government made clear it did not consider a compelling case had been made for regulating third-party access to the service\u00a0\u2013 an assurance sought by Telstra for more than one year\".\nOn 10 June 2008, it was announced that Telstra was in discussions with some wholesale customers in reference to wholesaling ADSL2+ services.\nLow-cost mobile and internet brand.\nIn October 2013 Telstra launched \"Belong\", a low-cost mobile and internet service provider. As of February 2020, Belong has over 600,000 services made up of almost 340,000 mobile services and around 300,000 broadband internet services. Belong is Australia's first carbon neutral telecommunications provider certified by Climate Active, a partnership between the Australian Government and businesses that encourages voluntary action to reduce the impacts of climate change.\nSubscription television.\nIn 1995 Telstra in a joint venture with News Corp Australia lauched a Foxtel a Subscription TV service that used Telstra's former hybrid fiber-coaxial (commonly referred to as \"cable\") network. In 2018 Telstra's 50% shareholding of Foxtel was reduced to 35% when Fox Sports Australia merged with Foxtel.\nIn February 2024 Telstra announced it would Telstra will temporarily stop selling Foxtel from Telstra until further notice, but would continue to support existing customers.\nOn 23 December 2024 Telstra announced that it would sell its 35% shareholding of the Foxtel for $135m and a 3% shareholding of DAZN.\nEntertainment and content.\nBigPond Music.\nMOG, a subscription online music service and blog network, announced a partnership with Telstra offer their product in Australia \u2013 the first region outside of the United States to have access. Telstra and MOG launched under the BigPond Music branding on 21 June 2012,\nBigPond Games and GameArena.\nGameArena was a website dedicated to video gaming operating under the BigPond brand that was managed by Mammoth Media and based on the east coast of Australia. The site provided news, downloads and servers primarily for the PC, and Mac, though it later branched out to include console sites. GameArena provided an online game shop GameNow, which sported various benefits to Telstra customers.\nUsage of the GameArena file library, gaming servers and booking service were freely available to anyone, but provided specific advantages to Telstra customers such as preference in downloads and unmetered usage, as well as various bonuses in competitions. In 2005, GameArena went through a new shift with the merging of GameNow and Gameshop into itself. The name became simply BigPond GameArena.\nGameArena once operated over 100 gaming servers, which were monitored by a volunteer force of administrators, known as GameOps. \"GameCreate\" was a service offered free of charge where users may book a server for a specific game for a 2-hour period of time. This server was private and could be used for either ladder training or social events.\nGameArena servers and its website closed on 20 October 2014.\nThe Pond in \"Second Life\".\nTelstra BigPond owned and operated a number of virtual islands in the online game \"Second Life\" for approximately three years. BigPond closed its \"Second Life\" presence in December 2009.\nFacebook.\nIn 2011, Telstra launched \"Blurtl\", a Facebook application that allows the user to leave audio messages on their Facebook walls.\nPayphones.\nIn 2021, Telstra made its pay phones free\nMobile networks.\nThe following is a list of known active mobile networks used by Telstra:\nFebruary 2011: Ericsson wins the LTE contract with Telstra. The LTE network is being deployed in capital city CBDs and select regional centres throughout 2011. It will operate at 1800\u00a0MHz and integrate with a HSPA+ service at 850\u00a0MHz. A dual mode (LTE/HSPA+) mobile broadband device has been developed for the network.\nJanuary 2012: Initial major LTE rollout complete. Incremental rollout continues, widening the coverage in capital cities and introducing new LTE coverage to regional centres.\nJuly 2012: Telstra commences retailing a pocket-sized battery powered 4G WiFi router (ZTE MF91) for prepaid data customers, locked to Telstra, complementing its range of 4G-capable devices. Apart from the ZTE MF91, the Telstra 4G hardware range now comprises two dual mode (4G/3G) voice-capable handsets by HTC and ZTE (available for purchase outright or on a post-paid plan), a Sierra USB wireless modem (outright or post-paid plan), a ZTE USB wireless modem (prepaid, locked to Telstra) and a Sierra 4G Wifi battery powered pocket-sized router (outright or post-paid plan). Telstra is reported to now be operating LTE facilities from more than 3,500 transmission sites.\nAugust 2013: Telstra demonstrates the world's first ever LTE- Advanced Carrier Aggregation network using the 900\u00a0MHz and 1800\u00a0MHz spectrum bands in the Sunshine Coast.\nApril 2014: Telstra introduced a mobile broadband device from Huawei (\"E5786\") with LTE Advanced capability.\nMay 2014: Telstra and Ericsson demonstrate world first 450\u00a0Mbit/s LTE-A downlink speeds in a commercial network with a Category 9 device.\nSeptember 2015: Telstra, in collaboration with NETGEAR, Ericsson and Qualcomm Technologies announce that it is bringing the world's first 4G LTE Advanced 600\u00a0Mbit/s Category 11 device to customers.\nSeptember 2016: Telstra conducts the first live 5G trial in Australia with Ericsson, demonstrating 5G capabilities in a real world environment, including speed and beam steering tests.\nDecember 2016: Telstra shuts down the 900\u00a0MHz GSM/EDGE network on 1 December. Prior to this, EDGE data capabilities were available on 100% of the GSM networks used.\nJanuary 2017: Telstra launches world's first Gigabit LTE-Advanced mobile network.\nMarch 2019: Telstra closed the 2100\u00a0MHz (Band 1) section of its 3G network on 25 March.\nMay 2020: Telstra made available Australia's first 5G network using 3500\u00a0MHz spectrum.\nApril 2021: Telstra purchased via Auction 1000\u00a0MHz of 26\u00a0GHz (26,000\u00a0MHz) Spectrum nationally for 5G mmWave technology.\nDecember 2021: Telstra purchased via auction an additional 10\u00a0MHz paired of 850\u00a0MHz spectrum to put to use for their network.\nNovember 2023: Telstra purchased via auction 55-110\u00a0MHz of additional 5G spectrum to boost capacity on their 5G network. Key markets such as Melbourne and Sydney gained an additional 80\u00a0MHz.\nOn 28 October 2024, Telstra will be closing its 3G network, saying \"It's about providing a better experience for our customers.\" Telstra says that the closure of its 3G network will allow them to \"repurpose spectrum to support [Telstra's] 5G rollout.\" In October 2019, Telstra had announced 3G's closure to be in June 2024, but has since been moved to 28 October 2024.\nNext G network.\nIn 2005, Telstra announced a plan to upgrade its ageing networks and systems; which includes a new 3G network to replace the then current CDMA mobile network.\nThe network was built between November 2005 and September 2006, and launched in October 2006. As of 2007[ [update]], Next G was the largest mobile network in Australia, providing greater coverage than other 3G providers in Australia and over three times greater than any 2G provider in Australia. In December 2008, the Next G Network was also the fastest mobile network in the World, delivering theoretical network speeds of up to 21\u00a0Mbit/s\n using features of HSPA+ and Dual-Carrier HSPA+. In February 2010, Telstra increased the speed up to 42\u00a0Mbit/s making the Next G Network once again the fastest mobile network in the world.\nOn 26 September 2011, Telstra launched its 4G 1800\u00a0MHz LTE network, claiming typical download speeds of up to 40\u00a0Mbit/s.\nThe network is currently[ [update]] used for BigPond's wireless broadband service and Telstra Mobile, which is Australia's largest mobile telephone service provider, in terms of both subscriptions and coverage\nNetwork design.\nIt was built to replace Telstra's CDMA network which operated from 1999 until 28 April 2008. Telstra opted to use the 850\u00a0MHz band for Next G in preference to the more common 2100\u00a0MHz band, since it requires fewer base stations to provide coverage, providing a lower capital cost. This network was implemented under contract by Ericsson as part of a project internally dubbed \"Project Jersey\" and launched on 6 October 2006. HSPA technology was included in the network to provide Australia's first wide area wireless broadband network. The efficiency of the Next G network and its coverage has been challenged and scrutinised since its launch, requiring Telstra to go back to areas with average coverage, particularly rural towns to improve its coverage footprint. On 18 January 2008, Stephen Conroy, Minister for Communications, declined the proposal for Telstra to switch off its CDMA network on 28 January 2008, stating that whilst the Next G network provided coverage equal to or better than the CDMA network, the range of handsets available was not yet satisfactory. On 15 April 2008, the Minister gave approval to close the CDMA network after 28 April 2008. Telstra closed the network nationally during the early morning hours of 29 April 2008.\nWhile most wireless modems offered by Telstra allow peak download speeds of up to 7.2\u00a0Mbit/s, a modem by Sierra Wireless was announced in 2009 that supported increased throughput. The \"USB 306\" is marketed and sold by Telstra as the \"Telstra Turbo 21 Modem\", and was available in limited quantity in early 2009. By April, the \"Turbo 21\" was available to customers and offered peak download speeds of 21\u00a0Mbit/s, although actual speeds vary between 550\u00a0kbit/s and 8\u00a0Mbit/s. As of \u00a02009[ [update]], Next G network HSUPA upgrades in selected regional and metropolitan areas, combined with software updates for the \"Turbo 21\" modem, will allow peak uplink speeds of up to 5.76\u00a0Mbit/s.\n4GX.\nOn 1 January 2015, Telstra launched, what it calls \"4GX\": a 700\u00a0MHz based component of its mobile network claiming speeds of up to 75\u00a0Mbit/s with compatible devices. 4GX has been expanded up to a 5 x Carrier Aggregation LTE Advanced Pro network, with up to two gigabits of capacity in selected locations using 700, 1800, 2100 and 2600\u00a0MHz frequencies.\nBusiness Technology Services (BTS).\nIn January 2016, Telstra announced its acquisition of cloud service provider Kloud. This was followed closely by the acquisition of application development company Readify in July 2016.\nMarket position.\nSince the Australian telecommunications industry was deregulated in the early 1990s, Telstra has managed to remain the largest provider of telecommunications services despite the emergence of rivals Optus and TPG Telecom. A \"Harvard Business Review\" article from 2005 authored by a consultant to Telstra on this topic, reported \"that a strategy of offering lower rates on some routes and at certain times of day, even though its prices, on average, were higher than its rivals\", helped Telstra retain several points of market share it otherwise may have lost.\nIn early 2011, Telstra successfully extended its market share lead by discounting its mobile phone products.\nBy 2020, Telstra's revenue was $26.2\u00a0billion, Optus' was $9.0 billion, and TPG Telecom's was $4.4 billion.\nAdvertising.\nThe name \"Telstra\" is derived from \"Telecom Australia\". The corporation then traded under the \"Telstra\" brand internationally and \"Telecom Australia\" domestically until uniform branding of \"Telstra\" was introduced throughout the entire organisation in 1995, following an unsuccessful attempt to register the trademark \"Telecom Australia\".\nIn October 2011, Telstra launched a new brand identity and colour scheme. The new identity launched with the slogan \"It's how we connect\", and features the \"T\" from the previous logo in a variety of colors. This was followed by a \"brand refresh\" in February 2014 and again in 2016. In 2013, Telstra was assessed as Australia's third most valuable brand, after Woolworths and BHP Billiton. In 2016 Telstra became Australia's most valuable brand, which it maintained in 2017.\nTelstra sponsors numerous awards around Australia, including the Australian Business of the Year award, the MYOB Small Business Award, and the National Aboriginal &amp; Torres Strait Islander Art Award (NATSIAA) which has become known as the Telstra Award. Notable past winners include Vaxine, APS Plastics, and eWAY. Telstra also set up a social services CEO round table under Gerard Devan which acted as a \"Think Tank\" to the sector.\nTelstra was a major sponsor of the V8 Supercars car racing championship through its BigPond brand and directly sponsored the Sydney Telstra 500 event, the final round of the series held at Sydney Olympic Park. The sport ended this deal at the conclusion of the 2012 season.\nTelstra had naming rights to the Docklands Stadium in Melbourne from 2002 until 2009. Telstra is also the naming rights sponsor of the National Rugby League Premiership. Telstra is also the principal sponsor of Swimming Australia. They also sponsored the Minardi team for the 2002 Formula One season, and the Rally Australia 2006 Championships.\nTelstra also had the naming rights (under TelstraClear) for the TelstraClear Pacific events centre in Manukau City, New Zealand.\nIn September 2021 Telstra solutions and Telstra Purple announced a partnership with eVTOL racing series Airspeeder. The deal centred around providing a service to transmit terabytes of data for vehicle to vehicle and vehicle to infrastructure communications for the EXA series. This deal incorporated on-vehicle branding for Telstra.\nInternational holdings.\nTelstra has over 200 subsidiary businesses as of 30 June 2016. The full list can be found at their website.\nA list of major businesses that Telstra owns can be found here under:\nControversies.\nProject Patrick.\nIn 2001 Telstra launched a secretive bid to purchase Channel 9 from the Packer PBL Empire. It was driven by the chairman Bob Mansfield, CEO Ziggy Switkowski and Group Managing Directors Ted Pretty. John Stanhope and others. The Howard government intervened and stopped the purchase but the debacle was captured on ABC's \"Four Corners\" program the same year. Telstra employees which were part of the project team included Brian Stapleton, John Losco. Pat Fuery, David Long, Gerard Devan and Mark Todd were disbanded and the project shelved.\nWotNext.\nIn January 2007 Telstra launched WotNext, a video-publishing website that allowed users to upload videos. The video content was then sold to mobile users for A$1, which the uploader and Telstra split equally. The website was shut down in December 2007 after a media backlash over uploaded semi-pornographic videos.\n2011 Privacy investigation.\nOn 12 July 2011, the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner (OAIC) released the findings of its investigation into a mailing list error that resulted in approximately 60,300 Telstra customers' personal information being sent to other customers. The Australian Privacy Commissioner Timothy Pilgrim said that the OAIC investigation confirmed that while Telstra breached the Privacy Act when the personal information of a number of its customers was disclosed to third parties, this incident was caused by a one-off human error. The OAIC concluded that Telstra had taken steps to protect the personal information of its customers including privacy obligations in agreements with mailing houses, privacy impact assessments, and procedures to ensure staff handle personal information appropriately during mail campaigns. After becoming aware of the mailing list error, the commissioner determined that Telstra had acted \"immediately\" to prevent further breaches, notify customers, review its data security practices, and counselling staff involved the accidental data leak.\nChristchurch mosque shootings.\nOn 20 March 2019, Telstra blocked access to 4chan, 8chan, Zero Hedge, and Liveleak as a reaction to the Christchurch mosque shootings.\nRace relations.\nIn May 2021, the Federal Court of Australia ordered the company to pay a $50\u00a0million fine for mistreating their Indigenous customers by encouraging them to sign up to plans they did not need or could not afford.\nIn 2023, Telstra declared support for the Yes campaign in the 2023 Australian Indigenous Voice referendum, citing their \"strong ties to Indigenous communities and employees\".\nOutage.\nWhile the 2025 Optus emergency calling outage was gaining significant media attention, Telstra also suffered an outage that lasted for 12hours in the south west of Western Australia.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "31535", "revid": "41646249", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31535", "title": "Timothy McVeigh", "text": "American domestic terrorist (1968\u20132001)\nTimothy James McVeigh (April 23, 1968 \u2013 June 11, 2001) was an American domestic terrorist who masterminded and perpetrated the Oklahoma City bombing on April 19, 1995. The bombing itself killed 167 or 168 people (including 19 children), injured 684 people, and destroyed one-third of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building. A rescue worker was killed after the bombing when debris struck her head, bringing the total to 168\u2013169 killed. It remains the deadliest act of domestic terrorism in U.S. history.\nA Gulf War veteran, McVeigh became radicalized by antigovernment beliefs. He sought revenge against the United States federal government for the 1993 Waco siege, as well as the 1992 Ruby Ridge incident. McVeigh expressed particular disapproval of federal agencies such as the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (ATF) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) for their handling of issues regarding private citizens. He hoped to inspire a revolution against the federal government, and he defended the bombing as a legitimate tactic against what he saw as a tyrannical government. He was arrested shortly after the bombing and indicted on 160 state offenses and 11 federal offenses, including the use of a weapon of mass destruction. He was found guilty on all counts in 1997 and sentenced to death.\nMcVeigh was executed by lethal injection on June 11, 2001, at the Federal Correctional Complex in Terre Haute, Indiana. His execution, which took place just over six years after the offense, was carried out in a considerably shorter time than for most inmates awaiting execution, due in part to his refusal to pursue appeals or stays of execution.\nEarly life.\nTimothy James McVeigh was born on April 23, 1968, in Lockport, New York, the only son and the second of three children of his Irish American parents, Noreen Mildred \"Mickey\" Hill and William McVeigh. In 1866, McVeigh's great-great-grandfather Edward McVeigh emigrated from Ireland and settled in Niagara County. After McVeigh's parents divorced when he was ten years old, he was raised by his father in Pendleton, New York.\nMcVeigh claimed to have been a target of bullying at school, and he took refuge in a fantasy world where he imagined retaliating against the bullies. Most who knew McVeigh remember him as being very shy and withdrawn while a few described him as an outgoing and playful child who withdrew as an adolescent. He is said to have had only one girlfriend as an adolescent; he later told journalists that he did not have any idea how to impress girls.\nWhile in high school McVeigh became interested in computers, and hacked into government computer systems on his Commodore 64 under the handle The Wanderer, taken from the song by Dion DiMucci. In his senior year he was named \"most promising computer programmer\" of Starpoint Central High School (as well as \"Most Talkative\" by his classmates as a joke as he did not speak much) but had relatively poor grades until his 1986 graduation.\nHe was introduced to firearms by his grandfather. McVeigh told people of his wish to become a gun shop owner and sometimes took firearms to school to impress his classmates. He became intensely interested in gun rights as well as the Second Amendment to the United States Constitution after he graduated from high school and read magazines such as \"Soldier of Fortune\". He briefly attended Bryant &amp; Stratton College before dropping out. After dropping out of college, McVeigh worked as an armored car guard and was noted by co-workers as being obsessed with guns. One co-worker recalled an instance when McVeigh came to work \"looking like Pancho Villa\" as he was wearing bandoliers.\nMilitary career.\nIn May 1988, at the age of 20, McVeigh enlisted in the United States Army and attended Basic Training and Advanced Individual Training at the U.S. Army Infantry School at Fort Benning, Georgia. While in the military, McVeigh used much of his spare time to read about firearms, sniper tactics, and explosives. McVeigh was reprimanded by the military for purchasing a \"White Power\" T-shirt at a Ku Klux Klan rally where they were objecting to black servicemen who wore \"Black Power\" T-shirts around a military installation (primarily Army). His future co-conspirator Terry Nichols was his platoon guide. He and Nichols quickly got along with their similar backgrounds as well as their views on gun collecting and survivalism. The two were later stationed together at Fort Riley in Junction City, Kansas, where they met and became friends with their future accomplice, Michael Fortier.\nMcVeigh was a top-scoring gunner with the M242 25mm cannon of the Bradley Fighting Vehicles used by the 1st Infantry Division and was promoted to sergeant. After being promoted, McVeigh earned a reputation for assigning undesirable work to black servicemen and using derogatory language. He was stationed at Fort Riley before being deployed on Operation Desert Storm.\nIn an interview before his execution, McVeigh said that he hit an Iraqi tank more than 500 yards away on his first day in the war and then the Iraqis surrendered. He also decapitated an Iraqi soldier with cannon fire from 1,100 yards away. He said he was later shocked to see carnage on the road while leaving Kuwait City after U.S. troops routed the Iraqi Army. McVeigh received several service awards, including the Bronze Star Medal National Defense Service Medal, Southwest Asia Service Medal, Army Service Ribbon, and the Kuwaiti Liberation Medal.\nMcVeigh aspired to join the United States Army Special Forces (SF). After returning from the Gulf War, he entered the selection program, but withdrew on the second day of the 21-day assessment and selection course for the Special Forces, telling other recruits that he had injured an ankle. However, in a letter to his superiors, McVeigh wrote that he was not \"physically ready\". McVeigh decided to leave the Army and was honorably discharged in 1991.\nPost-military life.\nMcVeigh wrote letters to local newspapers complaining about taxes. In 1992, he wrote to the \"Lockport Union-Sun &amp; Journal\":\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Taxes are a joke. Regardless of what a political candidate \"promises,\" they will increase. More taxes are always the answer to government mismanagement. They mess up. We suffer. Taxes are reaching cataclysmic levels, with no slowdown in sight. [...] Is a Civil War Imminent? Do we have to shed blood to reform the current system? I hope it doesn't come to that. But it might.\nMcVeigh also wrote to Representative John J. LaFalce (D\u2013New York), complaining about the arrest of a woman for carrying mace: &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;It is a lie if we tell ourselves that the police can protect us everywhere at all times. Firearms restrictions are bad enough, but now a woman can't even carry Mace in her purse?\nMcVeigh later moved with Nichols to Nichols' brother James' farm around Decker, Michigan. While visiting friends, McVeigh reportedly complained that the Army had implanted a microchip into his buttocks so that the government could keep track of him. McVeigh worked long hours in a dead-end job and felt that he did not have a home. He sought romance, but his advances were rejected by a co-worker and he felt nervous around women. He believed that he brought too much pain to his loved ones. He grew angry and frustrated at his difficulties in finding a girlfriend. He took up obsessive gambling. Unable to pay gambling debts, he took a cash advance and then defaulted on his repayments. He began looking for a state with low taxes so that he could live without heavy government regulation or high taxes. He became enraged when the government told him that he had been overpaid $1,058 while in the Army and he had to pay back the money. He wrote an angry letter to the government, saying: &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Go ahead, take everything I own; take my dignity. Feel good as you grow fat and rich at my expense; sucking my tax dollars and property.\nMcVeigh introduced his sister to antigovernment literature, but his father had little interest in these views. He moved out of his father's house and into an apartment that had no telephone. This made it impossible for his employer to contact him for overtime assignments. He quit the National Rifle Association of America (NRA), believing that it was too weak on gun rights.\n1993 Waco siege and gun shows.\nIn 1993, McVeigh drove to Waco, Texas, during the Waco siege to show his support. At the scene, he distributed pro-gun rights literature and bumper stickers bearing slogans such as, \"When guns are outlawed, I will become an outlaw.\" He told a student reporter:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The government is afraid of the guns people have because they have to have control of the people at all times. Once you take away the guns, you can do anything to the people. You give them an inch and they take a mile. I believe we are slowly turning into a socialist government. The government is continually growing bigger and more powerful, and the people need to prepare to defend themselves against government control.\nFor the five months following the Waco siege, McVeigh worked at gun shows and handed out free cards printed with the name and address of Lon Horiuchi, an FBI sniper, \"in the hope that somebody in the Patriot movement would assassinate the sharpshooter.\" Horiuchi's actions while an FBI agent have drawn controversy, specifically his shooting and killing of Randy Weaver's wife while she held an infant child. McVeigh wrote hate mail to Horiuchi, suggesting that \"what goes around, comes around\". McVeigh later considered putting aside his plan to target the Murrah Building to target Horiuchi or a member of his family instead.\nMcVeigh became a fixture on the gun show circuit, traveling to forty states and visiting about eighty gun shows. He found that the further west he went, the more anti-government sentiment he encountered, at least until he got to what he called \"The People's Socialist Republic of California.\" McVeigh sold survival items and copies of \"The Turner Diaries\". One author said: &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;In the gun show culture, McVeigh found a home. Though he remained skeptical of some of the most extreme ideas being bandied around, he liked talking to people there about the United Nations, the federal government, and possible threats to American liberty.\nArizona with Fortier.\nMcVeigh had a road atlas with hand-drawn designations of the most likely places for nuclear attacks and considered buying property in Seligman, Arizona, which he determined to be in a \"nuclear-free zone.\" He lived with Michael Fortier in Kingman, Arizona, and the two became so close that he served as best man at Fortier's wedding. McVeigh experimented with cannabis and methamphetamine after first researching their effects in an encyclopedia. He was never as interested in drugs as Fortier was, and one of the reasons they parted ways was that McVeigh grew tired of Fortier's drug habits.\nWith Nichols, Waco siege, and radicalization.\nIn April 1993, McVeigh headed for a farm in Michigan where former roommate Terry Nichols lived. In between watching coverage of the Waco siege on TV, Nichols and his brother began teaching McVeigh how to make explosives by combining household chemicals in plastic jugs. The destruction of the Waco compound enraged McVeigh and convinced him that it was time to take action. He was particularly angered by the government's use of CS gas on women and children; he had been exposed to the gas as part of his military training and was familiar with its effects. The disappearance of certain evidence, such as the bullet-riddled steel-reinforced front door to the complex, led him to suspect a cover-up.\nMcVeigh's anti-government rhetoric became more radical. He began to sell Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) hats riddled with bullet holes, and a flare gun that he said could shoot down an \"ATF helicopter\". He produced videos detailing the government's actions at Waco and handed out pamphlets with titles such as \"U.S. Government Initiates Open Warfare Against American People\" and \"Waco Shootout Evokes Memory of Warsaw '43.\" He began changing his answering machine greeting every couple of weeks to various quotes by Patrick Henry, such as \"Give me liberty or give me death.\" He began experimenting with making pipe bombs and other small explosive devices. The government imposed new firearms restrictions in 1994 which McVeigh believed threatened his livelihood.\nMcVeigh dissociated himself from his boyhood friend Steve Hodge by sending him a 23-page farewell letter. He proclaimed his devotion to the United States Declaration of Independence, explaining in detail what each sentence meant to him. McVeigh declared that:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nMcVeigh felt the need to personally reconnoiter sites of rumored conspiracies. He visited Area 51 in order to defy government restrictions on photography and went to Gulfport, Mississippi, to determine the veracity of rumors about United Nations operations. These turned out to be false; the Russian vehicles on the site were being configured for use in U.N.-sponsored humanitarian aid efforts. Around this time, McVeigh and Nichols began making bulk purchases of ammonium nitrate, an agricultural fertilizer, for resale to survivalists, since rumors were circulating that the government was preparing to ban it.\nPlan against federal building or individuals.\nMcVeigh told Fortier of his plans to blow up a federal building, but Fortier declined to participate. Fortier also told his wife about the plans. McVeigh composed two letters to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, the first titled \"Constitutional Defenders\" and the second \"ATF Read.\" He denounced government officials as \"fascist tyrants\" and \"storm troopers,\" and warned: &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nMcVeigh also wrote a letter to recruit a customer named Steve Colbern:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;A man with nothing left to lose is a very dangerous man and his energy/anger can be focused toward a common/righteous goal. What I'm asking you to do, then, is sit back and be honest with yourself. Do you have kids/wife? Would you back out at the last minute to care for the family? Are you interested in keeping your firearms for their current/future monetary value, or would you drag that '06 through rock, swamp and cactus... to get off the needed shot? In short, I'm not looking for talkers, I'm looking for fighters... And if you are a fed, think twice. Think twice about the Constitution you are supposedly enforcing (isn't \"enforcing freedom\" an oxymoron?) and think twice about catching us with our guard down\u00a0\u2013 you will lose just like Degan did\u00a0\u2013 and your family will lose.\nMcVeigh began announcing that he had progressed from the \"propaganda\" phase to the \"action\" phase. He wrote to his Michigan friend Gwenda Strider, \"I have certain other 'militant' talents that are in short supply and greatly demanded.\"\nMcVeigh later said he considered \"a campaign of individual assassination,\" with \"eligible\" targets including Attorney General Janet Reno, Judge Walter S. Smith Jr. of Federal District Court, who handled the Branch Davidian trial; and Lon Horiuchi, a member of the FBI hostage-rescue team, who shot and killed Vicki Weaver in a standoff at a remote cabin at Ruby Ridge, Idaho, in 1992. He said he wanted Reno to accept \"full responsibility in deed, not just words.\" Such an assassination seemed too difficult, and he decided that since federal agents had become soldiers, he should strike at them at their command centers. According to McVeigh's authorized biography, he decided that he could make the loudest statement by bombing a federal building. After the bombing, he was ambivalent about his act and the deaths he caused; as he said in letters to his hometown newspaper, he sometimes wished that he had carried out a series of assassinations against police and government officials instead.\nOklahoma City bombing.\nWorking at a lakeside campground near McVeigh's old Army post, he and Nichols constructed an ANFO explosive device mounted in the back of a rented Ryder truck. The bomb consisted of about of ammonium nitrate and nitromethane.\nOn April 19, 1995, McVeigh drove the truck to the front of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building just as its offices opened for the day. Before arriving, he stopped to light a two-minute fuse. At 09:02, a large explosion destroyed the north half of the building. It killed 168 people, including 19 children in the day care center on the second floor, and injured 684 others.\nMcVeigh said that he had not known that there was a daycare center on the second floor, and that he might have chosen a different target if he had known about it. Nichols said that he and McVeigh did know about the daycare center in the building, and that they did not care.\nMcVeigh's biographers, Lou Michel and Dan Herbeck, spoke with McVeigh in interviews totaling 75 hours. He said about the victims:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;To these people in Oklahoma who have lost a loved one, I'm sorry but it happens every day. You're not the first mother to lose a kid, or the first grandparent to lose a grandson or a granddaughter. It happens every day, somewhere in the world. I'm not going to go into that courtroom, curl into a fetal ball and cry just because the victims want me to do that.\nDuring an interview in 2000 with Ed Bradley for television news magazine \"60 Minutes\", Bradley asked McVeigh for his reaction to the deaths of the nineteen children. McVeigh said: &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;I thought it was terrible that there were children in the building.\nAccording to the Oklahoma City Memorial Institute for the Prevention of Terrorism (MIPT), more than 300 buildings in the city were damaged. More than 12,000 volunteers and rescue workers took part in the rescue, recovery and support operations following the bombing. In reference to theories that McVeigh had assistance from others, he responded with a well-known line from the film \"A Few Good Men\", \"You can't handle the truth!\" He added, \"Because the truth is, I blew up the Murrah Building and isn't it kind of scary that one man could wreak this kind of hell?\"\nArrest and trial.\nBy tracing the vehicle identification number of a rear axle found in the wreckage, the FBI identified the vehicle as a Ryder rental box truck rented from Junction City, Kansas. Workers at the agency assisted an FBI artist in creating a sketch of the renter, who had used the alias \"Robert Kling\". The sketch was shown in the area. Lea McGown, manager of the local Dreamland Motel, identified the sketch as Timothy McVeigh.\nShortly after the bombing, while driving on Interstate\u00a035 in Noble County, near Perry, Oklahoma, McVeigh was stopped by State Trooper Charles J. Hanger. Hanger had passed McVeigh's yellow 1977 Mercury Marquis and noticed that it had no license plate. McVeigh admitted to the state trooper\u00a0\u2013 who noticed a bulge under his jacket\u00a0\u2013 that he had a gun; the trooper arrested him for driving without plates and possessing an illegal firearm. McVeigh's concealed weapon permit was not legal in Oklahoma. McVeigh was wearing a shirt at that time with a picture of Abraham Lincoln and the motto ('Thus always to tyrants'), the supposed words shouted by John Wilkes Booth after he shot Lincoln. On the back, it had a tree with a picture of three blood droplets and the Thomas Jefferson quote, \"The tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants.\" Three days later, McVeigh was identified as the subject of the nationwide manhunt.\nOn August 10, 1995, McVeigh was indicted on 11\u00a0federal counts, including conspiracy to use a weapon of mass destruction, use of a weapon of mass destruction, destruction with the use of explosives, and eight counts of first degree murder for the deaths of law enforcement officers. On February\u00a020, 1996, the Court granted a change of venue and ordered that the case be transferred from Oklahoma City to the District Court in Denver, to be presided over by District Judge Richard Paul Matsch.\nMcVeigh instructed his lawyers to use a necessity defense, but they ended up not doing so. They would have had to prove that McVeigh was in \"imminent danger\" from the government. McVeigh argued that \"imminent\" did not necessarily mean \"immediate\". They would have argued that his bombing of the Murrah building was a justifiable response to what McVeigh believed were the crimes of the U.S. government at Waco, Texas, where the 51-day siege of the Branch Davidian complex resulted in the deaths of 76\u00a0Branch Davidians. As part of the defense, McVeigh's lawyers showed the jury the controversial video \"Waco, the Big Lie\".\nOn June 2, 1997, McVeigh was found guilty on all 11\u00a0counts of the federal indictment. Although 168\u00a0people, including 19\u00a0children, were killed in the April\u00a019, 1995, bombing, murder charges were brought against McVeigh for only the eight federal agents who were on duty when the bomb destroyed much of the Murrah Building. Along with the eight counts of murder, McVeigh was charged with conspiracy to use a weapon of mass destruction, and destroying a federal building. Oklahoma City District Attorney Bob Macy said he would file state charges in the other 160\u00a0murders after McVeigh's co-defendant, Terry Nichols, was tried. After the verdict, McVeigh tried to calm his mother by saying, \"Think of it this way. When I was in the Army, you didn't see me for years. Think of me that way now, like I'm away in the Army again, on an assignment for the military.\"\nOn June 13, the jury recommended that McVeigh be sentenced to death. The U.S. Department of Justice brought federal charges against McVeigh for causing the deaths of eight federal officers leading to a possible death penalty for McVeigh; they could not bring charges against McVeigh for the remaining 160\u00a0deaths in federal court because those deaths fell under the jurisdiction of the State of Oklahoma. Because McVeigh was convicted and sentenced to death, the State of Oklahoma did not file murder charges against McVeigh for the other 160\u00a0deaths. Before the sentence was formally pronounced by Judge Matsch, McVeigh addressed the court for the first time and said: \"If the Court please, I wish to use the words of Justice [Louis] Brandeis dissenting in \"Olmstead [v. United States]\" to speak for me. He wrote, 'Our Government is the potent, the omnipresent teacher. For good or for ill, it teaches the whole people by its example.' That's all I have.\"\nMotivations for the bombing.\nMcVeigh claimed that the bombing was revenge against the government for the sieges at Waco and Ruby Ridge. McVeigh visited Waco during the standoff. While there, he was interviewed by student reporter Michelle Rauch, a senior journalism major at Southern Methodist University who was writing for the school paper. McVeigh expressed his objections over what was happening there.\nMcVeigh frequently quoted and alluded to the white supremacist novel \"The Turner Diaries\"; he claimed to appreciate its interest in firearms. Photocopies of pages sixty-one and sixty-two of \"The Turner Diaries\" were found in an envelope inside McVeigh's car. These pages depicted a fictitious mortar attack upon the U.S. Capitol in Washington.\nIn a 1,200-word essay dated March 1998, from the federal maximum-security prison at Florence, Colorado, McVeigh claimed that the terrorist bombing was \"morally equivalent\" to U.S. military actions against Iraq and other foreign countries. The handwritten essay, submitted to and published by the alternative national news magazine \"Media Bypass\", was distributed worldwide by the Associated Press on May 29, 1998. This was written in the midst of the 1998 Iraq disarmament crisis and a few months before Operation Desert Fox.\nOn April 26, 2001, McVeigh wrote a letter to Fox News, \"I Explain Herein Why I Bombed the Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City\", which explicitly laid out his reasons for the attack. McVeigh read the novel \"Unintended Consequences\" (1996), and said that if it had come out a few years earlier, he would have given serious consideration to using sniper attacks in a war of attrition against the government instead of bombing a federal building.\nAccomplices.\nMcVeigh's accomplice Terry Nichols was convicted and sentenced in federal court to life in prison for his role in the crime. At Nichols' trial, evidence was presented indicating that others may have been involved. Several residents of central Kansas, including real estate agent Georgia Rucker and a retired Army NCO, testified at Terry Nichols' federal trial that they had seen two trucks at Geary Lake State Park, where prosecutors alleged the bomb was assembled. The retired NCO said he visited the lake on April 18, 1995, but left after a group of surly men looked at him aggressively. The operator of the Dreamland Motel testified that two Ryder trucks had been parked outside her Grandview Plaza motel where McVeigh stayed in Room 26 the weekend before the bombing. Terry Nichols is incarcerated at ADX Florence in Florence, Colorado.\nMichael and Lori Fortier were also considered accomplices, due to their foreknowledge of the bombing. In addition to Michael assisting McVeigh in scouting the federal building, Lori had helped McVeigh laminate a fake driver's license which was used to rent the Ryder truck. Fortier agreed to testify against McVeigh and Nichols in exchange for a reduced sentence and immunity for his wife. He was sentenced on May 27, 1998, to twelve years in prison and fined $75,000 for failing to warn authorities about the bombing. On January 20, 2006, Fortier was released for good behavior into the Witness Protection Program and given a new identity.\nAn ATF informant, Carol Howe, told reporters that shortly before the bombing she had warned her handlers that guests of the private community of Elohim City, Oklahoma, were planning a major bombing attack. McVeigh was issued a speeding ticket there at the same time. Other than this speeding ticket, there is no evidence of a connection between McVeigh and members of the Midwest Bank Robbers at Elohim City.\nSome witnesses claimed to have seen a second suspect, and there was a search for a \"John Doe #2\", but none was ever found.\nIncarceration and execution.\nMcVeigh's death sentence was delayed pending an appeal. One of his appeals for , taken to the Supreme Court of the United States, was denied on March\u00a08, 1999. McVeigh's request for a nationally televised execution was also denied. Entertainment Network Inc., an Internet company that produces adult-themed websites, unsuccessfully sued for the right to broadcast the execution. At USP Florence ADMAX, McVeigh and Nichols were housed in what was known as \"bomber's row\". Ted Kaczynski, Luis Felipe, and Ramzi Yousef were also housed in this cell block. Yousef made frequent, unsuccessful attempts to convert McVeigh to Islam.\nThe day before his execution, McVeigh said in a letter to \"The Buffalo News\": \"I am sorry these people had to lose their lives, but that's the nature of the beast. It's understood going in what the human toll will be.\" An agnostic, he said that if there turned out to be an afterlife, he would \"improvise, adapt and overcome\", noting: \"If there is a hell, then I'll be in good company with a lot of fighter pilots who also had to bomb innocents to win the war.\" He also said: \"I knew I wanted this before it happened. I knew my objective was state-assisted suicide and when it happens, it's in your face. You just did something you're trying to say should be illegal for medical personnel.\"\nThe Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) transferred McVeigh from USP Florence ADMAX to the federal death row at USP Terre Haute in Terre Haute, Indiana, in 1999. McVeigh dropped his remaining appeals, saying that he would rather die than spend the rest of his life in prison. On January\u00a016, 2001, the BOP set May\u00a016 as McVeigh's execution date. McVeigh said that his only regret was not completely destroying the federal building. Six days prior to his scheduled execution, the FBI turned over thousands of documents of evidence it had previously withheld to McVeigh's attorneys. As a result, U.S. Attorney General John Ashcroft announced McVeigh's execution would be stayed for one month. The execution date was reset for June\u00a011. McVeigh also requested a Catholic chaplain. His last meal consisted of two pints of mint chocolate chip ice cream.\nMcVeigh chose William Ernest Henley's 1875 poem \"Invictus\" as his final written statement. Just before the execution, when he was asked if he had a final statement, he declined. Jay Sawyer, a relative of one of the victims, wrote, \"Without saying a word, he got the final word.\" Larry Whicher, whose brother died in the attack, described McVeigh as having \"a totally expressionless, blank stare. He had a look of defiance and that if he could, he'd do it all over again.\" McVeigh was executed by lethal injection at 7:14\u00a0a.m. on June\u00a011, 2001, the first person to be executed by the United States federal government since Victor Feguer was executed in Iowa on March\u00a015, 1963.\nOn November 21, 1997, President Bill Clinton had signed S.\u00a0923, special legislation introduced by Senator Arlen Specter to bar McVeigh and other veterans convicted of capital crimes from being buried in any military cemetery. His body was cremated at Mattox Ryan Funeral Home in Terre Haute. His ashes were given to his lawyer, who said \"the final destination of McVeigh's remains would remain privileged forever.\" McVeigh had written that he considered having them dropped at the site of the memorial where the building once stood, but decided that would be \"too vengeful, too raw, too cold.\" He had expressed willingness to donate organs, but was prohibited from doing so by prison regulations. Psychiatrist John Smith concluded that McVeigh was \"a decent person who had allowed rage to build up inside him to the point that he had lashed out in one terrible, violent act.\" McVeigh's IQ was assessed at 126.\nAssociations.\nAccording to CNN, his only known associations were as a registered Republican while in Buffalo, New York, in the 1980s, and a membership in the National Rifle Association while in the Army. \nAfter returning home from war he signed up for a trial membership in the KKK, although he did not ultimately continue with the Klan. There is no conclusive evidence that he ever belonged to any other extremist groups.\nReligious beliefs.\nMcVeigh was raised Roman Catholic. During his childhood, he and his father attended Mass regularly. McVeigh was confirmed at the Good Shepherd Church in Pendleton, New York, in 1985. In a 1996 interview, McVeigh professed belief in \"a God\", although he said he had \"sort of lost touch with\" Catholicism and \"I never really picked it up, however I do maintain core beliefs.\" In McVeigh's biography \"American Terrorist\", released in 2002, he stated that he did not believe in a hell and that science is his religion. In June 2001, a day before the execution, McVeigh wrote a letter to the \"Buffalo News\" identifying himself as agnostic. However, he took the last rites, administered by a priest, just before his execution. Father Charles Smith ministered to McVeigh in his last moments on death row.\nIn popular culture.\nIn the 2023 historical drama miniseries \"\", McVeigh is portrayed by Alex Breaux.\nIn 2024, HBO produced the documentary \"An American Bombing: The Road to April 19\".\nIn the 2024 film \"McVeigh\", he is played by Alfie Allen.\nReferences.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

All of them are radioactively unstable and decay into other elements. They are synthetic and none occur naturally on Earth, except for neptunium and plutonium which have been found in trace amounts in nature.\nOverview.\nOf the elements with atomic numbers 1 to 92, most can be found in nature, having stable isotopes (such as lead) or very long-lived radioisotopes (such as uranium), or existing as common decay products of the decay of uranium and thorium (such as radium). The exceptions are technetium, promethium, astatine, and francium; all four occur in nature, but only in very minor branches of the uranium and thorium decay chains, and thus all except francium were first discovered by synthesis in the laboratory rather than in nature.\nAll elements with higher atomic numbers have been first discovered in the laboratory, with neptunium and plutonium (the first two of these) later discovered in nature. They are all radioactive, with a half-life much shorter than the age of the Earth, so any primordial (i.e. present at the Earth's formation) atoms of these elements, have long since decayed. Trace amounts of neptunium and plutonium form in some uranium-rich rock, and small amounts are produced during atmospheric tests of nuclear weapons. These two elements are generated by neutron capture in uranium ore with subsequent beta decays (e.g. 238U + n \u2192 239U \u2192 239Np \u2192 239Pu).\nAll elements beyond plutonium are entirely synthetic, at least on Earth; they are created in nuclear reactors or particle accelerators. The half-lives of these elements show a general trend of decreasing as atomic numbers increase. There are exceptions, however, including several isotopes of curium and dubnium. Some heavier elements in this series, around atomic numbers 110\u2013114, are thought to break the trend and demonstrate increased nuclear stability, comprising the theoretical island of stability.\nTransuranic elements are difficult and expensive to produce, and their prices increase rapidly with atomic number. As of 2008, the cost of weapons-grade plutonium was around $4,000/gram, and californium exceeded $60,000,000/gram. Einsteinium is the heaviest element that has been produced in macroscopic quantities.\nTransuranic elements that have not been discovered, or have been discovered but are not yet officially named, use IUPAC's systematic element names. The naming of transuranic elements may be a source of controversy.\nDiscoveries.\nSo far, essentially all transuranium elements have been discovered at four laboratories: Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL) in the United States (elements 93\u2013101, 106, and joint credit for 103\u2013105), the GSI Helmholtz Centre for Heavy Ion Research in Germany (elements 107\u2013112), RIKEN in Japan (element 113), and the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research (JINR) in Russia (elements 102 and 114\u2013118, and joint credit for 103\u2013105).\nSuperheavy elements.\nSuperheavy elementsin the periodic table\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Periodic table (32 columns, micro)/styles.css\"/&gt;\n\"Z\"\u00a0&gt;\u00a0103 (Lr)\nSuperheavy elements, (also known as \"superheavies\", or \"superheavy atoms\", commonly abbreviated SHE) usually refer to the transactinide elements beginning with rutherfordium (atomic number 104). (Lawrencium, the first 6d element, is sometimes but not always included as well.) They have only been made artificially and currently serve no practical purpose because their short half-lives cause them to decay after a very short time, ranging from a few hours to just milliseconds, which also makes them extremely hard to study.\nSuperheavies have all been created since the latter half of the 20th century and are continually being created during the 21st century as technology advances. They are created through the bombardment of elements in a particle accelerator, in quantities on the atomic scale, and no method of mass creation has been found.\nApplications.\nTransuranic elements may be used to synthesize superheavy elements. Elements of the island of stability have potentially important military applications, including the development of compact nuclear weapons. The potential everyday applications are vast; americium is used in devices such as smoke detectors and spectrometers.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "31539", "revid": "37005538", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31539", "title": "The Replacements (band)", "text": "American rock band (1979\u20132015)\nThe Replacements were an American rock band formed in Minneapolis, Minnesota, in 1979. The band was composed of the guitarist and vocalist Paul Westerberg, guitarist Bob Stinson, bass guitarist Tommy Stinson, and drummer Chris Mars for most of its existence. After two albums in the style of punk rock, they became one of the main pioneers of alternative rock with their acclaimed albums \"Let It Be\" and \"Tim\". Bob Stinson was kicked out of the band in 1986, and Slim Dunlap joined as lead guitarist. Steve Foley replaced Mars in 1990. Towards the end of the band's career, Westerberg exerted more control over its creative output. The group disbanded in 1991 and the members found various projects. A reunion was announced on October 3, 2012. Fans affectionately refer to the band as the 'Mats, a nickname which originated as a truncation of \"The Placemats\".\nThe Replacements' music was influenced by rock artists such as the Rolling Stones, the Beatles, Faces, Big Star, Slade, Badfinger, Creedence Clearwater Revival, and Bob Dylan as well as punk rock bands including the Ramones, the New York Dolls, the Buzzcocks, the Damned and the Sex Pistols. Unlike many of their underground contemporaries, the Replacements played \"heart-on-the-sleeve\" rock songs which combined Westerberg's \"raw-throated adolescent howl\" with self-deprecating lyrics. The Replacements were a notoriously wayward live act, often performing under the influence of alcohol and playing fragments of covers instead of their own material.\nHistory.\nFormation and early years (1978\u20131980).\nThe Replacements' history began in Minneapolis in 1978, when nineteen-year-old Bob Stinson gave his eleven-year-old brother Tommy Stinson a bass guitar to keep him off the streets. In the same year, Bob met Mars, a high school dropout. With Mars playing guitar and then switching to drums, the trio called themselves \"Dogbreath\" and began covering songs by Aerosmith, Ted Nugent and Yes without a singer. One day as Westerberg, who was a janitor in U.S. Senator David Durenberger's office, was walking home from work he heard a band playing in the Stinsons' house. After being impressed by the band's performance, Westerberg regularly listened in after work. Mars knew Westerberg and invited him over to jam. Westerberg was unaware Mars was a drummer in Dogbreath.\nDogbreath auditioned several vocalists, including a hippie who read lyrics off a sheet. The band eventually found a vocalist, but Westerberg wanted to be the singer and took him aside one day to say, \"The band doesn't like you.\" The vocalist left and Westerberg replaced him. Before Westerberg joined the band, Dogbreath often drank and took various drugs during rehearsals, playing songs as an afterthought. In contrast to the rest of the band, the relatively disciplined Westerberg appeared at rehearsals in neat clothes and insisted on practicing songs until he was happy with them.\n\"They didn't even know what punk was. They didn't like punk. Chris had hair down to his shoulders,\" Westerberg told an interviewer. But after the band members discovered first-generation punk bands like The Clash, The Jam, The Damned, and The Buzzcocks, Dogbreath changed its name to the Impediments and played a drunken performance without Tommy Stinson at a church hall gig in June 1980. After being banned from the venue for disorderly behavior, they changed the name to the Replacements. In an unpublished memoir, Mars later explained the band's choice of name: \"Like maybe the main act doesn't show, and instead the crowd has to settle for an earful of us dirtbags... It seemed to sit just right with us, accurately describing our collective 'secondary' social esteem\".\nDemo tape and Twin/Tone Records (1980\u20131981).\nThe band recorded a four-song demo tape in Mars's basement; Westerberg handed it to Peter Jesperson in May 1980. Jesperson was the manager of Oar Folkjokeopus, a punk rock record store in Minneapolis; he also founded Twin/Tone Records with Paul Stark (a local recording engineer) and Charley Hallman. Westerberg originally handed in the tape to see if the band could perform at Jay's Longhorn Bar, a local venue where Jesperson worked as a disc jockey. The band's first performance at a bar was at the Longhorn on July 2, 1980. He eavesdropped while Jesperson put the tape on, only to run away as soon as the first song, \"Raised in the City\", played. Jesperson played the song again and again. \"If I've ever had a magic moment in my life, it was popping that tape in\", said Jesperson. \"I didn't even get through the first song before I thought my head was going to explode\".\nJesperson called Westerberg the next day, asking, \"So do you want to do a single or an album?\" With the agreement of Stark and the rest of the band, the Replacements signed with Twin/Tone Records in 1980. Jesperson's support of the band was welcomed and they asked him to be their manager after their second show. Later in the summer they played at the Longhorn on a Wednesday \"New Band Night\".\nThey played several club gigs to almost empty rooms. When they finished a song, apart from the low hum of conversation, the band would hear Jesperson's loud whistle and fast clapping. \"His enthusiasm kept us going at times, definitely,\" Mars later said. \"His vision, his faith in the band was a binding force.\" After the Replacements signed with Twin/Tone, Westerberg began to write songs and had an album's worth of material. Weeks after their live debut, the band felt ready to record the album. Jesperson chose Blackberry Way, an eight-track home studio in Minneapolis. However, as the band had no clout there, time spent in the studio was intermittent, and it took about six months to record the album. Although not important at the time, Twin/Tone could not afford to release the album until August 1981. Because they were suspicious of the music business in general, the Replacements had not signed a written contract with Twin/Tone Records. Before settling on a title for the band's debut album, Westerberg considered the names \"Unsuitable for Airplay\" and \"Power Trash.\"\nEarly releases (1981\u20131982).\nWhen the band's first album, \"Sorry Ma, Forgot to Take Out the Trash\", was released in August 1981, it received positive reviews in local fanzines. \"Option\"'s Blake Gumprecht wrote, \"Westerberg has the ability to make you feel like you're right in the car with him, alongside him at the door, drinking from the same bottle.\" The album contained the band's first single, \"I'm in Trouble\", Westerberg's \"first truly good song\". \"Sorry Ma\" included the song \"Somethin to D\u00fc\", a homage to another Twin Cities punk band, H\u00fcsker D\u00fc. The Replacements had a friendly rivalry with the band, which began when Twin/Tone chose the Replacements over H\u00fcsker D\u00fc.\nH\u00fcsker D\u00fc landed an opening slot at a Johnny Thunders gig that the Replacements had wanted. H\u00fcsker D\u00fc also influenced the band's music, and the Replacements began playing faster and becoming more influenced by hardcore punk. Despite that the band did not feel part of the hardcore scene. As Mars later said, \"We were confused about what we were.\" Sometime in late 1981, the Replacements played a song called \"Kids Don't Follow\". Jesperson was convinced the song sounded like a hit and pleaded with the Twin/Tone co-owners Stark and Hallman, \"I will do anything to get this out. I will hand-stamp jackets if I have to.\" The partners agreed to fund the recording, but Jesperson and virtually everyone he knew had to hand-stamp ten thousand white record jackets. The band recorded eight tracks within a week, with Jesperson as producer. Their \"balls-to-the-wall hardcore punk attempt\", their first EP \"Stink\", containing \"Kids Don't Follow\" and seven other songs, was released in June 1982, six months after a show in Chicago.\nThe Replacements began to distance themselves from the hardcore punk scene after the release of \"Stink\". \"We write songs rather than riffs with statements,\" Westerberg later stated. Inspired by other rock subgenres, he had been writing songs that incorporated a wide range of musical styles. He even wrote an acoustic ballad, \"You're Getting Married One Night\", but when he played it to the rest of the band, it was met with silence. \"Save that for your solo album, Paul,\" Bob Stinson said. \"That ain't the Replacements\". The track remained unreleased for years. Westerberg realized his toughest audience was the band itself, later saying, \"If it doesn't rock enough, Bob will scoff at it, and if it isn't catchy enough, Chris won't like it, and if it isn't modern enough, Tommy won't like it.\"\n\"Hootenanny\" and \"Let It Be\" (1983\u20131984).\nWith some new songs, the Replacements entered a warehouse in Roseville, Minnesota to record their next album; Twin/Tone co-owner Stark engineered. Westerberg wrote songs in stops and starts, so it took several sessions of recording to finish the album. Stark's meticulous approach to recording contrasted with that of the Replacements, often frustrating the band. In one session, Mars and Westerberg switched instruments and the band began to improvise, with Westerberg repeatedly shouting, \"It's a hootenanny.\" The band declared it to be \"side one, track one\" of the new album. According to Stark, the recording \"was a complete joke from their point of view\u2014they did not care what they delivered\".\n\"Hootenanny\", the band's second studio album, was released in April 1983. On \"Hootenanny\" Westerberg expanded his songwriting capabilities, in songs such as \"Willpower\", with echoed vocals and a sparse arrangement, and \"Within Your Reach\", which features Westerberg on all instruments, he revealed a more sensitive side. It was a more mature album than \"Stink\" and \"Sorry Ma, Forgot to Take Out the Trash\". \"Hootenanny\" was played on over two hundred radio stations across the country, with critics giving the album acclaim. Robert Christgau, writing in the \"Village Voice\", deemed it to be \"the most critically independent album of 1983\".\nWith \"Hootenanny\"'s release, the Replacements had begun to attract a following outside of Minneapolis. The band embarked on its first tour of the United States in April 1983, joined by Bill Sullivan, a young security guard, as roadie, who approached the band after a show at the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis. Tommy Stinson dropped out of the tenth grade, joining the rest of the band on tour. The Replacements toured venues on the East Coast, including a tense gig at City Gardens, in Trenton, New Jersey where numerous punks lined the edge of the stage as the band played. The band performed in Detroit, Cleveland, and Philadelphia but its intended destination was New York City, where they played at Gerde's Folk City; they also performed at Maxwell's, in Hoboken, New Jersey.\nThe Replacements returned to New York in June 1983, playing at CBGB. The gig was a failure; the band were almost refused entry. Bob Stinson was thrown out as soon as he walked in the door, and the Replacements were the last of five bands, which meant they played in the early morning on a Monday night. The show at Folk City was not a success, because \"The Replacements were so loud and obnoxious that the people just cleared right out,\" according to manager Jesperson. The band supported R.E.M. on an eight-date tour later that summer, deciding that they should alienate the audience as much as possible. It was not a successful tour; by the end, various members had threatened to leave the Replacements. Band morale was low and Westerberg later said, \"We'd much rather play for fifty people who know us than a thousand who don't care.\"\nFor the recording of their next studio album, the Replacements decided to return to Blackberry Way Studios in late 1983. The band considered R.E.M.'s guitarist Peter Buck as producer, but when they met him in Athens, Georgia, they did not have enough material to begin recording. Instead, Jesperson and Steve Fjelstad co-produced the album. By that time, the Replacements had grown tired of playing loud and fast exclusively; Westerberg said, \"Now we're softening a little where we can do something that's a little more sincere without being afraid that someone's not going to like it or the punks aren't going to be able to dance to it.\"\nThe new material placed more of a focus on songwriting, and the music was influenced by heavy metal, arena rock and Chicago blues. Instruments such as piano, twelve-string guitar and mandolin were featured throughout the album. The new album included songs such as \"I Will Dare\", which featured Buck playing lead guitar; \"Androgynous\", with Westerberg on piano; and \"Unsatisfied\" in which, according to writer Michael Azerrad, Westerberg \"had hit upon a moving new way to declare that he can't get no satisfaction.\" The band's album \"Let It Be\" was released in October 1984 to critical acclaim. Robert Christgau gave the album an A+, and the \"Seattle Rocket\" critic Bruce Pavitt called \"Let It Be\" \"mature diverse rock that could well shoot these regional boys into the national mainstream\". In 1989, \"Let It Be\" was ranked number 12 on \"Spin\" magazine's list of the \"25 Greatest Albums of All Time\" and number 15 on \"Rolling Stone\" magazine's list of the \"100 Greatest Albums of the 1980s\".\nEarly major-label releases (1985\u20131988).\n\"Let It Be\" attracted the attention of major record labels, and by late 1984 several had expressed an interest in signing the Replacements. Financially, the band was not doing well; they were not selling enough records to recoup their expenses, and money from shows went to recording costs, hotels, travel, food and instrument repairs. Bob Stinson worked a day job as a pizza chef. Twin/Tone was not being paid reliably by distributors, and the sales of \"Let It Be\" were not high enough to justify extra promotion. \"It was time for a major label to take over,\" according to the label's co-owner Stark. The band was close to a major-label contract but often alienated label representatives by intentionally performing badly in concert; their 1985 live album, \"The Shit Hits the Fans\", was an example of their concert performances at the time.\nOne label, the Warner Bros. Records subsidiary Sire Records, eventually signed the Replacements. The band admired the label head, Seymour Stein, who had managed the Ramones, and Stein recruited Tommy Ramone as producer for their first major-label album, \"Tim\", released by Sire in October 1985.\nFor the rest of 1985 and the first half of 1986 the band toured behind \"Tim\". In mid-January 1986 the Replacements received a last-minute request to appear as the musical guests on the January 18 episode of \"Saturday Night Live\", replacing the scheduled act, The Pointer Sisters, who had been forced to cancel only days before the show. The invitation was partly thanks to the show's musical director of the time, G.E. Smith, who was a Replacements fan. However, as a result of their shambolic and profanity-laced performance during the late-night live broadcast, \"SNL\" producer Lorne Michaels banned them from ever returning to the show (although Westerberg returned as a solo artist in 1993, and was even allowed to play a Replacements song.)\nAfter playing an out-of-tune \"Bastards of Young\" (during which Westerberg audibly called out \"Come on fucker\" just off-mic) the band returned to stage wearing mismatched iterations of each other's clothing and performed \"Kiss Me on the Bus\" while completely intoxicated. In a 2015 interview recorded for the Archive of American Television, G. E. Smith recalled that although the band had performed well for the early evening taped dress rehearsal performance, one of the band's crew then smuggled alcohol into their dressing room and they spent the next few hours drinking (with the guest host, Harry Dean Stanton) and taking drugs. According to Smith, by the time of the late-night live broadcast they were so intoxicated that on their way to the stage to perform, Bob Stinson tripped in the corridor, fell over onto his guitar and broke it, and Smith had to hurriedly loan him one of the \"SNL\" house band's spare instruments.\nA few weeks later, on February 4, 1986, the band returned to the New York City area to perform at Maxwell's in Hoboken, New Jersey. The show was professionally recorded by a crew hired by the band's label Sire Records, for use in a possible live album. Over 30 years later, the recordings were released as the double album \"\". The tour ended abruptly in June 1986 because Westerberg injured his finger during a show at The Ritz in New York City.\nIn August 1986, the Replacements either fired Bob Stinson from the band which he had founded, or he chose to leave, or a little of both. In any case, it was due to creative and personal differences between Stinson and the remainder of the band, aggravated by Stinson's alcohol and drug abuse issues. They also fired Jesperson the same year. \"It was like being thrown out of a club that you helped start,\" Jesperson later commented. \"Everybody was drinking and doing more drugs than they needed to.\"\nStinson preferred the louder, faster style of the band's early music, while Westerberg was exploring new territory in ballads like \"Here Comes a Regular\" and \"Swingin' Party\". The remaining Replacements carried on as a trio for \"Pleased to Meet Me\" (1987), recorded in Memphis with Big Star producer Jim Dickinson. Minneapolis guitarist Slim Dunlap took over on lead guitar for the subsequent tour and soon became a full member of the band.\n\"Don't Tell a Soul\" and \"All Shook Down\" (1989\u20131990).\nThe band's next album, \"Don't Tell a Soul\", was a quieter, less punky affair, largely considered an attempt at mainstream success. While the move cost the Replacements the appreciation of some hardcore fans, the album had some notable songs, such as \"Achin' to Be\" and \"I'll Be You\", the latter of which topped the \"Billboard\" Modern Rock chart. The band then made a second appearance on network television, on the short-lived ABC program \"International Rock Awards\", for which they performed a typically energetic version of \"Talent Show\" and caused a minor controversy when Westerberg responded to the network's censoring of the \"feeling good from the pills we took\" line by inserting an uncensored \"It's too late to take pills, here we go\" at the end of the song. The band appeared on the cover of \"Musician\" magazine in February 1989, in which it was described as \"the last, best band of the 80s\".\nTrouble in the band began following a disastrous tour opening for Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers. Westerberg recorded a new album largely with session musicians but was persuaded to release it as a Replacements album. \"All Shook Down\" won critical praise and more mainstream attention and its debut single \"Merry Go Round\" again topped the Modern Rock charts. However, the album's many guest players and Mars' quick departure from the band following the album's release led many to wonder about the band's future. They also received a nomination for a Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Album.\nBreakup (1991\u20132011).\nSteve Foley was recruited as Mars's replacement in 1990, and the band toured with Elvis Costello in June 1991, the final show being at Madison Square Garden. The band embarked on a long farewell tour which lasted into the summer of 1991. On July 4, 1991, the band played their last show for 22 years, with the Chicago power-pop trio Material Issue at Taste of Chicago in Grant Park, referred to by fans as \"It Ain't Over 'Til the Fat Roadie Plays\", because each member disappeared during the set, their respective roadies taking their places. This show was broadcast live by the Chicago radio station WXRT. Several bootlegs are available on the Internet.\nAfter leaving the Replacements in 1986, Bob Stinson played in local Minneapolis bands such as Static Taxi and the Bleeding Hearts. After several years of drug and alcohol abuse, he died in 1995, at the age of 35. Tommy Stinson quickly followed his time in the Replacements with the short-lived bands Bash &amp; Pop and Perfect. He was the bass guitarist for Guns N' Roses beginning in 1998, replacing Duff McKagan from the band's \"classic lineup\" until leaving the band in 2016. In 2004, he released a solo CD, \"Village Gorilla Head\", followed in 2011 by \"One Man Mutiny\".\nWesterberg is a successful singer-songwriter signed to Vagrant Records and, under his alias Grandpaboy, to Fat Possum Records. His album \"Folker\" was released in September 2004, marking a return to the melodic low-fi of the Replacements. Dunlap kept a low national profile but remained active in the Twin Cities music scene until suffering a massive stroke in 2012, which left him without the ability to move or eat. He died in 2024. Mars primarily works as a visual artist.\nIn 1997, Reprise Records released the two CD set \"All for Nothing / Nothing for All\". The \"All for Nothing\" disc collected cuts from \"Tim\" through \"All Shook Down\"; the \"Nothing for All\" disc is a collection of B-sides and tracks not previously released on albums.\nIn 2002, in an interview with \"Rolling Stone\", Westerberg mentioned that the Replacements had been considering a reunion. He said, \"We'll get together again one day. It will take a while, or it might take a few legal swipes of the pen, but we ain't over.\" A partial reunion nearly occurred in March 2002, when Tommy Stinson planned to join Westerberg on a tour of the Midwest, but Stinson's prior commitments with Guns N' Roses prevented it from happening.\nIn 2004, active members of the band performed as the fictional Christian Rock group, Godflight, in Brian Dannelly's cult classic satirical black comedy, Saved!, starring Jena Malone, Mandy Moore, Eva Amurri, and Macaulay Culkin.\nOn June 13, 2006, Rhino Records released the compilation album \"Don't You Know Who I Think I Was?\", consisting of songs from the Twin/Tone and Sire-Reprise years and including two new songs, \"Pool &amp; Dive\" and \"Message to the Boys\". The new songs were written by Westerberg and recorded by the band (Westerberg, Tommy Stinson, and Mars) at Flowers Studio in Minneapolis. Session musician Josh Freese (the Vandals, ex-A Perfect Circle, and ex-Guns N' Roses) played drums on the two tracks; Mars contributed backing vocals. Neither Slim Dunlap nor Steve Foley participated in the sessions.\nOn April 22, 2008, Rhino released remastered deluxe editions of the band's four Twin/Tone albums with rare bonus tracks. On September 24, 2008, Rhino similarly released the four Sire albums in deluxe editions. Material recorded with Tom Waits in 1988 was released on the Westerberg solo album \"3oclockreep\" in 2008.\nFoley died in 2008 from an accidental overdose of a prescription medication.\nReunion (2012\u20132015).\nOn October 3, 2012, it was announced that the Replacements had re-formed and that Westerberg and Tommy Stinson were in the studio recording an EP containing song cover versions. Titled \"Songs for Slim\", the EP was sold in a 250-copy edition of 10\" vinyl and auctioned online to benefit former bandmate Dunlap, who had suffered a stroke.\nIn November 2012, the documentary filmmaker Gorman Bechard released \"Color Me Obsessed\", a film which tells the band's story through the eyes of their most ardent fans.\nThe Replacements played their first shows in 22 years at Riot Fest in Toronto (August 24 and 25, 2013), Chicago (September 13\u201315) and Denver (September 21 and 22). Dave Minehan, guitarist and vocalist of the Boston-based band the Neighborhoods as well as drummer Josh Freese rounded out the lineup for the shows.\nWesterberg said that the band has not ruled out touring or recording a new album. The band played two sets at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival, on April 11 and 18, 2014; Green Day front man Billie Joe Armstrong joined the band onstage on the second date. The band was also announced as one of the headliners of the September 2014 Boston Calling Music Festival, along with Lorde and the National. On September 9, 2014, the Replacements appeared as the musical guest on \"The Tonight Show\", performing \"Alex Chilton\". On September 19, 2014, they played at Forest Hills Stadium. Monsoon rains cancelled the Summer Ends Music Festival in Tempe, Arizona, on September 27, 2014, resulting in their only indoor show of the tour when it was moved to the Marquee Theatre.\nOn December 17, 2014, a 24-minute jazz improvisation track entitled \"Poke Me in My Cage\" was uploaded to the band's SoundCloud account.\nOn February 9, 2015, the band announced a spring tour of the United States. On this tour, they debuted a new song called \"Whole Foods Blues\", and according to their co-manager Darren Hill, the band has \"laid down seven or eight\" for a possible new album. Towards the end of the tour, two shows in Columbus, Ohio and Pittsburgh were initially postponed for medical reasons, but were later canceled. The Replacements performed for the first time in Spain and Portugal at the Primavera Sound festival on May 28, 2015, and June 5, 2015, respectively as part of a brief European tour. On June 5, 2015, Westerberg announced onstage at the Primavera Sound festival in Porto, Portugal, that it was the band's final show. T-shirts Westerberg had worn to previous shows had hinted at this outcome: each shirt had two letters on it (one each on front and back) spelling out, \"I have always loved you. Now I must whore my past.\"\nIn a September 2015 interview, Stinson discussed the band working on new studio material, stating, \"it was one of those things: We dipped our toe in the water, and it didn't feel so good.\" Stinson said that he had reworked songs he wrote for the Replacements as material for his solo career.\nLive performances.\nThe Replacements gained local notoriety following their first live performance because of Tommy Stinson's young age. Early shows were consistently tight and became more aggressive following the release of the \"Stink\" EP in 1982. As their stylistic repertoire began to expand with the writing and recording of \"Hootenanny\" the following year, the band's increasingly antagonistic stage show left them with a reputation for their rowdy, often drunken live shows. The band frequently went on stage too intoxicated to play. They were famously permanently banned from \"Saturday Night Live\" after Westerberg shouted a (mostly) off-microphone profanity, directed at guitarist Bob Stinson, before a national television audience on January 18, 1986.\nAs a reviewer succinctly observed, the band could quite often be \"mouthing profanities into the camera, stumbling into each other, falling down, dropping their instruments, and generally behaving like the apathetic drunks they were.\" There emerged an element of unpredictability, as the Replacements\u2014when sober\u2014gained critical praise for their live shows. Part of the mystique of the Replacements was the fact that the audience never knew until the start of a concert if the band would be too drunk to play. It was not uncommon for the group to play entire sets of cover versions, ranging anywhere from Bryan Adams's \"Summer of '69\" to Dusty Springfield's \"The Look of Love\" to Led Zeppelin's \"Black Dog\".\nLegacy.\nThe band has been honored with a star on the outside mural of the Minneapolis nightclub First Avenue, recognizing performers that have played sold-out shows or have otherwise demonstrated a major contribution to the culture at the iconic venue. Receiving a star \"might be the most prestigious public honor an artist can receive in Minneapolis,\" according to journalist Steve Marsh. Westerberg also has a star for his solo work; he is one of the few musicians to be honored with multiple stars on the mural.\nThe Goo Goo Dolls' vocalist and guitarist Johnny Rzeznik cites Paul Westerberg as an \"obvious influence\" on his music. The Goo Goo Dolls toured in support for the Replacements' final tour. They also co-wrote the song \"We Are the Normal\" with Westerberg for their 1993 album \"Superstar Car Wash\". Members of the Cribs have cited the Replacements as a key influence. Members of the alternative country groups Uncle Tupelo and Whiskeytown have said that the Replacements were an important influence on them. Brian Fallon of Gaslight Anthem said in a 2009 interview that \"without the Replacements, there would be no Gaslight Anthem\" and that they were inspired by the song \"Left of the Dial\". The band They Might Be Giants made a tribute song to them called \"We're The Replacements\".\n1234 Go! Records released \"We'll Inherit the Earth: A Tribute to The Replacements\" on October 3, 2006. The album contains twenty-three covers of the Replacements songs by various rock, punk, pop and country artists.\nOn October 16, 2013, the band was announced as one of the 2014 Rock and Roll Hall of Fame nominees, but they were not inducted. \"Alex Chilton\" appears as a playable song in Harmonix's music videogame \"Rock Band 2\" for all consoles. \"Kids Don't Follow\" was also released for the game as downloadable content.\nIndie rock band Art Brut released a song titled \"The Replacements\" on their third album (Art Brut vs. Satan), in which singer Eddie Argos expresses both appreciation for the band, and incredulousness over the fact he was not already familiar with their music.\nTheir songs have been used in many feature films. \"Treatment Bound\" was used in the official soundtrack for \"Jackass Number Two\". The 1998 teen comedy film \"Can't Hardly Wait\" is named after their single, and the song itself plays over the end credits. The song \"I Will Dare\" is sung by Keanu Reeves and Cameron Diaz in the car in \"Feeling Minnesota\". Lou and Nick contemplate their lives and the possibility of changing the past in the 2010 comedy \"Hot Tub Time Machine\" while \"I Will Dare\" plays in the background.\n\"I'll Be You\" plays during Jerry's bachelor party in the 1996 romantic comedy-drama sports film \"Jerry Maguire\". The 2009 Greg Mottola film, \"Adventureland\", opens with \"Bastards of Young\". The song \"Unsatisfied\" is used in the film during the bus ride to New York. The song was also featured in the 1994 film \"Airheads\" and the 2016 film \"Ordinary World\". The fictional band the Fingers, in the movie \"Losers Take All\", gets their big break by securing a gig opening for the Replacements. \"Within Your Reach\" was used in the 1989 film \"Say Anything\". \"Here Comes a Regular\" was on the episode \"Rigby's Graduation Day Special\" on Cartoon Network's \"Regular Show\". \"Here Comes a Regular\" was on the episode \"The Wind That Blew My Heart Away\" on \"One Tree Hill\". Peyton's mother describes the song as \"the happiest\" and it is heard playing in the episode. \"Here Comes a Regular\" also appeared in the final episode of the Netflix series \"13 Reasons Why\".\nIn what could be considered the only case of the Replacements receiving any official recording industry accolades, the band's biographer Bob Mehr received the Best Album Notes trophy at the 63rd Annual Grammy Awards in 2021 for his liner notes on the 2019 box set \"Dead Man's Pop\", which is itself an anniversary reissue of their 1989 album \"Don't Tell a Soul\".\nIn 2023, Tommy Stinson said:\nPart of our lure is that we stayed underground. We stayed underground, for the most part, because of our shortcomings[...] But that was also, somehow, our strong-suit\u2014that we were so unable to conform to what would make us star-quality or what would catapult us. We always felt like the music had to do it, that we couldn't do something with the music to make us more popular. In saying that, there were a lot of opportunities that I think we probably pissed away\u2014because we just didn't know how to greet them artistically and make them fun or make them palatable. We pretty much wung [sic] our entire career. From top to bottom, we were total defects and we didn't know any better. All that you hear is exactly the way we were. It's the good, the bad and the ugly, really.\nMembers.\nTouring musicians\nTimeline\nReferences.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

There are no formal criteria, but twin cities are generally comparable in status and size, though not necessarily equal; a city and a substantially smaller suburb would not typically qualify, even if they were once separate. Tri-cities and quad cities are similar groups of three or four municipalities.\nA common \u2013 but not universal \u2013 scenario is two cities that developed concurrently on opposite sides of a river. For example, Minneapolis and Saint Paul in Minnesota \u2013 one of the most widely known pairs of \"Twin Cities\" \u2013 were founded several miles apart on opposite sides of the Mississippi River, and competed for prominence as they grew.\nIn some cases, twin cities are separated by a state border, such as Albury (New South Wales) and Wodonga (Victoria) in Australia, on opposite sides of the Murray River. In Pakistan, Islamabad and Rawalpindi are twin cities located in northwestern Punjab region: Islamabad is administratively being part of the Islamabad Capital Territory, and Rawalpindi is in the province of Punjab. Cities on opposite sides of international borders sometimes share enough cultural and historical identity to be seen as twins, such as Haparanda (Sweden) and Tornio (Finland), Leticia (Colombia) and Tabatinga (Brazil), or Valga (Estonia) and Valka (Latvia).\nIn some cases twin cities eventually merge into a single legal municipality, such as Buda and Pest merging in 1873 into Budapest, Hungary; Brooklyn and New York City being consolidated in 1898; and the three ancient cities of Hankou, Hanyang, and Wuchang joining in 1927 into Wuhan.\nAs a single urban area, twin cities may share an airport whose airport codes include both cities' initials, e.g. DFW (Dallas\u2013Fort Worth), LBA (Leeds\u2013Bradford), MSP (Minneapolis\u2013Saint Paul), RDU (Raleigh and Durham), and CAK (Akron\u2013Canton).\nTwin cities.\nList of International border towns and cities.\nEurope.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nChina\n* Wuhan in China consists of the towns of Wuchang, Hankou, and Hanyang in Hubei Province.\nIndia\n* Delhi: What used to be Old Delhi, New Delhi, and a collection of smaller villages has now grown into the current megalopolis that is seen today, also known as the National Capital Region (NCR)\n* In Telangana, the cities of Hyderabad and Secunderabad are merged to form Greater Hyderabad.\nJapan\n* Fukuoka in Japan, a city of 1.4 million people, formerly the twin cities of Hakata and Fukuoka until the late 19th century.\n* Kitakyushu in Japan, a city of 900,000 people, created in 1963 by the merger of Yahata, Kokura, Moji, Wakamatsu, and Tobata.

It is named for the Tyrrhenian people identified with the Etruscans of Italy.\nGeography.\nThe sea is bounded by the islands of Corsica and Sardinia (to the west), the Italian Peninsula (regions of Tuscany, Lazio, Campania, Basilicata, and Calabria) to the north and east, and the island of Sicily (to the south). The Tyrrhenian Sea also includes a number of smaller islands like Capri, Elba, Ischia, and Ustica.\nThe maximum depth of the sea is .\nThe Tyrrhenian Sea is situated near where the African and Eurasian Plates meet; therefore mountain chains and active volcanoes, such as Mount Marsili, are found in its depths. The eight Aeolian Islands and Ustica are located in the southern part of the sea, north of Sicily.\nCaprera Canyon.\nWithin The Tyrrhenian Sea at a depth of 1,000 metres (3,281\u00a0ft) is a geographical location known as the Caprera Canyon. An exploration conducted by The One Ocean Foundation revealed colonies of rare sponges, corals and numerous fish species, many of them being endangered or at risk. The biology of the canyon is currently at risk as of November 17, 2025. This is due to an increase in travel based pollution and Bottom Trawling. The One Ocean Foundation is currently pursuing multiple layers of protection that are currently not provided for this area.\nExtent.\nThe International Hydrographic Organization defines the limits of the Tyrrhenian Sea as follows:\nExits.\nThere are four exits from the Tyrrhenian Sea (north to south):\nBasins.\nThe Tyrrhenian Basin is divided into two basins (or plains), the Vavilov plain and the Marsili plain. They are separated by the undersea ridge known as the Issel Bridge, after Arturo Issel.\nGeology.\nThe Tyrrhenian Sea is a back-arc basin that formed due to the rollback of the Calabrian slab towards South-East during the Neogene. Episodes of fast and slow trench retreat formed first the Vavilov basin and, then, the Marsili basin. Submarine volcanoes and the active volcano Mount Stromboli formed because trench retreat produces extension in the overriding plate allowing the mantle to rise below the surface and partially melt. The magmatism here is also affected by the fluids released from the slab.\nName.\nIts name derives from the Greek name for the Etruscans, first mentioned by Hesiod in the 8th century BC who described them as residing in central Italy alongside the Latins. The Etruscans lived along the coast of modern Tuscany, Latium and Campania, and referred to the water as the \"Sea of the Etruscans\".\nIslands.\nIslands of the Tyrrhenian Sea include:\nPorts.\nThe main ports of the Tyrrhenian Sea in Italy are: Naples, Palermo, Civitavecchia (Rome), Salerno, Trapani, and Gioia Tauro. There is also Bastia, located in Corsica.\nNote that even though the phrase \"port of Rome\" is frequently used, there is in fact no port in Rome. Instead, the \"port of Rome\" refers to the maritime facilities at Civitavecchia, some to the northwest of Rome.\nGiglio Porto is a small island port in this area. It rose to prominence, when the \"Costa Concordia\" ran aground near the coast of Giglio and sank. The ship was later refloated and towed to Genoa for scrapping.\nWinds.\nIn Greek mythology, it is believed that the cliffs above the Tyrrhenian Sea housed the four winds kept by Aeolus. The winds are the Mistral from the Rh\u00f4ne valley, the Libeccio from the southwest, and the Sirocco and Ostro from the south.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

From 1964 to 1966, he was an instructor in sociology at Vassar College.\nDuring college and graduate school, Nelson began to envision a computer-based writing system that would provide a lasting repository for the world's knowledge, and also permit greater flexibility of drawing connections between ideas. This came to be known as Project Xanadu.\nMuch later in life, in 2002, Nelson obtained his PhD in media and governance from Keio University.\nProject Xanadu.\nNelson first conceived of what would become Project Xanadu in the early 1960s, with the goal of creating a computer network with a simple user interface. He started referring to this project to others using the name Xanadu in 1966. The effort is documented in the books \"Computer Lib/Dream Machines\" (1974), \"The Home Computer Revolution\" (1977) and \"Literary Machines\" (1981). Much of his adult life has been devoted to working on Xanadu and advocating for it.\nThroughout his career, Nelson supported his work on the Xanadu project through a variety of administrative, academic, and research positions and consultancies, including stints at Harcourt Brace and Company Brown University (a tumultuous consultancy on the Nelson-inspired Hypertext Editing System and File Retrieval and Editing System with Swarthmore friend Andries van Dam's group; c. 1967\u20131969), Bell Labs (hypertext-related defense research; 1968\u20131969), CBS Laboratories (\"writing and photographing interactive slideshows for their AVS-10 instructional device\"; 1968\u20131969), the University of Illinois at Chicago (an interdisciplinary staff position; 1973\u20131976) and Swarthmore College (visiting lecturer in computing; 1977).\nNelson also conducted research and development under the auspices of the Nelson Organization (founder and president; 1968\u20131972) and the Computopia Corporation (co-founder; 1977\u20131978). Clients of the former firm included IBM, Brown University, Western Electric, the University of California, the Jewish Museum, the Fretheim Chartering Corporation and the Deering-Milliken Research Corporation. He has alleged that the Nelson Organization was envisaged as a clandestine funding conduit for the Central Intelligence Agency, which expressed interest in Project Xanadu at an early juncture; however, the promised funds failed to materialize after several benchmarks were met.\nFrom 1980 to 1981, he was the editor of \"Creative Computing\". At the behest of Xanadu developers Mark S. Miller and Stuart Greene, Nelson joined San Antonio, Texas-based Datapoint as chief software designer (1981\u20131982), remaining with the company as a media specialist and technical writer until its Asher Edelman-driven restructuring in 1984. Following several San Antonio-based consultancies and the acquisition of Xanadu technology by Autodesk in 1988, he continued working on the project as a non-managerial Distinguished Fellow in the San Francisco Bay Area until the divestiture of the Xanadu Operating Group in 1992\u20131993.\nAfter holding visiting professorships in media and information science at Hokkaido University (1995\u20131996), Keio University (1996\u20132002), the University of Southampton and the University of Nottingham, he was a fellow (2004\u20132006) and visiting fellow (2006\u20132008) of the Oxford Internet Institute in conjunction with Wadham College, Oxford. More recently, he has taught classes at Chapman University and the University of California, Santa Cruz.\nThe Xanadu project failed to flourish, for a variety of reasons which are disputed. Journalist Gary Wolf published an unflattering history of Nelson and his project in the June 1995 issue of \"Wired\", calling it \"the longest-running vaporware project in the history of computing\". On his own website, Nelson expressed his disgust with the criticisms, referring to Wolf as \"Gory Jackal\", and threatened to sue him. He also outlined his objections in a letter to \"Wired\", and released a detailed rebuttal of the article.\nAs early as 1972, a demonstration iteration developed by Cal Daniels failed to reach fruition when Nelson was forced to return the project's rented Data General Nova minicomputer due to financial exigencies. Nelson has stated that some aspects of his vision were fulfilled by Tim Berners-Lee's invention of the World Wide Web, but he disliked the World Wide Web, XML, and embedded markup \u2013 regarding Berners-Lee's work as a gross over-simplification of his original vision: HTML is precisely what we were trying to PREVENT\u2014 ever-breaking links, links going outward only, quotes you can't follow to their origins, no version management, no rights management.\nJaron Lanier explained the difference between the World Wide Web and Nelson's vision, and the implications: \nA core technical difference between a Nelsonian network and what we have become familiar with online is that [Nelson's] network links were two-way instead of one-way. In a network with two-way links, each node knows what other nodes are linked to it. ... Two-way linking would preserve context. It's a small simple change in how online information should be stored that couldn't have vaster implications for culture and the economy.\nOther projects.\nIn 1957, Nelson co-wrote and co-produced what he describes as a pioneering rock musical entitled \"Anything and Everything\"; it was performed at Swarthmore College. Two years later, during his senior year at Swarthmore, Nelson made an experimental humorous student film, \"The Epiphany of Slocum Furlow\", in which the titular hero discovers the meaning of life. Musician and composer Peter Schickele, also a student at Swarthmore College, scored the film.\nIn 1965, Nelson presented the paper \"Complex Information Processing: A File Structure for the Complex, the Changing, and the Indeterminate\" at the ACM National Conference, in which he coined the term \"hypertext\".\nIn 1976, Nelson co-founded and briefly served as the advertising director of the \"itty bitty machine company\", or \"ibm\", a small computer retail store that operated from 1977 to 1980 in Evanston, Illinois. In 1978, he had a significant impact upon IBM's thinking when he outlined his vision of the potential of personal computing to the team that three years later launched the IBM PC.\nFrom the 1960s to the mid-2000s, Nelson built an extensive collection of direct advertising mail he received in his mailbox, mainly from companies selling products in IT, print/publishing, aerospace, and engineering. In 2017, the Internet Archive began to publish it online in scanned form, in a collection titled \"Ted Nelson's Junk Mail Cartons\".\nZigZag.\nAs of 2011, Nelson was working on a new information structure, ZigZag, which is described on the Xanadu project website, which also hosts two versions of the Xanadu code. He also developed XanaduSpace, a system for the exploration of connected parallel documents (an early version of this software may be freely downloaded).\nInfluence and recognition.\nIn January 1988 \"Byte\" magazine published an article about Nelson's ideas, titled \"Managing Immense Storage\".\nIn 1998, at the Seventh WWW Conference in Brisbane, Australia, Nelson was awarded the Yuri Rubinsky Memorial Award.\nIn 2001, he was knighted by France as Officier des Arts et Lettres. In 2007, he celebrated his 70th birthday by giving an invited lecture at the University of Southampton. In 2014, ACM SIGCHI honored him with a Special Recognition Award.\nIn 2014, Nelson was conferred with a Doctor of Science degree, honoris causa, by Chapman University. The ceremony took place during the 'Intertwingled' conference, featuring Nelson and other prominent figures in the field, including Apple Computer founder Steve Wozniak and former Association for Computing Machinery president Wendy Hall. At the conference, Nelson stated confidence in the potential of his Xanadu system, saying 'The world would have been a better place if I had succeeded, but I ain't dead yet.'\nNeologisms.\nNelson is credited with coining several new words that have come into common usage especially in the world of computing. Among them are:\nPublications.\nNelson publishes some of his books through his self-owned Mindful Press.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Additionally, they can be used as exercises to improve pronunciation and fluency. Some tongue twisters produce results that are humorous (or humorously vulgar) when they are mispronounced, while others simply rely on the confusion and mistakes of the speaker for their amusement value.\nTypes.\nSome tongue twisters rely on rapid alternation between similar but distinct phonemes (e.g., \"s\" and \"sh\" ), combining two different alternation patterns, familiar constructs in loanwords, or other features of a spoken language in order to be difficult to articulate. For example, the following sentence was said to be \"the most difficult of common English-language tongue twisters\" by William Poundstone.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The seething sea ceaseth and thus the seething sea sufficeth us.\nThese deliberately difficult expressions were popular in the 19th century. The popular \"she sells seashells\" tongue twister was originally published in 1850 as a diction exercise. The term \"tongue twister\" was first applied to this kind of expression in 1895.\n\"She sells seashells\" was turned into a popular song in 1908, with words by British songwriter Terry Sullivan and music by Harry Gifford. According to folklore, it was said to be inspired by the life and work of Mary Anning, an early fossil collector. However, there is no evidence that Anning inspired either the tongue twister or the song.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nAnother well-known tongue twister is \"Peter Piper\":\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nMany tongue twisters use a combination of alliteration and rhyme. They have two or more sequences of sounds that require repositioning the tongue between syllables, then the same sounds are repeated in a different sequence. An example of this is the song \"Betty Botter\" (), first published in 1899:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThere are twisters that make use of compound words and their stems, for example:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThe following twister entered a contest in \"Games Magazine\" on the November/December 1979 issue and was announced the winner on the March/April 1980 issue:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSome tongue twisters take the form of words or short phrases which become tongue twisters when repeated rapidly (the game is often expressed in the form \"Say this phrase three (or five, or ten, etc.) times as fast as you can!\"). Examples include:\nSome tongue twisters are used for speech practice and vocal warmup:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nTongue twisters are used to train pronunciation skills in non-native speakers:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The sheep on the ship slipped on the sheet of sleet.\nOther types of tongue twisters derive their humor from producing vulgar results only when performed incorrectly:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSome twisters are amusing because they sound incorrect even when pronounced correctly:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nIn 2013, MIT researchers claimed that this is the trickiest twister to date:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Pad kid poured curd pulled cold\nLinguistics.\nPhonemes.\nBased on the MIT confusion matrix of 1620 single phoneme errors, the phoneme with the greatest margin of speech error is \"l\" [l] mistaken for \"r\" [r]. Other phonemes that had a high level of speech error include \"s\" [s] mistaken for \"sh\" [\u0283], \"f\" [f] for \"p\" [p], \"r\" [r] for \"l\" [l], \"w\" [w] for \"r\" [r], and many more. These sounds are most likely to transform to a similar sound when placed in near vicinity of each other. Most of these mix-ups can be attributed to the two phonemes having similar areas of articulation in the mouth.\nPronunciation difficulty is also theorized to have an effect on tongue twisters. For example, \"t\" [t] is thought to be easier to pronounce than \"ch\" [t\u0283]. As a result, speakers may naturally transform \"ch\" [t\u0283] to \"t\" [t] or when trying to pronounce certain tongue twisters.\nFortis and lenis.\nFortis and lenis are the classification of strong and weak consonants.\nSome characteristics of strong consonants include:\nIt is common for more difficult sounds to be replaced with strong consonants in tongue twisters. This is partially determinant of which sounds are most likely to transform to other sounds with linguistic confusion.\nOther languages.\nTongue twisters exist in many languages, such as , and .\nThe complexity of tongue twisters varies from language to language. For example, in Luganda vowels differ by length so tongue twisters exploit vowel length: \"Akawala akaawa Kaawa kaawa akaawa ka wa?\". Translation: \"The girl who gave Kaawa bitter coffee, where is she from?\"\nShibboleths.\nShibboleths, that is, phrases in a language that are difficult for someone who is not a native speaker of that language to say might be regarded as a type of tongue-twist. An example is Georgian \"baq'aq'i ts'q'alshi q'iq'inebs\" (\"a frog croaks in the water\"), in which \"q\"' is a uvular ejective. Another example, the Czech and Slovak \"str\u010d prst skrz krk\" (\"stick a finger through the throat\") is difficult for a non-native speaker due to the absence of vowels, although syllabic r is a common sound in Czech, Slovak and some other Slavic languages.\nFinger-fumblers.\nThe sign language equivalent of a tongue twister is called a finger-fumbler. According to Susan Fischer, the phrase \"Good blood, bad blood\" is a tongue twister in English as well as a finger-fumbler in ASL.\nOne-syllable article.\nOne-syllable article is a form of Mandarin Chinese tongue twister, written in Classical Chinese. Due to Mandarin Chinese having only four tonal ranges (compared to nine in Cantonese, for example), these works sound like a work of one syllable in different tonal range when spoken in Mandarin, but are far more comprehensible when spoken in another dialect.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
