Events in the chronicle include the apocalyptic destruction of Martian and human civilizations though there are no stories with settings at the catastrophes. The outcomes of many stories raise concerns about the values and direction of America of the time by addressing militarism, science, technology, and war-time prosperity that could result in a global nuclear war (e.g., \"There Will Come Soft Rains\" and \"); depopulation that might be considered genocide (e.g., \", \", and \"); racial oppression and exploitation (e.g., \"); ahistoricism, philistinism, and hostility towards religion (e.g., \"); and censorship and conformity (e.g., \"\"). On Bradbury's award of a Pulitzer Prize Special Citation in 2007, the book was recognized as one of his \"masterworks that readers carry with them over a lifetime\".\nStructure and plot summary.\nFix-up structure.\n\"The Martian Chronicles\" is a fix-up novel consisting of published short stories along with new short bridge narratives in the form of interstitial vignettes, intercalary chapters, or expository narratives. The published stories were revised for consistency and refinement.\nBradbury did not write \"The Martian Chronicles\" as a singular work: Its creation as a novel was suggested to Bradbury by a publisher's editor years after most of the stories had first appeared in different publications (see publication history and original publication notes under Contents). In responding to the suggestion, the 29-year-old Bradbury remembers saying: \"Oh, my God ... I read \"Winesburg, Ohio\" by Sherwood Anderson when I was 24 and I said to myself, 'Oh God, wouldn't it be wonderful if someday I could write a book as good as this but put it on the planet Mars.'\" (See the Influences section on literary influences affecting the work's structure.)\nChronicle structure.\n\"The Martian Chronicles\" is written as a chronicle, each story presented as a chapter within an overall chronological ordering of the plot. Overall, it can be viewed as three extended episodes or parts, punctuated by two apocalyptic events. Events in the book's original edition ranged from 1999 to 2026. As 1999 approached in real life, the dates were advanced by 31 years in the 1997 edition. The summary that follows includes the dates of both editions.\nPublication history.\nThe creation of \"The Martian Chronicles\" by weaving together previous works was suggested to the author by New York City representatives of Doubleday &amp; Company in 1949 after Norman Corwin recommended Bradbury travel to the city to be \"'discovered'\". The work was subsequently published in hardbound form by Doubleday in the United States in 1950. Publication of the book was concurrent with the publication of Bradbury's short story, \"There Will Come Soft Rains\" that appeared in \"Collier's\" magazine. The short story appears as a chapter in the novel, though with some differences. The novel has been reprinted numerous times by many different publishers since 1950.\nThe Spanish language version of \"The Martian Chronicles\", \"\", was published in Argentina concurrently with the U.S. first edition, and included all the chapters contained in the U.S. edition. The edition included a foreword by Jorge Luis Borges.\nThe book was published in the United Kingdom under the title \"The Silver Locusts\" (1951), with slightly different contents. In some editions the story \"The Fire Balloons\" was added, and the story \"Usher II\" was removed to make room for it.\nThe book was published in\u00a01963 as part of the Time Reading Program with an introduction by Fred Hoyle.\nIn\u00a01979, Bantam Books published a trade paperback edition with illustrations by Ian Miller.\nAs 1999 approached, the fictional future written into the first edition was in jeopardy, so the work was revised and a 1997 edition was published to advance all of the dates by 31 years (with the plot running from 2030 to 2057 instead of 1999 to 2026). The 1997 edition added \" and \", and omitted \"\", a story considered less topical in 1997 than 1950.\nThe 1997 edition of \"Cr\u00f3nicas Marcianas\" included the same revisions as the U.S. 1997 edition.\nIn 2009, the Subterranean Press and PS Publishing published \"The Martian Chronicles: The Complete Edition \"that included the 1997 edition of the work and additional stories under the title \"The Other Martian Tales\". (See \"The Other Martian Tales\" section of this article.)\nContents.\nBradbury culled the table of contents for \"The Martian Chronicles\" \"Chronology\" with each item formatted with the date of the story followed by a colon followed by the story title. The title of each chapter in the first edition was the corresponding line in \"Chronology\". In the 1997 edition, chapter titles omitted the colons by printing the date and the story title on separate lines. The chapter titles that follow are formatted consistent with the \"Chronology\". The years are those appearing in the first edition followed by the year appearing in 1997 edition.\nPublication information concerning short stories published prior to their appearance in \"The Martian Chronicles\" is available in Ray Bradbury short fiction bibliography.\nJanuary 1999/2030: Rocket Summer.\nPublication history.\nFirst appeared in \" The Martian Chronicles\". Not to be confused with the short story of the same name published in 1947.\nPlot.\n\"Rocket Summer\" is a short vignette that describes the rocket launch of the first human expedition to Mars on a cold winter day in Ohio.\nFebruary 1999/2030: Ylla.\nPublication history.\nFirst published as \"I'll Not Ask for Wine\" in \"Maclean's\", January\u00a01, 1950.\nPlot.\nYlla, an unhappily married Martian, who, like all Martians, has telepathy, receives an impression of the human space traveler Nathaniel York. Ylla sings the 17th century song \"Drink to Me Only with Thine Eyes\" (with lyrics from the poem \"To Celia\" by Ben Jonson), in English she does not understand. She has a romantic dream involving him, in which he takes her back to Earth. Her jealous husband, Yll, kills York and her memories fade.\nAugust 1999/2030: The Summer Night.\nPublication history.\nFirst published as \"The Spring Night\" in \"The Arkham Sampler\", winter\u00a01949.\nPlot.\nAn idyllic Martian summer night is disrupted when Martian adults and children spontaneously start to sing the words from English poems and children's rhymes they do not understand, including Lord Byron's \"She Walks in Beauty\" and \"Old Mother Hubbard\". The music, poems and rhymes emanate from astronauts aboard the Second Expedition's spaceship heading towards Mars. The Martians are terrified and sense that a terrible event will occur the next morning.\nAugust 1999/2030: The Earth Men.\nPublication history.\nFirst published in \"Thrilling Wonder Stories\", August\u00a01948.\nPlot.\nThe Second Expedition encounters members of a Martian community not far from their landing site. The Earth explorers, mistaken for delusional Martians, find themselves locked up in an insane asylum. A psychologist judges them to be incurably deluded and kills them, then kills himself in the belief that he too has gone insane.\nMarch 2000/2031: The Taxpayer.\nPublication history.\nFirst appeared in \"The Martian Chronicles\".\nPlot.\nA man named Pritchard believes he is entitled to be in the crew of the Third Expedition because he is a taxpayer. He does not want to be left on Earth because \"there's going to be an atomic war.\"\nApril 2000/2031: The Third Expedition.\nPublication history.\nFirst published as \"Mars is Heaven!\" in \"Planet Stories\", fall\u00a01948. The original short story was set in 1960. The story in \" The Martian Chronicles \" contains paragraph about medical treatments that slow the aging process, so that the characters can be traveling to Mars in 2000 but still remember the 1920s.\nPlot.\nThe Third Expedition find themselves lulled into a collective hallucination by the Martians and then killed by them. The ending leaves it ambiguous whether this was the plan of the Martians all along, or, given the telepathic origins of the hallucination and the way it was molded to their expectations and desires, Captain John Black accidentally willed it into being by coming to believe the hallucination was a trap for those perceived as invaders.\nJune 2001/2032: \u2014And the Moon Be Still as Bright.\nPublication history.\nFirst published in \"Thrilling Wonder Stories\", June\u00a01948.\nPlot.\nThe Fourth Expedition lands on the opposite side of Mars and finds all the Martians dead, having contracted and been killed by chicken pox inadvertently introduced by the previous expeditions. Crew member Jeff Spender becomes repelled by the others' ugly American attitudes as they explore a dead Martian city and begins to kill the others to ensure no further human incursions ruin Mars.\nAugust 2001/2032: The Settlers.\nPublication history.\nFirst appeared in \"The Martian Chronicles\".\nPlot.\n\"The Settlers\" is a vignette that describes the \"Lonely Ones\", the first settlers of Mars, single men from the United States who are few in number.\nDecember 2001/2032: The Green Morning.\nPublication history.\nFirst appeared in \"The Martian Chronicles\".\nPlot.\nBenjamin Driscoll is an emigrant who faces the prospect of having to return to Earth because he has difficulty breathing in the thin Martian atmosphere. Driscoll believes Mars can be made more hospitable by planting trees to enrich the air with oxygen, and is stunned to see the seeds he has planted grow into a fully mature forest overnight. Referencing this story, Driscoll Forest is a place named in \"\".\nFebruary 2002/2033: The Locusts.\nPublication history.\nFirst appeared in \"The Martian Chronicles\".\nPlot.\nA vignette describing the arrival of ninety thousand American emigrants to Mars.\nAugust 2002/2033: Night Meeting.\nPublication history.\nFirst appeared in \"The Martian Chronicles\".\nPlot.\n\"Night Meeting\" is the story of Tom\u00e1s Gomez, a young Latino construction worker on Mars, who drives his truck across an empty expanse between towns to attend a party, and his encounters along the way with an elderly gas station owner and a Martian who appears to him as a phantom. They each regard each other as a dream.\nThe fearless Tom\u00e1s Gomez reflects a common Mexican attitude toward death, which Bradbury understood. Prior to the publication of \"The Martian Chronicles\" in 1950, two of his short stories relating to the Day of the Dead were published in 1947 \u2014 \"El D\u00eda de Muerte\" set on the Day of the Dead in Mexico City and \"The Next in Line\" that was published in his book \"Dark Carnival\" about a visit to catacombs in a Mexican village which terrifies the American protagonist. Both stories were likely inspired by his learning about Mexican death rites during his own frightful experience on a 1945 trip to Mexico that included a visit in Guanajuato where he viewed mummies.\nOctober 2002/2033: The Shore.\nPlot.\nThis vignette characterizes two successive groups of settlers as American emigrants who arrive in \"waves\" that \"spread upon\" the Martian \"shore\" \u2013 the first are the frontiersmen described in \"The Settlers\", and the second are men from the \"cabbage tenements and subways\" of urban America.\nNovember 2002/2033: The Fire Balloons.\nPublication history.\nThe story first appeared as \"\u2026In This Sign\" in \"Imagination\", April\u00a01951 after publication of the first (1950) edition of \"The Martian Chronicles\" and so, was included in the U.S. edition of \"The Illustrated Man\" and in \"The Silver Locusts\". The story was included in the 1997 edition of \"The Martian Chronicles\", though it appeared in earlier special editions \u2013 the 1974\u00a0edition from The Heritage Press, the September\u00a01979 illustrated trade edition from Bantam Books, the \"40th Anniversary Edition\" from Doubleday Dell Publishing Group and in the 2001 Book-of-the-Month Club edition.\nPlot.\n\"The Fire Balloons\" is a story about an Episcopal missionary expedition to cleanse Mars of sin, consisting of priests from large American cities led by the Most Reverend Father Joseph Daniel Peregrine and his assistant Father Stone. Peregrine has a passionate interest in discovering the kinds of sins that may be committed by aliens reflected in his book, \"The Problem of Sin on Other Worlds\". Peregrine and Stone argue constantly about whether the mission should focus on cleansing humans or Martians. With the question unanswered, the priests travel to Mars aboard the spaceship \"Crucifix\". The launch of the rocket triggers Peregrine's memories as a young boy of the Fourth of July with his grandfather.\nAfter landing on Mars, Peregrine and Stone meet with the mayor of First City, who advises them to focus their mission on humans. The mayor tells the priests that the Martians look like blue \"luminous globes of light\" and they saved the life of an injured prospector working in a remote location by transporting him to a highway. The mayor's description of the Martians triggers Peregine's endearing memories of himself launching fire balloons with his grandfather on Independence Day.\nPeregrine decides to search for and meet Martians, and he and Stone venture into the hills where the prospector encountered them. The two priests are met by a thousand fire balloons. Stone is terrified and wants to return to First City while Peregrine is overwhelmed by their beauty, imagines his grandfather is there with him to admire them, and wants to converse with them, though the fire balloons disappear. The two priests immediately encounter a rock slide, which Stone believes they escaped by chance and Peregrine believes they were saved by Martians. The two argue their disagreement, and during the night while Stone is sleeping, Peregrine tests his faith in his hunch by throwing himself off a high cliff. As he falls, Peregrine is surrounded by blue light and is set safely on the ground. Peregrine tells Stone of the experience but Stone believes Peregrine was dreaming, so Peregrine takes a gun which he fires at himself and the bullets drop at his feet, convincing his assistant.\nPeregrine uses his authority to have the mission build a church in the hills for the Martians. The church is for outdoor services and is constructed after six days of work. A blue glass sphere is brought as a representation of Jesus for the Martians. On the seventh day, a Sunday, Peregrine holds a service in which he plays an organ and uses his thoughts to summon the Martians. The fire balloons, who call themselves the Old Ones, appear as glorious apparitions to the priests and communicate the story of their creation, their immortality, their normally solitary existences, and their pure virtuousness. They thank the priests for building the church and tell them they are unneeded and ask them to relocate to the towns to cleanse the people there. The fire balloons depart, which fills Peregrine with such overwhelming sadness that he wants to be lifted up like his grandfather did when he was a small child. The priests are convinced and withdraw to First Town along with the blue glass sphere that has started to glow from within. Peregrine and Stone believe the sphere is Jesus.\nBradbury said he consulted a Catholic priest in Beverly Hills while he developed the plot for \"Fire Balloons\". In an interview, Bradbury recalled part of a day-long conversation: \"'Listen, Father, how would you act if you landed on Mars and found intelligent creatures in the form of balls of fire? Would you think you ought to save them or would you think they were saved already?' 'Wow! That's a hell of a fine question!' the father exclaimed. And he told me what he would do. In short, what I make Father Peregrine do.\"\nInterpretation of \"The Fire Balloons\" has been called \"ambiguous\" because its meaning can be dramatically different due to the context set by the stories that accompany it. Its first appearance in the U.S. in 1951 was as a stand-alone story as \"... In This Sign\" and in \"The Illustrated Man\" that was concurrent with its first appearance in \"The Silver Locusts\" in the U.K. which included all of \"The Martian Chronicles\" stories with Martian characters. Within \"The Silver Locusts\" and the 1997 edition of \"The Martian Chronicles\" the strategy used by Martians in \"The Fire Balloons\" is implicit \u2013 they use their telepathic powers to peacefully keep settlers away from their mountains. As in \"\" the Martians understand Father Peregrine's fond memories of his grandfather and the Fourth of July celebrations they shared together involving fire balloons before and after the \"Crucifix\" lands on Mars. As in \"\", an elaborate, imaginary world is constructed, though in \"The Fire Balloons\" it is for the priests to convince them to cleanse humans of sin in First City. The appearance of Martians as fire balloons ends with the chapter.\nFebruary 2003/2034: Interim.\nPublication history.\nFirst appeared in \"The Martian Chronicles\". Not to be confused with the short horror story or \"Time Intervening,\" which is also under that title.\nPlot.\nA vignette describing how the Tenth City is built by colonists.\nApril 2003/2034: The Musicians.\nPublication history.\nFirst appeared in \"The Martian Chronicles\".\nPlot.\nYoung boys defy their parents and habitually play in and among the otherwise unpopulated ruins of indigenous Martian towns where they perished in their homes. The Firemen methodically incinerate the remnants of Martian civilization and the bones of the Martians. The boys play amongst the relics and make Martian bones into musical instruments.\nMay 2003/2034: The Wilderness.\nPublication history.\nFirst appeared in \"The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction\", November\u00a01952. The story appears in the 1974\u00a0edition of \"The Martian Chronicles\" by The Heritage Press, the 1979 Bantam Books illustrated trade edition, and the 1997\u00a0edition of \"The Martian Chronicles\".\nPlot.\nIn Independence, Missouri, a woman, Janice Smith, expects a telephone call at midnight from her fianc\u00e9 Will on Mars. He has already purchased a home on Mars identical to her home on Earth. His response after the long delay due to the distance to Mars is incomplete due to natural interference so, she only hears him say \"love\". Smith contemplates being a pioneer as the women before her, and then falls asleep for the last time on Earth.\nJune 2003/2034: Way in the Middle of the Air.\nPublication history.\nFirst appeared in the first edition of \"The Martian Chronicles\" and not included in the 1997 edition. \nThe work later appeared in the July 1950 issue of \"Other Worlds Science Stories\" after five major magazines rejected the manuscript drafted in 1948.\nBradbury explained that the drafting of \"Way in the Middle of the Air\" was a common way he used writing to address his emotional state affecting him at a moment. He recalled in a 1962 interview that he was so upset about the circumstances of African-Americans in the United States that \"I put them in rocket ships and send them off to Mars, in a short story, to rid myself of that tension\".\nPublication of \"Way in the Middle of the Air\" in 1950 was groundbreaking for a science fiction story even though the work is considered limited by providing only the viewpoint of white Americans. According to Isiah Lavender III, \"Bradbury is one of the very few authors in [science fiction] who dared to consider the effects and consequences of race in America at a time when racism was sanctioned by the culture.\" Even with the story's limitations, Robert Crossley suggested that it might be considered \"the single most incisive episode of black and white relations in science fiction by a white author.\"\nPlot.\n\"Way in the Middle of the Air\" concerns the coming together of black people in the American South to build a rocket of their own and emigrate to Mars in search of a better life. Samuel Teece, a racist white hardware store owner in a small town, constantly denigrates the departing families and tries to stop one young man, Belter, from leaving because he owes Teece $50. The other travelers quickly take up a collection to settle the debt. Teece's employee Silly tries to leave as well, but Teece reminds Silly of a contract he allegedly signed that requires him to give notice before quitting. Only after Teece's grandfather volunteers to take Silly's place does Teece let the boy go. As Silly hurries after the others, he asks Teece what he will do at night once all the black people have left Earth. Teece realizes that Silly was mocking him about the lynchings in which he has participated; infuriated, he races after Silly but cannot get far due to all the possessions the travelers have left scattered on the road. Teece refuses to watch the rocket liftoff, but takes some comfort in the fact that Silly always addressed him as \"Mister.\"\n2004\u20132005/2035\u20132036: The Naming of Names.\nPublication history.\nFirst appeared in \"The Martian Chronicles\". (Not to be confused with the short story \"The Naming of Names\", first published in \"Thrilling Wonder Stories\", August\u00a01949, later published as \"Dark They Were, and Golden-Eyed\".)\nPlot.\n\"The Naming of Names\" is a short vignette about the names of places on Mars being given American names that memorialize the crews of the four exploratory expeditions, or \"mechanical\" or \"metal\" names, which replace the Martian names that were for geographic features and things in nature.\nThe vignette also describes tourists who visit Mars and shop, and describes the next wave of emigrants as \"sophisticates\" and people who \"instruct\" and \"rule\" and \"push\" other people about.\nApril 2005/2036: Usher II.\nPublication history.\nFirst published as \"Carnival of Madness\" in \"Thrilling Wonder Stories\", April\u00a01950. In 2010, Los Angeles artist Allois, in collaboration with Bradbury, released illustrated copies of \"Usher\" and \"Usher\u00a0II\". The story also appeared in the 2008 Harper Collins/ Voyager edition of \"The Illustrated Man\".\nSummary.\n\"Usher\u00a0II\" is a horror story and homage to Edgar Allan Poe about the wealthy William Stendahl and the house he built to murder the enemies that he has spent a year cultivating to think of him as a friend. Stendahl has essentially unlimited cash to pay for components to be brought by rocket from Earth. There are many robots to commit murder and play other roles such as Rapunzel letting down her long hair to coax enemies into the structure.\nMr. Bigelow is the architect who completed building a house to match Poe's \"The Fall of the House of Usher\" without understanding the reference because all books with undesirable concepts were burned in 1975, 35 years earlier, including Stendahl's own 50,000-book library (Cf. \"Fahrenheit 451\"). The repression started in a small way in 1950 (Cf. McCarthyism).\nThe house is complete with black died sedge, a hideous tarn, a crack through the structure, and mechanisms to ensure that the scene is in constant darkness. Stendahl's assistant Pikes, as evil as himself and also hideous, had been an actor in horror films that had been burned, and he was forbidden to perform even for himself in front of a mirror. Bradbury describes his performances as superior to, more appalling than, horror film actors of 1950, Lon Chaney, Boris Carloff, Bela Lugosi. \nA mechanical ape murders Mr Garrett, an investigator of Moral Climates, who had told Stendahl that he would have his place dismantled and burned later that day. It is later revealed, however, that Mr Garrett was himself a robot and the human Garrett turns up the following morning.\nStendahl and Pikes send invitations out to their enemies for a party, and about 30 arrive. They are subjected to an automated horror fantasy world based on Poe's \"The Premature Burial\", \"The Pit and the Pendulum\", and \"The Murders in the Rue Morgue\", and then killed. Many are women involved in various efforts consistent with the 1975 book burning. \nGarrett is treated as the character Fortunato from Poe's \"The Cask of Amontillado\". After Stendahl and Pikes have disposed of all their guests, they leave in a helicopter and, from above, watch the house break apart like the one in Poe's story.\nAugust 2005/2036: The Old Ones.\nPublication history.\nFirst appeared in \"The Martian Chronicles\".\nPlot.\n\"The Old Ones\" is a short vignette that describes the last wave of emigrants to Mars \u2013 elderly Americans. The title does not refer to the Martians in \"The Fire Balloons\".\nSeptember 2005/2036: The Martian.\nPublication history.\nFirst published in \"Super Science Stories\", November\u00a01949.\nPlot.\n\"The Martian\" is the story about an elderly married couple, LaFarge and Anna, who encounter a Martian who wants to live with them as their fourteen-year-old son, Tom, even though Tom died of pneumonia many years before.\nNovember 2005/2036: The Luggage Store.\nPublication history.\nFirst appeared in \"The Martian Chronicles\".\nPlot.\n\"The Luggage Store\" is a short dialogue between Father Peregrine and the elderly owner of a luggage store. The proprietor tells Peregrine that he heard on the radio that there will be a war on Earth, looks at Earth in the night sky, and tells the priest he finds the news incredible. Peregrine changes the proprietor's mind by telling him that news of war is unbelievable because Earth is so far away. The shop owner tells the priest of the hundred thousand new emigrants expected in the coming months and Peregrine comments that the travelers will be needed on Earth and that they will probably be turning back. The proprietor tells the priest that he'd better prepare his luggage for a quick sale after which the priest asks if the owner thinks all the emigrants on Mars will return to Earth. The owner believes so because the emigrants have not been on Mars for long, except for himself because he is so old. Peregrine tells the shopkeeper that he is wrong about staying on Mars. The owner is convinced again by the priest, and Peregrine buys a new valise to replace his old one.\nNovember 2005/2036: The Off Season.\nPublication history.\nFirst published in \"Thrilling Wonder Stories\", December\u00a01948.\nPlot.\n\"The Off Season\" is the story of former Fourth Expedition crewman Sam Parkhill, who is a character in \"\", and his wife Elma, and their encounters with Martians as they prepare to open the first hot dog stand on Mars, which is decorated with glass Sam broke off old Martian buildings. The Parkhills hope to become wealthy because one hundred thousand new emigrants are expected to arrive to establish Earth Settlement 101 nearby, though Elma points out that the new inhabitants will be Mexican and Chinese nationals. The couple is unaware that Earth is on the brink of global war because their radio is broken.\nDuring the evening, the Parkhills are approached by a Martian they spoke to earlier that day. The Martian learns the Parkhills do not know about the situation on Earth and as the Martian says he wants to show Sam a bronze tube that appears in the Martian's hand. Sam shoots the Martian dead with a gun believing the tube is a weapon. However, Elma discovers the tube contains a document written with Martian hieroglyphics neither of them understand. As Sam tells Elma that the Earth Settlement will protect him from Martians, Elma sees twelve Martian sand ships approaching and Sam believes the Martians want to kill him. Sam takes Elma onto a Martian sand ship he purchased at an auction and learned to operate, and takes off to a town for protection. As Sam's sand ship sails, a young woman appears on the ship's tiller bench. The woman, a vision, tells Sam to return to the hot dog stand. Sam refuses and tells the women to get off his ship. The vision argues that the ship is not his and claims it as part of the Martian world. Sam shoots the vision and it vanishes after breaking into crystals and vaporizing. Elma is disappointed in Sam and asks him to stop the ship, but Sam refuses. In frustration and to display his might, Sam destroys the crystal ruins of a Martian city by shooting them as the sand ship passes by, though Elma is unimpressed and then falls unconscious.\nAs Sam readies to shoot up another Martian city, three sand ships catch up with him. Sam shoots at them and one ship disintegrates and vaporizes along with its crew. As the two other ships approach Sam's, he gives up by stopping his ship. A Martian calls him, and Sam explains himself and surrenders by throwing down his gun. The Martian tells him to retrieve his gun and return to the hot dog stand where they want to explain something without harming him. Elma wakes up on the journey back.\nBack at the hot dog stand, the Martian Leader tells the Parkhills to ready it for operation and to have a celebration. The Leader produces the scrolls which he explains are grants to Sam that sum to half of the entire planet. Sam asks the Leader for an explanation for the gift but the Martians announce their departure and tell him to \"prepare\" and repeat that the land is his. Sam believes the Martians were telling him the rockets with the new emigrants are arriving, so Sam and Elma start preparing hot dogs. As they prepare food, Sam thinks of the hungry emigrants to feed and botches recitation of Emma Lazarus' poem \"The New Colossus\" which is on a plaque at the Statue of Liberty in Sam's hometown, New York City. Elma looks at Earth in the night sky and sees an explosion on the planet that gains Sam's attention. Elma tells Sam she believes no customers will be coming to the hot dog stand for a million years.\nIn \"\u2014And the Moon Be Still as Bright\", the bodies of dead Martians are corpses. Sam Parkhill's shooting of the Martians dead at his hot dog stand and on his sand ship are illusions projected by one or more Martians somewhere else.\nNovember 2005/2036: The Watchers.\nPublication history.\nFirst appeared in \"The Martian Chronicles\". Not to be confused with the 1945 short story of the same name.\nPlot.\n\"The Watchers\" is a short vignette about the concerns of the Martian colonists, who are all Americans, about reports of war on Earth. At nine o'clock in the night sky, they view an explosion that changes the color of Earth, though, three hours later the color returns to normal. At two o'clock in the morning, colonists receive a message that war had begun, that a stockpile of nuclear weapons \"prematurely\" detonated destroying the Australian continent, and that Los Angeles and London had been bombed. The message said \"come home\" repeatedly without explanation. The proprietor of a luggage store, who is a character in \"The Luggage Store\", sells out of stock early in the morning, as colonists prepare to return to Earth.\nDecember 2005/2036: The Silent Towns.\nPublication history.\nFirst published in \"Charm\", March\u00a01949.\nPlot.\n\"The Silent Towns\" is a story about thirty year old Walter Gripp, a miner who lived in a remote mountain shack and walked to the town of Marlin Village every two weeks to find a wife. On his December visit Gripp finds the town abandoned and happily helps himself to money, food, clothing, movies, and other luxuries, but soon realizes he is lonely. As he walks to return to his shack, Gripp hears a phone ringing in an abandoned house but he cannot reach it soon enough to communicate with the caller. He hears a telephone ringing in another house and misses the call and realizes he expects the caller to be a woman. In the abandoned home, he obtains a colony telephone directory and starts calling the listed numbers in alphabetical order but stops after contacting a woman's automated message service. Gripps tries his luck with telephone exchanges and government and public institutions, and then places where he thinks a woman would take herself. Gripp calls the biggest beauty parlor in New Texas City and reaches Genevieve Selsor but is cut off. He finds a car and drives a thousand miles to the Deluxe Beauty Salon, fantasizing about Selsor along the way. Gripp cannot find Selsor there and believes she drove to Marlin Village to find him, so he returns and finds Selsor at a beauty parlor holding a box of cream chocolates.\nGripps finds the twenty-seven-year old physically unattractive and suffers while they watch a Clark Gable movie together after which she pours perfume into her hair. They return to the beauty parlor and Selsor declares herself as the \"last lady on Mars\" and Gripp as the last man and presents him with a box containing a wedding dress. Gripp flees, driving across Mars to another tiny town to spend his life happily alone and ignoring any phone he hears ringing.\nApril 2026/2057: The Long Years.\nPublication history.\nFirst published in \"Maclean's\", September\u00a015, 1948.\nPlot.\n\"The Long Years\" is the story of the last days of the life of Hathaway, the physician/geologist crewman from the Fourth Expedition's story \"\". At night during a windstorm, Hathaway visits four graves on a hill away from his family's hut and asks the dead for forgiveness for what he's done because he was lonely. As he returns to the hut, he spots a rocket approaching. He tells the family of the \"good news\" of a rocket arrival in the morning. He goes to the nearby ruins of New New York City and sets it ablaze as a location for the rocket to land. Hathaway returns to the hut to serve wine to his family in celebration. He reminisces about missing all the rockets evacuating colonists from Mars when the Great War started because he and his whole family were doing archaeological work in the mountains. As his wife and three children drink their wine it all just runs down their chins.\nIn the morning, the family prepares to greet whoever is in the rocket ship, including a great breakfast. As the rocket lands, Hathaway suffers an angina attack while running toward it. He recovers and continues on. Wilder, who was captain of the Fourth Expedition, emerges, sees Hathaway and greets him. Wilder explains that he has been on a twenty-year mission to the outer solar system; reports that he surveyed Mars before landing and found only one other person, Walter Gripp, who decided to stay on Mars, Wilder ponders with Hathaway the fate of Earth; and agrees to take Hathaway and his family on his return to Earth. Hathaway compliments Wilder on his promotion to lead the twenty-year mission so that Wilder would not slow the development of Mars. Wilder orders his crew out of the spaceship to join Hathaway's family.\nOn their way to the family hut, Hathaway updates Wilder on the Fourth Expedition's crewmen. Hathway tells Wilder that he visits Jeff Spender's tomb annually to pay his respects, and about Sam Parkhill's hot dog stand which was abandoned a week after opening to return to Earth. Wilder observes Hathaway in physical distress and has his physician crewman check Hathaway. Hathaway tells Wilder that he has stayed alive just to await rescue and now that Wilder has arrived he can die. The doctor gives him a pill and then says what he just spoke was \"nonsense\". Hathway recovers and continues on to the family hut.\nAt the hut, Hathaway introduces his family to the crew. Wilder is struck by how young Hathaway's wife appears, given that he met her decades earlier, and he compliments her on her youthfulness. Wilder asks John, Hathaway's son, his age, and John answers twenty-three. Crewman Williamson tells Wilder that John is supposed to be forty-two. Wilder sends Williamson off to investigate on the pretense of checking up on their rocket. Williamson returns to report that he found the graves of Hathaway's wife and children, and that the gravestones said that they died of an unknown disease during July 2007/2038.\nAs breakfast ends, Hathaway stands and toasts the crew and his family, and as soon he is done he collapses and knows that he will soon be dead. Wilder wants to call the family in to see Hathaway, but Hathaway stops him. Hathaway says they would not understand and he would not want them to understand, and then dies. Wilder converses with Hathaway's wife and concludes that she and the children are all androids, created by Hathaway to keep him company after his wife and children died. The crew buries Hathaway in his family's graveyard.\nAs Wilder prepares to depart, Williamson asks Wilder about what should be done about the android family and specially asks whether they should be deactivated. Wilder rejects taking them to Earth and says deactivation never crossed his mind. Wilder hands Williamson a gun and tells the crewman that if he can do anything it is better than anything he can do. Williamson goes into the hut and returns to Wilder reporting that he pointed the gun at an android daughter, who responded by smiling, and that he felt shooting them would be \"murder\". Wilder speculates the androids could operate for up to two more centuries. The rocket departs, and the android family continues on with its endless routines, that includes, for no reason at all, the android wife nightly looking up at Earth in the sky and tending a fire.\nAugust 2026/2057: There Will Come Soft Rains.\nPublication history.\nFirst published in \"Collier's\", May\u00a06, 1950, and revised for inclusion in \"The Martian Chronicles\".\nPlot.\nAn unoccupied, highly automated house of the McClellan family that stands and operates intact in a California city that is otherwise obliterated by a nuclear bomb, and its destruction by a fire caused by a windstorm. The story marks the end of the United States as a nation. The story also commemorates the United States' atomic bombing of Hiroshima on August 5, 1945 (US time) during World War II. The title of the story was taken from Sara Teasdale's anti-war poem \"There Will Come Soft Rains\" originally published in 1918 during World War I and the 1918 Flu Pandemic.\nOctober 2026/2057: The Million-Year Picnic.\nPublication history.\nFirst published in \"Planet Stories\", summer 1946.\nPlot.\nWilliam Thomas, his wife Alice, and his three sons have traveled to Mars to escape war under the parents' pretense that the family is taking a fishing trip. Alice is noticeably pregnant with a girl. The family enjoys a warm Martian summer day along water-filled canals. William is troubled by the war on Earth and does his best to keep the children entertained though he mutters his concerns as stray thoughts his children do not completely comprehend. William draws the boys' attention on fish, the ancient Martian cities they pass by, and on finding Martians \u2013 the latter, William assures the boys that they will find. While boating in a canal William and his wife listen to a broadcast on their radio and are jolted by what they hear. William remotely detonates the family's rocket, throttles the boat faster to drown out the noise, collides with a wharf and stops. William tells the boys he did it to keep their location secret. William listens in on the atomic radio again and hears nothing for a couple of minutes. He tells the family, \"It's over at last\". William boats down the canal where they pass six Martian cities and asks the family to choose the best one. They choose the last one and William declares that it will be their new home. He tells the family that they will be joined by Bert Edward's family that includes four girls.\nThe family settles around a campfire. William burns a variety of documents in it, including government bonds. While doing that, he tells his sons that Earth has been destroyed, and that the way of life on Earth \"proved itself wrong\" through its own self-destruction. He warns his sons that he will tell them the last point everyday until they really understand it. William takes the family to the canal and tells the children that they will be taught what they need to learn and that they are going to see Martians. William stops at the canal and points to the family's reflection in the water.\nInfluences.\nFascination with Mars, the works of Edgar Rice Burroughs, and comics.\nBradbury's fascination with Mars started when he was a child, including depictions of Mars in the works of Edgar Rice Burroughs' \"The Gods of Mars\" and \"John Carter, Warrior of Mars\". Burroughs' influence on the author was immense, as Bradbury believed \"Burroughs is probably the most influential writer in the entire history of the world.\" Bradbury said that as a child, he memorized all of John Carter and Tarzan and repeated the stories to anyone who would listen. Harold Foster's 1931 series of Tarzan Sunday comics had such an impact on his life that \"\"The Martian Chronicles\" would never have happened\" otherwise.\nLiterary influences.\nRay Bradbury referred to \"The Martian Chronicles\" as \"a book of stories pretending to be a novel\". He credited a diverse set of literary influences that had an effect on the structure and literary style of \"The Martian Chronicles\", among them Sherwood Anderson, William Shakespeare, Saint-John Perse, and John Steinbeck, as well as Edgar Rice Burroughs, particularly the Barsoom stories and John Carter of Mars books.\nBradbury was particularly inspired by plot and character development in Sherwood Anderson's \"Winesburg, Ohio\" that helped him write \"vivid and real\" stories that improved his earlier writings that were \"lifeless robots, mechanical and motionless\". The author said the stories took their form as combinations of component \"Martian pens\u00e9es\" which were \"Shakespearian 'asides,' wandering thoughts, long night visions, predawn half-dreams\" honed in a manner inspired by the perfection of Saint-John Perse.\nThe combination of separate stories to create \"The Martian Chronicles\" as \"a half-cousin to a novel\" was a suggestion of Doubleday editor Walter Bradbury (no relation to the author), who paid Ray Bradbury $750 for the outline of the book. The author only then realized such a book would be comparable to his idea of \"Winesburg, Ohio\". For his approach to integrating previous work into a novel, Bradbury credited Sherwood Anderson's \"Winesburg, Ohio\" and John Steinbeck's \"The Grapes of Wrath\" as influences on the structure of the work. \"Winesburg, Ohio\" is a short story cycle, and \"The Grapes of Wrath\" separates narrative chapters with narrative expositions that serve as prologues to subsequent narrative chapters. The idea of using short vignettes, intercalary chapters, and expository narratives to connect the full-length \"Chronicle\" stories, their role in the overall work, and the literary style used to write them, Bradbury said were \"subconsciously borrowed\" from those in \"The Grapes of Wrath\", which he first read at age nineteen, the year the novel was published.\nReception.\nUpon publication, \"The Paris Review\" noted that \"\"The Martian Chronicles\" ... was embraced by the science-fiction community as well as critics, a rare achievement for the genre. Christopher Isherwood hailed Bradbury as 'truly original' and a 'very great and unusual talent'.\" Isherwood argued that Bradbury's works were \"tales of the grotesque and arabesque\", and compared them to the works of Edgar Allan Poe, writing that Bradbury \"already deserves to be measured against the greatest master of his particular genre.\" Writer and critic Anthony Boucher and critic J. Francis McComas praised \"Chronicles\" as \"a poet's interpretation of future history beyond the limits of any fictional form\". The writer L. Sprague de Camp, however, declared that Bradbury would improve \"when he escapes from the influence of Hemingway and Saroyan\", placing him in \"the tradition of anti-science-fiction writers [who] see no good in the machine age\". Still, de Camp acknowledged that Bradbury's \"stories have considerable emotional impact, and many will love them\".\nA decade of after its publication, Damon Knight in his \"Books\" column for \"F&amp;SF\" listed \"The Martian Chronicles\" on his top-ten science fiction books of the\u00a01950s.\nBy September 1979 more than three million copies of \"The Martian Chronicles\" had been sold.\nLegacy.\nContinued popularity of \"The Martian Chronicles\".\nOn November 28, 1964, the NASA spacecraft Mariner 4 flew by Mars and took the first close-up pictures of the Martian surface that were far different than those described by Ray Bradbury. In spite of direct visual and scientific information since then that indicates that Mars is nothing like Bradbury's descriptions in \"The Martian Chronicles\", the novel remains a popular work of \"classic short stories\", \"science fiction\", and \"classic fiction anthologies and collections\" as indicated by the Amazon book store best seller lists. In an introduction to a 2015 edition of the work, Canadian astronaut and former International Space Station commander Chris Hadfield speculated on the continuing popularity of the work, attributing it to beautiful descriptions of the Martian landscape, its ability to \"challenge and inspire\" the reader to reflect on humanity's history of related follies and failures, and the popular idea that someday some people will come to accept Mars as being their permanent home. Bradbury attributed the attraction of readers to his book because the story is a myth or fable rather than science fiction. He said \"... even the most deeply rooted physicists at Cal-Tech accept breathing the fraudulent oxygen atmosphere I have loosed on Mars. Science and machines can kill each other off or be replaced. Myth, seen in mirrors, incapable of being touched, stays on. If it is not immortal, it almost seems such.\"\nBradbury Landing on Mars.\nThe August 6, 2012, Martian landing site of \"Curiosity\", NASA's Mars Rover, was named Bradbury Landing in honor of Ray Bradbury on August 22, 2012, on what would have been the author's 92nd birthday. On naming it, Michael Meyer, NASA program scientist for \"Curiosity\", said: \"This was not a difficult choice for the science team. Many of us and millions of other readers were inspired in our lives by stories Ray Bradbury wrote to dream of the possibility of life on Mars.\"\nAdaptations.\nTheater.\nA stage production of \"\" was produced at the Desilu Studios Gower Studios, Hollywood, California in 1962.\nThe debut of a theater adaptation of \"The Martian Chronicles\" was at the Cricket Theater (The Ritz) in Northeast Minneapolis in 1976.\nFilm.\nIn 1960, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer bought the film rights but no film was made.\nIn\u00a01988, the Soviet Armenian studio Armenfilm produced the feature film \"The 13th Apostle\", starring Juozas Budraitis, Donatas Banionis, Armen Dzhigarkhanyan, based on \"The Martian Chronicles\". The film was directed by Armenian actor and screenwriter, Suren Babayan.\nThe Uzbek filmmaker Nozim To'laho'jayev made two films based on sections from the book: 1984's animated short \"There Will Come Soft Rains\" (Russian: \u0411\u0443\u0434\u0435\u0442 \u043b\u0430\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0432\u044b\u0439 \u0434\u043e\u0436\u0434\u044c) and 1987's full-length live action film \"Veld\" (Russian: \u0412\u0435\u043b\u044c\u0434), with one of the subplots based on \"The Martian\".\nIn 2011 Paramount Pictures acquired the film rights with the intention of producing a film franchise, with John Davis producing through Davis Entertainment.\nMusic.\n\"The Martian Chronicles\" was adapted as a full-length contemporary opera by composer Daniel Levy and librettist Elizabeth Margid. This is the only musical adaptation authorized by Bradbury himself, who turned down Lerner and Loewe in the 1960s when they asked his permission to make a musical based on the novel. The work received its initial readings from the Harriet Lake Festival of New Plays at the Orlando Shakespeare Theater in 2006, and was presented in workshop form in the inaugural season of the Fordham University Lincoln Center Alumni Company in 2008. The \"Night Meeting\" episode was presented at Cornelia Street Cafe's \"Entertaining Science\" series on June 9, 2013. The entire work was presented as a staged reading with a cast of Broadway actors at Ars Nova NYC on February 11, 2015. Three scenes were presented as a workshop production with immersive staging, directed by Carlos Armesto of Theatre C and conducted by Benjamin Smoulder at Miami University, Oxford OH on September 17\u201319, 2015.\nIn 2001 a Danish melodic metal band Royal Hunt released a concept album called \"The Mission,\" based on \"The Martian Chronicles.\"\nHungarian progressive rock band Solaris named their first studio album \"Marsb\u00e9li Kr\u00f3nik\u00e1k\" in honour of \"The Martian Chronicles\".\nRadio.\n\"The Martian Chronicles\" was adapted for radio in the science fiction radio series \"Dimension X\". This truncated version contained elements of the stories \"Rocket Summer\", \"Ylla\", \"\u2013and the Moon Be Still as Bright\", \"The Settlers\", \"The Locusts\", \"The Shore\", \"The Off Season\", \"There Will Come Soft Rains\", and \"The Million-Year Picnic\".\n\"\u2014and the Moon Be Still as Bright\" and \"There Will Come Soft Rains\" were also adapted for separate episodes in the same series. The short stories \"Mars Is Heaven\" and \"Dwellers in Silence\" also appeared as episodes of \"Dimension\u00a0X\". The latter is in a very different form from the one found in \"The Martian Chronicles\".\nA very abridged spoken word reading of \"There Will Come Soft Rains\" and \"Usher\u00a0II\" was made in\u00a01975 with Leonard Nimoy as narrator.\nA BBC Radio 4 adaption, produced by Andrew Mark Sewell as an hour-long programme and starring Derek Jacobi as Captain Wilder, was broadcast on June 21, 2014, as part of the \"Dangerous Visions\" series.\nTelevision miniseries.\nIn\u00a01979 NBC partnered with the BBC to commission \"The Martian Chronicles\", a three-episode miniseries adaptation running just over four hours. It was written by Richard Matheson and was directed by Michael Anderson. Rock Hudson starred as Wilder, Darren McGavin as Parkhill, Bernadette Peters as Genevieve Selsor, Bernie Casey as Jeff Spender, Roddy McDowall as Father Stone, and Barry Morse as Hathaway, as well as Fritz Weaver. Bradbury found the miniseries \"just boring\".\nTelevision adaptations of individual stories.\nThe cable television series \"The Ray Bradbury Theater\" adapted some individual short stories from \"The Martian Chronicles\" including \"Mars is Heaven\", \"The Earthmen\", \"And the Moon Be Still as Bright\", \"Usher II\", \"The Martian\", \"Silent Towns\", and \"The Long Years\". Video releases of the series included a VHS\u00a0tape entitled \"Ray Bradbury's Chronicles: The Martian Episodes \" with some editions with three episodes and others with five.\nComic books.\nSeveral of the short stories in \"The Martian Chronicles\" were adapted into graphic novel-style stories in the EC Comics magazines, including \"There Will Come Soft Rains\" in \"Weird Fantasy\"\u00a0#17, \"The Long Years\" in \"Weird Science\"\u00a0#17, \"Mars Is Heaven\" in \"Weird Science\"\u00a0#18, \"The Million-Year Picnic\" in \"Weird Fantasy\"\u00a0#21 and \"The Silent Towns\" in \"Weird Fantasy\"\u00a0#22.\nIn 2011, Hill &amp; Wang published \"Ray Bradbury's The Martian Chronicles: The Authorized Adaptation\" as a graphic novel, with art by Dennis Calero.\nVideo games.\n\"The Martian Chronicles\" adventure game was published in 1996.\n\"The Other Martian Tales\".\n\"The Martian Chronicles: The Complete Edition\" published in 2009 by Subterranean Press and PS Publishing contains the 1997 edition of \"The Martian Chronicles\" with an additional collection of stories under the title \"The Other Martian Tales\", which includes the following:\n\"The Other Martian Stories\" also includes the 1964 and 1997 \"The Martian Chronicles\" screenplays, \nand essays by John Scalzi, Marc Scott Zicree, and Richard Matheson.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "37322", "revid": "50464814", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37322", "title": "Aeneid", "text": "Latin epic poem by Virgil\nThe Aeneid ( ; ) is a Latin epic poem that tells the legendary story of Aeneas, a Trojan who fled the fall of Troy and travelled to Italy, where he became the ancestor of the Romans. Written by the Roman poet Virgil between 29 and 19\u00a0BC, the \"Aeneid\" comprises 9,896 lines in dactylic hexameter. The first six of its twelve books tell the story of Aeneas' wanderings from Troy to Italy, and the latter six tell of the Trojans' ultimately victorious war upon the Latins, under whose name Aeneas and his Trojan followers are destined to be subsumed.\nThe hero Aeneas was already known to Graeco-Roman legend and myth, having been a character in the \"Iliad\". Virgil took the disconnected tales of Aeneas' wanderings, his vague association with the foundation of Rome, and his description as a personage of no fixed characteristics other than a scrupulous \"pietas\", and fashioned the \"Aeneid\" into a compelling founding myth or national epic that tied Rome to the legends of Troy, explained the Punic Wars, glorified traditional Roman virtues, and legitimised the Julio-Claudian dynasty as descendants of the founders, heroes, and gods of Rome and Troy.\nThe \"Aeneid\" is widely regarded as Virgil's masterpiece and one of the greatest works of Latin literature.\nMythology and origins.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nAlthough the definitive story of Aeneas escaping the fallen Troy and finding a new home in Italy, thus eventually becoming the ancestor of the Romans, was codified by Virgil, the myth of Aeneas' post-Troy adventures predates him by centuries. As Greek settlements began to expand starting in the sixth century BC, Greek colonists would often try to connect their new homes, and the native people they found there, to their pre-existing mythology; the \"Odyssey\" containing Odysseus's travels in many far away lands already provided such a link. Aeneas's story reflects not just Roman, but rather a combination of various Greek, Etruscan, Latin and Roman elements. Troy provided for a very suitable narrative for the Greek colonists in Magna Graecia and Sicily who wished to link their new homelands with themselves, and the Etruscans, who would have adopted the story of Aeneas in Italy first, and quickly became associated with him.\nGreek vases as early as the sixth century BC provide evidence for these early Greek mythological accounts of Aeneas founding a new home in Etruria predating Virgil by a wide margin, and he was known to have been worshipped in Lavinium, the city he founded. The discovery of thirteen large altars in Lavinium indicates early Greek influence, dating to the sixth through fourth century BC. In the following centuries, the Romans would come in contact with Greek colonies, conquer them and subsume the legend of Aeneas into their own mythological narratives. It is most likely that they fully became interested in Greek myths\u2014and their incorporation into their own foundation legends concerning Rome and the Roman people\u2014following the war against King Pyrrhus of Epirus in 280 BC, as Troy offered a way to insert Rome into Greek historical tradition as good as the one it had in the past for Greeks to link themselves to their new lands.\nLiterary evidence of a pre-Virgil attestation of Aeneas' journey can also be found. A fragment usually attributed to the fifth-century BC logographer Hellanicus of Lesbos' lost \"History of the Priestesses of Argos\" states that Rome was founded by Aeneas with the help of Odysseus and named after Rhome, a Trojan woman Aeneas was acquainted with. The attribution of this passage to Hellanicus has been met with some doubt and rejection, but other scholars are less dismissive. Around the fourth century BC, an otherwise unknown Alcimus apparently made Aeneas the father of Romulus by Thyrrenia. Romulus' then grandson Rhomus (Remus) went on to found Rome.\nStory.\nThe \"Aeneid\" can be divided into halves based on the disparate subject matter of Books 1\u20136 (Aeneas' journey to Latium in Italy), commonly associated with Homer's \"Odyssey\", and Books 7\u201312 (the war in Latium), mirroring the \"Iliad\". These two halves are commonly regarded as reflecting Virgil's ambition to rival Homer by treating both the \"Odyssey\"'s wandering theme and the \"Iliad\"'s warfare themes. This is, however, a rough correspondence.\nJourney to Italy (books 1\u20136).\nTheme.\nVirgil begins his poem with a statement of his theme (\"\u00a0...\", \"Of arms and the man I sing\u00a0...\") and an invocation to the Muse, falling some seven lines after the poem's inception (\"\u00a0...\", \"O Muse, recount to me the causes\u00a0...\"). He then explains the reason for the principal conflict in the story: the resentment held by the goddess Juno against the Trojan people. This is consistent with her role throughout the Homeric epics.\nBook 1: Storm and refuge.\nIn the manner of Homeric epic, the story begins \"in medias res\" (into the middle of things), with the Trojan fleet in the eastern Mediterranean, heading in the direction of Italy. The fleet, led by Aeneas, is on a voyage to find a second home. It has been foretold that in Italy he will give rise to a race both noble and courageous, a race which will become known to all nations. Juno is wrathful, because she had not been chosen in the judgement of Paris, and because her favourite city, Carthage, will be destroyed by Aeneas' descendants. Also, Ganymede, a Trojan prince, was chosen to be the cupbearer to her husband, Jupiter\u2014replacing Juno's daughter, Hebe. Juno proceeds to Aeolus, King of the Winds, and asks that he release the winds to stir up a storm in exchange for a bribe (Deiopea, the loveliest of all her sea nymphs, as a wife). Aeolus agrees to carry out Juno's orders (line 77, \"My task is / To fulfill your commands\"); the storm then devastates the fleet.\nNeptune takes notice: although he himself is no friend of the Trojans, he is infuriated by Juno's intrusion into his domain, and stills the winds and calms the waters, after making sure that the winds would not bother the Trojans again, lest they be punished more harshly than they were this time. The fleet takes shelter on the coast of Africa, where Aeneas rouses the spirits of his men, reassuring them that they have been through worse situations before. There, Aeneas' mother, Venus, in the form of a huntress very similar to the goddess Diana, encourages him and recounts to him the history of Carthage. Eventually, Aeneas ventures into the city, and in the temple of Juno he seeks and gains the favour of Dido, queen of the city. The city has only recently been founded by refugees from Tyre and will later become a great imperial rival and enemy to Rome.\nMeanwhile, Venus has her own plans. She goes to her son, Aeneas' half-brother Cupid, and tells him to imitate Ascanius (the son of Aeneas and his first wife Creusa). Thus disguised, Cupid goes to Dido and offers the gifts expected from a guest. As Dido cradles the boy during a banquet given in honour of the Trojans, Cupid secretly weakens her sworn fidelity to the soul of her late husband Sychaeus, who was murdered by her brother Pygmalion back in Tyre, by inciting fresh love for Aeneas.\nBook 2: Trojan Horse and sack of Troy.\nIn books 2 and 3, Aeneas recounts to Dido the events that occasioned the Trojans' arrival. Cunning Ulysses devised a way for Greek warriors to gain entry into the walled city of Troy by hiding in a large wooden horse. The Greeks pretended to sail away, leaving a warrior, Sinon, to mislead the Trojans into believing that the horse was an offering and that if it were taken into the city, the Trojans would be able to conquer Greece. The Trojan priest Laoco\u00f6n saw through the Greek plot and urged the horse's destruction, but his protests fell on deaf ears, so he hurled his spear at the horse. Then, in what would be seen by the Trojans as punishment from the gods, two serpents emerged from the sea and devoured Laoco\u00f6n, along with his two sons. The Trojans then took the horse inside the fortified walls, and after nightfall the armed Greeks emerged from it, opening the city's gates to allow the returned Greek army to slaughter the Trojans.\nIn a dream, Hector, the fallen Trojan prince, advised Aeneas to flee with his family. Aeneas awoke and saw with horror what was happening to his beloved city. At first he tried to fight the enemy, but soon he lost his comrades and was left alone to fend off the Greeks. He witnessed the murder of Priam by Achilles' son Pyrrhus. His mother, Venus, appeared to him and led him back to his house. Aeneas tells of his escape with his son, Ascanius, his wife Creusa, and his father, Anchises, after the occurrence of various omens (Ascanius' head catching fire without his being harmed, a clap of thunder and a shooting star). At the city gates, they notice that they have lost Creusa, and Aeneas has to re-enter the city in order to look for her. To his sorrow, he encounters only her ghost, who tells him that his destiny is to reach Hesperia, where kingship and a royal spouse await him.\nBook 3: Wanderings.\nAeneas continues his account to Dido by telling how, rallying the other survivors, he built a fleet of ships and made landfall at various locations in the Mediterranean: Thrace, where they find the last remains of a fellow Trojan, Polydorus; Delos, where Apollo tells them to leave and to find the land of their forefathers; Crete, which they believe to be that land, and where they build their city (Pergamea) and promptly desert it after a plague proves this is not the place for them; the Strophades, where they encounter the Harpy Celaeno, who tells them to leave her island and to look for Italy, though, she prophesies, they will not find it until hunger forces them to eat their tables; and Buthrotum. This last city had been built in an attempt to replicate Troy. In Buthrotum, Aeneas meets Andromache, the widow of Hector. She is still lamenting the loss of her valiant husband and beloved child. There, too, Aeneas sees and meets Helenus, one of Priam's sons, who has the gift of prophecy. Through him, Aeneas learns the destiny laid out for him: he is divinely advised to seek out the land of Italy (also known as \"Ausonia\" or \"Hesperia\"), where his descendants will not only prosper, but in time rule the entire known world. In addition, Helenus also bids him to go to the Sibyl in Cumae.\nHeading into the open sea, Aeneas leaves Buthrotum, rounds the south eastern tip of Italy and makes his way towards Sicily (Trinacria). There, they are caught in the whirlpool of Charybdis and driven out to sea. Soon they come ashore at the land of the Cyclopes. There they meet a Greek, Achaemenides, one of Ulysses' men, who has been left behind when his comrades escaped the cave of Polyphemus. They take Achaemenides on board and narrowly escape Polyphemus. Shortly after, at Drepanum, Aeneas' father Anchises dies of old age. Aeneas heads on (towards Italy) and gets deflected to Carthage (by the storm described in book 1). Here, Aeneas ends his account of his wanderings to Dido.\nBook 4: Fate of Queen Dido.\nDido realises that she has fallen in love with Aeneas. Juno seizes upon this opportunity to make a deal with Venus, Aeneas' mother, with the intention of distracting Aeneas from his destiny of founding a city in Italy. Aeneas is inclined to return Dido's love, and during a hunting expedition, a storm created by Juno drives them into a cave, where Juno presides over a ceremony in which natural phenomena imitate the symbols of a marriage ceremony. Dido interprets this as a marriage.\nFama (the personification of rumour) spreads the news of Aeneas and Dido's marriage, which eventually reaches King Iarbas. Iarbas, who also sought relations with Dido but was rejected, angrily prays to his father Jupiter to express his feeling that his worship of Jupiter has not earned him the rewards he deserves. As a result, Jupiter sends Mercury to remind Aeneas of his duty, leaving him no choice but to depart.\nWhen Aeneas clandestinely begins making preparations to leave at the behest of Mercury, Dido discovers Aeneas' intentions. Enraged and heartbroken, she accuses Aeneas of infidelity while also imploring him to stay. Aeneas responds by attempting to explain that his duty is important and that he does not leave of his own volition, but Dido is not satisfied. Ultimately, her heart broken, Dido commits suicide by stabbing herself upon a pyre with Aeneas' sword. Before dying, she predicts eternal strife between Aeneas' people and hers; \"rise up from my bones, avenging spirit\" (4.625, trans. Fitzgerald) is a possible invocation to Hannibal.\nBook 5: Sicily.\nLooking back from the deck of his ship, Aeneas sees the smoke of Dido's funeral pyre, and although he does not understand the exact reason behind it, he understands it as a bad omen, considering the angry madness of her love.\nHindered by bad weather from reaching Italy, the Trojans return to where they started at the beginning of book 1. Book 5 then takes place on Sicily and centres on the funeral games that Aeneas organises for the anniversary of his father's death. Aeneas organises celebratory games for the men\u2014a boat race, a foot race, a boxing match, and an archery contest. In all those contests, Aeneas is careful to reward winners and losers, showing his leadership qualities by not allowing antagonism even after foul play. Each of these contests comments on past events or prefigures future events: the boxing match, for instance, is \"a preview of the final encounter of Aeneas and Turnus\", and the dove, the target during the archery contest, is connected to the deaths of Polites and King Priam in Book 2 and that of Camilla in Book 11. Afterwards, Ascanius leads the boys in a military parade and mock battle, the Lusus Troiae\u2014a tradition he will teach the Latins while building the walls of Alba Longa.\nDuring these events, Juno, via her messenger Iris, who disguises herself as an old woman, incites the Trojan women to burn the fleet and prevent the Trojans from ever reaching Italy, but her plan is thwarted when Ascanius and Aeneas intervene. Aeneas prays to Jupiter to quench the fires, which the god does with a torrential rainstorm. An anxious Aeneas is comforted by a vision of his father, who tells him to go to the underworld to receive a vision of his and Rome's future. In return for safe passage to Italy, the gods, by order of Jupiter, will receive one of Aeneas' men as a sacrifice: Palinurus, who steers Aeneas' ship by night, is put to sleep by Somnus and falls overboard.\nBook 6: Underworld.\nAeneas, with the guidance of the Cumaean Sibyl, descends into the underworld. They pass by crowds of the dead by the banks of the river Acheron and are ferried across by Charon before passing by Cerberus, the three-headed guardian of the underworld. Then Aeneas is shown the fates of the wicked in Tartarus and is warned by the Sibyl to bow to the justice of the gods. He also meets the shade of Dido, who remains irreconcilable. He is then brought to green fields of Elysium. There he speaks with the spirit of his father and is offered a prophetic vision of the destiny of Rome.\nWar in Italy (books 7\u201312).\nBook 7: Arrival in Latium and outbreak of war.\nUpon returning to the land of the living, Aeneas leads the Trojans to settle in Latium, where King Latinus received oracles pointing towards the arrival of strangers and bidding him to marry his daughter Lavinia to the foreigners, and not to Turnus, the ruler of another native people, the Rutuli. Juno, unhappy with the Trojans' favourable situation, summons the fury Alecto from the underworld to stir up a war between the Trojans and the locals. Alecto incites Amata, the Queen of Latium and the wife of Latinus, to demand that Lavinia be married to noble Turnus, brings forth anger in Turnus which spurs him to war with the Trojans, and causes Ascanius to wound a revered deer during a hunt. Hence, although Aeneas wishes to avoid a war, hostilities break out. The book closes with a catalogue of Italic warriors.\nBook 8: Visit to Pallanteum, site of future Rome.\nGiven the impending war, Aeneas seeks help from the Tuscans, enemies of the Rutuli, after having been encouraged to do so in a dream by Tiberinus. At the place where Rome will be, he meets a friendly Greek, King Evander of Arcadia. His son Pallas agrees to join Aeneas and lead troops against the Rutuli. Venus urges her spouse Vulcan to create weapons for Aeneas, which she then presents to Aeneas as a gift. On the shield, the future history of Rome is depicted.\nBook 9: Turnus' siege of Trojan camp.\nMeanwhile, the Trojan camp is attacked by Turnus\u2014spurred on by Juno, who informs him that Aeneas is away from his camp\u2014and a midnight raid by the Trojans Nisus and Euryalus on Turnus' camp leads to their death. The next day, Turnus manages to breach the gates but is forced to retreat by jumping into the Tiber.\nBook 10: First battle.\nA council of the gods is held, in which Venus and Juno speak before Jupiter, and Aeneas returns to the besieged Trojan camp accompanied by his new Arcadian and Tuscan allies. In the ensuing battle many are slain\u2014notably Pallas, whom Evander has entrusted to Aeneas but who is killed by Turnus. Mezentius, Turnus' close associate, allows his son Lausus to be killed by Aeneas while he himself flees. He reproaches himself and faces Aeneas in single combat\u2014an honourable but essentially futile endeavour leading to his death.\nBook 11: Armistice and battle with Camilla.\nAfter a short break in which the funeral ceremony for Pallas takes place, the war continues. Another notable native, Camilla, an Amazon character and virgin devoted to Diana, fights bravely but is killed, poisoned by the coward Arruns, who in turn is struck dead by Diana's sentinel Opis.\nBook 12: Final battle and duel of Aeneas and Turnus.\nSingle combat is proposed between Aeneas and Turnus, but Aeneas is so obviously superior to Turnus that the Rutuli, urged on by Turnus' divine sister, Juturna\u2014who in turn is instigated by Juno\u2014break the truce. Aeneas is injured by an arrow but is soon healed with the help of his mother Venus and returns to the battle. Turnus and Aeneas dominate the battle on opposite wings, but when Aeneas makes a daring attack at the city of Latium (causing the queen of Latium to hang herself in despair), he forces Turnus into single combat once more. In the duel, Turnus' strength deserts him as he tries to hurl a rock, and Aeneas' spear goes through his thigh. As Turnus is on his knees, begging for his life, the epic ends with Aeneas initially tempted to obey Turnus' pleas to spare his life, but then killing him in rage when he sees that Turnus is wearing Aeneas' friend Pallas' belt over his shoulder as a trophy.\nReception.\nCritics of the \"Aeneid\" focus on a variety of issues. The tone of the poem as a whole is a particular matter of debate; some see the poem as ultimately pessimistic and politically subversive to the Augustan regime, while others view it as a celebration of the new imperial dynasty. Virgil makes use of the symbolism of the Augustan regime, and some scholars see strong associations between Augustus and Aeneas, the one as founder and the other as re-founder of Rome. A strong teleology, or drive towards a climax, has been detected in the poem. The \"Aeneid\" is full of prophecies about the future of Rome, the deeds of Augustus, his ancestors, and famous Romans, and the Carthaginian Wars; the shield of Aeneas even depicts Augustus' victory at Actium in 31 BC. A further focus of study is the character of Aeneas. As the protagonist of the poem, Aeneas seems to constantly waver between his emotions and commitment to his prophetic duty to found Rome; critics note the breakdown of Aeneas' emotional control in the last sections of the poem where the \"pious\" and \"righteous\" Aeneas mercilessly slaughters the Latin warrior Turnus.\nThe \"Aeneid\" appears to have been a great success. Virgil is said to have recited Books 2, 4 and 6 to Augustus; the mention of her son, Marcellus, in book 6 apparently caused Augustus' sister Octavia to faint. The poem was unfinished when Virgil died in 19 BC.\nVirgil's death, and editing.\nAccording to tradition, Virgil traveled to Greece around 19 BC to revise the \"Aeneid\". After meeting Augustus in Athens and deciding to return home, Virgil caught a fever while visiting a town near Megara. Virgil crossed to Italy by ship, weakened with disease, and died in Brundisium harbour on 21 September 19\u00a0BC, leaving a wish that the manuscript of the \"Aeneid\" was to be burned. Augustus ordered Virgil's literary executors, Lucius Varius Rufus and Plotius Tucca, to disregard that wish, instead ordering the \"Aeneid\" to be published with as few editorial changes as possible.\nHistory.\nThe \"Aeneid\" was written in a time of major political and social change in Rome, with the fall of the Roman Republic and the Final War of the Roman Republic having torn through society and many Romans' faith in the \"Greatness of Rome\" severely faltering. However, the new emperor, Augustus Caesar, began to institute a new era of prosperity and peace, specifically through the re-introduction of traditional Roman moral values. The \"Aeneid\" was seen as reflecting this aim, by depicting the heroic Aeneas as a man devoted and loyal to his country and its prominence, rather than his own personal gains. In addition, the \"Aeneid\" gives mythic legitimisation to the rule of Julius Caesar and, by extension, to his adopted son Augustus, by immortalising the tradition that renamed Aeneas' son, Ascanius (called Ilus from \"Ilium\", meaning Troy), \"Iulus\", thus making him an ancestor of the \"gens Julia\", the family of Julius Caesar, and many other great imperial descendants as part of the prophecy given to him in the Underworld. (The meter shows that the name \"Iulus\" is pronounced as three syllables, not as \"Julus\".)\nThe perceived deficiency of any account of Aeneas' marriage to Lavinia or his founding of the Roman race led some writers, such as the 15th-century Italian poet Maffeo Vegio (through his \"Thirteenth Book of the Aeneid\" widely printed in the Renaissance), Pier Candido Decembrio (whose attempt was never completed), Claudio Salvucci (in his 1994 epic poem \"The Laviniad\"), and Ursula K. Le Guin (in her 2008 novel \"Lavinia\") to compose their own supplements.\nDespite the polished and complex nature of the \"Aeneid\" (legend stating that Virgil wrote only three lines of the poem each day), the number of half-complete lines and the abrupt ending are generally seen as evidence that Virgil died before he could finish the work. Some legends state that Virgil, fearing that he would die before he had properly revised the poem, gave instructions to friends (including the current emperor, Augustus) that the \"Aeneid\" should be burned upon his death, owing to its unfinished state and because he had come to dislike one of the sequences in Book VIII, in which Venus and Vulcan made love, for its nonconformity to Roman moral virtues. The friends did not comply with Virgil's wishes and Augustus himself ordered that they be disregarded. After minor modifications, the \"Aeneid\" was published. Because it was composed and preserved in writing rather than orally, the text exhibits less variation than other classical epics.\nStyle.\nAs with other classical Latin poetry, the meter is based on the length of syllables rather than the stress, though the interplay of meter and stress is also important. Virgil also incorporated such poetic devices as alliteration, onomatopoeia, synecdoche, and assonance. Furthermore, he uses personification, metaphor, and simile in his work, usually to add drama and tension to the scene. An example of a simile can be found in book II when Aeneas is compared to a shepherd who stood on the high top of a rock unaware of what is going on around him. It can be seen that just as the shepherd is a protector of his sheep, so too is Aeneas to his people.\nAs was the rule in classical antiquity, an author's style was seen as an expression of his personality and character. Virgil's Latin has been praised for its evenness, subtlety and dignity.\nStructure.\nThe \"Aeneid\", like other classical epics, is written in dactylic hexameters: each line consists of six metrical feet made up of dactyls (one long syllable followed by two short syllables) and spondees (two long syllables). This epic consists of twelve books, and the narrative is broken up into three sections of four books each, respectively addressing Dido; the Trojans' arrival in Italy; and the war with the Latins. Each book has roughly 700\u2013900 lines. The \"Aeneid\" comes to an abrupt ending, and scholars have speculated that Virgil died before he could finish the poem.\nThemes.\n\"Pietas\".\nThe Roman ideal of \"pietas\" (\"piety, dutiful respect\"), which can be loosely translated from the Latin as a selfless sense of duty toward one's\nfilial, religious, and societal obligations, was a crux of ancient Roman morality. Throughout the \"Aeneid\", Aeneas serves as the embodiment of\n\"pietas\", with the phrase \"pious Aeneas\" occurring 20 times throughout the poem, thereby fulfilling his capacity as the father of the Roman people. For instance, in Book 2 Aeneas describes how he carried his father Anchises from the burning city of Troy: \"No help / Or hope of help existed. / So I resigned myself, picked up my father, / And turned my face toward the mountain range.\" Furthermore, Aeneas ventures into the underworld, thereby fulfilling Anchises' wishes. His father's gratitude is presented in the text by the following lines: \"Have you at last come, has that loyalty / Your father counted on conquered the journey?\"\nHowever, Aeneas' \"pietas\" extends beyond his devotion to his father: we also see several examples of his religious fervour. Aeneas is consistently subservient to the gods, even in actions opposed to his own desires, as he responds to one such divine command, \"I sail to Italy not of my own free will.\"\nIn addition to his religious and familial \"pietas\", Aeneas also displays fervent patriotism and devotion to his people, particularly in a military capacity. For instance, as he and his followers leave Troy, Aeneas swears that he will \"take up / The combat once again. We shall not all / Die this day unavenged.\"\nAeneas is a symbol of \"pietas\" in all of its forms, serving as a moral paragon to whom a Roman should aspire.\nDivine intervention.\nOne of the most recurring themes in the \"Aeneid\" is that of divine intervention. Throughout the poem, the gods are constantly influencing the main characters and trying to change and impact the outcome, regardless of the fate that they all know will occur. For example, Juno comes down and acts as a phantom Aeneas to drive Turnus away from the real Aeneas and all of his rage from the death of Pallas. Even though Juno knows in the end that Aeneas will triumph over Turnus, she does all she can to delay and avoid this outcome.\nDivine intervention occurs multiple times, in Book 4 especially. Aeneas falls in love with Dido, delaying his ultimate fate of travelling to Italy. However, it is actually the gods who inspired the love, as Juno plots:\nDido and the Trojan captain [will come]\nTo one same cavern. I shall be on hand,\nAnd if I can be certain you are willing,\nThere I shall marry them and call her his.\nA wedding, this will be.\nJuno is speaking to Venus, making an agreement and influencing the lives and emotions of both Dido and Aeneas. Later in the same book, Jupiter steps in and restores what is the true fate and path for Aeneas, sending Mercury down to Aeneas' dreams, telling him that he must travel to Italy and leave his new-found lover. As Aeneas later pleads with Dido:\nThe gods' interpreter, sent by Jove himself \u2013\nI swear it by your head and mine \u2013 has brought\nCommands down through the racing winds!...\nI sail for Italy not of my own free will.\nSeveral of the gods try to intervene against the powers of fate, even though they know what the eventual outcome will be. The interventions are really just distractions to continue the conflict and postpone the inevitable. If the gods represent humans, just as the human characters engage in conflicts and power struggles, so too do the gods.\nFate.\nFate, described as a preordained destiny that men and gods have to follow, is a major theme in the \"Aeneid\". One example is when Aeneas is reminded of his fate through Jupiter and Mercury while he is falling in love with Dido. Mercury urges, \"Think of your expectations of your heir, / Iulus, to whom the whole Italian realm, the land / Of Rome, are due.\" Mercury is referring to Aeneas' preordained fate to found Rome, as well as Rome's preordained fate to rule the world:\nHe was to be ruler of Italy,\nPotential empire, armorer of war;\nTo father men from Teucer's noble blood\nAnd bring the whole world under law's dominion.\nThere is a marked difference between fate and divine intervention, as even though the gods might remind mortals of their eventual fate, the gods themselves are not in control of it. For example, the opening lines of the poem specify that Aeneas \"came to Italy by destiny\", but is also harassed by the separate force of \"baleful Juno in her sleepless rage\". Even though Juno might intervene, Aeneas' fate is set in stone and cannot be changed.\nLater in Book 6, when Aeneas visits the underworld, his father Anchises introduces him to the larger fate of the Roman people, as contrasted against his own personal fate to found Rome:\nSo raptly, everywhere, father and son\nWandered the airy plain and viewed it all.\nAfter Anchises had conducted him\nTo every region and had fired his love\nOf glory in the years to come, he spoke\nOf wars that he might fight, of Laurentines,\nAnd of Latinus' city, then of how\nHe might avoid or bear each toil to come.\nViolence and conflict.\nFrom the very beginning of the \"Aeneid\", violence and conflict are used as a means of survival and conquest. Aeneas' voyage is caused by the Trojan War and the destruction of Troy. Aeneas describes to Dido in Book 2 the massive amount of destruction that occurs after the Greeks sneak into Troy. He recalls that he asks his men to \"defend / A city lost in flames. Come, let us die, / We'll make a rush into the thick of it.\" This is one of the first demonstrations of the way in which violence begets violence: even though the Trojans know they have lost the battle, they continue to fight for their country.\nThis violence continues as Aeneas makes his journey. Dido kills herself in order to end and escape her worldly problem: being heartbroken over the departure of Aeneas and now left alone, surrounded by violent rulers who desire her and her throne. Queen Dido's suicide is a double edged sword. While releasing herself from the burden of her pain through violence, her last words implore her people to view Aeneas' people with hate for all eternity:\nThis is my last cry, as my last blood flows.\nThen, O my Tyrians, besiege with hate\nHis progeny and all his race to come:\nMake this your offering to my dust. No love,\nNo pact must be between our peoples.\nFurthermore, her people, hearing of their queen's death, have only one avenue on which to direct the blame: the already-departed Trojans. Thus, Dido's request of her people and her people's only recourse for closure align in their mutual hate for Aeneas and his Trojans. In effect, Dido's violent suicide leads to the violent nature of the later relationship between Carthage and Rome.\nFinally, when Aeneas arrives in Latium, conflict inevitably arises. Juno sends Alecto, one of the Furies, to cause Turnus to go against Aeneas. In the ensuing battles, Turnus kills Pallas, who is supposed to be under Aeneas' protection. This act of violence causes Aeneas to be consumed with fury. Although Turnus asks for mercy in their final encounter, when Aeneas sees that Turnus has taken Pallas' sword belt, Aeneas proclaims:\nYou in your plunder, torn from one of mine,\nShall I be robbed of you? This wound will come\nFrom Pallas: Pallas makes this offering\nAnd from your criminal blood exacts his due.\nThis final act of violence shows how Turnus' violence\u2014the act of killing Pallas\u2014inevitably leads to more violence and his own death.\nIt is possible that the recurring theme of violence in the \"Aeneid\" is a subtle commentary on the bloody violence contemporary readers would have just experienced during the Late Republican civil wars. The \"Aeneid\" potentially explores whether the violence of the civil wars was necessary to establish a lasting peace under Augustus, or whether it would just lead to more violence in the future.\nPropaganda.\nWritten during the reign of Augustus, the \"Aeneid\" presents the hero Aeneas as a strong and powerful leader. The favourable representation of Aeneas parallels Augustus in that it portrays his reign in a progressive and admirable light, and allows Augustus to be positively associated with the portrayal of Aeneas. Although Virgil's patron Maecenas was obviously not Augustus himself, he was still a high figure within Augustus' administration and could have personally benefitted from representing Aeneas in a positive light.\nIn the \"Aeneid\", Aeneas is portrayed as the singular hope for the rebirth of the Trojan people. Charged with the preservation of his people by divine authority, Aeneas is symbolic of Augustus' own accomplishments in establishing order after the long period of chaos of the Roman civil wars. Augustus as the light of saviour and the last hope of the Roman people is a parallel to Aeneas as the saviour of the Trojans. This parallel functions as propaganda in support of Augustus, as it depicts the Trojan people, future Romans themselves, as uniting behind a single leader who will lead them out of ruin:\nNew refugees in a great crowd: men and women\nGathered for exile, young-pitiful people\nComing from every quarter, minds made up,\nWith their belongings, for whatever lands\nI'd lead them to by sea.\nLater in Book 6, Aeneas travels to the underworld where he sees his father Anchises, who tells him of his own destiny as well as that of the Roman people. Anchises describes how Aeneas' descendant Romulus will found the great city of Rome, which will eventually be ruled by Caesar Augustus:\nTurn your two eyes\nThis way and see this people, your own Romans.\nHere is Caesar, and all the line of Iulus,\nAll who shall one day pass under the dome\nOf the great sky: this is the man, this one,\nOf whom so often you have heard the promise,\nCaesar Augustus, son of the deified,\nWho shall bring once again an Age of Gold\nTo Latium, to the land where Saturn reigned\nIn early times.\nVirgil writes about the fated future of Lavinium, the city that Aeneas will found, which will in turn lead directly to the golden reign of Augustus. Virgil is using a form of literary propaganda to demonstrate the Augustan regime's destiny to bring glory and peace to Rome. Rather than use Aeneas indirectly as a positive parallel to Augustus as in other parts of the poem, Virgil outright praises the emperor in Book 6, referring to Augustus as a harbinger for the glory of Rome and new levels of prosperity.\nAllegory.\nThe poem abounds with smaller and greater allegories. Two of the debated allegorical sections pertain to the exit from the underworld and to Pallas' belt.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;There are two gates of Sleep, one said to be of horn, whereby the true shades pass with ease, the other \"all white ivory agleam without a flaw, and yet false dreams are sent\" through this one by the ghost to the upper world. Anchises now, his last instructions given, took son and Sibyl and let them \"go by the Ivory Gate\".\u2014\u200a\nAeneas' leaving the underworld through the gate of false dreams has been variously interpreted: one suggestion is that the passage simply refers to the time of day at which Aeneas returned to the world of the living; another is that it implies that all of Aeneas' actions in the remainder of the poem are somehow \"false\". In an extension of the latter interpretation, it has been suggested that Virgil is conveying that the history of the world since the foundation of Rome is but a lie. Other scholars claim that Virgil is establishing that the theological implications of the preceding scene (an apparent system of reincarnation) are not to be taken as literal.\nThe second section in question is\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Then to his glance appeared the accurst swordbelt surmounting Turnus' shoulder, shining with its familiar studs\u2014the strap Young Pallas wore when Turnus wounded him and left him dead upon the field; now Turnus bore that enemy token on his shoulder\u2014enemy still. For when the sight came home to him, Aeneas \"raged\" at the relic of his anguish worn by this man as trophy. \"Blazing up and terrible in his anger\", he called out: \"You in your plunder, torn from one of mine, shall I be robbed of you? This wound will come from Pallas: Pallas makes this offering, and from your criminal blood exacts his due.\" \"He sank his blade in fury\" in Turnus' chest\u00a0...\u2014\u200a\nThis section has been interpreted to mean that for the entire passage of the poem, Aeneas, who symbolises \"pietas\" (piety or morality), in a moment becomes \"furor\" (fury), thus destroying what is essentially the primary theme of the poem itself. Many have argued over these two sections. Some claim that Virgil meant to change them before he died, while others find that the location of the two passages, at the very end of the so-called Volume I (Books 1\u20136, the \"Odyssey\"), and Volume II (Books 7\u201312, the \"Iliad\"), and their short length, which contrasts with the lengthy nature of the poem, are evidence that Virgil placed them purposefully there.\nInfluence.\nThe \"Aeneid\" is a cornerstone of the Western canon, and early (at least by the 2nd century AD) became one of the essential elements of a Latin education, usually required to be memorised. Even after the decline of the Roman Empire, it \"remained central to a Latin education\". In Latin-Christian culture, the \"Aeneid\" was one of the canonical texts, subjected to commentary as a philological and educational study, with the most complete commentary having been written by the 4th-century grammarian Maurus Servius Honoratus. It was widely held to be the pinnacle of Latin literature, much in the same way that the \"Iliad\" was seen to be supreme in Greek literature.\nThe strong influence of the \"Aeneid\" has been identified in the development of European vernacular literatures\u2014some English works that show its influence being \"Beowulf\", Layamon's \"Brut\" (through the source text \"Historia Regum Britanniae\"), \"The Faerie Queene\", and John Milton's \"Paradise Lost\". The Italian poet Dante Alighieri was himself profoundly influenced by the \"Aeneid\", so much so that his magnum opus \"The Divine Comedy\", itself widely considered central to the western canon, includes a number of quotations from and allusions to the \"Aeneid\" and features the author Virgil as a major character\u2014the guide of Dante through the realms of the Inferno and Purgatorio. Another continental work displaying the influence of the \"Aeneid\" is the 16th-century Portuguese epic \"Os Lus\u00edadas\", written by Lu\u00eds de Cam\u00f5es and dealing with Vasco da Gama's voyage to India.\nThe importance of Latin education itself was paramount in Western culture: \"from 1600 to 1900, the Latin school was at the centre of European education, wherever it was found\"; within that Latin school, Virgil was taught at the advanced level and, in 19th-century England, special editions of Virgil were awarded to students who distinguished themselves. In the United States, Virgil and specifically the \"Aeneid\" were taught in the fourth year of a Latin sequence, at least until the 1960s; the current (2011) Advanced Placement curriculum in Latin continues to assign a central position to the poem: \"The AP Latin: Virgil Exam is designed to test the student's ability to read, translate, understand, analyze, and interpret the lines of the \"Aeneid\" that appear on the course syllabus in Latin.\"\nMany phrases from this poem entered the Latin language, much as passages from William Shakespeare and Alexander Pope have entered the English language. One example is from Aeneas' reaction to a painting of the sack of Troy: \"Sunt lacrimae rerum et mentem mortalia tangunt\"\u2014\"These are the tears of things, and our mortality cuts to the heart\" (\"Aeneid\" I, 462). The influence is also visible in very modern work: Brian Friel's \"Translations\" (a play written in the 1980s, set in 19th-century Ireland), makes references to the classics throughout and ends with a passage from the \"Aeneid\":\n\"Urbs antiqua fuit\"\u2014there was an ancient city which, 'tis said, Juno loved above all the lands. And it was the goddess' aim and cherished hope that here should be the capital of all nations\u2014should the fates perchance allow that. Yet in truth she discovered that a race was springing from Trojan blood to overthrow some day these Tyrian towers\u2014a people \"late regem belloque superbum\"\u2014kings of broad realms and proud in war who would come forth for Libya's downfall.\nEnglish translations.\nThe first full and faithful rendering of the poem in an Anglic language is the Scots translation by Gavin Douglas\u2014his \"Eneados\", completed in 1513, which also included Maffeo Vegio's supplement. Even in the 20th century, Ezra Pound considered this still to be the best \"Aeneid\" translation, praising the \"richness and fervour\" of its language and its hallmark fidelity to the original. The English translation by the 17th-century poet John Dryden is another important version. Most classic translations, including both Douglas and Dryden, employ a rhyme scheme; most more modern attempts do not.\nRecent English verse translations include those by Patric Dickinson (1961); British Poet Laureate Cecil Day-Lewis (1963), who strove to render Virgil's original hexameter line; Allen Mandelbaum (honoured by a 1973 National Book Award); Library of Congress Poet Laureate Robert Fitzgerald (1981); David West (1990); Stanley Lombardo (2005); Robert Fagles (2006); Frederick Ahl (2007); Sarah Ruden (2008); Barry B. Powell (2015); David Ferry (2017); Len Krisak (2020); Shadi Bartsch (2021); as well as Scott McGill and Susannah Wright (2025).\nThere have also been partial translations, such as those by Henry Howard, Earl of Surrey (Book 2 and Book 4), and Seamus Heaney (Book 6).\nAdaptations.\nOne of the first operas based on the story of the \"Aeneid\" was the English composer Henry Purcell's \"Dido and Aeneas\" (1688). The opera is famous for its aria \"Dido's Lament\" ('When I am laid in earth'), of which the first line of the melody is inscribed on the wall by the door of the Purcell Room, a concert hall in London.\nThe story of the \"Aeneid\" was made into the grand opera \"Les Troyens\" (1856\u20131858) by the French composer Hector Berlioz.\nThe \"Aeneid\" was the basis for the 1962 Italian film \"The Avenger\" and the 1971\u20131972 television serial \"Eneide\".\nIn the musical \"Spring Awakening\", based on the play of the same title by Frank Wedekind, schoolboys study the Latin text, and the first verse of Book 1 is incorporated into the number \"All That's Known\".\nUrsula Le Guin's 2008 novel \"Lavinia\" is a free prose retelling of the last six books of the \"Aeneid\" narrated by and centred on Aeneas' Latin wife Lavinia, a minor character in the epic poem. It carries the action forward to the crowning of Aeneas' younger son Silvius as king of Latium.\nA 17th-century popular broadside ballad also appears to recount events from books 1\u20134 of the \"Aeneid,\" focusing mostly on the relationship between Aeneas and Dido. The ballad, \"The Wandering Prince of Troy\", presents many similar elements as Virgil's epic, but alters Dido's final sentiments toward Aeneas, as well as presenting an interesting end for Aeneas himself.\nParodies and travesties.\nA number of parodies and travesties of the \"Aeneid\" have been made.\nFootnotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

AD 69 \u2013 after AD 122)\nGaius Suetonius Tranquillus (), commonly referred to as Suetonius ( ; c.\u2009AD 69 \u2013 after AD 122), was a Roman historian who wrote during the early Imperial era of the Roman Empire. His most important surviving work is \"De vita Caesarum\", commonly known in English as \"The Twelve Caesars\", a set of biographies of 12 successive Roman rulers from Julius Caesar to Domitian. Other works by Suetonius concerned the daily life of Rome, politics, oratory, and the lives of famous writers, including poets, historians, and grammarians. A few of these books have partially survived, but many have been lost.\nLife.\nGaius Suetonius Tranquillus was probably born about AD 69, a date deduced from his remarks describing himself as a \"young man\" 20 years after Nero's death. His place of birth is disputed, but most scholars place it in Hippo Regius (the modern Annaba), at the time a small north African town in Numidia, in modern-day Algeria. It is certain that Suetonius came from a family of moderate social position, that his father, Suetonius Laetus, was a tribune belonging to the equestrian order (\"tribunus angusticlavius\") in Legio XIII Gemina, and that Suetonius was educated when schools of rhetoric flourished in Rome.\nSuetonius was a close friend of senator and letter-writer Pliny the Younger. Pliny describes him as \"quiet and studious, a man dedicated to writing\". Pliny helped him buy a small property and interceded with the Emperor Trajan to grant Suetonius immunities usually granted to a father of three, the \"ius trium liberorum\", because his marriage was childless. Through Pliny, Suetonius came into favour with Trajan and Hadrian. Suetonius may have served on Pliny's staff when Pliny was imperial governor (\"legatus Augusti pro praetore\") of Bithynia and Pontus (northern Asia Minor) between 110 and 112. Under Trajan he served as secretary of studies (precise functions are uncertain) and director of Imperial archives. Under Hadrian, he became the emperor's secretary. According to the controversial and factually loose \"Historia Augusta\", Hadrian later dismissed Suetonius for an affair with the empress Vibia Sabina.\nWorks.\nThe Twelve Caesars.\nSuetonius is mainly remembered as the author of \"De Vita Caesarum\"\u2014translated as \"The Life of the Caesars\", although a more common English title is \"The Lives of the Twelve Caesars\" or simply \"The Twelve Caesars\"\u2014his only extant work except for the brief biographies and other fragments noted below. \"The Twelve Caesars\", probably written in Hadrian's time, is a collective biography of the Roman Empire's first leaders, Julius Caesar (the first few chapters are missing), Augustus, Tiberius, Caligula, Claudius, Nero, Galba, Otho, Vitellius, Vespasian, Titus and Domitian.

{"id": "37325", "revid": "31322263", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37325", "title": "Marcus Junius Brutus", "text": "Roman politician and assassin of Julius Caesar (85\u201342 BC)\nMarcus Junius Brutus (; ; c. 85 BC \u2013 23 October 42 BC) was a Roman politician, orator, and the most famous of the assassins of Julius Caesar. After being adopted by a relative, he used the name Quintus Servilius Caepio Brutus, which was retained as his legal name. He is often referred to simply as Brutus.\nEarly in his political career, Brutus opposed Pompey, who was responsible for Brutus' father's death. He also was close to Caesar. However, Caesar's attempts to evade accountability in the law courts put him at greater odds with his opponents in the Roman elite and the senate. Brutus eventually came to oppose Caesar and sided with Pompey against Caesar's forces during the ensuing civil war (49\u201345 BC). Pompey was defeated at the Battle of Pharsalus in 48, after which Brutus surrendered to Caesar, who granted him amnesty.\nWith Caesar's increasingly monarchical and autocratic behaviour after the civil war, several senators who later called themselves \"liberatores\" (liberators) plotted to assassinate him. Brutus took a leading role in the assassination, which was carried out successfully on the Ides of March (15 March) of 44 BC. In a settlement between the \"liberatores\" and the Caesarians, an amnesty was granted to the assassins while Caesar's acts were upheld for two years.\nPopular unrest forced Brutus and his brother-in-law, fellow assassin Gaius Cassius Longinus, to leave Rome in April 44. After a complex political realignment, Octavian \u2013 Caesar's adopted son \u2013 made himself consul and, with his colleague, passed a law retroactively making Brutus and the other conspirators murderers. This led to a second civil war, in which Mark Antony and Octavian fought the \"liberatores\" led by Brutus and Cassius. The Caesarians decisively defeated the outnumbered armies of Brutus and Cassius at the two battles at Philippi in October 42. After the defeat, Brutus took his own life.\nHis name has become a synonym and byword for \"betrayal\" or \"traitor\" in most languages of Europe. His condemnation for betrayal of Caesar, his friend and benefactor, is perhaps rivalled only by the name of Judas Iscariot, with whom he is portrayed in Dante Alighieri's \"Inferno\". He also has been praised in various narratives, both ancient and modern, as a virtuous and committed republican who fought \u2013 however futilely \u2013 for freedom and against tyranny.\nEarly life.\nMarcus Junius Brutus belonged to the illustrious plebeian gens Junia. Its semi-legendary founder was Lucius Junius Brutus, who played a pivotal role during the overthrow of Tarquinius Superbus, the last Roman king, and was afterward one of the two first consuls of the new Roman Republic in 509 BC, taking the opportunity also to have the people swear an oath never to have another king in Rome.\nBrutus was born late in 85\u00a0BC. His homonymous father was tribune of the plebs in 83\u00a0BC, but he was targeted by Sulla during his proscription. He later served as legate in the rebellion of Marcus Aemilius Lepidus and was killed by Pompey in 77. He had married Servilia of the Servilii Caepiones who was the half-sister of Cato the Younger, and later Julius Caesar's mistress. Some ancient sources refer to the possibility of Caesar being Brutus's real father, despite Caesar being only fifteen years old when Brutus was born. Ancient historians were sceptical of this possibility, and the theory is largely rejected by modern scholars as chronologically improbable.\nAs a result of his father's proscription, Brutus could not start a political career. Around 59, this restriction was lifted by Brutus's posthumous adoption by one of his relatives, Quintus Servilius Caepio; he was therefore known officially as Quintus Servilius Caepio Brutus, though he hardly used his legal name. In 59, when Caesar was consul, Brutus also was implicated by Lucius Vettius in the Vettius affair as a member of a conspiracy plotting to assassinate Pompey in the forum. Vettius was detained for admitting possession of a weapon within the city, and quickly changed this story the next day, dropping Brutus's name from his accusations.\nBrutus's first appearance in public life was as an assistant to Cato, when the latter was appointed by the senate acting at the bequest of Publius Clodius Pulcher, as governor of Cyprus in 58. According to Plutarch, Brutus was instrumental in assisting the administration of the province (specifically by converting treasure of the former king of the island into usable money); his role in administering the province, however, has \"almost certainly been exaggerated\".\n\"Triumvir monetalis\".\nIn 54\u00a0BC, Brutus served as \"triumvir monetalis\", one of the three men appointed annually for producing coins, even though only another colleague is known: Quintus Pompeius Rufus. Moneyers in Brutus's day frequently issued coins commemorating their ancestors; Pompeius Rufus thus put the portraits of his two grandfathers (the dictator Sulla and Pompeius Rufus) on his denarii. Brutus, like his colleague, designed a denarius with the portraits of his paternal ancestor Lucius Junius Brutus and maternal ancestor Gaius Servilius Ahala, both of whom were widely recognised in the late Republic as defenders of liberty (for, respectively, expelling the kings and killing Spurius Maelius). He also made a second type featuring Libertas, the goddess of liberty, and Lucius Brutus. These coins show Brutus's admiration for the tyrannicides of the early republic, already mentioned by Cicero as early as 59\u00a0BC. In addition, Brutus's denarii and their message against tyranny participated in the propaganda against Pompey and his ambitions to rule alone or become dictator.\nCilicia.\nBrutus married Appius Claudius Pulcher's daughter Claudia, likely in 54 during Pulcher's consulship. He was elected as quaestor (and automatically enrolled in the senate) in 53. Brutus then travelled with his father-in-law to Cilicia, likely as proquaestor, during the latter's proconsulship in the next year. While in Cilicia, he spent some time as a money-lender, which was discovered two years later when Cicero was appointed proconsul between 51 and 50\u00a0BC. Brutus asked Cicero to help collect two debts which Brutus had made: one to Ariobarzanes, the king of Cappadocia, and one to the town of Salamis. Brutus's loan to Ariobarzanes was bundled with a loan also made by Pompey and both received some repayment on the debt.\nThe loan to Salamis was more complex: officially, the loan was made by two of Brutus's friends, who requested repayment at 48 per cent per annum, which was far in excess of Cicero's previously imposed interest cap of 12 per cent. The loan dated back to 56, shortly after Brutus returned to Rome from Cyprus. Salamis had sent a delegation asking to borrow money, but under the \"lex Gabinia\" it was illegal for Romans to lend to provincials in the capital, but Brutus was able to find \"friends\" to loan this money on his behalf, which was approved under his influence in the senate. Because the \"lex Gabinia\" also invalidated such contracts, Brutus also had his contract \u2013 officially his friends' contract \u2013 confirmed by the senate. One of Brutus's friends in whose name the debt was officially issued, Marcus Scaptius, was in Cilicia during Cicero's proconsulship using force to coerce repayment, which Cicero stopped; Cicero, not seeking to endanger his friendship with Brutus, but also disappointed and angry at Brutus's mischaracterisation of the loan and the exorbitant interest rate attached, was persuaded by Scaptius to defer a decision on the loan to the next governor.\nOpposition to Pompey.\nIn 52, in the aftermath of the death of his uncle-in-law, Publius Clodius Pulcher (brother of his wife's father), he wrote a pamphlet, \"De Dictatura Pompei\" (On the Dictatorship of Pompey), opposing demands for Pompey to be made dictator, writing \"it is better to rule no one than to be another man's slave, for one can live honourably without power but to live as a slave is impossible\". He was in this episode more radical than Cato the Younger, who supported Pompey's elevation as sole consul for 52, saying \"any government at all is better than no government\". Soon after Pompey was made sole consul, Pompey passed the \"lex Pompeia de vi\", which targeted Titus Annius Milo, for which Cicero would write a speech \"pro Milone\". Brutus also wrote for Milo, writing (a now lost) \"pro T Annio Milone\", in which he connected Milo's killing of Clodius explicitly to the welfare of the state and possibly also criticising what he saw as Pompey's abuses of power. This speech or pamphlet was very well received and positively viewed by later teachers of rhetoric.\nIn the late 50s, Brutus was elected as a \"pontifex\", one of the public priests in charge of supervising the calendar and maintaining Rome's peaceful relationship with the gods. It is likely that Caesar supported his election. Caesar had previously invited Brutus, after his quaestorship, to join him as a legate in Gaul, but Brutus declined, instead going with Appius Pulcher to Cilicia, possibly out of loyalty thereto. During the 50s, Brutus also was involved in some major trials, working alongside famous advocates like Cicero and Quintus Hortensius. In 50, he \u2013 with Pompey and Hortensius \u2013 played a significant role in defending Brutus's father-in-law Appius Claudius from charges of treason and electoral malpractice.\nIn the political crisis running up to Caesar's Civil War in 49, Brutus's views are mostly unknown. While he did oppose Pompey until 52, Brutus may have simply taken a tactical silence. Cicero's letters also indicate that Brutus may have been courted by Caesar \u2013 who is said to have spoken about avenging the death of Brutus's father \u2013 in the run-up to the civil war.\nCaesar's civil war.\nWhen Caesar's Civil War broke out in January 49 BC between Pompey and Caesar, Brutus faced a choice between one or the other. Pompey and his allies fled the city before Caesar's army arrived in March. Brutus decided to support his father's killer, Pompey; this choice may have had mostly to do with Brutus's closest allies \u2013 Appius Claudius, Cato, Cicero, etc. \u2013 also all joining Pompey. He did not, however, immediately join Pompey, instead travelling to Cilicia as legate for Publius Sestius before joining Pompey in winter 49 or spring 48.\nIt is not known whether Brutus fought in the ensuing battles at Dyrrhachium and Pharsalus. Plutarch says that Caesar ordered his officers to take Brutus prisoner if he gave himself up voluntarily, but to leave him alone and do him no harm if he persisted in fighting against capture. After the massive Pompeian defeat at Pharsalus on 9 August 48, Brutus fled through marshland to Larissa, where he wrote to Caesar, who welcomed him graciously into his camp. Plutarch also implies that Brutus told Caesar of Pompey's withdrawal plans to Egypt, but this is unlikely, as Brutus was not present when Pompey's decision to go to Egypt was made.\nWhile Caesar followed Pompey to Alexandria in 48\u201347, Brutus worked to effect a reconciliation between various Pompeians and Caesar. He arrived back in Rome in December 47. Caesar appointed Brutus as governor (likely as \"legatus pro praetore\") for Cisalpine Gaul while he left for Africa in pursuit of Cato and Metellus Scipio. After Cato's suicide following defeat at the battle of Thapsus on 6 April 46, Brutus was one of Cato's eulogisers writing a pamphlet entitled \"Cato\" in which he reflected positively both on Cato's life while highlighting Caesar's \"clementia\".\nAfter Caesar's last battle against the republican remnant in March 45, Brutus divorced his wife Claudia in June and promptly remarried his cousin Porcia, Cato's daughter, late in the same month. According to Cicero the marriage caused a semi-scandal as Brutus failed to state a valid reason for his divorce from Claudia other than he wished to marry Porcia. Brutus's reasons for marrying Porcia are unclear, he may have been in love or it could have been a politically motivated marriage to position Brutus as heir to Cato's supporters, although Brutus still had good relations with Caesar at this point. Porcia did not get along with Brutus\u2019s mother, Servilia, and Cicero stated that both were very open in their resentment for each other.\nBrutus also was promised the prestigious urban praetorship for 44 BC and possibly earmarked for the consulship in 41.\nAssassination of Julius Caesar.\nThere are various different traditions describing the way in which Brutus arrived to the decision to assassinate Caesar. Plutarch, Appian, and Cassius Dio, all writing in the imperial period, focused on peer pressure and Brutus's perceived philosophical duty to his country and his family's reputation.\nConspiracy.\nBy autumn 45, public opinion of Caesar was starting to sour: Plutarch, Appian, and Dio all reported graffiti glorifying Brutus's ancestor Lucius Junius Brutus, panning Caesar's kingly ambitions, and derogatory comments made to Marcus Junius Brutus in Rome's open-air courts that he was failing to live up to his ancestors. Dio reports this public support came from the people of Rome; Plutarch however has the graffiti created by elites to shame Brutus into action. Regardless of the specific impetus, modern historians believe that at least some portion of popular opinion had turned against Caesar by early 44.\nCaesar deposed two plebeian tribunes in late January 44 for removing a crown from one of his statues; this attack on the tribunes undermined one of his main arguments \u2013 defending the rights of the tribunes \u2013 for going to civil war in 49. In February 44, Caesar thrice rejected a crown from Marcus Antonius to cheering crowds, but later accepted the title \"dictator perpetuo\", which in Latin translated either to dictator for life or as dictator for an undetermined term.\nCicero also wrote letters asking Brutus to reconsider his association with Caesar. Cassius Dio claims that Brutus's wife Porcia spurred Brutus's conspiracy, but evidence is unclear as to the extent of her influence. Gaius Cassius Longinus, also one of the praetors for that year and a former legate of Caesar's, also was involved in the formation of the conspiracy. Plutarch has Brutus approach Cassius at his wife's urging, while Appian and Dio have Cassius approaching Brutus (and in Dio, Cassius does so after opposing further honours for Caesar publicly).\nThe extent of Caesar's control over the political system also stymied the ambitions of many aristocrats of Brutus's generation: Caesar's dictatorship precluded many of the avenues for success which Romans recognised. The reduction of the senate to a rubber stamp ended political discussion in Caesar's senate; there was no longer any room for anyone to shape policy except by convincing Caesar; political success became a grant of Caesar's rather than something won competitively from the people. The Platonian philosophical tradition, of which Brutus was an active writer and thinker, also emphasised a duty to restore justice and to overthrow tyrants.\nRegardless of how the conspiracy was initially formed, Brutus and Cassius, along with Brutus's cousin and close ally of Caesar's, Decimus Junius Brutus, started to recruit to the conspiracy in late February 44. They recruited men including Gaius Trebonius, Publius Servilius Casca, Servius Sulpicius Galba, and others. There was a discussion late in the conspiracy as to whether Antony should be killed, which Brutus forcefully rejected: Plutarch says Brutus thought Antony could be turned to the tyrannicides; Appian says Brutus thought of the optics of purging the Caesarian elite rather than only removing a tyrant.\nVarious plans were proposed \u2013 an ambush on the \"via sacra\", an attack at the elections, or killing at a gladiator match \u2013 eventually, however, the conspiracy settled on a senate meeting on the Ides of March. The specific date carried symbolic importance, as consuls until the mid-2nd century BC had assumed their offices on that day (instead of early January). The reasons for choosing the Ides are unclear: Nicolaus of Damascus (writing in the Augustan period) assumed that a senate meeting would isolate Caesar from support; Appian reports on the possibility of other senators coming to the assassins' aid. Both possibilities \"are unlikely\" due to Caesar's expansion of the senate and the low number of conspirators relative to the whole senate body. More likely is Dio's suggestion that a senate meeting would give the conspirators a tactical advantage as, by smuggling weapons, only the conspirators would be armed.\nIdes of March.\nThe ancient sources embellish the Ides with omens ignored, soothsayers spurned, and notes to Caesar spilling the conspiracy unread, all contributing to the dramatic and tragic propagandic stories of Caesar's death. The specific implementation of the conspiracy had Trebonius detain Antony \u2013 then serving as co-consul with Caesar \u2013 outside the senate house; Caesar was then stabbed to death almost immediately. The specific details of the assassination vary between authors: Nicolaus of Damascus reports some eighty conspirators, Appian only listed fifteen, the number of wounds on Caesar ranges from twenty-three to thirty-five.\nPlutarch reports that Caesar yielded to the attack after seeing Brutus's participation; Dio reported that Caesar shouted in Greek \"kai su teknon\" (\"You too, child?\"). Suetonius' account, however, also cites Lucius Cornelius Balbus, a friend of Caesar's, as saying that the dictator fell in silence, with the possibility that Caesar spoke \"kai su teknon\" as a postscript. As dramatic death quotes were a staple of Roman literature, the historicity of the quote is unclear. The use of \"kai su\", however, indicates the possibility of a curse, per classicists James Russell and Jeffrey Tatum.\nImmediately after Caesar's death, senators fled the chaos. None attempted to aid Caesar or to move his body. Cicero reported that Caesar fell at the foot of the statue of Pompey. His body was only moved after night fell, carried home to Caesar's wife Calpurnia. The conspirators travelled to the Capitoline Hill; Caesar's deputy in the dictatorship, Marcus Aemilius Lepidus, moved a legion of troops from the Tiber Island into the city and surrounded the forum. Suetonius reports that Brutus and Cassius initially planned to seize Caesar's property and revoke his decrees, but stalled out of fear of Lepidus and Antony.\nBefore Lepidus' troops arrived to the forum, Brutus spoke before the people in a \"contio\". The text of that speech is lost. Dio says the \"liberatores\" promoted their support of democracy and liberty and told the people not to expect harm; Appian says the \"liberatores\" merely congratulated each other and recommended the recall of Sextus Pompey and the tribunes Caesar had recently deposed. The support of the people was tepid, even though other speeches followed supporting the tyrannicide. Publius Cornelius Dolabella, who was to become consul in a few days on the 18th, decided immediately to assume the consulship illegally, expressed his support of Brutus and Cassius before the people, and joined the \"liberatores\" on the Capitoline.\nCicero urged the tyrannicides to call a meeting of the senate to gather its support; but instead Brutus sent a delegation to the Caesarians, asking for a negotiated settlement. This may have been due to family connections: Lepidus was married to one of Brutus's sisters; or perhaps Brutus believed that Antony could be won over. The Caesarians delayed for a day, moving troops and gathering weapons and supplies for a possible conflict.\nAfter Caesar's death, Dio reports a series of prodigies and miraculous occurrences which are \"self-evidently fantastic\" and likely fictitious. Some of the supposed prodigies did in fact occur, but were actually unrelated to Caesar's death: Cicero's statue was knocked over but only in the next year, Mt Etna in Sicily did erupt but not contemporaneously, a comet was seen in the sky but only months later.\nSettlement.\nThe initial plan from Brutus and Cassius seems to have been to establish a period of calm and then to work towards a general reconciliation. While the Caesarians had troops near the capital at hand, the \"liberatores\" were soon to assume control of vast provincial holdings in the east which would provide them, within the year, with large armies and resources. Seeing that the military situation was initially problematic, the \"liberatores\" decided then to ratify Caesar's decrees so that they could hold on to their magistracies and provincial assignments to protect themselves and rebuild the republican front.\nCicero acted as an honest broker and hammered out a compromise solution: general amnesty for the assassins, ratification of Caesar's acts and appointments for the next two years, and guarantees to Caesar's veterans that they would receive their promised land grants. Caesar also was to receive a public funeral. If the settlement had held, there would have been a general resumption of the republic: Decimus would go to Gaul that year and be confirmed as consul in 42, where he would then hold elections for 41. The people celebrated the reconciliation but some of the hard-core Caesarians were convinced that civil war would follow.\nCaesar's funeral occurred on 20 March, with a rousing speech by Antony mourning the dictator and energising opposition against the tyrannicides. Various ancient sources report that the crowd set the senate house on fire and started a witch-hunt for the tyrannicides, but these may have been spurious embellishments added by Livy, according to T P Wiseman. Contrary to what is reported by Plutarch, the assassins stayed in Rome for a few weeks after the funeral until April 44, indicating some support among the population for the tyrannicides. A person calling himself Marius, claiming he was a descendant of Gaius Marius, started a plan to ambush Brutus and Cassius. Brutus, as urban praetor in charge of the city's courts, was able to get a special dispensation to leave the capital for more than 10 days, and he withdrew to one of his estates in Lanuvium, 20 miles south-east of Rome. This fake Marius, for his threats to the tyrannicides (and to Antony's political base), was executed by being thrown from the Tarpeian Rock in mid- or late April. Dolabella, the other consul, acting on his own initiative, took down an altar and column dedicated to Caesar.\nBy early May, Brutus was considering exile. Octavian's arrival, along with the fake Marius, caused Antony to lose some of the support of his veterans, he responded by touring Campania \u2013 officially to settle Caesar's veterans \u2013 but actually to buttress military support. Dolabella at this time was on the side of the \"liberatores\" and also was the only consul at Rome; Antony's brother Lucius Antonius helped Octavian to announce publicly that he was to fulfil the conditions of Caesar's will, handing an enormous amount of wealth to the citizenry. Brutus also wrote a number of speeches disseminated to the public defending his actions, emphasising how Caesar had invaded Rome, killed prominent citizens, and suppressed the popular sovereignty of the people.\nBy mid-May, Antony started on designs against Decimus Brutus's governorship in Cisalpine Gaul. He bypassed the senate and took the matter to the popular assemblies in June and enacted the reassignment of the Gallic province by law. At the same time, he proposed reassigning Brutus and Cassius from their provinces to instead purchase grain in Asia and Sicily. There was a meeting at Brutus's house attended by Cicero, Brutus and Cassius (and wives), and Brutus's mother, in which Cassius announced his intention to go to Syria while Brutus wanted to return to Rome, but ended up going to Greece. His initial plan to go to Rome, however, was to put on games in early July commemorating his ancestor Lucius Junius Brutus and promoting his cause; he instead delegated the games to a friend. Octavian also held games commemorating Caesar late in the month; around this time also, the \"liberatores\" started to prepare in earnest for civil war.\n\"Liberatores\"' civil war.\nPreparations in the East.\nThe senate assigned Brutus to Crete (and Cassius to Cyrene) in early August, both small and insignificant provinces with few troops. Later in the month, Brutus left Italy for the east. He was acclaimed in Greece by the younger Romans there and recruited many supporters from the young Roman aristocrats being educated in Athens. He discussed with the governor of Macedonia handing the province over to him; while Antony in Rome allocated the province to his brother Gaius, Brutus travelled north with an army to Macedonia, buoyed by funds collected by two outgoing \"quaestores\" at the end of the year.\nIn January 43, Brutus entered Macedonia with his army, and took Antony's brother Gaius captive. At the same time, the political situation in Rome turned against Antony, as Cicero was delivering his Phillipics. Over the next few months, Brutus spent his time in Greece building strength. In Italy, the senate at Cicero's urging fought against Antony at the battle of Mutina, where both consuls (Hirtius and Pansa) were killed. During this time, the republicans enjoyed the support of the senate, which confirmed Brutus and Cassius's commands in Macedonia and Syria, respectively.\nDolabella switched sides in 43, killing Trebonius in Syria and raising an army against Cassius. Brutus decamped for Syria in early May, writing letters to Cicero criticising Cicero's policy to support Octavian against Antony; at the same time, the senate had declared Antony an enemy of the state. In late May, Lepidus (married to Brutus's half-sister) \u2013 possibly forced by his own troops \u2013 joined Antony against Cicero, Octavian, and the senate, leading Brutus to write to Cicero asking him to protect both his own and Lepidus' family. The next month, Brutus's wife Porcia died.\nCicero's policy of attempting to unify Octavian with the senate against Antony and Lepidus started to fail in May; he requested Brutus to take his forces and march to his aid in Italy in mid-June. It seems that Brutus and Cassius in the east had substantial communications delays and failed to recognise that Antony had not been defeated, contra earlier assurances after Mutina. Over the next few months from June to 19 August, Octavian marched on Rome and forced his election as consul. Shortly afterwards, Octavian and his colleague, Quintus Pedius, passed the \"lex Pedia\" making the murder of a dictator retroactively illegal, and convicting Brutus and the assassins \"in absentia\". The new consuls also lifted the senate's decrees against Lepidus and Antony, clearing the way for a general Caesarian rapprochement. Under that law, Decimus was killed in the west some time in autumn, defeating the republican cause in the west; by 27 November 43, the Caesarians had fully settled their differences and passed the \"lex Titia\", forming the Second Triumvirate and instituting a series of brutal proscriptions. The proscriptions claimed many lives, including that of Cicero.\nWhen news of the triumvirate and their proscriptions reached Brutus in the east, he marched across the Hellespont into Macedonia to quell rebellion and conquered a number of cities in Thrace. After meeting Cassius in Smyrna in January 42, both generals also went on a campaign through southern Asia minor sacking cities which had aided their enemies.\nBrutus's depiction among certain authors, like Appian, suffered considerably from this eastern campaign, in which Brutus marched into cities like Xanthus enslaving their populations and plundering their wealth. Other ancient historians, including Plutarch, take a more apologetic tone, having Brutus regret with tears the violence done; this was common ancient literary device to excuse and praise morally condemnable actions, such as pillaging. The campaign continued with less sacking but more coerced payments; the ancient tradition on this turn also is divided, with Appian seeing eastern willingness to surrender emerging from stories of Xanthus' destruction contra Cassius Dio and Plutarch viewing the later portions of the campaign as emblematic of Brutus's virtues of moderation, justice, and honour.\nBy the end of the campaign in Asia minor, both Brutus and Cassius were tremendously rich. They reconvened at Sardis and marched into Thrace in August 42.\nPhilippi.\nThe Caesarians also marched into Greece, evading the naval patrols of Sextus Pompey, Lucius Staius Murcus, and Gnaeus Domitius Ahenobarbus. The \"liberatores\" had positioned themselves west of Neapolis with clear lines of communication back to their supplies in the east. Octavian and Antony, leading the Caesarian forces, were not so lucky, as their supply lines were harassed by the superior republican fleets, leading the \"liberatores\" to adopt a strategy of attrition.\nOctavian and Antony had some 95,000 infantry with 13,000 horsemen, while Brutus and Cassius had some 85,000 infantry and 20,000 cavalry. Flush with cash, the \"liberatores\" also had a substantial financial advantage, paying their soldiers in advance of the battle with 1,500 denarii a man and more for officers. Antony moved quickly to force an engagement immediately, building a causeway under cover of darkness into the swamps that anchored the republican left flank; Cassius, commanding the republican left, countered with a wall to cut off Antony from his men and to defend his own flank.\nIn the ensuing first battle of Philippi, the start of the battle is unclear. Appian says Antony attacked Cassius whereas Plutarch reports battle was joined more-or-less simultaneously. Brutus's forces defeated Octavian's troops on the republican right flank, sacking Octavian's camp and forcing the young Caesar to withdraw. Cassius's troops fared poorly against Antony's men, forcing Cassius to withdraw to a hill. Two stories then follow: Appian reports that Cassius heard of Brutus's victory, and killed himself out of shame; but all other sources describe how one of Cassius's legates failed to relay the news of Brutus's victory, causing Cassius to believe that Brutus had been defeated, and leading to his suicide.\nFollowing the first battle, Brutus assumed command of Cassius's army with the promise of a substantial cash reward. He also possibly promised his soldiers that he would allow them to plunder Thessalonica and Sparta after victory, as the cities had supported the triumvirs in the conflict. Fearful of defections among his troops and the possibility of Antony cutting his supply lines, Brutus joined battle after attempting for some time to continue the original strategy of starving the enemy out. The resulting second battle of Philippi was a head-to-head struggle in which the sources report few tactical manoeuvres but heavy casualties, especially among eminent republican families.\nAfter the defeat, Brutus fled into the nearby hills with about four legions. Knowing his army had been defeated and that he would be captured, he took his own life by falling on his sword. Among his last words were, according to Plutarch, \"By all means must we fly, but with our hands, not our feet\". Brutus reportedly also uttered the well-known verse calling down a curse quoted from Euripides' \"Medea\": \"O Zeus, do not forget who has caused all these woes\". It is, however, unclear whether Brutus was referring to Antony, as claimed by Appian, or otherwise Octavian, as Kathryn Tempest believes. Also according to Plutarch, he praised his friends for not deserting him before encouraging them to save themselves.\nSome sources report that Antony, upon discovering Brutus's body, as a show of great respect, ordered it to be wrapped in Antony's most expensive purple mantle and cremated, with the ashes to be sent to Brutus's mother, Servilia. Suetonius, however, reports that Octavian had Brutus's head cut off and planned to have it displayed before a statue of Caesar until it was thrown overboard during a storm in the Adriatic.\nLegacy.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nShakespeare, \"Julius Caesar\", 5.5.69\u201376.\nBrutus's historical character has undergone numerous revisions and remains divisive. Dominant views of Brutus vary by time and geography.\nAncient views.\nIn the ancient world, Brutus's legacy was a topic of substantial debate. Starting from his own times and shortly after his death, he was already viewed as having killed Caesar for virtuous reasons rather than envy or hatred. For example, Plutarch, in his \"Life of Brutus\" from \"Parallel Lives\", mentions that Brutus's enemies respected him, recounting that Antony once said that \"Brutus was the only man to have slain Caesar because he was driven by the splendour and nobility of the deed, while the rest conspired against the man because they hated and envied him\".\nEven when he was still alive, Brutus's literary output, especially the pamphlets of 52\u00a0BC against Pompey's dictatorship (\"De dictatura Pompei\") and in support of Milo (\"Pro T. Annio Milone\") coloured him as philosophically consistent, and motivated only by principle. Cicero, in his \"De Officiis\", expressed that the act of the conspirators, including Brutus, was a moral duty. The main charge against him in the ancient world was that of ingratitude, viewing Brutus as ungrateful in taking Caesar's goodwill and support and then killing him. An even more negative historiographical tradition viewed Brutus and his compatriots as criminal murderers. Still, during the Augustan age, historians were said to have written about Brutus and the other conspirators respectfully. Even Augustus himself was alleged to tolerate positive views of Brutus. However, the Forum of Augustus, which included statues of various republican heroes, omitted men such as Cato the Younger, Cicero, Brutus, and Cassius.\nThe divisive views of Brutus in the early Principate had little changed by the reign of Tiberius; in fact, the atmosphere became more intolerant. The historian Cremutius Cordus was charged with treason for having written a history too friendly to Brutus and Cassius. Around the same time, Valerius Maximus, writing with the support of the imperial regime, believed Brutus's memory suffered from \"irreversible curses\". During this time, \"admiration of Brutus and Cassius was more sinisterly interpreted as a cry of protest against the imperial system\". The stoic, Seneca the Younger, argued that since Caesar was a good king, Brutus's fear was unfounded, and that he did not think through the consequences of Caesar's death.\nBut by the time that Plutarch was actually writing his \"Life of Brutus\", \"the oral and written tradition had been worked over to create a streamlined, and largely positive, narrative of Brutus' motives\". Some high imperial writers also admired his rhetorical skills, especially Pliny the Younger and Tacitus, with the latter writing, \"in my opinion, Brutus alone among them laid bare the convictions of his heart frankly and ingeniously, with neither ill-will nor spite\".\nMedieval and Renaissance views.\nIn the 12th century, English writer John of Salisbury, who owned a copy of \"De Officis\", emulated Cicero\u2019s beliefs by defending tyrannicide as a moral obligation. Thomas Aquinas also initially agreed with Cicero\u2019s defense of Brutus. However, he later changed his beliefs, expressing that while tyrants should be overthrown under certain circumstances, mild tyrants ought to be tolerated out of possible unintended consequences.\nDante Alighieri's \"Inferno\" notably placed Brutus in the lowest circle of Hell for his betrayal of Caesar, where he (along with Cassius and Judas Iscariot) is personally tortured by Satan. Dante's views gave a further theological bent as well: by killing Caesar, Brutus \"was resisting God's 'historical design'\": the development of the Roman Empire with its fusion with Christianity and the Christianised monarchies of his day.\nRenaissance writers, however, tended to view him more positively, as Brutus's assassination of Caesar symbolised ancient republican ideology. Various men in the renaissance and early modern periods were called or adopted the name Brutus: In 1537, the \"Florentine Brutus\", Lorenzino de' Medici, killed his cousin Duke Alessandro allegedly to free Florence; the French pamphlet \"Vindiciae contra tyrannos\" (Defences against tyrants) was published in 1579 under the pseudonym Stephanus Junius Brutus; the \"British Brutus\" Algernon Sidney was executed in 1683 for allegedly plotting against Charles II. Brutus was also present in the arts during the early modern period, particularly in Shakespeare's \"Julius Caesar\", which depicted him \"more of a troubled soul than a public symbol... [and] often sympathetic\".\nModern views.\nViews of Brutus as a symbol of republicanism have remained through the modern period. For example, the Anti-Federalist Papers in 1787 were written under the pseudonym \"Brutus\". Similar anti-federalist letters and pamphlets were written by other Roman republican names such as Cato and Poplicola.\nConyers Middleton and Edward Gibbon, writing in the late 18th century, had negative views. Middleton believed Brutus's vacillations in correspondence with Cicero betrayed his claims to philosophical consistency. Gibbon conceived of Brutus's actions in terms of their results: the destruction of the republic, civil war, death, and future tyranny. More teleological views of Brutus's actions are viewed sceptically by historians today: Ronald Syme, for example, pointed out \"to judge Brutus because he failed is simply to judge from the results\".\nThe influential \"History of Rome\" by Theodor Mommsen in the late 19th century \"cast a damning verdict on Brutus\" by ending with Caesar's reforms in 46\u00a0BC, along with advancing a view that Caesar \"had some sort of solution to the problem of how to deal with Rome's growing empire\" (of which there is no surviving description). Similarly, views of Brutus are also bound up with assessment of the republic: those who believe the republic was not worth saving or in an inevitable decline, views perhaps coloured by hindsight, view him more negatively.\nThere remains little consensus on Brutus's actions as a whole.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

In the valley between the Aventine and Palatine hills, it was the first and largest stadium in ancient Rome and its later Empire. It measured in length and in width and could accommodate over 150,000 spectators. In its fully developed form, it became the model for circuses throughout the Roman Empire. The site is now a public park.\nEvents and uses.\nThe Circus was Rome's largest venue for \"ludi\", public games connected to Roman religious festivals. \"Ludi\" were sponsored by leading Romans or the Roman state for the benefit of the Roman people (\"populus Romanus\") and gods. Most were held annually or at annual intervals on the Roman calendar. Others might be given to fulfill a religious vow, such as the games in celebration of a triumph. In Roman tradition, the earliest triumphal \"ludi\" at the Circus were vowed by Tarquin the Proud to Jupiter in the late Regal era for his victory over Pometia.\n\"Ludi\" ranged in duration and scope from one-day or even half-day events to spectacular multi-venue celebrations held over several days, with religious ceremonies and public feasts, horse and chariot racing, athletics, plays and recitals, beast-hunts and gladiator fights. Some included public executions. The greater \"ludi\" (meaning sport or game in Latin) at the Circus began with a flamboyant parade \"(pompa circensis)\", much like the triumphal procession, which marked the purpose of the games and introduced the participants.\nDuring the Roman Republic, the aediles organized the games. The most costly and complex of the \"ludi\" offered opportunities to assess an aedile's competence, generosity, and fitness for higher office. Some Circus events, however, seem to have been relatively small and intimate affairs. In 167 BC, \"flute players, scenic artists and dancers\" performed on a temporary stage, probably erected between the two central seating banks. Others were enlarged at enormous expense to fit the entire space. A \"venatio\" held there in 169 BC, one of several in the 2nd century, employed \"63 leopards and 40 bears and elephants\", with spectators presumably kept safe by a substantial barrier.\nAs Rome's provinces expanded, existing \"ludi\" were embellished and new \"ludi\" invented by politicians who competed for divine and popular support. By the late Republic, \"ludi\" were held on 57 days of the year; an unknown number of these would have required full use of the Circus. On many other days, charioteers and jockeys would need to practise on its track. Otherwise, it would have made a convenient corral for the animals traded in the nearby Forum Boarium, just outside the starting gate. Beneath the outer stands, next to the Circus' entrances, were workshops and shops. When no games were being held, the Circus at the time of Catullus (mid-1st century BC) was probably \"a dusty open space with shops and booths ... a colourful crowded disreputable area\" frequented by \"prostitutes, jugglers, fortune tellers and low-class performing artists\".\nRome's emperors met the growing popular demand for regular \"ludi\" and the need for more specialised venues, as obligations of their office and cult. Over the centuries of its development, the Circus Maximus became Rome's paramount specialist venue for chariot races. By the late 1st century AD, the Colosseum had been built for most of the city's gladiator shows and smaller beast-hunts, and most track-athletes competed at the purpose-designed Stadium of Domitian, though long-distance foot races were still held at the Circus. Eventually, 135 days of the year were devoted to \"ludi\".\nEven at the height of its development as a chariot-racing circuit, the circus remained the most suitable space in Rome for religious processions on a grand scale and was the most popular venue for large-scale \"venationes\"; in the late 3rd century, the emperor Probus laid on a spectacular Circus show in which beasts were hunted through a veritable forest of trees, on a specially built stage. With the advent of Christianity as the official religion of the Empire, \"ludi\" gradually fell out of favour. The last known beast-hunt at the Circus Maximus took place in 523, and the last known races there were held by Totila in 549.\nTopography and construction.\nRegal era.\nThe Circus Maximus was sited on the level ground of the Valley of Murcia \"(Vallis Murcia)\", between Rome's Aventine and Palatine Hills. In Rome's early days, the valley would have been rich agricultural land, prone to flooding from the river Tiber and the stream which divided the valley lengthwise. The stream was probably bridged at an early date, at the two points where the track had to cross it, and the earliest races would have been held within an agricultural landscape, \"with nothing more than turning posts, banks where spectators could sit, and some shrines and sacred spots\".\nIn Livy's \"History of Rome\", the first Etruscan king of Rome, Lucius Tarquinius Priscus, built raised, wooden perimeter seating at the Circus for Rome's highest echelons (the equites and patricians), probably midway along the Palatine straight, with an awning against the sun and rain. His grandson, Tarquinius Superbus, added the first seating for citizen-commoners (plebs, or plebeians), either adjacent or on the opposite, Aventine side of the track. Otherwise, the Circus was probably still little more than a trackway through surrounding farmland. By this time, it may have been drained but the wooden stands and seats would have frequently rotted and been rebuilt. The turning posts (\"metae\"), each made of three conical stone pillars, may have been the earliest permanent Circus structures; an open drainage canal between the posts would have served as a dividing barrier.\nRepublican era.\nThe games' sponsor (Latin \"editor)\" usually sat beside the images of attending gods, on a conspicuous, elevated stand (\"pulvinar\") but seats at the track's perimeter offered the best, most dramatic close-ups. In 494 BC (very early in the Republican era) the dictator Manius Valerius Maximus and his descendants were granted rights to a curule chair at the southeastern turn, an excellent viewpoint for the thrills and spills of chariot racing. In the 190s\u00a0BC, stone track-side seating was built, exclusively for senators.\nPermanent wooden starting stalls were built in 329 BC. They were gated, brightly painted, and staggered to equalise the distances from each start place to the central barrier. In theory, they might have accommodated up to 25 four-horse chariots (Quadrigas) abreast but when team-racing was introduced, they were widened, and their number reduced. By the late Republican or early Imperial era, there were twelve stalls. Their divisions were fronted by herms that served as stops for spring-loaded gates, so that twelve light-weight, four-horse or two-horse chariots could be simultaneously released onto the track. The stalls were allocated by lottery, and the various racing teams were identified by their colors, with the main two being the Blues and the Greens. Typically, there were seven laps per race. From at least 174\u00a0BC, they were counted off using large sculpted eggs. In 33\u00a0BC, an additional system of large bronze dolphin-shaped lap counters was added, positioned well above the central dividing barrier \"(euripus)\" for maximum visibility.\nJulius Caesar's development of the Circus, commencing around 50\u00a0BC, extended the seating tiers to run almost the entire circuit of the track, barring the starting gates and a processional entrance at the semi-circular end. The track measured approximately in length and in breadth. A\u00a0canal between the track perimeter and its seating protected spectators and help drain the track. The inner third of the seating formed a trackside \"cavea\". Its front sections along the central straight were reserved for senators, and those immediately behind for \"equites\". The outer tiers, two thirds of the total, were meant for Roman plebs and non-citizens. They were timber-built, with wooden-framed service buildings, shops and entrance-ways beneath. The total number of seats is uncertain, but was probably in the order of 150,000; Pliny the Elder's estimate of 250,000 seating places is unlikely. The wooden bleachers were damaged in a fire of 31\u00a0BC, either during or after construction.\nImperial era.\nThe fire damage of 31 was probably repaired by Augustus (Caesar's successor and Rome's first emperor). He modestly claimed credit only for an obelisk and \"pulvinar\" at the site but both were major projects. Ever since its quarrying, long before Rome existed, the obelisk had been sacred to Egyptian Sun-gods. Augustus had it brought from Heliopolis at enormous expense, and erected midway along the dividing barrier of the Circus. It was Rome's first obelisk, an exotically sacred object and a permanent reminder of Augustus' victory over his Roman foes and their Egyptian allies in the recent civil wars. Thanks to him, Rome had secured both a lasting peace and a new Egyptian Province. The \"pulvinar\" was built on monumental scale, a shrine or temple (\"aedes\") raised high above the trackside seats. Sometimes, while games were in progress, Augustus watched from there, alongside the gods. Occasionally, his family would join him there. This is the Circus described by Dionysius of Halicarnassus as \"one of the most beautiful and admirable structures in Rome\", with \"entrances and ascents for the spectators at every shop, so that the countless thousands of people may enter and depart without inconvenience.\"\nThe site remained prone to flooding, probably through the starting gates, until Claudius made improvements there; they probably included an extramural anti-flooding embankment. Fires in the crowded, wooden perimeter workshops and bleachers were a far greater danger. A fire of 36 AD seems to have started in a basket-maker's workshop under the stands, on the Aventine side; the emperor Tiberius compensated various small businesses there for their losses. In AD 64, during Nero's reign, fire broke out at the semi-circular end of the Circus, swept through the stands and shops, and destroyed much of the city. Games and festivals continued at the Circus, which was rebuilt over several years to the same footprint and design.\nBy the late 1st century AD, the central dividing barrier comprised a series of water basins, or else a single watercourse open in some places and bridged over in others. It offered opportunities for artistic embellishment and decorative swagger, and included the temples and statues of various deities, fountains, and refuges for those assistants involved in more dangerous circus activities, such as beast-hunts and the recovery of casualties during races.\nIn AD 81 the Senate built a triple arch honoring Titus at the semi-circular end of the Circus, to replace or augment a former processional entrance. The emperor Domitian built a new, multi-storey palace on the Palatine, connected somehow to the Circus; he likely watched the games in autocratic style, from high above and barely visible to those below. Repairs to fire damage during his reign may already have been under way before his assassination.\nThe risk of further fire-damage, coupled with Domitian's fate, may have prompted Trajan's decision to rebuild the Circus entirely in stone, and provide a new pulvinar in the stands where Rome's emperor could be seen and honoured as part of the Roman community, alongside their gods. Under Trajan, the Circus Maximus found its definitive form, which was unchanged thereafter save for some monumental additions by later emperors, an extensive, planned rebuilding of the starting gate area under Caracalla, and repairs and renewals to existing fabric. Of these, Pliny claims that Trajan's works gained a further 5,000 seats. Some repairs were unforeseen and extensive, such as those carried out in Diocletian's reign, after the collapse of a seating section killed some 13,000 people.\nReligious significance.\nThe southeastern turn of the track ran between two shrines which may have predated the Circus' formal development. One, at the outer southeast perimeter, was dedicated to the valley's eponymous goddess Murcia, an obscure deity associated with Venus, the myrtle shrub, a sacred spring, the stream that divided the valley, and the lesser peak of the Aventine Hill. The other was at the southeastern turning-post, where there was an underground shrine to Consus, a minor god of grain-stores, connected to the grain-goddess Ceres and to the underworld. According to Roman tradition, Romulus discovered this shrine shortly after the founding of Rome. He invented the Consualia festival, as a way of gathering his Sabine neighbours at a celebration that included horse-races and drinking. During these distractions, Romulus's men then abducted the Sabine daughters as brides. Thus the famous Roman myth of the Rape of the Sabine women had as its setting the Circus and the Consualia.\nIn this quasi-legendary era, horse or chariot races would have been held at the Circus site. The track width may have been determined by the distance between Murcia's and Consus' shrines at the southeastern end, and its length by the distance between these two shrines and Hercules' Ara Maxima, supposedly older than Rome itself and sited behind the Circus' starting place. The position of Consus' shrine at the turn of the track recalls the placing of shrines to Roman Neptune's Greek equivalent, Poseidon, in Greek hippodromes. In later developments, the altar of Consus, as one of the Circus' patron deities, was incorporated into the fabric of the south-eastern turning post. When Murcia's stream was partly built over, to form a dividing barrier (the \"spina\" or \"euripus\") between the turning posts, her shrine was either retained or rebuilt. In the Late Imperial period, both the southeastern turn and the circus itself were sometimes known as \"Vallis Murcia\". The symbols used to count race-laps also held religious significance; Castor and Pollux, who were born from an egg, were patrons of horses, horsemen, and the equestrian order \"(equites)\". Likewise, the later use of dolphin-shaped lap counters reinforced associations between the races, swiftness, and Neptune, as god of earthquakes and horses; the Romans believed dolphins to be the swiftest of all creatures. When the Romans adopted the Phrygian Great Mother as an ancestral deity, a statue of her on lion-back was erected within the circus, probably on the dividing barrier.\nSun and Moon cults were probably represented at the Circus from its earliest phases. Their importance grew with the introduction of Roman cult to Apollo, and the development of Stoic and solar monism as a theological basis for the Roman Imperial cult. In the Imperial era, the Sun-god was divine patron of the Circus and its games. His sacred obelisk towered over the arena, set in the central barrier, close to his temple and the finishing line. The Sun-god was the ultimate, victorious charioteer, driving his four-horse chariot (\"quadriga\") through the heavenly circuit from sunrise to sunset. His partner Luna drove her two-horse chariot (\"biga\"); together, they represented the predictable, orderly movement of the cosmos and the circuit of time, which found analogy in the Circus track. Luna's temple, which was probably built long before Apollo's, burned down in the Great Fire of 64 AD and was probably not replaced. Her cult was closely identified with that of Diana, who seems to have been represented in the processions that started Circus games, and with Sol Indiges, usually identified as her brother. After the loss of her temple, her cult may have been transferred to Sol's temple on the dividing barrier, or one beside it; both would have been open to the sky.\nTemples to several deities overlooked the Circus; most are now lost. The temples to Ceres and Flora stood close together on the Aventine, more or less opposite the Circus' starting gate, which remained under Hercules' protection. Further southeast along the Aventine was a temple to Luna, the moon goddess. Aventine temples to Venus Obsequens, Mercury and Dis (or perhaps Summanus) stood on the slopes above the southeast turn. On the Palatine hill, opposite to Ceres's temple, stood the temple to Magna Mater and, more or less opposite Luna's temple, one to the sun-god Apollo.\nSeveral festivals, some of uncertain foundation and date, were held at the Circus in historical times. The Consualia, with its semi-mythical establishment by Romulus, and the Cerealia, the major festival of Ceres, were probably older than the earliest historically attested \"Roman Games\" \"(Ludi Romani)\" held at the Circus in honour of Jupiter in 366 BC. In the early Imperial era, Ovid describes the opening of Cerealia (mid to late April) with a horse race at the Circus, followed by the nighttime release of foxes into the stadium, their tails ablaze with lighted torches. Some early connection is likely between Ceres as goddess of grain crops and Consus as a god of grain storage and patron of the Circus.\nModern status and uses.\nAfter the 6th century, the Circus fell into disuse and decay. The lower levels, ever prone to flooding, were gradually buried under waterlogged alluvial soil and accumulated debris, so that the original track is now buried six meters beneath the modern surface. In the 11th century, the Circus was \"replaced by dwellings rented out by the congregation of Saint-Guy.\" In the 12th century, a watercourse was dug there to drain the soil, and by the 16th century the area was used as a market garden. During the renaissance, the site was one of many used as a convenient quarry for good quality building stone. Many of the Circus's standing structures survived these changes; in 1587, two obelisks were removed from the central barrier by Pope Sixtus V, and one of these was re-sited at the Piazza del Popolo. In 1852, a gas works was built on the site by the Anglo-Italian Gas Society. It remained in situ until 1910 when it was relocated to the edge of Rome. Mid-19th century workings at the circus site uncovered the lower parts of a seating tier and outer portico. Since then, a series of excavations has exposed further sections of the seating, curved turn and central barrier but further exploration has been limited by the scale, depth and waterlogging of the site.\nThe Circus site now functions as a large park area, open to the public and often used for concerts, meetings, and celebrations.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Sister-inline/styles.css\"/&gt; Media related to at Wikimedia Commons"}

The functional group itself (without the \"R\" side chain) can be referred to as an aldehyde but can also be classified as a formyl group. Aldehydes are a common motif in many chemicals important in technology and biology.\nStructure and bonding.\nAldehyde molecules have a central carbon atom that is connected by a double bond to oxygen, a single bond to hydrogen and another single bond to a third substituent, which is carbon or, in the case of formaldehyde, hydrogen. The central carbon is often described as being sp2-hybridized. The aldehyde group is somewhat polar. The bond length is about 120\u2013122 picometers.\nPhysical properties and characterization.\nAldehydes have properties that are diverse and that depend on the remainder of the molecule. Smaller aldehydes such as formaldehyde and acetaldehyde are soluble in water, and the volatile aldehydes have pungent odors.\nAldehydes can be identified by spectroscopic methods. Using IR spectroscopy, they display a strong \"\u03bd\"CO band near 1700\u00a0cm\u22121. In their 1H NMR spectra, the formyl hydrogen center absorbs near \"\u03b4\"H\u00a09.5 to 10, which is a distinctive part of the spectrum. This signal shows the characteristic coupling to any protons on the \u03b1 carbon with a small coupling constant typically less than 3.0\u00a0Hz. The 13C NMR spectra of aldehydes and ketones gives a suppressed (weak) but distinctive signal at \"\u03b4\"C\u00a0190 to 205.\n Important aldehydes and related compounds. The aldehyde group (or formyl group) is colored red. From the left: (1) formaldehyde and (2) its trimer 1,3,5-trioxane, (3) acetaldehyde and (4) its enol vinyl alcohol, (5) glucose (pyranose form as \u03b1-D-glucopyranose), (6) the flavorant cinnamaldehyde, (7) retinal, which forms with opsins photoreceptors, and (8) the vitamin pyridoxal.\nApplications and occurrence.\nNaturally occurring aldehydes.\nTraces of many aldehydes are found in essential oils and often contribute to their pleasant odours, including cinnamaldehyde, cilantro, and vanillin. Possibly due to the high reactivity of the formyl group, aldehydes are not commonly found in organic \"building block\" molecules, such as amino acids, nucleic acids, and lipids. However, most sugars are derivatives of aldehydes. These aldoses exist as hemiacetals, a sort of masked form of the parent aldehyde. For example, in aqueous solution only a tiny fraction of glucose exists as the aldehyde.\nSynthesis.\nHydroformylation.\nOf the several methods for preparing aldehydes, one dominant technology is hydroformylation. Hydroformylation is conducted on a very large scale for diverse aldehydes. It involves treatment of the alkene with a mixture of hydrogen gas and carbon monoxide in the presence of a metal catalyst. Illustrative is the generation of butyraldehyde by hydroformylation of propylene:\nOne complication with this process is the formation of isomers, such as isobutyraldehyde:\nOxidative routes.\nThe largest operations involve methanol and ethanol respectively to formaldehyde and acetaldehyde, which are produced on multimillion ton scale annually. Other large scale aldehydes are produced by autoxidation of hydrocarbons: benzaldehyde from toluene, acrolein from propylene, and methacrolein from isobutene. In the Wacker process, oxidation of ethylene to acetaldehyde in the presence of copper and palladium catalysts, is also used. \"Green\" and cheap oxygen (or air) is the oxidant of choice.\nLaboratories may instead apply a wide variety of specialized oxidizing agents, which are often consumed stoichiometrically. Chromium(VI) reagents are popular. Oxidation can be achieved by heating the alcohol with an acidified solution of potassium dichromate. In this case, excess dichromate will further oxidize the aldehyde to a carboxylic acid, so either the aldehyde is distilled out as it forms (if volatile) or milder reagents such as PCC are used.\nA variety of reagent systems achieve aldehydes under chromium-free conditions. One such are the hypervalent organoiodine compounds (i.e., IBX acid, Dess\u2013Martin periodinane), although these often also oxidize the \u03b1 position. A Lux-Flood acid will activate other pre-oxidized substrates: various sulfoxides (e.g. the Swern oxidation), or amine oxides (e.g., the Ganem oxidation). Sterically-hindered nitroxyls (i.e., TEMPO) can catalyze aldehyde formation with a cheaper oxidant.\nAlternatively, vicinal diols or their oxidized sequelae (acyloins or \u03b1-hydroxy acids) can be oxidized with cleavage to two aldehydes or an aldehyde and carbon dioxide.\nCommon reactions.\nAldehydes participate in many reactions. From the industrial perspective, important reactions are:\nAcid-base reactions.\nBecause of resonance stabilization of the conjugate base, an \u03b1-hydrogen in an aldehyde is weakly acidic with a p\"K\"a near 17. Note, however, this is much more acidic than an alkane or ether hydrogen, which has p\"K\"a near 50 approximately, and is even more acidic than a ketone \u03b1-hydrogen which has p\"K\"a near 20. This acidification of the \u03b1-hydrogen in aldehyde is attributed to:\nThe formyl proton itself does not readily undergo deprotonation.\nEnolization.\nAldehydes (except those without an alpha carbon, or without protons on the alpha carbon, such as formaldehyde and benzaldehyde) can exist in either the keto or the enol tautomer. Keto\u2013enol tautomerism is catalyzed by either acid or base. In neutral solution, the enol is the minority tautomer, reversing several times per second. But it becomes the dominant tautomer in strong acid or base solutions, and enolized aldehydes undergo nucleophilic attack at the \u03b1 position.\nReduction.\nThe formyl group can be readily reduced to a primary alcohol (). Typically this conversion is accomplished by catalytic hydrogenation either directly or by transfer hydrogenation. Stoichiometric reductions are also popular, as can be effected with sodium borohydride.\nOxidation.\nThe formyl group readily oxidizes to the corresponding carboxyl group (). The preferred oxidant in industry is oxygen or air. In the laboratory, popular oxidizing agents include potassium permanganate, nitric acid, chromium(VI) oxide, and chromic acid. The combination of manganese dioxide, cyanide, acetic acid and methanol will convert the aldehyde to a methyl ester.\nAnother oxidation reaction is the basis of the \"silver-mirror test\". In this test, an aldehyde is treated with Tollens' reagent, which is prepared by adding a drop of sodium hydroxide solution into silver nitrate solution to give a precipitate of silver(I) oxide, and then adding just enough dilute ammonia solution to redissolve the precipitate in aqueous ammonia to produce complex. This reagent converts aldehydes to carboxylic acids without attacking carbon\u2013carbon double bonds. The name \"silver-mirror test\" arises because this reaction produces a precipitate of silver, whose presence can be used to test for the presence of an aldehyde.\nA further oxidation reaction involves Fehling's reagent as a test. The complex ions are reduced to a red-brick-coloured precipitate.\nIf the aldehyde cannot form an enolate (e.g., benzaldehyde), addition of strong base induces the Cannizzaro reaction. This reaction results in disproportionation, producing a mixture of alcohol and carboxylic acid.\nNucleophilic addition reactions.\nNucleophiles add readily to the carbonyl group. In the product, the carbonyl carbon becomes sp3-hybridized, being bonded to the nucleophile, and the oxygen center becomes protonated:\n\nIn many cases, a water molecule is removed after the addition takes place; in this case, the reaction is classed as an addition\u2013elimination or addition\u2013condensation reaction. There are many variations of nucleophilic addition reactions.\nOxygen nucleophiles.\nIn the acetalisation reaction, under acidic or basic conditions, an alcohol adds to the carbonyl group and a proton is transferred to form a hemiacetal. Under acidic conditions, the hemiacetal and the alcohol can further react to form an acetal and water. Simple hemiacetals are usually unstable, although cyclic ones such as glucose can be stable. Acetals are stable, but revert to the aldehyde in the presence of acid. Aldehydes can react with water to form hydrates, . These diols are stable when strong electron withdrawing groups are present, as in chloral hydrate. The mechanism of formation is identical to hemiacetal formation.\nAnother aldehyde molecule can also act as the nucleophile to give polymeric or oligomeric acetals called paraldehydes.\nNitrogen nucleophiles.\nIn alkylimino-de-oxo-bisubstitution, a primary or secondary amine adds to the carbonyl group and a proton is transferred from the nitrogen to the oxygen atom to create a carbinolamine. In the case of a primary amine, a water molecule can be eliminated from the carbinolamine intermediate to yield an imine or its trimer, a hexahydrotriazine This reaction is catalyzed by acid. Hydroxylamine () can also add to the carbonyl group. After the elimination of water, this results in an oxime. An ammonia derivative of the form such as hydrazine () or 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine can also be the nucleophile and after the elimination of water, resulting in the formation of a hydrazone, which are usually orange crystalline solids. This reaction forms the basis of a test for aldehydes and ketones.\nCarbon nucleophiles.\nThe cyano group in HCN can add to the carbonyl group to form cyanohydrins, . In this reaction the ion is the nucleophile that attacks the partially positive carbon atom of the carbonyl group. The mechanism involves a pair of electrons from the carbonyl-group double bond transferring to the oxygen atom, leaving it single-bonded to carbon and giving the oxygen atom a negative charge. This intermediate ion rapidly reacts with , such as from the HCN molecule, to form the alcohol group of the cyanohydrin.\nOrganometallic compounds, such as organolithium reagents, Grignard reagents, or acetylides, undergo nucleophilic addition reactions, yielding a substituted alcohol group. Related reactions include organostannane additions, Barbier reactions, and the Nozaki\u2013Hiyama\u2013Kishi reaction.\nIn the aldol reaction, the metal enolates of ketones, esters, amides, and carboxylic acids add to aldehydes to form \u03b2-hydroxycarbonyl compounds (aldols). Acid or base-catalyzed dehydration then leads to \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated carbonyl compounds. The combination of these two steps is known as the aldol condensation.\nThe Prins reaction occurs when a nucleophilic alkene or alkyne reacts with an aldehyde as electrophile. The product of the Prins reaction varies with reaction conditions and substrates employed.\nBisulfite reaction.\nAldehydes characteristically form \"addition compounds\" with bisulfites:\nThis reaction is used as a test for aldehydes and is useful for separation or purification of aldehydes.\nDialdehydes.\nA dialdehyde is an organic chemical compound with two aldehyde groups. The nomenclature of dialdehydes have the ending \"-dial\" or sometimes \"-dialdehyde\". Short aliphatic dialdehydes are sometimes named after the diacid from which they can be derived. An example is butanedial, which is also called succinaldehyde (from succinic acid).\nBiochemistry.\nSome aldehydes are substrates for aldehyde dehydrogenase enzymes which metabolize aldehydes in the body. There are toxicities associated with some aldehydes that are related to neurodegenerative disease, heart disease, and some types of cancer.\nUses.\nOf all aldehydes, formaldehyde is produced on the largest scale, about . It is mainly used in the production of resins when combined with urea, melamine, and phenol (e.g., Bakelite). It is a precursor to methylene diphenyl diisocyanate (\"MDI\"), a precursor to polyurethanes. The second main aldehyde is butyraldehyde, of which about are prepared by hydroformylation. It is the principal precursor to 2-ethylhexanol, which is used as a plasticizer. Acetaldehyde once was a dominating product, but production levels have declined to less than because it mainly served as a precursor to acetic acid, which is now prepared by carbonylation of methanol. Many other aldehydes find commercial applications, often as precursors to alcohols, the so-called oxo alcohols, which are used in detergents. Some aldehydes are produced only on a small scale (less than 1000 tons per year) and are used as ingredients in flavours and perfumes such as Chanel No. 5. These include cinnamaldehyde and its derivatives, citral, and lilial.\nNomenclature.\nIUPAC names for aldehydes.\nThe common names for aldehydes do not strictly follow official guidelines, such as those recommended by IUPAC, but these rules are useful. IUPAC prescribes the following nomenclature for aldehydes:\nEtymology.\nThe word \"aldehyde\" was coined by Justus von Liebig as a contraction of the Latin (dehydrogenated alcohol). In the past, aldehydes were sometimes named after the corresponding alcohols, for example, \"vinous aldehyde\" for acetaldehyde. (\"Vinous\" is from Latin \"wine\", the traditional source of ethanol, cognate with \"vinyl\".)\nThe term \"formyl group\" is derived from the Latin word \"ant\". This word can be recognized in the simplest aldehyde, formaldehyde, and in the simplest carboxylic acid, formic acid.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "37332", "revid": "372290", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37332", "title": "Josiah Willard Gibbs", "text": "American scientist (1839\u20131903)\nJosiah Willard Gibbs (; February 11, 1839 \u2013 April 28, 1903) was an American mechanical engineer and scientist who made fundamental theoretical contributions to physics, chemistry, and mathematics. His work on the applications of thermodynamics was instrumental in transforming physical chemistry into a rigorous deductive science. Together with James Clerk Maxwell and Ludwig Boltzmann, he created statistical mechanics (a term that he coined), explaining the laws of thermodynamics as consequences of the statistical properties of ensembles of the possible states of a physical system composed of many particles. Gibbs also worked on the application of Maxwell's equations to problems in physical optics. As a mathematician, he created modern vector calculus (independently of the British scientist Oliver Heaviside, who carried out similar work during the same period) and described the Gibbs phenomenon in the theory of Fourier analysis.\nIn 1863, Yale University awarded Gibbs the first American doctorate in engineering. After a three-year sojourn in Europe, Gibbs spent the rest of his career at Yale, where he was a professor of mathematical physics from 1871 until his death in 1903. Working in relative isolation, he became the earliest theoretical scientist in the United States to earn an international reputation and was praised by Albert Einstein as \"the greatest mind in American history\". In 1901, Gibbs received what was then considered the highest honor awarded by the international scientific community, the Copley Medal of the Royal Society of London, \"for his contributions to mathematical physics\".\nCommentators and biographers have remarked on the contrast between Gibbs's quiet, solitary life in turn of the century New England and the great international impact of his ideas. Though his work was almost entirely theoretical, the practical value of Gibbs's contributions became evident with the development of industrial chemistry during the first half of the 20th century. According to Robert A.\u00a0Millikan, in pure science, Gibbs \"did for statistical mechanics and thermodynamics what Laplace did for celestial mechanics and Maxwell did for electrodynamics, namely, made his field a well-nigh finished theoretical structure\".\nBiography.\nFamily background.\nGibbs was born in New Haven, Connecticut. He belonged to an old Yankee family that had produced distinguished American clergymen and academics since the 17th century. He was the fourth of five children and the only son of Josiah Willard Gibbs Sr. and his wife Mary Anna, \"n\u00e9e\" Van Cleve. On his father's side, he was descended from Samuel Willard, who served as acting President of Harvard College from 1701 to 1707. On his mother's side, one of his ancestors was the Rev. Jonathan Dickinson, the first president of the College of New Jersey (later Princeton University). Gibbs's given name, which he shared with his father and several other members of his extended family, derived from his ancestor Josiah Willard, who had been Secretary of the Province of Massachusetts Bay in the 18th century. His paternal grandmother, Mercy (Prescott) Gibbs, was the sister of Rebecca Minot Prescott Sherman, the wife of American founding father Roger Sherman; and he was the second cousin of Roger Sherman Baldwin (see the Amistad case below).\nThe elder Gibbs was generally known to his family and colleagues as \"Josiah\", while the son was called \"Willard\". Josiah Gibbs was a linguist and theologian who served as professor of sacred literature at Yale Divinity School from 1824 until his death in 1861. He is chiefly remembered today as the abolitionist who found an interpreter for the African passengers of the ship \"Amistad\", allowing them to testify during the trial that followed their rebellion against being sold as slaves.\nEducation.\nWillard Gibbs was educated at the Hopkins School and entered Yale College in 1854 at the age of 15. At Yale, Gibbs received prizes for excellence in mathematics and Latin, and he graduated in 1858, near the top of his class. He remained at Yale as a graduate student at the Sheffield Scientific School. At age 19, soon after his graduation from college, Gibbs was inducted into the Connecticut Academy of Arts and Sciences, a scholarly institution composed primarily of members of the Yale faculty.\nRelatively few documents from the period survive and it is difficult to reconstruct the details of Gibbs's early career with precision. In the opinion of biographers, Gibbs's principal mentor and champion, both at Yale and in the Connecticut Academy, was probably the astronomer and mathematician Hubert Anson Newton, a leading authority on meteors, who remained Gibbs's lifelong friend and confidant. After the death of his father in 1861, Gibbs inherited enough money to make him financially independent.\nRecurrent pulmonary trouble ailed the young Gibbs and his physicians were concerned that he might be susceptible to tuberculosis, which had killed his mother. He also suffered from astigmatism, whose treatment was then still largely unfamiliar to oculists, so that Gibbs had to diagnose himself and grind his own lenses. Though in later years he used glasses only for reading or other close work, Gibbs's delicate health and imperfect eyesight probably explain why he did not volunteer to fight in the Civil War of 1861\u201365. He was not conscripted and he remained at Yale for the duration of the war.\nIn 1863, Gibbs received the first Doctorate of Philosophy (PhD) in engineering granted in the US, for a thesis entitled \"On the Form of the Teeth of Wheels in Spur Gearing\", in which he used geometrical techniques to investigate the optimum design for gears. In 1861, Yale had become the first US university to offer a PhD degree and Gibbs's was only the fifth PhD granted in the US in any subject.\nCareer, 1863\u20131873.\nAfter graduation, Gibbs was appointed as tutor at the college for a term of three years. During the first two years, he taught Latin, and during the third year, he taught \"natural philosophy\" (i.e., physics). In 1866, he patented a design for a railway brake and read a paper before the Connecticut Academy, entitled \"The Proper Magnitude of the Units of Length\", in which he proposed a scheme for rationalizing the system of units of measurement used in mechanics.\nAfter his term as tutor ended, Gibbs traveled to Europe with his sisters. They spent the winter of 1866\u201367 in Paris, where Gibbs attended lectures at the Sorbonne and the , given by such distinguished mathematical scientists as Joseph Liouville and Michel Chasles. Having undertaken a punishing regimen of study, Gibbs caught a serious cold and a doctor, fearing tuberculosis, advised him to rest on the Riviera, where he and his sisters spent several months and where he made a full recovery.\nMoving to Berlin, Gibbs attended the lectures taught by mathematicians Karl Weierstrass and Leopold Kronecker, as well as by chemist Heinrich Gustav Magnus. In August 1867, Gibbs's sister Julia was married in Berlin to Addison Van Name, who had been Gibbs's classmate at Yale. The newly married couple returned to New Haven, leaving Gibbs and his sister Anna in Germany. In Heidelberg, Gibbs was exposed to the work of physicists Gustav Kirchhoff and Hermann von Helmholtz, and chemist Robert Bunsen. At the time, German academics were the leading authorities in the natural sciences, especially chemistry and thermodynamics.\nGibbs returned to Yale in June 1869 and briefly taught French to engineering students. It was probably also around this time that he worked on a new design for a steam-engine governor, his last significant investigation in mechanical engineering. In 1871, he was appointed Professor of Mathematical Physics at Yale, the first such professorship in the United States. Gibbs, who had independent means and had yet to publish anything, was assigned to teach graduate students exclusively and was hired without salary.\nCareer, 1873\u20131880.\nGibbs published his first work in 1873. His papers on the geometric representation of thermodynamic quantities appeared in the \"Transactions of the Connecticut Academy\". These papers introduced the use of different type phase diagrams, which were his favorite aids to the imagination process when doing research, rather than the mechanical models, such as the ones that Maxwell used in constructing his electromagnetic theory, which might not completely represent their corresponding phenomena. Although the journal had few readers capable of understanding Gibbs's work, he shared reprints with correspondents in Europe and received an enthusiastic response from James Clerk Maxwell at Cambridge. Maxwell even made, with his own hands, a clay model illustrating Gibbs's construct. He then produced two plaster casts of his model and mailed one to Gibbs. That cast is on display at the Yale physics department.\nMaxwell included a chapter on Gibbs's work in the next edition of his \"Theory of Heat\", published in 1875. He explained the usefulness of Gibbs's graphical methods in a lecture to the Chemical Society of London and even referred to it in the article on \"Diagrams\" that he wrote for the \"Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica\". Prospects of collaboration between him and Gibbs were cut short by Maxwell's early death in 1879, aged 48. The joke later circulated in New Haven that \"only one man lived who could understand Gibbs's papers. That was Maxwell, and now he is dead.\"\nGibbs then extended his thermodynamic analysis to multi-phase chemical systems (i.e., to systems composed of more than one form of matter) and considered a variety of concrete applications. He described that research in a monograph titled \"On the Equilibrium of Heterogeneous Substances\", published by the Connecticut Academy in two parts that appeared respectively in 1875 and 1878. That work, which covers about three hundred pages and contains exactly seven hundred numbered mathematical equations, begins with a quotation from Rudolf Clausius that expresses what would later be called the first and second laws of thermodynamics: \"The energy of the world is constant. The entropy of the world tends towards a maximum.\"\nGibbs's monograph rigorously and ingeniously applied his thermodynamic techniques to the interpretation of physico-chemical phenomena, explaining and relating what had previously been a mass of isolated facts and observations. The work has been described as \"the \"Principia\" of thermodynamics\" and as a work of \"practically unlimited scope\". It solidly laid the foundation for physical Chemistry. Wilhelm Ostwald, who translated Gibbs's monograph into German, referred to Gibbs as the \"founder of chemical energetics\". According to modern commentators,\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;It is universally recognised that its publication was an event of the first importance in the history of chemistry\u00a0... Nevertheless it was a number of years before its value was generally known, this delay was due largely to the fact that its mathematical form and rigorous deductive processes make it difficult reading for anyone, and especially so for students of experimental chemistry whom it most concerns.\u2014\u200a\nGibbs continued to work without pay until 1880, when the new Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland offered him a position paying $3,000 per year. In response, Yale offered him an annual salary of $2,000, which he was content to accept.\nIn 1879, Gibbs derived the Gibbs\u2013Appell equation of motion, rediscovered in 1900 by Paul \u00c9mile Appell.\nCareer, 1880\u20131903.\nFrom 1880 to 1884, Gibbs worked on developing the exterior algebra of Hermann Grassmann into a vector calculus well-suited to the needs of physicists. With this object in mind, Gibbs distinguished between the dot and cross products of two vectors and introduced the concept of dyadics. Similar work was carried out independently, and at around the same time, by the British mathematical physicist and engineer Oliver Heaviside. Gibbs sought to convince other physicists of the convenience of the vectorial approach over the quaternionic calculus of William Rowan Hamilton, which was then widely used by British scientists. This led him, in the early 1890s, to a controversy with Peter Guthrie Tait and others in the pages of \"Nature\".\nGibbs's lecture notes on vector calculus were privately printed in 1881 and 1884 for the use of his students, and were later adapted by Edwin Bidwell Wilson into a textbook, \"Vector Analysis\", published in 1901. That book helped to popularize the \"del\" notation that is widely used today in electrodynamics and fluid mechanics. In other mathematical work, he re-discovered the \"Gibbs phenomenon\" in the theory of Fourier series (which, unbeknownst to him and to later scholars, had been described fifty years before by an obscure English mathematician, Henry Wilbraham).\nFrom 1882 to 1889, Gibbs wrote five papers on physical optics, in which he investigated birefringence and other optical phenomena and defended Maxwell's electromagnetic theory of light against the mechanical theories of Lord Kelvin and others. In his work on optics, just as much as in his work on thermodynamics, Gibbs deliberately avoided speculating about the microscopic structure of matter and purposefully confined his research problems to those that can be solved from broad general principles and experimentally confirmed facts. The methods that he used were highly original and the obtained results showed decisively the correctness of Maxwell's electromagnetic theory.\nGibbs coined the term \"statistical mechanics\" and introduced key concepts in the corresponding mathematical description of physical systems, including the notions of chemical potential (1876) and statistical ensemble (1902). Gibbs's derivation of the laws of thermodynamics from the statistical properties of systems consisting of many particles was presented in his highly influential textbook \"Elementary Principles in Statistical Mechanics\", published in 1902, a year before his death.\nGibbs's retiring personality and intense focus on his work limited his accessibility to students. His principal prot\u00e9g\u00e9 was Edwin Bidwell Wilson, who nonetheless explained that \"except in the classroom I saw very little of Gibbs. He had a way, toward the end of the afternoon, of taking a stroll about the streets between his study in the old Sloane Laboratory and his home\u2014a little exercise between work and dinner\u2014and one might occasionally come across him at that time.\" Gibbs did supervise the doctoral thesis on mathematical economics written by Irving Fisher in 1891. After Gibbs's death, Fisher financed the publication of his \"Collected Works\". Another distinguished student was Lee De Forest, later a pioneer of radio technology.\nGibbs died in New Haven on April 28, 1903, at the age of 64, the victim of an acute intestinal obstruction. A funeral was conducted two days later at his home on 121\u00a0High Street, and his body was buried in the nearby Grove Street Cemetery. In May, Yale organized a memorial meeting at the Sloane Laboratory. The eminent British physicist J. J. Thomson was in attendance and delivered a brief address.\nPersonal life and character.\nGibbs never married, living all his life in his childhood home with his sister Julia and her husband Addison Van Name, who was the Yale librarian. Except for his customary summer vacations in the Adirondacks (at Keene Valley, New York) and later at the White Mountains (in Intervale, New Hampshire), his sojourn in Europe in 1866\u20131869 was almost the only time that Gibbs spent outside New Haven. He joined Yale's College Church (a Congregational church) at the end of his freshman year and remained a regular attendant for the rest of his life. Gibbs generally voted for the Republican candidate in presidential elections but, like other \"Mugwumps\", his concern over the growing corruption associated with machine politics led him to support Grover Cleveland, a conservative Democrat, in the election of 1884. Little else is known of his religious or political views, which he mostly kept to himself.\nGibbs did not produce a substantial personal correspondence, and many of his letters were later lost or destroyed. Beyond the technical writings concerning his research, he published only two other pieces: a brief obituary for Rudolf Clausius, one of the founders of the mathematical theory of thermodynamics, and a longer biographical memoir of his mentor at Yale, H.\u00a0A.\u00a0Newton. In Edward Bidwell Wilson's view,\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Gibbs was not an advertiser for personal renown nor a propagandist for science; he was a scholar, scion of an old scholarly family, living before the days when research had become \"r\u00e9\"search\u00a0... Gibbs was not a freak, he had no striking ways, he was a kindly dignified gentleman.\nAccording to Lynde Wheeler, who had been Gibbs's student at Yale, in his later years Gibbs\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;was always neatly dressed, usually wore a felt hat on the street, and never exhibited any of the physical mannerisms or eccentricities sometimes thought to be inseparable from genius\u00a0... His manner was cordial without being effusive and conveyed clearly the innate simplicity and sincerity of his nature.\nHe was a careful investor and financial manager, and at his death in 1903 his estate was valued at $100,000 (roughly $ today). For many years, he served as trustee, secretary, and treasurer of his alma mater, the Hopkins School. US President Chester A.\u00a0Arthur appointed him as one of the commissioners to the National Conference of Electricians, which convened in Philadelphia in September 1884, and Gibbs presided over one of its sessions. A keen and skilled horseman, Gibbs was seen habitually in New Haven driving his sister's carriage. In an obituary published in the \"American Journal of Science\", Gibbs's former student Henry A. Bumstead referred to Gibbs's personal character:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Unassuming in manner, genial and kindly in his intercourse with his fellow-men, never showing impatience or irritation, devoid of personal ambition of the baser sort or of the slightest desire to exalt himself, he went far toward realizing the ideal of the unselfish, Christian gentleman. In the minds of those who knew him, the greatness of his intellectual achievements will never overshadow the beauty and dignity of his life.\nMajor scientific contributions.\nChemical and electrochemical thermodynamics.\nGibbs's papers from the 1870s introduced the idea of expressing the internal energy\u00a0\"U\" of a system in terms of the entropy\u00a0\"S\", in addition to the usual state variables of volume\u00a0\"V\", pressure\u00a0\"p\", and temperature\u00a0\"T\". He also introduced the concept of the chemical potential\u00a0formula_1 of a given chemical species, defined to be the rate of the increase in \"U\" associated with the increase in the number \"N\" of molecules of that species (at constant entropy and volume). Thus, it was Gibbs who first combined the first and second laws of thermodynamics by expressing the infinitesimal change in the internal energy, d\"U\", of a closed system in the form\n formula_2\nwhere \"T\" is the absolute temperature, \"p\" is the pressure, d\"S\" is an infinitesimal change in entropy and d\"V\" is an infinitesimal change of volume. The last term is the sum, over all the chemical species in a chemical reaction, of the chemical potential, \"\u03bc\"i, of the \"i\"-th species, multiplied by the infinitesimal change in the number of moles, d\"N\"i of that species. By taking the Legendre transform of this expression, he defined the concepts of enthalpy \"H\" and Gibbs free energy \"G\":\n formula_3\nThis compares to the expression for Helmholtz free energy \"A\":\n formula_4\nWhen the Gibbs free energy for a chemical reaction is negative, the reaction will proceed spontaneously. When a chemical system is at equilibrium, the change in Gibbs free energy is zero. An equilibrium constant is simply related to the free energy change when the reactants are in their standard states:\n formula_5\nChemical potential is usually defined as partial molar Gibbs free energy:\n formula_6\nGibbs also obtained what later came to be known as the \"Gibbs\u2013Duhem equation\".\nIn an electrochemical reaction characterized by an electromotive force \u2130 and an amount of transferred charge \"Q\", Gibbs's starting equation becomes \n formula_7\nThe publication of the paper \"On the Equilibrium of Heterogeneous Substances\" (1874\u20131878) is now regarded as a landmark in the development of chemistry. In it, Gibbs developed a rigorous mathematical theory for various transport phenomena, including adsorption, electrochemistry, and the Marangoni effect in fluid mixtures. He also formulated the phase rule\n formula_8\nfor the number \"F\" of variables that may be independently controlled in an equilibrium mixture of \"C\" components existing in \"P\" phases. The phase rule is very useful in diverse areas, such as metallurgy, mineralogy, and petrology. It can also be applied to various research problems in physical chemistry.\nStatistical mechanics.\nTogether with James Clerk Maxwell and Ludwig Boltzmann, Gibbs founded \"statistical mechanics\", a term that he coined to identify the branch of theoretical physics that accounts for the observed thermodynamic properties of systems in terms of the statistics of ensembles of all possible physical states of a system composed of many particles. He introduced the concept of \"phase of a mechanical system\". He used the concept to define the microcanonical, canonical, and grand canonical ensembles; all related to the Gibbs measure, thus obtaining a more general formulation of the statistical properties of many-particle systems than Maxwell and Boltzmann had achieved before him.\nGibbs generalized Boltzmann's statistical interpretation of entropy formula_9 by defining the entropy of an arbitrary ensemble as\n formula_10\nwhere formula_11 is the Boltzmann constant, while the sum is over all possible microstates formula_12, with formula_13 the corresponding probability of the microstate (see Gibbs entropy formula). This same formula would later play a central role in Claude Shannon's information theory and is therefore often seen as the basis of the modern information-theoretical interpretation of thermodynamics.\nAccording to Henri Poincar\u00e9, writing in 1904, even though Maxwell and Boltzmann had previously explained the irreversibility of macroscopic physical processes in probabilistic terms, \"the one who has seen it most clearly, in a book too little read because it is a little difficult to read, is Gibbs, in his \"Elementary Principles of Statistical Mechanics\"\". Gibbs's analysis of irreversibility, and his formulation of Boltzmann's H-theorem and of the ergodic hypothesis, were major influences on the mathematical physics of the 20th century.\nGibbs was well aware that the application of the equipartition theorem to large systems of classical particles failed to explain the measurements of the specific heats of both solids and gases, and he argued that this was evidence of the danger of basing thermodynamics on \"hypotheses about the constitution of matter\". Gibbs's own framework for statistical mechanics, based on ensembles of macroscopically indistinguishable microstates, could be carried over almost intact after the discovery that the microscopic laws of nature obey quantum rules, rather than the classical laws known to Gibbs and to his contemporaries. His resolution of the so-called \"Gibbs paradox\", about the entropy of the mixing of gases, is now often cited as a prefiguration of the indistinguishability of particles required by quantum physics.\nVector analysis.\nBritish scientists, including Maxwell, had relied on Hamilton's quaternions in order to express the dynamics of physical quantities, like the electric and magnetic fields, having both a magnitude and a direction in three-dimensional space. Following W. K. Clifford in his \"Elements of Dynamic\" (1888), Gibbs noted that the product of quaternions could be separated into two parts: a one-dimensional (scalar) quantity and a three-dimensional vector, so that the use of quaternions involved mathematical complications and redundancies that could be avoided in the interest of simplicity and to facilitate teaching. In his Yale classroom notes he defined two distinct types of products for a pair of vectors: a dot product (or scalar product) and a cross product (or vector product). He also introduced the now common notation for them. Through the 1901 textbook \"Vector Analysis\" prepared by E. B. Wilson from Gibbs notes, he was largely responsible for the development of the vector calculus techniques still used today in electrodynamics and fluid mechanics.\nWhile he was working on vector analysis in the late 1870s, Gibbs discovered that his approach was similar to the one that Grassmann had taken in his \"multiple algebra\". Gibbs then sought to publicize Grassmann's work, stressing that it was both more general and historically prior to Hamilton's quaternionic algebra. To establish priority of Grassmann's ideas, Gibbs convinced Grassmann's heirs to seek the publication in Germany of the essay \"Theorie der Ebbe und Flut\" on tides that Grassmann had submitted in 1840 to the faculty at the University of Berlin, in which he had first introduced the notion of what would later be called a vector space (linear space).\nAs Gibbs had advocated in the 1880s and 1890s, quaternions were eventually all but abandoned by physicists in favor of the vectorial approach developed by him and, independently, by Oliver Heaviside. Gibbs applied his vector methods to the determination of planetary and comet orbits. He also developed the concept of mutually reciprocal triads of vectors that later proved to be of importance in crystallography.\nPhysical optics.\nThough Gibbs's research on physical optics is less well known today than his other work, it made a significant contribution to classical electromagnetism by applying Maxwell's equations to the theory of optical processes such as birefringence, dispersion, and optical activity. In that work, Gibbs showed that those processes could be accounted for by Maxwell's equations without any special assumptions about the microscopic structure of matter or about the nature of the medium in which electromagnetic waves were supposed to propagate (the so-called luminiferous ether). Gibbs also stressed that the absence of a longitudinal electromagnetic wave, which is needed to account for the observed properties of light, is automatically guaranteed by Maxwell's equations (by virtue of what is now called their \"gauge invariance\"), whereas in mechanical theories of light, such as Lord Kelvin's, it must be imposed as an \"ad hoc\" condition on the properties of the aether.\nIn his last paper on physical optics, Gibbs concluded that\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;it may be said for the electrical theory [of light] that it is not obliged to invent hypotheses, but only to apply the laws furnished by the science of electricity, and that it is difficult to account for the coincidences between the electrical and optical properties of media unless we regard the motions of light as electrical.\nShortly afterwards, the electromagnetic nature of light was demonstrated by the experiments of Heinrich Hertz in Germany.\nScientific recognition.\nGibbs worked at a time when there was little tradition of rigorous theoretical science in the United States. His research was not easily understandable to his students or his colleagues, and he made no effort to popularize his ideas or to simplify their exposition to make them more accessible. His seminal work on thermodynamics was published mostly in the \"Transactions of the Connecticut Academy\", a journal edited by his librarian brother-in-law, which was little read in the US and even less so in Europe. When Gibbs submitted his long paper on the equilibrium of heterogeneous substances to the academy, both Elias Loomis and H. A. Newton protested that they did not understand Gibbs's work at all, but they helped to raise the money needed to pay for the typesetting of the many mathematical symbols in the paper. Several Yale faculty members, as well as business and professional men in New Haven, contributed funds for that purpose.\nEven though it had been immediately embraced by Maxwell, Gibbs's graphical formulation of the laws of thermodynamics came into widespread use only in the mid 20th century, with the work of L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Tisza and Herbert Callen. According to James Gerald Crowther,\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;in his later years [Gibbs] was a tall, dignified gentleman, with a healthy stride and ruddy complexion, performing his share of household chores, approachable and kind (if unintelligible) to students. Gibbs was highly esteemed by his friends, but American science was too preoccupied with practical questions to make much use of his profound theoretical work during his lifetime. He lived out his quiet life at Yale, deeply admired by a few able students but making no immediate impress on American science commensurate with his genius.\nOn the other hand, Gibbs did receive the major honors then possible for an academic scientist in the US. He was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 1879 and received the 1880 Rumford Prize from the American Academy of Arts and Sciences for his work on chemical thermodynamics. In 1895, he was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 1895. He was also awarded honorary doctorates by Princeton University and Williams College.\nIn Europe, Gibbs was inducted as honorary member of the London Mathematical Society in 1892 and elected Foreign Member of the Royal Society in 1897. He was elected as corresponding member of the Prussian and French Academies of Science and received honorary doctorates from the universities of Dublin, Erlangen, and Christiania (now Oslo). The Royal Society further honored Gibbs in 1901 with the Copley Medal, then regarded as the highest international award in the natural sciences, noting that he had been \"the first to apply the second law of thermodynamics to the exhaustive discussion of the relation between chemical, electrical and thermal energy and capacity for external work.\" Gibbs, who remained in New Haven, was represented at the award ceremony by Commander Richardson Clover, the US naval attach\u00e9 in London.\nIn his autobiography, mathematician Gian-Carlo Rota tells of casually browsing the mathematical stacks of Sterling Library and stumbling on a handwritten mailing list, attached to some of Gibbs's course notes, which listed over two hundred notable scientists of his day, including Poincar\u00e9, Boltzmann, David Hilbert, and Ernst Mach. From this, Rota concluded that Gibbs's work was better known among the scientific elite of his day than the published material suggests. Lynde Wheeler reproduces that mailing list in an appendix to his biography of Gibbs. That Gibbs succeeded in interesting his European correspondents in his work is demonstrated by the fact that his monograph \"On the Equilibrium of Heterogeneous Substances\" was translated into German (then the leading language for chemistry) by Wilhelm Ostwald in 1892 and into French by Henri Louis Le Ch\u00e2telier in 1899.\nInfluence.\nGibbs's most immediate and obvious influence was on physical chemistry and statistical mechanics, two disciplines which he greatly helped to found. During Gibbs's lifetime, his phase rule was experimentally validated by Dutch chemist H. W. Bakhuis Roozeboom, who showed how to apply it in a variety of situations, thereby assuring it of widespread use. In industrial chemistry, Gibbs's thermodynamics found many applications during the early 20th century, from electrochemistry to the development of the Haber process for the synthesis of ammonia.\nWhen Dutch physicist J. D. van der Waals received the 1910 Nobel Prize \"for his work on the equation of state for gases and liquids\" he acknowledged the great influence of Gibbs's work on that subject. Max Planck received the 1918 Nobel Prize for his work on quantum mechanics, particularly his 1900 paper on Planck's law for quantized black-body radiation. That work was based largely on the thermodynamics of Kirchhoff, Boltzmann, and Gibbs. Planck declared that Gibbs's name \"not only in America but in the whole world will ever be reckoned among the most renowned theoretical physicists of all times.\"\nThe first half of the 20th century saw the publication of two influential textbooks that soon came to be regarded as founding documents of chemical thermodynamics, both of which used and extended Gibbs's work in that field: these were \"Thermodynamics and the Free Energy of Chemical Processes\" (1923), by Gilbert N. Lewis and Merle Randall, and \"Modern Thermodynamics by the Methods of Willard Gibbs\" (1933), by Edward A. Guggenheim.\nChemist Frederick G. Donnan compared Gibbs to epoch-making scientists such as Isaac Newton, Joseph-Louis Lagrange and William Rowan Hamilton, stating:&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Gibbs ranks with men like Newton, Lagrange and Hamilton, who by the sheer force and power of their minds have produced those generalized statements of scientific law which mark epochs in the advance of exact knowledge.Physicist Robert Andrews Millikan compared the work of Gibbs to what Pierre-Simon Laplace and James Clerk Maxwell achieved, stating that:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;He did for statistical mechanics and for thermodynamics what Laplace did for celestial mechanics and Maxwell did for electrodynamics, namely, made his field a well-nigh finished theoretical structure.Gibbs's work on statistical ensembles, as presented in his 1902 textbook, has had a great impact in both theoretical physics and in pure mathematics. According to mathematical physicist Arthur Wightman,\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;It is one of the striking features of the work of Gibbs, noticed by every student of thermodynamics and statistical mechanics, that his formulations of physical concepts were so felicitously chosen that they have survived 100 years of turbulent development in theoretical physics and mathematics.\nInitially unaware of Gibbs's contributions in that field, Albert Einstein wrote three papers on statistical mechanics, published between 1902 and 1904. After reading Gibbs's textbook (which was translated into German by Ernst Zermelo in 1905), Einstein declared that Gibbs's treatment was superior to his own and explained that he would not have written those papers if he had known Gibbs's work.\nGibbs's early papers on the use of graphical methods in thermodynamics reflect a powerfully original understanding of what mathematicians would later call \"convex analysis\", including ideas that, according to Barry Simon, \"lay dormant for about seventy-five years\". Important mathematical concepts based on Gibbs's work on thermodynamics and statistical mechanics include the Gibbs lemma in game theory, the Gibbs inequality in information theory, as well as Gibbs sampling in computational statistics.\nThe development of vector calculus was Gibbs's other great contribution to mathematics. The publication in 1901 of E. B. Wilson's textbook \"Vector Analysis\", based on Gibbs's lectures at Yale, did much to propagate the use of vectorial methods and notation in both mathematics and theoretical physics, definitively displacing the quaternions that had until then been dominant in the scientific literature.\nAt Yale, Gibbs was also mentor to Lee De Forest, who went on to invent the triode amplifier and has been called the \"father of radio\". De Forest credited Gibbs's influence for the realization \"that the leaders in electrical development would be those who pursued the higher theory of waves and oscillations and the transmission by these means of intelligence and power.\" Another student of Gibbs who played a significant role in the development of radio technology was Lynde Wheeler.\nGibbs also had an indirect influence on mathematical economics. He supervised the thesis of Irving Fisher, who received the first PhD in economics from Yale in 1891. In that work, published in 1892 as \"Mathematical Investigations in the Theory of Value and Prices\", Fisher drew a direct analogy between Gibbsian equilibrium in physical and chemical systems, and the general equilibrium of markets, and he used Gibbs's vectorial notation. Gibbs's prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Edwin Bidwell Wilson became, in turn, a mentor to leading American economist and Nobel Laureate Paul Samuelson. In 1947, Samuelson published \"Foundations of Economic Analysis\", based on his doctoral dissertation, in which he used as epigraph a remark attributed to Gibbs: \"Mathematics is a language.\" Samuelson later explained that in his understanding of prices his \"debts were not primarily to Pareto or Slutsky, but to the great thermodynamicist, Willard Gibbs of Yale.\"\nMathematician Norbert Wiener cited Gibbs's use of probability in the formulation of statistical mechanics as \"the first great revolution of twentieth century physics\" and as a major influence on his conception of cybernetics. Wiener explained in the preface to his book \"The Human Use of Human Beings\" that it was \"devoted to the impact of the Gibbsian point of view on modern life, both through the substantive changes it has made to working science, and through the changes it has made indirectly in our attitude to life in general.\"\nCommemoration.\nWhen the German physical chemist Walther Nernst visited Yale in 1906 to give the Silliman lecture, he was surprised to find no tangible memorial for Gibbs. Nernst donated his $500 lecture fee to the university to help pay for a suitable monument. This was finally unveiled in 1912, in the form of a bronze bas-relief by sculptor Lee Lawrie, installed in the Sloane Physics Laboratory. In 1910, the American Chemical Society established the Willard Gibbs Award for eminent work in pure or applied chemistry. In 1923, the American Mathematical Society endowed the Josiah Willard Gibbs Lectureship, \"to show the public some idea of the aspects of mathematics and its applications\".\nIn 1945, Yale University created the J. Willard Gibbs Professorship in Theoretical Chemistry, held until 1973 by Lars Onsager. Onsager, who much like Gibbs, focused on applying new mathematical ideas to problems in physical chemistry, won the 1968 Nobel Prize in chemistry. In addition to establishing the Josiah Willard Gibbs Laboratories and the J. Willard Gibbs Assistant Professorship in Mathematics, Yale has also hosted two symposia dedicated to Gibbs's life and work, one in 1989 and another on the centenary of his death, in 2003. Rutgers University endowed a J. Willard Gibbs Professorship of Thermomechanics, held as of 2014 by Bernard Coleman.\nGibbs was elected in 1950 to the Hall of Fame for Great Americans. The oceanographic research ship USNS \"Josiah Willard Gibbs\" (T-AGOR-1) was in service with the United States Navy from 1958 to 1971. Gibbs crater, near the eastern limb of the Moon, was named in the scientist's honor in 1964.\nEdward Guggenheim introduced the symbol \"G\" for the Gibbs free energy in 1933, and this was used also by Dirk ter Haar in 1966. This notation is now universal and is recommended by the IUPAC. In 1960, William Giauque and others suggested the name \"gibbs\" (abbreviated gbs.) for the unit of entropy calorie per kelvin, but this usage did not become common, and the corresponding SI unit joule per kelvin carries no special name.\nIn 1954, a year before his death, Albert Einstein was asked by an interviewer who were the greatest thinkers that he had known. Einstein replied: \"Lorentz\", adding \"I never met Willard Gibbs; perhaps, had I done so, I might have placed him beside Lorentz.\" Author Bill Bryson in his bestselling popular science book \"A Short History of Nearly Everything\" ranks Gibbs as \"perhaps the most brilliant person that most people have never heard of\".\nIn 1958, USS \"San Carlos\" was renamed USNS \"Josiah Willard Gibbs\" and re-designated as an oceanographic research ship.\nIn literature.\nIn 1909, the American historian and novelist Henry Adams finished an essay entitled \"The Rule of Phase Applied to History\", in which he sought to apply Gibbs's phase rule and other thermodynamic concepts to a general theory of human history. William James, Henry Bumstead, and others criticized both Adams's tenuous grasp of the scientific concepts that he invoked, as well as the arbitrariness of his application of those concepts as metaphors for the evolution of human thought and society. The essay remained unpublished until it appeared posthumously in 1919, in \"The Degradation of the Democratic Dogma\", edited by Henry Adams's younger brother Brooks.\nIn the 1930s, feminist poet Muriel Rukeyser became fascinated by Willard Gibbs and wrote a long poem about his life and work (\"Gibbs\", included in the collection \"A Turning Wind\", published in 1939), as well as a book-length biography (\"Willard Gibbs\", 1942). According to Rukeyser:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Willard Gibbs is the type of the imagination at work in the world. His story is that of an opening up which has had its effect on our lives and our thinking; and, it seems to me, it is the emblem of the naked imagination\u2014which is called abstract and impractical, but whose discoveries can be used by anyone who is interested, in whatever \"field\"\u2014an imagination which for me, more than that of any other figure in American thought, any poet, or political, or religious figure, stands for imagination at its essential points.\nIn 1946, \"Fortune\" magazine illustrated a cover story on \"Fundamental Science\" with a representation of the thermodynamic surface that Maxwell had built based on Gibbs's proposal. Rukeyser called this surface a \"statue of water\" and the magazine saw in it \"the abstract creation of a great American scientist that lends itself to the symbolism of contemporary art forms.\" The artwork by Arthur Lidov also included Gibbs's mathematical expression of the phase rule for heterogeneous mixtures, as well as a radar screen, an oscilloscope waveform, Newton's apple, and a small rendition of a three-dimensional phase diagram.\nGibbs's nephew, Ralph Gibbs Van Name, a professor of physical chemistry at Yale, was unhappy with Rukeyser's biography, in part because of her lack of scientific training. Van Name had withheld the family papers from her and, after her book was published in 1942 to positive literary but mixed scientific reviews, he tried to encourage Gibbs's former students to produce a more technically oriented biography. Rukeyser's approach to Gibbs was also sharply criticized by Gibbs's former student and prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Edwin Wilson. With Van Name's and Wilson's encouragement, physicist Lynde Wheeler published a new biography of Gibbs in 1951.\nBoth Gibbs and Rukeyser's biography of him figure prominently in the poetry collection \"True North\" (1997) by Stephanie Strickland. In fiction, Gibbs appears as the mentor to character Kit Traverse in Thomas Pynchon's novel \"Against the Day\" (2006). That novel also prominently discusses the birefringence of Iceland spar, an optical phenomenon that Gibbs investigated.\nGibbs stamp (2005).\nIn 2005, the United States Postal Service issued the \"American Scientists\" commemorative postage stamp series designed by artist Victor Stabin, depicting Gibbs, John von Neumann, Barbara McClintock, and Richard Feynman. The first day of issue ceremony for the series was held on May 4 at Yale University's Luce Hall and was attended by John Marburger, scientific advisor to the president of the United States, Rick Levin, president of Yale, and family members of the scientists honored, including physician John W. Gibbs, a distant cousin of Willard Gibbs.\nKenneth R. Jolls, a professor of chemical engineering at Iowa State University and an expert on graphical methods in thermodynamics, consulted on the design of the stamp honoring Gibbs. The stamp identifies Gibbs as a \"thermodynamicist\" and features a diagram from the 4th edition of Maxwell's \"Theory of Heat\", published in 1875, which illustrates Gibbs's thermodynamic surface for water. Microprinting on the collar of Gibbs's portrait depicts his original mathematical equation for the change in the energy of a substance in terms of its entropy and the other state variables.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nPrimary.\nGibbs's other papers are included in both:"}

A drought can last for days, months or years. Drought often has large impacts on the ecosystems and agriculture of affected regions, and causes harm to the local economy. Annual dry seasons in the tropics significantly increase the chances of a drought developing, with subsequent increased wildfire risks. Heat waves can significantly worsen drought conditions by increasing evapotranspiration. This dries out forests and other vegetation, and increases the amount of fuel for wildfires.\nDrought is a recurring feature of the climate in most parts of the world, becoming more extreme and less predictable due to climate change, which dendrochronological studies date back to 1900. There are three kinds of drought effects, environmental, economic and social. Environmental effects include the drying of wetlands, more and larger wildfires, loss of biodiversity.\nEconomic impacts of drought result due to negative disruptions to agriculture and livestock farming (causing food insecurity), forestry, public water supplies, river navigation (due to e.g.: lower water levels), electric power supply (by affecting hydropower systems) and impacts on human health.\nSocial and health costs include the negative effect on the health of people directly exposed to this phenomenon (excessive heat waves), high food costs, stress caused by failed harvests, water scarcity, etc. Drought can also lead to increased air pollution due to increased dust concentrations and wildfires. Prolonged droughts have caused mass migrations and humanitarian crisis.\nExamples for regions with increased drought risks are the Amazon basin, Australia, the Sahel region and India. For example, in 2005, parts of the Amazon basin experienced the worst drought in 100 years. Australia could experience more severe droughts and they could become more frequent in the future, a government-commissioned report said on July 6, 2008. The long Australian Millennial drought broke in 2010. The 2020\u20132022 Horn of Africa drought surpassed the severe drought in 2010\u20132011 in both duration and severity. \nThroughout history, humans have usually viewed droughts as disasters due to the impact on food availability and the rest of society. People have viewed drought as a natural disaster or as something influenced by human activity, or as a result of supernatural forces.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nDefinition.\nThe IPCC Sixth Assessment Report defines a drought simply as \"drier than normal conditions\". This means that a drought is \"a moisture deficit relative to the average water availability at a given location and season\".\nAccording to National Integrated Drought Information System, a multi-agency partnership, drought is generally defined as \"a deficiency of precipitation over an extended period of time (usually a season or more), resulting in a water shortage\". The National Weather Service office of the NOAA defines drought as \"a deficiency of moisture that results in adverse impacts on people, animals, or vegetation over a sizeable area\".\nDrought is a complex phenomenon \u2212 relating to the absence of water \u2212 which is difficult to monitor and define. By the early 1980s, over 150 definitions of \"drought\" had already been published. The range of definitions reflects differences in regions, needs, and disciplinary approaches.\nCategories.\nThere are three major categories of drought based on where in the water cycle the moisture deficit occurs: meteorological drought, hydrological drought, and agricultural or ecological drought. A meteorological drought occurs due to lack of precipitation. A hydrological drought is related to low runoff, streamflow, and reservoir and groundwater storage. An agricultural or ecological drought is causing plant stress from a combination of evaporation and low soil moisture. Some organizations add another category: socioeconomic drought occurs when the demand for an economic good exceeds supply as a result of a weather-related shortfall in water supply. The socioeconomic drought is a similar concept to water scarcity.\nThe different categories of droughts have different causes but similar effects:\nIndices and monitoring.\nSeveral indices have been defined to quantify and monitor drought at different spatial and temporal scales. A key property of drought indices is their spatial comparability, and they must be statistically robust. Drought indices include:\nHigh-resolution drought information helps to better assess the spatial and temporal changes and variability in drought duration, severity, and magnitude at a much finer scale. This supports the development of site-specific adaptation measures.\nThe application of multiple indices using different datasets helps to better manage and monitor droughts than using a single dataset, This is particularly the case in regions of the world where not enough data is available such as Africa and South America. Using a single dataset can be limiting, as it may not capture the full spectrum of drought characteristics and impacts.\nCareful monitoring of moisture levels can also help predict increased risk for wildfires.\nCauses.\nGeneral precipitation deficiency.\nMechanisms of producing precipitation include convective, stratiform, and orographic rainfall. Convective processes involve strong vertical motions that can cause the overturning of the atmosphere in that location within an hour and cause heavy precipitation, while stratiform processes involve weaker upward motions and less intense precipitation over a longer duration.\nPrecipitation can be divided into three categories, based on whether it falls as liquid water, liquid water that freezes on contact with the surface, or ice.\nDroughts occur mainly in areas where normal levels of rainfall are, in themselves, low. If these factors do not support precipitation volumes sufficiently to reach the surface over a sufficient time, the result is a drought. Drought can be triggered by a high level of reflected sunlight and above average prevalence of high pressure systems, winds carrying continental, rather than oceanic air masses, and ridges of high pressure areas aloft can prevent or restrict the developing of thunderstorm activity or rainfall over one certain region. Once a region is within drought, feedback mechanisms such as local arid air, hot conditions which can promote warm core ridging, and minimal evapotranspiration can worsen drought conditions.\nDry season.\nWithin the tropics, distinct, wet and dry seasons emerge due to the movement of the Intertropical Convergence Zone or Monsoon trough. The dry season greatly increases drought occurrence, and is characterized by its low humidity, with watering holes and rivers drying up. Because of the lack of these watering holes, many grazing animals are forced to migrate due to the lack of water in search of more fertile lands. Examples of such animals are zebras, elephants, and wildebeest. Because of the lack of water in the plants, bushfires are common. Since water vapor becomes more energetic with increasing temperature, more water vapor is required to increase relative humidity values to 100% at higher temperatures (or to get the temperature to fall to the dew point). Periods of warmth quicken the pace of fruit and vegetable production, increase evaporation and transpiration from plants, and worsen drought conditions.\nEl Ni\u00f1o\u2013Southern Oscillation (ENSO).\nThe El Ni\u00f1o\u2013Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phenomenon can sometimes play a significant role in drought. ENSO comprises two patterns of temperature anomalies in the central Pacific Ocean, known as La Ni\u00f1a and El Ni\u00f1o. La Ni\u00f1a events are generally associated with drier and hotter conditions and further exacerbation of drought in California and the Southwestern United States, and to some extent the U.S. Southeast. Meteorological scientists have observed that La Ni\u00f1as have become more frequent over time.\nConversely, during El Ni\u00f1o events, drier and hotter weather occurs in parts of the Amazon River Basin, Colombia, and Central America. Winters during the El Ni\u00f1o are warmer and drier than average conditions in the Northwest, northern Midwest, and northern Mideast United States, so those regions experience reduced snowfalls. Conditions are also drier than normal from December to February in south-central Africa, mainly in Zambia, Zimbabwe, Mozambique, and Botswana. Direct effects of El Ni\u00f1o resulting in drier conditions occur in parts of Southeast Asia and Northern Australia, increasing bush fires, worsening haze, and decreasing air quality dramatically. Drier-than-normal conditions are also in general observed in Queensland, inland Victoria, inland New South Wales, and eastern Tasmania from June to August. As warm water spreads from the west Pacific and the Indian Ocean to the east Pacific, it causes extensive drought in the western Pacific. Singapore experienced the driest February in 2014 since records began in 1869, with only 6.3\u00a0mm of rain falling in the month and temperatures hitting as high as 35\u00a0\u00b0C on 26 February. The years 1968 and 2005 had the next driest Februaries, when 8.4\u00a0mm of rain fell.\nClimate change.\nGlobally, the occurrence of droughts has increased as a result of the increase in temperature and atmospheric evaporative demand. In addition, increased climate variability has increased the frequency and severity of drought events. Moreover, the occurrence and impact of droughts are aggravated by anthropogenic activities such as land use change and water management and demand.\nThe IPCC Sixth Assessment Report also pointed out that \"Warming over land drives an increase in atmospheric evaporative demand and in the severity of drought events\" and \"Increased atmospheric evaporative demand increases plant water stress, leading to agricultural and ecological drought\".\nThere is a rise of compound warm-season droughts in Europe that are concurrent with an increase in potential evapotranspiration.\nVegetation changes, erosion and human activities.\nHuman activity can directly trigger exacerbating factors such as over-farming, excessive irrigation, deforestation, and erosion adversely impact the ability of the land to capture and hold water. In arid climates, the main source of erosion is wind. Erosion can be the result of material movement by the wind. The wind can cause small particles to be lifted and therefore moved to another region (deflation). Suspended particles within the wind may impact on solid objects causing erosion by abrasion (ecological succession). Wind erosion generally occurs in areas with little or no vegetation, often in areas where there is insufficient rainfall to support vegetation. Woody plant encroachment can increase soil porosity and therewith the chances of soil drought.\nImpacts.\nDrought is one of the most complex and major natural hazards, and it has devastating impacts on the environment, economy, water resources, agriculture, and society worldwide.\nOne can divide the impacts of droughts and water shortages into three groups: environmental, economic and social (including health).\nEnvironmental and economic impacts.\nEnvironmental effects of droughts include: lower surface and subterranean water-levels, lower flow-levels (with a decrease below the minimum leading to direct danger for amphibian life), increased pollution of surface water, the drying out of wetlands, more and larger wildfires, higher deflation intensity, loss of biodiversity, worse health of trees and the appearance of pests and dendroid diseases. Drought-induced mortality of trees lacks in most climate models in their representation of forests as land carbon sink.\nEconomic losses as a result of droughts include lower agricultural, forests, game and fishing output, higher food-production costs, lower energy-production levels in hydro plants, losses caused by depleted water tourism and transport revenue, problems with water supply for the energy sector and for technological processes in metallurgy, mining, the chemical, paper, wood, foodstuff industries etc., disruption of water supplies for municipal economies.\nFurther examples of common environmental and economic consequences of drought include:\nAgricultural impacts.\nDroughts can cause land degradation and loss of soil moisture, resulting in the destruction of cropland productivity. This can result in diminished crop growth or yield productions and carrying capacity for livestock. Drought in combination with high levels of grazing pressure can function as the tipping point for an ecosystem, causing woody encroachment.\nWater stress affects plant development and quality in a variety of ways: firstly drought can cause poor germination and impaired seedling development. At the same time plant growth relies on cellular division, cell enlargement, and differentiation. Drought stress impairs mitosis and cell elongation via loss of turgor pressure which results in poor growth. Development of leaves is also dependent upon turgor pressure, concentration of nutrients, and carbon assimilates all of which are reduced by drought conditions, thus drought stress lead to a decrease in leaf size and number. Plant height, biomass, leaf size and stem girth has been shown to decrease in maize under water limiting conditions. Crop yield is also negatively effected by drought stress, the reduction in crop yield results from a decrease in photosynthetic rate, changes in leaf development, and altered allocation of resources all due to drought stress. Crop plants exposed to drought stress suffer from reductions in leaf water potential and transpiration rate. Water-use efficiency increases in crops such as wheat while decreasing in others, such as potatoes.\nPlants need water for the uptake of nutrients from the soil, and for the transport of nutrients throughout the plant: drought conditions limit these functions leading to stunted growth. Drought stress also causes a decrease in photosynthetic activity in plants due to the reduction of photosynthetic tissues, stomatal closure, and reduced performance of photosynthetic machinery. This reduction in photosynthetic activity contributes to the reduction in plant growth and yields. Another factor influencing reduced plant growth and yields include the allocation of resources; following drought stress plants will allocate more resources to roots to aid in water uptake increasing root growth and reducing the growth of other plant parts while decreasing yields.\nSocial and health impacts.\nThe most negative impacts of drought for humans include crop failure, food crisis, famine, malnutrition, and poverty, which lead to loss of life and mass migration of people.\nThere are negative effects on the health of people who are directly exposed to this phenomenon (excessive heat waves). Droughts can also cause limitations of water supplies, increased water pollution levels, high food-costs, stress caused by failed harvests, water scarcity, etc. Reduced water quality can occur because lower water-flows reduce dilution of pollutants and increase contamination of remaining water sources.\nThis explains why droughts and water scarcity operate as a factor which increases the gap between developed and developing countries.\nEffects vary according to vulnerability. For example, subsistence farmers are more likely to migrate during drought because they do not have alternative food-sources. Areas with populations that depend on water sources as a major food-source are more vulnerable to famine.\nFurther examples of social and health consequences include:\nSevere drought has been noted to cause unrest and precede in some cases periods of political upheaval.\nLoss of fertile soils.\nWind erosion is much more severe in arid areas and during times of drought. For example, in the Great Plains, it is estimated that soil loss due to wind erosion can be as much as 6100 times greater in drought years than in wet years.\nLoess is a homogeneous, typically nonstratified, porous, friable, slightly coherent, often calcareous, fine-grained, silty, pale yellow or buff, windblown (Aeolian) sediment. It generally occurs as a widespread blanket deposit that covers areas of hundreds of square kilometers and tens of meters thick. Loess often stands in either steep or vertical faces. Loess tends to develop into highly rich soils. Under appropriate climatic conditions, areas with loess are among the most agriculturally productive in the world. Loess deposits are geologically unstable by nature, and will erode very readily. Therefore, windbreaks (such as big trees and bushes) are often planted by farmers to reduce the wind erosion of loess.\nRegions particularly affected.\nAmazon basin.\nIn 2005, parts of the Amazon basin experienced the worst drought in 100 years. A 2006 article reported results showing that the forest in its present form could survive only three years of drought. Scientists at the Brazilian National Institute of Amazonian Research argue in the article that this drought response, coupled with the effects of deforestation on regional climate, are pushing the rainforest towards a \"tipping point\" where it would irreversibly start to die. It concludes that the rainforest is on the brink of being turned into savanna or desert, with catastrophic consequences for the world's climate. According to the WWF, the combination of climate change and deforestation increases the drying effect of dead trees that fuels forest fires.\nAustralia.\nThe 1997\u20132009 Millennium Drought in Australia led to a water supply crisis across much of the country. As a result, many desalination plants were built for the first time (see list).\nBy far the largest part of Australia is desert or semi-arid lands commonly known as the outback. A 2005 study by Australian and American researchers investigated the desertification of the interior, and suggested that one explanation was related to human settlers who arrived about 50,000 years ago. Regular burning by these settlers could have prevented monsoons from reaching interior Australia. In June 2008 it became known that an expert panel had warned of long term, maybe irreversible, severe ecological damage for the whole Murray-Darling basin if it did not receive sufficient water by October 2008. Australia could experience more severe droughts and they could become more frequent in the future, a government-commissioned report said on July 6, 2008. Australian environmentalist Tim Flannery, predicted that unless it made drastic changes, Perth in Western Australia could become the world's first ghost metropolis, an abandoned city with no more water to sustain its population. The long Australian Millennial drought broke in 2010.\nEast Africa.\nEast Africa, including for example Ethiopia, Eritrea, Kenya, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, Tanzania, and Uganda, has a diverse climate, ranging from hot, dry regions to cooler, wetter highland regions. The region has considerable variability in seasonal rainfall and a very complex topography. In the northern parts of the region within the Nile basin (Ethiopia, Sudan), the rainfall is characterized by an unimodal cycle with a wet season from July to September. The rest of the region has a bimodal annual cycle, featuring long rains from March to May and the short rains from October to December. The frequent occurrence of hydrological extremes, like droughts and floods, harms the already vulnerable population suffering from severe poverty and economic turmoil. Droughts prompted food shortages for example in 1984\u201385, 2006 and 2011.\nThe Eastern African region experiences the impacts of climate change in different forms. For instance, below-average rainfall occurred for six consecutive rainy seasons in the Horn of Africa during the period 2020\u20132023 leading to the third longest and most widespread drought on record with dire implications for food security (see Horn of Africa drought (2020\u2013present)). Conversely, other parts experienced extreme floods, e.g., the 2020 East Africa floods in Ethiopia, Rwanda, Kenya, Burundi, and Uganda, and the 2022 floods in South Sudan.\nA key feature in the region is the heterogeneous distribution of hydrologic extremes in space and time. For instance, El Ni\u00f1o can cause droughts in one part of the region and floods in the other. This is also a common situation within a country, e.g., in Ethiopia. The recent years with consecutive droughts followed by floods are a testament to the need to better forecast these kinds of events and their impacts.\nHimalayan river basins.\nApproximately 2.4\u00a0billion people live in the drainage basin of the Himalayan rivers. India, China, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal and Myanmar could experience floods followed by droughts in coming decades. Drought in India affecting the Ganges is of particular concern, as it provides drinking water and agricultural irrigation for more than 500\u00a0million people. In 2025, the UN warned that retreating glaciers could threaten the food and water supply of 2 billion people worldwide.\nNorth America.\nThe west coast of North America, which gets much of its water from glaciers in mountain ranges such as the Rocky Mountains and Sierra Nevada, also would be affected.\nBy country or region.\nDroughts in particular countries:\nSee also:\nProtection, mitigation and relief.\nAgriculturally, people can effectively mitigate much of the impact of drought through irrigation and crop rotation. Failure to develop adequate drought mitigation strategies carries a grave human cost in the modern era, exacerbated by ever-increasing population densities.\nStrategies for drought protection or mitigation include:\nWhen water is scarce due to droughts, there are a range of options for people to access other sources of water, such as wastewater reuse, rainwater harvesting and stormwater recovery, or seawater desalination.\nHistory.\nThroughout history, humans have usually viewed droughts as disasters due to the impact on food availability and the rest of society. Drought is among the earliest documented climatic events, present in the Epic of Gilgamesh and tied to the Biblical story of Joseph's arrival in and the later Exodus from ancient Egypt. Hunter-gatherer migrations in 9,500 BC Chile have been linked to the phenomenon, as has the exodus of early humans out of Africa and into the rest of the world around 135,000 years ago.\nDroughts can be scientifically explained in terms of physical mechanisms, which underlie natural disasters and are influenced by human impact on the environment.\nBeliefs about drought are further shaped by cultural factors including local knowledge, perceptions, values, beliefs and religion. In some places and times, droughts have been interpreted as the work of supernatural forces. Globally, people in many societies have been more likely to explain natural events like drought, famine and disease in terms of the supernatural than they are to explain social phenomena like war, murder, and theft.\nHistorically, rituals have been used in an attempt to prevent or avert drought. Rainmaking rituals have ranged from dances to scapegoating to human sacrifices. Many ancient practices are now a matter of folklore while others may still be practiced.\nIn areas where people have limited understanding of the scientific basis of drought, beliefs about drought continue to reflect indigenous beliefs in the power of spirits and Christian philosophies that see drought as a divine punishment. Such beliefs can influence people's thinking and affect their resilience and ability to adapt to stress and respond to crises. In the case of Creationism, curricula sometimes give religious explanations of natural phenomena rather than scientific ones. Teaching explicitly denies evolution, that human agency is affecting climate, and that climate change is occurring.\nSome historical droughts include:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The leap years that were actually observed between the implementation of the Julian calendar in 45\u00a0BC and AD\u00a08 were erratic (see the Julian calendar article for details).\nA calendar obtained by extension earlier in time than its invention or implementation is called the \"proleptic\" version of the calendar. Likewise, the proleptic Gregorian calendar is occasionally used to specify dates before the introduction of the Gregorian calendar in 1582. Because the Julian calendar was used before that time, one must explicitly state that a given quoted date is based on the proleptic Gregorian calendar if that is the case.\nThe Julian calendar itself was introduced by Julius Caesar, and as such is older than the introduction of the Anno Domini era (or the \"Common Era\"), counting years since the birth of Christ as calculated by Dionysus Exiguus in the 6th century, and widely used in medieval European annals since about the 8th century, notably by Bede. The proleptic Julian calendar uses Anno Domini throughout, including for dates of Late Antiquity when the Julian calendar was in use but Anno Domini was not, and for times predating the introduction of the Julian calendar.\nYears are given cardinal numbers, using inclusive counting (AD\u00a01 is the first year of the Anno Domini era, immediately preceded by 1\u00a0BC, the first year preceding the Anno Domini era; there is no \"zeroth\" year).\nThus, the year 1\u00a0BC of the proleptic Julian calendar is a leap year.\nThis is to be distinguished from the astronomical year numbering, introduced in 1740 by French astronomer Jacques Cassini, which considers each New Year an integer on a time axis, with year 0 corresponding to 1\u00a0BC, and \"year \u22121\" corresponding to 2\u00a0BC, so that in this system, Julian leap years have a number divisible by four.\nThe determination of leap years in the proleptic Julian calendar (in either numbering) is distinct from the question of which years were historically considered leap years during the Roman era, due to the leap year error: Between 45\u00a0BC and AD\u00a08, the leap day was somewhat unsystematic. Thus there is no simple way to find an equivalent in the proleptic Julian calendar of a date quoted using either the Roman pre-Julian calendar or the Julian calendar before AD\u00a08. The year 46\u00a0BC itself is a special case: because of the historical introduction of the Julian calendar in that year, it was allotted 445 days. Before then, the Roman Republican calendar used a system of intercalary months rather than leap days."}

A soldier can be a conscripted or volunteer enlisted person, a non-commissioned officer, a warrant officer, or an officer.\nEtymology.\nThe word \"soldier\" derives from the Middle English word , from Old French or , meaning mercenary, from , meaning shilling's worth or wage, from or , shilling. The word is also related to the Medieval Latin , meaning soldier (lit.\u2009'one having pay'). These words ultimately derive from the Late Latin word , referring to an ancient Roman coin used in the Byzantine Empire.\nOccupational and other designations.\nIn most armies, the word \"soldier\" has a general meaning that refers to all members of an army, distinct from more specialized military occupations that require different areas of knowledge and skill sets. \"Soldiers\" may be referred to by titles, names, nicknames, or acronyms that reflect an individual's military occupation specialty arm, service, or branch of military employment, their type of unit, or operational employment or technical use such as: trooper, tanker (a member of tank crew), commando, dragoon, infantryman, guardsman, artilleryman, paratrooper, grenadier, ranger, sniper, engineer, sapper, craftsman, signaller, medic, rifleman, or gunner, among other terms. Some of these designations or their etymological origins have existed in the English language for centuries, while others are relatively recent, reflecting changes in technology, increased division of labor, or other factors. In the United States Army, a soldier's military job is designated as a Military Occupational Specialty (MOS), which includes a very wide array of MOS Branches and sub-specialties. One example of a nickname for a soldier in a specific occupation is the term \"red caps\" to refer to military policemen personnel in the British Army because of the colour of their headgear.\nInfantry are sometimes called \"grunts\" in the United States Army (as the well as in the U.S. Marine Corps) or \"squaddies\" (in the British Army). U.S. Army artillery crews, or \"gunners,\" are sometimes referred to as \"redlegs\", from the service branch colour for artillery. U.S. soldiers are often called \"G.I.s\" (short for the term \"Government Issue\"). Such terms may be associated with particular wars or historical eras. \"G.I.\" came into common use during World War II and after, but prior to and during World War I especially, American soldiers were called \"Doughboys,\" while British infantry troops were often referred to as \"Tommies\" (short for the archetypal soldier \"Tommy Atkins\") and French infantry were called \"Poilus\" (\"hairy ones\").\nSome formal or informal designations may reflect the status or changes in status of soldiers for reasons of gender, race, or other social factors. With certain exceptions, service as a soldier, especially in the infantry, had generally been restricted to males throughout world history. By World War II, women were actively deployed in Allied forces in different ways. Some notable female soldiers in the Soviet Union were honored as \"Heroes of the Soviet Union\" for their actions in the army or as partisan fighters. In the United Kingdom, women served in the Auxiliary Territorial Service (ATS) and later in the Women's Royal Army Corps (WRAC). Soon after its entry into the war, the U.S. formed the Women's Army Corps, whose female soldiers were often referred to as \"WACs.\" These sex-segregated branches were disbanded in the last decades of the twentieth century and women soldiers were integrated into the standing branches of the military, although their ability to serve in armed combat was often restricted. \nRace has historically been an issue restricting the ability of some people to serve in the U.S. Army. Until the American Civil War, Black soldiers fought in integrated and sometimes separate units, but at other times were not allowed to serve, largely due to fears about the possible effects of such service on the institution of legal slavery. Some Black soldiers, both freemen and men who had escaped from slavery, served in Union forces, until 1863, when the Emancipation Proclamation opened the door for the formation of Black units. After the war, Black soldiers continued to serve, but in segregated units, often subjected to physical and verbal racist abuse. The term \"Buffalo Soldiers\" was applied to some units fighting in the 19th century Indian Wars in the American West. Eventually, the phrase was applied more generally to segregated Black units, who often distinguished themselves in armed conflict and other service. In 1948, President Harry S. Truman issued an executive order for the end of segregation in the United States Armed Forces.\nService.\nConscription.\nThroughout history, individuals have often been compelled by force or law to serve in armies and other armed forces in times of war or other times. Modern forms of such compulsion are generally referred to as \"conscription\" or a \"draft\". Currently, many countries require registration for some form of mandatory service, although that requirement may be selectively enforced or exist only in law and not in practice. Usually the requirement applies to male citizens. In times of war, the requirements, such as age, may be broadened when additional troops are thought to be needed. \nAt different times and places, some individuals have been able to avoid conscription by having another person take their place. Modern draft laws may provide temporary or permanent exemptions from service or allow some other non-combatant service, as in the case of conscientious objectors.\nIn the United States, males aged 18-25 are required to register with the Selective Service System, which has responsibility for overseeing the draft. However, no draft has occurred since 1973, and the U.S. military has been able to maintain staffing through voluntary enlistment.\nEnlistment.\nSoldiers in war may have various motivations for voluntarily enlisting and remaining in an army or other armed forces branch. In a study of 18th century soldiers' written records about their time in service, historian Ilya Berkovich suggests \"three primary 'levers' of motivation ... 'coercive', 'remunerative', and 'normative' incentives.\" Berkovich argues that historians' assumptions that fear of coercive force kept unwilling conscripts in check and controlled rates of desertion have been overstated and that any pay or other remuneration for service as provided then would have been an insufficient incentive. Instead, \"old-regime common soldiers should be viewed primarily as willing participants who saw themselves as engaged in a distinct and honourable activity.\" In modern times, soldiers have volunteered for armed service, especially in time of war, out of a sense of patriotic duty to their homeland or to advance a social, political, or ideological cause, while improved levels of remuneration or training might be more of an incentive in times of economic hardship. Soldiers might also enlist for personal reasons, such as following family or social expectations, or for the order and discipline provided by military training, as well as for the friendship and connection with their fellow soldiers afforded by close contact in a common enterprise.\nIn 2018, the RAND Corporation published the results of a study of contemporary American soldiers in \"Life as a Private: A Study of the Motivations and Experiences of Junior Enlisted Personnel in the U.S. Army\". The study found that \"soldiers join the Army for family, institutional, and occupational reasons, and many value the opportunity to become a military professional. They value their relationships with other soldiers, enjoy their social lives, and are satisfied with Army life.\" However, the authors cautioned that the survey sample consisted of only 81 soldiers and that \"the findings of this study cannot be generalized to the U.S. Army as a whole or to any rank.\"\nLength of service.\nThe length of time that an individual is required to serve as a soldier has varied with country and historical period, whether that individual has been drafted or has voluntarily enlisted. Such service, depending on the army's need for staffing or the individual's fitness and eligibility, may involve fulfillment of a contractual obligation. That obligation might extend for the duration of an armed conflict or may be limited to a set number of years in active duty and/or inactive duty. \nAs of 2023, service in the U.S. Army is for a Military Service Obligation of 2 to 6 years of active duty with a remaining term in the Individual Ready Reserve. Individuals may also enlist for part-time duty in the Army Reserve or National Guard. Depending on need or fitness to serve, soldiers usually may reenlist for another term, possibly receiving monetary or other incentives.\nIn the U.S. Army, career soldiers who have completed at least 20 years of service are eligible to receive a retirement pension. The size of the pension as a percentage of the soldier's salary usually increases with the length of time served on active duty.\nIn media and popular culture.\nSince the earliest recorded history, soldiers and warfare have been depicted in countless works, including songs, folk tales, stories, memoirs, biographies, novels and other narrative fiction, drama, films, and more recently television and video, comic books, graphic novels, and games. Often these portrayals have emphasized the heroic qualities of soldiers in war, but at times have emphasized war's inherent dangers, confusions, and trauma and their effect on individual soldiers and others.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He was educated at Manhattan's High School of Music and Art, Queens College and Princeton University, studying with George Perle and Milton Babbitt, among others. He received his Ph.D. in music from Princeton in 1973. His doctoral dissertation consisted of an essay titled \"Affine music\" and a composition for string quartet. Originally intending to pursue a career in performance, during 1965\u201366 he played the French horn with the Dorian Wind Quintet. He left the group to attend graduate school. From 1969 until his retirement in 2014 he was on the faculty at Princeton University where he retired as the William Shubael Conant Professor of Music. He chaired the Department from 1991\u20132000. In 2000 he received a lifetime achievement award from the Society for Electro-Acoustic Music in the United States. In 2009\u201310 he was the inaugural composer in residence with the Alabama Symphony. In 2016 he was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Letters. He has received grants and awards from the Guggenheim Foundation, the Fromm Foundation and the Koussevitsky Foundation, the National Endowment for the Arts and Chamber Music America, among others.\nComputer music.\nBeginning in the mid 1960s Lansky was among the first to experiment with the computer for sound synthesis. Until 2004 this was his predominant focus. Since then he has alternated between instrumental composition and electronic music.\nSounds originating from \"real-world\" sources are the predominant focus of Lansky's computer music: traffic, kids in the kitchen, musical instruments, and most of all speech. Electronic synthesis is frequently used but the main sonic resources are transformations of recorded natural sounds. One of his first large pieces, \"Six Fantasies on a Poem by Thomas Campion\" (1979) set the stage. It is based on a reading by his wife Hannah MacKay of a famous poem. The piece is not so much a setting of the poem as it is a study of the contours of a live reading of the poem. The work uses a technique known as linear predictive coding, LPC, which was developed in the 1960s by scientists as a data-reduction technique meant to economize on the amount of data needed for digital voice transmission and is used today in some cell phone communication. It allows for the separation of pitch and speed and the pitch contours of the speech can be altered independently of the speed. Each of the six movements explores a different aspect of speech. This led to a series of \"chatter\" pieces, \"Idle Chatter\", etc. that fragment the speech into a percussive rap-like texture. Other projects included folksong settings (\"Folk Images\"), a portrait of a woman (\"Things She Carried\"), a contemplation of letters and numbers (\"Alphabet Book\"), sounds of the highway (\"Night Traffic\", \"Ride\"), blues harmonica, electric guitar, piano improvisation and casual conversation. The bulk of his approximately 70 electronic compositions are contained on ten solo CDs (see Discography). While there are a few pieces for electronics and live instruments the bulk of Lansky's pieces are recorded \"tape\" pieces.\nLansky's works have attracted interest in various realms. They have been used by dance companies (Bill T. Jones, Eliot Feld Ballet, New York City Ballet). His works frequently have a rhythmic \"groove\" that is attractive to dancers. In 2000 he was the co-subject (along with Francis Dhomont) of a documentary film made for the European Arte network by Uli Aum\u00fcller, \"My Cinema for the Ears\" that deals with the use of natural sounds. A four-chord sequence from Lansky's first large computer piece \"Mild und leise\" (1972) was sampled by the English rock band Radiohead for the track \"Idioteque\" on their 2000 \"Kid A\" album.\nSoftware.\nLansky used any available computing hardware: IBM mainframes at first (1966\u201384), then mini and micro computers by DEC, (1984\u201389), and finally personal computers by NeXT, Silicon Graphics and Apple Computer. During the mainframe era computer time was scarce and expensive, and this prompted Lansky to write his own software package called \"Mix\", in Fortran. This made it easier to assemble a composition voice-by-voice, section-by-section, even note-by-note, avoiding large expensive runs to create an entire piece at once. Mix had no scheduler (meaning that it could create notes in any order) and thus was not suitable for real-time synthesis. Mix used additive writes to the output device, analogous to overdubbing on tape. When the move was made to minis and micros, Lansky ported Mix to the C programming language and called it CMix. During the late 1990s a group led by Brad Garton at Columbia University created a version with a scheduler, RtCmix, that was capable of real time synthesis. Starting in the mid 1990s Lansky used a well-known software package called SuperCollider. Programs like Cmix and SuperCollider are script-based rather than driven by a graphical interface. (Input data is frequently in the form of a program rather than a note list.) This facilitated the creation of complex textures in works such as Idle Chatter, which contain thousands of short notes, frequently selected using random methods. This is sometimes called algorithmic composition.\nInstrumental music.\nDuring the mid 1990s Lansky began to be approached by performers who were attracted to the performative-like aspects of his computer music. Percussionists in particular were attracted by pieces such as \"Table\u2019s Clear\", which resembles a gamelan made of pots and pans, and the \"chatter\" series. One of his first large percussion pieces was \"Threads\", 2005, written for the S\u014d Percussion quartet. Since then there are about a dozen pieces for percussion instruments, alone and in various ensembles. Another focus has been classical guitar, alone and in combination: \"Semi-Suite\", \"With the Grain\" (concerto), Partita (guitar and percussion.) A residency with the Alabama Symphony led to several orchestral pieces (\"Shapeshifters\", \"Imaginary Islands\"). Significant commissions came from the Library of Congress and the Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center for the wind quintet \"The Long and Short of It\", and Chamber Music America for a trio for the Janus Trio, \"Book of Memory\", and for S\u014d Percussion, \"Springs\". The 2004 trio for horn, violin and piano, \"Etudes and Parodies\" won the 2005 International Horn Society prize. Lansky's instrumental music is published by Carl Fischer. The bulk of his computer music as well as much instrumental music is available on Bridge Records.\nHarmony.\nMost of Lansky's works are basically tonal. In general terms this means the apparent background source for his pitch language is the diatonic scale rather than the chromatic or microtonal scale. He frequently uses traditional tonal syntax. During 1969\u201372 he collaborated with George Perle on an expansion of Perle's 12-tone tonality, which led to Perle's book of the same name. This approach basically establishes another metric for measuring and relating harmonies that has to do with symmetry. It is related to some music by Bartok. Some of Lansky's work such as \"Notes to Self\", for piano, and \"It All Adds Up\", for two pianos, use this approach. Lansky's instrumental music generally eschews extended instrumental techniques. He writes that he scratched that itch with computer music.\nA long-term interest of Lansky's is music \"about\" music. Earlier examples of this are his computer pieces \"Guy's Harp\", about blues harmonica, and \"Not So Heavy Metal\", about rock and roll guitar. More recent examples are \"Book of Memory\", which comments on music from Machaut to Scriabin, \"Ancient Echoes\", based on late-16th-century dance music, and \"Ricercare Plus\", inspired by 17th-century counterpoint.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He published more than 1,200 papers and books, of which about 850 dealt with scientific topics. \"New Scientist\" called him one of the 20 greatest scientists of all time. For his scientific work, Pauling was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1954. For his peace activism, he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1962. He is one of five people to have won more than one Nobel Prize. Of these, he is the only person to have been awarded two unshared Nobel Prizes, and one of two people to be awarded Nobel Prizes in different fields, the other being Marie Sk\u0142odowska-Curie.\nPauling was one of the founders of the fields of quantum chemistry and molecular biology. His contributions to the theory of the chemical bond include the concept of orbital hybridisation and the first accurate scale of electronegativities of the elements. Pauling also worked on the structures of biological molecules, and showed the importance of the alpha helix and beta sheet in protein secondary structure. Pauling's approach combined methods and results from X-ray crystallography, molecular model building, and quantum chemistry. His discoveries inspired the work of Rosalind Franklin, James Watson, Francis Crick, and Maurice Wilkins on the structure of DNA, which in turn made it possible for geneticists to crack the DNA code of all organisms.\nIn his later years, he promoted nuclear disarmament, as well as orthomolecular medicine, megavitamin therapy, and dietary supplements, especially ascorbic acid (commonly known as Vitamin C). None of his ideas concerning the medical usefulness of large doses of vitamins have gained much acceptance in the mainstream scientific community. He was married to the American human rights activist Ava Helen Pauling.\nEarly life and education.\nLinus Carl Pauling was born on February 28, 1901, in Portland, Oregon, the firstborn child of Herman Henry William Pauling (1876\u20131910) and Lucy Isabelle \"Belle\" Darling (1881\u20131926). He was named \"Linus Carl\", in honor of Lucy's father, Linus, and Herman's father, Carl. His ancestry included German and English.\nIn 1902, after his sister Pauline was born, Pauling's parents decided to move out of Portland to find more affordable and spacious living quarters than their one-room apartment. Lucy stayed with her husband's parents in Oswego until Herman brought the family to Salem, where he worked briefly as a traveling salesman for the Skidmore Drug Company. Within a year of Lucile's birth in 1904, Herman Pauling moved his family to Oswego, Oregon where he opened his own drugstore.4 He moved his family to Condon, Oregon, in 1905.5 By 1906, Herman Pauling was suffering from recurrent abdominal pain. He died of a perforated ulcer on June 11, 1910, leaving Lucy to care for Linus, Lucile and Pauline.9\nPauling attributes his interest in becoming a chemist to being amazed by experiments conducted by a friend, Lloyd A. Jeffress, who had a small chemistry lab kit.17 He later wrote: \"I was simply entranced by chemical phenomena, by the reactions in which substances, often with strikingly different properties, appear; and I hoped to learn more and more about this aspect of the world.\"\nIn high school, Pauling conducted chemistry experiments by scavenging equipment and material from an abandoned steel plant. With an older friend, Lloyd Simon, Pauling set up Palmon Laboratories in Simon's basement. They approached local dairies offering to perform butterfat samplings at cheap prices but dairymen were wary of trusting two boys with the task, and the business ended in failure.21\nAt age 15, the high school senior had enough credits to enter Oregon State University (OSU), known then as Oregon Agricultural College.22 Lacking two American history courses required for his high school diploma, Pauling asked the school principal if he could take the courses concurrently during the spring semester. Denied, he left Washington High School in June without a diploma.48 The school awarded him an honorary diploma 45 years later, after he was awarded two Nobel Prizes.\nPauling held a number of jobs to earn money for his future college expenses, including working part-time at a grocery store for per week (equivalent to in 2024). His mother arranged an interview with the owner of a number of manufacturing plants in Portland, Mr. Schwietzerhoff, who hired him as an apprentice machinist at a salary of per month (equivalent to in 2024). This was soon raised to per month.23 Pauling also set up a photography laboratory with two friends.24 In September 1917, Pauling was finally admitted by Oregon State University. He immediately resigned from the machinist's job and informed his mother, who saw no point in a university education, of his plans.25\nHigher education.\nIn his first semester, Pauling registered for two courses in chemistry, two in mathematics, mechanical drawing, introduction to mining and use of explosives, modern English prose, gymnastics and military drill.26 His roommate was childhood pal and lifelong best friend Lloyd Jeffress. He was active in campus life and founded the school's chapter of the Delta Upsilon fraternity. After his second year, he planned to take a job in Portland to help support his mother. The college offered him a position teaching quantitative analysis, a course he had just finished taking himself. He worked forty hours a week in the laboratory and classroom and earned a month (equivalent to in 2024), enabling him to continue his studies.29\nIn his last two years at school, Pauling became aware of the work of Gilbert N. Lewis and Irving Langmuir on the electronic structure of atoms and their bonding to form molecules.29 He decided to focus his research on how the physical and chemical properties of substances are related to the structure of the atoms of which they are composed, becoming one of the founders of the new science of quantum chemistry.\nEngineering professor Samuel Graf (1887\u20131966) selected Pauling to be his teaching assistant in a mechanics and materials course.29 During the winter of his senior year, Pauling taught a chemistry course for home economics majors. It was in one of these classes that Pauling met his future wife, Ava Helen Miller.3141\nIn 1922, Pauling graduated with a degree in chemical engineering. He went on to graduate school at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) in Pasadena, California, under the guidance of Roscoe Dickinson and Richard Tolman. His graduate research involved the use of X-ray diffraction to determine the structure of crystals. He published seven papers on the crystal structure of minerals while he was at Caltech. He received his PhD in physical chemistry and mathematical physics, summa cum laude, in 1925.\nCareer.\nIn 1926, Pauling was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship to travel to Europe, to study under German physicist Arnold Sommerfeld in Munich, Danish physicist Niels Bohr in Copenhagen and Austrian physicist Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger in Z\u00fcrich. All three were experts in the new field of quantum mechanics and other branches of physics. Pauling became interested in how quantum mechanics might be applied in his chosen field of interest, the electronic structure of atoms and molecules. In Z\u00fcrich, Pauling was also exposed to one of the first quantum mechanical analyses of bonding in the hydrogen molecule, done by Walter Heitler and Fritz London. Pauling devoted the two years of his European trip to this work and decided to make it the focus of his future research. He became one of the first scientists in the field of quantum chemistry and a pioneer in the application of quantum theory to the structure of molecules.\nIn 1927, Pauling took a new position as an assistant professor at Caltech in theoretical chemistry. He launched his faculty career with a very productive five years, continuing with his X-ray crystal studies and also performing quantum mechanical calculations on atoms and molecules. He published approximately fifty papers in those five years, and created the five rules now known as Pauling's rules. By 1929, he was promoted to associate professor, and by 1930, to full professor. In 1931, the American Chemical Society awarded Pauling the Langmuir Prize for the most significant work in pure science by a person 30 years of age or younger. The following year, Pauling published what he regarded as his most important paper, in which he first laid out the concept of hybridization of atomic orbitals and analyzed the tetravalency of the carbon atom.\nAt Caltech, Pauling struck up a close friendship with theoretical physicist Robert Oppenheimer at the University of California, Berkeley, who spent part of his research and teaching schedule as a visitor at Caltech each year. Pauling was also affiliated with Berkeley, serving as a visiting lecturer in physics and chemistry from 1929 to 1934. Oppenheimer even gave Pauling a stunning personal collection of minerals. The two men planned to mount a joint attack on the nature of the chemical bond: apparently Oppenheimer would supply the mathematics and Pauling would interpret the results. Their relationship soured when Oppenheimer tried to pursue Pauling's wife, Ava Helen. When Pauling was at work, Oppenheimer came to their home and blurted out an invitation to Ava Helen to join him on a tryst in Mexico. She flatly refused, and reported the incident to Pauling. He immediately cut off his relationship with Oppenheimer.152\nIn the summer of 1930, Pauling made another European trip, during which he learned about gas-phase electron diffraction from Herman Francis Mark. After returning, he built an electron diffraction instrument at Caltech with a student of his, Lawrence Olin Brockway, and used it to study the molecular structure of a large number of chemical substances.\nPauling introduced the concept of electronegativity in 1932. Using the various properties of molecules, such as the energy required to break bonds and the dipole moments of molecules, he established a scale and an associated numerical value for most of the elements\u2009\u2014\u2009the Pauling Electronegativity Scale\u2009\u2014\u2009which is useful in predicting the nature of bonds between atoms in molecules.\nIn 1936, Pauling was promoted to chairman of the division of chemistry and chemical engineering at Caltech, and to the position of director of the Gates and Crellin Laboratories of Chemistry. He would hold both positions until 1958. Pauling also spent a year in 1948 at the University of Oxford as George Eastman Visiting Professor and Fellow of Balliol.\nNature of the chemical bond.\nIn the late 1920s, Pauling began publishing papers on the nature of the chemical bond. Between 1937 and 1938, he took a position as George Fischer Baker Non-Resident Lecturer in Chemistry at Cornell University. While at Cornell, he delivered a series of nineteen lectures and completed the bulk of his famous textbook \"The Nature of the Chemical Bond\". It is based primarily on his work in this area that he received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1954 \"for his research into the nature of the chemical bond and its application to the elucidation of the structure of complex substances\". Pauling's book has been considered \"chemistry's most influential book of this century and its effective bible\". In the 30 years after its first edition was published in 1939, the book was cited more than 16,000 times. Even today, many modern scientific papers and articles in important journals cite this work, more than seventy years after the first publication.\nPart of Pauling's work on the nature of the chemical bond led to his introduction of the concept of orbital hybridization. While it is normal to think of the electrons in an atom as being described by orbitals of types such as \"s\" and \"p\", it turns out that in describing the bonding in molecules, it is better to construct functions that partake of some of the properties of each. Thus the one 2s and three 2p orbitals in a carbon atom can be (mathematically) 'mixed' or combined to make four equivalent orbitals (called sp3 hybrid orbitals), which would be the appropriate orbitals to describe carbon compounds such as methane, or the 2s orbital may be combined with two of the 2p orbitals to make three equivalent orbitals (called sp2 hybrid orbitals), with the remaining 2p orbital unhybridized, which would be the appropriate orbitals to describe certain unsaturated carbon compounds such as ethylene. Other hybridization schemes are also found in other types of molecules.\nAnother area which he explored was the relationship between ionic bonding, where electrons are transferred between atoms, and covalent bonding, where electrons are shared between atoms on an equal basis. Pauling showed that these were merely extremes, and that for most actual cases of bonding, the quantum-mechanical wave function for a polar molecule AB is a combination of wave functions for covalent and ionic molecules.66 Here Pauling's \"electronegativity\" concept is particularly useful; the electronegativity difference between a pair of atoms will be the surest predictor of the degree of ionicity of the bond.\nThe third of the topics that Pauling attacked under the overall heading of \"the nature of the chemical bond\" was the accounting of the structure of aromatic hydrocarbons, particularly the prototype, benzene. The best description of benzene had been made by the German chemist Friedrich Kekul\u00e9. He had treated it as a rapid interconversion between two structures, each with alternating single and double bonds, but with the double bonds of one structure in the locations where the single bonds were in the other. Pauling showed that a proper description based on quantum mechanics was an intermediate structure which was a blend of each. The structure was a superposition of structures rather than a rapid interconversion between them. The name \"resonance\" was later applied to this phenomenon. In a sense, this phenomenon resembles those of hybridization and also polar bonding, both described above, because all three phenomena involve combining more than one electronic structure to achieve an intermediate result.\nIonic crystal structures.\nIn 1929, Pauling published five rules which help to predict and explain crystal structures of ionic compounds. \nThese rules concern (1) the ratio of cation radius to anion radius, (2) the electrostatic bond strength, (3) the sharing of polyhedron corners, edges and faces, (4) crystals containing different cations, and (5) the rule of parsimony.\nBiological molecules.\nIn the mid-1930s, Pauling, strongly influenced by the biologically oriented funding priorities of the Rockefeller Foundation's Warren Weaver, decided to strike out into new areas of interest. Although Pauling's early interest had focused almost exclusively on inorganic molecular structures, he had occasionally thought about molecules of biological importance, in part because of Caltech's growing strength in biology. Pauling interacted with such great biologists as Thomas Hunt Morgan, Theodosius Dobzhanski, Calvin Bridges and Alfred Sturtevant. His early work in this area included studies of the structure of hemoglobin with his student Charles D. Coryell. He demonstrated that the hemoglobin molecule changes structure when it gains or loses an oxygen molecule. As a result of this observation, he decided to conduct a more thorough study of protein structure in general. He returned to his earlier use of X-ray diffraction analysis. But protein structures were far less amenable to this technique than the crystalline minerals of his former work. The best X-ray pictures of proteins in the 1930s had been made by the British crystallographer William Astbury, but when Pauling tried, in 1937, to account for Astbury's observations quantum mechanically, he could not.\nIt took eleven years for Pauling to explain the problem: his mathematical analysis was correct, but Astbury's pictures were taken in such a way that the protein molecules were tilted from their expected positions. Pauling had formulated a model for the structure of hemoglobin in which atoms were arranged in a helical pattern, and applied this idea to proteins in general.\nIn 1951, based on the structures of amino acids and peptides and the planar nature of the peptide bond, Pauling, Robert Corey and Herman Branson correctly proposed the alpha helix and beta sheet as the primary structural motifs in protein secondary structure. This work exemplified Pauling's ability to think unconventionally; central to the structure was the unorthodox assumption that one turn of the helix may well contain a non-integer number of amino acid residues; for the alpha helix it is 3.7 amino acid residues per turn.\nPauling then proposed that deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) was a triple helix; his model contained several basic mistakes, including a proposal of neutral phosphate groups, an idea that conflicted with the acidity of DNA. Sir Lawrence Bragg had been disappointed that Pauling had won the race to find the alpha helix structure of proteins. Bragg's team had made a fundamental error in making their models of protein by not recognizing the planar nature of the peptide bond. When it was learned at the Cavendish Laboratory that Pauling was working on molecular models of the structure of DNA, James Watson and Francis Crick were allowed to make a molecular model of DNA. They later benefited from unpublished data from Maurice Wilkins and Rosalind Franklin at King's College which showed evidence for a helix and planar base stacking along the helix axis. Early in 1953 Watson and Crick proposed a correct structure for the DNA double helix. Pauling later cited several reasons to explain how he had been misled about the structure of DNA, among them misleading density data and the lack of high quality X-ray diffraction photographs. Pauling described this situation as \"the biggest disappointment in his life\".\nDuring the time Pauling was researching the problem, Rosalind Franklin in England was creating the world's best images. They were key to Watson's and Crick's success. Pauling did not see them before devising his mistaken DNA structure, although his assistant Robert Corey did see at least some of them, while taking Pauling's place at a summer 1952 protein conference in England. Pauling had been prevented from attending because his passport was withheld by the State Department on suspicion that he had Communist sympathies. This led to the legend that Pauling missed the structure of DNA because of the politics of the day (this was at the start of the McCarthy period in the United States). Politics did not play a critical role. Not only did Corey see the images at the time, but Pauling himself regained his passport within a few weeks and toured English laboratories well before writing his DNA paper. He had ample opportunity to visit Franklin's lab and see her work, but chose not to. Despite these times, Pauling chose to move on from them and be thankful for the discoveries that he had already found.\nPauling also studied enzyme reactions and was among the first to point out that enzymes bring about reactions by stabilizing the transition state of the reaction, a view which is central to understanding their mechanism of action. He was also among the first scientists to postulate that the binding of antibodies to antigens would be due to a complementarity between their structures. Along the same lines, with the physicist turned biologist Max Delbr\u00fcck, he wrote an early paper arguing that DNA replication was likely to be due to complementarity, rather than similarity, as suggested by a few researchers. This was made clear in the model of the structure of DNA that Watson and Crick discovered.\nMolecular genetics.\nIn November 1949, Pauling, Harvey Itano, S. J. Singer and Ibert Wells published \"Sickle Cell Anemia, a Molecular Disease\" in the journal \"Science\". It was the first proof of a human disease being caused by an abnormal protein, and sickle cell anemia became the first disease understood at the molecular level. (It was not, however, the first demonstration that variant forms of hemoglobin could be distinguished by electrophoresis, which had been shown several years earlier by Maud Menten and collaborators). Using electrophoresis, they demonstrated that individuals with sickle cell disease have a modified form of hemoglobin in their red blood cells, and that individuals with sickle cell trait have both the normal and abnormal forms of hemoglobin. This was the first demonstration causally linking an abnormal protein to a disease, and also the first demonstration that Mendelian inheritance determines the specific physical properties of proteins, not simply their presence or absence \u2013 the dawn of molecular genetics.\nHis success with sickle cell anemia led Pauling to speculate that a number of other diseases, including mental illnesses such as schizophrenia, might result from flawed genetics. As chairman of the Division of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering and director of the Gates and Crellin Chemical Laboratories, he encouraged the hiring of researchers with a chemical-biomedical approach to mental illness, a direction not always popular with established Caltech chemists.\nIn 1951, Pauling gave a lecture entitled \"Molecular Medicine\". In the late 1950s, he studied the role of enzymes in brain function, believing that mental illness may be partly caused by enzyme dysfunction. In the 1960s, as part of his interest in the effects of nuclear weapons, he investigated the role of mutations in evolution, proposing with his student Emile Zuckerkandl, the molecular evolutionary clock, the idea that mutations in proteins and DNA accumulate at a constant rate over time .\nStructure of the atomic nucleus.\nOn September 16, 1952, Pauling opened a new research notebook with the words \"I have decided to attack the problem of the structure of nuclei.\" On October 15, 1965, Pauling published his Close-Packed Spheron Model of the atomic nucleus in two well respected journals, \"Science\" and the \"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences\". For nearly three decades, until his death in 1994, Pauling published numerous papers on his spheron cluster model.\nThe basic idea behind Pauling's spheron model is that a nucleus can be viewed as a set of \"clusters of nucleons\". The basic nucleon clusters include the deuteron [np], helion [pnp], and triton [npn]. Even\u2013even nuclei are described as being composed of clusters of alpha particles, as has often been done for light nuclei. Pauling attempted to derive the shell structure of nuclei from pure geometrical considerations related to Platonic solids rather than starting from an independent particle model as in the usual shell model. In an interview given in 1990 Pauling commented on his model:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Now recently, I have been trying to determine detailed structures of atomic nuclei by analyzing the ground state and excited state vibrational bends, as observed experimentally. From reading the physics literature, Physical Review Letters and other journals, I know that many physicists are interested in atomic nuclei, but none of them, so far as I have been able to discover, has been attacking the problem in the same way that I attack it. So I just move along at my own speed, making calculations ...\nActivism.\nWartime work.\nPauling had been practically apolitical until World War II. At the beginning of the Manhattan Project, Robert Oppenheimer invited him to be in charge of the Chemistry division of the project. He declined, not wanting to uproot his family.\nPauling did, however, work on research for the military. He was a principal investigator on 14 OSRD contracts. The National Defense Research Committee called a meeting on October 3, 1940, wanting an instrument that could reliably measure oxygen content in a mixture of gases, so that they could measure oxygen conditions in submarines and airplanes. In response Pauling designed the Pauling oxygen meter, which was developed and manufactured by Arnold O. Beckman, Inc. After the war, Beckman adapted the oxygen analyzers for use in incubators for premature babies.\nIn 1942, Pauling successfully submitted a proposal on \"The Chemical Treatment of Protein Solutions in the Attempt to Find a Substitute for Human Serum for Transfusions\". His project group, which included Joseph B. Koepfli and Dan H. Campbell, developed a possible replacement for human blood plasma in transfusions: polyoxy gelatin (Oxypolygelatin).\nOther wartime projects with more direct military applications included work on explosives, rocket propellants and the patent for an armor-piercing shell. In October 1948, Pauling, along with Lee A. DuBridge, William A. Fowler, Max Mason, and Bruce H. Sage, was awarded a Presidential Medal for Merit by President Harry S. Truman. The citation credits him for his \"imaginative mind\", \"brilliant success\", and \"exceptionally meritorious conduct in the performance of outstanding services\". In 1949, he served as president of the American Chemical Society.\nNuclear activism.\nThe aftermath of the Manhattan Project and his wife Ava's pacifism changed Pauling's life profoundly, and he became a peace activist.\nIn June 1945, a \"May-Johnson Bill\" began that would become the Atomic Energy Act of 1946 (signed August 1, 1946). In November 1945, Pauling spoke to the Independent Citizens Committee of the Arts, Sciences and Professions (ICCASP) on atomic weapons; shortly after, wife Ava and he accepted membership. On January 21, 1946, the group met to discuss academic freedom, during which Pauling said, \"There is, of course, always a threat to academic freedom \u2013 as there is to the other aspects of the freedom and rights of the individual, in the continued attacks which are made on this freedom, these rights, by the selfish, the overly ambitious, the misguided, the unscrupulous, who seek to oppress the great body of mankind in order that they themselves may profit \u2013 and we must always be on the alert against this threat, and must fight it with vigor when it becomes dangerous.\"\nIn 1946, he joined the Emergency Committee of Atomic Scientists, chaired by Albert Einstein. Its mission was to warn the public of the dangers associated with the development of nuclear weapons.\nHis political activism prompted the US State Department to deny him a passport in 1952, when he was invited to speak at a scientific conference in London. In a speech before the US Senate on June 6 of the same year, Senator Wayne Morse publicly denounced the action of the State Department, and urged the Passport Division to reverse its decision. Pauling and his wife Ava were then issued a \"limited passport\" to attend the conference. His full passport was restored in 1954, shortly before the ceremony in Stockholm where he received his first Nobel Prize.\nJoining Einstein, Bertrand Russell and eight other leading scientists and intellectuals, he signed the Russell-Einstein Manifesto issued July 9, 1955. He also supported the Mainau Declaration of July 15, 1955, signed by 52 Nobel Prize laureates.\nIn May 1957, working with Washington University in St. Louis professor Barry Commoner, Pauling began to circulate a petition among scientists to stop nuclear testing. On January 15, 1958, Pauling and his wife presented a petition to United Nations Secretary General Dag Hammarskj\u00f6ld calling for an end to the testing of nuclear weapons. It was signed by 11,021 scientists representing fifty countries.\nIn February 1958, Pauling participated in a publicly televised debate with the atomic physicist Edward Teller about the actual probability of fallout causing mutations. Later in 1958, Pauling published \"No more war!\", in which he not only called for an end to the testing of nuclear weapons but also an end to war itself. He proposed that a World Peace Research Organization be set up as part of the United Nations to \"attack the problem of preserving the peace\".\nPauling also supported the work of the St. Louis Citizen's Committee for Nuclear Information (CNI). This group, headed by Barry Commoner, Eric Reiss, M. W. Friedlander and John Fowler, organized a longitudinal study to measure radioactive strontium-90 in the baby teeth of children across North America. The \"Baby Tooth Survey\", published by Louise Reiss, demonstrated conclusively in 1961 that above-ground nuclear testing posed significant public health risks in the form of radioactive fallout spread primarily via milk from cows that had ingested contaminated grass. The Committee for Nuclear Information is frequently credited for its significant contribution to supporting the test ban, as is the ground-breaking research conducted by Reiss and the \"Baby Tooth Survey\".\nPublic pressure and the frightening results of the CNI research led to a moratorium on above-ground nuclear weapons testing, followed by the Partial Test Ban Treaty, signed in 1963 by John F. Kennedy and Nikita Khrushchev. On the day that the treaty went into force, October 10, 1963, the Nobel Prize Committee awarded Pauling the Nobel Peace Prize for 1962. (No prize had previously been awarded for that year.) They described him as \"Linus Carl Pauling, who ever since 1946 has campaigned ceaselessly, not only against nuclear weapons tests, not only against the spread of these armaments, not only against their very use, but against all warfare as a means of solving international conflicts.\" Pauling himself acknowledged his wife Ava's deep involvement in peace work, and regretted that she was not awarded the Nobel Peace Prize with him.\nPolitical criticism.\nMany of Pauling's critics, including scientists who appreciated the contributions that he had made in chemistry, disagreed with his political positions and saw him as a na\u00efve spokesman for Soviet communism. In 1960, he was ordered to appear before the Senate Internal Security Subcommittee, which termed him \"the number one scientific name in virtually every major activity of the Communist peace offensive in this country\". A headline in \"Life\" magazine characterized his 1962 Nobel Prize as \"A Weird Insult from Norway\".\nPauling was a frequent target of the \"National Review\" magazine. In an article entitled \"The Collaborators\" in the magazine's July 17, 1962, issue, Pauling was referred to not only as a collaborator, but as a \"fellow traveler\" of proponents of Soviet-style communism. In 1963, Pauling sued the magazine, its publisher William Rusher, and its editor William F. Buckley, Jr for $1 million. He lost both his libel suits and the 1968 appeal (unlike his earlier 1963 libel case against the Hearst Corporation), because in the meantime the landmark case \"New York Times Co. v. Sullivan\" had established the actual malice standard for libel lawsuits by public figures, requiring that not only falsehood but deliberate lying should be proved by the plaintiff in such cases.\nHis peace activism, his frequent travels, and his enthusiastic expansion into chemical-biomedical research all aroused opposition at Caltech. In 1958, the Caltech Board of Trustees demanded that Pauling step down as chairman of the Chemistry and Chemical Engineering Division. Although he had retained tenure as a full professor, Pauling chose to resign from Caltech after he received the Nobel peace prize money. He spent the next three years at the Center for the Study of Democratic Institutions (1963\u20131967). In 1967, he moved to the University of California at San Diego, but remained there only briefly, leaving in 1969 in part because of political tensions with the Reagan-era board of regents. From 1969 to 1974, he accepted a position as professor of chemistry at Stanford University.\nVietnam war activism.\nDuring the 1960s, President Lyndon Johnson's policy of increasing America's involvement in the Vietnam War caused an anti-war movement that the Paulings joined with enthusiasm. Pauling denounced the war as unnecessary and unconstitutional. He made speeches, signed protest letters and communicated personally with the North Vietnamese leader, Ho Chi Minh, and gave the lengthy written response to President Johnson. His efforts were ignored by the American government.\nPauling was awarded the International Lenin Peace Prize by the USSR in 1970. He continued his peace activism in the following years. He and his wife Ava helped to found the International League of Humanists in 1974. He was president of the scientific advisory board of the World Union for Protection of Life and also one of the signatories of the Dubrovnik\u2013Philadelphia statement of 1974/1976. Linus Carl Pauling was an honorary president and member of the International Academy of Science, Munich, until the end of his life.\nPauling was also a supporter of the Fair Play for Cuba Committee.\nGlobal activism.\nHe was one of the signatories of the agreement to convene a convention for drafting a world constitution. As a result, for the first time in human history, a World Constituent Assembly convened to draft and adopt a Constitution for the Federation of Earth.\nEugenics.\nPauling supported a limited form of eugenics by suggesting that human carriers of defective genes be given a compulsory visible mark \u2013 such as a forehead tattoo \u2013 to discourage potential mates with the same defect, in order to reduce the number of babies with diseases such as sickle cell anemia.\nMedical research and vitamin C advocacy.\nIn 1941, at age 40, Pauling was diagnosed with Bright's disease, a renal disease. Following the recommendations of Thomas Addis, who actively recruited Ava Helen Pauling as \"nutritionist, cook, and eventually as deputy 'doctor'\", Pauling believed he was able to control the disease with Addis's then-unusual low-protein salt-free diet and vitamin supplements. Thus Pauling's initial \u2013 and intensely personal \u2013 exposure to the idea of treating disease with vitamin supplements was positive.\nIn 1965, Pauling read \"Niacin Therapy in Psychiatry\" by Abram Hoffer and theorized vitamins might have important biochemical effects unrelated to their prevention of associated deficiency diseases. In 1968, Pauling published a brief paper in \"Science\" entitled \"Orthomolecular psychiatry\", giving a name to the popular but controversial megavitamin therapy movement of the 1970s, and advocating that \"orthomolecular therapy, the provision for the individual person of the optimum concentrations of important normal constituents of the brain, may be the preferred treatment for many mentally ill patients.\" Pauling coined the term \"orthomolecular\" to refer to the practice of varying the concentration of substances normally present in the body to prevent and treat disease. His ideas formed the basis of orthomolecular medicine, which is not generally practiced by conventional medical professionals and has been strongly criticized.\nIn 1973, with Arthur B. Robinson and another colleague, Pauling founded the Institute of Orthomolecular Medicine in Menlo Park, California, which was soon renamed the Linus Pauling Institute of Science and Medicine. Pauling directed research on vitamin C, but also continued his theoretical work in chemistry and physics until his death. In his last years, he became especially interested in the possible role of vitamin C in preventing atherosclerosis and published three case reports on the use of lysine and vitamin C to relieve angina pectoris. During the 1990s, Pauling put forward a comprehensive plan for the treatment of heart disease using lysine and vitamin C. In 1996, a website was created expounding Pauling's treatment which it referred to as Pauling Therapy. Proponents of Pauling Therapy believe that heart disease can be treated and even cured using only lysine and Vitamin C and without drugs or heart operations.\nPauling's work on vitamin C in his later years generated much controversy. He was first introduced to the concept of high-dose vitamin C by biochemist Irwin Stone in 1966. After becoming convinced of its worth, Pauling took 3\u00a0grams of vitamin C every day to prevent colds. Excited by his own perceived results, he researched the clinical literature and published \"Vitamin C and the Common Cold\" in 1970. He began a long clinical collaboration with the British cancer surgeon Ewan Cameron in 1971 on the use of intravenous and oral vitamin C as cancer therapy for terminal patients. Cameron and Pauling wrote many technical papers and a popular book, \"Cancer and Vitamin C\", that discussed their observations. Pauling made vitamin C popular with the public and eventually published two studies of a group of 100 allegedly terminal patients that claimed vitamin C increased survival by as much as four times compared to untreated patients.\nA re-evaluation of the claims in 1982 found that the patient groups were not actually comparable, with the vitamin C group being less sick on entry to the study, and judged to be \"terminal\" much earlier than the comparison group. Later clinical trials conducted by the Mayo Clinic led by oncologist Dr. Edward T. Creagan also concluded that high-dose (10,000\u00a0mg) vitamin C was no better than placebo at treating cancer and that there was no benefit to high-dose vitamin C. The failure of the clinical trials to demonstrate any benefit resulted in the conclusion that vitamin C was not effective in treating cancer; the medical establishment concluded that his claims that vitamin C could prevent colds or treat cancer were quackery. Pauling denounced the conclusions of these studies and handling of the final study as \"fraud and deliberate misrepresentation\", and criticized the studies for using oral, rather than intravenous vitamin C (which was the dosing method used for the first ten days of Pauling's original study). Pauling also criticised the Mayo Clinic studies because the controls were taking vitamin C during the trial, and because the duration of the treatment with vitamin C was short; Pauling advocated continued high-dose vitamin C for the rest of the cancer patient's life whereas the Mayo Clinic patients in the second trial were treated with vitamin C for a median of 2.5 months.\nUltimately the negative findings of the Mayo Clinic studies ended general interest in vitamin C as a treatment for cancer. Despite this, Pauling continued to promote vitamin C for treating cancer and the common cold, working with The Institutes for the Achievement of Human Potential to use vitamin C in the treatment of brain-injured children. He later collaborated with the Canadian physician Abram Hoffer on a micronutrient regime, including high-dose vitamin C, as adjunctive cancer therapy. A 2009 review also noted differences between the studies, such as the Mayo Clinic not using intravenous Vitamin C, and suggested further studies into the role of vitamin C when given intravenously. Results from most clinical trials suggest that modest vitamin C supplementation alone or with other nutrients offers no benefit in the prevention of cancer.\nPersonal life.\nPauling married Ava Helen Miller on June 17, 1923. The marriage lasted until her death in 1981. They had four children. Linus Carl Jr. (1925\u20132023) became a psychiatrist; Peter (1931\u20132003) a crystallographer at University College London; Edward Crellin (1937\u20131997) a biologist; and Linda Helen (born 1932) married noted Caltech geologist and glaciologist Barclay Kamb.\nPauling was raised as a member of the Lutheran Church, but later joined the Unitarian Universalist Church. Two years before his death, in a published dialogue with Buddhist philosopher Daisaku Ikeda, Pauling publicly declared his atheism.\nOn January 30, 1960, Pauling and his wife were using a cabin about south of Monterey, California, and he decided to go for a walk on a coastal trail. He got lost and tried to climb the rocky cliff, but reached a large overhanging rock about above the ocean. He decided it was safest to stay there, and meanwhile he was reported missing. He spent a sleepless night on the cliff before being found after almost 24 hours.\nDeath and legacy.\nPauling died of prostate cancer on August 19, 1994, at 19:20 at home in Big Sur, California. He was 93 years old. A grave marker for Pauling was placed in Oswego Pioneer Cemetery in Lake Oswego, Oregon by his sister Pauline, but Pauling's ashes, along with those of his wife, were not buried there until 2005.\nPauling's discoveries led to decisive contributions in a diverse array of areas including around 350 publications in the fields of quantum mechanics, inorganic chemistry, organic chemistry, protein structure, molecular biology, and medicine.\nHis work on chemical bonding marks him as one of the founders of modern quantum chemistry. \"The Nature of the Chemical Bond\" was the standard work for many years, and concepts like hybridization and electronegativity remain part of standard chemistry textbooks. While his valence bond approach fell short of accounting quantitatively for some of the characteristics of molecules, such as the color of organometallic complexes, and would later be eclipsed by the molecular orbital theory of Robert Mulliken, valence bond theory still competes, in its modern form, with molecular orbital theory and density functional theory (DFT) as a way of describing chemical phenomena. Pauling's work on crystal structure contributed significantly to the prediction and elucidation of the structures of complex minerals and compounds. His discovery of the alpha helix and beta sheet is a fundamental foundation for the study of protein structure.\nFrancis Crick acknowledged Pauling as the \"father of molecular biology\". His discovery of sickle cell anemia as a \"molecular disease\" opened the way toward examining genetically acquired mutations at a molecular level.\nPauling's 1951 publication with Robert B. Corey and H. R. Branson, \"The Structure of Proteins: Two Hydrogen-Bonded Helical Configurations of the Polypeptide Chain,\" was a key early finding in the then newly emerging field of molecular biology. This publication was honored by a Citation for Chemical Breakthrough Award from the Division of History of Chemistry of the American Chemical Society presented to the department of chemistry, Caltech, in 2017.\nCommemorations.\nOregon State University completed construction of the $77 million, Linus Pauling Science Center in the late 2000s, now housing the bulk of Oregon State's chemistry classrooms, labs, and instruments.\nOn March 6, 2008, the United States Postal Service released a 41 cent stamp honoring Pauling designed by artist Victor Stabin. His description reads: \"A remarkably versatile scientist, structural chemist Linus Pauling (1901\u20131994) won the 1954 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for determining the nature of the chemical bond linking atoms into molecules. His work in establishing the field of molecular biology; his studies of hemoglobin led to the classification of sickle cell anemia as a molecular disease.\" The other scientists on this sheet of stamps included Gerty Cori, biochemist, Edwin Hubble, astronomer, and John Bardeen, physicist.\nCalifornia Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger and First Lady Maria Shriver announced on May 28, 2008, that Pauling would be inducted into the California Hall of Fame, located at The California Museum for History, Women and the Arts. The induction ceremony took place December 15, 2008. Pauling's son Linus Jr. was asked to accept the honor in his place.\nBy proclamation of Gov. John Kitzhaber in the state of Oregon, February 28 has been named \"Linus Pauling Day\". The Linus Pauling Institute still exists, but moved in 1996 from Palo Alto, California, to Corvallis, Oregon, where it is part of the Linus Pauling Science Center at Oregon State University. The Valley Library Special Collections at Oregon State University contain the Ava Helen and Linus Pauling Papers, including digitized versions of Pauling's forty-six research notebooks.\nIn 1986, Caltech commemorated Linus Pauling with a symposium and lectureship. The Pauling Lecture series at Caltech began in 1989 with a lecture by Pauling himself. The Caltech Chemistry Department renamed room 22 of Gates Hall the Linus Pauling Lecture Hall, since Pauling spent so much time there.\nOther places named after Pauling include Pauling Street in Foothill Ranch, California; Linus Pauling Drive in Hercules, California; Linus and Ava Helen Pauling Hall at Soka University of America in Aliso Viejo, California; Linus Pauling Middle School in Corvallis, Oregon; and Pauling Field, a small airfield located in Condon, Oregon, where Pauling spent his youth. There is a psychedelic rock band in Houston, Texas, named The Linus Pauling Quartet.\nThe asteroid 4674 Pauling in the inner asteroid belt, discovered by Eleanor F. Helin, was named after Linus Pauling in 1991, on his 90th birthday.\nLinus Torvalds, developer of the Linux kernel, and Linus Sebastian, YouTuber known for the technology-oriented channel Linus Tech Tips, are named after Pauling.\nNobel laureate Peter Agre has said that Linus Pauling inspired him.\nIn 2010, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory named its distinguished postdoctoral program in his honor, as the Linus Pauling Distinguished Postdoctoral Fellowship Program.\nHonors and awards.\nPauling received numerous awards and honors during his career, including the following:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nPosthumously:\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nGeneral and cited references.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "37345", "revid": "3606755", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37345", "title": "Shrapnel shell", "text": "Anti-personnel artillery munitions\nShrapnel shells were anti-personnel artillery munitions that carried many individual bullets close to a target area and then ejected them to allow them to continue along the shell's trajectory and strike targets individually. They relied almost entirely on the shell's velocity for their lethality. \nThe munition has been obsolete since the end of World War I for anti-personnel use; high-explosive shells superseded it for that role. The functioning and principles behind shrapnel shells are fundamentally different from high-explosive shell fragmentation. \nShrapnel is named after Lieutenant-General Henry Shrapnel, a Royal Artillery officer, whose experiments, initially conducted on his own time and at his own expense, culminated in the design and development of a new type of artillery shell.\nUsage of the term \"shrapnel\" has changed over time to also refer to fragmentation of the casing of shells and bombs, which is its most common modern usage and strays from the original meaning.\nDevelopment.\nIn 1784, Lieutenant Shrapnel of the Royal Artillery began developing an anti-personnel weapon. At the time, artillery could use \"canister shot\" to defend themselves from infantry or cavalry attack, which involved loading a tin or canvas container filled with small iron or lead balls instead of the usual cannonball. When fired, the container burst open during passage through the bore or at the muzzle, giving the effect of an oversized shotgun shell. At ranges of up to 300 m canister shot was still highly lethal, though at this range the shots\u2019 density was much lower, making a hit on a human body less likely. At longer ranges, solid shot or the common shell\u2014a hollow cast-iron sphere filled with black powder\u2014was used, although with more of a concussive than a fragmentation effect, as the pieces of the shell were very large and sparse in number.\nShrapnel's innovation was to combine the multi-projectile shotgun effect of canister shot, with a time fuze to open the canister and disperse the shot it contained at some distance along the canister's trajectory from the gun. His shell was a hollow cast-iron sphere filled with a mixture of balls (\u201cshot\u201d) and powder, with a crude time fuze. If the fuze was set correctly then the shell would break open, either in front of or above the intended human objective, releasing its contents (of musket balls). The shrapnel balls would carry on with the \"remaining velocity\" of the shell. In addition to a denser pattern of musket balls, the retained velocity could be higher as well, since the shrapnel shell as a whole would likely have a higher ballistic coefficient than the individual musket balls (see external ballistics).\nThe explosive charge in the shell was to be just enough to break the casing rather than scatter the shot in all directions. As such his invention increased the effective range of canister shot from to about .\nHe called his device 'spherical case shot', but in time it came to be called after him; a nomenclature formalised in 1852 by the British Government.\nInitial designs suffered from the potentially-catastrophic problem that friction between the shot and black powder during the high acceleration down the gun bore could sometimes cause premature ignition of the powder. Various solutions were tried with limited, if any, success. However, in 1852, Colonel Boxer proposed using a diaphragm to separate the bullets from the bursting charge, which proved successful and was adopted the following year. As a buffer to prevent lead shot deforming, a resin was used as a packing material between the shot. A useful side effect of using the resin was that the combustion also gave a visual reference upon the shell bursting, as the resin shattered into a cloud of dust.\nBritish artillery adoption.\nIt took until 1803 for the British artillery to adopt (albeit with great enthusiasm) the shrapnel shell (as \"spherical case\"). Henry Shrapnel was promoted to major in the same year. The first recorded use of shrapnel by the British was in 1804 against the Dutch at Fort Nieuw-Amsterdam in Suriname. The Duke of Wellington's armies used it from 1808 in the Peninsular War and at the Battle of Waterloo, and he wrote admiringly of its effectiveness.\nThe design was improved by Captain E. M. Boxer of the Royal Arsenal around 1852 and crossed over when cylindrical shells for rifled guns were introduced. Lieutenant-Colonel Boxer adapted his design in 1864 to produce shrapnel shells for the new rifled muzzle-loader (RML) guns: the walls were of thick cast iron, but the gunpowder charge was now in the shell base with a tube running through the centre of the shell to convey the ignition flash from the time fuse in the nose to the gunpowder charge in the base. The powder charge both shattered the cast iron shell wall and liberated the bullets. The broken shell wall continued mainly forward but had little destructive effect. The system had major limitations: the thickness of the iron shell walls limited the available carrying capacity for bullets but provided little destructive capability, and the tube through the centre similarly reduced available space for bullets.\nIn the 1870s, William Armstrong provided a design with the bursting charge in the head and the shell wall made of steel and hence much thinner than previous cast-iron shrapnel shell walls. While the thinner shell wall and absence of a central tube allowed the shell to carry far more bullets, it had the disadvantage that the bursting charge separated the bullets from the shell casing by firing the case forward and at the same time slowing the bullets down as they were ejected through the base of the shell casing, rather than increasing their velocity. Britain adopted this solution for several smaller calibres (below 6-inch) but by World War I few if any such shells remained.\nThe final shrapnel shell design, adopted in the 1880s, bore little similarity to Henry Shrapnel's original design other than its spherical bullets and time fuse. It used a much thinner forged steel shell case with a timer fuse in the nose and a tube running through the centre to convey the ignition flash to a gunpowder bursting charge in the shell base. The use of steel allowed a thinner shell wall, allowing space for many more bullets. It also withstood the force of the powder charge without shattering so that the bullets were fired forward out of the shell case with increased velocity, much like a shotgun. The design came to be adopted by all countries and was in standard use when World War I began in 1914. During the 1880s, when both the old cast-iron and modern forged-steel shrapnel shell designs were in British service, British ordnance manuals referred to the older cast-iron design as \"Boxer shrapnel\", apparently to differentiate it from the modern steel design.\nThe modern thin-walled forged-steel design made feasible shrapnel shells for howitzers, which had a much lower velocity than field guns, by using a larger gunpowder charge to accelerate the bullets forward on bursting. The ideal shrapnel design would have had a timer fuse in the shell base to avoid the need for a central tube, but that was not technically feasible because of the need for manually adjust the fuse before firing and was in any case rejected from an early date by the British because of risk of premature ignition and irregular action.\nWorld War I era.\nTechnical considerations.\nThe size of shrapnel balls in World War I was based on two considerations. One was the premise that a projectile energy of about was required to disable an enemy soldier. A typical World War I field gun shell at its maximum possible range traveling at a velocity of 250 feet/second, plus the additional velocity from the shrapnel bursting charge (about 150 feet per second), would give individual shrapnel bullets a velocity of 400 feet per second and an energy of 60 foot-pounds (81 joules): this was the minimum energy of a single half-inch lead-antimony ball of approximately , or 41\u201342 balls = 1 pound. Hence this was a typical field gun shrapnel bullet size.\nThe maximum possible range, typically beyond , was beyond useful shrapnel combat ranges for normal field guns due to loss of accuracy and the fact that at extreme range the projectiles descended relatively steeply and hence the \"cone\" of bullets covered a relatively small area.\nAt a more typical combat range of , giving a fairly flat trajectory and hence a long \"beaten zone\" for the bullets, a typical 3-inch or 75-mm field gun shrapnel shell would have a velocity of approximately 900 feet/second. The bursting charge would add a possible 150 feet/second, giving a bullet velocity of 1,050 feet/second. This would give each bullet approximately 418 foot-pounds: seven times the assumed energy required to disable a man.\n formula_1\nFor larger guns which had lower velocities, correspondingly larger balls were used so that each individual ball carried enough energy to be lethal.\nMost engagements using guns in this size range used direct fire at enemy from to distant, at which ranges the residual shell velocity was correspondingly higher, as in the table \u2013 at least in the earlier stages of World War 1.\nThe other factor was the trajectory. The shrapnel bullets were typically lethal for about from normal field guns after bursting and over from heavy field guns. To make maximum use of these distances a flat-trajectory and hence high-velocity gun was required. The pattern in Europe was that the armies with higher-velocity guns tended to use heavier bullets because they could afford to have fewer bullets per shell.\nThe important points to note about shrapnel shells and bullets in their final stage of development in World War I are:\nA firsthand description of successful British deployment of shrapnel in a defensive barrage during the Third Battle of Ypres, 1917: ... the air is full of yellow spurts of smoke that burst about 30 feet up and shoot towards the earth \u2013 just ahead of each of these yellow puffs the earth rises in a lashed-up cloud \u2013 shrapnel \u2013 and how beautifully placed \u2013 long sweeps of it fly along that slope lashing up a good 200 yards of earth at each burst.\nTactical use.\nDuring the initial stages of World War I, shrapnel was widely used by all sides as an anti-personnel weapon. It was the only type of shell available for British field guns (13-pounder, 15 pounder and 18-pounder) until October 1914. Shrapnel was effective against troops in the open, particularly massed infantry (advancing or withdrawing). However, the onset of trench warfare from late 1914 led to most armies decreasing their use of shrapnel in favour of high-explosive. Britain continued to use a high percentage of shrapnel shells. New tactical roles included cutting barbed wire and providing \"creeping barrages\" to both screen its own attacking troops and suppressing the enemy defenders to prevent them from shooting at their attackers.\nIn a creeping barrage fire was 'lifted' from one 'line' to the next as the attackers advanced. These lines were typically apart and the lifts were typically 4 minutes apart. Lifting meant that time fuses settings had to be changed. The attackers tried to keep as close as possible (as little as 25 yards sometimes) to the bursting shrapnel so as to be on top of the enemy trenches when fire lifted beyond them, and before the enemy could get back to their parapets.\nAdvantages.\nWhile shrapnel made no impression on trenches and other earthworks, it remained the favoured weapon of the British (at least) to support their infantry assaults by suppressing the enemy infantry and preventing them from manning their trench parapets. This was called 'neutralization' and by the second half of 1915 had become the primary task of artillery supporting an attack. Shrapnel was less hazardous to the assaulting British infantry than high-explosives \u2013 as long as their own shrapnel burst above or ahead of them, attackers were safe from its effects, whereas high-explosive shells bursting short are potentially lethal within 100 yards or more in any direction. Shrapnel was also useful against counter-attacks, working parties and any other troops in the open.\nBritish Expeditionary Force \"GHQ Artillery Notes No. 5 Wire-cutting\" was issued in June 1916. It prescribed the use of shrapnel for wirecutting, with HE used to scatter the posts and wire when cut. However, there were constraints: the best ranges for 18-pdrs were 1,800\u20132,400 yards. Shorter ranges meant the flat trajectories might not clear the firers' own parapets, and fuses could not be set for less than 1,000 yards. The guns had to be overhauled by artificers and carefully calibrated. Furthermore, they needed good platforms with trail and wheels anchored with sandbags, and an observing officer had to monitor the effects on the wire continuously and make any necessary adjustments to range and fuse settings. These instructions were repeated in \"GHQ Artillery Notes No. 3 Artillery in Offensive Operations\", issued in February 1917 with added detail including the amount of ammunition required per yard of wire frontage. The use of shrapnel for wire-cutting was also highlighted in RA \"Training Memoranda No. 2 1939\".\nShrapnel provided a useful \"screening\" effect from the smoke of the black-powder bursting charges when the British used it in \"creeping barrages\".\nDisadvantages.\nOne of the key factors that contributed to the heavy casualties sustained by the British at the Battle of the Somme was the perceived belief that shrapnel would be effective at cutting the barbed wire entanglements in no man's land (although it has been suggested that the reason for the use of shrapnel as a wire-cutter at the Somme was because Britain lacked the capacity to manufacture enough HE shell). This perception was reinforced by the successful deployment of shrapnel shells against Germany's barbed wire entanglements in the 1915 Battle of Neuve Chapelle, but the Germans thickened their barbed wire strands after that battle. As a result, shrapnel was later only effective in killing enemy personnel; even if the conditions were correct, with the angle of descent being flat to maximise the number of bullets going through the entanglements, the probability of a shrapnel ball hitting a thin line of barbed wire and successfully cutting it was extremely low. The bullets also had limited destructive effect and were stopped by sandbags, so troops behind protection or in bunkers were generally safe. Additionally, steel helmets, including both the German Stahlhelm and the British Brodie helmet, could resist shrapnel bullets and protect the wearer from head injury:\n... suddenly, with a great clanging thud, I was hit on the forehead and knocked flying onto the floor of the trench... a shrapnel bullet had hit my helmet with great violence, without piercing it, but sufficiently hard to dent it. If I had, as had been usual up until a few days previously, been wearing a cap, then the Regiment would have had one more man killed.\nA shrapnel shell was more expensive than a high-explosive one and required higher-grade steel for the shell body. They were also harder to use correctly because getting the correct fuse running time was critical in order to burst the shell in the right place. This required considerable skill by the observation officer when engaging moving targets.\nAn added complication was that the actual fuse running time was affected by the meteorological conditions, with the variation in gun muzzle velocity being an added complication. However, the British used fuse indicators at each gun that determined the correct fuse running time (length) corrected for muzzle velocity.\nReplacement by high-explosive shell.\nWith the advent of relatively insensitive high explosives which could be used as the filling for shells, it was found that the casing of a properly designed high-explosive shell fragmented effectively . For example, the detonation of an average 105\u00a0mm shell produces several thousand high-velocity (1,000 to 1,500\u00a0m/s) fragments, a lethal (at very close range) blast overpressure and, if a surface or sub-surface burst, a useful cratering and anti-materiel effect \u2013 all in a munition much less complex than the later versions of the shrapnel shell. However, this fragmentation was often lost when shells penetrated soft ground, and because some fragments went in all directions it was a hazard to assaulting troops.\nVariations.\nOne item of note is the \"universal shell\", a type of field gun shell developed by Krupp of Germany in the early 1900s. This shell could function as either a shrapnel shell or high-explosive projectile. The shell had a modified fuse, and, instead of resin as the packing between the shrapnel balls, TNT was used. When a timed fuse was set the shell functioned as a shrapnel round, ejecting the balls and igniting (not detonating) the TNT, giving a visible puff of black smoke. When allowed to impact, the TNT filling would detonate, becoming a high-explosive shell with a very large amount of low-velocity fragmentation and a milder blast. Due to its complexity it was dropped in favour of a simple high-explosive shell.\nDuring World War I the UK also used shrapnel pattern shells to carry \"pots\" instead of \"bullets\". These were incendiary shells with seven pots using a thermite compound.\nWhen World War I began the United States also had what it referred to as the \"Ehrhardt high-explosive shrapnel\" in its inventory. It appears to be similar to the German design, with bullets embedded in TNT rather than resin, together with a quantity of explosive in the shell nose. Douglas Hamilton mentions this shell type in passing, as \"not as common as other types\" in his comprehensive treatises on manufacturing shrapnel and high-explosive shells of 1915 and 1916, but gives no manufacturing details. Nor does Ethan Viall in 1917. Hence the US appears to have ceased its manufacture early in the war, presumably based on the experience of other combatants.\nWorld War II era.\nA new British streamlined shrapnel shell, Mk 3D, had been developed for BL 60 pounder gun in the early 1930s, containing 760 bullets. There was some use of shrapnel by the British in the campaigns in East and North East Africa at the beginning of the war, where 18-pdr and 4.5-in (114\u00a0mm) howitzers were used. By World War II shrapnel shells, in the strict sense of the word, fell out of use, the last recorded use of shrapnel being 60 pdr shells fired in Burma in 1943. In 1945 the British conducted successful trials with shrapnel shells fused with VT. However, shrapnel was not developed as munitions for any new British artillery models after World War I.\nVietnam War era.\nAlthough not strictly shrapnel, a 1960s weapons project produced splintex shells for 90 and 106\u00a0mm recoilless rifles and 105\u00a0mm howitzers, where it was called a \"beehive\" round. Unlike the shrapnel shells\u2019 balls, the splintex shells contained flechettes. The result was the 105\u00a0mm M546 APERS-T (anti-personnel-tracer) round, first used in the Vietnam War in 1966. The shell consisted of approximately 8,000 one-half-gram flechettes arranged in five tiers, a time fuse, body-shearing detonators, a central flash tube, a smokeless propellant charge with a dye marker contained in the base and a tracer element. The shell functioned as follows: the time fuse fired, the flash traveled down the flash tube, the shearing detonators fired, and the forward body split into four pieces. The body and first four tiers were dispersed by the projectile's spin, the last tier and visual marker by the powder charge itself. The flechettes spread, mainly due to spin, from the point of burst in an ever-widening cone along the projectile's previous trajectory prior to bursting. The round was complex to make, but is a highly effective anti-personnel weapon \u2013 soldiers reported that after beehive rounds were fired during an overrun attack, many enemy dead had their hands nailed to the wooden stocks of their rifles, and these dead could be dragged to mass graves by the rifle. It is said that the name beehive was given to the munition type due to the noise of the flechettes moving through the air resembling that of a swarm of bees..\nModern era.\nThough shrapnel rounds are now rarely used, apart from the beehive munitions, there are other modern rounds, that use, or have used, the shrapnel principle. The DM 111 20\u00a0mm cannon round used for close-range air defense, the flechette-filled 40\u00a0mm HVCC (40 x 53\u00a0mm HV grenade), the 35\u00a0mm cannon (35 \u00d7 228\u00a0mm) AHEAD ammunition (152 \u00d7 3.3g tungsten cylinders), RWM Schweiz 30 \u00d7 173\u00a0mm air-bursting munition, five-inch (127 mm) shotgun projectile (KE-ET) and possibly more. Also, many modern armies have canister shot ammunition for tank and artillery guns, the XM1028 round for the 120\u00a0mm M256 tank gun being one example (approx 1150 tungsten balls at 1,400\u00a0m/s).\nSome anti-ballistic missiles (ABMs) use shrapnel-like warheads instead of the more common blast-fragmentation types. As with a blast-frag warhead, the use of this type of warhead does not require a direct body-on-body impact, so greatly reduces tracking and steering accuracy requirements. At a predetermined distance from the incoming re-entry vehicle (RV) the warhead releases, in the case of the ABM warhead by an explosive expulsion charge, an array of mainly rod-like sub-projectiles into the RV's flight path. Unlike a blast-frag warhead, the expulsion charge is only needed to release the sub-projectiles from the main warhead, not to accelerate them to high velocity. The velocity required to penetrate the RV's casing comes from the high terminal velocity of the warhead, similar to the shrapnel shell's principle. The reason for the use of this type of warhead and not a blast-frag is that the fragments produced by a blast-frag warhead cannot guarantee penetration of the RV's casing. By using rod-like sub-projectiles, a much greater thickness of material can be penetrated, greatly increasing the potential for disruption of the incoming RV.\nThe Starstreak missile uses a similar system, with three metal darts splitting from the missile prior to impact, although in the case of Starstreak these darts are guided and contain an explosive charge.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He was commissioned as a Royal Artillery lieutenant in 1779, serving first in Newfoundland. He returned to England in 1784, when he began to experiment with hollow cannonballs filled with lead shot that burst in mid-air.\nIn 1787 he was posted to Gibraltar where he began demonstrations of his anti-personnel weapon which impressed senior officers commanding the fortress. From Gibraltar, Shrapnel was sent to the West Indies in 1791. Shrapnel served in Flanders, where he was wounded in 1793. He was promoted to major on 1 November 1803 after eight years as a captain. \nIn 1803, the British Army adopted a similar but elongated explosive shell which immediately acquired the inventor's name. It has lent the term \"shrapnel\" to fragmentation from artillery shells and fragmentation in general ever since, long after it was replaced by high-explosive rounds. Until the end of World War I, the shells were still manufactured according to his original principles.\nAfter his invention's success in battle at Fort Nieuw-Amsterdam, Surinam, on 30 April 1804, Shrapnel was promoted to lieutenant colonel on 20 July 1804, less than nine months later.\nIn 1814, the British Government recognized Shrapnel's contribution by awarding him \u00a31,200 (\u00a3 in 2023) a year for life. Bureaucracy, however, prevented him from receiving the full benefit of this award. He was appointed to the office of colonel-commandant, Royal Artillery, on 6 March 1827. He rose to the rank of lieutenant general on 10 January 1837.\nShrapnel lived at Peartree House, near Peartree Green, Southampton, from about 1835 until his death.\nHis sister Rachel Shrapnel married the reverend Thomas Tregenna Biddulph.

The declaration was approved by Pope John Paul II and was published on August 6, 2000.\nIt is known for its elaboration of the Catholic dogma that the Catholic Church is the sole true Church founded by Jesus Christ.\nBackground.\nThe Catholic dogma (lit.\u2009'\"no salvation outside the Church\"') has sometimes been interpreted as denying salvation to non-Catholic Christians as well as non-Christians, though Catholic teaching has long stressed the possibility of salvation for persons invincibly ignorant (through no fault of their own) of the Catholic Church's necessity and thus not culpable for lacking communion with the Church.\nThe Second Vatican Council document \"Lumen gentium\" further affirmed that salvation could be available to people who had not even heard of Christ. However, all who gain salvation do so only by membership in the Catholic Church, whether that membership is ordinary (explicit) or by extraordinary means (implicit), such that any person who, despite \"knowing that the Catholic Church was made necessary by Christ, would refuse to enter or to remain in it, [cannot] be saved.\"\nRole of other religious communities.\nWhile affirming the teaching of \"Lumen gentium\" that the Catholic Church \"is the single Church of Christ\" and that \"[t]his Church, constituted and organized as a society in the present world, subsists in the Catholic Church\", offers further comments on what it means for the true Church to \"subsist in\" the Catholic Church. The document states that, \"[w]ith the expression , the Second Vatican Council sought to harmonize two doctrinal statements: on the one hand, that the Church of Christ, despite the divisions which exist among Christians, continues to exist fully only in the Catholic Church, and on the other hand, that 'outside of her structure, many elements can be found of sanctification and truth.'\"\nNon-Catholic Christians.\nThe document reserves the word \"Church\" for bodies that have preserved a \"valid episcopate and the genuine and integral substance of the Eucharistic mystery\". Such bodies, which include the Eastern Orthodox, Oriental Orthodox and the Old Catholic Churches, \"are true particular Churches\", and the document affirms that \"the Church of Christ is present and operative also in these Churches, even though they lack full communion with the Catholic Church, since they do not accept the Catholic doctrine of Primacy.\"\nThe document uses the term \"ecclesial community\" (from the Greek word , meaning \"church\") rather than \"Church\" for those Christian bodies not named in the preceding paragraph, most notably including all Protestants. The document states that, although such Christian communities \"are not Churches in the proper sense\", nevertheless \"those who are baptized in these communities are, by Baptism, incorporated in Christ and thus are in a certain communion, albeit imperfect, with the Church.\" It further states that such Christian communities, \"though we believe they suffer from defects, have by no means been deprived of significance and importance in the mystery of salvation. For the spirit of Christ has not refrained from using them as means of salvation.\"\nNon-Christian religions.\nThe document declares that, although the Catholic Church is intended by God to be \"the instrument for the salvation of all humanity,\" such beliefs do not \"lessen the sincere respect which the Church has for the religions of the world.\" It does, however, \"rule out, in a radical way [...] a religious relativism which leads to the belief that 'one religion is as good as another'\" which characterizes \"indifferentism\".\nThe document goes on to affirm the possibility that those who subscribe to non-Christian religions may eventually be saved while insisting that the means of such salvation must be by Christ through his Church, and not through the religion to which such a person subscribes: \"If it is true that the followers of other religions can receive divine grace, it is also certain that objectively speaking they are in a gravely deficient situation in comparison with those who, in the Church, have the fullness of the means of salvation.\" The document then immediately reminds Christians that their more direct enjoyment of the means of salvation comes \"not from their own merits, but from the grace of Christ. If they fail to respond in thought, word, and deed to that grace, not only shall they not be saved, but they shall be more severely judged.\"\nJohn Paul II.\nOn 1 October 2000, during one of his angelus, Pope John Paul II stated he had approved \"in a special way\". He added: \"This confession does not deny salvation to non-Christians, but points to its ultimate source in Christ, in whom man and God are united.\""}
{"id": "37349", "revid": "49088393", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37349", "title": "Liberation theology", "text": "Christian theological approach emphasizing the liberation of the oppressed\nLiberation theology is a Christian theological approach emphasizing the liberation of the oppressed. The term originated among Latin American Catholic theologians in the 1960s, and it has increasingly been used to describe similar approaches in other parts of the globe. It often engages in socio-economic analyses, and emphasizes social concern for those marginalized due to their social class, race, ethnicity, gender, etc.\nHistory.\nLiberation theologies were first being discussed in the Latin American context, especially within Catholicism in the 1960s after the Second Vatican Council. There, it became the political praxis of theologians such as Frei Betto, Gustavo Guti\u00e9rrez, Leonardo Boff, and Jesuits Juan Luis Segundo and Jon Sobrino, who popularized the phrase \"preferential option for the poor\".\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nIts roots can be traced to precursors like Catholic Action and the influence of the Second Vatican Council, which inspired new approaches to addressing systemic poverty and inequality in Latin America. While its theological framework centers on interpreting the Gospel through the lens of the oppressed, liberation theology also drew from broader socialist and anti-imperialist movements.\nLatin America also produced Protestant advocates of liberation theology, such as Rubem Alves, Jos\u00e9 M\u00edguez Bonino, and C. Ren\u00e9 Padilla, who in the 1970s called for integral mission, emphasizing evangelism and social responsibility.\nThe movement's theoretical foundations draws heavily from Marxist social analysis, particularly its critique of structural inequality and class oppression. While liberation theology does not adopt Marxism wholesale, its use of concepts like class struggle and the critique of global capitalism has led to significant controversy within the Church. Pope John Paul II and the Vatican\u2019s Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, led by Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger (later Pope Benedict XVI), criticized the movement for what they perceived as excessive politicization and alignment with communist ideologies.\nDespite this opposition, liberation theology influences political and social movements across Latin America. It was a driving force in the rise of grassroots ecclesial communities (), which mobilizes marginalized populations to advocate for land reform, labor rights, and democratic governance. These communities often serve as spaces for political consciousness-raising, blending religious practices with calls for systemic change. Liberation theology has been particularly influential in countries like El Salvador, where figures such as Archbishop \u00d3scar Romero became symbols of resistance against military regimes and human rights abuses.\nTheologies of liberation have also developed in other parts of the world such as black theology in the United States and South Africa, Palestinian liberation theology, Dalit theology in India, Minjung theology in South Korea, as well as liberation theology in Ireland.\nIn South Africa, the movement's principles resonated with Christian opposition to apartheid, providing a theological framework for resistance against racial oppression. The writings of theologians like Allan Boesak and Desmond Tutu show how liberation theology shaped anti-apartheid activism, emphasizing themes of reconciliation, justice, and the moral imperative to dismantle systemic racism. Similarly, liberationist ideas influenced Islamic thought, notably through figures like Ali Shari'ati in Iran, who adapted these principles to critique Western imperialism and promote economic justice within a Shi\u2019a framework.\nWhile its prominence has waned since its height in the 1970s and 1980s, liberation theology continues to influence contemporary theological and social movements. In the context of globalization, its critique of neoliberal policies and emphasis on solidarity among oppressed groups remain relevant. Pope Francis, the first Latin American pope, drew from liberationist ideas, particularly in his advocacy for economic justice and environmental stewardship, as seen in his encyclical \"Laudato Si\u2019\". This development signaled a renewed engagement with the movement\u2019s principles within the institutional Church.\nLiberation theology's legacy also includes its impact on academic discourse, where it has fostered interdisciplinary approaches to theology, sociology, and political science. Scholars have analyzed its role in decolonizing knowledge and creating counter-hegemonic narratives, particularly within the Global South. This scholarship highlights the movement\u2019s enduring relevance in addressing systemic inequality and advocating for transformative social change.\nDespite its contributions, liberation theology has faced significant criticism. Some within the Catholic Church questioned its alignment with Marxist ideologies, particularly its use of class analysis and its perceived politicization of theology. Others argue that its political activism blurred the boundaries between religion and politics, raising concerns about the church's role in revolutionary movements. Nevertheless, it has left a lasting legacy, inspiring contemporary movements that challenge systemic injustice. Its influence extends to ongoing critiques of global capitalism, solidarity efforts across the Global South, and theological reimaginings that prioritize the voices of the oppressed. As a movement that bridges faith and activism, liberation theology continues to serve as a powerful call to action for those seeking to reconcile spirituality with the fight for a more equitable world. Today, liberation theology\u2019s legacy endures in contemporary critiques of global capitalism and as a source of inspiration for ongoing struggles for justice.\nLatin America.\nLiberation theology developed within the Catholic Church in Latin America in the 1960s, as a reaction to the poverty and social injustice in the region, which CEPAL deemed the most unequal in the world. The term was coined in 1971 by the Peruvian priest Gustavo Guti\u00e9rrez, who wrote one of the movement's defining books, \"A Theology of Liberation\". Other exponents include Leonardo Boff of Brazil, and Jesuits Jon Sobrino of El Salvador and Juan Luis Segundo of Uruguay.\nLatin American liberation theology influenced parts of the evangelical movement and Catholic bishops in the United States. Its reliance on \"Marxism\" led in the mid-1980s to an admonition by the Vatican's Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith (CDF). While stating that \"in itself, the expression 'theology of liberation' is a thoroughly valid term\", the prefect Cardinal Ratzinger rejected certain forms of Latin American liberation theology for focusing on institutionalized or systemic sin and for identifying Catholic Church hierarchy in South America as members of the same privileged class that had long been oppressing Indigenous populations from the arrival of Pizarro onward.\nBlack communities.\nMore or less at the same time as the initial publications of Latin American liberation theology are also found voices of Black liberation theology and feminist liberation theology. Black theology refers to a theological perspective which originated in some black churches in the United States and later in other parts of the world, which contextualizes Christianity in an attempt to help those of African descent overcome oppression. It especially focuses on the injustices committed against African Americans and black South Africans during American segregation and apartheid, respectively.\nBlack theology seeks to liberate people of colour from multiple forms of political, social, economic, and religious subjugation and views Christian theology as a theology of liberation\u2014\"a rational study of the being of God in the world in light of the existential situation of an oppressed community, relating the forces of liberation to the essence of the Gospel, which is Jesus Christ,\" writes James Hal Cone, one of the original advocates of the perspective. Black theology mixes Christianity with questions of civil rights, particularly as raised by the Black Power movement and the Black Consciousness Movement.\nDalits.\nDalit theology is a branch of Christian theology that emerged among the Dalit castes in the Indian subcontinent in the 1980s. It shares a number of themes with Latin American liberation theology, which arose two decades earlier, including a self-identity as a people undergoing Exodus. Dalit theology sees hope in the \"Nazareth Manifesto\" of Luke 4, where Jesus speaks of preaching \"good news to the poor ... freedom for the prisoners and recovery of sight for the blind\" and of releasing \"the oppressed\".\nPalestinians.\nPalestinian liberation theology is an expression of political theology and a contextual theology that represents an attempt by a number of independently working Palestinian Christian theologians from various denominations\u2014mostly Protestant mainline churches\u2014to articulate the gospel message in such a way as to make that liberating gospel relevant to the perceived needs of their Indigenous flocks. As a rule, this articulation involves a theological underpinning of Palestinian resistance to Israel as well as Palestinian national aspirations, and an intense valorization of Palestinian ethnic and cultural identity as guarantors of a truer grasp of the gospel by virtue of the fact that they are inhabitants of the land of Jesus and the Bible. The principal figure in Palestinian liberation theology is the Anglican cleric Naim Ateek, founder of the Sabeel Ecumenical Liberation Theology Center in Jerusalem.\nNorthern Ireland.\nIn Ireland, liberation theology has been associated with the ideas and praxis of the Belfast Roman Catholic priest Des Wilson. Following the onset of the Northern Ireland Troubles, Wilson defended the right of communities systematically failed by the state, the churches and other institutions to create \"alternative education, alternative welfare, alternative theatre, broadcasting, theological and political discussion, public inquiries and much else\". More controversially, citing the example of Brazilian archbishop H\u00e9lder C\u00e2mara, he argued that this right extended to \"alternative police and alternative armies\".\nDuring the military dictatorship in Brazil, C\u00e2mara, who called on clergy to engage in the struggle for justice without fear of identification with the revolutionary left (\"When I give food to the poor, they call me a saint. When I ask why they are poor, they call me a communist\"), refused to condemn armed resistance. In a famous interview with Italian journalist Oriana Fallaci, he explained that while it was not his choice (\"not my road, not my way to apply the Gospels\"), he would never say \"to use weapons against an oppressor is immoral or anti-Christian\".\nWilson argued that a church, not itself pacifist (as a schoolchild he recalls being taught to revere General Franco as a soldier of Christ), needed to develop a new \"theology of pacifism\". Acknowledging the predicament of those who had \"a duty to protect others\u2014their families their homes\", this would need to do more than satisfy the needs of \"an oppressive government or of people seeking undemanding respectability\".\nDeaf people.\nDeaf liberation theology is a product of Deaf culture and a resistance to audism in mainstream hearing theological spaces. Deaf people often face exclusion in spaces of worship due to their status as a linguistic minority. The foundation of Deaf theology rests upon the \"Claggett Statement\".\nPeace movement.\nThe Christian peace movement has been associated with liberation theology in many ways. Participating theologians have been in all continents and countries, including countries with Christian minorities. A central theme has been peace as a way of redemption and liberation.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\nOn Pope John Paul II's relationship to Liberation theology"}

{"id": "37351", "revid": "20483999", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37351", "title": "CERN", "text": "European particle physics research centre\nThe European Organization for Nuclear Research, known as CERN (; ; ), is an intergovernmental organization that operates the largest particle physics laboratory in the world. Established in 1954, it is based in Meyrin, a western suburb of Geneva, on the France\u2013Switzerland border. It comprises 24 member states. Israel, admitted in 2013, is the only full member geographically out of Europe. CERN is an official United Nations General Assembly observer.\nThe acronym CERN is also used to refer to the laboratory; in 2024, it had scientific, technical, and administrative staff members, and hosted about users from institutions in more than 80 countries. In 2016, CERN generated 49 petabytes of data.\nCERN's main function is to provide the particle accelerators and other infrastructure needed for high-energy physics research \u2013 consequently, numerous experiments have been constructed at CERN through international collaborations. CERN is the site of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), the world's largest and highest-energy particle collider. The main site at Meyrin hosts a large computing facility, which is primarily used to store and analyze data from experiments, as well as simulate events. As researchers require remote access to these facilities, the lab has historically been a major wide area network hub. CERN is also the birthplace of the World Wide Web.\nHistory.\nThe convention establishing CERN was ratified on 29 September 1954 by 12 countries in Western Europe. The acronym CERN originally represented the French words for ('European Council for Nuclear Research'), which was a provisional council for building the laboratory, established by 12 European governments in 1952. During these early years, the council worked at the University of Copenhagen under the direction of Niels Bohr before moving to its present site near Geneva.\nThe acronym was retained for the new laboratory after the provisional council was dissolved, even though the name changed to the current ('European Organization for Nuclear Research') in 1954. According to Lew Kowarski, a former director of CERN, when the name was changed, the abbreviation could have become the awkward OERN, and Werner Heisenberg said that this could \"still be CERN even if the name is [not]\".\nCERN's first president was Sir Benjamin Lockspeiser. Edoardo Amaldi was the general secretary of CERN at its early stages when operations were still provisional, and the first Director-General (1954) was Felix Bloch.\nThe laboratory was originally devoted to the study of atomic nuclei, but was soon applied to higher-energy physics, concerned mainly with the study of interactions between subatomic particles. Therefore, the laboratory operated by CERN is commonly referred to as the European laboratory for particle physics (), which better describes the research being performed there.\nFounding members.\nAt the sixth session of the CERN Council in Paris from 29 June to 1 July 1953, the convention establishing the organization was signed, subject to ratification, by 12 states. The convention was gradually ratified by the 12 founding Member States: Belgium, Denmark, France, the Federal Republic of Germany, Greece, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and Yugoslavia.\nScientific achievements.\nSeveral major achievements in particle physics have occurred in experiments at CERN. They include:\nIn September 2011, CERN attracted media attention when the OPERA Collaboration reported the detection of possibly faster-than-light neutrinos. Further tests showed that the results were flawed due to an incorrectly connected GPS synchronization cable.\nThe 1984 Nobel Prize for Physics was awarded to Carlo Rubbia and Simon van der Meer for the developments that resulted in the discoveries of the W and Z bosons. The 1992 Nobel Prize for Physics was awarded to CERN staff researcher Georges Charpak \"for his invention and development of particle detectors, in particular the multiwire proportional chamber\". The 2013 Nobel Prize for Physics was awarded to Fran\u00e7ois Englert and Peter Higgs for the theoretical description of the Higgs mechanism in the year after the Higgs boson was found by CERN experiments.\nComputer science.\nCERN pioneered the introduction of TCP/IP for its intranet, beginning in 1984. This played an influential role in the adoption of the TCP/IP in Europe (see History of the Internet and Protocol Wars).\nIn 1989, the World Wide Web was invented at CERN by Tim Berners-Lee. Based on the concept of hypertext, the idea was designed to facilitate information sharing between researchers. This stemmed from Berners-Lee's earlier work at CERN on a database named ENQUIRE. A colleague, Robert Cailliau, became involved in 1990. \nIn 1995, Berners-Lee and Cailliau were jointly honoured by the Association for Computing Machinery for their contributions to the development of the World Wide Web. A copy of the first webpage, created by Berners-Lee, is still published on the World Wide Web Consortium's website as a historical document. The first website was activated in 1991. On 30 April 1993, CERN announced that the World Wide Web would be free to anyone. It became the dominant way through which most users interact with the Internet.\nMore recently, CERN has become a facility for the development of grid computing, hosting projects including the Enabling Grids for E-sciencE (EGEE) and LHC Computing Grid. It also hosts the CERN Internet Exchange Point (CIXP), one of the two main internet exchange points in Switzerland. As of 2022[ [update]], CERN employs ten times more engineers and technicians than research physicists.\nParticle accelerators.\nCurrent complex.\nCERN operates a network of seven accelerators and two decelerators, and some additional small accelerators. Each machine in the chain increases the energy of particle beams before delivering them to experiments or to the next more powerful accelerator. The decelerators naturally decrease the energy of particle beams before delivering them to experiments or further accelerators/decelerators. Before an experiment is able to use the network of accelerators, it must be approved by the various Scientific Committees of CERN. Currently (as of 2022) active machines are the LHC accelerator and:\nLarge Hadron Collider.\nMany activities at CERN currently involve operating the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and the experiments for it. The LHC represents a large-scale, worldwide scientific cooperation project.\nThe LHC tunnel is located 100 metres underground, in the region between Geneva International Airport and the nearby Jura mountains. The majority of its length is on the French side of the border. It uses the 27\u00a0km circumference circular tunnel previously occupied by the Large Electron\u2013Positron Collider (LEP), which was shut down in November 2000. CERN's existing PS/SPS accelerator complexes are used to pre-accelerate protons and lead ions which are then injected into the LHC.\nEight experiments (CMS, ATLAS, LHCb, MoEDAL, TOTEM, LHCf, FASER and ALICE) are located along the collider; each of them studies particle collisions from a different aspect, and with different technologies. Construction for these experiments required an extraordinary engineering effort. For example, a special crane was rented from Belgium to lower pieces of the CMS detector into its cavern, since each piece weighed nearly tons. The first of the approximately magnets necessary for construction was lowered down a special shaft at in March 2005.\nThe LHC has begun to generate vast quantities of data, which CERN streams to laboratories around the world for distributed processing, making use of a specialized grid infrastructure, the LHC Computing Grid. In April 2005, a trial successfully streamed 600\u00a0MB/s to seven different sites across the world.\nIn August 2008, the initial particle beams were injected into the LHC.&lt;ref name=\"NYT2008/07/29\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The first beam was circulated through the entire LHC on 10 September 2008, but the system failed 10 days later because of a faulty magnet connection, and it was stopped for repairs on 19 September 2008.\nThe LHC resumed operation on 20 November 2009 by successfully circulating two beams, each with an energy of 3.5\u00a0teraelectronvolts (TeV). The challenge for the engineers was then to line up the two beams so that they smashed into each other. This is like \"firing two needles across the Atlantic and getting them to hit each other\" according to Stephen Myers, director for accelerators and technology.\nOn 30 March 2010, the LHC successfully collided two proton beams with 3.5\u00a0TeV of energy per proton, resulting in a 7\u00a0TeV collision energy. This was enough to start the main research program, including the search for the Higgs boson. When the 7\u00a0TeV experimental period ended, the LHC increased to 8\u00a0TeV (4\u00a0TeV per proton) starting March 2012, and soon began particle collisions at that energy. In July 2012, CERN scientists announced the discovery of a new sub-atomic particle that was later confirmed to be the Higgs boson.\nIn March 2013, CERN announced that the measurements performed on the newly found particle allowed it to conclude that it was a Higgs boson. In early 2013, the LHC was deactivated for a two-year maintenance period, to strengthen the electrical connections between magnets inside the accelerator and for other upgrades.\nOn 5 April 2015, after two years of maintenance and consolidation, the LHC restarted for a second run. The first ramp to the record-breaking energy of 6.5\u00a0TeV was performed on 10 April 2015. In 2016, the design collision rate was exceeded for the first time. A second two-year period of shutdown begun at the end of 2018.\nAccelerators under construction.\nAs of October 2019, the construction is on-going to upgrade the LHC's luminosity in a project called High Luminosity LHC (HL\u2013LHC). This project should see the LHC accelerator upgraded by 2026 to an order of magnitude higher luminosity.\nAs part of the HL\u2013LHC upgrade project, also other CERN accelerators and their subsystems are receiving upgrades. Among other work, the LINAC 2 linear accelerator injector was decommissioned and replaced by a new injector accelerator, the LINAC4.\nPossible future accelerators.\nCERN, in collaboration with groups worldwide, is investigating two main concepts for future accelerators: A linear electron-positron collider with a new acceleration concept to increase the energy (CLIC) and a larger version of the LHC, a project currently named Future Circular Collider.\nSites.\nThe smaller accelerators are on the main Meyrin site, also known as the West Area, which was originally built in Switzerland alongside the French border, but has been extended to span the border since 1965. The French side is under Swiss jurisdiction and there is no obvious border within the site, apart from a line of marker stones.\nThe SPS and LEP/LHC tunnels are almost entirely outside the main site, and are mostly buried under French farmland and invisible from the surface. They have surface sites at points around them, either as the location of buildings associated with experiments or other facilities needed to operate the colliders such as cryogenic plants and access shafts. The experiments are located at the same underground level as the tunnels at these sites.\nThree of these experimental sites are in France, with ATLAS in Switzerland, and some of the ancillary cryogenic and access sites are in Switzerland. The largest of the experimental sites is the Pr\u00e9vessin site, also known as the North Area, which is the target station for non-collider experiments on the SPS accelerator. Other sites are the ones which were used for the UA1, UA2 and the LEP experiments. The latter are used by LHC experiments.\nOutside of the LEP and LHC experiments, most are officially named and numbered after the site where they were located. For example, NA32 was an experiment looking at the production of so-called \"charmed\" particles and located at the Pr\u00e9vessin (North Area) site. WA22 used the Big European Bubble Chamber (BEBC) at the Meyrin (West Area) site to examine neutrino interactions. The UA1 and UA2 experiments were considered to be in the Underground Area, i.e. situated underground at sites on the SPS accelerator.\nMost of the roads on the CERN Meyrin and Pr\u00e9vessin sites are named after famous physicists, such as Wolfgang Pauli, who pushed for CERN's creation. Other notable names are Richard Feynman, Albert Einstein, and Bohr.\nParticipation and funding.\nMember states and budget.\nSince its foundation by 12 members in 1954, CERN regularly accepted new members. All new members have remained in the organization continuously since their accession, except Spain and Yugoslavia. Spain first joined CERN in 1961, withdrew in 1969, and rejoined in 1983. Yugoslavia was a founding member of CERN but quit in 1961. Of the 24 members, Israel joined CERN as a full member in January 2014, becoming the first, and currently only, non-geographically European full member.\nThe budget contributions of member states are computed based on their GDP.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nEnlargement.\nAssociate Members, Candidates:\nInternational relations.\nThree countries have observer status:\nAlso observers are the following international organizations:\nNon-Member States (with dates of Co-operation Agreements) currently involved in CERN programmes are:\nCERN also has scientific contacts with the following other countries and regions:\nInternational research institutions, such as CERN, can aid in science diplomacy.\nAssociated institutions.\nA large number of institutes around the world are through current collaboration agreements and/or historical links. The list below contains organizations represented as observers to the CERN Council, organizations to which CERN is an observer and organizations based on the CERN model:\n.cern.\n.cern is a top-level domain for CERN. It was registered on 13 August 2014. On 20 October 2015, CERN moved its main website to https://home.cern.\nOpen science.\nThe Open Science movement focuses on making scientific research openly accessible and on creating knowledge through open tools and processes. Open access, open data, open source software and hardware, open licenses, digital preservation and reproducible research are primary components of open science and areas in which CERN has been working towards since its formation.\nCERN has developed policies and official documents that enable and promote open science, starting with CERN's founding convention in 1953 which indicated that all its results are to be published or made generally available. Since then, CERN published its open access policy in 2014, which ensures that all publications by CERN authors will be published with gold open access and most recently an open data policy that was endorsed by the four main LHC collaborations (ALICE, ATLAS, CMS and LHCb). \nThe open data policy complements the open access policy, addressing the public release of scientific data collected by LHC experiments after a suitable embargo period. Prior to this open data policy, guidelines for data preservation, access and reuse were implemented by each collaboration individually through their own policies which are updated when necessary. \nThe European Strategy for Particle Physics, a document mandated by the CERN Council that forms the cornerstone of Europe's decision-making for the future of particle physics, was last updated in 2020 and affirmed the organisation's role within the open science landscape by stating: \"The particle physics community should work with the relevant authorities to help shape the emerging consensus on open science to be adopted for publicly-funded research, and should then implement a policy of open science for the field\".\nBeyond the policy level, CERN has established a variety of services and tools to enable and guide open science at CERN, and in particle physics more generally. On the publishing side, CERN has initiated and operates a global cooperative project, the Sponsoring Consortium for Open Access Publishing in Particle Physics, SCOAP3, to convert scientific articles in high-energy physics to open access. In 2018, the SCOAP3 partnership represented 3,000+ libraries from 44 countries and 3 intergovernmental organizations who have worked collectively to convert research articles in high-energy physics across 11 leading journals in the discipline to open access.\nPublic-facing results can be served by various CERN-based services depending on their use case: the https://, Zenodo, the https://, INSPIRE and https:// are the core services used by the researchers and community at CERN, as well as the wider high-energy physics community for the publication of their documents, data, software, multimedia, etc. CERN's efforts towards preservation and reproducible research are best represented by a suite of services addressing the entire physics analysis lifecycle, such as data, software and computing environment. https:// helps researchers to preserve and document the various components of their physics analyses. https:// (Reusable Analyses) enables the instantiating of preserved research data analyses on the cloud.\nAll services are built using open source software and strive towards compliance with best effort principles, such as the FAIR principles, the FORCE11 guidelines and Plan S, while taking into account relevant activities carried out by the European Commission.\nPublic exhibitions.\nThe first public exhibition at CERN was the Microcosm museum which hosted an exhibition about particle physics and CERN history. It closed permanently on 18 September 2022, in preparation for the installation of the exhibitions in the newly built science center CERN Science Gateway.\nThe CERN Science Gateway, constructed by the Renzo Piano building workshop was opened in October 2023. It is home to the following spaces:\nThe Globe of Science and Innovation, which opened in late 2005, is open to the public. It is used four times a week for special exhibits.\nCERN also provides daily tours to certain facilities such as the Synchro-cyclotron (CERNs first particle accelerator) and the superconducting magnet workshop.\nArts at CERN.\nCERN launched its Cultural Policy for engaging with the arts in 2011. The initiative provided the essential framework and foundations for establishing https://, the arts programme of the Laboratory.\nSince 2012, Arts at CERN has fostered creative dialogue between art and physics through residencies, art commissions, exhibitions and events. Artists across all creative disciplines have been invited to CERN to experience how fundamental science pursues the big questions about our universe.\nEven before the arts programme officially started, several highly regarded artists visited the laboratory, drawn to physics and fundamental science. In 1972, James Lee Byars was the first artist to visit the laboratory and the only one, so far, to feature on the cover of the CERN Courier. Mariko Mori, Gianni Motti, Cerith Wyn Evans, John Berger and Anselm Kiefer are among the artists who came to CERN in the years that followed.\nThe programmes of Arts at CERN are structured according to their values and vision to create bridges between cultures. Each programme is designed and formed in collaboration with cultural institutions, other partner laboratories, countries, cities and artistic communities eager to connect with CERN's research, support their activities, and contribute to a global network of art and science.\nThey comprise research-led artistic residencies that take place on-site or remotely. More than 200 artists from 80 countries have participated in the residencies to expand their creative practices at the Laboratory, benefiting from the involvement of 400 physicists, engineers and CERN staff. Between 500 and 800 applications are received every year. The programmes comprise Collide, the international residency programme organised in partnership with a city; Connect, a programme of residencies to foster experimentation in art and science at CERN and in scientific organisations worldwide in collaboration with Pro Helvetia, and Guest Artists, a short stay for artists to stay to engage with CERN's research and community.\nSee also.\nInternational:\nGeneral:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "37352", "revid": "456858", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37352", "title": "Claymore mine", "text": "American directional anti-personnel mine\nThe Claymore mine is a directional anti-personnel mine developed for the United States Armed Forces, invented by Norman MacLeod. Unlike a conventional land mine, the Claymore may be command-detonated (fired by remote-control), and is directional, shooting a wide pattern of metal balls into a kill zone. The Claymore can also be activated by a booby-trap tripwire firing system for use in area denial operations.\nThe Claymore fires steel balls out to about within a 60\u00b0 arc in front of the device. It is used primarily in ambushes and as an anti-infiltration device against enemy infantry. It is also used against unarmored vehicles.\nMany countries have developed and used mines like the Claymore. Examples include models MON-50, MON-90, MON-100, and MON-200 introduced by the Soviet Union and used by its successor Russia, as well as MRUD (Serbia), MAPED F1 (France), and Mini MS-803 (South Africa).\nDescription.\nThe M18A1 Claymore mine has a horizontally convex gray-green plastic case (inert training versions are light blue or green with a light blue band). The shape was developed through experimentation to deliver the optimum distribution of fragments at range. The case has the words \"FRONT TOWARD ENEMY\" embossed on the front of the mine. A simple open sight on the top surface allows for aiming the mine. Two pairs of scissor legs attached to the bottom support the mine and allow it to be aimed vertically. On both sides of the sight are fuse wells set at 45\u00b0.\nInternally the mine contains a layer of C-4 explosive behind a matrix of about seven hundred steel balls set into an epoxy resin.\nWhen the M18A1 is detonated, the explosion drives the matrix forward, out of the mine at a velocity of , at the same time breaking it into individual fragments. The steel balls are projected in a 60\u00b0 fan-shaped pattern high and wide at a range of . The force of the explosion deforms the relatively soft steel balls into a shape similar to a .22 rimfire projectile. These fragments are moderately effective up to a range of , with a hit probability of around 10% on a prone man-sized target. The fragments can travel up to . The optimum effective range is , at which the optimal balance is achieved between lethality and area coverage, with a hit probability of 30% on a man-sized target.\nThe weapon and all its accessories are carried in an M7 bandolier (\"Claymore bag\"). The mine is detonated as the enemy personnel approaches the killing zone. Controlled detonation may be accomplished by use of either an electrical or non-electrical firing system. When mines are employed in the controlled role, they are treated as individual weapons and are reported in the unit fire plan. They are not reported as mines; however, the emplacing unit must ensure that the mines are removed, detonated, or turned over to a relieving unit. The M4 electric firing wire on a green plastic spool is provided in each bandolier. The M57 firing device (colloquially referred to as the \"clacker\") is included with each mine. An M40 circuit test set is packed in each case of six mines. When the mines are daisy-chained together, one firing device can detonate several mines.\nThe mine can be detonated by any mechanism that activates the blasting cap. There are field-expedient methods of detonating the mine by tripwire, or by a timer, but these are rarely used.\nDevelopment.\nThe development of the M18A1 mine dates back to work done during World War II. The Misnay\u2013Schardin effect was independently discovered during that war by J\u00f3zsef Misnay, a Hungarian, and Hubert Schardin, a German. When a sheet of explosive detonates in contact with a heavy backing surface (for example, a metal plate), the resulting blast is primarily directed away from the surface in a single direction. Schardin spent some time developing the discovery as a side-attack anti-tank weapon, but development was incomplete at the end of the war. Schardin also spent time researching a \"trench mine\" that used a directional fragmentation effect.\nNorman MacLeod and Calord Corporation.\nFollowing the massed Chinese attacks during the Korean War, Canada and the United States began to develop projects to counter them. Canada fielded a weapon called the \"Phoenix\" landmine, which used the Misnay\u2013Schardin effect to project a spray of steel cubes towards the enemy. The cubes were embedded in of Composition B explosive. It was too large to be a practical infantry weapon and was relatively ineffective, with a maximum effective range of only .\nAround 1952 Norman MacLeod, at his company the Calord Corporation, began working on a small directional mine for use by infantry. It is not clear if the United States Picatinny Arsenal took the concept from the Canadian weapon and asked Norman MacLeod to develop it, or if he developed the design independently and presented it to them. MacLeod designed a weapon called the T-48; broadly similar to the final M18A1, it lacked a number of the design details that made the M18A1 effective.\nThrough Picatinny, the United States Army accepted the weapon into service as the M18 Claymore and approximately 10,000 were produced. It was used in small numbers in Vietnam from around 1961. It was not until the improved M18A1 was developed that the Claymore became a widely used weapon.\nThe M18 was long and high, held in a plastic case with three folding spike legs on the bottom. An electrical blasting cap for triggering the mine was inserted through a small hole in the side. Internally the mine consisted of a layer of of C-3 explosive (the forerunner of C-4 explosive) in front of which was laid an array of steel cubes. In total the mine weighed about , and could be fitted with an optional peep sight for aiming. It lacked the later version's iconic \"FRONT TOWARD ENEMY\" marking. The mine was planted in the ground, using its three sharp legs, and aimed in the direction of enemy approach; at that point, it was fitted with an electrical blasting cap. The mine was triggered from a safe position, preferably to the side and rear. The mine was barely more than a prototype and was not considered a \"reliable casualty producer\"; like the Phoenix it had an effective range of only .\nMacLeod applied for a patent for the mine on 18 January 1956, and was granted it in February 1961. The patent was later the subject of a civil court case between MacLeod, the Army, and Aerojet, which further developed the Claymore design. MacLeod's case collapsed when photographs of the German Trenchmine prototype were produced as evidence of prior art.\nThroner, Kennedy, Bledsoe, and Kincheloe at Aerojet.\nIn 1954 Picatinny Arsenal issued a request for proposals (RFP) to improve the M18 as a more effective weapon. At Aerojet in the early 1950s, Guy C. Throner had independently come up with a design for a Claymore-like mine. He worked with Don Kennedy and the two men submitted a 30-page proposal in response to Picatinny's RFP. They were awarded a $375,000 development contract to improve the Claymore design. The Picatinny criteria for the weapon were as follows:\nThe requirement for kinetic energy was based on the fact that 58-foot-pounds is required to deliver a potentially lethal injury. Given the requirements of weight and fragment density, approximately 700 fragments were needed, with the ability to aim the mine with an accuracy of around at the center of the target zone. The team at Aerojet were given access to all previous research into directional mines, including the M18 and the Phoenix, as well as German research. Dr. John Bledsoe led the initial project.\nThe original M18 mine fell far short of Picatinny's requirements. One of the first improvements was to replace the steel cubes with hardened 52100 alloy ball bearings. These performed poorly for two reasons. Firstly, the hardened steel balls spalled into fragments when hit by the shock of the explosion; the fragments were neither aerodynamic enough nor large enough to perform effectively. Secondly, the blast \"leaked\" between the balls, reducing their velocity.\nA second problem was the curvature of the mine. This was determined experimentally by Bledsoe, through a large number of test firings. After Bledsoe left the project to work at the Rheem corporation, William Kincheloe, another engineer, came onto the Claymore project.\nKincheloe immediately suggested using softer steel \"gingle\" balls, which were used in the foundry process. They did not spall from the shock of the explosive, but deformed into a useful aerodynamic shape similar to a .22 rimfire projectile. Using a homemade chronograph, the engineers clocked the balls at . The second change was to use a poured plastic matrix to briefly contain the blast from the explosive, so that more of the blast energy was converted into projectile velocity. After a number of experiments, the engineers settled on Devcon-S steel-filled epoxy to hold the balls in place. With this change, the velocity improved to .\nTechnical challenges to overcome included developing a case to contain the corrosive C-3 explosive that would be durable enough to withstand months of field handling in wide temperature ranges. Using dyes to test various plastics for leaks, they found a suitable plastic called Durex 1661\u00bd, which could be easily molded into a case.\nBy the spring of 1956, Aerojet had a near-final design. It was awarded a pre-production contract for 1,000 M18A1 Claymores, designated T-48E1 during testing. The initial versions of the mine used two pairs of wire legs produced from number 9 (3\u00a0mm) wire. Later when production was ramped up, the design was changed to flat steel scissor, folding-type legs.\nEarly pre-production mines were triggered using a battery pack, which had been used with the M18. This was found to be undesirable for a number of reasons. Bill Kincheloe came up with the idea of using a \"Tiny Tim\" toggle generator, of the type used with a number of Navy rockets. Originally an aluminum box was used to hold the generator. Later a Philadelphia company, Molded Plastic Insulation Company, took over the manufacture of the firing device for the first large-scale production run producing a plastic device.\nThe sighting for the device was originally intended to be a cheap pentaprism device, which would allow the user to look down from above and see the sight picture. After locating a suitably low-cost device, the engineers found that fumes from either the C-3 explosive or the cement used to glue the sight to the top of the mine corroded the plastic mirrors, rendering them unusable. They adopted simple peep sights, which were later replaced by a knife blade sight.\nTesting concluded that the mine was effective out to approximately , being capable of hitting 10% of the attacking force. At , this increased to 30%. The development project completed, the Aerojet team sent the project back to Picatinny. The Arsenal bid it out to various component suppliers. In 1960 it was type standardized as the M18A1. It was first used in Vietnam in the spring or early summer 1966.\nMinor modifications were made to the mine during its service. A layer of tinfoil was added between the fragmentation matrix and the explosive. This slightly improves the fragment velocity, and protects the steel fragments from the corrosive explosive. A ferrite choke was added to prevent RF signals and lightning from triggering the mine.\nVariants.\nM68 inert training kit.\nThe M68 kit is designed to familiarize personnel with the placement and arming of a real M18 directional mine. It comes with all the components of a real Claymore kit packed in an M7 bandolier. The light blue or black plastic M33 inert anti-personnel mine is the training and practice version of the M18A1 Claymore. Some inert mines were green with a light blue band. It does not contain an explosive or pyrotechnic filler of any kind. It is packed in a Claymore bag with inert M10 simulated detonator cap wire, an M57 \"clacker\" firing control, and an M40 circuit test kit.\nMini-Multi-Purpose Infantry Munition.\nIn early 2015, the U.S. Army began testing a smaller version of the Claymore called the Mini-Multi-Purpose Infantry Munition (M-MPIMS). It weighs and has a effective range, similar to the full-size Claymore. At its optimized range of , the fragmentation zone is wide and high, with a minimum of five hits per square meter (0.5 per square foot). It has the surface space of an average smartphone and includes a Picatinny rail for camera, laser, or other attachments. The M-MPIMS is designed to be more controllable than the Claymore with less collateral damage, using an insensitive munitions explosive that is poured rather than packed for more uniform distribution results in more consistent blast pattern. Rear-safety distance has been decreased to and shelf life has been increased to 25\u00a0years.\nInternational directional fragmentation AP mines.\nPADMINE is an anti-personnel directional fragmentation mine produced by the United Kingdom, similar to the Claymore in cosmetic design with two swivelling legs, inserted into soft-ground. Its lethality out to arrives in the form of 650\u00a0steel balls and it is activated by remote control or trip wire.\nThe M18 directional fragmentation anti-personnel mine, developed by Cardoen of Chile, contains 626 grams of explosives, surrounded by 607\u00a0anti-personnel fragmentation units providing a 60\u00b0 arc of fire, with a lethal range.\nItaly produces the DAF M6 and DAF M7 directional fragmentation mines, weighing respectively, with trip wire or remote control detonation. Their appearance is similar to the Claymore mine.\nNational copies.\nA number of licensed and unlicensed copies of the mine have been produced.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

After adjacent lands had been conquered, its territory covered, at its greatest extent, roughly what is now Tuscany, western Umbria and northern Lazio, as well as what are now the Po Valley, Emilia-Romagna, south-eastern Lombardy, southern Veneto and western Campania.\nA large body of literature has flourished on the origins of the Etruscans, but the consensus among modern scholars is that the Etruscans were an indigenous population. The earliest evidence of a culture that is identifiably Etruscan dates from about 900\u00a0BC. This is the period of the Iron Age Villanovan culture, considered to be the earliest phase of Etruscan civilization, which itself developed from the previous late Bronze Age Proto-Villanovan culture in the same region, part of the central European Urnfield culture system. Etruscan civilization dominated Italy until it fell to the expanding Rome beginning in the late 4th\u00a0century\u00a0BC as a result of the Roman\u2013Etruscan Wars; Etruscans were granted Roman citizenship in 90\u00a0BC and in 27\u00a0BC the whole Etruscan territory was incorporated into the newly established Roman Empire.\nThe territorial extent of Etruscan civilization reached its maximum around 500\u00a0BC, shortly after the Roman Kingdom became the Roman Republic. Its culture flourished in three confederacies of cities: that of Etruria (Tuscany, Latium and Umbria), that of the Po Valley with the eastern Alps, and that of Campania. The league in northern Italy is mentioned in Livy. The reduction in Etruscan territory was gradual, but after 500\u00a0BC the political balance of power on the Italian peninsula shifted away from the Etruscans in favor of the rising Roman Republic.\nThe earliest known examples of Etruscan writing are inscriptions found in southern Etruria that date to around 700\u00a0BC. The Etruscans developed a system of writing derived from the Euboean alphabet, which was used in the Magna Graecia coastal areas in Southern Italy. The Etruscan language remains only partly understood, making modern understanding of their society and culture heavily dependent on much later and generally disapproving Roman and Greek sources. In the Etruscan political system authority resided in its individual small cities and probably in its prominent individual families. At the height of Etruscan power, elite Etruscan families grew very rich through trade with the Celts to the north and the Greeks to the south, and they filled their large family tombs with imported luxuries.\nLegend and history.\nEthnonym and etymology.\nAccording to Dionysius of Halicarnassus the Etruscans called themselves Rasenna (Greek \u1fec\u03b1\u03c3\u03ad\u03bd\u03bd\u03b1), a stem from the Etruscan Rasna (\ud800\udf1b\ud800\udf00\ud800\udf14\ud800\udf0d\ud800\udf00), the people. Evidence of inscriptions as Tular Rasnal (\ud800\udf15\ud800\udf16\ud800\udf0b\ud800\udf00\ud800\udf1b \ud800\udf1b\ud800\udf00\ud800\udf14\ud800\udf0d\ud800\udf00\ud800\udf0b), \"boundary of the people\", or Mechlum Rasnal (\ud800\udf0c\ud800\udf04\ud800\udf19\ud800\udf0b \ud800\udf1b\ud800\udf00\ud800\udf14\ud800\udf0d\ud800\udf00\ud800\udf0b). \"community of the people\", attest to its autonym usage. The Tyrsenian etymology, however, remains unknown.\nIn Attic Greek the Etruscans were known as Tyrrhenians (, \"Tyrrh\u0113noi\", earlier \"Tyrs\u0113noi\"), from which the Romans derived the names \"Tyrrh\u0113n\u012b\", \"Tyrrh\u0113nia\" (Etruria), and \"Mare Tyrrh\u0113num\" (Tyrrhenian Sea).\nThe ancient Romans referred to the Etruscans as the \"Tusc\u012b\" or \"Etrusc\u012b\" (singular \"Tuscus\"). Their Roman name is the origin of the terms Toscana, which refers to their heartland, and Etruria, which can refer to their wider region. The term \"Tusci\" is thought by linguists to have been the Umbrian word for Etruscan, based on an inscription on an ancient bronze tablet from a nearby region. The inscription contains the phrase \"turskum ... nomen\", literally 'the Tuscan name'. Based on a knowledge of Umbrian grammar, linguists can infer that the base form of the word turskum is *Tursci, which would, through metathesis and a word-initial epenthesis, be likely to lead to the form, \"E-trus-ci\".\nAs for the original meaning of the root, *Turs-, a widely cited hypothesis is that it, like the Latin \"turris\", means 'tower' and comes from the ancient Greek word for tower: , likely a loan into Greek. On this hypothesis, the Tusci were called the 'people who build towers\" or \"the tower builders\". This proposed etymology is made the more plausible because the Etruscans preferred to build their towns on high precipices reinforced by walls. Alternatively, Giuliano and Larissa Bonfante have speculated that Etruscan houses may have seemed like towers to the simple Latins. The proposed etymology has a long history, Dionysius of Halicarnassus having observed in the first century BC, \"[T]here is no reason that the Greeks should not have called [the Etruscans] by this name, both from their living in towers and from the name of one of their rulers.\" In his recent \"Etymological Dictionary of Greek\", Robert Beekes claims the Greek word is a \"loanword from a Mediterranean language\", a hypothesis that goes back to an article by Paul Kretschmer in \"Glotta\" from 1934.\nOrigins.\nAncient sources.\nLiterary and historical texts in the Etruscan language have not survived, and the language itself is only partially understood by modern scholars. This makes modern understanding of their society and culture heavily dependent on much later and generally disapproving Roman and Greek sources. These ancient writers differed in their theories about the origin of the Etruscan people. Some suggested they were Pelasgians who had migrated there from Greece. Others maintained that they were indigenous to central Italy.\nThe first Greek author to mention the Etruscans, whom the Ancient Greeks called Tyrrhenians, was the 8th-century BC poet Hesiod in his work the Theogony. He mentioned them as residing in central Italy alongside the Latins. The 7th-century BC \"Homeric Hymn\" to Dionysus referred to them as pirates. Unlike later Greek authors, these authors did not suggest that Etruscans had migrated to Italy from the east and did not associate them with the Pelasgians.\nIt was only in the 5th century BC, when the Etruscan civilization had been established for several centuries, that Greek writers started associating the name \"Tyrrhenians\" with the \"Pelasgians\", and even then some did so in a way that suggests they were meant only as generic, descriptive labels for \"non-Greek\" and \"indigenous ancestors of Greeks\" respectively. The 5th-century BC historians Herodotus, and Thucydides and the 1st-century BC historian Strabo, did seem to suggest that the Tyrrhenians were originally Pelasgians who migrated to Italy from Lydia by way of the Greek island of Lemnos. They all described Lemnos as having been settled by Pelasgians, whom Thucydides identified as \"belonging to the Tyrrhenians\" (). As Strabo and Herodotus told it, the migration to Lemnos was led by Tyrrhenus / Tyrsenos, the son of Atys (who was king of Lydia). Strabo added that the Pelasgians of Lemnos and Imbros then followed Tyrrhenus to the Italian Peninsula. According to the logographer Hellanicus of Lesbos, there was a Pelasgian migration from Thessaly in Greece to the Italian peninsula, as part of which the Pelasgians colonized the area he called Tyrrhenia, and they then came to be called Tyrrhenians.\nThere is some evidence suggesting a link between Lemnos and the Tyrrhenians. The Lemnos stele bears inscriptions in a language with strong structural resemblances to the language of the Etruscans. The discovery of these inscriptions in modern times has led to the suggestion of a \"Tyrrhenian language group\" consisting of Etruscan, Lemnian, and the Raetic spoken in the Alps.\n\u03a4his is aligned with the famous and largely debated testimony of Herodotus:\n\"\"The emigrants went down to Smyrna and built ships, and sailed away in search of a livelihood. After passing many nations, they came to the land of the Ombricans, where they built cities and have lived ever since. They no longer called themselves Lydians, but after the name of the king's son who led them out, they called themselves Tyrrhenians.\" (Herodotus)\"\nHerodotus also mentions the existence of a tribe called Tyrsenioi/Tyrrhenoi in Central Macedonia:\n\"\"based on the Pelasgians, who even now dwell above the Tyrrhenians in the city of Creston and who were once neighbors of those now called Dorians (for at that time the Pelasgians inhabited the land which is now called Thessaliotis).\" \nBy this Herodotus refers to Creston, a city/region in Macedonia, and that Pelasgians are residing above the Tyrsinoi that are known by Thucydides to dwell in the Athos Peninshula (Acte).\n\"In Acte were settled barbarian peoples, mixed and bilingual, and a small number of Chalcidians; but the greater part were Pelasgians Tyrrhenians from Lemnos and Athens, alongside Visaltai, Kristones, and Idones.\" (Thucydides)\nBut the 1st-century BC historian Dionysius of Halicarnassus, a Greek living in Rome, dismissed many of the ancient theories of other Greek historians and postulated that the Etruscans were indigenous people who had always lived in Etruria and were different from both the Pelasgians and the Lydians. Dionysius noted that the 5th-century historian Xanthus of Lydia, who was originally from Sardis and was regarded as an important source and authority for the history of Lydia, never suggested a Lydian origin of the Etruscans and never named Tyrrhenus as a ruler of the Lydians.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;For this reason, therefore, I am persuaded that the Pelasgians are a different people from the Tyrrhenians. And I do not believe, either, that the Tyrrhenians were a colony of the Lydians; for they do not use the same language as the latter, nor can it be alleged that, though they no longer speak a similar tongue, they still retain some other indications of their mother country. For they neither worship the same gods as the Lydians nor make use of similar laws or institutions, but in these very respects they differ more from the Lydians than from the Pelasgians. Indeed, those probably come nearest to the truth who declare that the nation migrated from nowhere else, but was native to the country, since it is found to be a very ancient nation and to agree with no other either in its language or in its manner of living.\nThe credibility of Dionysius of Halicarnassus is arguably bolstered by the fact that he was the first ancient writer to report the endonym of the Etruscans: Rasenna.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The Romans, however, give them other names: from the country they once inhabited, named Etruria, they call them Etruscans, and from their knowledge of the ceremonies relating to divine worship, in which they excel others, they now call them, rather inaccurately, Tusci, but formerly, with the same accuracy as the Greeks, they called them Thyrsco\u00ef [an earlier form of Tusci]. Their own name for themselves, however, is the same as that of one of their leaders, Rasenna.\nSimilarly, the 1st-century BC historian Livy, in his \"Ab Urbe Condita Libri\", said that the Rhaetians were Etruscans who had been driven into the mountains by the invading Gauls; and he asserted that the inhabitants of Raetia were of Etruscan origin.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The Alpine tribes have also, no doubt, the same origin (of the Etruscans), especially the Raetians; who have been rendered so savage by the very nature of the country as to retain nothing of their ancient character save the sound of their speech, and even that is corrupted.\nThe first-century historian Pliny the Elder also put the Etruscans in the context of the Rhaetian people to the north, and wrote in his \"Natural History\" (AD\u00a079):\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Adjoining these the (Alpine) Noricans are the Raeti and Vindelici. All are divided into a number of states. The Raeti are believed to be people of Tuscan race driven out by the Gauls, their leader was named Raetus.\nArcheological evidence and modern etruscology.\nThe question of the Etruscans' origins has long been a subject of interest and debate among historians. In modern times, all the evidence gathered by prehistoric and protohistoric archaeologists, anthropologists, and etruscologists points to an autochthonous origin of the Etruscans. There is no archaeological or linguistic evidence of a migration of the Lydians or Pelasgians into Etruria. Modern etruscologists and archeologists, such as Massimo Pallottino (1947), have shown that early historians' assumptions and assertions on the subject were groundless. In 2000, the etruscologist Dominique Briquel explained in detail why he believes that ancient Greek narratives on Etruscan origins should not even count as historical documents. He argues that the ancient story of the Etruscans' 'Lydian origins' was a deliberate, politically motivated fabrication, and that ancient Greeks inferred a connection between the Tyrrhenians and the Pelasgians solely on the basis of certain Greek and local traditions and because there had been trade between the Etruscans and Greeks. He noted that, even if these stories include historical facts suggesting contact, such contact is more plausibly traceable to cultural exchange than to migration.\nSeveral archaeologists specializing in Prehistory and Protohistory who have analyzed Bronze Age and Iron Age remains that were excavated in the territory of historical Etruria have pointed out that no evidence has been found, related either to material culture or to social practices, to support a migration theory. The most marked and radical change that has been archaeologically attested in the area is the adoption, starting in about the 12th century BC, of the funeral rite of incineration in terracotta urns, a Continental European practice derived from the Urnfield culture; nothing about it suggests an ethnic contribution from Asia Minor or the Near East.\nA 2012 survey of the previous 30 years' archaeological findings based on excavations of the major Etruscan cities showed a continuity of culture from the last phase of the Bronze Age (13th\u201311th century BC) to the Iron Age (10th\u20139th century BC). This is evidence that the Etruscan civilization, which emerged around 900 BC, was built by people whose ancestors had inhabited that region for at least the previous 200 years. Based on this cultural continuity, there is now a consensus among archeologists that Proto-Etruscan culture developed, during the last phase of the Bronze Age, from the indigenous Proto-Villanovan culture and that the subsequent Iron Age Villanovan culture is most accurately described as an early phase of the Etruscan civilization. It is possible that there were contacts between northern-central Italy and the Mycenaean world at the end of the Bronze Age, but contacts between the inhabitants of Etruria and inhabitants of Greece, Aegean Sea Islands, Asia Minor, and the Near East are attested only centuries later, when Etruscan civilization was already flourishing and Etruscan ethnogenesis was well established. The first of these attested contacts relate to the Greek colonies in Southern Italy and Phoenician-Punic colonies in Sardinia, and the consequent orientalizing period.\nOne of the most common mistakes for a long time, even among some scholars of the past, has been to associate the later Orientalizing period of Etruscan civilization with the question of its origins. Orientalization was an artistic and cultural phenomenon that spread among the Greeks themselves and throughout much of the central and western Mediterranean, not only in Etruria. The Etruscan orientalizing period was due, as has been amply demonstrated by archeologists, to contacts with the Greeks and the Eastern Mediterranean and not to mass migrations. The facial features (the profile, almond-shaped eyes, large nose) in the frescoes and sculptures and the depiction of reddish-brown men and light-skinned women, influenced by archaic Greek art, followed the artistic traditions from the Eastern Mediterranean that had spread even among the Greeks themselves, and to a lesser extent also to several other civilizations in the central and western Mediterranean up to the Iberian Peninsula. Actually, many of the tombs of the Late Orientalizing and Archaic periods, such as the Tomb of the Augurs, the Tomb of the Triclinium and the Tomb of the Leopards, as well as other tombs from the archaic period in the Monterozzi necropolis in Tarquinia, were painted by Greek painters or at least foreign artists. These images have, therefore, a very limited value for a realistic representation of the Etruscan population. It was only from the end of the 4th century BC that evidence of physiognomic portraits began to be found in Etruscan art and Etruscan portraiture became more realistic.\nArcheogenetics.\nThere have been numerous biological studies on the Etruscan origins, the oldest of which dates to the 1950s, when research was still based on blood tests of modern samples and DNA analysis (including the analysis of ancient samples) was not yet possible. Only very recently, with the development of archaeogenetics, have comprehensive studies containing the whole genome sequencing of Etruscan samples been published, including autosomal DNA and Y-DNA, autosomal DNA being the \"most valuable to understand what really happened in an individual's history\", as stated by geneticist David Reich, whereas previously studies were based only on mitochondrial DNA analysis, which contains less and limited information.\nAn archeogenetic study focusing on Etruscan origins was published in September 2021 in the journal \"Science Advances\" and analyzed the autosomal DNA and the uniparental markers (Y-DNA and mtDNA) of 48 Iron Age individuals from Tuscany and Lazio, spanning from 800 to 1 BC and concluded that the Etruscans were autochthonous (locally indigenous) and had a genetic profile similar to their Latin neighbors. In the Etruscan individuals the ancestral component Steppe was present in the same percentages as those found in the previously analyzed Iron Age Latins, and the Etruscan DNA bore no trace of recent admixture with Anatolia and the Eastern Mediterranean. Both Etruscans and Latins were firmly part of the European cluster, west of modern Italians. The Etruscans were a mixture of WHG, EEF and Steppe ancestry; 75% of the Etruscan male individuals were found to belong to haplogroup R1b (R1b M269), especially its clade R1b-P312 and its derivative R1b-L2, whose direct ancestor is R1b-U152, whilst the most common mitochondrial DNA haplogroup among the Etruscans was H.\nThe conclusions of the 2021 study are in line with a 2019 study published in the journal \"Science\" that analyzed the remains of eleven Iron Age individuals from the areas around Rome, of whom four were Etruscan, one buried in Veio Grotta Gramiccia from the Villanovan era (900-800 BC) and three buried in La Mattonara Necropolis near Civitavecchia from the Orientalizing period (700-600 BC). The study concluded that Etruscans (900\u2013600 BC) and the Latins (900\u2013500 BC) from Latium vetus were genetically similar, with genetic differences between the examined Etruscans and Latins found to be insignificant. The Etruscan individuals and contemporary Latins were distinguished from preceding populations of Italy by the presence of c.\u200930% steppe ancestry. Their DNA was a mixture of two-thirds Copper Age ancestry (EEF + WHG; Etruscans ~66\u201372%, Latins ~62\u201375%) and one-third Steppe-related ancestry (Etruscans ~27\u201333%, Latins ~24\u201337%). The only sample of Y-DNA belonged to haplogroup J-M12 (J2b-L283), found in an individual dated 700-600 BC, and carried the M314 derived allele also found in a Middle Bronze Age individual from Croatia (1631\u20131531 BC). The four samples of mtDNA extracted belonged to haplogroups U5a1, H, T2b32, K1a4.\nAmong the older studies, based only on mitochondrial DNA, a mtDNA study, published in 2018 in the American Journal of Physical Anthropology compared both ancient and modern samples from Tuscany, from Prehistory, the Etruscan age, Roman age, Renaissance and the present day and concluded that the Etruscans appear to be a local population, intermediate between the prehistoric and the other samples, placing them in the temporal network between the Eneolithic Age and the Roman Age.\nA couple of mitochondrial DNA studies published in 2013 in the journals PLOS One and American Journal of Physical Anthropology, based on Etruscan samples from Tuscany and Latium, concluded that the Etruscans were an indigenous population, showing that Etruscan mtDNA appears to be very close to a Neolithic population from Central Europe (Germany, Austria, Hungary) and to other Tuscan populations, strongly suggesting that the Etruscan civilization developed locally from the Villanovan culture, as supported by archaeological evidence and anthropological research, and that genetic links between Tuscany and western Anatolia date to at least 5,000 years ago during the Neolithic and the \"most likely separation time between Tuscany and Western Anatolia falls around 7,600 years ago\", at the time of the migrations of Early European Farmers (EEF) from Anatolia to Europe in the early Neolithic. The ancient Etruscan samples had mitochondrial DNA haplogroups (mtDNA) JT (subclades of J and T) and U5, with a minority of mtDNA H1b.\nAn mtDNA study published in 2004, based on about 28 samples of individuals who lived from 600 to 100 BC in Veneto, Etruria and Campania, found that the Etruscans had no significant heterogeneity and that all mitochondrial lineages observed among the Etruscan samples appear typically European or West Asian but only a few haplotypes were shared with modern populations. Allele sharing between the Etruscans and modern populations is highest among Germans (seven haplotypes in common), the Cornish from the South West of Britain (five haplotypes in common), the Turks (four haplotypes in common) and the Tuscans (two haplotypes in common). The modern populations with the shortest genetic distance from the ancient Etruscans, based solely on mtDNA and FST, were Tuscans followed by the Turks, other populations from the Mediterranean and the Cornish after. This study was much criticized by other geneticists, because \"data represent severely damaged or partly contaminated mtDNA sequences\" and \"any comparison with modern population data must be considered quite hazardous\", and by archaeologists, who argued that the study was not clear-cut and had not provided evidence that the Etruscans were an intrusive population to the European context.\nIn the collective volume \"Etruscology\" published in 2017, British archeologist Phil Perkins, echoing an article of his from 2009, provides an analysis of the state of DNA studies and writes, \"none of the DNA studies to date conclusively prove that [the] Etruscans were an intrusive population in Italy that originated in the Eastern Mediterranean or Anatolia\" and \"there are indications that the evidence of DNA can support the theory that Etruscan people are autochthonous in central Italy\".\nIn his 2021 book \"A Short History of Humanity\", German geneticist Johannes Krause, codirector of the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Jena, concludes that it is likely that the Etruscan language (as well as Basque, Paleo-Sardinian and Minoan) \"developed on the continent in the course of the Neolithic Revolution\".\nPeriodization of Etruscan civilization.\nThe Etruscan civilization begins with the early Iron Age Villanovan culture, regarded as the oldest phase, that occupied a large area of northern and central Italy during the Iron Age. The Etruscans themselves dated their nation's origin to a date corresponding to the 11th or 10th century BC. The Villanovan culture emerges with the phenomenon of regionalization from the late Bronze Age culture called \"Proto-Villanovan\", part of the central European Urnfield culture system. In the last Villanovan phase, called the recent phase (about 770\u2013730 BC), the Etruscans established relations of a certain consistency with the first Greek immigrants in southern Italy (in Pithecusa and then in Cuma), so much so as to initially absorb techniques and figurative models and soon more properly cultural models, with the introduction, for example, of writing, of a new way of banqueting, of a heroic funerary ideology, that is, a new aristocratic way of life, such as to profoundly change the physiognomy of Etruscan society. Thus, thanks to the growing number of contacts with the Greeks, the Etruscans entered what is called the orientalizing period. In this phase, there was a heavy influence in Greece, most of Italy and some areas of Spain, from the most advanced areas of the eastern Mediterranean and the ancient Near East. Also directly Phoenician, or otherwise Near Eastern, craftsmen, merchants and artists contributed to the spread in southern Europe of Near Eastern cultural and artistic motifs. The last three phases of Etruscan civilization are called, respectively, Archaic, Classical, and Hellenistic, which roughly correspond to the homonymous phases of the ancient Greek civilization.\nExpansion.\nEtruscan expansion was concentrated both in the north, beyond the Apennines, and in Campania, although the Etruscan presence in the Emilia-Romagna area, according to archaeologists, was not due to a recent expansion but to a much older presence. However, it is thought that the political structure of the Etruscan culture was similar to, albeit more aristocratic than, Magna Graecia in the south. The mining and commerce of metal, especially copper and iron, led to an enrichment of the Etruscans and to the expansion of their influence in the Italian peninsula and the western Mediterranean Sea. Here, their interests collided with those of the Greeks, especially in the sixth century\u00a0BC, when Phocaeans of Italy founded colonies along the coast of Sardinia, Spain and Corsica. This led the Etruscans to ally themselves with Carthage, whose interests also collided with the Greeks.\nAround 540\u00a0BC, the Battle of Alalia led to a new distribution of power in the western Mediterranean. Though the battle had no clear winner, Carthage managed to expand its sphere of influence at the Greeks' expense, and Etruria saw itself relegated to the northern Tyrrhenian Sea with full ownership of Corsica. From the first half of the 5th\u00a0century\u00a0BC, the new political situation meant the beginning of the Etruscan decline after losing their southern provinces. In 480\u00a0BC, Etruria's ally Carthage was defeated by a coalition of Magna Graecia cities led by Syracuse, Sicily. A few years later, in 474\u00a0BC, Syracuse's tyrant Hiero defeated the Etruscans at the Battle of Cumae. Etruria's influence over the cities of Latium and Campania weakened, and the area was taken over by Romans and Samnites.\nIn the 4th century\u00a0BC, Etruria saw a Gallic invasion end its influence over the Po Valley and the Adriatic coast. Meanwhile, Rome had started annexing Etruscan cities. This led to the loss of the northern Etruscan provinces. During the Roman\u2013Etruscan Wars, Etruria was conquered by Rome in the 3rd century\u00a0BC.\nEtruscan League.\nAccording to legend, there was a period between 600\u00a0BC and 500\u00a0BC in which an alliance formed among 12 Etruscan settlements, known today as the \"Etruscan League\", \"Etruscan Federation\", or \"Dodecapolis\" (). According to a legend, the Etruscan League of 12 cities was founded by Tarchon and his brother Tyrrhenus. Tarchon lent his name to the city of Tarchna, or Tarquinnii, as it was known by the Romans. Tyrrhenus gave his name to the Tyrrhenians, the alternative name for the Etruscans. Although there is no consensus on which cities were in the league, the following list may be close to the mark: Arretium, Caisra, Clevsin, Curtun, Perusna, Pupluna, Veii, Tarchna, Vetluna, Volterra, Velzna, and Velch. Some modern authors include Rusellae. The league was mostly an economic and religious league, or a loose confederation, similar to the Greek states. During the later imperial times, when Etruria was just one of many regions controlled by Rome, the number of cities in the league increased by three. This is noted on many gravestones from the 2nd century\u00a0BC onwards. According to Livy, the 12 city-states met once a year at the Fanum Voltumnae at Volsinii, where a leader was chosen to represent the league.\nThere were two other Etruscan leagues (\"Lega dei popoli\"): that of Campania, the main city of which was Capua, and the Po Valley city-states in northern Italy, which included Bologna, Spina and Adria.\nPossible founding of Rome.\nThose who subscribe to a Latin foundation of Rome followed by an Etruscan invasion typically speak of an Etruscan \"influence\" on Roman culture \u2013 that is, cultural objects which were adopted by Rome from neighboring Etruria. The prevailing view is that Rome was founded by Latins who later merged with Etruscans. In this interpretation, Etruscan cultural objects are considered influences rather than part of a heritage. Rome was probably a small settlement until the arrival of the Etruscans, who constructed the first elements of its urban infrastructure such as the drainage system.\nThe main criterion for deciding whether an object originated at Rome and traveled by influence to the Etruscans, or descended to the Romans from the Etruscans, is date. Many, if not most, of the Etruscan cities were older than Rome. If one finds that a given feature was there first, it cannot have originated at Rome. A second criterion is the opinion of the ancient sources. These would indicate that certain institutions and customs came directly from the Etruscans. Rome is located on the edge of what was Etruscan territory. When Etruscan settlements turned up south of the border, it was presumed that the Etruscans spread there after the foundation of Rome, but the settlements are now known to have preceded Rome.\nEtruscan settlements were frequently built on hills\u2014the steeper the better\u2014and surrounded by thick walls. According to Roman mythology, when Romulus and Remus founded Rome, they did so on the Palatine Hill according to Etruscan ritual; that is, they began with a \"pomerium\" or sacred ditch. Then they proceeded to the walls. Romulus was required to kill Remus when the latter jumped over the wall, breaking its magic spell (see also under Pons Sublicius). The name of Rome is attested in Etruscan in the form \"Ruma-\u03c7\" meaning 'Roman', a form that mirrors other attested ethnonyms in that language with the same suffix \"-\u03c7\": \"Velzna-\u03c7\" '(someone) from Volsinii' and \"Sveama-\u03c7\" '(someone) from Sovana'. But this in itself does not prove Etruscan origin conclusively. If Tiberius is from \"\u03b8efarie\", then Ruma would have been placed on the \"Thefar\" (Tiber) river. A heavily discussed topic among scholars is who was the founding population of Rome. In 390\u00a0BC, the city of Rome was attacked by the Gauls, and as a result may have lost many, though not all, of its earlier records.\nLater history relates that some Etruscans lived in the \"Vicus Tuscus\", the \"Etruscan quarter\", and that there was an Etruscan line of kings (albeit ones descended from a Greek, Demaratus of Corinth) that succeeded kings of Latin and Sabine origin. Etruscophile historians argue that this, together with evidence for institutions, religious elements and other cultural elements, proves that Rome was founded by Etruscans.\nUnder Romulus and Numa Pompilius, the people were said to have been divided into 30 curiae and three tribes. Few Etruscan words entered Latin, but the names of at least two of the tribes\u2014\"Ramnes\" and \"Luceres\"\u2014seem to be Etruscan. The last kings may have borne the Etruscan title \"lucumo\", while the regalia were traditionally considered of Etruscan origin\u2014the golden crown, the sceptre, the \"toga palmata\" (a special robe), the \"sella curulis\" (curule chair), and above all the primary symbol of state power: the \"fasces\". The latter was a bundle of whipping rods surrounding a double-bladed axe, carried by the king's lictors. An example of the fasces are the remains of bronze rods and the axe from a tomb in Etruscan Vetulonia. This allowed archaeologists to identify the depiction of a fasces on the grave stele of Avele Feluske, who is shown as a warrior wielding the fasces. The most telling Etruscan feature is the word \"populus\", which appears as an Etruscan deity, Fufluns.\nSociety.\nGovernment.\nThe historical Etruscans had achieved a state system of society, with remnants of the chiefdom and tribal forms. Rome was in a sense the first Italic state, but it began as an Etruscan one. It is believed that the Etruscan government style changed from total monarchy to oligarchic republic (as the Roman Republic) in the 6th\u00a0century\u00a0BC.\nThe government was viewed as being a central authority, ruling over all tribal and clan organizations. It retained the power of life and death; in fact, the gorgon, an ancient symbol of that power, appears as a motif in Etruscan decoration. The adherents to this state power were united by a common religion. Political unity in Etruscan society was the city-state, which was probably the referent of , \"district\". Etruscan texts name quite a number of magistrates, without much of a hint as to their function: The , the , the , the , the , and so on. The people were the \"mech\".\nImportance of Religion in the Government.\nGovernments in ancient Mediterranean societies were explicitly interwoven with the religious practices of the contemporary. The Etruscan King \"lucomo (plural: lucumones),\" was considered the supreme authority and under the Etruscans' theocratic governmental approach acted as the connection between god and people. The royal title was not just limited to hereditary succession but was also given due to elite lineage, divine sanction and also wealth. This prominence of divine sanction is reflective of the importance of religion in Etruscan governments and as such, all Etruscan kingship was also believed to be under divine approval and held the final word. Roman historian Titus Livius records the story of Lucomo which reflects how the divinity was revered and understood in the Etruscan era as captured by Roman historians. Lucomo was propelled by his wife Tanaquil to acquire power in Rome due to the inability to do so in Etruscan government,(Rome is considered the first Italic state) and on their journey an eagle replaced Lucomo's cap, which was interpreted as an omen from the divine of future kingship. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"That such bird had come from such a quarter of the heavens... it had lifted the ornament placed on the head of man, to restore it to the same, by direction of the gods.\"\nThis notion of combined political power and religious authorities held by the kingship is reinforced by Sybille Haynes, an expert on Etruscology, described the \"lucomo\" to also be \"chief priest.\" Tombs of the royals found also are engraved with divine symbols, which can be interpreted to understand that kings in this society acted as a connection between humans and the spiritual.\nWhile there was a transition from monarchy to oligarchic democracy, religion was deeply intertwined with Etruscan political and governmental identity, as Kings and magistrates worked to ensure peace with the gods by rituals and interpretation of the divine and their will through haruspicy and augury.\u00a0 The haruspices were a group of pristries who by analysis of the celestial signs and animal entrails could deduce the will of the gods. The creation of city-states as Tenney Frank argued took place due to economic and natural advantages, and also due to a need for common tribal meetings in ancient polities. It allowed for a dialogue of ideas to increase communication, and desires and was headed by the \"zilath mechl rasnal\", (\"magistrate of the Etruscan people\")\u00a0 who as modern scholars have argued functioned largely as a ceremonial leader, rather than a federal executive.\u00a0 Modelling a decentralised theocracy, this role further ties together the idea that Entruscan government was held through shared religious rituals and beliefs.\nIt is important to note that while Etruscan city states such as Tarquinia and Veii were established as politically autonomous, being centered around aristocratic rule and magistrates, international composition in these states were also considered progressive by scholars and historians. It is believed often due to the abundance of Greek and Roman sources over Etruscan ones that women were not allowed participation and enjoyment in public life, however\u00a0 their society was depicted to revere female gods, and women were allowed to participate in public life. This reverence for female duties can be deduced to understand how gender-diverse spirituality was also an important aspect of Etruscan society.\nPolitical religion also extended to the establishment of the twelve city-states, whose league was called \"duodecim populi Etruriae.\" This league held assemblies annually and selected their \"zilath mechl rasna\" at the \"Fanun Voltumnae,\" the shrine of Voltuma. Taking place at a sanctuary dedicated to the god Voltuma. These assemblies acted as both political conferences where military and peace talks could be held as well as religious festivals. Foreign policy, related to war, and alliances, were believed to be an outcome of the will of the gods, and discussions regarding this also took place at the yearly assemblies. Mario Torelli articulates that these asemblies served the purpose of ensuing a divine sanction for the actions decided by the collective.\u00a0 Lastly, the importance of religion in these meetings is further emblematic by the appointment of a dictator, who was chosen based on religious rituals to then hold the same supreme authority that the King had enjoyed in early Etruscan civilisation. As such, it can be envisioned that Etruscan policy and assemblies prioritised and revered divine legitimacy, the messages from gods were treated as the ultimate authority and the government's desire to maintain a strong positive relationship is prevalent.\nReligion was further embedded into the urban and geographical organisations of city states, and temples became an important political feature where decisions would be made as gods would act as a tool of legitimation. Mario Torelli, an Italian scholar of the culture of Etruscans, notes the intersection of temples as a place of worship and political power, creating the ultimate intersection cultivating an environment of sacred order.\nEtruscan's political and governmental strategies, with their influence of religion, also left a legacy in Roman religion and statecraft. Roman annexation of Etruscan city states occurred in the 4th and 3rd century BCE, and saw the adoption of many religious-political practices. Practices such as augury and haruspicy remained especially prevalent, as Etruscan haruspices were called upon by the Roman senate reflecting the importance of religion in nation building. As much of what is known about Etruscans comes from Greek and Roman authors, due to the few written records remaining from Etruscan's, it is studied through perspectives other than their own leading to a diminished understanding of religious importance in Etruscan governance.\nFamily.\nThe princely tombs were not of individuals. The inscription evidence shows that families were interred there over long periods, marking the growth of the aristocratic family as a fixed institution, parallel to the \"gens\" at Rome and perhaps even its model. The Etruscans could have used any model of the eastern Mediterranean. That the growth of this class is related to the new acquisition of wealth through trade is unquestioned. The wealthiest cities were located near the coast. At the center of the society was the married couple, \"tusurthir\". The Etruscans were a monogamous society that emphasized pairing.\nSimilarly, the behavior of some wealthy women is not uniquely Etruscan. The apparent promiscuous revelry has a spiritual explanation. Swaddling and Bonfante (among others) explain that depictions of the nude embrace, or symplegma, \"had the power to ward off evil\", as did baring the breast, which was adopted by western culture as an apotropaic device, appearing finally on the figureheads of sailing ships as a nude female upper torso. It is also possible that Greek and Roman attitudes to the Etruscans were based on a misunderstanding of the place of women within their society. In both Greece and the earliest Republican Rome, respectable women were confined to the house and mixed-sex socialising did not occur. Thus, the freedom of women within Etruscan society could have been misunderstood as implying their sexual availability. A number of Etruscan tombs carry funerary inscriptions in the form \"X son of (father) and (mother)\", indicating the importance of the mother's side of the family.\nMilitary.\nThe Etruscans, like the contemporary cultures of Ancient Greece and Ancient Rome, had a significant military tradition. In addition to marking the rank and power of certain individuals, warfare was a considerable economic advantage to Etruscan civilization. Like many ancient societies, the Etruscans conducted campaigns during summer months, raiding neighboring areas, attempting to gain territory and combating piracy as a means of acquiring valuable resources, such as land, prestige, goods, and slaves. It is likely that individuals taken in battle would be ransomed back to their families and clans at high cost. Prisoners could also potentially be sacrificed on tombs to honor fallen leaders of Etruscan society, not unlike the sacrifices made by Achilles for Patrocles.\nCities.\nThe range of Etruscan civilization is marked by its cities. They were entirely assimilated by Italic, Celtic, or Roman ethnic groups, but the names survive from inscriptions and their ruins are of aesthetic and historic interest in most of the cities of central Italy. Etruscan cities flourished over most of Italy during the Roman Iron Age, marking the farthest extent of Etruscan civilization. They were gradually assimilated first by Italics in the south, then by Celts in the north and finally in Etruria itself by the growing Roman Republic.\nThat many Roman cities were formerly Etruscan was well known to all the Roman authors. Some cities were founded by Etruscans in prehistoric times, and bore entirely Etruscan names. Others were colonized by Etruscans who Etruscanized the name, usually Italic.\nCulture.\nAgriculture.\nThe Etruscans were aware of the techniques of water accumulation and conservation in Egypt, Mesopotamia and Greece. They built canals and dams to irrigate the land, and drained and reclaimed swamps. The archaeological remains of this infrastructure are still evident in the maritime southwestern parts of Tuscany.\n\"Vite maritata\" is a viticulture technique exploiting companion planting named after the Maremma region of Italy which may be relevant to climate change. It was developed around the area by these early predecessors of the Romans who cultivated plant as nearly as possible in their natural habitat. The vines from which wine is made are a kind of liana that naturally intertwine with trees such as maples or willows.\nReligion.\nThe Etruscan system of belief was an immanent polytheism; that is, all visible phenomena were considered to be a manifestation of divine power and that power was subdivided into deities that acted continually on the world of man and could be dissuaded or persuaded in favor of human affairs. How to understand the will of deities, and how to behave, had been revealed to the Etruscans by two initiators, Tages, a childlike figure born from tilled land and immediately gifted with prescience, and Vegoia, a female figure. Their teachings were kept in a series of sacred books. Three layers of deities are evident in the extensive Etruscan art motifs. One appears to be divinities of an indigenous nature: Catha and Usil, the sun; \"Tivr\", the moon; Selvans, a civil god; Turan, the goddess of love; Laran, the god of war; Leinth, the goddess of death; Maris; Thalna; Turms; and the ever-popular Fufluns, whose name is related in some way to the city of Populonia and the populus Romanus, possibly, the god of the people.\nRuling over this pantheon of lesser deities were higher ones that seem to reflect the Indo-European system: Tin or Tinia, the sky, Uni his wife (Juno), and Cel, the earth goddess. In addition, some Greek and Roman gods were inspired by the Etruscan system: Aritimi (Artemis), Menrva (Minerva), Pacha (Dionysus). The Greek heroes taken from Homer also appear extensively in art motifs.\nArchitecture.\nRelatively little is known about the architecture of the ancient Etruscans. They adapted the native Italic styles with influence from the external appearance of Greek architecture. In turn, ancient Roman architecture began with Etruscan styles, and then accepted still further Greek influence. Roman temples show many of the same differences in form to Greek ones that Etruscan temples do, but like the Greeks, use stone, in which they closely copy Greek conventions. The houses of the wealthy were evidently often large and comfortable, but the burial chambers of tombs, often filled with grave-goods, are the nearest approach to them to survive. In the southern Etruscan area, tombs have large rock-cut chambers under a tumulus in large necropoleis, and these, together with some city walls, are the only Etruscan constructions to survive. Etruscan architecture is not generally considered as part of the body of Greco-Roman classical architecture.\nArt and music.\nEtruscan art was produced by the Etruscan civilization between the 9th and 2nd centuries BC. Particularly strong in this tradition were figurative sculpture in terracotta (particularly lifesize on sarcophagi or temples), wall-painting and metalworking (especially engraved bronze mirrors). Etruscan sculpture in cast bronze was famous and widely exported, but few large examples have survived (the material was too valuable, and recycled later). In contrast to terracotta and bronze, there was apparently little Etruscan sculpture in stone, despite the Etruscans controlling fine sources of marble, including Carrara marble, which seems not to have been exploited until the Romans. Most surviving Etruscan art comes from tombs, including all the fresco wall-paintings, a minority of which show scenes of feasting and some narrative mythological subjects.\nBucchero wares in black were the early and native styles of fine Etruscan pottery. There was also a tradition of elaborate Etruscan vase painting, which sprung from its Greek equivalent; the Etruscans were the main export market for Greek vases. Etruscan temples were heavily decorated with colorfully painted terracotta antefixes and other fittings, which survive in large numbers where the wooden superstructure has vanished. Etruscan art was strongly connected to religion; the afterlife was of major importance in Etruscan art.\nThe Etruscan musical instruments seen in frescoes and bas-reliefs are different types of pipes, such as the plagiaulos (the pipes of Pan or Syrinx), the alabaster pipe and the famous double pipes, accompanied on percussion instruments such as the tintinnabulum, tympanum and crotales, and later by stringed instruments like the lyre and kithara.\nLanguage.\nEtruscans left around 13,000 inscriptions which have been found so far, only a small minority of which are of significant length. Attested from 700 BC to AD 50, the relation of Etruscan to other languages has been a source of long-running speculation and study. The Etruscans are believed to have spoken a Pre-Indo-European and Paleo-European language, and the majority consensus is that Etruscan is related only to other members of what is called the Tyrsenian language family, which in itself is an isolate family, that is unrelated directly to other known language groups. Since Rix (1998), it is widely accepted that the Tyrsenian family groups Raetic and Lemnian are related to Etruscan.\nLiterature.\nEtruscan texts, written in a space of seven centuries, use a form of the Greek alphabet due to close contact between the Etruscans and the Greek colonies at Pithecusae and Cumae in the 8th\u00a0century\u00a0BC (until it was no longer used, at the beginning of the 1st\u00a0century\u00a0AD). Etruscan inscriptions disappeared from Chiusi, Perugia and Arezzo around this time. Only a few fragments survive, religious and especially funeral texts, most of which are late (from the 4th\u00a0century\u00a0BC). In addition to the original texts that have survived to this day, there are a large number of quotations and allusions from classical authors. In the 1st\u00a0century\u00a0BC, Diodorus Siculus wrote that literary culture was one of the great achievements of the Etruscans. Little is known of it and even what is known of their language is due to the repetition of the same few words in the many inscriptions found (by way of the modern epitaphs) contrasted in bilingual or trilingual texts with Latin and Punic. Out of the aforementioned genres, is just one such Volnio (Volnius) cited in classical sources mentioned. With a few exceptions, such as the Liber Linteus, the only written records in the Etruscan language that remain are inscriptions, mainly funerary. The language is written in the Etruscan alphabet, a script related to the early Euboean Greek alphabet. Many thousand inscriptions in Etruscan are known, mostly epitaphs, and a few very short texts have survived, which are mainly religious. Etruscan imaginative literature is evidenced only in references by later Roman authors, but it is evident from their visual art that the Greek myths were well known.\nWith the founding of Pithekussai on Ischia and Kyme (lat. Cumae) in Campania in the course of the Greek colonization, the Etruscans came under the influence of the Greek culture in the 8th century BC. The Etruscans adopted an alphabet from the western Greek colonists that came from their homeland, the Euboean Chalkis. This alphabet from Cumae is therefore also called Euboean or Chalcidian Alphabet. The oldest written records of the Etruscans date from around 700 BC.\nOne of the oldest Etruscan written documents is found on the from the hinterland of Vulci, which is now kept in the National Archaeological Museum of Florence. A western Greek model alphabet is engraved on the edge of this wax tablet made of ivory. In accordance with later Etruscan writing habits, the letters in this model alphabet were mirrored and arranged from right to left:\nThe script with these letters was first used in southern Etruria around 700 BC in the Etruscan Cisra (lat. Caere), today's Cerveteri. The science of writing quickly reached central and northern Etruria. From there, the alphabet spread from Volterra (Etr. Velathri) to Felsina, today's Bologna, and later from Chiusi (Etr. Clevsin) to the Po Valley. In southern Etruria, the writing spread from Tarquinia (Etr. Tarchna) and Veii (Etr. Veia) further south to Campania, which was controlled by the Etruscans at the time. In the following centuries the Etruscans consistently used the letters mentioned, so that the deciphering of the Etruscan inscriptions is not a problem. As in Greek, the characters were subject to regional and temporal changes. Overall, one can distinguish an archaic script from the 7th to 5th centuries from a more recent script from the 4th to 1st centuries BC, in which some characters were no longer used, including the X for a sh sound. In addition, in writing and language, the emphasis on the first syllable meant that internal vowels were not reproduced, e.g. \"Menrva\" instead of \"Menerva\". Accordingly, linguists also distinguish between Old and New Etruscan.\nAlongside the , around 70 objects with model alphabets have been preserved from the early period. The most famous of these are:\nAs all four artifacts date from the 7th century B.C. come from, the alphabets are always written clockwise. The last object has the special feature that, in addition to the letters of the alphabet, almost all consonants are shown in sequence in connection with the vowels I, A, U and E (Syllabary). This syllabic writing system was probably used to practice the written characters.\nThe most important Etruscan written monuments that contain a large number of words include:\nNo further Etruscan literature has survived and from the early 1st century AD, inscriptions with Etruscan characters have ceased to exist. All existing ancient Etruscan written documents are systematically collected in the Corpus Inscriptionum Etruscarum.\nIn the middle of the 7th century BC, the Romans adopted the Etruscan writing system and letters. In particular, they used the three different characters C, K and Q for a K sound. Z was also initially adopted into the Roman alphabet, although the affricate TS did not occur in the Latin language. Later, Z was replaced in the alphabet by the newly formed letter G, which was derived from C, and Z was finally placed at the end of the alphabet. The letters \u0398, \u03a6 and \u03a8 were omitted by the Romans because the corresponding aspirated sounds did not occur in their language.\nThe Etruscan alphabet spread across the northern and central parts of the Italian peninsula. It is assumed that the formation of the Oscan script, probably in the 6th century BC, was fundamentally influenced by Etruscan. The characters of the Umbrian, Faliscan and Venetic languages can also be traced back to Etruscan alphabets.\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

In the usual description of English, the basic form, with or without the particle \"to\", is the infinitive. In many languages, verbs are inflected (modified in form) to encode tense, aspect, mood, and voice. A verb may also agree with the person, gender or number of some of its arguments, such as its subject, or object. In English, three tenses exist: present, to indicate that an action is being carried out; past, to indicate that an action has been done; and future, to indicate that an action will be done, expressed with the auxiliary verb \"will\" or \"shall\".\nFor example:\nEvery language discovered so far makes some form of noun-verb distinction, possibly because of the graph-like nature of communicated meaning by humans, i.e. nouns being the \"entities\" and verbs being the \"links\" between them. The word \"verb\" comes from la \" verbum\"\u00a0'word or verb' and shares the same Indo-European root as \"word.\"\nAgreement.\nIn languages where the verb is inflected, it often agrees with its primary argument (the subject) in person, number or gender. With the exception of the verb \"to be\", English shows distinctive agreements only in the third person singular, present tense form of verbs, which are marked by adding \"-s\" ( \"walks) or \"-es\" (\"fishes). The rest of the persons are not distinguished in the verb (\"I walk\", \"you walk\", \"they walk\", etc.).\nLatin and the Romance languages inflect verbs for tense\u2013aspect\u2013mood (abbreviated 'TAM'), and they agree in person and number (but not in gender, as for example in Polish) with the subject. Japanese, like many languages with SOV word order, inflects verbs for tense-aspect-mood, as well as other categories such as negation, but shows absolutely no agreement with the subject\u2014it is a strictly dependent-marking language. On the other hand, Basque, Georgian, and some other languages, have \"polypersonal agreement\": the verb agrees with the subject, the direct object, and even the secondary object if present, a greater degree of head-marking than is found in most European languages.\nTypes.\nVerbs vary by type, and each type is determined by the kinds of words that accompany it and the relationship those words have with the verb itself. Classified by the number of their valency arguments, usually four basic types are distinguished: intransitives, transitives, ditransitives and double transitive verbs. Some verbs have special grammatical uses and hence complements, such as copular verbs (i.e., \"be\"); the verb \"do\" used for \"do\"-support in questioning and negation; and tense or aspect auxiliaries, e.g., \"be\", \"have\" or \"can\". In addition, verbs can be non-finite (not inflected for person, number, tense, etc.), such special forms as infinitives, participles or gerunds.\nIntransitive verbs.\nAn intransitive verb is one that does not have a direct object. Intransitive verbs may be followed by an adverb (a word that addresses how, where, when, and how often) or end a sentence. For example: \"The woman \"spoke\" softly.\" \"The athlete \"ran\" faster than the official.\" \"The boy \"wept\".\"\nTransitive verbs.\nA transitive verb is followed by a noun or noun phrase. These noun phrases are not called predicate nouns, but are instead called direct objects because they refer to the object that is being acted upon. For example: \"My friend \"read\" the newspaper.\" \"The teenager \"earned\" a speeding ticket.\"\nA way to identify a transitive verb is to invert the sentence, making it passive. For example: \"The newspaper \"was read\" by my friend.\" \"A speeding ticket \"was earned\" by the teenager.\"\nDitransitive verbs.\nDitransitive verbs (sometimes called Vg verbs after the verb \"give\") precede either two noun phrases or a noun phrase and then a prepositional phrase often led by \"to\" or \"for\". For example: \"The players \"gave\" their teammates high fives.\" \"The players \"gave\" high fives to their teammates.\"\nWhen two noun phrases follow a transitive verb, the first is an indirect object, that which is receiving something, and the second is a direct object, that being acted upon. Indirect objects can be noun phrases or prepositional phrases.\nDouble transitive verbs.\nDouble transitive verbs (sometimes called Vc verbs after the verb \"consider\") are followed by a noun phrase that serves as a direct object and then a second noun phrase, adjective, or infinitive phrase. The second element (noun phrase, adjective, or infinitive) is called a complement, which completes a clause that would not otherwise have the same meaning. For example: \"The young couple \"considers\" the neighbors wealthy people.\" \"Some students \"perceive\" adults quite inaccurately.\" \"Sarah \"deemed\" her project to be the hardest she has ever completed.\"\nCopular verbs.\nCopular verbs ( linking verbs) include \"be\", \"seem\", \"become\", \"appear\", \"look\", and \"remain\". For example: \"Her daughter \"was\" a writing tutor.\" \"The singers \"were\" very nervous.\" \"His mother \"looked\" worried.\" \"Josh \"remained\" a reliable friend.\" These verbs precede nouns or adjectives in a sentence, which become predicate nouns and predicate adjectives. Copulae are thought to 'link' the predicate adjective or noun to the subject. They can also be followed by an adverb of place, which is sometimes referred to as a predicate adverb. For example: \"My house \"is\" down the street.\"\nThe main copular verb \"be\" is manifested in eight forms \"be\", \"is\", \"am\", \"are\", \"was\", \"were\", \"been\", and \"being\" in English.\nValency.\nThe number of arguments that a verb takes is called its \"valency\" or \"valence\". Verbs can be classified according to their valency:\nImpersonal and objective verbs.\nWeather verbs often appear to be impersonal (subjectless, or avalent) in null-subject languages like Spanish, where the verb \"llueve\" means \"It rains\". In English, French and German, they require a dummy pronoun and therefore formally have a valency of 1. As verbs in Spanish incorporate the subject as a TAM suffix, Spanish is not actually a null-subject language, unlike Mandarin (see above). Such verbs in Spanish also have a valency of 1.\nIntransitive and transitive verbs are the most common, but the impersonal and objective verbs are somewhat different from the norm. In the objective, the verb takes an object but no subject; the nonreferent subject in some uses may be marked in the verb by an incorporated dummy pronoun similar to that used with the English weather verbs. Impersonal verbs in null subject languages take neither subject nor object, as is true of other verbs, but again the verb may show incorporated dummy pronouns despite the lack of subject and object phrases.\nValency marking.\nVerbs are often flexible with regard to valency. In non-valency marking languages such as English, a transitive verb can often drop its object and become intransitive; or an intransitive verb can take an object and become transitive. For example, in English the verb \"move\" has no grammatical object in \"he moves\" (though in this case, the subject itself may be an implied object, also expressible explicitly as in \"he moves himself\"); but in \"he moves the car\", the subject and object are distinct and the verb has a different valency. Some verbs in English have historically derived forms that show change of valency in some causative verbs, such as \"fall-fell-fallen\":\"fell-felled-felled\"; \"rise-rose-risen\":\"raise-raised-raised\"; \"cost-cost-cost\":\"cost-costed-costed\".\nIn valency marking languages, valency change is shown by inflecting the verb in order to change the valency. In Kalaw Lagaw Ya of Australia, for example, verbs distinguish valency by argument agreement suffixes and TAM endings:\n\"Verb structure:\" manga-i-[number]-TAM \"arrive+active+singular/dual/plural+TAM\"\n\"Verb structure:\" manga-\u00d8-[number]-TAM \"arrive+attainative+singular/dual/plural+TAM\"\nThe verb stem manga- 'to take/come/arrive' at the destination takes the active suffix -i (&gt; mangai-) in the intransitive form, and as a transitive verb the stem is not suffixed. The TAM ending -nu is the general today past attainative perfective, found with all numbers in the perfective except the singular active, where -ma is found.\nTense, aspect, and modality.\nDepending on the language, verbs may express \"grammatical tense\", \"aspect\", or \"modality\". \nTense.\nGrammatical tense is the use of auxiliary verbs or inflections to convey whether the action or state is before, simultaneous with, or after some reference point. The reference point could be the time of utterance, in which case the verb expresses absolute tense, or it could be a past, present, or future time of reference previously established in the sentence, in which case the verb expresses relative tense.\nAspect.\nAspect expresses how the action or state occurs through time. Important examples include:\nAspect can either be lexical, in which case the aspect is embedded in the verb's meaning (as in \"the sun shines\", where \"shines\" is lexically stative), or it can be grammatically expressed, as in \"I am running.\"\nMood and modality.\nModality expresses the speaker's attitude toward the action or state given by the verb, especially with regard to degree of necessity, obligation, or permission (\"You must go\", \"You should go\", \"You may go\"), determination or willingness (\"I will do this no matter what\"), degree of probability (\"It must be raining by now\", \"It may be raining\", \"It might be raining\"), or ability (\"I can speak French\"). All languages can express modality with adverbs, but some also use verbal forms as in the given examples. If the verbal expression of modality involves the use of an auxiliary verb, that auxiliary is called a modal verb. If the verbal expression of modality involves inflection, we have the special case of mood; moods include the indicative (as in \"I am there\"), the subjunctive (as in \"I wish I \"were\" there\"), and the imperative (\"Be there!\").\nVoice.\nThe voice of a verb expresses whether the subject of the verb is performing the action of the verb or whether the action is being performed on the subject. The two most common voices are the active voice (as in \"I saw the car\") and the passive voice (as in \"The car was seen by me\" or simply \"The car was seen\").\nNon-finite forms.\nMost languages have a number of verbal nouns that describe the action of the verb.\nIn the Indo-European languages, verbal adjectives are generally called participles. English has an active participle, also called a present participle; and a passive participle, also called a past participle. The active participle of \"break\" is \"breaking\", and the passive participle is \"broken\". Other languages have attributive verb forms with tense and aspect. This is especially common among verb-final languages, where attributive verb phrases act as relative clauses.\nSee also.\nVerbs in various languages.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nGrammar.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "37357", "revid": "43944218", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37357", "title": "Boise, Idaho", "text": "Capital of Idaho, U.S.\nBoise (, also ) is the capital and most populous city of the U.S. state of Idaho. Boise is the county seat of Ada County. The population of the city was 235,685 at the 2020 census. The Boise metropolitan area, also known as the Treasure Valley, includes five counties of Idaho with an estimated population of 846,000, the most populous metropolitan area in Idaho and 74th-most populous in the United States.\nLocated on the Boise River in southwestern Idaho, it is east of the Oregon border and north of the Nevada border. Downtown Boise's elevation is above sea level. Originally established as a military outpost in 1863 during the gold rush era, Boise rapidly grew due to its location on the Oregon Trail and its proximity to mining operations in the surrounding region. By the late 19th century, it had become a commercial and transportation hub, bolstered by the arrival of the railroad and irrigation projects that supported agriculture in the Treasure Valley.\nWhile agriculture and food processing remain important, Boise is home to major employers in the technology, manufacturing, and service sectors, including companies such as Micron Technology and Hewlett-Packard. Government, education, and healthcare also play significant roles in the local economy. The city is home to the Boise Art Museum, Idaho State Capitol, the annual Treefort Music Fest, and the Basque Block, showcasing its Basque heritage. Additionally, the Boise greenbelt and nearby public lands offer recreational opportunities that are integral to the city's identity.\nHistory.\nEtymology.\nThe origin of the name is uncertain. One account credits Capt. B. L. E. Bonneville of the U.S. Army as its source. After trekking for weeks through dry and rough terrain, his exploration party reached an overlook with a view of the Boise River Valley. The place where they stood is called Bonneville Point, located on the Oregon Trail east of the city. According to the story, a French-speaking guide, overwhelmed by the sight of the verdant river, yelled \"\" (\"The woods! The woods!\")\u2014and the name stuck.\nThe name may also derive from earlier mountain men who named the river that flows through the city. In the 1820s, French Canadian fur trappers associated with the British-owned Hudson's Bay Company set trap lines in the vicinity. Set in a high-desert area, the tree-lined valley of the Boise River became a distinct landmark, an oasis dominated by cottonwood trees. This led the French trappers to call the area \"\" (\"the wooded river\").\nPronunciation.\nMost local and longtime residents use the pronunciation (BOY-see), as given on the city's website. The pronunciation is sometimes used as a shibboleth, as those from elsewhere tend to pronounce the city's name as (BOY-zee). In French, the name of the city is pronounced (Bwaz).\nTribes and First Contact.\nThe area of Boise valley was inhabited by Boise Valley Shoshone and Bannock tribes, a part of the \"Snake Country\". According to the City of Boise's \"History of Boise\" report, \"they gathered annually in the valley to participate in trading rendezvous with other tribes and catch salmon in the Boise River runs to help sustain them year-round. They spent winters in the valley where the climate was milder and visited the hot springs for bathing and healing. Castle Rock, called Eagle Rock by the tribes, was and remains a sacred site.\"\nBoise Valley Bannock tribes belonged to the \"tuu\u02c0agaid\u0268ka\u02c0a\" (black trout eaters). Boise Valley Shoshone belonged to the \"Yahandeka\" (groundhog eaters) grouping. They were among the early mounted Shoshone bands. They traveled over a considerable range by the beginning of the nineteenth century, with their main hunting lands along the lower Boise River and Payette River. When Donald MacKenzie developed the Snake country fur trade after 1818, the most prominent of the Boise Shoshone, Peiem (a Shoshoni rendition of \"Big Jim\", their leader's English name), became the most influential leader of the large composite Shoshoni band that white trappers regularly encountered in the Snake Country.\nIn 1811, Wilson Hunt, employed as an agent in the fur trade under John Jacob Astor, organized and led the greater part of a group of about 60 men on an overland expedition to establish a fur trading outpost at the mouth of the Columbia River. This expedition passed through the Boise valley, and was the first ever time a white American has entered the region. Because of the War of 1812 and the lack of U.S. fur trading posts in the Pacific Northwest, most of the route was not used in the following two decades, and thus Snake Country remained free of settler incursions.\nAfter the conclusion of the war of 1812, until the 1840s, Oregon, while officially \"jointly administered\", was solely dominated by the British Hudson's Bay Company (HBC), which had a land connection to the inland of the Canadian Prairies via York Factory Express. Snake Country, including Boise Valley remained independent and relatively free of settler passage and incursion. There were two main reasons for this. Firstly, the general region east of the Cascades and west of the Rockies was described at the time in the media and literature of the eastern US as the \"Great American Desert\", an arid unproductive region, unsuitable for habitation. This discouraged settlers from traveling to the region of Boise; however, Oregon Country, on the other side of the Cascades, was a desirable destination for them. Nevertheless, the British had an official policy of discouraging American settlers, and settler incursions into Boise Valley along the Oregon Trail remained low until the early 1840s.\nThe HBC established a fort in the region, the Old Fort Boise, west, near Parma, down the Boise River near its confluence with the Snake River at the Oregon border. The HBC was present at the fort until 1844, and afterward handed it over to the United States Army.\nOregon Trail.\nStarting from early 1840s, developments further West, in modern Oregon, meant significant changes to the region of Boise. At this time, HBC and the British started moving their operations further North into British Columbia, while there was a slow and steady rise in number of settlers in Oregon Country, who demanded annexation. These developments eventually culminated in the Oregon Treaty, in which the British gave the region up to the US, thus ending the era of \"Joint occupation\". This meant that Boise valley and much of Snake Country was claimed as Oregon Territory.\nWith the discovery of gold in California in 1848 and the passage of Donation Land Claim Act, the settler incursions increased exponentially. The increased settler incursions through Shoshone and Bannock territories, and their increased exploitation of the valley's game and resources on their trip, resulted in an increasing sense of frustration among the Indigenous bands along the entire Oregon Trail. Thus, starting from early 1850s, to deter settler caravans from using the route and trespassing on their lands, Native peoples along the entire length of the trail, from modern Eastern Idaho to modern Central Oregon started staging low-intensity attacks against passing caravans.\nOne such attack, referred to as \"Ward Massacre\", was in Boise Valley, about 20 miles west of modern Boise. On August 20, 1854, Alexander Ward's five-wagon caravan of 20 emigrants was passing through, when a group of Shoshone and Bannock warriors ambushed the caravan. The goal of the ambush was initially to take away the horses of the caravan. However, the shooting of one of the Shoshone warriors with a revolver, resulted in the killing of everyone except for two of Alexander Ward's children by the Shoshone warriors. In response, the United States Army launched the Winnas Expedition, which involved raids on Native encampments for a period of several months during Summer of 1855. In the period between 1846 and 1856, 700 white settlers were killed along the entire length of the Oregon Trail due to attacks and raids by Native warriors on their caravans while intruding native land. American military intrusion and retaliation only further angered the native tribes and escalated the conflict, which forced the United States Army to abandon Old Fort Boise. Intensified attacks against passing caravans made travel impossible for settlers except with US Army escort, which started from 1858.\nDiscovery of gold and silver.\nThe decline of the California gold rush prompted white settlers to search for gold elsewhere, including much of Idaho. The 1860 discovery of gold in Nez Perce territory near Pierce, Idaho and the resultant arrival of settlers raised tensions significantly. In September of that year, the Utter Party Massacre happened about 100 miles Southeast of Boise, where 29 out of a group of 44 settlers were either killed or captured in an intense and organized ambush.\nThe discovery of gold around the Boise valley in 1863, together with ongoing fighting prompted the US Military to establish a new Fort Boise, where Boise is located today. The new location was selected because it was near the intersection of the Oregon Trail with a major road connecting the Boise Basin (Idaho City) and the Owyhee (Silver City) mining areas, both of which were booming. That year, the United States established Idaho Territory, whose boundaries included this region. After a year, with the creation of Montana Territory, Boise was made the territorial capital of a much reduced Idaho in a controversial decision which overturned a district court ruling by a one-vote majority in the territorial supreme court along geographic lines in 1866. There was no treaty and no agreement with any of the native tribes up to this point, and the violent resistance against incursion and settlement onto their territory along the Oregon Trail and at the newly-found gold mines continued unabated. In order to resolve the matter of ownership and sovereignty over land, Caleb Lyon, the second governor of Idaho, negotiated with the Boise Valley Shoshone Tribe, and concluded the \"Treaty of Fort Boise\" on October 10, 1864. This treaty stipulated that the tribe will give up lands to 30 miles on each side of Boise River, land upon which Boise is located, while allowing an equal right to fishing in the river to both the Shoshone and the settlers. The treaty has not been ratified by the US senate to this date, and the tribe hasn't ever received any treaty payments.\nBacklash from the perceived friendliness of Caleb Lyon in his dealing with the tribes led to an escalation of pressure and agitation among the White Settlers in Boise and the print media in the city, in demanding either genocide or removal of the tribes. Settler violence against Boise Valley native tribes increased considerably, with some going as far introducing bounties to murder any native. \"Idaho Statesman\", the daily newspaper of Boise, which started publishing in 1864, reflected many such incitements and demands:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;...that the military should continue killing Indians 'until the last Indian in the Territories was either on his reservation or enriched the sagebrush with his decaying carcass.' ...if the Indians refused to move there, 'they will be killed or put on the reservation by force, and certainly shot if they don't stay there.' Furthermore, the editor continues, 'The idea that the Indians have any right to the soil is ridiculous. ...They have no more rights to the soil of the Territories of the United States than wolves or coyotes...'\u2014\u200a\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;This would be our plan of establishing friendship upon an eternal basis with our Indians: Let all the hostile bands of Idaho Territory be called in (they will not be caught in any\nother manner) to attend a grand treaty; plenty of blankets and nice little trinkets distributed among them; plenty of grub on hand; have a real jolly time with them; then just before the big feast put strychnine in their meat and poison to death the last mother's son of them.\u2014\u200a\nAt the same time, native warriors around the valley, under the leadership of Howluck also known as \"Bigfoot\" among white settlers, among others, waged an escalating and intensified guerrilla campaign of harassment of passerby caravans along the Oregon Trail. The United States Army also escalated and intensified \"punitive expeditions\" against formations of warriors and against civilian communities as well. This marked the start of the \"unofficial\" Snake War in 1866. This war lasted until 1868, and is statistically the deadliest of the Indian Wars in the West in terms of casualties. In the end, 1,762 men were counted as the casualties of this war from both sides.\nIn 1868, Fort Hall Indian Reservation was established in Southeastern Idaho, about 220 miles upstream, according to the terms of Fort Bridger Treaty. The Boise Valley Shoshone and Bannock Tribes were not party to this treaty. Nevertheless, in April 1869, the United States Military embarked on a campaign of \"Removal, rounding up of natives in the region including in and around Boise, and expelling them with cavalry escort to Fort Hall Indian Reservation. This period is known among the Shoshone and Bannock people as Idaho's Trail of Tears. Some of the natives managed to escape, and they ran to either Duck Valley or Fort McDermitt in Nevada.\nIncorporation and growth.\nBoise's early growth was significantly driven by its role in supplying the nearby gold towns that sprung up in the 1860s northeast and then southwest of the town. Miners sometimes wintered in Boise and a number of early prominent businessmen were miners who settled in town in the years after the gold rush waned. By 1864 substantial agricultural production was underway on easily irrigated lands near the river and three canal companies had been incorporated. Early transportation improvements were largely a result of toll road franchises awarded by the territorial legislature starting in the 1860s. These first ran from Fort Boise to the mining centers in the Boise Basin and east to Rocky Bar and to Rattlesnake Station where they connected to the Oregon Trail.\nTerritorial census records from a special 1864 enumeration list the population of Boise as 1,658, and an act of December 12, 1864, was the first attempt by the Idaho Territorial Legislature to incorporate the city. This was rejected by voters the following March. Two more unsuccessful attempts were made to organize a city administration by election before the 1866 version of the city charter was approved by voters on January 6, 1868. The growing number of homes and businesses, for which owners wanted proper legal title, may have contributed to the eventual success of incorporation. All of these rejected efforts to incorporate the city came \"after\" Boise had been controversially made the state capital in 1864 over strong opposition from northern Idaho interests. This decision reflected the rapid shift of population growth from north to south after the discovery of gold in southern Idaho. By 1868 Boise had over 400 permanent buildings with a wide range of commercial services. 1868 also marked the formal beginning of a long advocacy for railroad connections to other Idaho communities and, just as importantly, to other growing cities in the west such as Portland, Oregon. Competing railroad and western state government interests frustrated these efforts for many years.\nDesigned by Alfred B. Mullett, the U.S. Assay Office at 210 Main Street was built in 1871 and today is a National Historic Landmark. It first began accepting gold and silver for purchase on March 2, 1872, largely eliminating the need to transport ore to the mint in San Francisco. A territorial penitentiary, now known as the Old Idaho State Penitentiary, opened the same month several miles east of town. Mining continued to be important to Boise's economic growth and periodic booms contributed to population growth as well, though production of gold and silver probably peaked in the 1860s. 1882's gold and silver production of $3,500,000 declined to $1,488,315 (including lead) by 1899.\nBoise began to earn its \"City of Trees\" nickname in this period with a popular focus on a range of tree planting projects. Thomas J. Davis planted several thousand fruit trees in 1864 and several other early businessmen either founded nurseries or orchards of their own. In the 1870s tree planting began in earnest in downtown Boise led by prominent hotels as well as businessmen and residents. In 1907 Davis donated 43 acres of his orchard property to the city for use as a park in the name of his wife Julia. Commercial agriculture continued to expand, but was slowed by the lack of reliable rail links to regional and national markets and by a lack of large scale irrigation projects, which themselves were often tied to hoped-for railroad projects for financing. A.D. Foote, a successful mining engineer, drew up plans to irrigate up to 500,000 acres immediately south of Boise in 1882, but progress was halting and smaller farms were the norm until after the turn of the century with most located near to the river bottom where soil was productive and irrigation more easily achieved. Fruit orchards proliferated and sugar beets, still an important agricultural industry in Idaho, began to be widely cultivated in the 1890s. Cattle and sheep farming became increasingly important as the century closed. With the exception of dairy, most livestock products were exported from Idaho, unlike other agricultural products which were still largely scaled to support local markets. The timber industry also increasingly thrived in the Boise market in the 1880s and 1890s. Large quantities of timber were exported from elsewhere in Idaho, but a growing Boise supported the expansion of Alexander Rossi's sawmill, first established in 1865. Prominent early Boisean William Ridenbaugh had inherited control of the canal now bearing his name from his uncle William Morris in 1878 and later partnered with Rossi to expand the sawmill capacity under the name Rossi and Ridenbaugh Lumber Company. Their materials supported bridge building and the rapid expansion of Boise in the 1890s.\nAs with many early infrastructure ventures, electrification succeeded only after at least one false start. July 4, 1887, marked the start of electrical transmission from a plant located on the Bench. William Ridenbaugh provided expertise and manpower for the water supply and several months were spent rigging poles and lines from the Bench to the service area across the river. Additional electrical supplies allowed the building of an electric streetcar line in 1891. This ran without interruption until buses replaced the lines in 1927, tracking\u2014and sometimes driving\u2014the development of Boise and nearby communities. This system expanded over several decades, reaching into the North End, South Boise and across the river on Front St. A loop line, completed in 1912, ran as far as Caldwell and Nampa, providing transport throughout the valley. Three early trolley companies merged in 1912 to form the Idaho Traction Company with a depot at 7th and Bannock Streets downtown.\nAdditional services and urban amenities arrived in the 1890s as Boise grew. Exploratory drilling for hot water was successful in 1890 and by the end of the decade many homes along Warm Springs avenue were being heated by this source. A natatorium was built in 1892 close to the source of the hot water near the Idaho State Penitentiary. Churches serving several denominations, a Jewish synagogue, a major hardware store and department store, a Masonic hall, the Columbia Theater, Saint Alphonsus' Hospital, a number of parochial and secular schools, a City Hall and a new Union Pacific passenger station, constructed when service was finally extended to downtown, were all built during the 1890s. Falk's Department Store sponsored a semi-professional baseball team representing Boise from at least 1892 and the city supported other organized sports as they became popular. The 12th Census of the United States lists the population of Boise in 1900 as 5,957, up from 2,311 in 1890, when Idaho was admitted as the 43rd state.\n20th and 21st centuries.\nIn 1925, with the construction of Chicago-Portland railway line, Boise Union Pacific Depot was established in the city. This train station served passengers until 1997.\nA \"homosexual panic\" erupted in the city in 1955 during the lavender scare. Police interrogated hundreds of Boise citizens, arresting sixteen men whom police believed were part of a \"homosexual ring.\" Arrests included prominent citizens, including a bank vice president. Their trials, which received sensational coverage in the local press, resulted in lengthy prison sentences; one man was sentenced to life in prison.\nIn 2019, the city council approved the renaming of a park and natural preserve to names in the Shoshoni language to recognize their significance to local indigenous peoples.\nGeography.\nBoise is in southwestern Idaho, about east of the Oregon border and north of the Nevada border. The downtown area's elevation is above sea level.\nMost of the metropolitan area lies on a broad, flat plain, descending to the west. Mountains rise to the northeast, stretching from the far southeastern tip of the Boise city limits to nearby Eagle. These mountains are known to locals as the Boise foothills and are sometimes described as the foothills of the Rocky Mountains. About southwest of Boise, and about southwest of Nampa, the Owyhee Mountains lie entirely in neighboring Owyhee County.\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the city has an area of , of which is land and is water. The city is drained by the Boise River and is considered part of the Treasure Valley.\nNeighborhoods and areas.\nBoise occupies an area of , according to the United States Census Bureau. Neighborhoods of Boise include the Bench, the North End, West Boise and Downtown. In January 2014, the Boise Police Department partnered with the neighborhood blogging site Nextdoor, the first city in the Northwest and the 137th city in the U.S. to do so. Since the app, which enables the city's police, fire, and parks departments to post to self-selected, highly localized areas, first became available in October 2011, 101 neighborhoods and sections of neighborhoods have joined.\nDowntown Boise.\nDowntown Boise is Boise's cultural center and home to many small businesses as well as a growing number of high-rises. While downtown Boise lacks a major retail/dining focus like Seattle and Portland, the area has a variety of shops and growing option for dining choices. Centrally, 8th Street contains a pedestrian zone with sidewalk cafes and restaurants. The neighborhood has many local restaurants, bars, and boutiques and supports a vibrant nightlife. The area contains the Basque Block, which gives visitors a chance to learn about and enjoy Boise's Basque heritage. Downtown Boise's main attractions include the Idaho State Capitol, the classic Egyptian Theatre on the corner of Capitol Boulevard and Main Street, the Boise Art Museum on Capitol in front of Julia Davis Park, and Zoo Boise on the grounds of Julia Davis Park.\nBoise's economy was threatened in the late 1990s by commercial development at locations away from the downtown center, such as Boise Towne Square Mall and at shopping centers near new housing developments.\nCultural events in Downtown Boise include Alive after Five and First Thursday.\nBoise State University.\nTo the south of downtown Boise is Boise State University and its surrounding environs. The area is dominated by residential neighborhoods and businesses catering to the student population. The unique blue playing field at the 37,000-seat Albertsons Stadium on the BSU campus, home to the Boise State Broncos football team, is a major city landmark. Other cultural and sports centers in the area include the Velma V. Morrison Center for the Performing Arts and ExtraMile Arena. Broadway Avenue to the east and south of the BSU campus features many college-themed bars and restaurants.\nThe North End.\nThe North End, generally defined as the part of Boise north of State Street, contains many of the city's older homes. It is known for its tree-lined drives such as Harrison Boulevard, and for its quiet neighborhoods near the downtown area. Downtown Boise is visible from Camel's Back Park. On 13th Street, Hyde Park is home to restaurants and other businesses. The North End also hosts events such as the annual Hyde Park Street Fair. In 2008, the American Planning Association designated Boise's North End one of 10 Great Neighborhoods.\nBoise Highlands.\nThe Boise Highlands is just north of the North End; its location is generally defined as north of Hill Road and east of Bogus Basin Road. Annexed by the city in late 1965, the neighborhood is mostly filled with homes constructed in the 1970s, as well as the golf course of Crane Creek Country Club.\nSouthwest Boise.\nSouthwest Boise contains sparsely populated neighborhoods built from the 1960s to the early 1980s. Many include acre-sized plots and the occasional farmhouse and pasture. In the 1980s, growth in the area was stunted to prevent urban sprawl. Since this has been lifted, there has been widespread growth of new homes and neighborhoods. The area lies near Interstate 84, and features, the Boise Airport, theaters, shopping, golf and the Boise Bench area.\nNorthwest Boise.\nNorthwest Boise lies against the Boise Foothills to the north, State Street to the south, the city of Eagle to the west, and downtown Boise to the east. It contains a mix of old and new neighborhoods, including Lakeharbor, which features the private Silver Lake, a reclaimed quarry. Northwest Boise has some pockets of older homes with a similar aesthetic to the North End. Downtown is minutes away, as is Veteran's Memorial Park and easy access to the Boise Greenbelt. Across the river sits the Boise Bench and to the west are the bedroom communities of Eagle, Star, and Middleton.\nWarm Springs and East End.\nWarm Springs is centered on the tree-lined Warm Springs Avenue and contains some of Boise's largest and most expensive homes (many of which were erected by wealthy miners and businessmen around the turn of the 20th century; Victorian styles feature prominently). The area gets its name from the natural hot springs that flow from Boise's fault line and warm many of the area's homes. The Natotorium public swim center is here.\nHarris Ranch and Riverland East.\nThe far-east end of Warm Springs was once known as Barber Town, featuring a hotel with hot springs nestled into the foothills. It now has some new residential developments, with easy access to Highway 21, which leads to the south-central Idaho mountains, the Boise River, the Boise Foothills, Idaho Department of Parks and Recreation, and the Idaho Shakespeare Festival.\nSoutheast Boise.\nSoutheast Boise ranges from Boise State University to Micron Technology between Federal Way and the Boise River. Its oldest neighborhood, Original South Boise, was platted in 1890, and accordingly has variegated housing (assiduously maintained by zoning); it consists of 33 blocks bordered by W Beacon Street, S Boise Avenue, and S Broadway Avenue, and hence is a triangular neighborhood immediately adjoining BSU. The rest of Southeast Boise was developed over the decades, largely by a variety of suburban-style homes.\nColumbia Village subdivision and the older Oregon Trail Heights were the first major planned communities in Southeast Boise with an elementary and middle school all within walking distance from all homes. The subdivision is at the intersections of Interstate 84, Idaho 21, and Federal Way (former U.S. Highway), which are all major arteries to get anywhere in Boise. The subdivision, a baseball complex, and swimming pools were developed around the Simplot Sports complex. The fields are built over an old landfill and dump, and the fields and gravel parking lot allow radon gases to escape through the ground. The most recent planned community is the Bown Crossing, which has easy access to the Boise Greenbelt.\nOn August 25, 2008, at about 7:00\u00a0pm, a fire started near Amity and Holcomb during a major windstorm. It destroyed ten houses and damaged nine. One person died in the fire.\nBoise Bench.\nThe Bench, generally bounded by Federal Way to the east, Cole Road to the west and Garden City to the north, sits on an elevation approximately higher than downtown Boise to its northeast. Orchard Street is a major north\u2013south thoroughfare in the neighborhood. The Bench is so named because of this sudden rise, giving the appearance of a step, or bench. The Bench (or Benches, there are three actual benches in the Boise Valley) was created as an ancient shoreline to the old river channel. The Bench is home to the Boise Union Pacific Depot. Like the North End, the Bench has older residential areas such as the Central Rim, Morris Hill, and Depot Bench neighborhoods. Due south of the Bench is the Boise Airport.\nWest Boise.\nWest Boise is home to Boise Towne Square Mall, the largest in the state, as well as many restaurants, strip malls, and residential developments ranging from new subdivisions to apartment complexes. The Ada County jail and Hewlett-Packard's printing division are also here. It is relatively the flattest section of Boise, with sweeping views of the Boise Front. West Boise also borders the city of Meridian.\nClimate.\nBoise has a cool semi-arid climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification \"BSk\", Trewartha climate classification \"BSak\"), with four distinct seasons. Boise has similar temperatures and precipitation patterns as that of a Mediterranean climate (Koppen: \"Csa\"). Boise experiences hot and dry summers with highs reaching nine days in a typical year and on 55 days. Yet because of the aridity, average diurnal temperature variation exceeds in the height of summer. Winters are moderately cold, with a December average of , and lows falling to or below on around one night per year, with some winters having several such readings and most having none at all. Snowfall averages , but typically falls in bouts of or less. Spring and fall are mild. Extremes have ranged from on January 16, 1888, to on July 12, 1898, and July 19, 1960; temperatures have reached and as recently as December 22, 1990, and August 10, 2018, respectively. Precipitation is usually infrequent and light, especially so during the summer months. It averages approximately annually.\nTornadoes are rare in Ada County and the Boise area. Since 1950, only twelve tornadoes have been documented within the county, and four of those were during the same storm on August 3, 2000, which is also the most recent date a tornado was documented in the area. None of the tornadoes have been ranked higher than an F1 on the Fujita scale, and no injuries or fatalities were ever documented.\nDemographics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"US Census population/styles.css\"/&gt;\n2020 census.\nThe 2020 U.S. census counted 235,684 people, 97,456 households, and 56,662 families in Boise.

At the site of what was originally the Johann D.\u00a0C. Thiessen mansion and ranch, now Locomotive Park, so named because of the retired locomotive Steam Engine\u00a092 and Camas Prairie\u00a0RR Caboose on display in the middle, large trees and pathways are decorated with lights from Thanksgiving to New Year's. These events are sponsored by the Chamber of Commerce, and the displays involved are typically quite impressive and often attract many visitors.\nDuring the Christmas and Easter seasons, the Lewiston Jaycees have two large lighted displays on the Lewiston Hill (technically, the Washington side, and specifically, in Whitman County, above Clarkston in Washington state), visible from nearly everywhere in the valley. The display consists of long strings of ordinary light bulbs, arranged in the shape of a star (Christmas) and a cross (Easter). The same strings of lights are used in both displays, which, when lit, are left burning 24\u00a0hours a day through each season.\nEvery year, with cooperation from the city, Lewis-Clark State College hosts the Avista NAIA\u00a0World Series for college baseball in May, and the Lewiston Round Up rodeo in September. The Lewiston Round Up is a member of the Big\u00a04 or Big Money\u00a04 (along with Pendleton Round-Up, Walla Walla Fair and Rodeo, and Ellensburg Rodeo) and a top\u00a050 PRCA rodeo.\nLewiston had a popular Northwest League professional baseball franchise from 1952 through 1974. The Lewis-Clark Broncs were affiliated with various major league parent clubs, including the Philadelphia Phillies, Kansas City Athletics, St. Louis Cardinals, Baltimore Orioles, and Oakland Athletics (or A's). A roster check in 1967 showed that 40% of the players and coaches of the Kansas City Athletics had been in Lewiston at one time or another. Reggie Jackson was perhaps the most famous Lewiston Bronc of all-time; \"Mr.\u00a0October\" played twelve games for Lewiston at age 20 in 1966. The Broncs' rosters included Rick Monday, manager John McNamara, Vearl (\"Snag\") Moore, Thorton (\"Kip\") Kipper, Antonio Perez, Ron Koepper, Delmer Owen, Dick Green, Bud Swan, Bert Campaneris, John Israel, Dave Duncan, Al Heist, and as a player, later coach-manager Robert (\"Gabby\") Williams. After years of financial losses, the team was shut down in Lewiston in January 1975, and resurfaced in June in southwestern Idaho as the Boise\u00a0A's for \nEducation.\nLewiston is home to Lewis-Clark State College and the Lewiston School District; the latter operates public secondary schools, which are Lewiston High School, Jenifer Middle School, and Sacajawea Middle School. The seven elementary schools are Whitman, Webster, Centennial, Orchards, Camelot, McGhee, and McSorley.\nThe Northwest Children\u00b4s Home has a treatment facility in Lewiston.\nThe Lewiston School District is Independent School District #1.\nLewis-Clark State College is also the athletic home to the Warriors of the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA); LCSC's Harris Field ballpark hosts the NAIA World Series, of which the Warriors have won 19 national titles in baseball; the first sixteen were under head coach Ed Cheff.\nMedia.\nLewiston's newspaper is the \"Lewiston Morning Tribune\", founded in 1892. The local television station is KLEW-TV, a CBS affiliate which signed-on December\u00a07, 1955.\nInfrastructure.\nAirport.\nNonstop scheduled passenger airline service to Denver (DEN) via United Express, Salt Lake City (SLC) and Seattle-Tacoma (SEA) via Delta Connection is operated from the Lewiston - Nez Perce County Airport (LWS) with both air carriers operating regional jet aircraft on behalf of their respective major airline partners, United Airlines and Delta Air Lines.\nMarine highways.\nBecause of the system of locks and dams on the Columbia River such as the Lower Granite Dam, Lewiston is navigable by some ocean-going vessels and is the eastern terminus of Marine Highway M-84 of the United States Marine Highway Program which connects to the M-5 along the coast at Astoria, Oregon. At upstream of the Pacific Ocean (at the mouth of the Columbia River, adjacent to Astoria, Oregon), the Port of Lewiston has the distinction of being the most inland seaport east of the West Coast, and Idaho's only seaport.\nAlso, along much of the Snake River is a system of levees to protect against flooding; most are maintained by the U.S.\u00a0Army Corps of Engineers.\nReferences.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He was born in Herseaux, Belgium. When he was 16, he enrolled in decorative art at Saint-Luc de Tournai. He finished his studies in 1951 with the greatest distinction. He returned as a teacher two years later.\nThe Belgian publisher La Procure \u00e0 Namur organised a drawing contest. They were interested in finding talented artists to illustrate works for school children. Marlier won the competition. Two books resulted from this and these books guided a whole generation of Belgian children through the first few years of school, \"I Read with Michel and Nicole\" and \"I Calculate with Michel and Nicole\". Marlier's collaboration with La Procure \u00e0 Namur lasted more than 25 years.\nPierre Servais at Casterman, a Belgian publishing company, began to notice Marlier's drawings in 1951. He suggested that Marlier should illustrate a series of books for children. The result was editions of Alexandre Dumas' adventure books. This was followed in 1953 by illustrations for a book by Jeanne Cappe about two very similar rabbits. Marlier also took part in the Farandole series, intended for children.\nFrom 1954, Marlier illustrated the children's series \"Martine\", with the stories written by Gilbert Delahaye. This series spans over 50 issues and has been translated in numerous languages.\nIn 1969, Marlier also created his own series of children's books, \"Jean-Lou and Sophie\".\nHe died in Tournai on 18 January 2011.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "37368", "revid": "6326132", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37368", "title": "General Atomics MQ-1 Predator", "text": "Family of unmanned aerial vehicles\nThe General Atomics MQ-1 Predator (often referred to as the Predator drone) is an American remotely piloted aircraft (RPA) built by General Atomics that was used primarily by the United States Air Force (USAF) and Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). Conceived in the early 1990s for aerial reconnaissance and forward observation roles, the Predator carries cameras and other sensors. It was modified and upgraded to carry and fire two AGM-114 Hellfire missiles or other munitions. The aircraft entered service in 1995, and saw combat in the war in Afghanistan, Pakistan, the NATO intervention in Bosnia, the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia, the Iraq War, Yemen, the 2011 Libyan civil war, the 2014 intervention in Syria, and Somalia.\nThe USAF describes the Predator as a \"Tier II\" MALE UAS (medium-altitude, long-endurance unmanned aircraft system). The UAS consists of four aircraft or \"air vehicles\" with sensors, a ground control station (GCS), and a primary satellite link communication suite. Powered by a Rotax engine and driven by a propeller, the air vehicle can fly up to to a target, loiter overhead for 14\u00a0hours, then return to its base.\nThe MQ-1 Predator was the primary remotely piloted aircraft used for offensive operations by the USAF and the CIA in Afghanistan and the Pakistani tribal areas from 2001 until the introduction of the MQ-9 Reaper; it has also been deployed elsewhere. Because offensive uses of the Predator are classified by the U.S., U.S. military officials have reported an appreciation for the intelligence and reconnaissance-gathering abilities of RPAs but declined to publicly discuss their offensive use. The United States Air Force retired the Predator in 2018, replacing it with the Reaper.\nCivilian applications for drones have included border enforcement and scientific studies, and to monitor wind direction and other characteristics of large forest fires (such as the drone that was used by the California Air National Guard in the August 2013 Rim Fire).\nDevelopment.\nThe Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and the Pentagon began experimenting with unmanned reconnaissance aircraft (drones) in the early 1980s. The CIA preferred small, lightweight, unobtrusive drones, in contrast to the United States Air Force (USAF). In the early 1990s, the CIA became interested in the \"Amber\", a drone developed by Leading Systems, Inc. The company's owner, Abraham Karem, was the former chief designer for the Israeli Air Force, and had immigrated to the U.S. in the late 1970s. Karem's company went bankrupt and was bought by a U.S. defense contractor, from whom the CIA secretly bought five drones (now called the \"Gnat\"). Karem agreed to produce a quiet engine for the vehicle, which had until then sounded like \"a lawnmower in the sky\". The new development became known as the \"Predator\".\nGeneral Atomics Aeronautical Systems (GA) was awarded a contract to develop the Predator in January 1994, and the initial Advanced Concept Technology Demonstration (ACTD) phase lasted from January 1994 to June 1996. First flight took place on 3 July 1994 at the El Mirage airfield in the Mojave Desert. The aircraft itself was a derivative of the GA Gnat 750. During the ACTD phase, three systems were purchased from GA, comprising twelve aircraft and three ground control stations.\nFrom April through May 1995, the Predator ACTD aircraft were flown as a part of the Roving Sands 1995 exercises in the U.S. The exercise operations were successful which led to the decision to deploy the system to the Balkans later in the summer of 1995.\nDuring the ACTD, Predators were operated by a combined Army/Navy/Air Force/Marine team managed by the Navy's Joint Program Office for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (JPO-UAV) and first deployed to Gjader, Albania, for operations in the former Yugoslavia in spring 1995.\nBy the start of the United States Afghan campaign in 2001, the USAF had acquired 60 Predators, but lost 20 of them in action. Few if any of the losses were from enemy action, the worst problem apparently being foul weather, particularly icy conditions. Some critics within the Pentagon saw the high loss rate as a sign of poor operational procedures. In response to the losses caused by cold weather conditions, a few of the later USAF Predators were fitted with de-icing systems, along with an uprated turbocharged engine and improved avionics. This improved \"Block 1\" version was referred to as the \"RQ-1B\", or the \"MQ-1B\" if it carried munitions; the corresponding air vehicle designation was \"RQ-1L\" or \"MQ-1L\".\nThe Predator system was initially designated the RQ-1 Predator. The \"R\" is the United States Department of Defense designation for reconnaissance and the \"Q\" refers to an unmanned aircraft system. The \"1\" describes it as being the first of a series of aircraft systems built for unmanned reconnaissance. Pre-production systems were designated as RQ-1A, while the RQ-1B (not to be confused with the Predator B, which became the MQ-9 Reaper) denotes the baseline production configuration. These are designations of the \"system\" as a unit. The actual aircraft themselves were designated RQ-1K for pre-production models, and RQ-1L for production models. In 2002, the USAF officially changed the designation to MQ-1 (\"M\" for multi-role) to reflect its growing use as an armed aircraft.\nCommand and sensor systems.\nDuring campaign in the former Yugoslavia, a Predator's pilot would sit with several payload specialists in a van near the runway of the drone's operating base. Direct radio signals controlled the drone's takeoff and initial ascent, and then communications shifted to military satellite networks linked to the pilot's van. Pilots experienced a delay of several seconds between moving their sticks and the drone's response. But by 2000, improvements in communications systems made it possible, at least in theory, to fly the drone remotely from great distances. It was no longer necessary to use close-up radio signals during the Predator's takeoff and ascent. The entire flight could be controlled by satellite from any command and control center with the right equipment. The CIA proposed to attempt over Afghanistan the first fully remote Predator flight operations, piloted from the agency's headquarters at Langley.\nThe Predator air vehicle and sensors are controlled from the ground control station (GCS) via a C-band line-of-sight data link or a Ku-band satellite data link for beyond-line-of-sight operations. During flight operations the crew in the GCS is a pilot and two sensor operators. The aircraft is equipped with the AN/AAS-52 Multi-spectral Targeting System, a color nose camera (generally used by the pilot for flight control), a variable aperture day-TV camera, and a variable aperture thermographic camera (for low light/night). Previously, Predators were equipped with a synthetic aperture radar for looking through smoke, clouds or haze, but lack of use validated its removal to reduce weight and conserve fuel. The cameras produce full motion video and the synthetic aperture radar produced still frame radar images. There is sufficient bandwidth on the datalink for two video sources to be used together, but only one video source from the sensor ball can be used due to design limitations. Either the daylight variable aperture or the infrared electro-optical sensor may be operated simultaneously with the synthetic aperture radar, if equipped.\nAll later Predators are equipped with a laser designator that allows the pilot to identify targets for other aircraft and even provide the laser guidance for manned aircraft. This laser is also the designator for the AGM-114 Hellfire that are carried on the MQ-1.\nDeployment methodology.\nEach Predator air vehicle can be disassembled into six modules and loaded into a container. This enables all system components and support equipment to be rapidly deployed worldwide. The largest component is the ground control station (GCS) which is designed to roll into a C-130 Hercules. The Predator primary satellite link consists of a 6.1-meter (20-ft) satellite dish with associated support equipment. The satellite link provides communications between the GCS and the aircraft when it is beyond line-of-sight and links to networks that disseminate secondary intelligence. The RQ-1A system can operate on a 5,000 by 75 foot (1,524 meters by 23 meters) of hard surface runway with clear line-of-sight to each end from the GCS to the air vehicles. Initially, all components needed to be located on the same airfield.\nThe U.S. Air Force used a concept called \"Remote-Split Operations\" where the satellite datalink is placed in a different location and is connected to the GCS through fiber optic cabling. This allows Predators to be launched and recovered by a small \"Launch and Recovery Element\" and then handed off to a \"Mission Control Element\" for the rest of the flight. This allows a smaller number of troops to be deployed to a forward location, and consolidates control of the different flights in one location.\nThe improvements in the MQ-1B production version include an ARC-210 radio, an APX-100 IFF/SIF with mode 4, a glycol-weeping \"wet wings\" de-icing system, upgraded turbo-charged engine, fuel injection, longer wings, dual alternators as well as other improvements.\nOn 18 May 2006, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) issued a certificate of authorization which will allow the M/RQ-1 and M/RQ-9 aircraft to be used within U.S. civilian airspace to search for survivors of disasters. Requests had been made in 2005 for the aircraft to be used in search and rescue operations following Hurricane Katrina, but because there was no FAA authorization in place at the time, the assets were not used. The Predator's infrared camera with digitally enhanced zoom has the capability of identifying the infrared signature of a human body from an altitude of 3\u00a0km (10,000\u00a0ft), making the aircraft an ideal search and rescue tool.\nThe longest declassified Predator flight lasted for 40\u00a0hours and 5\u00a0minutes. The total flight time reached 1 million hours in April 2010, according to General Atomics Aeronautical Systems Inc.\nArmed versions.\nThe USAF BIG SAFARI program office managed the Predator program and was directed on 21 June 2000 to explore armament options. This led to reinforced wings with munitions storage pylons, as well as a laser designator. The RQ-1 conducted its first firing of a Hellfire anti-tank missile on 16 February 2001 over a bombing range near Indian Springs Air Force Station north of Las Vegas, Nevada, with an inert AGM-114C successfully striking a tank target. Then on 21 February 2001 the Predator fired three Hellfire missiles, scoring hits on a stationary tank with all three missiles. Following the February tests, phase two involved more complex tests to hunt for simulated moving targets from greater altitudes with the more advanced AGM-114K version. The armed Predators were put into service with the designation MQ-1A. The Predator gives little warning of attack because it is relatively quiet and the Hellfire is supersonic, so it strikes before it is heard by the target.\nIn the winter of 2000\u20132001, after seeing the results of Predator reconnaissance in Afghanistan, Cofer Black, head of the CIA's Counterterrorist Center (CTC), became a vocal advocate of arming the Predator with missiles to target Osama bin Laden in country. He believed that CIA pressure and practical interest were causing the USAF's armed Predator program to be significantly accelerated. Black, and \"Richard\", who was in charge of the CTC's Bin Laden Issue Station, continued to press during 2001 for a Predator armed with Hellfire missiles.\nFurther weapons tests occurred between 22 May and 7 June 2001, with mixed results. While missile accuracy was excellent, there were some problems with missile fuzing. In the first week of June, in the Nevada desert, a Hellfire missile was successfully launched on a replica of bin Laden's Afghanistan Tarnak residence. A missile launched from a Predator exploded inside one of the replica's rooms; it was concluded that any people in the room would have been killed. However, the armed Predator was not deployed before the September 11 attacks. \nThe USAF also investigated using the Predator to drop battlefield ground sensors and to carry and deploy the \"Finder\" mini-UAV.\nOther versions and fate.\nTwo unarmed versions, known as the General Atomics ALTUS were built, ALTUS I for the Naval Postgraduate School and ALTUS II for the NASA ERAST Project in 1997 and 1996, respectively.\nBased on the MQ-1 Predator, the General Atomics MQ-1C Gray Eagle was developed for the U.S. Army.\nThe USAF ordered a total of 259 Predators, but due to retirements and crashes the number in Air Force operation had declined to 154 as of May 2014. Budget proposals planned to retire the Predator fleet between FY 2015 and 2017 in favor of the larger MQ-9 Reaper, which has greater payload and range. The Predators were to be stored at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base or given to other agencies willing to take them. The U.S. Customs and Border Protection showed interest, but already had higher-performance Reapers and were burdened with operating costs. The U.S. Coast Guard also showed interest in land-based UAV surveillance. Foreign sales were also an option, but the MQ-1 is subject to limitations of the Missile Technology Control Regime because it can be armed; export markets are also limited by the existence of the Reaper. Given the Predator's pending phase-out and its size, weight, and power limitations, the Air Force decided not to pursue upgrades to make it more effective in contested environments, and determined its only use in defended airspace would be as a decoy to draw fire away from other aircraft. Due to airborne surveillance needs after the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) invaded Iraq, the Predator's retirement was delayed to 2018. MQ-1s will probably be placed in non-recoverable storage at the Boneyard and not sold to allies, although antenna, ground control stations, and other components may be salvaged for continued use on other airframes.\nGeneral Atomics completed the final RQ-1 ordered by Italy by October 2015, marking the end of Predator A production after two decades. The last Predator for the USAF was completed in 2011; later Predator aircraft were built on the Predator XP assembly line.\nThe United States Air Force announced plans to retire the MQ-1 on 9 March 2018. The Predator was officially retired from USAF service in March 2018.\nOperational history.\nAs of March 2009, the U.S. Air Force had 195 MQ-1 Predators and 28 MQ-9 Reapers in operation. Predators and Reapers fired missiles 244 times in Iraq and Afghanistan in 2007 and 2008. A report in March 2009 indicated that U.S. Air Force had lost 70 Predators in air crashes during its operational history. Fifty-five were lost to equipment failure, operator error, or weather. Five were shot down in Bosnia, Kosovo, Syria and Iraq. Eleven more were lost to operational accidents on combat missions. In 2012, the Predator, Reaper and Global Hawk were described as \"the most accident-prone aircraft in the Air Force fleet.\"\nOn 3 March 2011, the U.S. Air Force took delivery of its last MQ-1 Predator in a ceremony at General Atomics' flight operations facility. Since its first flight in July 1994, the MQ-1 series accumulated over 1,000,000 flight hours and maintained a fleet fully mission capable rate over 90 percent.\nOn 22 October 2013, the U.S. Air Force's fleets of MQ-1 Predators and MQ-9 Reaper remotely piloted aircraft reached 2,000,000 flight hours. The RPA program began in the mid-1990s, taking 16 years for them to reach 1 million flight hours. The 2 million hour mark was reached just two and a half years after that.\nOn 9 March 2018, the U.S. Air Force officially retired the MQ-1 Predator from operational service. The aircraft was first operationally deployed in 1995 and in 2011 the last of 268 Predators were delivered to the service, of which just over 100 were still in service by the start of 2018. While the Predator was phased out by the Air Force in favor of the heavier and more capable MQ-9 Reaper, the Predator continues to serve in the MQ-1C Gray Eagle derivative for the U.S. Army as well as with several foreign nations.\nSquadrons and operational units.\nDuring the initial ACTD phase, the United States Army led the evaluation program, but in April 1996, the Secretary of Defense selected the U.S. Air Force as the operating service for the RQ-1A Predator system. The 3d Special Operations Squadron at Cannon Air Force Base, 11th, 15th, 17th, and 18th Reconnaissance Squadrons, Creech Air Force Base, Nevada, and the Air National Guard's 163d Reconnaissance Wing at March Air Reserve Base, California, currently operate the MQ-1.\nIn 2005, the U.S. Department of Defense recommended retiring Ellington Field's 147th Fighter Wing's F-16 Fighting Falcon fighter jets (a total of 15 aircraft), which was approved by the Base Realignment and Closure committee. They will be replaced with 12 MQ-1 Predator UAVs, and the new unit should be fully equipped and outfitted by 2009. The wing's combat support arm will remain intact. The 272d Engineering Installation Squadron, an Air National Guard unit currently located off-base, will move into Ellington Field in its place.\nThe 3d Special Operations Squadron is currently the largest Predator squadron in the United States Air Force.\nU.S. Customs and Border Protection was reported in 2013 to be operating 10 Predators and to have requested 14 more.\nOn 21 June 2009, the United States Air Force announced that it was creating a new MQ-1 squadron at Whiteman Air Force Base that would become operational by February 2011. In September 2011, the U.S. Air National Guard announced that despite current plans for budget cuts, they will continue to operate the Air Force's combat UAVs, including MQ-1B.\nOn 28 August 2013, a Predator belonging to the 163d Reconnaissance Wing was flying at 18,000 to 20,000\u00a0feet over the Rim Fire in California providing infrared video of lurking fires, after receiving emergency approvals. Rules limit the Predator behavior; it must be accompanied by a manned aircraft, and its camera must only be active above the fire.\nIn September 2013, the Air Force Special Operations Command tested the ability to rapidly deploy Predator aircraft. Two MQ-1s were loaded into a Boeing C-17 Globemaster III in a cradle system that also carried a control terminal, maintenance tent, and the crew. The test was to prove the UAVs could be deployed and set up at an expeditionary base within four hours of landing. In a recent undisclosed deployment, airmen set up a portable hangar in a tent and a wooden taxiway to operate MQ-1s for a six-week period.\nThe Balkans.\nThe first overseas deployment took place in the Balkans, from July to November 1995, under the name \"Nomad Vigil\". Operations were based in Gjader, Albania. Four disassembled Predators were flown into Gjad\u00ebr airbase in a C-130 Hercules. The UAVs were assembled and flown first by civilian contract personnel. The U.S. deployed more than 70 military intelligence personnel. Intelligence collection missions began in 1995. \nOne of the Predators was lost over Krep\u0161i\u0107, near Br\u010dko, northern Bosnia, on 11 August 1995; a second one was deliberately destroyed on 14 August after suffering an engine failure over Bosnia, which may have been caused by hostile ground fire. Serb forces claim the shooting down of a third Predator over Nevesinje, Herzegovina, on 5 September, during Operation Deliberate Force. The wreckage of the first Predator was handed over to Russia, according to Serb sources. Its original 60-day stay was extended to 120 days. The following spring, in March 1996, the system was redeployed to the Balkans area and operated out of Taszar, Hungary.\nSeveral others were destroyed in the course of Operation Noble Anvil, the 1999 NATO bombing of Yugoslavia:\nAfghanistan.\nIn 2000, a joint CIA-DoD effort was agreed to locate Osama bin Laden in Afghanistan. Dubbed \"Afghan Eyes\", it involved a projected 60-day trial run of Predators over the country. The first experimental flight was held on 7 September 2000. White House security chief Richard A. Clarke was impressed by the resulting video footage; he hoped that the drones might eventually be used to target Bin Laden with cruise missiles or armed aircraft. Clarke's enthusiasm was matched by that of Cofer Black, head of the CIA's Counterterrorist Center (CTC), and Charles Allen, in charge of the CIA's intelligence-collection operations. The three men backed an immediate trial run of reconnaissance flights. Ten out of the ensuing 15 Predator missions over Afghanistan were rated successful. On at least two flights, a Predator spotted a tall man in white robes at bin Laden's Tarnak Farm compound outside Kandahar; the figure was subsequently deemed to be \"probably bin Laden\". By October 2000, deteriorating weather conditions made it difficult for the Predator to fly from its base in Uzbekistan, and the flights were suspended.\nOn 16 February 2001 at Nellis Air Force Base, a Predator successfully fired three Hellfire AGM-114C missiles into a target. The newly armed Predators were given the designation of MQ-1A. In the first week of June 2001, a Hellfire missile was successfully launched on a replica of bin Laden's Afghanistan Tarnak residence built at a Nevada testing site. A missile launched from a Predator exploded inside one of the replica's rooms; it was concluded that any people in the room would have been killed. On 4 September 2001 (after the Bush cabinet approved a Qaeda/Taliban plan), CIA chief Tenet ordered the agency to resume reconnaissance flights. The Predators were now weapons-capable, but did not carry missiles because the host country (presumably Uzbekistan) hadn't granted permission.\nSubsequent to 9/11, approval was quickly granted to ship the missiles, and the Predator aircraft and missiles reached their overseas location on 16 September 2001. The first mission was flown over Kabul and Kandahar on 18 September without carrying weapons. Subsequent host nation approval was granted on 7 October and the first armed mission was flown on the same day.\nOn 5 May 2013, an MQ-1 Predator surpassed 20,000 flight hours over Afghanistan by a single Predator. Predator P107 achieved the milestone while flying a 21-hour combat mission; P107 was first delivered in October 2004.\nPakistan.\nFrom at least 2003 until 2011, the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency has allegedly been operating the drones out of Shamsi airfield in Pakistan to attack militants in Pakistan's Federally Administered Tribal Areas. During this period, the MQ-1 Predator fitted with Hellfire missiles was successfully used to kill a number of prominent al Qaeda operatives.\nOn 13 January 2006, 18 civilians were unintentionally killed by the Predator. According to Pakistani authorities, the U.S. strike was based on faulty intelligence.\nIraq.\nAn Iraqi MiG-25 shot down a Predator performing reconnaissance over the no fly zone in Iraq on 23 December 2002. This was the first time in history a conventional aircraft and a drone had engaged each other in combat. Predators had been armed with AIM-92 Stinger air-to-air missiles, and were purportedly being used to \"bait\" Iraqi fighters, then run. However, the Predator's maximum speed is lower than the MiG-25's, and its service ceiling is nearly lower, making the \"run\" segment of any \"bait and run\" mission a difficult task. In this incident, the Predator did not run (or could not run fast enough), but instead fired one of its Stingers. The Stinger's heat-seeker became \"distracted\" by the MiG's missile and missed the MiG. The Predator was hit by the MiG's missile and destroyed. Another two Predators had been shot down earlier by Iraqi SAMs.\nDuring the initial phases of the 2003 U.S. invasion of Iraq, a number of older Predators were stripped down and used as decoys to entice Iraqi air defenses to expose themselves by firing. From July 2005 to June 2006, the 15th Reconnaissance Squadron participated in more than 242 separate raids, engaged 132 troops in contact-force protection actions, fired 59 Hellfire missiles; surveyed 18,490 targets, escorted four convoys, and flew 2,073 sorties for more than 33,833 flying hours.\nIraqi insurgents intercepted video feeds, which were not encrypted, using a $26 piece of Russian software named SkyGrabber. The encryption for the ROVER feeds was removed for performance reasons. Work to secure the data feeds was to be completed by 2014.\nOn 27 June 2014, the Pentagon confirmed that a number of armed Predators had been sent to Iraq along with U.S. Special Forces following advances by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. The Predators were flying 30 to 40 missions a day in and around Baghdad with government permission, and intelligence was shared with Iraqi forces. On 8 August 2014, an MQ-1 Predator fired a missile at a militant mortar position. From the beginning of Operation Inherent Resolve to January 2016, five USAF Predators were lost; four crashed from technical failures in Iraq, one in June 2015, two in October 2015, and one in January 2016.\nYemen.\nOn 3 November 2002, a Hellfire missile was fired at a car in Yemen, killing Qaed Salim Sinan al-Harethi, an al-Qaeda leader thought to be responsible for the USS \"Cole\" bombing. It was the first direct U.S. strike in the war on terrorism outside Afghanistan.\nIn 2004, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation's (ABC-TV) international affairs program \"Foreign Correspondent\" investigated this targeted killing and the involvement of the then U.S. Ambassador as part of a special report titled \"The Yemen Option\". The report also examined the evolving tactics and countermeasures in dealing with Al Qaeda inspired attacks.\nOn 30 September 2011, a Hellfire fired from an American UAV killed Anwar al-Awlaki, an American-citizen cleric and Al Qaeda leader, in Yemen. Also killed was Samir Khan, an American born in Saudi Arabia, who was editor of al-Qaeda's English-language webzine, \"Inspire\".\nOn 14 February 2017, a United Arab Emiates UAV MQ-1B was shot down by Houthi anti-aircraft missile over Marib province.\nOn 14 May 2019, a United Arab Emirates MQ-1 Predator was shot down by Houthi fire during a night flight in Saana, Houthi fighters used an air-to-air missile (R-27T or R-73) with a modified land operator device.\nOn 25 February 2022, Houthi forces shot down a UAEAF MQ-1 drone of the Saudi led Coalition in Al-Jawf province.

An MQ-1B fired its first Hellfire missile in the conflict on 23 April 2011, striking a BM-21 Grad. There are also some suggestions that a Predator was involved in the final attack against Gaddafi.\nPredators returned to Libya in 2012, after the attack that killed the US Ambassador in Benghazi. MQ-9 Reapers were also deployed.\nSomalia.\nOn 7 March 2016, US Predator drones attacked an al-Shabaab training camp south of Kismayo. Ibrahim al-Afghani, a senior al-Shabaab leader was rumored to be killed in the strike.\nFour al-Shabaab fighters, including a Kenyan, were killed in a drone strike late February 2012.\nIran.\nOn 1 November 2012, two Iranian Sukhoi Su-25 attack aircraft engaged an unarmed Predator conducting routine surveillance over the Persian Gulf just before 05:00 EST. The Su-25s made two passes at the drone firing their 30\u00a0mm cannon; the Predator was not hit and returned to base. The incident was not revealed publicly until 8 November. The U.S. stated that the Predator was over international waters, away from Iran and never entered its airspace. Iran states that the drone entered Iran's airspace and that its aircraft fired warning shots to drive it away.\nOn 12 March 2013, an Iranian F-4 Phantom pursued an MQ-1 flying over the Persian Gulf. The unarmed reconnoitering Predator was approached by the F-4, coming within 16\u00a0miles of the UAV. Two U.S. fighters were escorting the Predator and verbally warned the jet, which made the Iranian F-4 break off. All American aircraft remained over international waters. An earlier statement by the Pentagon that the escorting planes fired a flare to warn the Iranian jet was later amended. The Air Force later revealed that the American jet that forced the Iranian F-4 to break off was an F-22 Raptor.\nSyria.\nArmed MQ-1s are used in Operation Inherent Resolve against IS over Syria and Iraq. On 17 March 2015, a US MQ-1 was shot down by a Syrian government S-125 SAM battery when it overflew the port of Latakia, a region not involved in the international military operation.\nPhilippines.\nA 2012 \"New York Times\" article claimed that U.S. forces used a Predator drone to try and kill Indonesian terrorist Umar Patek in the Philippines in 2006. The Philippines' military denied this action took place, however. It was reported that a drone was responsible for killing al-Qaeda operative Zulkifli bin Hir on Jolo island on 2 February 2012. The strike reportedly killed 15 Abu Sayyaf operatives. The Philippines stated the strike was executed by manned North American / Rockwell OV-10 Bronco aircraft with assistance from the U.S.\nOther users.\nThe Predator has also been used by the Italian Air Force.

Ju\u00e1rez is recognized as a hero across the Americas for his resistance to European recolonization. Article 74 of the Mexican labor law (\"Ley Federal del Trabajo\") provides that the third Monday of March (regardless the date) will be an official holiday in Mexico. As with Constitution Day, the holiday was originally celebrated every year on the same date (March 21), but the federal labor law was modified in 2005 so the holiday is always celebrated on a Monday.\nLabor Day.\n\"D\u00eda del Trabajo\" () commemorates the Mexican workers' union movements on May 1 \u2014 specifically, the 1906 Cananea, Sonora, and the 1907 R\u00edo Blanco, Veracruz, labor unrest and repression.\nLabor Day in Mexico traces its origins to the 1886 Haymarket massacre in Chicago, but the first Labor Day in Mexico was when 20,000 workers marched against President Victoriano Huerta demanding fair working conditions in 1913. In 1923, President \u00c1lvaro Obreg\u00f3n declared May 1 the \"D\u00eda del Trabajo en M\u00e9xico\", but the day was officially established by Plutarco El\u00edas Calles in 1925.\nGrito de Dolores and Aniversario de la Independencia.\n\"Grito de Dolores\" (on the evening of September 15) and \"Aniversario de la Independencia\" (September 16) commemorate Father Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla's \"Grito de Dolores\" \u2014 on September 16, 1810, in the village of Dolores, near Guanajuato. Hidalgo called for the end of Spanish rule in Mexico. On October 18, 1825, the Republic of Mexico officially declared September 16 its national Independence Day (\"Dia de la Independencia\").\nMexican Independence day, also referred to as \"Diecis\u00e9is de septiembre\", is celebrated from the evening of September 15 with a re-creation of the \"Grito de Dolores\" by all executive office-holders (from the President of the Republic down to municipal presidents) and lasts through the night.\nAniversario de la Revoluci\u00f3n.\nThis day commemorates the Mexican Revolution which started on November 20, 1910, when Francisco I.

In the battle fought there the following year the French forces were the victor.\nIn contrast to Independence Day, described above, \"Cinco de mayo\" is observed mostly at a local level in Puebla State and is a minor Bank Holiday in the rest of Mexico. Many labor unions have negotiated to have the day off, however, since its proximity to Labor Day (May 1) often allows an extended five-day weekend or two consecutive three-day weekends. The first observance of Cinco de Mayo was in Los Angeles, California, in 1863. The observance sought to boost the spirits of American and Mexican residents during the dark days of the American Civil War and the Franco-Mexican War. Puebla would not hold its own celebrations until after the French were driven out of the city a few years later. See: Hayes-Bautista, Dr. David E. El Cinco de Mayo: An American Tradition.

{"id": "37373", "revid": "49409394", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37373", "title": "Paradise Lost", "text": "Epic poem by John Milton\nParadise Lost is an epic poem in blank verse by the English poet John Milton (1608\u20131674). The poem concerns the biblical story of the fall of man: the temptation of Adam and Eve by the fallen angel Satan and their expulsion from the Garden of Eden. The first version, published in 1667, consists of ten books with over ten thousand lines of verse. A second edition followed in 1674, arranged into twelve books (in the manner of Virgil's \"Aeneid\") with minor revisions throughout. It is considered to be Milton's masterpiece, and it helped solidify his reputation as one of the greatest English poets of all time.\nAt the heart of \"Paradise Lost\" are the themes of free will and the moral consequences of disobedience. Milton seeks to \"justify the ways of God to men,\" addressing questions of predestination, human agency, and the nature of good and evil. The poem begins \"in medias res\", with Satan and his fallen angels cast into Hell after their failed rebellion against God. Milton's Satan, portrayed with both grandeur and tragic ambition, is one of the most complex and debated characters in literary history, particularly for his perceived heroism by some readers.\nThe poem's portrayal of Adam and Eve emphasizes their humanity, exploring their innocence, before the Fall of Man, as well as their subsequent awareness of sin. Through their story, Milton reflects on the complexities of human relationships, the tension between individual freedom and obedience to divine law, and the possibility of redemption. Despite their transgression, the poem ends on a note of hope, as Adam and Eve leave Paradise with the promise of salvation through Christ.\nMilton's epic has been praised for its linguistic richness, theological depth, and philosophical ambition. However, it has also sparked controversy, particularly for its portrayal of Satan, whom some readers interpret as a heroic or sympathetic figure. \"Paradise Lost\" continues to inspire scholars, writers, and artists, remaining a cornerstone of literary and theological discourse.\nSynopsis.\nThe poem follows the epic tradition of starting \"in medias res\" (lit.\u2009'in the midst of things'), the background story being recounted, later.\nMilton's story has two narrative arcs, one about Satan (Lucifer) and the other about Adam and Eve. It begins after Satan and the other fallen angels have been defeated and banished to Hell, or, as it is also called in the poem, Tartarus. In Pand\u00e6monium, the capital city of Hell, Satan employs his rhetorical skill to organise his followers; he is aided by Mammon and Beelzebub; Belial, Chemosh, and Moloch are also present. At the end of the debate, Satan volunteers to corrupt the newly created Earth and God's new and most favoured creation, Mankind. He braves the dangers of the Abyss alone, in a manner reminiscent of Odysseus or Aeneas. After an arduous traversal of the Chaos outside Hell, he enters God's new material World, and later the Garden of Eden.\nAt several points in the poem, an Angelic War over Heaven is recounted from different perspectives. Satan's rebellion follows the epic convention of large-scale warfare. The battles between the faithful angels and Satan's forces take place over three days. At the final battle, the Son of God single-handedly defeats the entire legion of angelic rebels and banishes them from Heaven. Following this purge, God creates the World, culminating in his creation of Adam and Eve. While God gave Adam and Eve total freedom and power to rule over all creation, he gave them one explicit command: not to eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil on penalty of death. It is less often related that God was afraid that they would eat the fruit of the tree of life, and live forever.\nAdam and Eve are presented as having a romantic and sexual relationship while still being without sin. They have passions and distinct personalities. Satan, disguised in the form of a serpent, successfully tempts Eve to eat from the Tree by preying on her vanity and tricking her with rhetoric. Adam, learning that Eve has sinned, knowingly commits the same sin. He declares to Eve that since she was made from his flesh, they are bound to one another \u2013 if she dies, he must also die. In this manner, Milton portrays Adam as a heroic figure, but also as a greater sinner than Eve, as he is aware that what he is doing is wrong.\nAfter eating the fruit, Adam and Eve experience lust for the first time, which renders their next sexual encounter with one another unpleasant. At first, Adam is convinced that Eve was right in thinking that eating the fruit would be beneficial. However, they soon fall asleep and have terrible nightmares, and after they awake, they experience guilt and shame for the first time. Realising that they have committed a terrible act against God, they engage in mutual recrimination.\nMeanwhile, Satan returns triumphantly to Hell, amid the praise of his fellow fallen angels. He tells them about how their scheme worked and Mankind has fallen, giving them complete dominion over Paradise. As he finishes his speech, however, the fallen angels around him become hideous snakes, and soon enough, Satan himself turns into a snake, deprived of limbs and unable to talk. Thus, they share the same punishment, as they shared the same guilt.\nEve appeals to Adam for reconciliation of their actions. Her encouragement enables them to approach God, and plead for forgiveness. In a vision shown to him by the Archangel Michael, Adam witnesses everything that will happen to Mankind until the Great Flood. Adam is very upset by this vision of the future, so Michael also tells him about Mankind's potential redemption from original sin through Jesus Christ (whom Michael calls \"King Messiah\"). Adam and Eve are cast out of Eden, and Michael says that Adam may find \"a paradise within thee, happier far\". Adam and Eve now have a more distant relationship with God, who is omnipresent but invisible (unlike the tangible Father in the Garden of Eden).\nComposition.\nIt is uncertain when Milton composed \"Paradise Lost\". John Aubrey (1626\u20131697), Milton's contemporary and biographer, says that it was written between 1658 and 1663. However, parts of the poem had likely been in development since Milton was young. Having gone blind in 1652, Milton wrote \"Paradise Lost\" entirely through dictation with the help of amanuenses and friends. He was often ill, suffering from gout, and suffering emotionally after the early death of his second wife, Katherine Woodcock, in 1658, and their infant daughter. The image of Milton dictating the poem to his daughters became a popular subject for paintings, especially in the Romantic period.\nThe Milton scholar John Leonard also notes that Milton \"did not at first plan to write a biblical epic\". Since epics were typically written about heroic kings and queens (and with pagan gods), Milton originally envisioned his epic to be based on a legendary Saxon or British king like the legend of King Arthur. Leonard speculates that the English Civil War interrupted Milton's earliest attempts to start his \"epic [poem] that would encompass all space and time\".\nPublication.\nIn the 1667 version of \"Paradise Lost\", the poem was divided into ten books. However, in the 1674 edition, the text was reorganized into twelve books. In later printing, \"Arguments\" (brief summaries) were inserted at the beginning of each book. Milton's previous work had been printed by Matthew Simmons who was favoured by radical writers. However, he died in 1654 and the business was then run by Mary Simmons. Milton had not published work with the Simmons printing business for twenty years. Mary was increasingly relying on her son Samuel to help her manage the business and the first book that Samuel Simmons registered for publication in his name was \"Paradise Lost\" in 1667.\nStyle.\nBiblical epic.\nKey to the ambitions of \"Paradise Lost\" as a poem is the creation of a new kind of epic, one suitable for English, Christian morality rather than polytheistic Greek or Roman antiquity. This intention is indicated from the very beginning of the poem, when Milton uses the classical epic poetic device of an invocation for poetic inspiration. Rather than invoking the classical muses, however, Milton addresses the Christian God as his \"Heav'nly Muse\" (1.1). Other classical epic conventions include an \"in medias res\" opening, a journey in the underworld, large-scale battles, and an elevated poetic style. In particular, the poem often uses Homeric similes. Milton repurposes these epic conventions to create a new biblical epic, promoting a different kind of hero. Classical epic heroes like Achilles, Odysseus, and Aeneas were presented in the \"Iliad\", \"Odyssey\", and \"Aeneid\" as heroes for their military strength and guile, which might go hand in hand with wrath, pride, or lust. Milton attributes these traits instead to Satan, and depicts the Son as heroic for his love, mercy, humility, and self-sacrifice. The poem itself therefore presents the value system of classical heroism as one which has been superseded by Christian virtue.\nBlank verse.\nThe poem is written in blank verse, meaning the lines are metrically regular iambic pentameter but they do not rhyme. Milton used the flexibility of blank verse to support a high level of syntactic complexity. Although Milton was not the first to use blank verse, his use of it was very influential and he became known for the style. Blank verse was not much used in the non-dramatic poetry of the 17th century until \"Paradise Lost\". Milton also wrote \"Paradise Regained\" (1671) and parts of \"Samson Agonistes\" (1671) in blank verse. Miltonic blank verse became the standard for those attempting to write English epics for centuries following the publication of \"Paradise Lost\" and his later poetry.\nWhen Miltonic verse became popular, Samuel Johnson mocked Milton for inspiring bad blank verse imitators. Alexander Pope's final, incomplete work was intended to be written in the form, and John Keats, who complained that he relied too heavily on Milton, adopted and picked up various aspects of his poetry.\nAcrostics.\nMilton used a number of acrostics in the poem. In Book 9, a verse describing the serpent which tempted Eve to eat the forbidden fruit in the Garden of Eden spells out \"SATAN\" (9.510), while elsewhere in the same book, Milton spells out \"FFAALL\" and \"FALL\" (9.333). Respectively, these probably represent the double fall of humanity embodied in Adam and Eve, as well as Satan's fall from Heaven.\nCharacters.\nSatan.\nSatan, formerly called Lucifer, is the first major character introduced in the poem. He is a tragic figure who famously declares: \"Better to reign in Hell than serve in Heaven\" (1.263). Following his vain rebellion against God he is cast out from Heaven and condemned to Hell. The rebellion stems from Satan's pride and envy (5.660ff.).\nOpinions on the character are often sharply divided. Milton presents Satan as the origin of all evil, but some readers interpret Milton's Satan as a nuanced or sympathetic character. Romanticist critics in particular, among them William Blake, Lord Byron, Percy Bysshe Shelley, and William Hazlitt, are known for interpreting Satan as a hero of \"Paradise Lost\". This has led other critics, such as C. S. Lewis and Charles Williams, both of whom were devout Christians, to argue against reading Satan as a sympathetic, heroic figure. Despite Blake thinking that Milton intended for Satan to have a heroic role in the poem, Blake himself described Satan as the \"state of error\", and as beyond salvation.\nJohn Carey argues that this conflict cannot be solved, because the character of Satan exists in more modes and greater depth than the other characters of \"Paradise Lost\": in this way, Milton has created an ambivalent character, and any \"pro-Satan\" or \"anti-Satan\" argument is by its nature discarding half the evidence. Satan's ambivalence, Carey says, is \"a precondition of the poem's success\u00a0\u2013 a major factor in the attention it has aroused\".\nC. S. Lewis argues in his \"A Preface to Paradise Lost\" that it is important to remember what society was like when Milton wrote the poem. In particular, during that time period, there were certain \"stock responses\" to elements that Milton would have expected every reader to have. As examples, Lewis lists \"love is sweet, death bitter, virtue lovely, and children or gardens delightful.\" According to Lewis, Milton would have expected readers to not view Satan as a hero at all. Lewis argues readers far in the future romanticizing Milton's intentions is not accurate.\nComparative religion scholar R. J. Zwi Werblowsky argues in his \"Lucifer and Prometheus\" that Milton's Satan is a disproportionately appealing character because of attributes he shares with the Greek Titan Prometheus. It has been called \"most illuminating\" for its historical and typological perspective on Milton's Satan as embodying both positive and negative values. The book has also been significant in pointing out the essential ambiguity of Prometheus and his dual Christ-like/Satanic nature as developed in the Christian tradition. \nAdam.\nAdam is the first human created by God. Adam requests a companion from God: &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Of fellowship I speakSuch as I seek, fit to participateAll rational delight, wherein the bruteCannot be human consort. (8.389\u2013392) God approves his request then creates Eve. God appoints Adam and Eve to rule over all the creatures of the world and to reside in the Garden of Eden.\nAdam is more gregarious than Eve and yearns for her company. He is completely infatuated with her. Raphael advises him to \"take heed lest Passion sway / Thy Judgment\" (5.635\u2013636). But Adam's great love for Eve contributes to his disobedience to God.\nUnlike the biblical Adam, before Milton's Adam leaves Paradise he is given a glimpse of the future of mankind by the Archangel Michael, which includes stories from the Old and New Testaments.\nEve.\nEve is the second human created by God. God takes one of Adam's ribs and shapes it into Eve. Whether Eve is actually inferior to Adam is a vexed point. She is often unwilling to be submissive. Eve may be the more intelligent of the two. When she first met Adam she turned away, more interested in herself. She had been looking at her reflection in a lake before being led invisibly to Adam. Recounting this to Adam she confesses that she found him less enticing than her reflection (4.477\u2013480).\nEve delivers an autobiography in Book 4.\nIn Book 9, Milton stages a domestic drama between Adam and Eve, which results in Eve convincing Adam to separate for a time to work in different parts of the Garden. This allows Satan to deceive her while she is alone. To tempt her to eat the forbidden fruit, Satan tells a story about how he ate it, using the language of Renaissance love poetry. He overcomes her reason; she eats the fruit.\nThe Son of God.\nThe Son of God is the spirit who will become incarnate as Jesus Christ, though he is never named explicitly because he has not yet entered human form. Milton believed in a subordinationist doctrine of Christology that regarded the Son as secondary to the Father and as God's \"great Vice-regent\" (5.609).\nMilton's God in \"Paradise Lost\" refers to the Son as \"My word, my wisdom, and effectual might\" (3.170). The poem is not explicitly anti-trinitarian, but it is consistent with Milton's convictions. The Son is the ultimate hero of the epic and is infinitely powerful\u2014he single-handedly defeats Satan and his followers and drives them into Hell. After their fall, the Son of God tells Adam and Eve about God's judgment. Before their fall the Father foretells their \"Treason\" (3.207) and that Man\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;&lt;poem&gt;\nwith his whole posteritie must dye,\nDye hee or Justice must; unless for him\nSom other able, and as willing, pay\nThe rigid satisfaction, death for death. (3.210\u2013212)\n&lt;/poem&gt;\nThe Father then asks whether there \"Dwels in all Heaven charitie so deare?\" (3.216) and the Son volunteers himself.\nIn the final book a vision of Salvation through the Son is revealed to Adam by Michael. The name Jesus of Nazareth, and the details of Jesus' story are not depicted in the poem, though they are alluded to. Michael explains that \"Joshua, whom the Gentiles Jesus call\", prefigures the Son of God, \"his name and office bearing\" to \"quell / The adversarie Serpent, and bring back [...] long wander[e]d man / Safe to eternal Paradise of rest\".\nGod the Father.\nGod the Father is the creator of Heaven, Hell, the world, of everyone and everything there is, through the agency of His Son. Milton presents God as all-powerful and all-knowing, as an infinitely great being who cannot be overthrown by even the great army of angels Satan incites against him. Milton portrays God as often conversing about his plans and his motives for his actions with the Son of God. The poem shows God creating the world in the way Milton believed it was done, that is, God created Heaven, Earth, Hell, and all the creatures that inhabit these separate planes from part of Himself, not out of nothing. Thus, according to Milton, the ultimate authority of God over all things that happen derives from his being the \"author\" of all creation. Satan tries to justify his rebellion by denying this aspect of God and claiming self-creation, but he admits to himself the truth otherwise, and that God \"deserved no such return / From me, whom He created what I was\".\nRaphael.\nRaphael is an archangel who is sent by God to Eden in order to strengthen Adam and Eve against Satan. He tells a heroic tale about the War in Heaven that takes up most of Book 6 of \"Paradise Lost\". Ultimately, the story told by Raphael, in which Satan is portrayed as bold and decisive, does not prepare Adam and Eve to counter Satan's subtle temptations\u00a0\u2013 and may even have caused the Fall in the first place.\nMichael.\nMichael is an archangel who is preeminent in military prowess. He leads in battle and uses a sword which was \"giv'n him temperd so, that neither keen / Nor solid might resist that edge\" (6.322\u2013323).\nGod sends Michael to Eden, charging him:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;&lt;poem&gt;\nfrom the Paradise of God\nWithout remorse drive out the sinful Pair\nFrom hallowd ground th' unholie, and denounce\nTo them and to thir Progenie from thence\nPerpetual banishment. [...]\nIf patiently thy bidding they obey,\nDismiss them not disconsolate; reveale\nTo Adam what shall come in future dayes,\nAs I shall thee enlighten, intermix\nMy Cov'nant in the womans seed renewd;\nSo send them forth, though sorrowing, yet in peace. (11.103\u2013117)\n&lt;/poem&gt;\nHe is also charged with establishing a guard for Paradise.\nWhen Adam sees him coming he describes him to Eve as\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;&lt;poem&gt;\nnot terrible,\nThat I should fear, nor sociably mild,\nAs Raphael, that I should much confide,\nBut solemn and sublime, whom not to offend,\nWith reverence I must meet, and thou retire. (11.233\u2013237)\n&lt;/poem&gt;\nSin.\nSin is the first female character presented in the epic and is introduced in Book 2. She is described to have a monstrous serpentine form such as Homer\u2019s Scylla in \"The Odyssey\" and Edmund Spenser\u2019s Error in \"The Faerie Queene\". She is Satan\u2019s daughter and is born in Heaven through parthenogenesis (2.757-760). After the angels fall from Heaven, God charges Sin with the responsibility of guarding the gates of Hell (2.850-853). \nThemes.\nMarriage.\nMilton first presented Adam and Eve in Book IV with impartiality. The relationship between Adam and Eve is one of \"mutual dependence, not a relation of domination or hierarchy\". While the author placed Adam above Eve in his intellectual knowledge and, in turn, his relation to God, he granted Eve the benefit of knowledge through experience. Hermine Van Nuis clarifies, that although there was stringency specified for the roles of male and female, Adam and Eve unreservedly accept their designated roles. Rather than viewing these roles as forced upon them, each uses their assignment as an asset in their relationship with each other. These distinctions can be interpreted as Milton's view on the importance of mutuality between husband and wife.\nWhen examining the relationship between Adam and Eve, some critics apply either an Adam-centered or Eve-centered view of hierarchy and importance to God. David Mikics argues, by contrast, these positions \"overstate the independence of the characters' stances, and therefore miss the way in which Adam and Eve are entwined with each other\". Milton's narrative depicts a relationship where the husband and wife (here, Adam and Eve) depend on each other and, through each other's differences, thrive. Still, there are several instances where Adam communicates directly with God while Eve must go through Adam to God; thus, some have described Adam as her guide.\nAlthough Milton does not directly mention divorce, critics posit theories on Milton's view of divorce based upon their inferences from the poem and from his tracts on divorce written earlier in his life. Other works by Milton suggest he viewed marriage as an entity separate from the church. Discussing \"Paradise Lost\", Biberman entertains the idea that \"marriage is a contract made by both the man and the woman\". These ideas imply Milton may have thought that both man and woman should have equal access to marriage and to divorce.\nIdolatry.\nMilton's 17th-century contemporaries by and large criticised his ideas and considered him a radical, mostly because of his republican political views and heterodox theological opinions. One of Milton's most controversial arguments centred on his concept of what is idolatrous, a subject which is deeply embedded in \"Paradise Lost\".\nMilton's first criticism of idolatry focused on the constructing of temples and other buildings to serve as places of worship. In Book XI of \"Paradise Lost\", Adam tries to atone for his sins by offering to build altars to worship God. In response, the angel Michael explains that Adam does not need to build physical objects to experience the presence of God. Joseph Lyle points to this example, explaining: \"When Milton objects to architecture, it is not a quality inherent in buildings themselves he finds offensive, but rather their tendency to act as convenient loci to which idolatry, over time, will inevitably adhere.\" Even if the idea is pure in nature, Milton thought it would unavoidably lead to idolatry simply because of the nature of humans. That is, instead of directing their thoughts towards God, humans will turn to erected objects and falsely invest their faith there. While Adam attempts to build an altar to God, critics note Eve is similarly guilty of idolatry, but in a different manner. Harding believes Eve's narcissism and obsession with herself constitutes idolatry. Specifically, Harding claims that \"under the serpent's influence, Eve's idolatry and self-deification foreshadow the errors into which her 'Sons' will stray\". Much like Adam, Eve falsely places her faith in herself, the Tree of Knowledge, and to some extent the Serpent, all of which do not compare to the ideal nature of God.\nMilton made his views on idolatry more explicit with the creation of Pand\u00e6monium and his allusion to Solomon's temple. In the beginning of \"Paradise Lost\" and throughout the poem, there are several references to the rise and eventual fall of Solomon's temple. Critics elucidate that \"Solomon's temple provides an explicit demonstration of how an artefact moves from its genesis in devotional practice to an idolatrous end.\" This example, out of the many presented, distinctly conveys Milton's views on the dangers of idolatry. Even if one builds a structure in the name of God, the best of intentions can become immoral in idolatry. The majority of these similarities revolve around a structural likeness, but as Lyle explains, they play a greater role. By linking Saint Peter's Basilica and the Pantheon to Pandemonium\u2014an ideally false structure\u2014the two famous buildings take on a false meaning. This comparison best represents Milton's Protestant views, as it rejects both the purely Catholic perspective and the Pagan perspective.\nIn addition to rejecting Catholicism, Milton revolted against the idea of a monarch ruling by divine right. He saw the practice as idolatrous. Barbara Lewalski concludes that the theme of idolatry in \"Paradise Lost\" \"is an exaggerated version of the idolatry Milton had long associated with the Stuart ideology of divine kingship\". In the opinion of Milton, any object, human or non-human, that receives special attention befitting of God, is considered idolatrous.\nCriticism of monarchy.\nAlthough Satan's army inevitably loses the war against God, Satan achieves a position of power and begins his reign in Hell with his band of loyal followers, composed of fallen angels, which is described to be a \"third of heaven\". Similar to Milton's republican sentiments of overthrowing the King of England for both better representation and parliamentary power, Satan argues that his shared rebellion with the fallen angels is an effort to \"explain the hypocrisy of God\", and in doing so, they will be treated with the respect and acknowledgement that they deserve. As Wayne Rebhorn argues, \"Satan insists that he and his fellow revolutionaries held their places by right and even leading him to claim that they were self-created and self-sustained\" and thus Satan's position in the rebellion is much like that of his own real-world creator.\nMilton scholar John Leonard interpreted the \"impious war\" between Heaven and Hell as civil war:\n\"Paradise Lost\" is, among other things, a poem about civil war. Satan raises \"impious war in Heav'n\" (i\u00a043) by leading a third of the angels in revolt against God. The term \"impious war\" implies that civil war is impious. But Milton applauded the English people for having the courage to depose and execute King Charles\u00a0I. In his poem, however, he takes the side of \"Heav'n's awful Monarch\" (iv\u00a0960). Critics have long wrestled with the question of why an antimonarchist and defender of regicide should have chosen a subject that obliged him to defend monarchical authority.\nThe editors at the Poetry Foundation argue that Milton's criticism of the English monarchy was being directed specifically at the Stuart monarchy and not at the monarchical system of government in general.\nIn a similar vein, C. S. Lewis argued that there was no contradiction in Milton's position in the poem since \"Milton believed that God was his 'natural superior' and that Charles Stuart was not.\"\nMoral ambiguity.\nThe critic William Empson claimed the poem was morally ambiguous, with Milton's complex characterization of Satan playing a large part in Empson's claim of moral ambiguity. For context, the second volume of Empson's authorized biography was titled: \"William Empson: Against the Christians\". In it his authorized biographer describes \"Empson's visceral loathing of Christianity.\" He spent a large amount of his career attacking Christianity, demonizing it as \"wickedness\" and claiming that Milton's God was \"sickeningly bad.\" For example, Empson portrays Milton's God as akin to a \"Stalinist\" tyrant \"who enslaves His human creations to serve His own narcissism.\"\nFrom there, Empson gives fake praise that is really an attack, saying that \"Milton deserves credit for making God wicked, since the God of Christianity is 'a wicked God'.\" John Leonard states that \"Empson never denies that Satan's plan is wicked. What he does deny is that God is innocent of its wickedness: 'Milton steadily drives home that the inmost counsel of God was the Fortunate Fall of man; however wicked Satan's plan may be, it is God's plan too [since God in \"Paradise Lost\" is depicted as being both omniscient and omnipotent].'\" Leonard notes that this interpretation was challenged by Dennis Danielson in his book \"Milton's Good God\" (1982).\nAlexandra Kapelos-Peters explains that: \"as Danielson logically asserts, foreknowledge is not commensurate with culpability. Although God knew that Adam and Eve would eat the forbidden fruit of knowledge, He neither commanded them to do so, nor influenced their decision.\" Moreover, God gives humans free will to choose to do good or evil, while a tyrant would do the very opposite and deny free will by controlling his subjects' actions like a puppet-master. She says Danielson and Milton \"demonstrate one crucial point: the presence of sin in the world is attributable to human agency and free will. Danielson argues that free will is crucial, because without it humanity would have only been serving necessity, and not participating in a free love act with the divine.\" She notes that in \"Paradise Lost\", God says: \"They trespass, Authors to themselves in all, Both what they judge and what they choose; for so I formd them free, and free they must remain.\"\nKapelos-Peters adds: \"Milton demonstrates that far from being a tyrannical lord, God and the Son function as a collaborative team that desire nothing but the return of man to his pre-fallen state. Furthermore, God is not even able to dominate in this aspect because human agency and free-will are not abandoned. Not only will the Son sacrifice himself pre-emptively in Book 3 for the not-yet-occurred Fall of Man, but Man himself will have a role in his own salvation. To successfully navigate atonement, humanity will have to admit and repent of their former disobedience.\"\nC. S. Lewis also rebutted the approach of people like Empson. Lewis wrote: \"The first qualification for judging any piece of workmanship from a corkscrew to a cathedral is to know \"what\" it is\u00a0\u2013 what it was intended to do and how it is meant to be used.\" Lewis said the poem was a genuine Christian morality tale. In Lewis's book \"A Preface to Paradise Lost\", he discusses the theological similarities between \"Paradise Lost\" and St. Augustine, and says that \"The Fall is simply and solely Disobedience\u00a0\u2013 doing what you have been told not to do: and it results from Pride\u00a0\u2013 from being too big for your boots, forgetting your place, thinking that you are God.\"\nInterpretation and critique.\nEighteenth-century critics.\nThe writer and critic Samuel Johnson wrote that \"Paradise Lost\" shows off Milton's \"peculiar power to astonish\" and that Milton \"seems to have been well acquainted with his own genius, and to know what it was that Nature had bestowed upon him more bountifully than upon others: the power of displaying the vast, illuminating the splendid, enforcing the awful, darkening the gloomy, and aggravating the dreadful\".\nWilliam Blake famously wrote in \"The Marriage of Heaven and Hell\": \"The reason Milton wrote in fetters when he wrote of Angels &amp; God, and at liberty when of Devils &amp; Hell, is because he was a true Poet and of the Devil's party without knowing it.\" This quotation succinctly represents the way in which some 18th- and 19th-century English Romantic poets viewed Milton.\nChristian epic.\nTobias Gregory wrote that Milton was \"the most theologically learned among early modern epic poets. He was, moreover, a theologian of great independence of mind, and one who developed his talents within a society where the problem of divine justice was debated with particular intensity.\" Gregory says that Milton is able to establish divine action and his divine characters in a superior way to other Renaissance epic poets, including Ludovico Ariosto or Torquato Tasso.\nIn \"Paradise Lost\" Milton also ignores the traditional epic format of a plot based on a mortal conflict between opposing armies with deities watching over and occasionally interfering with the action. Instead, both divinity and humanity are involved in a conflict that, while momentarily ending in tragedy, offers a future salvation. In both \"Paradise Lost\" and \"Paradise Regained\", Milton incorporates aspects of Lucan's epic model, the epic from the view of the defeated. Although he does not accept the model completely within \"Paradise Regained\", he incorporates the \"anti-Virgilian, anti-imperial epic tradition of Lucan\". Milton goes further than Lucan in this belief and \"\"Paradise Lost\" and \"Paradise Regained\" carry further, too, the movement toward and valorization of romance that Lucan's tradition had begun, to the point where Milton's poems effectively create their own new genre\".\nThe Catholic Church reacted by banning the poem and placing it on the Index Librorum Prohibitorum.\nIconography.\nThe first illustrations to accompany the text of \"Paradise Lost\" were added to the fourth edition of 1688, with one engraving prefacing each book, of which up to eight of the twelve were by Sir John Baptist Medina, one by Bernard Lens\u00a0II, and perhaps up to four (including Books\u00a0I and XII, perhaps the most memorable) by another hand. The engraver was Michael Burghers (given as 'Burgesse' in some sources). By 1730, the same images had been re-engraved on a smaller scale by Paul Fourdrinier.\nSome of the most notable illustrators of \"Paradise Lost\" included William Blake, Gustave Dor\u00e9, and Henry Fuseli. However, the epic's illustrators also include John Martin, Edward Francis Burney, Richard Westall, Francis Hayman, and many others.\nOutside of book illustrations, the epic has also inspired other visual works by well-known painters like Salvador Dal\u00ed who executed a set of ten colour engravings in 1974. Milton's achievement in writing \"Paradise Lost\" while blind (he dictated to helpers) inspired loosely biographical paintings by both Fuseli and Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix.\nTranslations.\nTamil.\nBook 1 of \"Paradise Lost\" was translated into Tamil under the title \"Swarga Neekam\" \"MutharKandam\" (1895) by V. P. Subramania Mudaliar (1857-1946). The translator included annotations and a biography of Milton in the translation.\"\"\nAnother translation titled \"I\u1e3banta corkkam: K\u0101viyam\" was published on 2020 by H. Mujeeb Rahman as an Amazon Kindle edition.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Its first flight was on March 29, 1996. The Department of Defense terminated DarkStar in January 1999, after determining the UAV was not aerodynamically stable and was not meeting cost and performance objectives.\nDesign and development.\nThe RQ-3 DarkStar was designed as a \"high-altitude endurance UAV\", and incorporated stealth aircraft technology to make it difficult to detect, which allowed it to operate within heavily defended airspace, unlike the Northrop Grumman RQ-4 Global Hawk, which is unable to operate except under conditions of air supremacy. The DarkStar was fully autonomous: it could take off, fly to its target, operate its sensors, transmit information, return and land without human intervention. Human operators, however, could change the DarkStar's flight plan and sensor orientation through radio or satellite relay. The RQ-3 carried either an optical sensor or radar, and could send digital information to a satellite while still in flight. It used a single airbreathing jet engine of unknown type for propulsion. One source claims it used a Williams-Rolls-Royce FJ44-1A turbofan engine.\nThe first prototype made its first flight on March 29, 1996, but its second flight, on April 22, 1996, ended in a crash shortly after takeoff. A modified, more stable design (the RQ-3A) first flew on June 29, 1998, and made a total of five flights before the program was canceled just prior to the sixth and final flight planned for the airworthiness test phase. Two additional RQ-3As were built, but never made any flights before program cancellation.\nThe \"R\" is the Department of Defense designation for reconnaissance; \"Q\" means unmanned aircraft system.

{"id": "37375", "revid": "1934512", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37375", "title": "Northrop Grumman RQ-4 Global Hawk", "text": "Unmanned surveillance aircraft\nThe Northrop Grumman RQ-4 Global Hawk is a high-altitude, remotely-piloted surveillance aircraft introduced in 2001. It was initially designed by Ryan Aeronautical (now part of Northrop Grumman), and known as Tier II+ during development. The RQ-4 provides a broad overview and systematic surveillance using high-resolution synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and electro-optical/infrared (EO/IR) sensors with long loiter times over target areas.\nThe Global Hawk is operated by the United States Air Force (USAF). It is used as a high-altitude long endurance (HALE) platform covering the spectrum of intelligence collection capability to support forces in worldwide military operations. According to the USAF, the superior surveillance capabilities of the aircraft allow more precise weapons targeting and better protection of friendly forces.\nCost overruns led to the original plan to acquire 63 aircraft being cut to 45, and to a 2013 proposal to mothball the 21 Block 30 signals intelligence variants. The initial flyaway cost of each of the first 10 aircraft was US$10 million in 1994. By 2001, this had risen to US$60.9 million (~$ in 2024), and then to $131.4 million (flyaway cost) in 2013. The U.S. Navy has developed the Global Hawk into the MQ-4C Triton maritime surveillance platform. As of 2022[ [update]], the U.S. Air Force plans to retire its Global Hawks in 2027.\nDevelopment.\nOrigins.\nIn the 1990s, the Air Force was developing uncrewed aerial intelligence platforms. One was the stealthy Lockheed Martin RQ-3 DarkStar; another was the Global Hawk. Due to budget cuts, only one of the programs could survive. It was decided to proceed with the Global Hawk for its range and payload rather than go with the stealth Dark Star.\nThe Global Hawk took its first flight on 28 February 1998, at Edwards Air Force Base, California. The first seven aircraft were built under the Advanced Concept Technology Demonstration (ACTD) program, sponsored by DARPA, in order to evaluate the design and demonstrate its capabilities. Demand for the RQ-4's abilities was high in the Middle East; thus, the prototype aircraft were actively operated by the USAF in the War in Afghanistan. In an unusual move, the aircraft entered initial low-rate production while still in engineering and manufacturing development. Nine production Block 10 aircraft, sometimes referred to as RQ-4A, were produced; of these, two were sold to the US Navy and an additional two were deployed to Iraq to support operations there. The final Block 10 aircraft was delivered on 26 June 2006.\nTo increase the aircraft's capabilities, the airframe was redesigned, with the nose section and wings being stretched. The modified aircraft, designated RQ-4B Block 20, can carry up to 3,000\u00a0lb (1,360\u00a0kg) of internal payload. These changes were introduced with the first Block 20 aircraft, the 17th Global Hawk produced, which was rolled out in a ceremony on 25 August 2006. First flight of the Block 20 from the USAF Plant 42 in Palmdale, California to Edwards Air Force Base took place on 1 March 2007. Developmental testing of Block 20 took place in 2008.\nUnited States Navy version.\nThe United States Navy took delivery of two of the Block 10 aircraft to evaluate their maritime surveillance capabilities, designated N-1 (BuNo 166509) and N-2 (BuNo 166510). The initial navalised example was tested at Edwards Air Force Base briefly, before moving to Naval Air Station Patuxent River in March 2006 for the Global Hawk Maritime Demonstration (GHMD) program, operated by Navy squadron VX-20.\nIn July 2006, the GHMD aircraft flew in the Rim of the Pacific (RIMPAC exercise) for the first time. Although it was in the vicinity of Hawaii, the aircraft was operated from NBVC Point Mugu, requiring flights of approximately each way to the area. Four flights were performed, resulting in over 24 hours of persistent maritime surveillance coordinated with the aircraft carrier and amphibious warfare ship . For the GHMD program, the Global Hawk was tasked with maintaining maritime situational awareness, contact tracking, and imagery support of exercise operations. Images were transmitted to NAS Patuxent River for processing and then forwarded to the fleet off Hawaii.\nNorthrop Grumman entered an RQ-4B variant in the US Navy's Broad Area Maritime Surveillance (BAMS) UAV competition. On 22 April 2008, it was announced that Northrop Grumman's \"RQ-4N\" had won and that the Navy had awarded a US$1.16 billion (~$ in 2024) contract. In September 2010, the RQ-4N was officially designated the \"MQ-4C\".\nThe Navy MQ-4C differs from the Air Force RQ-4 mainly in its wing. While the Global Hawk remains at high altitude to conduct surveillance, the Triton climbs to to see a wide area and can drop to to get further identification of a target. The Triton's wings are specially designed to take the stresses of rapidly decreasing altitude. Though similar in appearance to the Global Hawk's wings, the Triton's internal wing structure is much stronger and has additional features including anti-icing capabilities and impact and lightning strike protection.\nOn 17 June 2022, the Navy brought its last deployed RQ-4A BAMS-D back from the Middle East, ending what started as a six-month experiment but turned into a 13-year deployment. The Navy had acquired five Block 10 RQ-4As and since 2009 at least one had been kept on rotation in the Persian Gulf region. The aircraft accrued over 42,500 flight hours in 2,069 missions; one was lost in an accident and another was shot down by Iran. The BAMS-D was replaced in Navy service with the MQ-4C.\nCost increases and procurement.\nDevelopment cost overruns placed the Global Hawk at risk of cancellation. In mid-2006, per-unit costs were 25% over baseline estimates, caused by both the need to correct design deficiencies as well as to increase its capabilities. This caused concern over a possible congressional termination of the program if its national security benefits could not be justified. However, in June 2006, the program was restructured. Completion of an operational assessment report by the USAF was delayed from 2005 to 2007 due to manufacturing and development delays. The operational assessment report was released in March 2007 and production of the 54 air vehicles planned was extended by two years to 2015.\nIn February 2011, the USAF reduced its planned purchase of RQ-4 Block 40 aircraft from 22 to 11 in order to cut costs. In June 2011, the U.S. Defense Department's Director, Operational Test and Evaluation (DOT&amp;E) found the RQ-4B \"not operationally effective\" due to reliability issues. In June 2011, the Global Hawk was certified by the Secretary of Defense as critical to national security following a breach of the Nunn-McCurdy Amendment; the Secretary stated: \"The Global Hawk is essential to national security; there are no alternatives to Global Hawk which provide acceptable capability at less cost; Global Hawk costs $220M less per year than the Lockheed U-2 to operate on a comparable mission; the U-2 cannot simultaneously carry the same sensors as the Global Hawk; and if funding must be reduced, Global Hawk has a higher priority over other programs.\"\nOn 26 January 2012, the Pentagon announced plans to end Global Hawk Block 30 procurement as the type was found to be more expensive to operate and with less capable sensors than the existing U-2. Plans to increase procurement of the Block 40 variant were also announced. The Air Force's fiscal year 2013 budget request said it had resolved to divest itself of the Block 30 variant; however, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2013 mandated operations of the Block 30 fleet through the end of 2014. The USAF plans to procure 45 RQ-4B Global Hawks as of 2013. Before retiring in 2014, ACC commander, General Mike Hostage said of the U-2's replacement by the drone that \"The combatant commanders are going to suffer for eight years and the best they're going to get is 90 percent\".\nDuring 2010\u20132013, costs of flying the RQ-4 fell by more than 50%. In 2010, the cost per flight hour was $40,600, with contractor logistic support making up $25,000 per flight hour of this figure. By mid-2013, cost per flight hour dropped to $18,900, contractor logistic support having dropped to $11,000 per flight hour. This was in part due to higher usage, spreading logistics and support costs over a higher number of flight hours. In 2015, the RQ-4 was planned to replace the U-2 by 2019, though Lockheed Martin stated the U-2 can remain viable until 2050. As of January 2018, the U.S. Air Force budget for 2018 had indefinitely postponed the retirement of the U-2. In February 2020, the U.S. Air Force submitted budget documents with confusing language suggesting that it could begin retiring U-2s in 2025 but clarified afterwards that no retirement is planned. \nIn July 2022, the US Air Force announced plans to retire the Global Hawk in 2027.\nEuroHawk.\nThe German Air Force (\"Luftwaffe\") ordered a variant of the RQ-4B, to be equipped with a customized sensor suite, designated \"EuroHawk\". The aircraft was based on the RQ-4B Block 20/30/40 and was to be equipped with an EADS-built signals intelligence (SIGINT) package; it was intended to fulfill Germany's requirement to replace their aging Dassault-Breguet Atlantique electronic surveillance aircraft of the \"Marineflieger\" (Naval Air arm of the German Navy). The EADS sensor package is composed of six wing-mounted pods; reportedly these sensor pods could potentially be used on other platforms, including crewed aircraft.\nThe EuroHawk was officially rolled out on 8 October 2009 and its first flight took place on 29 June 2010. It underwent several months of flight testing at Edwards Air Force Base. On 21 July 2011, the first EuroHawk arrived in Manching, Germany; after which it was scheduled to receive its SIGINT sensor package and undergo further testing and pilot training until the first quarter of 2012. The Luftwaffe planned to station the type with \"Taktisches Luftwaffengeschwader 51\" (\"Reconnaissance wing 51\"). In 2011 the German Ministry of Defence was aware of difficulties with the certification for use within the European airspace. During flight trials, problems with the EuroHawk's flight control system were found; the German certification process was also complicated by Northrop Grumman refusing to share technical data on the aircraft with which to perform evaluations.\nOn 13 May 2013, German media reported that the EuroHawk would not be certifiable under ICAO rules without an anti-collision system; thus preventing any operations within European airspace or the airspace of any ICAO member. The additional cost of certification was reported to be more than \u20ac600 million (US$780 million). On 15 May 2013, the German government announced the immediate termination of the program, attributing the cancellation to the certification issue. Reportedly, the additional cost to develop the EuroHawk to the standards needed for certification may not have guaranteed final approval for certification.\nGerman defense minister Thomas de Maizi\u00e8re stated EuroHawk was \"very important\" for Germany in 2012, then referred to the project as being \"a horror without end\" in his 2013 statement to the Bundestag. The total cost of the project before it was canceled was \u20ac562 million. Northrop Grumman and EADS have described reports of flight control problems and high costs for certification as \"inaccurate\"; they have stated their intention to provide an affordable plan to complete the first EuroHawk's flight testing and produce the remaining four aircraft.\nOn 8 August 2013, the EuroHawk set an endurance record by flying continuously in European airspace for 25.3 hours, reaching an altitude of . It was the longest flight by an unrefueled UAS weighing more than in European skies. On 5 October 2014, German Minister of Defence Ursula von der Leyen was reportedly considering reactivating the EuroHawk program to test its reconnaissance abilities over a long period at altitudes of up to . Attempting to test the recon system on Airbus aircraft and an Israeli drone as alternate platforms had proven unsuccessful.\nThe Bundeswehr would use it to detect, decrypt, and potentially interfere with enemy communications signals. If tests prove successful, a carrier would be purchased, likely \"similar\" to the U.S. Global Hawk. Germany is considering installing the EuroHawk's SIGINT payloads onto the U.S. Navy MQ-4C Triton Global Hawk derivative, as the electronic and communications intelligence sensors would be more difficult to place on other substitute aircraft. It already has icing and lightning-strike protection, and was built with certification over civilian airspace in mind, meeting the STANAG 4671 requirements that had ended the EuroHawk program.\nAs of March 2021, Germany plans to put the single RQ-4E aircraft on display in the Bundeswehr Military History Museum by 2022.\nUniversal Payload Adapter and new payloads.\nIn January 2014, President Obama signed a budget that included a $10 million (~$ in 2024) study on adapting the U-2's superior sensors for the RQ-4. In April 2015, Northrop Grumman reportedly installed the U-2's Optical Bar Camera (OBC) and Senior Year Electro-Optical Reconnaissance System (SYERS-2B/C) sensors onto the RQ-4 using a Universal Payload Adapter (UPA). Successful testing indicated that all RQ-4s could be similarly retrofitted.\nOn 14 July 2015, Northrop Grumman and the USAF signed an agreement to demonstrate an RQ-4B fitted with the U-2's OBC and SYERS-2C sensors. Two Global Hawks are to be fitted with the UPA, involving the installation of 17 payload adapter fixtures and a new payload bay cover, as well as software and mission system changes for each sensor. The UPA can support of sensors and will create a canoe-shaped sensor bay on the fuselage's underside.\nNorthrop Grumman also expects to receive a contract to integrate the UTC Aerospace Systems MS-177 multispectral sensor used on the Northrop Grumman E-8C JSTARS onto the RQ-4. The MS-177 will replace the SYERS-2 and includes modernized optronics and a gimbaled rotation device to increase field of view by 20 percent. The RQ-4B flew with the SYERS-2 on 18 February 2016.\nRaytheon developed the AN/ALR-89 self-protection suite consisting of the AN/AVR-3 laser warning receiver, AN/APR-49 radar warning receiver, and jamming system, along with the ALE-50 towed decoy for the Global Hawk.\nRange Hawk.\nAlthough the Global Hawk is being retired from combat use, the Department of Defense's Test Resource Management Center (TRMC) is acquiring them to support the SkyRange program to test hypersonic missiles by 2024. Tests are currently monitored by ships, but it can take a ship 21 days to be positioned and outfitted for use, limiting flights to about a dozen airborne demonstrations a year. By using unmanned aircraft to track hypersonic systems, faster availability and deployment could support a test rate of up to one per week. To perform this new mission, the Global Hawk is retrofitted into the Range Hawk, which involves configuring it to look up rather than down by repositioning onboard avionics and installing new sensors and instrumentation suites to track an overhead hypersonic vehicle. The program will use four Block 20 and twenty Block 30 airframes retired from USAF service. Converted Block 10 Range Hawks supported 10 hypersonic flight tests in 2023, including two tests in spring 2023 over the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans taking place only 10 days apart.\nDesign.\nOverview.\nThe Global Hawk UAV system comprises the RQ-4 air vehicle, which is outfitted with various equipment such as sensor packages and communication systems; and a ground element consisting of a Launch and Recovery Element (LRE), and a Mission Control Element (MCE) with ground communications equipment. Each RQ-4 air vehicle is powered by an Allison Rolls-Royce AE3007H turbofan engine with thrust, and carries a payload of . The fuselage uses aluminum, semi-monocoque construction with a V-tail; the wings are made of composite materials.\nThere have been several iterations of the Global Hawk with different features and capabilities. The first version to be used operationally was the RQ-4A Block 10, which performed imagery intelligence (IMINT) with a payload of a synthetic aperture radar (SAR) with electro-optical (EO) and infrared (IR) sensors. Seven A-model Block 10s were delivered and all were retired by 2011. The RQ-4B Block 20 was the first of the B-model Global Hawks, which has a greater payload and employs upgraded SAR and EO/IR sensors. Four Block 20s were converted into communications relays with the Battlefield Airborne Communications Node (BACN) payload.\nThe RQ-4B Block 30 is capable of multi-intelligence (multi-INT) collecting with SAR and EO/IR sensors along with the Airborne Signals Intelligence Payload (ASIP), a wide-spectrum SIGINT sensor. The RQ-4B Block 40 is equipped with the multi-platform radar technology insertion program (MP-RTIP) active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar, which provides SAR and moving target indication (MTI) data for wide-area surveillance of stationary and moving targets. \nThe RQ-4 is capable of conducting sorties lasting up to 30 hours long and scheduled maintenance must be performed sooner than on other aircraft with less endurance. However, since it flies at higher altitudes than normal aircraft, it experiences less wear during flight. It can survey as much as of terrain per day, an area the size of South Korea or Iceland.\nSystem and ground facilities.\nRaytheon's Integrated Sensor Suite (ISS) consists of the following sensors:\nEither the EO or the IR sensors can operate simultaneously with the SAR. Each sensor provides wide area search imagery and a high-resolution spot mode. The SAR has a ground moving target indicator (GMTI) mode, which can provide a text message providing the moving target's position and velocity. Both SAR and EO/IR imagery are transmitted from the aircraft to the MCE as individual frames, and reassembled during ground processing. An onboard inertial navigation system, supplemented by Global Positioning System updates, comprises the navigational suite.\nThe Global Hawk's camera is capable of identifying objects on the ground as small as in diameter from in the air.\nThe Global Hawk is capable of operating autonomously and \"untethered\". A military satellite system (X Band Satellite Communication) is used for sending data from the aircraft to the MCE. The common data link can also be used for direct down link of imagery when the UAV is within line-of-sight of compatible ground stations. For dense flight areas the autonomous navigation is switched off and the RQ-4 is remote controlled via the satellite link by pilots on the ground who are supplied with the same instrument data and who carry the same responsibilities as pilots in crewed planes.\nThe ground segment consists of a Mission Control Element (MCE) and Launch and Recovery Element (LRE), provided by Raytheon. The MCE is used for mission planning, command and control, and image processing and dissemination; an LRE for controlling launch and recovery; and associated ground support equipment. The LRE provides precision Differential GPS corrections for navigational accuracy during takeoff and landings, while precision coded GPS supplemented with an inertial navigation system is used during mission execution. By having separable elements in the ground segment, the MCE and the LRE can operate in geographically separate locations, and the MCE can be deployed with the supported command's primary exploitation site. Both ground segments are contained in military shelters with external antennas for line-of-sight and satellite communications with the air vehicles.\nSensor packages.\nRadar.\nThe Global Hawk carries the Hughes Integrated Surveillance &amp; Reconnaissance (HISAR) sensor system. HISAR is a lower-cost derivative of the ASARS-2 package that Hughes developed for the U-2. It is also fitted to the US Army's de Havilland Canada RC-7B Airborne Reconnaissance Low Multifunction (ARLM) crewed aircraft, and is being sold on the international market. HISAR integrates a SAR-MTI system, along with an optical and a thermography imager.\nAll three sensors are controlled and their outputs filtered by a common processor and transmitted in real time at up to 50\u00a0Mbit/s to a ground station. The SAR-MTI system operates in the X band in various operational modes; such as the wide-area MTI mode with a radius of , combined SAR-MTI strip mode provides resolution over wide sections, and a SAR spot mode providing resolution over .\nIn July 2006, the USAF began testing the Global Hawk Block 30 upgrades in the Benefield Anechoic Facility at Edwards AFB. Upgrades include the Advanced Signals Intelligence Payload, an extremely sensitive SIGINT processor. and a specialist AESA radar system, the Multi-Platform Radar Technology Insertion Program, or MP-RTIP. In 2010, Northrop disclosed the sensor capabilities of the new Block 40 aircraft, including the MP-RTIP radar, emphasising surveillance over reconnaissance.\nOn 14 April 2014, a Block 40 Global Hawk completed the first Maritime Modes program risk-reduction flight to enhance the Air Force's maritime surveillance capabilities. Maritime Modes is made up of a Maritime Moving Target Indicator and a Maritime Inverse synthetic aperture radar (MISAR) that function together to provide ISR information on vessels traveling on the water's surface. During the 11.5-hour flight off of the California coast, the MISAR collected data on over 100 items of interest. Maritime Modes is planned to be integrated with the RQ-4B's existing MP-RTIP radar to detect and produce synthetic aperture radar imagery of ground vehicles.\nIn November 2015, Northrop Grumman selected the Garmin International GSX 70 weather radar to be installed on Air Force Global Hawks. The GSX 70 is designed to provide operators with real-time weather information, offering horizontal scan angles of up to 120 degrees for better visibility into the strength and intensity of convective activity and a vertical scanning mode to analyze storm tops, gradients, and cell buildup activity. It also has a Turbulence Detection feature to identify turbulence in air containing precipitation and other airborne particulates and Ground Clutter Suppression that removes ground returns from the display so operators can focus on weather. Installation is expected to begin in early 2016. Installation of weather radars on the Global Hawk fleet completed in late 2019.\nVisible light/infrared.\nThe visible and infrared imagers share the same gimballed sensor package, and use common optics, providing a telescopic close-up capability. It can be optionally fitted with an auxiliary SIGINT package.\nOperational history.\nU.S. Air Force.\nFollowing the September 11th attacks, the normal acquisition process was bypassed almost immediately and early developmental Global Hawk models were employed in overseas contingency operations beginning in November 2001. Global Hawk ACTD prototypes were used in the War in Afghanistan and in the Iraq War. Since April 2010, they fly the Northern Route, from Beale Air Force Base over Canada to South-East Asia and back, reducing flight time and improving maintenance. While their data-collection capabilities have been praised, the program lost four prototype aircraft out of six or seven to accidents.\nThe crashes were reported to be due to \"technical failures or poor maintenance\", with a failure rate per hour flown over 100 times higher than the F-16 fighter. Northrop Grumman stated that it was unfair to compare the failure rates of a mature design to that of a prototype aircraft. In June 2012, a media report described the Global Hawk, the General Atomics MQ-1 Predator and the MQ-9 Reapers \"...\u00a0the most accident-prone aircraft in the Air Force fleet.\" On 11 February 2010, the Global Hawks deployed in the Central Command AOR accrued 30,000 combat hours and 1,500 plus sorties.\nInitial operational capability was declared for the RQ-4 Block 30 in August 2011. The USAF did not plan to keep the RQ-4B Block 30 in service past 2014 due to the U-2 and other platforms being less expensive in the role. Congress sought to keep it in service until December 2016. The USAF had 18 RQ-4 Block 30s by the time of the passage of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2013, which directed a further three RQ-4s to be procured as part of Lot 11. The USAF felt that additional aircraft were \"excess to need\" and likely become backup or attrition reserve models.\nDespite the potential retirement of the Block 30 fleet due to low reliability, low mission readiness, and high costs, the USAF released a pre-solicitation notice in September 2013 for Lot 12 aircraft. In planning the USAF's FY 2015 budget, the Pentagon reversed its previous decision, shifting $3 billion from the U-2 to the RQ-4 Block 30, which had become more competitive with the U-2 due to increased flying hours. Factors such as cost per flight hour (CPFH), information gathering rates, mission readiness, adverse weather operational capability, distance to targets, and onboard power still favored the U-2.\nAfter the 2011 T\u014dhoku earthquake and tsunami, RQ-4s flew 300 hours over the affected areas in Japan. There were also plans to survey the No. 4 reactor at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant.\nBy November 2012, Northrop Grumman had delivered 37 Global Hawks to the USAF. By March 2014, 42 Global Hawks were in use around the world, with 32 in use by the USAF.\nThe USAF stated that U-2 pilot and altitude advantages allow better functionality in the stormy weather and airspace restrictions of the East Asia region and its altitude and sensor advantages allow it to see further into hostile territory. In October 2013, the U.S. secured basing rights to deploy RQ-4s from Japan, the first time that basing rights for the type had been secured in Northeast Asia. RQ-4s are stationed at Andersen Air Force Base in Guam, but bad weather often curtailed flights. Basing in Japan as opposed to Guam enhances spying capabilities against North Korea by eliminating range as a factor.\nTwo RQ-4s moved from Anderson AFB to Misawa Air Base in mid-2014 in the type's first deployment to Japan. They were speculated to have focused on maritime patrol missions. The two RQ-4s successfully performed their missions from Misawa AB during a six-month deployment, with none cancelled due to poor weather. It was the first time that they had operated out of a civil-military airport, sharing airspace and runways with commercial aircraft safely without additional restrictions, usually taking off and landing during quieter periods of air traffic. Officials only stated that they had operated at \"various places around the Pacific.\"\nOn 19 September 2013, the RQ-4 Block 40 Global Hawk conducted its first wartime flight from Grand Forks Air Force Base.\nIn November 2013, an USAF RQ-4 deployed to the Philippines after Typhoon Haiyan to assist in relief efforts. It flew from Andersen Air Force Base in Guam to relay imagery of afflicted areas to response personnel and ground commanders.\nIn planning for the FY 2015 budget, the U-2 was to be retired in favor of the RQ-4, made possible by reductions of RQ-4 operating costs and would be the first time an uncrewed aircraft would completely replace a crewed aircraft. The U-2 will continue to fly through 2018 without replacement.\nIn May 2014, a U.S. Global Hawk conducted a surveillance mission over Nigeria as part of the search for the kidnapped Nigerian schoolgirls. The Global Hawk joined MC-12 crewed aircraft in the search.\nThe Global Hawk was used in Operation Inherent Resolve (OIR) against the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL). The aircraft provided real-time imagery and signals intelligence to identify friendly and enemy forces, do long-term target development, and track enemy equipment movement, enabling combatant commanders to act on better information and make key decisions. The BACN version allowed ground troops to contact aircraft when they were in need of assistance, such as close air support.\nOn 11 November 2015, an EQ-4 became the first Global Hawk aircraft to reach 500 sorties. All three EQ-4s in operation supported OIR. Upon landing, maintainers could complete ground maintenance and make the aircraft mission ready again within five hours. Missions could last up to 30 hours, with each aircraft getting a \"day off\" in between combat flights. On 1 April 2017, the EQ-4 program completed 1,000 continuous sorties, without incurring a single maintenance cancellation, while supporting OIR.\nOn 4 April 2016, it was reported that a USAF Global Hawk had completed its third flight over Germany under an initiative (the European Reassurance Initiative) to reassure NATO members concerned over the Russo-Ukrainian war. Germany opened its airspace for up to five Global Hawk flights a month until the middle of October 2016. The Naval Air Station Sigonella, Sicily-based Global Hawk flies over Italian and French airspace and an air corridor through Germany with its sensors switched off on its way to its area of operations over the Baltic Sea.\nIn 2017, the USAF decided to begin the process of training enlisted airmen to fly the RQ-4 due to a shortage of pilots and an increased demand for the Global Hawk's capabilities. The RQ-4 is currently the only aircraft enlisted pilots are flying.\nOn 16 August 2018, a Global Hawk, assigned to 12th Reconnaissance Squadron, took off from Beale AFB, California, and landed at Eielson Air Force Base, Alaska for Red Flag \u2013 Alaska. This was the first time an RQ-4 had landed in Alaska during a simulated combat training exercise.\nOn 21 April 2021, a Global Hawk was reported to have made a reconnaissance flight in an airspace off the coast of southern Crimea which Russia had temporarily closed up to from Sevastopol to Feodosiya, issuing a relevant NOTAM. The Global Hawk reportedly departed from Naval Air Station Sigonella on Sicily.\nOn 22 February 2022, a Global Hawk was reported to have made a reconnaissance flight over Southeastern Ukraine coinciding with a NOTAM order by Ukrainian government and increased Russian military activity. The Global Hawk departed from Naval Air Station Sigonella on Sicily.\nRecords.\nOn 24 April 2001, a Global Hawk flew non-stop from Edwards AFB to RAAF Base Edinburgh in Australia, making history by being the first pilotless aircraft to cross the Pacific Ocean. The flight took 22 hours, and set a world record for absolute distance flown by a UAV, .\nOn 22 March 2008, a Global Hawk set the endurance record for full-scale, operational uncrewed aircraft UAVs by flying for 33.1 hours at altitudes up to 60,000\u00a0feet over Edwards AFB.\nFrom its first flight in 1998 to 9 September 2013, the combined Global Hawk fleet flew 100,000 hours. 88 percent of flights were conducted by USAF RQ-4s, while the remaining hours were flown by NASA Global Hawks, the EuroHawk, the Navy BAMS demonstrator, and the MQ-4C Triton. Approximately 75 percent of flights were in combat zones; RQ-4s flew in operations over Afghanistan, Iraq, and Libya; and supported disaster response efforts in Haiti, Japan, and California.\nFrom 10 to 16 September 2014, the RQ-4 fleet flew a total of 781 hours, the most hours flown by the type during a single week. 87 percent of flights were made by USAF RQ-4s, with the rest flown by the Navy BAMS-D and NASA hurricane research aircraft.\nThe longest Global Hawk combat sortie lasted 32.5 hours.\nDowning by Iran.\nOn 19 June 2019, a U.S. Navy BAMS-D RQ-4A from NAS Patuxent River flying over the Persian Gulf near the Strait of Hormuz was shot down by a 3rd Khordad surface-to-air missile fired from near Garuk, Iran. Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif said that the drone had been in Iranian airspace, while the United States maintained that the drone was in international airspace 18 nautical miles (34 km) away from Iran.\nNASA.\nIn December 2007, two Global Hawks were transferred from the USAF to NASA's Dryden Flight Research Center at Edwards AFB. Initial research activities beginning in the second quarter of 2009 supported NASA's high-altitude, long-duration Earth science missions. The two Global Hawks were the first and sixth aircraft built under the original DARPA Advanced Concept Technology Demonstration program, and were made available to NASA when the Air Force had no further need for them. Northrop Grumman is an operational partner with NASA and will use the aircraft to demonstrate new technologies and to develop new markets for the aircraft, including possible civilian uses.\nIt was reported in the March 2010 issue of \"Scientific American\" that NASA's Global Hawks were to begin scientific missions that month, and had been undergoing tests in late 2009. Initial science applications included measurements of the ozone layer and cross-Pacific transport of air pollutants and aerosols. The author of the Scientific American article speculates that it could be used for Antarctic exploration while being based in Chile. In August\u2013September 2010, one of the two Global Hawks was loaned for NASA's GRIP (Genesis and Rapid Intensification Program) mission.\nIts long-term on station capabilities and long range made it a suitable aircraft for monitoring the development of Atlantic basin hurricanes. It was modified to equip weather sensors including Ku-band radar, lightning sensors and dropsondes. It successfully flew into Hurricane Earl off the United States East Coast on 2 September 2010.\nNATO.\nIn 2009, NATO announced that it expected to have a fleet of up to eight Global Hawks by 2012 to be equipped with MP-RTIP radar systems. NATO had budgeted US$1.4 billion (\u20ac1 billion) for the project, and a letter of intent was signed. NATO signed a contract for five Block 40 Global Hawks in May 2012. 12 NATO members are participating in the purchase. On 10 January 2014, Estonia revealed it wanted to participate in NATO Global Hawk usage. In July 2017, the USAF assigned the Mission Designation Series (MDS) of RQ-4D to the NATO AGS air vehicle.\nThe first RQ-4D aircraft arrived at Sigonella Air Base on 21 November 2019. At that time, all five aircraft were undergoing developmental test flights. Initial operational capability was expected in the first half of 2020.\nIn October 2018, Italy certified five of the drones for use in Sigonella, Sicily in 2020. However, by 23 December 2019, there were regulatory issues for the Global Hawks concerning shared space between Germany and Italy. German government officials criticized the new drones for their lack of technology to avoid collisions with other aircraft.\nSouth Korea.\nIn 2011, South Korea's Defense Acquisition Program Administration (DAPA) expressed interest in acquiring at least four RQ-4Bs to increase intelligence capabilities following the exchange of the Wartime Operational Control from the U.S. to the Republic of Korea. Officials debated on the topic of the Global Hawks and domestic UAV programs. In September 2011, the US and South Korea discussed aircraft deployments near its land border to view North Korea and the North Korea\u2013China border.\nIn January 2012, DAPA announced that it would not proceed with a purchase due to a price rise from US$442M to US$899M, and that other platforms such as the AeroVironment Global Observer or the Boeing Phantom Eye were being investigated. However, in December 2012, South Korea notified Congress of a possible Foreign Military Sale of 4 RQ-4 Block 30 (I) Global Hawks with the Enhanced Integrated Sensor Suite (EISS) at an estimated cost of $1.2 billion (~$ in 2024). On 5 July 2013, the Korean National Assembly advised the government to re-evaluate the RQ-4 purchase, again citing high costs.\nOn 17 December 2014, Northrop Grumman was awarded a $657 million contract by South Korea for four RQ-4B Block 30 Global Hawks. The first RQ-4 arrived on 23 December 2019 at a base near Sacheon. The second arrived on 19 April 2020, and the third by June. The fourth and final Global Hawk was delivered in September 2020.\nJapan.\nOn 24 August 2013, Japan announced that the Japan Air Self-Defense Force planned to operate one Global Hawk jointly with the U.S. by 2015. On 21 November 2014, the Japanese Ministry of Defense officially decided to procure the Global Hawk instead of the General Atomics Guardian ER; Japan has also been interested in the purchase of three aircraft. The first Japanese Global Hawk landed at Misawa Air Base on 12 March 2022.\nPotential operators.\nAustralia considered the purchase of a number of Global Hawks for maritime and land surveillance. The Global Hawk was to be assessed against the General Atomics MQ-9 Mariner in trials in 2007. The Global Hawk aircraft would have operated in conjunction with crewed Boeing P-8 Poseidon aircraft, as a replacement of aging Lockheed AP-3C Orion aircraft. In the end, the Australian government decided not to proceed and canceled the order. In 2012, a procurement effort for seven UAVs by 2019 was initiated. In May 2013 the Australian government confirmed its interest in acquiring the MQ-4C Triton maritime surveillance variant.\nCanada has also been a potential customer, looking at the Global Hawk for maritime and land surveillance as either a replacement for its fleet of Lockheed CP-140 Aurora patrol aircraft or to supplement crewed patrols of remote Arctic and maritime environments, before withdrawing from the joint effort in August 2011. Spain has a similar requirement, and has existing contacts with Northrop Grumman.\nThe New Zealand Defence Force is studying the Global Hawk, which has the range to conduct surveillance in the Southern Ocean around Antarctica, and in the Pacific Islands. The acquisition process has not moved beyond an expression of interest.\nThe Indian Navy has expressed interest in acquiring six to eight MQ-4C Maritime Surveillance Unmanned Aircraft Systems.\nIn September 2018, Transport Canada was looking into buying a former German Air Force EuroHawk for surveillance missions in the Arctic. The EuroHawk cannot currently fly and has no equipment inside such as GPS and navigation tools.\n For USN Broad Area Maritime Surveillance (BAMS) role; previously known as the \"RQ-4N\"; 4 ordered, 68 total planned.\n Equipped with the Battlefield Airborne Communications Node (BACN) system.\n Proposed autonomous tanker variant.\n Scaled Composites and Northrop Grumman also offered an armed, 50% smaller version of the RQ-4A, known as the Scaled Composites Model 396, as part of the USAF Hunter-Killer program. The aircraft was rejected in favor of the MQ-9 Reaper.\nSpecifications (RQ-4B Block 30/40).\n\"Data from\" Northrop Grumman USAFGeneral characteristics* Crew: 0 onboard (3 remote: Launch and Recovery Element (LRE) pilot; Mission Control Element (MCE) pilot and sensor operator)* Length: ()* Wingspan: * Height: * Empty weight: * Gross weight: * Powerplant: 1 \u00d7 Rolls-Royce F137-RR-100\n turbofan engine\n, thrust \nPerformance* Maximum speed: (, )* Cruise speed: (, ) * Range: (, ) * Endurance: 34+ hours* Service ceiling: * Lift-to-drag: 33\nSee also.\nRelated development\nAircraft of comparable role, configuration, and era\nRelated lists\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Initially tested aboard USS \"Iowa\", the RQ-2 Pioneer was placed aboard s to provide gunnery spotting, its mission evolving into reconnaissance and surveillance, primarily for amphibious forces.\nIt was developed jointly by AAI Corporation and Israel Aircraft Industries. The program grew out of successful testing and field operation of the Tadiran Mastiff UAV by the American and Israeli militaries.\nEssentially, the Pioneer is an upgraded IAI Scout which was re-engined to accommodate a greater payload by request of the US Navy. To accomplish this, the original \"Limbach\" two-cylinder two-stroke engine was replaced with a Fichtel &amp; Sachs two-cylinder two-stroke. The Limbach motor used a 71\u00a0cm propeller from Propeller Engineering and Duplicating, Inc. of San Clemente, California. The newer, more powerful Fichtel &amp; Sachs motor was outfitted with a 74\u00a0cm propeller (which spins in the opposite direction) from the Sensenich Propeller Manufacturing Company of Lancaster, Pennsylvania.\nOperation.\nLaunched by rocket assist (shipboard), by catapult, or from a runway, the Pioneer recovers into a net (shipboard) or with arresting gear after flying up to five hours with a payload. It flies day or night missions with a gimbaled EO/IR sensor, relaying analog video in real time via a C-band line-of-sight (LOS) data link. Since 1991, Pioneer has flown reconnaissance missions during the Persian Gulf, Somalia (UNOSOM II), Bosnia, Kosovo and Iraq conflicts. In 2005, the Navy operated two Pioneer systems (one for training) and the Marines operated two, each with five or more aircraft. It is also operated by Israel and the Republic of Singapore Air Force. In 2007 Pioneer was retired by the US Navy and was replaced by the Shadow UAV.\nInternationally, Pioneer drones are perhaps most remembered for their role in the 1991 Gulf War, when a Pioneer launched by the observed Iraqi troops on Failaka Island surrendering shortly after 's attack on their trenchlines. When navy officials offered to transfer a Pioneer to the Smithsonian Institution, curators at the National Air and Space Museum specifically asked for the UAV that Iraqi troops surrendered to during the Gulf War.\nIn the 1991 Gulf War, the US Army operated a UAV Platoon from Ft. Huachuca, Arizona. The UAV Platoon conducted flight surveillance and target acquisition missions from KKMC and later, the unit pushed north (Operation Sand Hawk) where US Army combat engineers built a metal runway for the aircraft to launch and recover.\nThe \"R\" is the Department of Defense designation for reconnaissance; \"Q\" means unmanned aircraft system.

It took off and landed (using arresting gear) on runways. It used a gimbaled EO/IR sensor to relay its video in real time via a second airborne Hunter over a C-band line-of-sight data link. The RQ-5 is based on the Hunter UAV that was developed by Israel Aerospace Industries.\nDesign and development.\nSystem acquisition and training started in 1994 but production was cancelled in 1996 due to concerns over program mismanagement. Seven low rate initial production (LRIP) systems of eight aircraft each were acquired, four of which remained in service: one for training and three for doctrine development, exercise, and contingency support. Hunter was to be replaced by the RQ-7 Shadow, but instead of being replaced, the Army kept both systems in operation because the Hunter had significantly larger payload, range, and time-on-station capabilities than the Shadow.\nOperational history.\nIn 1995, A Company, 15th Military Intelligence Battalion (Aerial Exploitation) out of Fort Hood, Texas was the first U.S. Army field unit equipped with the Hunter. A Company conducted multiple successful training rotations to the National Training Center. Then in March 1999, they were deployed to the Republic of Macedonia in support of NATO operations in Kosovo where one was shot down by a Yugoslav Mil Mi-8 side 7.62x54mmR machine gun. During the 78 days of the NATO-led campaign, at least seven Hunter UAVs were lost. During the seven-month operation, the Hunter was flown for over 4,000 hours. Significant operational success in Kosovo led to a resumption of production and technical improvements. Hunter was used in Iraq and other military operations since then. The system was also armed with the Viper Strike munitions.\nThe Army's Unmanned Aircraft Systems Training Battalion at Fort Huachuca, AZ trained soldiers and civilians in the operation and maintenance of the Hunter UAV.\nIn 2004, the United States Department of Homeland Security, Bureau of Customs and Border Protection, Office of Air and Marine utilized the Hunter under a trial program for border patrol duties. During this program, the Hunter flew 329 flight hours, resulting in 556 detections.\nA version armed with the Northrop Grumman GBU-44/B Viper Strike weapon system is known as the MQ-5A/B.\nAs of October 2012, the U.S. Army had 20 MQ-5B Hunters in service. Retirement of the Hunter was expected to be completed in 2013, but Northrop was awarded a support contract for the Hunter in January 2013, extending its missions into 2014.\nOn 7 October 2013, the U.S. Army opened a UAS facility at Vilseck Army Airfield in Germany. A letter of agreement between the U.S. and Germany allows the 7th Army Joint Multinational Training Command to use two \u2018air bridges\u2019 in the east of the country to train operators, marking the first time a U.S. UAV will fly beyond the limits of military training areas. Two unarmed MQ-5B Hunters were used solely for training drone operators.\nFrom 1996 to January 2014, the MQ-5B Hunter unmanned aerial system flew over 100,000 hours with the U.S. Army.\nOn 14 March 2014, an RQ-5 was reported downed by a Crimean self-defense unit over Russian occupied Ukrainian territory, although Russia did not substantiate the claim and the Pentagon denies it operated such a vehicle over Crimea.\nOn 16 December 2015, the Hunter flew its final flight in Army service at Fort Hood. Since entering service in 1995, the aircraft had been deployed to the Balkans, Iraq, and Afghanistan. It was deployed to the Balkans four times between 1999 and 2002, accumulating 6,400 flight hours, and was the first Army UAS to cross into Iraq in 2003, proving itself for the first time in contingency operations as an intelligence asset to commanders at all levels and flying more hours than any other NATO reconnaissance platform. One capability unique to the Hunter was its relay mode that allowed one aircraft to control another at extended ranges or over terrain obstacles. By the end of Operation New Dawn in 2011, Hunters had flown more than 110,000 hours, its battlefield success clearly showing the value of UASs in combat operations as a direct result. While Army operators transitioned to the larger and more capable General Atomics MQ-1C Gray Eagle, the Hunter is being transferred to government-owned, contractor-operated units supporting operations overseas.\nInternational use.\nIn 1998, the Belgian Air Component purchased three B-Hunter UAV-systems, each consisting of six aircraft and two ground control stations. Operational from 2004 in the 80 UAV Squadron, 13 aircraft were in service in 2020. The last Hunter was withdrawn from Belgian service on 28 August 2020, to be replaced by the MQ-9B SkyGuardian.\nSpecifications.\n\"Data from\" General characteristics* Capacity: Payload:* Aspect ratio: * Fuel capacity: 300 Liters (79.3 gal)* Propellers: -bladed\nPerformance* Maximum speed: Mach * Endurance: 21 Hours* g limits: * Roll rate: * Maximum glide ratio: \nArmament\nSee also.\nRelated lists\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "37379", "revid": "27015025", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37379", "title": "Relative density", "text": "Ratio of two densities\nRelative density, also called specific gravity, is a dimensionless quantity defined as the ratio of the density (mass divided by volume) of a substance to the density of a given reference material. Specific gravity for solids and liquids is nearly always measured with respect to water at its densest (at ); for gases, the reference is air at room temperature (). The term \"relative density\" (abbreviated r.d. or RD) is preferred in SI, whereas the term \"specific gravity\" is gradually being abandoned.\nIf a substance's relative density is less than 1 then it is less dense than the reference; if greater than 1 then it is denser than the reference. If the relative density is exactly 1 then the densities are equal; that is, equal volumes of the two substances have the same mass. If the reference material is water, then a substance with a relative density (or specific gravity) less than 1 will float in water. For example, an ice cube, with a relative density of about 0.91, will float. A substance with a relative density greater than 1 will sink.\nTemperature and pressure must be specified for both the sample and the reference. Pressure is nearly always 1 atm (101.325 kPa). Where it is not, it is more usual to specify the density directly. Temperatures for both sample and reference vary from industry to industry. In British brewing practice, the specific gravity, as specified above, is multiplied by 1000. Specific gravity is commonly used in industry as a simple means of obtaining information about the concentration of solutions of various materials such as brines, must weight (syrups, juices, honeys, brewers wort, must, etc.) and acids.\nBasic calculation.\nRelative density (formula_1) or specific gravity (formula_2) is a dimensionless quantity, as it is the ratio of either densities or weights\nformula_3\nwhere formula_1 is relative density, formula_5 is the density of the substance being measured, and formula_6 is the density of the reference. (By convention formula_7, the Greek letter rho, denotes density.)\nThe reference material can be indicated using subscripts: formula_8 which means \"the relative density of \"substance\" with respect to \"reference\"\". If the reference is not explicitly stated then it is normally assumed to be water at 4\u00a0\u00b0C (or, more precisely, 3.98\u00a0\u00b0C, which is the temperature at which water reaches its maximum density). In SI units, the density of water is (approximately) 1000\u00a0kg/m3 or 1\u00a0g/cm3, which makes relative density calculations particularly convenient: the density of the object only needs to be divided by 1000 or 1, depending on the units.\nThe relative density of gases is often measured with respect to dry air at a temperature of 20\u00a0\u00b0C and a pressure of 101.325 kPa absolute, which has a density of 1.205\u00a0kg/m3. Relative density with respect to air can be obtained by\nformula_9\nwhere formula_10 is the molar mass and the approximately equal sign is used because equality pertains only if 1 mol of the gas and 1\u00a0mol of air occupy the same volume at a given temperature and pressure, i.e., they are both ideal gases. Ideal behaviour is usually only seen at very low pressure. For example, one mol of an ideal gas occupies 22.414 L at 0\u00a0\u00b0C and 1 atmosphere whereas carbon dioxide has a molar volume of 22.259 L under those same conditions.\nThose with SG greater than 1 are denser than water and will, disregarding surface tension effects, sink in it. Those with an SG less than 1 are less dense than water and will float on it. In scientific work, the relationship of mass to volume is usually expressed directly in terms of the density (mass per unit volume) of the substance under study. It is in industry where specific gravity finds wide application, often for historical reasons.\nTrue specific gravity of a liquid can be expressed mathematically as:\nformula_11\nwhere formula_12 is the density of the sample and formula_13 is the density of water.\nThe apparent specific gravity is simply the ratio of the weights of equal volumes of sample and water in air:\nformula_14\nwhere formula_15 represents the weight of the sample measured in air and formula_16 the weight of an equal volume of water measured in air.\nIt can be shown that true specific gravity can be computed from different properties:\nformula_17\nwhere \"g\" is the local acceleration due to gravity, \"V\" is the volume of the sample and of water (the same for both), \"\u03c1\"sample is the density of the sample, \"\u03c1\"H2O is the density of water, \"W\"V represents a weight obtained in vacuum, formula_18 is the mass of the sample and formula_19 is the mass of an equal volume of water.\nThe density of water and of the sample varies with temperature and pressure, so it is necessary to specify the temperatures and pressures at which the densities or weights were determined. Measurements are nearly always made at 1 nominal atmosphere (101.325\u00a0kPa \u00b1 variations from changing weather patterns), but as specific gravity usually refers to highly incompressible aqueous solutions or other incompressible substances (such as petroleum products), variations in density caused by pressure are usually neglected at least where apparent specific gravity is being measured. For true (\"in vacuo\") specific gravity calculations, air pressure must be considered (see below). Temperatures are specified by the notation (\"T\"s/\"T\"r), with \"T\"s representing the temperature at which the sample's density was determined and \"T\"r the temperature at which the reference (water) density is specified. For example, SG (20\u00a0\u00b0C/4\u00a0\u00b0C) would be understood to mean that the density of the sample was determined at 20\u00a0\u00b0C and of the water at 4\u00a0\u00b0C. Taking into account different sample and reference temperatures, while \"SG\"H2O = (20\u00a0\u00b0C/20\u00a0\u00b0C), it is also the case that \"SG\"H2O = &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;\u2044 = (20\u00a0\u00b0C/4\u00a0\u00b0C). Here, temperature is being specified using the current ITS-90 scale and the densities used here and in the rest of this article are based on that scale. On the previous IPTS-68 scale, the densities at 20\u00a0\u00b0C and 4\u00a0\u00b0C are and respectively, resulting in an SG (20\u00a0\u00b0C/4\u00a0\u00b0C) value for water of .\nAs the principal use of specific gravity measurements in industry is determination of the concentrations of substances in aqueous solutions and as these are found in tables of SG versus concentration, it is extremely important that the analyst enter the table with the correct form of specific gravity. For example, in the brewing industry, the Plato table lists sucrose concentration by weight against true SG, and was originally (20\u00a0\u00b0C/4\u00a0\u00b0C) i.e. based on measurements of the density of sucrose solutions made at laboratory temperature (20\u00a0\u00b0C) but referenced to the density of water at 4\u00a0\u00b0C which is very close to the temperature at which water has its maximum density, \"\u03c1\"H2O equal to 999.972\u00a0kg/m3 in SI units ( in cgs units or 62.43\u00a0lb/cu\u00a0ft in United States customary units). The ASBC table in use today in North America for apparent specific gravity measurements at (20\u00a0\u00b0C/20\u00a0\u00b0C) is derived from the original Plato table using Plato et al.\u2018s value for SG(20\u00a0\u00b0C/4\u00a0\u00b0C) = . In the sugar, soft drink, honey, fruit juice and related industries, sucrose concentration by weight is taken from a table prepared by A. Brix, which uses SG (17.5\u00a0\u00b0C/17.5\u00a0\u00b0C). As a final example, the British SG units are based on reference and sample temperatures of 60\u00a0\u00b0F and are thus (15.56\u00a0\u00b0C/15.56\u00a0\u00b0C).\nGiven the specific gravity of a substance, its actual density can be calculated by rearranging the above formula:\nformula_20\nOccasionally a reference substance other than water is specified (for example, air), in which case specific gravity means density relative to that reference.\n\"See Density for a table of the measured densities of water at various temperatures.\"\nTemperature dependence.\nThe density of substances varies with temperature and pressure so that it is necessary to specify the temperatures and pressures at which the densities or masses were determined. It is nearly always the case that measurements are made at nominally 1 atmosphere (101.325\u00a0kPa ignoring the variations caused by changing weather patterns) but as relative density usually refers to highly incompressible aqueous solutions or other incompressible substances (such as petroleum products) variations in density caused by pressure are usually neglected at least where apparent relative density is being measured. For true (\"in vacuo\") relative density calculations air pressure must be considered (see below). Temperatures are specified by the notation (\"Ts\"/\"Tr\") with \"Ts\" representing the temperature at which the sample's density was determined and \"Tr\" the temperature at which the reference (water) density is specified. For example, SG (20\u00a0\u00b0C/4\u00a0\u00b0C) would be understood to mean that the density of the sample was determined at 20\u00a0\u00b0C and of the water at 4\u00a0\u00b0C. Taking into account different sample and reference temperatures, while SGH2O = 1.000000 (20\u00a0\u00b0C/20\u00a0\u00b0C) it is also the case that RDH2O = = 0.9982288 (20\u00a0\u00b0C/4\u00a0\u00b0C). Here temperature is being specified using the current ITS-90 scale and the densities used here and in the rest of this article are based on that scale. On the previous IPTS-68 scale the densities at 20\u00a0\u00b0C and 4\u00a0\u00b0C are, respectively, 0.9982041 and 0.9999720 resulting in an RD (20\u00a0\u00b0C/4\u00a0\u00b0C) value for water of 0.99823205.\nThe temperatures of the two materials may be explicitly stated in the density symbols; for example:\nrelative density: 8.15; or specific gravity: 2.432\nwhere the superscript indicates the temperature at which the density of the material is measured, and the subscript indicates the temperature of the reference substance to which it is compared.\nUses.\nRelative density can also help to quantify the buoyancy of a substance in a fluid or gas, or determine the density of an unknown substance from the known density of another. Relative density is often used by geologists and mineralogists to help determine the mineral content of a rock or other sample. Gemologists use it as an aid in the identification of gemstones. Water is preferred as the reference because measurements are then easy to carry out in the field (see below for examples of measurement methods).\nAs the principal use of relative density measurements in industry is determination of the concentrations of substances in aqueous solutions and these are found in tables of RD vs concentration it is extremely important that the analyst enter the table with the correct form of relative density. For example, in the brewing industry, the Plato table, which lists sucrose concentration by mass against true RD, were originally (20\u00a0\u00b0C/4\u00a0\u00b0C) that is based on measurements of the density of sucrose solutions made at laboratory temperature (20\u00a0\u00b0C) but referenced to the density of water at 4\u00a0\u00b0C which is very close to the temperature at which water has its maximum density of \"\u03c1\"(H2O) equal to 0.999972\u00a0g/cm3 (or 62.43\u00a0lb\u00b7ft\u22123). The ASBC table in use today in North America, while it is derived from the original Plato table is for apparent relative density measurements at (20\u00a0\u00b0C/20\u00a0\u00b0C) on the IPTS-68 scale where the density of water is 0.9982071\u00a0g/cm3. In the sugar, soft drink, honey, fruit juice and related industries sucrose concentration by mass is taken from this work which uses SG (17.5\u00a0\u00b0C/17.5\u00a0\u00b0C). As a final example, the British RD units are based on reference and sample temperatures of 60\u00a0\u00b0F and are thus (15.56\u00a0\u00b0C/15.56\u00a0\u00b0C).\nRelative density is use in medicine particularly in pharmaceutical field. It is used in automated compounders in preparation of multicomponent mixtures for parenteral nutrition, while it is an important factor in urinalysis, relative density is an indicator of both the concentration of particles in the urine and a patient's degree of hydration.\nMeasurement.\nRelative density can be calculated directly by measuring the density of a sample and dividing it by the (known) density of the reference substance. The density of the sample is simply its mass divided by its volume. Although mass is easy to measure, the volume of an irregularly shaped sample can be more difficult to ascertain. One method is to put the sample in a water-filled graduated cylinder and read off how much water it displaces. Alternatively the container can be filled to the brim, the sample immersed, and the volume of overflow measured. The surface tension of the water may keep a significant amount of water from overflowing, which is especially problematic for small samples. For this reason it is desirable to use a water container with as small a mouth as possible.\nFor each substance, the density, \"\u03c1\", is given by\nformula_21\nWhen these densities are divided, references to the spring constant, gravity and cross-sectional area simply cancel, leaving\nformula_22\nHydrostatic weighing.\nRelative density is more easily and perhaps more accurately measured without measuring volume. Using a spring scale, the sample is weighed first in air and then in water. Relative density (with respect to water) can then be calculated using the following formula:\nformula_23\nwhere\nThis technique cannot easily be used to measure relative densities less than one, because the sample will then float. \"W\"water becomes a negative quantity, representing the force needed to keep the sample underwater.\nAnother practical method uses three measurements. The sample is weighed dry. Then a container filled to the brim with water is weighed, and weighed again with the sample immersed, after the displaced water has overflowed and been removed. Subtracting the last reading from the sum of the first two readings gives the weight of the displaced water. The relative density result is the dry sample weight divided by that of the displaced water. This method allows the use of scales which cannot handle a suspended sample. A sample less dense than water can also be handled, but it has to be held down, and the error introduced by the fixing material must be considered.\nHydrometer.\nThe relative density of a liquid can be measured using a hydrometer. This consists of a bulb attached to a stalk of constant cross-sectional area, as shown in the adjacent diagram.\nFirst the hydrometer is floated in the reference liquid (shown in light blue), and the displacement (the level of the liquid on the stalk) is marked (blue line). The reference could be any liquid, but in practice it is usually water.\nThe hydrometer is then floated in a liquid of unknown density (shown in green). The change in displacement, \u0394\"x\", is noted. In the example depicted, the hydrometer has dropped slightly in the green liquid; hence its density is lower than that of the reference liquid. It is necessary that the hydrometer floats in both liquids.\nThe application of simple physical principles allows the relative density of the unknown liquid to be calculated from the change in displacement. (In practice the stalk of the hydrometer is pre-marked with graduations to facilitate this measurement.)\nIn the explanation that follows,\nSince the floating hydrometer is in static equilibrium, the downward gravitational force acting upon it must exactly balance the upward buoyancy force. The gravitational force acting on the hydrometer is simply its weight, \"mg\". From the Archimedes buoyancy principle, the buoyancy force acting on the hydrometer is equal to the weight of liquid displaced. This weight is equal to the mass of liquid displaced multiplied by \"g\", which in the case of the reference liquid is \"\u03c1\"ref\"Vg\". Setting these equal, we have\nformula_24\nor just\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Numbered block/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExactly the same equation applies when the hydrometer is floating in the liquid being measured, except that the new volume is \"V\" \u2212 \"A\"\u0394\"x\" (see note above about the sign of \u0394\"x\"). Thus,\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Numbered block/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCombining (1) and (2) yields\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Numbered block/styles.css\" /&gt;{\\rho_\\mathrm{ref}} = \\frac{V}{V - A \\Delta x}.&lt;/math&gt;|\nBut from (1) we have \"V\" = \"m\"/\"\u03c1\"ref. Substituting into (3) gives\nThis equation allows the relative density to be calculated from the change in displacement, the known density of the reference liquid, and the known properties of the hydrometer. If \u0394\"x\" is small then, as a first-order approximation of the geometric series equation (4) can be written as:\nformula_25\nThis shows that, for small \u0394\"x\", changes in displacement are approximately proportional to changes in relative density.\nPycnometer.\nA pycnometer (from ), also called pyknometer or specific gravity bottle, is a device used to determine the density of a liquid. A pycnometer is usually made of glass, with a close-fitting ground glass stopper with a capillary tube through it, so that air bubbles may escape from the apparatus. This device enables a liquid's density to be measured accurately by reference to an appropriate working fluid, such as water or mercury, using an analytical balance.\nIf the flask is weighed empty, full of water, and full of a liquid whose relative density is desired, the relative density of the liquid can easily be calculated. The particle density of a powder, to which the usual method of weighing cannot be applied, can also be determined with a pycnometer. The powder is added to the pycnometer, which is then weighed, giving the weight of the powder sample. The pycnometer is then filled with a liquid of known density, in which the powder is completely insoluble. The weight of the displaced liquid can then be determined, and hence the relative density of the powder.\nA gas pycnometer, the gas-based manifestation of a pycnometer, compares the change in pressure caused by a measured change in a closed volume containing a reference (usually a steel sphere of known volume) with the change in pressure caused by the sample under the same conditions. The difference in change of pressure represents the volume of the sample as compared to the reference sphere, and is usually used for solid particulates that may dissolve in the liquid medium of the pycnometer design described above, or for porous materials into which the liquid would not fully penetrate.\nWhen a pycnometer is filled to a specific, but not necessarily accurately known volume, \"V\" and is placed upon a balance, it will exert a force\nformula_26\nwhere \"m\"b is the mass of the bottle and \"g\" the gravitational acceleration at the location at which the measurements are being made. \"\u03c1\"a is the density of the air at the ambient pressure and \"\u03c1\"b is the density of the material of which the bottle is made (usually glass) so that the second term is the mass of air displaced by the glass of the bottle whose weight, by Archimedes Principle must be subtracted. The bottle is filled with air but as that air displaces an equal amount of air the weight of that air is canceled by the weight of the air displaced. Now we fill the bottle with the reference fluid e.g. pure water. The force exerted on the pan of the balance becomes:\nformula_27\nIf we subtract the force measured on the empty bottle from this (or tare the balance before making the water measurement) we obtain.\nformula_28\nwhere the subscript \"n\" indicated that this force is net of the force of the empty bottle. The bottle is now emptied, thoroughly dried and refilled with the sample. The force, net of the empty bottle, is now:\nformula_29\nwhere \"\u03c1\"s is the density of the sample. The ratio of the sample and water forces is:\nformula_30\nThis is called the \"apparent relative density\", denoted by subscript A, because it is what we would obtain if we took the ratio of net weighings in air from an analytical balance or used a hydrometer (the stem displaces air). Note that the result does not depend on the calibration of the balance. The only requirement on it is that it read linearly with force. Nor does \"RD\"A depend on the actual volume of the pycnometer.\nFurther manipulation and finally substitution of \"RD\"V, the true relative density (the subscript V is used because this is often referred to as the relative density ), for \"\u03c1\"s/\"\u03c1\"w gives the relationship between apparent and true relative density:\nformula_31\nIn the usual case we will have measured weights and want the true relative density. This is found from\nformula_32\nSince the density of dry air at 101.325\u00a0kPa at 20\u00a0\u00b0C is 0.001205\u00a0g/cm3 and that of water is 0.998203\u00a0g/cm3 we see that the difference between true and apparent relative densities for a substance with relative density (20\u00a0\u00b0C/20\u00a0\u00b0C) of about 1.100 would be 0.000120. Where the relative density of the sample is close to that of water (for example dilute ethanol solutions) the correction is even smaller.\nThe pycnometer is used in ISO standard: ISO 1183-1:2004, ISO 1014\u20131985 and ASTM standard: ASTM D854.\nTypes\nDigital density meters.\n\"Hydrostatic Pressure-based Instruments\": This technology relies upon Pascal's Principle which states that the pressure difference between two points within a vertical column of fluid is dependent upon the vertical distance between the two points, the density of the fluid and the gravitational force. This technology is often used for tank gauging applications as a convenient means of liquid level and density measure.\n\"Vibrating Element Transducers\": This type of instrument requires a vibrating element to be placed in contact with the fluid of interest. The resonant frequency of the element is measured and is related to the density of the fluid by a characterization that is dependent upon the design of the element. In modern laboratories precise measurements of relative density are made using oscillating U-tube meters. These are capable of measurement to 5 to 6 places beyond the decimal point and are used in the brewing, distilling, pharmaceutical, petroleum and other industries. The instruments measure the actual mass of fluid contained in a fixed volume at temperatures between 0 and 80\u00a0\u00b0C but as they are microprocessor based can calculate apparent or true relative density and contain tables relating these to the strengths of common acids, sugar solutions, etc.\n\"Ultrasonic Transducer\": Ultrasonic waves are passed from a source, through the fluid of interest, and into a detector which measures the acoustic spectroscopy of the waves. Fluid properties such as density and viscosity can be inferred from the spectrum.\n\"Radiation-based Gauge\": Radiation is passed from a source, through the fluid of interest, and into a scintillation detector, or counter. As the fluid density increases, the detected radiation \"counts\" will decrease. The source is typically the radioactive isotope caesium-137, with a half-life of about 30 years. A key advantage for this technology is that the instrument is not required to be in contact with the fluid\u2014typically the source and detector are mounted on the outside of tanks or piping.\n\"Buoyant Force Transducer\": the buoyancy force produced by a float in a homogeneous liquid is equal to the weight of the liquid that is displaced by the float. Since buoyancy force is linear with respect to the density of the liquid within which the float is submerged, the measure of the buoyancy force yields a measure of the density of the liquid. One commercially available unit claims the instrument is capable of measuring relative density with an accuracy of \u00b1 0.005 RD units. The submersible probe head contains a mathematically characterized spring-float system. When the head is immersed vertically in the liquid, the float moves vertically and the position of the float controls the position of a permanent magnet whose displacement is sensed by a concentric array of Hall-effect linear displacement sensors. The output signals of the sensors are mixed in a dedicated electronics module that provides a single output voltage whose magnitude is a direct linear measure of the quantity to be measured.\nRelative density in soil mechanics.\nRelative density formula_33 a measure of the current void ratio in relation to the maximum and minimum void ratios, and applied effective stress control the mechanical behavior of cohesionless soil. Relative density is defined by formula_34\nin which formula_35, and formula_36 are the maximum, minimum and actual void ratios.\nLimitations.\nSpecific gravity (SG) is a useful concept but has several limitations. One major issue is its sensitivity to temperature since the density of both the substance being measured and the reference changes with temperature, affecting accuracy. It also assumes materials are incompressible, which isn't true for gasses or some liquids under varying pressures. It doesn't provide detailed information about a material\u2019s composition or properties beyond density. Errors can also occur due to impurities, incomplete mixing, or air bubbles in liquids, which can skew results.\nExamples.\nSubstances with a relative density of 1 are neutrally buoyant, those with RD greater than one are denser than water, and so (ignoring surface tension effects) will sink in it, and those with an RD of less than one are less dense than water, and so will float.\nExample:\nformula_37\nHelium gas has a density of 0.164\u00a0g/L; it is 0.139 times as dense as air, which has a density of 1.18\u00a0g/L.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It was named after the French explorer Jules Dumont d'Urville. With an area of approximately , it is the eighth-largest island of New Zealand, and has around 52 permanent residents. The local authority is the Marlborough District Council.\nHistory.\nThe original M\u0101ori name of the island is \"Rangitoto\", meaning \"blood red sky\" (\"rangi\" means sky; \"toto\" means blood). It is an ancient name brought from Hawaiki, the ancestral homeland of the M\u0101ori in the Pacific. The name was later lengthened to \"Rangitoto ki te Tonga\", the suffix meaning \"of the south\", to distinguish it from places in the North Island called \"Rangitoto\". The official name of the island is \"Rangitoto ki te Tonga / D'Urville Island\".\nThe island was a traditional source of argillite (\"pakohe\") for M\u0101ori, used in the production of stone tools such as adzes during the Archaic period (1300\u20131500). From the 1600s until the early 1800s, the island was a part of the rohe of Ng\u0101ti T\u016bmatak\u014dkiri. In the present day, the island is within the rohe of Ng\u0101ti Koata and Ng\u0101ti Kuia.\nGeography.\nThe island has a convoluted coastline, as is frequently found with islands formed from peaks between sea-drowned valleys. It extends for some northeast/southwest, and is a little over wide at its widest point. The eastern coast of the island is relatively smooth, marked mainly by the small D'Urville Peninsula, some halfway along its length. In contrast, the west coast is marked by three large inlets: Port Hardy in the north, Greville Harbour in the centre, and Manuhakapakapa in the south. Numerous smaller islands lie off the coast, notably Stephens Island, which lies off D'Urville's northernmost point, Cape Stephens. The island's highest point, Takap\u014dtaka / Attempt Hill () lies close to the centre of the island, due east of Greville Harbour. Most of the island's residents live close to the more sheltered east coast, with the localities of Patuki and Mukahanga being close to the northern tip of the island.\nThe island is separated from the mainland by the dangerous French Pass, known to M\u0101ori as Te Aumiti, through which water passes at up to at each tide. Several vortices occur near this passage. d'Urville investigated the passage for several days in 1827, and damaged his ship passing through it.\nFlora and fauna.\nThere is roughly 6,000ha (60km2) of public conservation land on D'urville Island, mainly through the centre of the island. The conservation land consists of regenerating farmland, coastal broadleaf, and beech forest.\nD'Urville Island is free of possums, feral goats, ship rats, Norway rats, and weasels making it important ecologically. Red deer and feral pigs are present on the Island and a permit can be obtained from the New Zealand Department of Conservation to hunt on the public conservation land.\nStoats on the island have caused the local extinction of the little spotted kiwi, South Island k\u0101k\u0101 and yellow-crowned k\u0101k\u0101riki. D'Urville Island Stoat Eradication Charitable Trust started in 2003 to attempt remove stoats from the island. A large scale stoat eradication programme was funded for the Island but after issues with land access the funding was withdrawn.\nThere is a population of the rare South Island long-tailed bat on the island.\nTransport.\nThere is a small airstrip at Moawhitu, Greville Harbour, that is maintained by the Department of Conservation. Pelorus Air has flights to D'Urville Island from Picton, Wellington and Paraparaumu.\nA barge service is operated by D'Urville Island Crossings between French Pass village and the settlement of Kapowai. There is also a water taxi operating between the D\u2019Urville Island Wilderness Resort at Catherine Cove and French Pass.\nDriftwood Eco Tours take small group tours to the island, focusing on its heritage and ecology and meeting with residents to learn about its unique features. Driftwood Eco Tours donate each year to 'DISECT' (D'Urville Island Stoat Eradication Trust). In 2016, Motueka-based Abel Tasman Sea Shuttles hosted a number of charity cruises around D'Urville Island in conjunction with the Rotary Club of Motueka.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

On the meaning of the names, see Ivan Kl\u00edma: \"Karel \u010capek: Life and Work\" (2002).\nPlot.\nSynopsis.\nThe play begins in a factory that makes artificial workers from synthetic organic matter. (As living creatures of artificial flesh and blood, that later terminology would call androids, the playwright's 'roboti' differ from later fictional and scientific concepts of inorganic constructs.) Robots may be mistaken for humans but have no original thoughts. Though most are content to work for humans, eventually a rebellion causes the extinction of the human race.\nPrologue (Act I in the Selver translation).\nHelena, the daughter of the president of a major industrial power, arrives at the island factory of Rossum's Universal Robots. Here, she meets Domin, the General Manager of R.U.R., who relates to her the history of the company. Rossum had come to the island in 1920 to study marine biology. In 1932, Rossum had invented a substance like organic matter, though with a different chemical composition. He argued with his nephew about their motivations for creating artificial life. While the elder wanted to create animals to prove or disprove the existence of God, his nephew only wanted to become rich. Young Rossum finally locked away his uncle in a lab to play with the monstrosities he had created and created thousands of robots. By the time the play takes place (circa the year 2000), robots are cheap and available all over the world. They have become essential for industry.\nAfter meeting the heads of R.U.R., Helena reveals that she is a representative of the League of Humanity, an organization that wishes to liberate the robots. The managers of the factory find this absurd. They see robots as appliances. Helena asks that the robots be paid, but according to R.U.R. management, the robots do not \"like\" anything.\nEventually Helena is convinced that the League of Humanity is a waste of money, but still argues robots have a \"soul\". Later, Domin confesses that he loves Helena and forces her into an engagement.\nAct I (Act II in Selver).\nTen years have passed. Helena and her nurse Nana discuss current events, the decline in human births in particular. Helena and Domin reminisce about the day they met and summarize the last ten years of world history, which has been shaped by the new worldwide robot-based economy. Helena meets Dr. Gall's new experiment, Radius. Dr. Gall describes his experimental robotess, also named Helena. Both are more advanced, fully-featured robots. In secret, Helena burns the formula required to create robots. The revolt of the robots reaches Rossum's island as the act ends.\nAct II (Act III in Selver).\nThe characters sense that the very universality of the robots presents a danger. Echoing the story of the Tower of Babel, the characters discuss whether creating national robots who were unable to communicate beyond their languages would have been a good idea. As robot forces lay siege to the factory, Helena reveals she has burned the formula necessary to make new robots. The characters lament the end of humanity and defend their actions, despite the fact that their imminent deaths are a direct result of their choices. Busman is killed while attempting to negotiate a peace with the robots. The robots storm the factory and kill all the humans except for Alquist, the company's Clerk of the Works (Head of Construction). The robots spare him because they recognize that \"He works with his hands like a robot. He builds houses. He can work.\"\nAct III (Epilogue in Selver).\nYears have passed. Alquist, who still lives, attempts to recreate the formula that Helena destroyed. He is a mechanical engineer, though, with insufficient knowledge of biochemistry, so he has made little progress. The robot government has searched for surviving humans to help Alquist and found none alive. Officials from the robot government beg him to complete the formula, even if it means he will have to kill and dissect other robots for it. Alquist yields. He will kill and dissect robots, thus completing the circle of violence begun in Act Two. Alquist is disgusted. Robot Primus and Helena develop human feelings and fall in love. Playing a hunch, Alquist threatens to dissect Primus and then Helena; each begs him to take him- or herself and spare the other. Alquist now realizes that Primus and Helena are the new Adam and Eve, and gives the charge of the world to them.\n\u010capek's conception of robots.\nThe robots described in \u010capek's play are not robots in the popularly understood sense of an automaton. They are not mechanical devices, but rather artificial\nbiological organisms that may be mistaken for humans. A comic scene at the beginning of the play shows Helena arguing with her future husband, Harry Domin, because she cannot believe his secretary is a robotess:\n&lt;poem&gt;\nDOMIN: Sulla, let Miss Glory have a look at you.\nHELENA: (stands and offers her hand) Pleased to meet you. It must be very hard for you out here, cut off from the rest of the world.\nSULLA: I do not know the rest of the world Miss Glory. Please sit down.\nHELENA: (sits) Where are you from?\nSULLA: From here, the factory.\nHELENA: Oh, you were born here.\nSULLA: Yes I was made here.\nHELENA: (startled) What?\nDOMIN: (laughing) Sulla isn't a person, Miss Glory, she's a robot.\nHELENA: Oh, please forgive me...\n&lt;/poem&gt;\nHis robots resemble more modern conceptions of man-made life forms, such as the Replicants in \"Blade Runner\", the \"hosts\" in the \"Westworld\" TV series and the humanoid Cylons in the re-imagined \"Battlestar Galactica\", but in \u010capek's time there was no conception of modern genetic engineering (DNA's role in heredity was not confirmed until 1952). There are descriptions of kneading-troughs for robot skin, great vats for liver and brains, and a factory for producing bones. Nerve fibers, arteries, and intestines are spun on factory bobbins, while the robots themselves are assembled like automobiles. \u010capek's robots are living biological beings, but they are still \"assembled\", as opposed to \"grown\" or \"born\".\nOne critic has described \u010capek's robots as epitomizing \"the traumatic transformation of modern society by the First World War and the Fordist assembly line\".\nOrigin of the word robot.\nThe play introduced the word \"robot\", which displaced older words such as \"automaton\" or \"android\" in languages around the world. In an article in \"Lidov\u00e9 noviny\", Karel \u010capek named his brother Josef as the true inventor of the word. In Czech, \"robota\" means forced labour of the kind that serfs had to perform on their masters' lands and is derived from \"rab\", meaning \"slave\".\nThe name \"Rossum\" is an allusion to the Czech word \"rozum\", meaning \"reason\", \"wisdom\", \"intellect\" or \"common sense\". It has been suggested that the allusion might be preserved by translating \"Rossum\" as \"Reason\" but only the Majer/Porter version translates the word as \"Reason\".\nProduction history and translations.\nThe work was published in two differing versions in Prague by Aventinum, first in 1920, followed by a revised version in 1921. After being postponed, it premiered at the city's National Theatre on 25 January 1921, although an amateur group had by then already presented a production.\nBy 1921, Paul Selver translated either the original 1920 edition of \"R.U.R.\" or a manuscript copy close to this version into English. He probably translated the play freelance, and sold it to St Martin's Theatre in London. Selver's translation was adapted for the British stage by Nigel Playfair in 1922, but it was not produced straight away. Later that year performance rights for the U.S. and Canada were sold to the New York Theatre Guild, perhaps during Lawrence Langner's visit to Britain. Playfair's version included several changes to \u010capek's original play, such as renaming the acts (the prologue became act one, and the heavily abridged final act became the epilogue), omitting around sixty lines (including most of Alquist's final speech), adding several more lines, and removing the robot character Damon (giving his lines to Radius). The omission of some lines may have been censorship from the Lord Chamberlain's Office, or self-censorship in anticipation of this, while some other changes might have been made by \u010capek himself if Selver was working from a manuscript copy. An edition of Playfair's adaptation was published by the Oxford University Press in 1923, and Selver went on to write a satiric novel \"One, Two, Three\" (1926) based on his experiences getting \"R.U.R.\" staged.\nThe American premi\u00e8re was produced by the Theatre Guild at the Garrick Theatre in New York City in October 1922, where it ran for 184 performances. In the first performance, Domin was portrayed by Basil Sydney, Marius by John Merton, Hallemeier by Moffat Johnston, Alquist by Louis Calvert, Busman by Henry Travers, the robot Helena by antiwar activist Mary Crane Hone in her Broadway debut, and Primus by John Roche. Spencer Tracy and Pat O'Brien played robots in their Broadway debuts. This production was based on Playfair's adaptation, though Theresa Helburn claimed that, together with two Czechs, they closely compared his version against \u010capek's original text, and that all changes from the original were made by the Theatre Guild as part of the rehearsal process. Doubleday published this version of the play in 1923, though it omitted a change noted by John Corbin in the \"New York Times\", of the robot Helena holding a robot baby in the final scene.\nIn April 1923 Basil Dean produced \"R.U.R.\" in Britain for the Reandean Company at St Martin's Theatre, London. This version was based on Playfair's adaptation, but omitted the characters Fabry and Hallemeier, and included several of the New York Theatre Guild revisions. The British Library holds a typescript copy of this version of the play, which had been submitted by St Martin's Theatre to the Lord Chamberlain's Office two weeks before the play opened.\nIn the 1920s, the play was performed in a number of American and British cities, including the Theatre Guild \"Road\" in Chicago and Los Angeles during 1923.\nIn June 1923, \u010capek sent a letter to Edward Marsh, with the final lines of \"R.U.R.\" that had been omitted from the Selver/Playfair editions, which he described as being \"suppressed in [the] English version\". This letter is held in Southern Illinois University Carbondale's Morris Library, along with an English translation of these lines, perhaps in Marsh's handwriting. This translation was published in the journal \"Science Fiction Studies\" (2001). A full translation of the final lines of the 1921 version of the play was published in the journal \"ICarbS\" (1981).\nIn 1989, a new, unabridged translation by Claudia Novack-Jones, based on \u010capek's revised 1921 version, restored the elements of the play eliminated by Playfair. Another unabridged translation was produced by Peter Majer and Cathy Porter for Methuen Drama in 1999. An open access unabridged translation by David Wyllie was published by the University of Adelaide in 2006, and updated in 2014.\nIn 2024, MIT Press published the book \"R.U.R. and the Vision of Artificial Life\", which offered a new translation of the original 1920 edition by \u0160t\u011bp\u00e1n \u0160imek. The book also contained a collection of essays reflecting on the play's legacy from scientists and scholars who work in artificial life and robotics.\nCritical reception.\nReviewing the New York production of \"R.U.R.\" in 1922, \"The Forum\" magazine described the play as \"thought-provoking\" and \"a highly original thriller\". John Clute has lauded \"R.U.R.\" as \"a play of exorbitant wit and almost demonic energy\" and lists the play as one of the \"classic titles\" of inter-war science fiction. Luciano Floridi has described the play thus: \"Philosophically rich and controversial, \"R.U.R.\" was unanimously acknowledged as a masterpiece from its first appearance, and has become a classic of technologically dystopian literature.\" Jarka M. Burien called \"R.U.R.\" a \"theatrically effective, prototypal sci-fi melodrama\".\nOn the other hand, Isaac Asimov, author of the \"Robot\" series of books and creator of the Three Laws of Robotics, stated: \"\u010capek's play is, in my own opinion, a terribly bad one, but it is immortal for that one word. It contributed the word 'robot' not only to English, but through English, to all the languages in which science fiction is now written.\" In fact, Asimov's \"Laws of Robotics\" are specifically and explicitly designed to prevent the kind of situation depicted in \"R.U.R.\", since Asimov's robots are created with a built-in total inhibition against harming human beings or disobeying them.\nDespite getting mostly positive responses, \u010capek himself was very disappointed by critics' simplistic understanding of the play. He saw the play as part comedy, and ending with faith that humanity would survive albeit in a different form, while the critics often considered it to be pessimistic or nihilistic, and purely either an updated \"Frankenstein\", an anti-capitalist satire, or a critique of contemporary political ideologies. The critics' interpretation may have been influenced by how heavily abridged the final act (or Epilogue) was in the Selver/Playfair translation.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "37388", "revid": "26448631", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37388", "title": "Central Florida Tourism Oversight District", "text": "Tax district in Florida, United States\nThe Central Florida Tourism Oversight District (CFTOD), formerly the Reedy Creek Improvement District (RCID), is the governing jurisdiction and special taxing district for the land of Walt Disney World Resort. It includes within Orange and Osceola counties in Florida, encompassing the cities of Bay Lake and Lake Buena Vista as well as unincorporated land. It acts with most of the same authority and responsibility as a county government.\nThe current district was created on February 27, 2023, after the Florida Legislature passed House Bill 9B to supersede the Reedy Creek Improvement Act, passed in 1967 at the behest of Walt Disney and his namesake media company during the planning stages of Walt Disney World. A major selling point in lobbying the Florida government to establish the original RCID was Walt Disney's proposal of the \"Experimental Prototype Community of Tomorrow\" (EPCOT), a real planned community intended to serve as a testbed for new city-living innovations. The company eventually abandoned Walt Disney's concepts for the experimental city, primarily building a resort similar to its other parks.\nThe Reedy Creek Improvement District managed by the Disney Company had the authority of a governmental body, but was not subject to the constraints of a governmental body. That changed under the 2023 act, which gave the governor of Florida the authority to name its board members, replacing the original five-member Board of Supervisors controlled by the Walt Disney Company, the majority landowner of the District.\nIn April 2022, the Florida Legislature passed a law to disestablish the RCID and other special districts formed before November 5, 1968, an act that some lawmakers said was retaliation for Disney's opposition to the Parental Rights in Education Act, dubbed the \"Don't Say Gay\" bill by its critics. The law would have taken effect in June 2023, but it was unclear what would happen to the $1\u00a0billion in bond liabilities held by the RCID. On February 9 and 10, 2023, the state legislature voted to revert most of the changes, replace the RCID board's five Disney-selected members with five members appointed by the Governor with confirmation by the Florida State Senate, and remove parts of the district's authority, such as the power to construct a nuclear power plant, airport, and stadium. The district's name was changed the day the bill was signed into law by Governor Ron DeSantis on February 27, 2023. On April 26, 2023, Disney filed a lawsuit against DeSantis. Federal Judge Allen Winsor ruled in favor of DeSantis on January 31, 2024, and Disney appealed to the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals. On March 27, 2024, Disney settled its state court lawsuits with CFTOD and, per the agreement, put the appeal of their federal lawsuit on hold while the company negotiates a new development agreement with CFTOD. The settlement came a day after DeSantis replaced two Disney critics on the CFTOD with two Disney supporters and two weeks after the Parental Rights in Education Act, as originally written, was substantially narrowed by a court settlement that both sides portrayed as a victory for their own cause.\nHistory.\nCreation.\nInitial steps.\nAfter the success of Disneyland in California, Walt Disney began planning a second park on the East Coast. He disliked the businesses that had sprung up around Disneyland, and wanted control of a much larger area of land for the new project. He flew over the Orlando-area site, and many other potential sites, in November 1963. Seeing the well-developed network of roads, including the planned Interstate 4 and Florida's Turnpike, with McCoy Air Force Base (later Orlando International Airport) to the east, he selected a centrally located site near Bay Lake. He used multiple shell companies to buy up land, at very low prices, that eventually would be included within the district. These company names are listed on the upper story windows of what is now the \"Main Street USA\" section of Walt Disney World, including Compass East Corporation; Latin-American Development and Management Corporation; Ayefour Corporation (named for nearby I-4); Tomahawk Properties, Incorporated; Reedy Creek Ranch, Incorporated; and Bay Lake Properties, Incorporated.\nOn March 11, 1966, these landowners, all fully owned subsidiaries of what is now the Walt Disney Company, petitioned the Circuit Court of the Ninth Judicial Circuit, which served Orange County, Florida, for the creation of the Reedy Creek Drainage District under Chapter 298 of the Florida Statutes. After a period during which some minor landowners within the boundaries opted out, the Drainage District was incorporated on May 13, 1966, as a public corporation. Among the powers of a Drainage District were the power to condemn and acquire property outside its boundaries \"for the public use\". It used this power at least once to obtain land for Canal C-1 (Bonnet Creek) through land that is now being developed as the Bonnet Creek Resort, a non-Disney resort.\nImprovement district and cities.\nWalt Disney knew that his plans for the land would be easier to carry out with more independence. Among his ideas for his Florida project was his proposed EPCOT, the Experimental Prototype Community of Tomorrow, which was to be a futuristic planned city (and which was also known as Progress City). He envisioned a real working city with both commercial and residential areas, but one that also continued to showcase and test new ideas and concepts for urban living. Therefore, the Disney company petitioned the Florida State Legislature for the creation of the Reedy Creek Improvement District, which would have almost total autonomy within its borders. Residents of Orange and Osceola counties did not need to pay any taxes unless they were residents of the district. Services like land use regulation and planning, building codes, surface water control, drainage, waste treatment, utilities, roads, bridges, fire protection, emergency medical services, and environmental services were overseen by the district. The only areas where the district had to submit to the county and state would be property taxes and elevator inspections. The planned EPCOT city was also emphasized in this lobbying effort.\nOn May 12, 1967, Governor Claude R. Kirk Jr. signed the Reedy Creek Improvement Act, adding the following Florida statutes to implement Disney's plans:\n* Chapter 67-764 created the Reedy Creek Improvement District;\n* Chapter 67-1104 established the City of Bay Lake; and\n* Chapter 67-1965 established the City of Reedy Creek (later renamed as the City of Lake Buena Vista around 1970.)\nAccording to a press conference held in Winter Park, Florida, on February 2, 1967, by Disney vice president Donn Tatum, the Improvement District and cities were created to serve \"the needs of those residing there\", because the company needed its own government to \"clarify the District's authority to [provide services] within the District's limits\", and because of the public nature of the planned development. The original city boundaries did not cover the whole Improvement District; they may have been intended as the areas where communities would be built for residential use. To maintain full control of the district, it was important for Disney to limit the voting rights of the inhabitants, rights which were only meant to include landowners owning more than one-half acre. Since Disney owned most of the land, the residents would simply be renting their homes. But after the 1968 \"Avery v. Midland County\" case, Disney feared that they would have to eventually give everyone living inside the district voting rights, and so the population was restricted to the two municipalities Bay Lake and Lake Buena Vista.\nFurther development.\nAfter Walt Disney died in 1966, the Disney company board decided that it did not want to be in the business of running a city, and abandoned many of his ideas for Progress City. The planned residential areas that Walt originally advocated for were never built. Richard Foglesong would later argue in his 2003 book, \"Married to the Mouse: Walt Disney World and Orlando\", that the Disney company abused its powers by remaining in complete control of the District.\nIn 1968, the Reedy Creek Improvement Act was held by the Supreme Court of Florida not to violate any provision of the state constitution. As the law, in part, declares that the District is exempt from all state land use regulation laws \"now or hereafter enacted,\" the attorney general of Florida issued in 1977 an opinion stating that this includes state requirements for developments of regional impact (DRIs).\nIn January 1990, the RCID was granted a $57-million allocation of tax-free state bonds over an agency with plans for a low-income housing development and all additional government applicants in a six-county region, as the state distributed the bond proceeds on a first-come order. Disney was criticized for the move, with a Republican gubernatorial candidate filing a lawsuit to stop the RCID from using the funds. Also, one state legislator moved to limit the RCID's ability to apply for the program.\nIn 1993, the land that eventually became the Disney-controlled town of Celebration, Florida\u2014which was built with many of Walt Disney's original ideas that had since evolved into a form of New Urbanism\u2014was deannexed from Bay Lake and the district. This was done to keep its residents from having power over Disney by providing for separate administration of the areas. Celebration lies on unincorporated land within Osceola County, with a thin strip of still-incorporated land separating it from the rest of the county. This strip of land contains canals and other land used by the district.\nAbolition.\nOn March 30, 2022, state representative Spencer Roach tweeted that Florida legislators had met twice within the past week to discuss the possibility of repealing the Reedy Creek Improvement Act and stripping Disney of its \"special privileges\" in the state. Roach and Florida governor Ron DeSantis later criticized Disney for the \"special perks\" the company enjoyed through use of the RCID. Roach said there had been previous attempts to eliminate the district. A bill analysis and fiscal impact statement for the bill was created on April 19, 2022, by Senator Jennifer Bradley. However, this analysis was unable to determine the impact the bill would have on either the residents served by the special district, or the local governments that would absorb the district's debts.\nOn April 20, 2022, the Florida Senate passed Senate Bill 4C (SB 4C) with a 23\u201316 vote that would abolish the special taxing district. If it became law, the bill would dissolve any independent special district in Florida established prior to November 5, 1968, including the RCID; the dissolution would take effect June 1, 2023.\nRepresentative Randy Fine sponsored a bill in the Florida House of Representatives to dissolve all six independent special districts in Florida established prior to November 5, 1968 (the date of the ratification of the Constitution of Florida), including the Reedy Creek Improvement District (RCID). On April 21, 2022, the bill was passed by the Florida House by a 70\u201338 vote. DeSantis signed the bill into law the following day. Some members of the Florida Legislature as well as political commentators said the bill was likely retaliation for Disney announcing its opposition to the Parental Rights in Education Act, dubbed by critics as the \"Don't Say Gay bill\". Representative Dotie Joseph dubbed SB 4C \"un-American\" adding that it was \"[p]unishing a company for daring to speak against a governor's radical-right political agenda\".\nThe bill which abolished the district did not have any provisions for the logistics or debt. Under its enabling act, the state vowed to bondholders that it wouldn't impair the ability of Reedy Creek to service its debt. By dissolving the district, the debt would have been subsumed by Orange and Osceola Counties. On May 16, 2022, Florida governor DeSantis said that he is looking into making the government take control of the special district but promised that local and state tax payers would not be paying for Reedy Creek's outstanding debt.\nIn 2023, DeSantis announced he would rename the district to Central Florida Tourism Oversight District instead of dissolving it, and replace five-board members which had been selected by Disney, with a new board with five members hand-picked by the governor. This was approved by the Florida state legislature on February 9 and 10, 2023. The bill was signed by Governor DeSantis on February 27.\nPotential repercussions.\nThe bill was passed after two days of discussions and without a fiscal impact analysis. This led to debates about the bill's effects on taxes and bond debt. Randy Fine, the Republican House sponsor of the bill, claimed a different type of district could be formed that would not move additional costs to taxpayers.\nDisney already pays property taxes to Orange and Osceola counties. The bill would not increase these counties' revenues but would force both counties to increase services within the former jurisdiction of the RCID. A tax collector for Orange County claimed the RCID's abolition would increase costs for taxpayers. Florida Senate Democratic member Gary Farmer also highlighted concerns that the dissolution would transfer over $1 billion in bond liabilities to all Florida taxpayers.\nPotential legal challenges.\nAnalysts expected legal challenges to the dissolution. One argument was that because the law targeted Disney in retaliation for a political position, it violated the company's free speech rights under the First Amendment to the United States Constitution.\nAnother argument is that the dissolution violates the contract the state of Florida made with bondholders not to alter or limit the powers of the district until all bonds were paid off, making the dissolution unconstitutional under the Contract Clause. Under Florida law, when a special district government, like the Reedy Creek Improvement District, is dissolved, the dissolution transfers \"title to all property owned by the preexisting special district government to the local general-purpose government, which shall also assume all indebtedness of the preexisting special district.\" In 1866, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that \"once a local government issues a bond based on an authorized taxing power, the state is contract-bound and cannot eliminate the taxing power supporting the bond\".\nLocal taxpayers did file suit in federal court, but this was dismissed in May 2022 for lack of standing for the First Amendment issue, and lack of demonstrated injury to the taxpayers. It was refiled in state court the same month.\nReorganization.\nOn December 2, 2022, the \"Financial Times\" reported that a deal between Representative Randy Fine, the Disney company and other members of the Florida state legislature was underway to keep the main Reedy Creek Improvement District agreement, since the District abolition law had yet to take effect. Such compromise was reportedly being drafted especially because former Disney CEO Bob Chapek, who openly opposed the Parental Rights in Education law, was fired, and the abolition of the District would represent a tax increase in cities and counties across Florida, which could endanger Governor DeSantis' nomination for the Republican Party in the 2024 presidential election.\nConcerns over possible debt transfer to counties, and taxpayers in Orange and Osceola Counties having to start paying for some Disney World services such as police, fire protection and road maintenance, led the legislature to mostly revert the changes. On February 9 and 10, 2023, the Florida State House and Senate, respectively, passed bills in a special session allowing the special tax district to remain, as well as leaving the ability for Disney to issue tax-exempt bonds and approve development plans without scrutiny from certain local regulators in place. Disney would no longer be able to appoint the five members of the tax district's board, which would instead be appointed by the governor and confirmed by the Florida State Senate, and some parts of the district's authority would be removed, such as the power to potentially construct a nuclear power plant, airport, and stadium. Governor DeSantis signed the bill on February 27.\nGeography.\nReedy Creek is a natural waterway whose flow, drainage, and destination have been altered over the years by human development. It begins west of the Bay Lake city limits and the Magic Kingdom, and then meanders south through Disney property, passing between Disney's Animal Kingdom and Blizzard Beach. It crosses Interstate 4 and exits Disney property west of Celebration and runs mostly through undeveloped territory east of Haines City. It empties into Lake Russell, and continues flowing southward into Cypress Lake, which is connected to the Kissimmee Chain of Lakes.\nGovernance.\nThe district is governed by a five-member Board of Supervisors. Each supervisor is appointed by the governor of Florida and confirmed by the Florida Senate. Supervisors serve for terms of four years, and may serve for up to three consecutive terms. Any individual currently or within the past three years employed by a theme park or entertainment company is prohibited from serving as a supervisor. The members appointed to the board following changes to the district in 2023, subject to Senate confirmation, are as follows:\nConcerns arose after the nominations, as all five proposed members are allies of Ron DeSantis, have donated to his political campaigns, or are active in other right-wing circles. Ziegler founded Moms for Liberty, a conservative group promoting \"anti-woke\" school policies and board members, and was a primary proponent of the Parental Rights in Education Act. Her husband was elected to lead the Republican Party of Florida shortly before the governance changes to the district went into effect. Martin Garcia, the proposed new chairperson of the board, donated $50,000 to DeSantis' political action committee, and according to Forbes, \"was also named in court testimony as having been consulted when DeSantis' administration was preparing to suspend local prosecutor Andrew Warren for espousing pro-abortion rights views\". Ron Peri runs The Gathering USA, a conservative Christian ministry for men in Florida, and previously claimed \"estrogen in the water from birth control pills\" has contributed to a rise in homosexuality, and has called homosexuality \"shameful\", \"deviant\", and that it was a cause of decline for the Roman Empire. Michael Sasso runs the Orlando chapter of the conservative Federalist Society, and Brian Aungst Jr. is a conservative Pinellas County attorney previously appointed to the 6th Circuit judicial nominating commission.\nOver the course of two public meetings, with the second on the day before the new Central Florida Tourism Oversight District was to take control, the Walt Disney Company and the Reedy Creek Improvement District signed a development agreement. This enacted restrictive covenants to limit the Improvement District's governing power over Disney properties, which include Walt Disney World. According to Peri, \"This essentially makes Disney the government. This board loses, for practical purposes, the majority of its ability to do anything beyond maintain the roads and maintain basic infrastructure.\" The agreement stated that, if a perpetual term is deemed invalid, a royal lives clause would be used in its place: namely, the agreement \"shall continue until twenty-one (21) years after the death of the last survivor of the descendants of King Charles III, king of England [sic], living as of the date of this agreement.\"\nFormer governance structure.\nBefore the passage of House Bill 9 in 2023 (HB 9 2023), the Board of Supervisors was elected by the landowners of the District, who receive one vote per acre of land. As the majority landowner in Reedy Creek, The Walt Disney Company essentially handpicked the members of the Board. Under this model, each member owned an undeveloped lot of land within the District\u2014the only land in the District not technically controlled by Disney or used for public road purposes.\nThe District headquarters are in a building in Lake Buena Vista, east of Disney Springs. The District runs the following services, primarily serving Disney:\nDisney provides transportation for guests and employees in the form of buses, ferries, and monorails, under the name Disney Transport. In addition, several Lynx public bus routes enter the District, with half-hour service between the Transportation and Ticket Center (and backstage areas at the Magic Kingdom) and Downtown Orlando and Kissimmee, and once-a-day service to more points, intended mainly for cleaning staff. Half-hourly service is provided, via Lynx, to Orlando International Airport (MCO).\nFire department.\nThe Reedy Creek Fire Department (RCFD) was created in 1968 to provide fire suppression for RCID. Later, RCFD provides fire suppression, emergency medical services, 911 communications, fire inspections, technical rescue services, and hazardous materials mitigation. EMS makes up approximately 85 percent of the call volume, with RCFD providing both Advanced Life Support and Basic Life Support. Its name was changed to District Fire Department (DFD) in 2024.\nThe Fire Department currently staffs four fire stations located throughout the district with 138 personnel across three shifts. They also maintain a staff of 86 administrative and support personnel including EMS team members (primarily located in each of the four Walt Disney World theme parks), 911 communicators, and fire inspectors. There are four engines, two tower trucks, one squad unit, eight rescue ambulances, and several special units.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Opened on October\u00a01, 1971, the resort is operated by Disney Experiences, a division of the Walt Disney Company. One of the most iconic and pioneering entertainment resort complexes in the world, it is a cornerstone in popular entertainment. The property covers nearly , of which half has been developed. \nWalt Disney World contains numerous recreational facilities designed to attract visitors for an extended stay, including four theme parks, two water parks, four golf courses, conference centers, a competitive sports complex and a shopping, dining and entertainment complex. Additionally, there are 31 Disney-owned resort hotels and one camping resort on the property, and many other non-Disney-operated resorts on and near the property.\nDesigned to supplement Disneyland in Anaheim, California, which had opened in 1955, the complex was developed by Walt Disney in the 1960s. Walt wanted to build a new park because Disneyland in California was limited from expanding by the establishments that sprung up around it. \"The Florida Project\", as it was known, was intended to present a distinct vision with its own diverse set of attractions. Walt Disney's original plans called for the inclusion of an \"Experimental Prototype Community of Tomorrow\" (EPCOT), a planned community intended to serve as a testbed for new city-living innovations. Walt Disney died on December 15, 1966, during the initial planning of the complex. After his death, the company wrestled with the idea of whether to bring the Disney World project to fruition; however, Walt's older brother, Roy O. Disney, came out of retirement to ensure Walt's biggest dream was realized. \nConstruction started in 1967, with the company building a resort similar to Disneyland, abandoning the planned community concept. Magic Kingdom was the first theme park to open in the complex in 1971, followed by EPCOT (known then as EPCOT Center) in 1982, Disney's Hollywood Studios (known then as the Disney-MGM Studios Theme Park) in 1989, and Disney's Animal Kingdom in 1998. Roy insisted the name of the entire complex be changed from Disney World to Walt Disney World, to memorialize his brother.\nIn 2018, Walt Disney World was the most visited vacation resort in the world, with an average annual attendance of more than 58 million. The resort is the largest single-site employer in the United States, the flagship destination of Disney's worldwide corporate enterprise and has become a staple of American popular culture.\nHistory.\nPlanning and construction.\nConception.\nIn 1959, Walt Disney Productions began looking for land to house a second resort to supplement Disneyland in Anaheim, California, which had opened in 1955. Market surveys at the time revealed that only 5% of Disneyland's visitors came from east of the Mississippi River, where 75% of the population of the United States lived. Additionally, Walt Disney disliked the businesses that had sprung up around Disneyland and wanted more control over a larger area of land in the next project.\nWalt Disney took a flight over a potential site in Orlando, Florida\u2014one of many\u2014in November 1963. After witnessing the well-developed network of roads and taking the planned construction of both Interstate 4 and Florida's Turnpike into account, with McCoy Air Force Base (later Orlando International Airport) to the east, Disney selected a centrally located site near Bay Lake. The development was referred to in-house as \"The Florida Project\". \nTo avoid a burst of land speculation, Walt Disney Productions used various dummy corporations to acquire of land. In May 1965, some of these major land transactions were recorded a few miles southwest of Orlando in Osceola County. In addition, two large tracts totaling $1.5 million were sold, and smaller tracts of flatlands and cattle pastures were purchased by exotically named companies, such as the \"Ayefour Corporation\", \"Latin-American Development and Management Corporation\", and the \"Reedy Creek Ranch Corporation\". Some are now memorialized on a window above Main Street, U.S.A. in the Magic Kingdom. The smaller parcels of land acquired were called \"outs\". They were lots platted in 1912 by the Munger Land Company and sold to investors. Most of the owners in the 1960s were happy to get rid of the land, which was mostly swamp at the time. \nAnother issue was the mineral rights to the land, which were owned by Tufts University. Without the transfer of these rights, Tufts could come in at any time and demand the removal of buildings to obtain minerals. Eventually, Disney's team negotiated a deal with Tufts to buy the mineral rights for $15,000.\nWorking strictly in secrecy, real estate agents unaware of their client's identity began making offers to landowners in April 1964, in parts of southwest Orange and northwest Osceola counties. The agents were careful not to reveal the extent of their intentions. They were able to negotiate numerous land contracts with some landowners, including large tracts of land for as little as $100 an acre. With the understanding that the recording of the first deeds would trigger intense public scrutiny, Disney delayed the filing of paperwork until a large portion of the land was under contract.\nEarly rumors and speculation about the land purchases assumed possible development by NASA in support of the nearby Kennedy Space Center, as well as references to other famous investors, such as Ford, the Rockefellers, and Howard Hughes. \nAn \"Orlando Sentinel\" news article published on May 20, 1965 acknowledged a popular rumor that Disney was building an \"East Coast\" version of Disneyland. However, the publication denied its accuracy based on an earlier interview with Disney at Kennedy Space Center. In that interview, he claimed a $50 million investment was in the works for Disneyland, and that he had no interest in building a new park. \nIn October 1965, editor Emily Bavar from the \"Sentinel\" visited Disneyland during the park's 10th-anniversary celebration. In an interview with Disney, she asked him if he was behind recent land purchases in Central Florida. Bavar later described that Disney \"looked like I had thrown a bucket of water in his face\", before denying the story. His reaction, combined with other research obtained during her Anaheim visit, led Bavar to write a story on October 21, 1965, where she predicted that Disney was building a second theme park in Florida. Three days later, after gathering more information from various sources, the \"Sentinel\" published another article headlined, \"We Say: 'Mystery' Industry Is Disney\".\nWalt Disney had originally planned to publicly reveal Disney World on November 15, 1965, but in light of the \"Sentinel\" story, Disney asked Florida Governor Haydon Burns to confirm the story on October 25. His announcement called the new theme park \"the greatest attraction in the history of Florida\". The official reveal was kept on the previously planned November 15 date, and Disney joined Burns in Orlando for the event.\nRoy Disney's oversight of construction.\nWalt Disney died from circulatory collapse caused by smoking-related lung cancer on December 15, 1966, before his vision was realized. According to the Walt Disney Archives, during Disney's lifetime, he personally visited and toured the site only twice: on November 16, 1965, the day after the press conference, and again for a second time, on May 26, 1966. His brother and business partner, Roy O. Disney, postponed his retirement to oversee construction of the resort's first phase.\nOn February 2, 1967, Roy O. Disney held a press conference at the Park Theatres in Winter Park, Florida. The role of EPCOT was emphasized in the film that was played. After the film, it was explained that for Disney World, including EPCOT, to succeed, a special district would have to be formed: the Reedy Creek Improvement District with two cities inside it, Bay Lake and Reedy Creek, now Lake Buena Vista. In addition to the standard powers of an incorporated city, which include issuance of tax-free bonds, the district would have immunity from any current or future county or state land-use laws. The only areas where the district had to submit to the county and state would be property taxes and elevator inspections. The legislation forming the district and the two cities, one of which was the Reedy Creek Improvement Act, was signed into law by Florida Governor Claude R. Kirk, Jr. on May 12, 1967. The Supreme Court of Florida then ruled in 1968 that the district was allowed to issue tax-exempt bonds for public projects within the district, despite the sole beneficiary being Walt Disney Productions.\nThe district soon began construction of drainage canals, and Disney built the first roads and the Magic Kingdom. The Contemporary Resort Hotel was completed in time for the park's opening on October 1, 1971, and the Polynesian Village Resort opened shortly after. The Palm and Magnolia golf courses near the Magic Kingdom had opened a few weeks before, while Fort Wilderness opened one month later. Twenty-four days after the park opened, Roy O. Disney dedicated the property and declared that it would be known as \"Walt Disney World\", in his brother's honor. In his own words: \"Everyone has heard of Ford cars. But have they all heard of Henry Ford, who started it all? Walt Disney World is in memory of the man who started it all, so people will know his name as long as Walt Disney World is here.\" After the dedication, Roy Disney asked Walt's widow, Lillian, what she thought of Walt Disney World. According to biographer Bob Thomas, she responded, \"I think Walt would have approved.\" Roy Disney died at age 78 on December 20, 1971, less than three months after the property opened.\nAdmission prices in 1971 were $3.50 for adults, $2.50 for juniors under age 18, and $1 for children under twelve.\n1980s\u20132020.\nMuch of Walt Disney's plans for his Progress City concept were abandoned after his death and after the company board decided that it did not want to be in the business of running a city. The concept evolved into the resort's second theme park, EPCOT Center, which opened in 1982 (renamed EPCOT in 1996). While still emulating Walt Disney's original idea of showcasing new technology, the park is closer to a world's fair than a \"community of tomorrow\". One of EPCOT's main attractions is the World Showcase, which highlights 11 countries across the globe. Some of the urban planning concepts from the original idea of EPCOT would instead be integrated into the community of Celebration, Florida, much later. The resort's third theme park, Disney-MGM Studios (renamed Disney's Hollywood Studios in 2008), opened in 1989 and is inspired by show business.\nIn the early 1990s, the resort was seeking permits for expansion. There was considerable environmentalist push-back, and the resort was convinced to engage in mitigation banking. In an agreement with The Nature Conservancy and the state of Florida, Disney purchased of land, adjacent to the park for the purpose of rehabilitating wetland ecosystems. The Disney Wilderness Preserve was established in April 1993, and the land was subsequently transferred to The Nature Conservancy. The Walt Disney Company provided additional funds for landscape restoration and wildlife monitoring.\nThe resort's fourth theme park, Disney's Animal Kingdom, opened in 1998.\nIn October 2009, Disney World announced a competition to find a town to become twinned with. In December 2009, after Rebecca Warren won the competition with a poem, they announced the resort will be twinned with the English town of Swindon.\nGeorge Kalogridis was named president of the resort in December 2012, replacing Meg Crofton, who had overseen the site since 2006.\nAs of October 27, 2014, Walt Disney World is covered by a permanent FAA prohibited airspace zone that restricts all airspace activities without approval from the federal government of the United States, including usage of drones.\nOn January 21, 2016, the resort's management structure was changed, with general managers within a theme park being in charge of an area or land, instead of on a functional basis, as previously configured. Theme parks have already had a vice-president overseeing them. Disney Springs and Disney Sports were also affected. Now hotel general managers manage a single hotel instead of some managing multiple hotels.\nOn October 18, 2017, it was announced that resort visitors could bring pet dogs to Disney's Yacht Club Resort, Disney's Port Orleans Resort \u2013 Riverside, Disney's Art of Animation Resort, and Disney's Fort Wilderness Resort &amp; Campground.\nIn 2019, Josh D'Amaro replaced George Kalogridis as president of the resort. He had previously held the position of vice president of Animal Kingdom. D'Amaro was subsequently promoted to chairman of Disney Parks, Experiences and Products in May 2020, succeeding Bob Chapek, who was promoted to CEO of the Walt Disney Company in February 2020. Jeff Vahle, who served as president of Disney Signature Experiences subsequently took over as president of the resort.\nMarch 2020\u2013present.\nOn March 12, 2020, a Disney spokesperson announced that Disney World and Disneyland Paris would temporarily close due to the COVID-19 pandemic, beginning March 15, 2020.\nIn 2020, Disney World laid off 6,500 employees and only operated at 25% capacity after reopening during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nIn June 2020[ [update]], Walt Disney World was chosen to host the NBA Bubble for play of the 2019\u201320 season of the National Basketball Association (NBA) to resume at the ESPN Wide World of Sports Complex. The ESPN Complex, hosts a variety of activities throughout the year, including runDisney marathon races and dance and cheer competitions in partnership with Varsity Cheer. It was also the site for the MLS is Back tournament.\nOn July 11, 2020, Disney World officially reopened, beginning operations at 25% capacity at the Magic Kingdom and Disney's Animal Kingdom, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic in Florida. Four days later, EPCOT and Disney's Hollywood Studios for operation at 25% capacity to the public. Masks were required at all times (including outdoors, on attractions, and while taking photos), all guests were required to have their temperature taken upon entry, plexiglass was installed on various attractions and transportation offerings, and shows that drew large crowds, such as parades and nighttime shows including \"Fantasmic!\" and \"Happily Ever After\" were not offered.\nIn November 2020, the resort increased the guest capacity to 35% at all four theme parks, and on May 13, 2021, CEO Bob Chapek announced a further increase of capacity, effective immediately; however, he did not say to what capacity level it would be raised. By mid-June 2021, temperature checks and mask mandates (except while on Disney transportation) had been lifted. In late July 2021, mask mandates were reinstated for all attractions and indoor areas in light of new guidance issued by the Centers for Disease Control as the delta variant drove a significant increase in local cases. These reinstated mandates were lifted in February 2022. In April 2022, following a court decision ending the federal mask mandate for public transportation, the mask mandates on Disney transportation were lifted.\nStarting on October 1, 2021, the resort honored its 50th anniversary with \"The World's Most Magical Celebration\", which lasted for 18 consecutive months ending on March 31, 2023.\nDisney's Magical Express, a complimentary transportation and luggage service offered to Walt Disney Resort guests that began in 2005, ended in January 2022. In August 2021, the Walt Disney Company announced that FastPass+, which had been free since its introduction in 1999, would be retired and replaced with Genie+, starting at $18 to $35 per day. This new system includes the option of adding \"Lightning Lane\", which will be used for top-tier attractions, for an additional charge. The pricing range depends on the crowd and day of purchase.\nOn April 22, 2022, the self-governing status which the Walt Disney Company had in the area around Disney World for more than 50 years came to an end after Florida Governor Ron DeSantis signed into law legislation requiring the area to come under the legal jurisdiction of the state of Florida. The new law also officially abolished The Reedy Creek Improvement District which the Walt Disney Company has used to run the area since May 1967, when then Florida Governor Claude Kirk signed into law legislation which granted the company special status. The law went into effect in June 2023. Along with this, as of May 2023, Governor Ron DeSantis has also been planning to target Disney's monorail system and let Florida's Department of Transportation inspect the privately owned system.&lt;templatestyles src=\"template:sticky header/styles.css\"/&gt;\nIn August 2025, Walt Disney World officials described the resort as entering \u201can unprecedented era of growth,\u201d announcing multiple new capital projects across its theme parks.\nLocation.\nThe Florida resort is not within Orlando city limits but is southwest of Downtown Orlando. Much of the resort is in southwestern Orange County, with the remainder in adjacent Osceola County. The property includes the cities of Lake Buena Vista and Bay Lake which are governed by the Central Florida Tourism Oversight District (formerly Reedy Creek Improvement District). The site is accessible from Central Florida's Interstate 4 via Exits 62B (World Drive), 64B (US 192 West), 65B (Osceola Parkway West), 67B (SR 536 West), and 68 (SR 535 North), Exit 6 on SR 417 South, the Central Florida GreeneWay and Exit 8 on SR 429, the Western Beltway. At its founding, the resort occupied approximately . Portions of the property have since been sold or de-annexed, including land now occupied by the Disney-built community of Celebration. By 2014, the resort occupied nearly (larger than Manhattan, New York City, which is 22.7 sq mi).\nThe company additionally acquired nearly , in separate transactions, between December 2018 and April 2020.\n12% of the site area is occupied by hotels and resorts, and 5% of the area is water.\nAttractions.\nGolf courses.\nDisney's property includes four golf courses open to the general public. The 18-hole golf courses are Disney's Palm (4.5 stars), Disney's Magnolia (4 stars), and Disney's Lake Buena Vista (4 stars). There is also a nine-hole walking course called Disney's Oak Trail, that features junior tees for younger golfers and a Footgolf course. Palm, Magnolia, and Oak Trail are connected and share one entrance near Shades of Green in the Magic Kingdom Resort Area, while the Lake Buena Vista course is located in the Disney Springs Resort Area. Although owned by the company, the Walt Disney World golf courses are operated by a third-party, Arnold Palmer Golf Management. The Magnolia and Palm courses played home to the PGA Tour's Walt Disney World Golf Classic from 1971 to 2012.\nAdditionally there is a fifth course, the Tranquilo Golf Course, located at the Four Seasons Resort on Disney property. The course is open only to guests staying at Four Seasons.\nResorts.\nAs of 2024[ [update]], there are 31 Disney owned and operated resort hotels and Disney Vacation Club (DVC) villas at the Walt Disney World Resort, along with one camping resort, Fort Wilderness, which includes traditional campgrounds and wood cabins. Together, they have approximately 23,000 rooms, 3,600 DVC villas and of conference meeting space. They are organized into three categories\u2014Deluxe, Moderate, and Value\u2014and five resort areas: the Magic Kingdom, EPCOT, Wide World of Sports, Animal Kingdom, or Disney Springs. Informally known as the \"Disney Bubble\", staying on property is considered an immersive experience.\nAdditionally, 12 independently operated hotels are located on property leased from Disney, offering approximately 7,300 additional rooms. There is also an on-site pet hotel operated by Best Friends Pet Care for guests traveling with animals.\nDisney-owned resorts.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"template:sticky header/styles.css\"/&gt;\nOn-site non-Disney resorts.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"template:sticky header/styles.css\"/&gt;\nBusiness segments.\nWalt Disney World has several departments that handle various activities and events that are offered throughout the year. These departments include:\nCampus.\nThe campus of Walt Disney World includes numerous buildings and spaces used solely for corporate management, castmember only services, and castmember recreation. The Walt Disney Company also owns and operates a corporate office complex in Celebration, Florida, home to Disney Cruise Line and Adventures by Disney offices.\nEmployment.\nWhen the Magic Kingdom opened in 1971, the site employed about 5,500 \"Cast Members\". In 2020, Walt Disney World employed more than 77,000 Cast Members. Walt Disney World has more than 3,000 job classifications with a total 2019 payroll of over $3 billion.\nUnion representation.\nAlmost all hourly guest-facing Cast Members work under union contracts. The most recent contract was negotiated and put in effect in 2023 and is valid through 2027, setting the starting hourly rate for part-time and full-time Cast at 17 dollars per hour, with additional premiums available for select roles. Union membership is offered to all Cast eligible at the start of employment. Each staff location on property has an official designated as shop steward, who bargains with Disney leadership when needed to defend the rights designated within the contract.\nAttendance.\nIn the first year of opening, the park attracted 10,712,991 visitors. In 2018, the resort's four theme parks all ranked in the top 9 on the list of the 25 most visited theme parks in the world: (1st) Magic Kingdom\u201420,859,000 visitors; (6th) Disney's Animal Kingdom\u201413,750,000 visitors; (7th) EPCOT\u201412,444,000 visitors; and (9th) Disney's Hollywood Studios\u201411,258,000 visitors. By October 2020, maximum Disney World attendance was still allowed to only remain at 25% capacity due to the COVID-19 pandemic. A recent study found that reducing Magic Kingdom park capacity to 25% would result in a 54.1% reduction in annual attendance. This capacity limit causes less annual revenue, and may lower the number of visitors to the Orlando region.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"template:sticky header/styles.css\"/&gt;\nOperations.\nTransportation.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Routemap/styles.css\"/&gt;\nThe Walt Disney World Resort is serviced by Disney Transport, a complimentary mass transportation system allowing guest access across the property. The fare-free system utilizes buses, monorails, gondola lifts, watercraft, and parking lot trams.\nThe Walt Disney World Monorail System provides free transportation at Walt Disney World; guests can board the monorail and travel between the Magic Kingdom and EPCOT, including select on-property resorts such as the Grand Floridian and the Polynesian Village. The system operates on three routes that interconnect at the Transportation and Ticket Center (TTC), adjacent to the Magic Kingdom's parking lot. Disney Transport owns a fleet of Disney-operated buses on the property, that is also complimentary for guests.\nA gondola lift system, dubbed Disney Skyliner, opened in 2019. The system's three lines connect Disney's Hollywood Studios and EPCOT with four resort hotels.\nDisney Transport also operates a fleet of watercraft, ranging in size from water taxis, up to the ferries that connect the Magic Kingdom to the Transportation and Ticket Center. Disney Transport is also responsible for maintaining the fleet of parking lot trams that are used for shuttling visitors between the various theme park parking lots and their respective main entrances.\nIn addition to its free transportation methods, in conjunction with Lyft, Walt Disney World also offers a vehicle for hire service for a fee. The Minnie Van Service are Chevy Traverses dressed in a Minnie Mouse red-and-white polka dot design that can accommodate up to six people and have two carseats available to anyone that is within the Walt Disney World Resort limits. Cast members can install the car seats. Some of the unique advantages that the Minnie Van Service offers over a normal ride share is the ability to be dropped off in the Magic Kingdom bus loop (instead of at the TTC like the other ride shares) and being able to ride to any point in Fort Wilderness.\nEnergy use.\nWalt Disney World requires an estimated of electricity annually, costing the company nearly $100 million in annual energy consumption. In addition to relying primarily on fossil fuels and nuclear energy from the state's power grid, Walt Disney World has two solar energy facilities on property; a Mickey Mouse-shaped solar panel farm near EPCOT, and a facility near Disney's Animal Kingdom. The larger facility produces enough solar energy to provide electricity to two of the resort's theme parks. The sites are operated by Duke Energy and the Central Florida Tourism Oversight District, respectively.\nThe entire Disney Transport bus fleet uses R50 renewable diesel fuel, obtained from used cooking oil and non-consumable food waste from the resort.\nSelf-Government and security.\nDisney's security personnel are generally dressed in typical security guard uniforms, though some of the personnel are dressed as tourists in plain clothes. Since September 11, 2001, uniformed security has been stationed outside each Disney park in Florida to search guests' bags as they enter the parks. Starting April 3, 2017, bag checkpoints have been placed at Magic Kingdom's resort monorail entryways and the Transportation and Ticket Center's ferry entry points prior to embarkation as well as the walkway from Disney's Contemporary Resort. Guests arriving at the Transportation and Ticket Center by tram or tour bus will be screened at the former tram boarding areas. Guests arriving by Disney Resort hotel bus or Minnie Van have their own bag check just outside the bus stops. Guests arriving via Magic Kingdom Resort boat launch are bag checked on the arrival dock outside Magic Kingdom.\nThe land where Walt Disney World resides is part of the Central Florida Tourism Oversight District (CFTOD), known until 2023 as the Reedy Creek Improvement District (RCID), a governing jurisdiction created in May 1967 by the State of Florida at the request of Disney. CFTOD provides 911 services, fire, environmental protection, building code enforcement, utilities and road maintenance, but does not provide law enforcement services. The approximately 800 security staff are instead considered employees of the Walt Disney Company. Arrests and citations are issued by the Florida Highway Patrol along with the Orange County and Osceola County sheriffs deputies who patrol the roads. Disney security does maintain a fleet of security vans equipped with flares, traffic cones, and chalk commonly used by police officers. These security personnel are charged with traffic control by the CFTOD and may only issue personnel violation notices to Disney and CFTOD employees, not the general public.\nDespite the appearance of the uniformed security personnel, they are not considered a legal law enforcement agency. Disney and the Reedy Creek Improvement District were sued for access to Disney Security records by Bob and Kathy Sipkema following the death of their son at the resort in 1994. The court characterized Disney security as a \"night watchman\" service, not a law enforcement agency, meaning it is not subject to Florida's open records laws. An appeals court later upheld the lower court's ruling.\nIn late 2015, Disney confirmed the addition of randomized secondary screenings and dogs trained to detect body-worn explosives within parks, in addition to metal detectors at entrances. It has also increased the number of uniformed security personnel at Walt Disney World and Disneyland properties.\nDisney Security personnel in Florida have investigated traffic accidents and issued accident reports. The forms used by Disney Security may be confused with official, government forms by some.\nThe Orange County Sheriff maintains an office on Disney property, but this is primarily to process guests accused of shoplifting by Disney security personnel.\nAlthough the scattering of ashes on Disney property is illegal, \"The Wall Street Journal\" reported in October 2018 that Walt Disney World parks were becoming a popular spot for families to scatter the ashes of loved ones, with The Haunted Mansion at Magic Kingdom being the favorite location. The practice is unlawful and prohibited on Disney property, and anyone spreading cremated remains is escorted from the park.\nOn April 22, 2022, the Walt Disney Company's self-governing authority of all the area surrounding Walt Disney World came to an end after Florida Governor Ron DeSantis signed into law legislation requiring Walt Disney World's Reedy Creek Improvement District to come under the legal jurisdiction of the state of Florida on June 1, 2023.\nCorporate culture.\nWalt Disney World's corporate culture uses jargon based on theatrical terminology. For example, park visitors are always \"guests\", employees are called \"Cast Members\", rides are \"attractions\" or \"experiences\", cast members costumed as famous Disney characters in a way that does not cover their faces are known as \"face characters\", jobs are \"roles\", and public and nonpublic areas are respectively labeled \"onstage\" and \"backstage\".\nClosures.\nWalt Disney World has had 13 unscheduled closures, 11 of which have been due to hurricanes:\nLike its sister resort, parks at the resort may close early to accommodate various special events, such as special press events, tour groups, VIP groups, and private parties. It is common for a corporation to rent entire parks for the evening. In such cases, special passes are issued which are valid for admission to all rides and attractions. At the ticket booths and on published schedules, the guests are notified of the early closures. Then, cast members announce that the parks are closing, sometime before the private event starts, and clear the parks of guests who do not have the special passes.\nIn October 2020, it was revealed that full capacity attendance was still not permitted, following the COVID-19 closure which occurred earlier in the year. In July 2021, Disney World announced that all its staff workers in the United States would have to be fully vaccinated against COVID-19 to return to work. It also announced that those who are unvaccinated would have a period of time to get their shots and aimed to return to full capacity for people who are immunized.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

In the form of an implication, this can be expressed as: \"If something is a raven, then it is black.\"\nVia contraposition, this statement is equivalent to:\n (2) \"If something is not black, then it is not a raven.\"\nIn all circumstances where (2) is true, (1) is also true\u2014and likewise, in all circumstances where (2) is false (i.e., if a world is imagined in which something that was not black yet was a raven existed), (1) is also false.\nGiven a general statement such as \"all ravens are black\", a form of the same statement that refers to a specific observable instance of the general class would typically be considered to constitute evidence for that general statement. For example,\n (3) \"My pet raven is black.\"\nis evidence supporting the hypothesis that \"all ravens are black\".\nThe paradox arises when this same process is applied to statement (2). On sighting a green apple, one can observe:\n (4) \"This green apple is not black, and it is not a raven.\"\nBy the same reasoning, this statement is evidence that (2) \"if something is not black then it is not a raven.\" But since (as above) this statement is logically equivalent to (1) \"all ravens are black\", it follows that the sight of a green apple is evidence supporting the notion that all ravens are black. This conclusion seems paradoxical because it implies that information has been gained about ravens by looking at an apple.\nProposed resolutions.\nNicod's criterion says that only observations of ravens should affect one's view as to whether all ravens are black. Observing more instances of black ravens should support the view, observing white or coloured ravens should contradict it, and observations of non-ravens should not have any influence.\nHempel's equivalence condition states that when a proposition, X, provides evidence in favor of another proposition Y, then X also provides evidence in favor of any proposition that is logically equivalent to Y.\nThe paradox shows that Nicod's criterion and Hempel's equivalence condition are not mutually consistent. A resolution to the paradox must reject at least one out of:\nA satisfactory resolution should also explain \"why\" there naively appears to be a paradox. Solutions that accept the paradoxical conclusion can do this by presenting a proposition that we intuitively know to be false but that is easily confused with (PC), while solutions that reject (EC) or (NC) should present a proposition that we intuitively know to be true but that is easily confused with (EC) or (NC).\nAccepting non-ravens as relevant.\nAlthough this conclusion of the paradox seems counter-intuitive, some approaches accept that observations of (coloured) non-ravens can in fact constitute valid evidence in support for hypotheses about (the universal blackness of) ravens.\nHempel's resolution.\nHempel himself accepted the paradoxical conclusion, arguing that the reason the result appears paradoxical is that we possess prior information without which the observation of a non-black non-raven would indeed provide evidence that all ravens are black.\nHe illustrates this with the example of the generalization \"All sodium salts burn yellow\", and asks us to consider the observation that occurs when somebody holds a piece of pure ice in a colorless flame that does not turn yellow:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;This result would confirm the assertion, \"Whatever does not burn yellow is not sodium salt\", and consequently, by virtue of the equivalence condition, it would confirm the original formulation. Why does this impress us as paradoxical? The reason becomes clear when we compare the previous situation with the case of an experiment where an object whose chemical constitution is as yet unknown to us is held into a flame and fails to turn it yellow, and where subsequent analysis reveals it to contain no sodium salt. This outcome, we should no doubt agree, is what was to be expected on the basis of the hypothesis ... thus the data here obtained constitute confirming evidence for the hypothesis. ...\nIn the seemingly paradoxical cases of confirmation, we are often not actually judging the relation of the given evidence, E alone to the hypothesis H ... we tacitly introduce a comparison of H with a body of evidence which consists of E in conjunction with an additional amount of information which we happen to have at our disposal; in our illustration, this information includes the knowledge (1) that the substance used in the experiment is ice, and (2) that ice contains no sodium salt. If we assume this additional information as given, then, of course, the outcome of the experiment can add no strength to the hypothesis under consideration. But if we are careful to avoid this tacit reference to additional knowledge ... the paradoxes vanish.\nStandard Bayesian solution.\nOne of the most popular proposed resolutions is to accept the conclusion that the observation of a green apple provides evidence that all ravens are black but to argue that the amount of confirmation provided is very small, due to the large discrepancy between the number of ravens and the number of non-black objects. According to this resolution, the conclusion appears paradoxical because we intuitively estimate the amount of evidence provided by the observation of a green apple to be zero, when it is in fact non-zero but extremely small.\nI. J. Good's presentation of this argument in 1960 is perhaps the best known, and variations of the argument have been popular ever since, although it had been presented in 1958 and early forms of the argument appeared as early as 1940.\nGood's argument involves calculating the weight of evidence provided by the observation of a black raven or a white shoe in favor of the hypothesis that all the ravens in a collection of objects are black. The weight of evidence is the logarithm of the Bayes factor, which in this case is simply the factor by which the odds of the hypothesis changes when the observation is made. The argument goes as follows:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nMany of the proponents of this resolution and variants of it have been advocates of Bayesian probability, and it is now commonly called the Bayesian Solution, although, as Chihara observes, \"there is no such thing as \"the\" Bayesian solution. There are many different 'solutions' that Bayesians have put forward using Bayesian techniques.\" Noteworthy approaches using Bayesian techniques (some of which accept !PC and instead reject NC) include Earman, Eells, Gibson, Hosiasson-Lindenbaum, Howson and Urbach, Mackie, and Hintikka, who claims that his approach is \"more Bayesian than the so-called 'Bayesian solution' of the same paradox\". Bayesian approaches that make use of Carnap's theory of inductive inference include Humburg, Maher, and Fitelson &amp; Hawthorne. Vranas introduced the term \"Standard Bayesian Solution\" to avoid confusion.\nCarnap approach.\nMaher accepts the paradoxical conclusion, and refines it:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;A non-raven (of whatever colour) confirms that all ravens are black because\nTo reach (ii), he appeals to Carnap's theory of inductive probability, which is (from the Bayesian point of view) a way of assigning prior probabilities that naturally implements induction. According to Carnap's theory, the posterior probability, formula_1, that an object, formula_2, will have a predicate, formula_3, after the evidence formula_4 has been observed, is:\nformula_5\nwhere formula_6 is the initial probability that formula_2 has the predicate formula_3; formula_9 is the number of objects that have been examined (according to the available evidence formula_4); formula_11 is the number of examined objects that turned out to have the predicate formula_3, and formula_13 is a constant that measures resistance to generalization.\nIf formula_13 is close to zero, formula_1 will be very close to one after a single observation of an object that turned out to have the predicate formula_3, while if formula_13 is much larger than formula_9, formula_1 will be very close to formula_6 regardless of the fraction of observed objects that had the predicate formula_3.\nUsing this Carnapian approach, Maher identifies a proposition we intuitively (and correctly) know is false, but easily confuse with the paradoxical conclusion. The proposition in question is that observing non-ravens tells us about the color of ravens. While this is intuitively false and is also false according to Carnap's theory of induction, observing non-ravens (according to that same theory) causes us to reduce our estimate of the total number of ravens, and thereby reduces the estimated number of possible counterexamples to the rule that all ravens are black.\nHence, from the Bayesian-Carnapian point of view, the observation of a non-raven does not tell us anything about the color of ravens, but it tells us about the prevalence of ravens, and supports \"All ravens are black\" by reducing our estimate of the number of ravens that might not be black.\nRole of background knowledge.\nMuch of the discussion of the paradox in general and the Bayesian approach in particular has centred on the relevance of background knowledge. Surprisingly, Maher shows that, for a large class of possible configurations of background knowledge, the observation of a non-black non-raven provides \"exactly the same\" amount of confirmation as the observation of a black raven. The configurations of background knowledge that he considers are those that are provided by a \"sample proposition\", namely a proposition that is a conjunction of atomic propositions, each of which ascribes a single predicate to a single individual, with no two atomic propositions involving the same individual. Thus, a proposition of the form \"A is a black raven and B is a white shoe\" can be considered a sample proposition by taking \"black raven\" and \"white shoe\" to be predicates.\nMaher's proof appears to contradict the result of the Bayesian argument, which was that the observation of a non-black non-raven provides much less evidence than the observation of a black raven. The reason is that the background knowledge that Good and others use can not be expressed in the form of a sample proposition \u2013 in particular, variants of the standard Bayesian approach often suppose (as Good did in the argument quoted above) that the total numbers of ravens, non-black objects and/or the total number of objects, are known quantities. Maher comments that, \"The reason we think there are more non-black things than ravens is because that has been true of the things we have observed to date. Evidence of this kind can be represented by a sample proposition. But ... given any sample proposition as background evidence, a non-black non-raven confirms A just as strongly as a black raven does ... Thus my analysis suggests that this response to the paradox [i.e. the Standard Bayesian one] cannot be correct.\"\nFitelson &amp; Hawthorne examined the conditions under which the observation of a non-black non-raven provides less evidence than the observation of a black raven. They show that, if formula_2 is an object selected at random, formula_23 is the proposition that the object is black, and formula_24 is the proposition that the object is a raven, then the condition:\nformula_25\nis sufficient for the observation of a non-black non-raven to provide less evidence than the observation of a black raven. Here, a line over a proposition indicates the logical negation of that proposition.\nThis condition does not tell us \"how large\" the difference in the evidence provided is, but a later calculation in the same paper shows that the weight of evidence provided by a black raven exceeds that provided by a non-black non-raven by about formula_26. This is equal to the amount of additional information (in bits, if the base of the logarithm is 2) that is provided when a raven of unknown color is discovered to be black, given the hypothesis that not all ravens are black.\nFitelson &amp; Hawthorne explain that:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Ra\\overline{H})&lt;/math&gt; may be somewhere around 0.9 or 0.95; so formula_27 is somewhere around 1.11 or 1.05. Thus, it may appear that a single instance of a black raven does not yield much more support than would a non-black non-raven. However, under plausible conditions it can be shown that a sequence of formula_9 instances (i.e. of n black ravens, as compared to n non-black non-ravens) yields a ratio of likelihood ratios on the order of formula_29, which blows up significantly for large formula_9.\nThe authors point out that their analysis is completely consistent with the supposition that a non-black non-raven provides an extremely small amount of evidence although they do not attempt to prove it; they merely calculate the difference between the amount of evidence that a black raven provides and the amount of evidence that a non-black non-raven provides.\nDisputing the induction from positive instances.\nSome approaches for resolving the paradox focus on the inductive step. They dispute whether observation of a particular instance (such as one black raven) is the kind of evidence that necessarily \"increases\" confidence in the general hypothesis (such as that ravens are always black).\nRed herring.\nGood gives an example of background knowledge with respect to which the observation of a black raven \"decreases\" the probability that all ravens are black:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Suppose that we know we are in one or other of two worlds, and the hypothesis, H, under consideration is that all the ravens in our world are black. We know in advance that in one world there are a hundred black ravens, no non-black ravens, and a million other birds; and that in the other world there are a thousand black ravens, one white raven, and a million other birds. A bird is selected equiprobably at random from all the birds in our world. It turns out to be a black raven. This is strong evidence ... that we are in the second world, wherein not all ravens are black.\nGood concludes that the white shoe is a \"red herring\": Sometimes even a black raven can constitute evidence \"against\" the hypothesis that all ravens are black, so the fact that the observation of a white shoe can support it is not surprising and not worth attention. Nicod's criterion is false, according to Good, and so the paradoxical conclusion does not follow.\nHempel rejected this as a solution to the paradox, insisting that the proposition 'c is a raven and is black' must be considered \"by itself and without reference to any other information\", and pointing out that it \"was emphasized in section 5.2(b) of my article in \"Mind\" ... that the very appearance of paradoxicality in cases like that of the white shoe results in part from a failure to observe this maxim.\"\nThe question that then arises is whether the paradox is to be understood in the context of absolutely no background information (as Hempel suggests), or in the context of the background information that we actually possess regarding ravens and black objects, or with regard to all possible configurations of background information.\nGood had shown that, for some configurations of background knowledge, Nicod's criterion is false (provided that we are willing to equate \"inductively support\" with \"increase the probability of\" \u2013 see below). The possibility remained that, with respect to our actual configuration of knowledge, which is very different from Good's example, Nicod's criterion might still be true and so we could still reach the paradoxical conclusion. Hempel, on the other hand, insists our background knowledge itself is the red herring, and that we should consider induction with respect to a condition of perfect ignorance.\nGood's baby.\nIn his proposed resolution, Maher implicitly made use of the fact that the proposition \"All ravens are black\" is highly probable when it is highly probable that there are no ravens. Good had used this fact before to respond to Hempel's insistence that Nicod's criterion was to be understood to hold in the absence of background information:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;...\u00a0imagine an infinitely intelligent newborn baby having built-in neural circuits enabling him to deal with formal logic, English syntax, and subjective probability. He might now argue, after defining a raven in detail, that it is extremely unlikely that there are any ravens, and therefore it is extremely likely that all ravens are black, that is, that formula_31 is true. \"On the other hand,\" he goes on to argue, \"if there are ravens, then there is a reasonable chance that they are of a variety of colours. Therefore, if I were to discover that even a black raven exists I would consider formula_31 to be less probable than it was initially.\"\nThis, according to Good, is as close as one can reasonably expect to get to a condition of perfect ignorance, and it appears that Nicod's condition is still false. Maher made Good's argument more precise by using Carnap's theory of induction to formalize the notion that if there is one raven, then it is likely that there are many.\nMaher's argument considers a universe of exactly two objects, each of which is very unlikely to be a raven (a one in a thousand chance) and reasonably unlikely to be black (a one in ten chance). Using Carnap's formula for induction, he finds that the probability that all ravens are black decreases from 0.9985 to 0.8995 when it is discovered that one of the two objects is a black raven.\nMaher concludes that not only is the paradoxical conclusion true, but that Nicod's criterion is false in the absence of background knowledge (except for the knowledge that the number of objects in the universe is two and that ravens are less likely than black things).\nDistinguished predicates.\nQuine argued that the solution to the paradox lies in the recognition that certain predicates, which he called natural kinds, have a distinguished status with respect to induction. This can be illustrated with Nelson Goodman's example of the predicate grue. An object is grue if it is blue before (say) 2025 and green afterwards. Clearly, we expect objects that were blue before 2025 to remain blue afterwards, but we do not expect the objects that were found to be grue before 2025 to be blue after 2025, since after 2025 they would be green. Quine's explanation is that \"blue\" is a natural kind; a privileged predicate we can use for induction, while \"grue\" is not a natural kind and using induction with it leads to error.\nThis suggests a resolution to the paradox \u2013 Nicod's criterion is true for natural kinds, such as \"blue\" and \"black\", but is false for artificially contrived predicates, such as \"grue\" or \"non-raven\". The paradox arises, according to this resolution, because we implicitly interpret Nicod's criterion as applying to all predicates when in fact it only applies to natural kinds.\nAnother approach, which favours specific predicates over others, was taken by Hintikka. Hintikka was motivated to find a Bayesian approach to the paradox that did not make use of knowledge about the relative frequencies of ravens and black things. Arguments concerning relative frequencies, he contends, cannot always account for the perceived irrelevance of evidence consisting of observations of objects of type A for the purposes of learning about objects of type not-A.\nHis argument can be illustrated by rephrasing the paradox using predicates other than \"raven\" and \"black\". For example, \"All men\nare tall\" is equivalent to \"All short people are women\", and so observing that a randomly selected person is a short woman should provide evidence that all men are tall. Despite the fact that we lack background knowledge to indicate that there are dramatically fewer men than short people, we still find ourselves inclined to reject the conclusion. Hintikka's example is as follows: \"a generalization like 'no material bodies are infinitely divisible' seems to be completely unaffected by questions concerning immaterial entities, independently of what one thinks of the relative frequencies of material and immaterial entities in one's universe of discourse.\"\nHis solution is to introduce an \"order\" into the set of predicates. When the logical system is equipped with this order, it is possible to restrict the \"scope\" of a generalization such as \"All ravens are black\" so that it applies to ravens only and not to non-black things, since the order privileges ravens over non-black things. As he puts it:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nRejections of Hempel's equivalence condition.\nSome approaches for the resolution of the paradox reject Hempel's equivalence condition. That is, they may not consider evidence supporting the statement \"all non-black objects are non-ravens\" to necessarily support logically-equivalent statements such as \"all ravens are black\".\nSelective confirmation.\nScheffler and Goodman took an approach to the paradox that incorporates Karl Popper's view that scientific hypotheses are never really confirmed, only falsified.\nThe approach begins by noting that the observation of a black raven does not prove that \"All ravens are black\" but it falsifies the contrary hypothesis, \"No ravens are black\". A non-black non-raven, on the other hand, is consistent with both \"All ravens are black\" and with \"No ravens are black\". As the authors put it:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;... the statement that all ravens are black is not merely \"satisfied\" by evidence of a black raven but is \"favored\" by such evidence, since a black raven disconfirms the contrary statement that all ravens are not black, i.e. satisfies its denial. A black raven, in other words, satisfies the hypothesis \"that all ravens are black rather than not:\" it thus selectively confirms \"that all ravens are black\".\nSelective confirmation violates the equivalence condition since a black raven selectively confirms \"All ravens are black\" but not \"All non-black things are non-ravens\".\nProbabilistic or non-probabilistic induction.\nScheffler and Goodman's concept of selective confirmation is an example of an interpretation of \"provides evidence in favor of...\" which does not coincide with \"increase the probability of...\" This must be a general feature of all resolutions that reject the equivalence condition, since logically equivalent propositions must always have the same probability.\nIt is impossible for the observation of a black raven to increase the probability of the proposition \"All ravens are black\" without causing exactly the same change to the probability that \"All non-black things are non-ravens\". If an observation inductively supports the former but not the latter, then \"inductively support\" must refer to something other than changes in the probabilities of propositions. A possible loophole is to interpret \"All\" as \"Nearly all\" \u2013 \"Nearly all ravens are black\" is not equivalent to \"Nearly all non-black things are non-ravens\", and these propositions can have very different probabilities.\nThis raises the broader question of the relation of probability theory to inductive reasoning. Karl Popper argued that probability theory alone cannot account for induction. His argument involves splitting a hypothesis, formula_31, into a part that is deductively entailed by the evidence, formula_4, and another part. This can be done in two ways.\nFirst, consider the splitting:\nformula_35\nwhere formula_36, formula_37 and formula_38 are probabilistically independent: formula_39 and so on. The condition that is necessary for such a splitting of H and E to be possible is formula_40, that is, that formula_31 is probabilistically supported by formula_4.\nPopper's observation is that the part, formula_37, of formula_31 that receives support from formula_4 actually follows deductively from formula_4, while the part of formula_31 that does not follow deductively from formula_4 receives no support at all from formula_4 \u2013 that is, formula_50.\nSecond, the splitting:\nformula_51\nseparates formula_31 into formula_53, which as Popper says, \"is the logically strongest part of formula_31 (or of the content of formula_31) that follows [deductively] from formula_4\", and formula_57, which, he says, \"contains all of formula_31 that goes beyond formula_4\". He continues:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Does formula_4, in this case, provide any support for the factor formula_57, which in the presence of formula_4 is alone needed to obtain formula_31? The answer is: No. It never does. Indeed, formula_4 countersupports formula_57 unless either formula_66 of all P's are Q, formula_67, whereas a test of \"All non-Q's are non-P\" requires reference to some statistical alternative of the form formula_68 of all non-Q's are non-P, formula_67. But these two sets of possible alternatives are different ... Thus one could have a test of formula_31 without having a test of its contrapositive.\nRejecting material implication.\nThe following propositions all imply one another: \"Every object is either black or not a raven\", \"Every raven is black\", and \"Every non-black object is a non-raven.\" They are therefore, by definition, logically equivalent. However, the three propositions have different domains: the first proposition says something about \"every object\", while the second says something about \"every raven\".\nThe first proposition is the only one whose domain of quantification is unrestricted (\"all objects\"), so this is the only one that can be expressed in first-order logic. It is logically equivalent to:\nformula_71\nand also to\nformula_72\nwhere formula_73 indicates the material conditional, according to which \"If formula_36 then formula_37\" can be understood to mean \"formula_37 or formula_77\".\nIt has been argued by several authors that material implication does not fully capture the meaning of \"If formula_36 then formula_37\" (see the paradoxes of material implication). \"For every object, formula_80, formula_80 is either black or not a raven\" is \"true\" when there are no ravens. It is because of this that \"All ravens are black\" is regarded as true when there are no ravens. Furthermore, the arguments that Good and Maher used to criticize Nicod's criterion (see , above) relied on this fact \u2013 that \"All ravens are black\" is highly probable when it is highly probable that there are no ravens.\nTo say that all ravens are black in the absence of any ravens is an empty statement. It refers to nothing. \"All ravens are white\" is equally relevant and true, if this statement is considered to have any truth or relevance.\nSome approaches to the paradox have sought to find other ways of interpreting \"If formula_36 then formula_37\" and \"All formula_36 are formula_37,\" which would eliminate the perceived equivalence between \"All ravens are black\" and \"All non-black things are non-ravens.\"\nOne such approach involves introducing a many-valued logic according to which \"If formula_36 then formula_37\" has the truth value formula_88, meaning \"Indeterminate\" or \"Inappropriate\" when formula_36 is false. In such a system, contraposition is not automatically allowed: \"If formula_36 then formula_37\" is not equivalent to \"If formula_92 then formula_77\". Consequently, \"All ravens are black\" is not equivalent to \"All non-black things are non-ravens\".\nIn this system, when contraposition occurs, the modality of the conditional involved changes from the indicative (\"If that piece of butter \"has been\" heated to 32\u00a0\u00b0C then it \"has\" melted\") to the counterfactual (\"If that piece of butter \"had been\" heated to 32\u00a0\u00b0C then it \"would have\" melted\"). According to this argument, this removes the alleged equivalence that is necessary to conclude that yellow cows can inform us about ravens:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nDiffering results of accepting the hypotheses.\nSeveral commentators have observed that the propositions \"All ravens are black\" and \"All non-black things are non-ravens\" suggest different procedures for testing the hypotheses. E.g. Good writes:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;As propositions the two statements are logically equivalent. But they have a different psychological effect on the experimenter. If he is asked to test whether all ravens are black he will look for a raven and then decide whether it is black. But if he is asked to test whether all non-black things are non-ravens he may look for a non-black object and then decide whether it is a raven.\nMore recently, it has been suggested that \"All ravens are black\" and \"All non-black things are non-ravens\" can have different effects when \"accepted\". The argument considers situations in which the total numbers or prevalences of ravens and black objects are unknown, but estimated. When the hypothesis \"All ravens are black\" is accepted, according to the argument, the estimated number of black objects increases, while the estimated number of ravens does not change.\nIt can be illustrated by considering the situation of two people who have identical information regarding ravens and black objects, and who have identical estimates of the numbers of ravens and black objects. For concreteness, suppose that there are 100 objects overall, and, according to the information available to the people involved, each object is just as likely to be a non-raven as it is to be a raven, and just as likely to be black as it is to be non-black:\nformula_94\nand the propositions formula_95 are independent for different objects formula_2, formula_97 and so on. Then the estimated number of ravens is 50; the estimated number of black things is 50; the estimated number of black ravens is 25, and the estimated number of non-black ravens (counterexamples to the hypotheses) is 25.\nOne of the people performs a statistical test (e.g. a Neyman-Pearson test or the comparison of the accumulated weight of evidence to a threshold) of the hypothesis that \"All ravens are black\", while the other tests the hypothesis that \"All non-black objects\nare non-ravens\". For simplicity, suppose that the evidence used for the test has nothing to do with the collection of 100 objects dealt with here. If the first person accepts the hypothesis that \"All ravens are black\" then, according to the argument, about 50 objects whose colors were previously in doubt (the ravens) are now thought to be black, while nothing different is thought about the remaining objects (the non-ravens). Consequently, he should estimate the number of black ravens at 50, the number of black non-ravens at 25 and the number of non-black non-ravens at 25. By specifying these changes, this argument \"explicitly\" restricts the domain of \"All ravens are black\" to ravens.\nOn the other hand, if the second person accepts the hypothesis that \"All non-black objects are non-ravens\", then the approximately 50 non-black objects about which it was uncertain whether each was a raven, will be thought to be non-ravens. At the same time, nothing different will be thought about the approximately 50 remaining objects (the black objects). Consequently, he should estimate the number of black ravens at 25, the number of black non-ravens at 25 and the number of non-black non-ravens at 50. According to this argument, since the two people disagree about their estimates after they have accepted the different hypotheses, accepting \"All ravens are black\" is not equivalent to accepting \"All non-black things are non-ravens\"; accepting the former means estimating more things to be black, while accepting the latter involves estimating more things to be non-ravens. Correspondingly, the argument goes, the former requires as evidence ravens that turn out to be black and the latter requires non-black things that turn out to be non-ravens.\nExistential presuppositions.\nA number of authors have argued that propositions of the form \"All formula_36 are formula_37\" presuppose that there are objects that are formula_36. This analysis has been applied to the raven paradox:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;... formula_101: \"All ravens are black\" and formula_102: \"All nonblack things are nonravens\" are not \"strictly equivalent\" ... due to their different existential presuppositions. Moreover, although formula_101 and formula_102 describe the same regularity \u2013 the nonexistence of nonblack ravens \u2013 they have different logical forms. The two hypotheses have different senses and incorporate different procedures for testing the regularity they describe.\nA modified logic can take account of existential presuppositions using the presuppositional operator, '*'. For example,\nformula_105\ncan denote \"All ravens are black\" while indicating that it is ravens and not non-black objects which are presupposed to exist in this example.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;... the logical form of each hypothesis distinguishes it with respect to its recommended type of supporting evidence: the possibly true substitution instances of each hypothesis relate to different types of objects. The fact that the two hypotheses incorporate different kinds of testing procedures is expressed in the formal language by prefixing the operator '*' to a different predicate. The presuppositional operator thus serves as a relevance operator as well. It is prefixed to the predicate 'formula_80 is a raven' in formula_101 because the objects relevant to the testing procedure incorporated in \"All raven are black\" include only ravens; it is prefixed to the predicate 'formula_80 is nonblack', in formula_102, because the objects relevant to the testing procedure incorporated in \"All nonblack things are nonravens\" include only nonblack things. ... Using Fregean terms: whenever their presuppositions hold, the two hypotheses have the same referent (truth-value), but different senses; that is, they express two different ways to determine that truth-value.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Historically, its watershed has reached as far north as south-central Oregon where the now, primarily, endorheic (closed) Goose Lake rarely experiences southerly outflow into the Pit River, the most northerly tributary of the Sacramento.\nThe Sacramento and its wide natural floodplain were once abundant in fish and other aquatic creatures, notably one of the southernmost large runs of chinook salmon in North America. For about 12,000 years, humans have depended on the vast natural resources of the watershed, which had one of the densest Native American populations in California. The river has provided a route for trade and travel since ancient times. Hundreds of tribes sharing regional customs and traditions have inhabited the Sacramento Valley, first coming into contact with European explorers in the late 1700s. The Spanish explorer Gabriel Moraga named the river \"Rio de los Sacramentos\" in 1808, later shortened and anglicized into \"Sacramento\".\nIn the 19th century, gold was discovered on a tributary of the Sacramento River, starting the California Gold Rush and an enormous population influx to the state. Overland trails such as the California Trail and Siskiyou Trail guided hundreds of thousands of people to the gold fields. By the late part of the century mining had ceased to be a major part of the economy, and many immigrants turned to farming and ranching. Many populous communities were established along the Sacramento River, including the state capital of Sacramento. Intensive agriculture and mining contributed to pollution in the Sacramento River, and significant changes to the river's hydrology and environment.\nSince the 1950s the watershed has been intensely developed for water supply and the generation of hydroelectric power. Today, large dams impound the river and almost all of its major tributaries. The Sacramento River is used heavily for irrigation and serves much of Central and Southern California through the canals of giant state and federal water projects. While it is now providing water to over half of California's population and supporting the most productive agricultural area in the nation, these changes have left the Sacramento greatly modified from its natural state and have caused the decline of its once-abundant fisheries.\nCourse.\nUpper river.\nThe Sacramento River originates in the mountains and plateaus of far northern California as three major waterways that flow into Shasta Lake: the Upper Sacramento River, McCloud River and Pit River. The Upper Sacramento begins near Mount Shasta, at the confluence of North, Middle and South Forks in the Trinity Mountains of Siskiyou County. It flows east into a small reservoir, Lake Siskiyou, before turning south. The river flows through a canyon for about , past Dunsmuir and Castella, before emptying into Shasta Lake near Lakehead in Shasta County. The McCloud River rises on the east slope of Mount Shasta and flows south for through the southern Cascade Range, roughly parallel to the Upper Sacramento, eventually to reach the McCloud Arm of Shasta Lake.\nThe Pit River, by far the largest of the three, begins in Modoc County in the northeastern corner of California. Draining a vast and remote volcanic highlands area, it flows southwest for nearly before emptying into Shasta Lake near Montgomery Creek. Goose Lake, straddling the Oregon\u2013California border, occasionally overflows into the Pit River during wet years, although this has not happened since 1881. The Goose Lake watershed is the only part of the Sacramento River basin extending into another state. Unlike most California rivers, the Pit and the McCloud Rivers are predominantly spring-fed, ensuring a large and consistent flow in even the driest of summers. At the lower end of Shasta Lake is Shasta Dam, which impounds the Sacramento River for flood control, irrigation and hydropower generation. Before the construction of Shasta Dam, the McCloud River emptied into the Pit River, which joined the Sacramento near the former mining town of Kennett, submerged when Shasta Lake was filled. The Pit River Bridge, which carries Interstate 5 and the Union Pacific Railroad over the reservoir, is structurally the highest double-decked bridge in the United States (although most of the bridge piers are submerged under Shasta Lake when the reservoir is full). The Upper Sacramento River canyon also provides the route for I-5 and the railroad between Lakehead and Mount Shasta.\nSacramento Valley.\nBelow Shasta Dam the Sacramento River enters the foothills region of the northern Sacramento Valley. It flows through Keswick Dam, where it receives about of water per year diverted from the Trinity River. It then swings east through Redding, the largest city of the Shasta Cascade region, and turns southeast, entering Tehama County. East of Cottonwood it receives Cottonwood Creek \u2013 the largest undammed tributary \u2013 from the west, then Battle Creek a short distance downstream. Below Battle Creek it carves its last gorge, Iron Canyon, emerging from the hills at Red Bluff, where a pumping station (which replaced the Red Bluff Diversion Dam) removes water for irrigation. Beyond Red Bluff the river reaches the low floodplain of the Sacramento Valley, receiving Mill Creek from the east and Thomes Creek from the west near Los Molinos, then Deer Creek from the east near Vina.\nSoutheast of Corning, the Sacramento forms the boundary of Tehama County to the west and Butte County to the east. A few miles downstream it forms the border of Butte County and Glenn County to the west. Stony Creek joins from the west in Glenn County, near Hamilton City and about west of Chico. The river then forms the Glenn\u2013Colusa County line for a short distance before crossing entirely into Colusa County. It passes by the Sutter Buttes, a group of volcanic hills that rise abruptly from the middle of the Sacramento Valley, where it receives Butte Creek from the east at Colusa. Below Colusa the river flows south-southeast, forming the border of Colusa County and Sutter County to the east.\nAbout further downstream, the Sacramento River reaches the Tisdale Weir. During floods, water overtops the weir and flows east into the Sutter Bypass, the first of two major bypass channels that temporarily store and move floodwaters downstream to reduce pressure on the main channel of the Sacramento. The Sacramento River and the Sutter Bypass flow parallel for over , rejoining on the border of Sutter County and Yolo County near Knights Landing. The Feather River, the largest tributary of the Sacramento, joins from the east at Verona directly below the Sutter Bypass. A second flood control structure, the Fremont Weir, diverts flood waters from both the Sacramento and Feather Rivers into the Yolo Bypass, which parallels the Sacramento River down the west side of the valley. Cache Creek and Putah Creek, two major tributaries which formerly joined the Sacramento River from the west, are now intercepted by the Yolo Bypass via man-made channels. The main channel of the Sacramento flows south, forming the Yolo\u2013Sacramento County line.\nLower river.\nAs the river continues south it approaches the Sacramento metro area, the largest population center in the watershed. Sacramento International Airport is located on the east bank of the river near Fremont. Near downtown Sacramento it receives the American River from the east, then passes under the historic Tower Bridge and Interstate 80 Business. The California State Capitol sits less than east of the river where the Tower Bridge crosses it. Shortly downstream, the Port of Sacramento is located on the west side of the Sacramento, connected to the river by a lock. The Sacramento River Deep Water Ship Channel provides access to the port from the Pacific, bypassing about of the winding lower Sacramento. The channel runs parallel to the Sacramento several miles to the west, and also forms the eastern boundary of the Yolo Bypass. The manually operated Sacramento Weir, located across from downtown Sacramento on the west side of the river, serves to relieve floodwater pressure from the American River by allowing it to drain west into the Yolo Bypass instead of continuing down the Sacramento River.\nDownstream of Sacramento, the river enters the Sacramento\u2013San Joaquin River Delta, a vast tidal estuary and inverted river delta of over which receives the entire run-off of the Central Valley, a region covering a third of California. The Sacramento is by far the largest contributor of fresh water to the Delta; in an average year, it accounts for more than 80\u00a0percent of the fresh water inflow. At Walnut Grove, the manmade Delta Cross Channel connects the Sacramento to the Mokelumne River channel, allowing a portion of the water to be pumped south toward Clifton Court Forebay, the receiving reservoir for the main CVP and State Water Project aqueducts which irrigate millions of acres and supply water to over 23\u00a0million people in the San Joaquin Valley, the San Francisco Bay Area and Greater Los Angeles. Although river levels are tidally influenced here and occasionally as far north as Verona, the water stays fresh in all but the driest years. Saltwater intrusion from the Pacific Ocean was one of the main reasons for the construction of the federal Central Valley Project (CVP), whose dams maintain a minimum flow in the Sacramento River to keep seawater at bay.\nBelow Rio Vista, the lower Sacramento River is rejoined by the Deep Water Ship Channel and the Yolo Bypass and curves southwest along the base of the Montezuma Hills, forming the border of Solano and Sacramento Counties. This part of the river is dredged for navigation by large oceangoing vessels and averages three-quarters of a mile (1.2\u00a0km) across. North of Antioch and Pittsburg, the Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers join at the head of Suisun Bay, marking the official end of both rivers. The combined waters flow west through Suisun Bay and the Carquinez Strait into San Pablo Bay and San Francisco Bay, joining the Pacific at the Golden Gate.\nDischarge.\nFollowing the Columbia River, the Sacramento is the largest river by discharge on the Pacific coast of the continental United States. The natural runoff of the river is per year, or about . Before dams were built on its tributaries, the river flooded up to during the rainy season, equal to the flow of the Mississippi River. Late summers of particularly dry years could see flows drop below . Large volumes of water are withdrawn from the Sacramento River for irrigation, industry and urban supplies. Annual depletions (water not returned to the river after use) are about for irrigation and for urban use. An additional is reserved for environmental uses, primarily to maintain a minimum fresh water outflow in the Delta to combat salinity.\nThe U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) has stream gauges on 25 locations along the Sacramento River, although not all of them are currently operational. The ones currently in operation are at Delta, California (near the source at Mount Shasta), at Keswick (near Redding), Colusa (about halfway down the river), Verona, and Freeport. The Freeport gauge, which sits just downstream of Sacramento, provides a relatively good metric of the annual outflow from the Sacramento River Basin. The average flow between 1949 and 2013 was . The maximum recorded flow was on February 19, 1986; the lowest was on October 15, 1977. Flow in the Yolo Bypass, a relief channel designed to carry a portion of the flood waters in order to protect the Sacramento area, is not measured by the Freeport gauge. A separate gauge on the bypass recorded an average throughput of between 1939 and 2013, mostly from December\u2013March. The highest recorded flow was on February 20, 1986. During the dry season of July through September, the bypass carries low to zero flow.\nAlthough the Sacramento River nominally begins near Mount Shasta, the true hydrological source of the Sacramento River system is the Pit River, which is by far the largest of the three rivers flowing into Shasta Lake. At the USGS Montgomery Creek gauge, the average flow of the Pit River was for the period 1966\u20132013. By comparison, the Sacramento River at Delta gauge, a few miles above Shasta Lake, recorded an average of for the period 1945\u20132013. The McCloud River had an average discharge of for the 1967\u20132013 period. Since the 1960s, the McCloud River flow has been reduced and the Pit River flow increased due to diversion of water for hydropower generation; however the total volume of water entering Shasta Lake remains the same. Before Shasta Dam was built, the volcanic springs feeding the Pit and McCloud Rivers provided the majority of river flow in dry summers when the Upper Sacramento and other tributaries slowed to a trickle.\nMonthly combined discharge of Sacramento River at Freeport and Yolo Bypass near Woodland (cfs)\nWatershed.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Routemap/styles.css\"/&gt;\nThe Sacramento River's watershed is the largest entirely in California, covering much of the northern part of the state. The endorheic (closed) Goose Lake drainage basin in southern Oregon, however, has been known to overflow into the Sacramento River system during particularly wet years. The Sacramento River basin generally lies between the Sierra Nevada and Cascade Range on the east and the Coast Ranges and Klamath Mountains in the west, although the part of the basin drained by the Pit River extends east of the Cascades. The Pit River, has the distinction of being one of three rivers that cut through the main crest of the Cascades; its headwaters rise on the western extreme of the Basin and Range Province, east of major Cascade volcanoes such as Mount Shasta and Lassen Peak. The other two are the Klamath River and Columbia River.\nBy discharge, it is the second-largest contiguous U.S. river draining into the Pacific, after only the Columbia River, which has almost ten times the flow of the Sacramento. The Colorado River, which reaches the Gulf of California just south of the US-Mexico border near the southeast part of the state, is far larger than the Sacramento in terms of length and drainage area but has a slightly smaller flow. The Sacramento, when combined with the Pit, is also one of the longest rivers in the United States entirely within one state\u2014after Alaska's Kuskokwim and Texas' Trinity.\nThe major drainage basins bordering that of the Sacramento are that of the Klamath in the north, the San Joaquin and Mokelumne to the south and the Eel River in the west. The Russian River also lies to the west and the endorheic (closed) Honey Lake and Eagle Lake basins to the north. On the east side are many endorheic watersheds of the Great Basin including the Truckee River and Carson River. Parts of the Sacramento watershed come very close to, but do not extend past, the border of California and Nevada.\nPhysiography.\nThe basin's diverse geography ranges from the glacier-carved, snowcapped peaks of the Sierra Nevada to the sea-level (and often lower) marshes and farmlands of the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta. The highest point is at Mount Shasta, a dormant stratovolcano near the headwaters of the Sacramento River. The Sierra Nevada peaks generally decrease in height from south to north\u2014from over in the headwaters of the American River near Lake Tahoe, to in Lassen County where they adjoin the Cascade Range. On the west side, the Coast Ranges are the opposite, increasing in height to almost in the north. The arid volcanic plateaus in the northeast, which are characterized by alternating hills and large sedimentary basins, typically lie at elevations of .\nMost of the Sacramento Valley is below in elevation; in its lower course, the Sacramento River drops only about per mile. Between the bajadas or alluvial slopes extending from the foothills of the Sierra Nevada and Coast Ranges, are the low floodplains of the Sacramento River. The river flows at an elevation somewhat higher than the surrounding terrain due to deposits of sediment over millennia that created raised banks (essentially natural levees). The banks separate the river from the lowlands to the east and west that once served as vast overflow basins during winter storms, creating large areas of seasonal wetlands. Since the 19th century, artificial levee systems have been constructed to enable farming in the fertile flood plain. Today there are of irrigated farmland in the Sacramento Valley. Due to the reduction of the floodplain area, the speed of flood flow in the Sacramento River has increased, creating a significant hazard for the farms and towns along its course. By the early 20th century engineers had realized not all the floodplains could be safely reclaimed, leading to the intentional creation of flood bypasses where development is limited to annual crops and recreational uses.\nFurther south, much of the delta region is actually below sea level: subsidence caused by wind erosion and intensive farming have caused the land in the delta to gradually sink since the late 19th century. Many of the delta islands would be underwater if not for the maintenance of the levees and pumps that keep them dry. Some of the \"islands\" are now up to below the adjacent channels and sloughs.\nLand use.\nThe Sacramento River watershed is home to about 2.8\u00a0million people; more than two-thirds live within the Sacramento metropolitan area. Other important cities are Chico, Redding, Davis and Woodland. The Sacramento River watershed covers all or most of Shasta, Tehama, Glenn, Butte, Plumas, Yuba, Sutter, Lake and Yolo Counties. It also extends into portions of Siskiyou, Modoc, Lassen, Lake (in Oregon), Sierra, Nevada, Placer, El Dorado, Sacramento, Solano and Contra Costa Counties. The river itself flows through Siskiyou, Shasta, Tehama, Butte, Glenn, Colusa, Sutter, Yolo, Sacramento, Solano and Contra Costa, often forming boundaries between the counties.\nMany of the mountainous regions of the watershed are administered by the U.S. Forest Service. The Sacramento River watershed includes large areas of coniferous forests in the Mendocino and Trinity National Forests in the Coast Ranges, Shasta and Lassen National Forests in the southern Cascades and the Plumas, Tahoe and Eldorado National Forests on the western slopes of the Sierra Nevada. The watershed also has Lassen Volcanic National Park, which covers centered on Lassen Peak, the southernmost Cascade volcano. Whiskeytown-Shasta-Trinity National Recreation Area, which is over in size, straddles much of the upper Sacramento and Trinity Rivers, and is named for the three local reservoirs (Shasta Lake, Trinity Lake and Whiskeytown Lake) which are popular tourist areas. Many other state parks and recreation areas lie within the watershed.\nGeology.\nBy geologic standards, the Sacramento is a fairly young river; the borders of its watershed began to form only a few million years ago as magma welling up below the Earth's crust pushed up by the Pacific Plate colliding with the North American Plate caused the formation of the Sierra Nevada. Although mountains had existed as early as 100\u00a0million years ago in this region (before then the land was probably submerged under the Pacific), they were worn by erosion, and the present-day range only formed about 4\u00a0million years ago. The northern part of the Sacramento watershed is more ancient, and was formed by intense volcanic activity over 25\u00a0million years ago, resulting in lava flows that covered and created the Modoc Plateau, through which the Pit River flows. Mount Shasta and Lassen Peak are among the numerous Cascade Range volcanoes that still stand in the area.\nAs the Sierra rose, water erosion and glaciation carved deep canyons, depositing massive amounts of sediment to form a coastal plain between the mountains and the Pacific Ocean. About 3\u00a0million years ago, multiple terranes were formed and smashed into the North American Plate from the Pacific Plate, causing the uplift of the California Coast Ranges, enclosing the Sacramento Valley and forcing the streams within to flow south instead of west, forming the ancestral Sacramento River. (The Klamath Mountains, which enclose the northwest part of the Sacramento Basin, were formed in the same way but are much older, dating back 7.5\u00a0million years.) It is possible that the river once had its outlet in Monterey Bay, and may have played a part in the formation of the Monterey Submarine Canyon when sea levels were lower during the Ice Ages.\nThe Monterey Bay outlet of the Sacramento and San Joaquin rivers was blocked off by uplift about 2\u00a0million years ago, and runoff from the Sierra began to transform the Central Valley into a gigantic lake, called Lake Clyde. This lake stretched north to south and was at least deep. About 650,000 years ago the lake catastrophically overflowed, draining into San Francisco Bay and creating the Carquinez Strait, the only major break for hundreds of miles in the Coast Ranges. The narrow outlet trapped some of the sediments of the rivers in the Central Valley, forming the inland Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta. Since then, this inland sea has periodically reformed during times of intense flooding, the most recent being the Great Flood of 1862. Dams, levees and floodways constructed during the 20th century have thus far prevented this phenomenon from re-occurring.\nHistory.\nNative Americans.\nThe Sacramento River and its valley were one of the major Native American population centers of California. The river's abundant flow and the valley's fertile soil and mild climate provided enough resources for hundreds of groups to share the land. Most of the villages were small. Although it was once commonly believed that the original natives lived as tribes, they actually lived as bands, family groups as small as twenty to thirty people. The Sacramento Valley was first settled by humans about 12,000 years ago, but permanent villages were not established until about 8,000 years ago. Historians have organized the numerous separate original native groups into several \"tribes\". These are known as the Shasta, Modoc, and Achomawi/Pit River Tribes of the volcanic plateaus in the north; the Wintu and Hupa in the northern Klamath and Trinity mountains; the Nomlaki, Yuki, Patwin, and Pomo of the Coast Ranges; the Yana, Atsugewi, Maidu, Konkow, and Nisenan in the Sierra and their western foothills; and the Miwok in the south.\nMost of the Sacramento Valley's native peoples relied on hunting, gathering and fishing, although agriculture was practiced in a few areas. Settlement size ranged from small camps to villages of 30\u201350 permanent structures. Acorns were a staple food, and the Sacramento Valley's riparian zones, which supported seven species of native oaks, provided these in abundance. Native Americans pounded the acorns into flour, which they used to make bread and cakes. Abundant salmon and steelhead runs in the Sacramento River and its tributaries were harvested using fishing weirs, platforms, baskets and nets. The river also provided shellfish, sturgeon, eel and suckerfish\nThey also hunted waterfowl, antelope and deer which all existed in huge numbers in the rich valley bottom and marsh lands. Before European contact, the indigenous population of the Sacramento Valley has been estimated at 76,000 people.\nEuropean exploration and settlement.\nThe first outsiders to see the river were probably the members of a Spanish colonial-exploratory venture to Northern California in 1772, led by Captain Pedro Fages. The group ascended a mountain, likely in the hills north of Suisun Bay, and found themselves looking down at the delta of the Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers. However, due to their vantage point, neither Fages nor any of his men saw the Sacramento clearly. They assumed that the San Joaquin, coming from the south, was the largest of the merging rivers they saw. In 1808, explorer Gabriel Moraga, on a journey to find suitable sites for the construction of missions, became the first foreigner to see the river clearly. Judging its huge breadth and power he named it \"Rio de los Sacramentos\", or \"River of the Blessed Sacrament\". In the following years, two more Spanish expeditions traversed the lower part of the river, the last one in 1817.\nThe next visitors were Hudson's Bay Company (HBC) fur trappers exploring southwards from the disputed Oregon Country, starting in the 1820s. The first organized expedition, led by Peter Skene Ogden, arrived in the area of Mount Shasta in 1826. By this time, California was under the control of Mexico, although few Mexican settlers had come to what would later become the state, mostly settling in the small \"pueblos\" and \"ranchos\" along the south and central coast. The HBC mountain men created the Siskiyou Trail out of several Native American paths that ran through the mountains between Oregon's Willamette Valley and the northern part of the Sacramento Valley. In the years to come, this path, which eventually extended from San Francisco to Portland, Oregon following parts of the Sacramento, Willamette, Klamath, Rogue, and other rivers would become an important trade and travel route.\nGold Rush.\nAlthough just one of thousands of American emigrants that poured into California over the next few years when California became part of the United States, John Augustus Sutter's arrival marked a turning point in the history of the Sacramento Valley, and California as a whole. In 1841, Sutter and his men built a fortress at the confluence of the Sacramento and American Rivers and the Mexican government granted him almost of land surrounding the two rivers. Naming it New Helvetia, he created an agricultural empire in the lower Sacramento Valley, attracting several hundred settlers to the area, and relied on Native American labor to maintain his domain. Sutter had something of a two-faced relationship with the many Native American groups in the area. He was friendly with some of the tribes, and paid their leaders handsomely for supplying workers, but others he seized by force to labor in the fields.\nAfter the Bear Flag Revolt of 1846 and the Mexican\u2013American War, in which California became part of the United States, Sutter and other large landholders in California held on to their properties. In 1848 Sutter assigned James W. Marshall to build a sawmill on the South Fork American River at Coloma, where Marshall discovered gold. Although Sutter and Marshall originally intended to keep the find a secret, news soon broke attracting three hundred thousand hopefuls from all over North America, and even the world, to the Sacramento River in search of fortunes, kicking off the California Gold Rush. People flocked to the region by the Oregon Trail-Siskiyou Trail, California Trail, Southern Emigrant Trail and various land and/or sea routes through the Isthmus of Panama and around southern South America by ship. Steamboats traveled up and down the Sacramento River carrying miners from San Francisco to the gold fields.\nAs the miners expanded their diggings deeper into the Sierra Nevada and Klamath Mountains, Native Americans were pushed off their land and a long series of skirmishes and fights began that continued until intervention by the state and national governments.\nPost-Gold Rush development and effects.\nThe influx of migrants brought foreign diseases like malaria and smallpox, which American Indians had no immunity to. These diseases killed off a large proportion of their population within a few decades of the arrival of Sutter and the following settlers, the start of the gold rush, not to mention the numerous battles fought between the settlers and native bands as well as the forced relocation of some of the tribes to Indian reservations in several places scattered around the Sacramento Valley, mainly in the Coast Ranges. In the early 1850s, several treaties were signed between the U.S. government and the Native Americans involving their relocation onto a reservation in the Sierra foothills; this promise was broken. Therefore, in 1863, the tribes from the area surrounding the middle Sacramento and Feather rivers, the Konkow group, were removed and marched forcibly to the Round Valley Indian Reservation near the Eel River. A total of 461 people were forced from their homes, but only 277 made it to the reservation; the others perished of disease, starvation or exhaustion.\nAs mining developed from simple methods such as panning and sluicing to a new form of commercialized extraction, hydraulic mining, profits from the petering gold rush made a second leap, earning more profits than placer miners in the early years had ever made. The city of Sacramento, founded on the original site of Sutter's fort, began to flourish as the center of an agricultural empire that provided food to feed the thousands of miners working in the hills as well as a place of financial exchange of all the gold that was mined. Sacramento was officially established in 1850 and was recognized as the state capital in 1854. As the economy of the Sacramento Valley grew, the Southern Pacific Railroad established tracks along the river to connect California with Oregon following the ancient path of the Siskiyou Trail, in the 1880s and 1890s. Many parts of the railroad were treacherous, especially in the mountainous areas north of Dunsmuir.\nIt was not long after Sacramento surpassed a population of 10,000, then the Great Flood of 1862 swept away much of it (and almost everything else along the Sacramento River) and put the rest under water. The flood waters were exacerbated by the sediments washed down by the millions of tons by hydraulic mining, which filled the beds of the Sacramento, Feather and American rivers up to in Sacramento and also covered thousands of acres of Central Valley lands. A flood in 1875 covered the city of Marysville and when it subsided the town's streets were filled with debris and rocks washed down from the \"hydraulicking\" going on upstream.\nRepeated floods and increased demand for Sacramento River water saw a plethora of massive changes to the environment beginning in the 20th century. An early project was undertaken to raise the entire city of Sacramento about above its original elevation. This was followed by much bigger engineering projects to control and store the floodwaters of the Sacramento River; the building of these public works would radically transform the river during the 20th century.\nDams and water use.\nFrom the late 19th century through the 20th century, California experienced an economic boom that led to the rapid expansion of both agriculture and urban areas. The Central Valley was becoming a heavily developed irrigation farming region, and cities along the state's Pacific coast and the Sacramento and San Joaquin rivers were growing rapidly, requiring river control to prevent flooding on the one hand, and to ensure a consistent supply of water on the other. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the State of California completed reports as early as the 1870s and 1880s which outlined future development of the Sacramento, Feather, Yuba and Bear rivers.\nIn 1873, Colonel B.S. Alexander of the Army Corps of Engineers surveyed the Central Valley's hydrology and irrigation systems and proposed a great network of pumps and canals that would take water from the Sacramento River in the north, and transport it to drought-prone central and southern California, especially the San Joaquin Valley. The Sacramento River basin receives \"two-thirds to three-quarters of northern California's precipitation though it has only one-third to one-quarter of the land. The San Joaquin River watershed occupies two-thirds to three-quarters of northern California's land, but only collects one-third to one-quarter of the precipitation.\" The topography of the Sacramento River watershed makes it particularly prone to flooding. Storm water runs quickly off the steep mountains flanking the Sacramento Valley, but with few exceptions the alluvial valley floor is strikingly flat, slowing down the runoff and causing it to overflow the river banks. Before flood control works were built, the winter floods frequently transformed the valley into an inland sea. In 1880 State Engineer William H. Hall developed the first flood control plan for the Sacramento River. Hall recognized that with the combination of flat topography and extremely heavy winter runoff volumes, a system of levees alone could not hope to contain flooding, as had been proven time and again in the flood prone city of Sacramento.\nSacramento River Flood Control Project.\nThe Sacramento River Flood Control Project was authorized by the federal government in 1917. While it intended to contain minor floods in the river banks by strengthening the existing levee system, the main feature was a series of bypasses, or sections of the valley intentionally designed to flood during high water. Weirs placed at strategic points along the Sacramento River release water into the bypasses when the river reaches a certain stage, relieving the pressure of floodwaters on the main channel. The bypasses are then allowed to drain slowly once flood crests have passed. For most of the year, the bypasses remain dry and are used for annual crops such as rice. Some of the principal features are the Butte Basin, Colusa Basin, Sutter Bypass and the Yolo Bypass. The Butte Basin is a large lowland area on the east side of the river between Hamilton City and Colusa; the geographically similar Colusa Basin is located to the west. The Sutter Bypass begins at Colusa and runs parallel to the east side of the Sacramento River until reaching the confluence with the Feather River. The Yolo Bypass, located on the west side of the river, starts at the confluence of the Feather and rejoins the Sacramento in the Delta. Although termed \"bypasses\", the system essentially reconnects the Sacramento with a portion of its historic flood plain, which it would have naturally flooded had the levee system not been in place.\nCentral Valley Project.\nDuring the Great Depression in the 1930s, the first concrete proposals for a statewide water engineering project emerged, but when the state government could not sell the necessary bonds to fund the project, the federal government took over. The Central Valley Project, one of the largest irrigation projects in the world, was constructed by the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation beginning in 1935. Ultimately, the system would distribute to irrigate of land in the Sacramento and San Joaquin Valleys. Construction of Shasta Dam, the principal water storage facility in the Sacramento River system, started in 1938 and was completed in 1945. Controlling runoff from the upper of the Sacramento River watershed, Shasta greatly reduces flood peaks on the middle and lower parts of the Sacramento River. Flood waters are stored for irrigation in dry years as well as navigation and electricity generation. In the following decades, more huge reservoirs \u2013 capable of storing a combined of water \u2013 were constructed on the Sacramento's main tributaries, enabling the regulation of water for irrigation and hydroelectric power. Starting in the late 1950s, two major canals were extended to irrigate the western side of the Sacramento Valley \u2013 the Tehama-Colusa and Corning Canals. Starting at the Red Bluff Diversion Dam on the Sacramento, the canals are long respectively, and divert a total of over of water to irrigate some .\nState Water Project.\nIn 1960, construction began on the State Water Project, whose primary purpose was to deliver water to Los Angeles and the San Francisco Bay Area. Oroville Dam \u2013 the tallest dam in the U.S. \u2013 was built on the Sacramento's largest tributary, the Feather River. A series of channels were enlarged in the Delta to facilitate water flow from the Sacramento to the Banks Pumping Plant and the California Aqueduct, which can carry as much as of water each year. From its origin at the Delta the canal runs southwards through the west side of the San Joaquin Valley, providing irrigation water to farmlands along its length, and lifted almost over the Tehachapi Mountains via four large pumping stations. The project irrigates of land in the San Joaquin Valley and serves 22\u00a0million people in Central and Southern California.\nOver the years, several other plans materialized to divert rivers from California's North Coast into the Sacramento watershed, as future demand was projected to exceed supply. The only one to be built was the Trinity River Project (which would become part of the CVP), sending over 90\u00a0percent of the flow of that river into the Sacramento via a tunnel under the Klamath Mountains. Due to environmental damage and fish kills in the Trinity River, the volume of diverted water has been limited by law since the 1990s. Other, larger projects ultimately failed to take root. One of the most notorious, the Klamath Diversion, proposed to send the entire flow of the Klamath River into the Sacramento River through a system of large reservoirs, canals, pumping stations and tunnels. Similarly, the Dos Rios Dam project would have diverted a considerable portion of the Eel River to the Sacramento. Both projects were defeated by local resistance, opposition from environmentalists, as well as the high capital cost.\nNavigation.\nThe Sacramento River Deep Water Ship Channel was completed in 1963, and was built to facilitate navigation of large oceangoing ships from the Delta to the port of Sacramento. The channel bypasses the winding lower part of the Sacramento River between the state capital and the Delta thus reducing water travel times. It also serves to discharge floodwaters from the lower end of the Yolo Bypass. Built by the Army Corps of Engineers, the canal is long and is maintained to a depth of .\nEcology and environmental issues.\nThe Sacramento River and its drainage basin once supported extensive riparian habitat and marshes, in both the Sacramento Valley and the Delta, home to a diverse array of flora and fauna. Due to the reclamation of land for agriculture and the regulation of seasonal flooding, the amount of water-based habitat declined greatly during the 20th century. Other human impacts include the heavy water consumption for agriculture and urban areas, and pollution caused by pesticides, nitrates, mine tailings, acid mine drainage and urban runoff. The Sacramento supports 40\u201360 species of fish, and 218 species of birds. The basin also has a number of endemic amphibian and fish species. Many Sacramento River fish species are similar to those in the Snake\u2013Columbia River systems; geologic evidence indicates that the two were connected by a series of wetlands and channels about 4\u20135\u00a0million years ago.\nLocated along the Pacific Flyway, the sprawling wetlands of the Sacramento Valley are an important stop for migratory birds; however, only a fraction of the historic wetlands remain. Seasonally flooded rice paddies in the Sacramento Valley comprise a large portion of the habitat currently used by migrating birds. Native bird populations have been declining steadily since the 19th century. Species that were once common but now are endangered or gone include the southwestern willow flycatcher, western yellow-billed cuckoo, least Bell's vireo, and warbling vireo. Another reason for dropping numbers are the introduction of non-native species, such as the parasitic cowbird, which lays its eggs in the nests of other bird species causing its hatchlings to compete with the others for food.\nThere were once 9 species of amphibians that used the Sacramento River, but some have become extinct and most other populations are declining due to habitat loss caused by agriculture and urban development. Amphibians originally thrived in the marshes, sloughs, side-channels and oxbow lakes because of their warmer water, abundance of vegetation and nutrients, lower predator populations and slower current. This population once included several species of frogs and salamanders; the foothill yellow-legged frog and western spadefoot are listed as endangered species.\nRiparian and wetlands areas along the Sacramento once totaled more than ; today only about remains. Much of this consists of restored stretches and artificially constructed wetlands. Levee construction has prevented the river from changing course during winter and spring floods, which was crucial to the renewal of existing wetlands and the creation of new ones. Since the late 19th century the river has been mostly locked in a fixed channel, which once could shift hundreds of feet or even several miles in a year because of floods. In 2010, about of the river's riparian forests were undergoing restoration.\nUC Davis initiated a project known as The Nigiri Project which takes place under the Yolo Bypass in the rice field floodplains adjacent to the Sacramento River. The name comes from a form of Japanese sushi which contains a slice of fish on top of a compressed wedge of vinegared rice. Salmon migrate from the Central Valley rivers to the ocean where they increase in size for one to three years then return to rivers to spawn, if a young fish is larger when they enter the ocean, they will have more of a chance to return for spawning. According to UC Davis Center for Watershed Sciences these rice fields adjacent to the Sacramento River will serve as potential nurseries for salmon. UC Davis also concluded from past experimental releases of salmon, that the Yolo Bypass floodway could have up to 57,000 acres of a productive breeding habitat with almost no cost to farmers. The Nigiri project has demonstrated off-season agriculture fields such as the rice fields under the Yolo Bypass next to Sacramento River can serve as an important floodplain habitat and feeding ground for juvenile or endangered fish. UC Davis noted juveniles grew much bigger and faster within the flooded rice fields when compared to those released in the Sacramento River. Public agencies, conservation groups and landowners have all been working together and conducting experiments since 2011. Experiments conducted on rice fields took place at the Knaggs Ranch property within the Yolo Bypass by Sacramento River for four consecutive winters. UC Davis shares their results produced the fastest growth of juvenile Chinook salmon in the Central Valley to ever be recorded. The Nigiri project attempted to see if these floodplains as surrogate wetlands which can be controlled to copy the Sacramento River system's annual natural flooding cycle the native fish depend on. Runoff water from agriculture is used to flood the fields for most of this experiment adjacent to the Sacramento River. The water is eventually flushed back into the Delta ecosystem through agricultural canals.\nAnadromous fish.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThe Sacramento River fall chinook stock is the driver of commercial and recreational salmon fisheries off California and most of Oregon.\n\u2014 Pacific Fishery Management Council, 2008\nSecond only to the Columbia River on the west coast of the United States in Chinook salmon runs, the Sacramento and its tributaries once supported a huge population of this fish. Millions of salmon once swam upstream to spawn in the Sacramento; as recently as 2002 eight hundred thousand fish were observed to return to the river. The Sacramento and San Joaquin River systems are home to the southernmost existing run of chinook salmon in North America.\nStarting in the 20th century, dam construction blocked off hundreds of miles of salmon-spawning streams, such as the upper Feather and American Rivers, and the entirety of the Pit and upper Sacramento rivers. Pollution from farms and urban areas took a heavy toll on the river's environment, and heavy irrigation withdrawals sometimes resulted in massive fish kills. Since 1960, when the big pumps at the head of the California Aqueduct in the Delta began their operation, the pattern of water flow in the Delta has been changed considerably leaving the fish confused as to where to go, resulting in many generations dying off because they have not been able to find their way upstream. In 2004, only 200,000 fish were reported to return to the Sacramento; in 2008, a disastrous low of 39,000.\nIn 1999, five hydroelectric dams on Battle Creek, a major tributary of the Sacramento River, were removed to allow better passage of the fish. Three other dams along the creek were fitted with fish ladders. The river is considered one of the best salmon habitats in the watershed because of its relatively cold water and the availability of ideal habitat such as gravel bars.\nBy the late 20th and early 21st centuries, the government blamed crashing fish populations on overfishing, especially off the Northern California and Oregon coast, which lie directly adjacent to the migration paths of Sacramento River salmon. This has resulted in a ban on coastal salmon fishing for several years since 2002. The Red Bluff Diversion Dam, although not a large dam and equipped with fish passage facilities, also presents a major barrier. Because of inadequate design, roughly 25\u201340% of the incoming fish get blocked by the dam each year. The dam has also become a \"favorite spot\" for predatory fish to congregate, feasting on the salmon that get trapped both above and below the dam. As of 2010, the salmon run has shown slight signs of improvement, probably because of that year's greater precipitation.\nIn 1995, a gate on the Folsom Dam on the American River broke open, causing the river's flow to rise by some . The water traveled down the Sacramento and washed into the Pacific; the influx of fresh water was such that it confused thousands of anadromous fish to begin migrating up the river, thinking that the river had risen because of late-autumn storms.\nWhales.\nWhales are occasionally found far inland after navigating the river for food or refuge and then losing track of how to get back to the Pacific Ocean. In October 1985 a humpback whale affectionately named \"Humphrey the humpbacked whale\" by television media traveled up the Sacramento River before being rescued. Rescuers downstream broadcast sounds of humpback whales feeding to draw the whale back to the ocean.\nOn May 14, 2007, onlookers and media spotted two humpback whales traveling the deep waters near Rio Vista. The duo, generally believed to be mother and calf (Delta, the mother and Dawn, her calf), continued to swim upstream to the deep water ship channel near West Sacramento, about inland. There was concern because the whales had been injured, perhaps by a boat's propeller or keel, leaving a gash in each whale's skin. The whales were carefully inspected by biologists and injected with antibiotics to help prevent infection. After days of efforts to lure (or frighten) the whales in the direction of the ocean, the whales eventually made their way south into San Francisco Bay, where they lingered for several days. By May 30, 2007, the cow and calf apparently slipped out unnoticed under the Golden Gate Bridge into the Pacific Ocean, likely under cover of night.\nSea lions.\nRecently, sea lions have been found traveling far up the Sacramento in search of nutrient rich salmon. These individuals tend to be young males looking to bulk up before breeding season. The recent boom of sea lion sightings in the river has been attributed to the passage of the Marine Mammal Protection Act in 1972, leading to a resurgence in sea lion populations, requiring the species to expand its range.\nCommon locations to spot sea lions are underneath the Tower Bridge, the mouth of the Feather River, and the confluence of the Sacramento and American River at Discovery Park.\nPollution.\nFor a river of its size, the Sacramento is considered to have fairly clean water. However, pollutants still flow into the river from many of its tributaries and man-made drains or channels. Pesticide runoff, especially DDT, is one of the largest problems faced today, because of the valley's primarily agricultural economy. Increased erosion caused by the removal of riparian vegetation and the runoff of fertilizers into the river have led to occasional algae blooms, though the water is usually cold because of the regulation of dams upstream. Other pollutant sources include urban runoff, mercury and even rocket fuel that was reported to have leaked near the American River from an Aerojet extraction project.\nMercury pollution created by mining and processing activities during the California Gold Rush still has a profound impact on the Sacramento River's environment. According to Domagalski of the USGS, Mercury is currently considered the most serious water-quality problem in the Sacramento River. Mercury is unique because it is the heaviest liquid in existence, it is the only heavy metal that is a liquid at room temperature and it readily vaporizes into the atmosphere. The toxic substance was widely used by miners to separate gold from the surrounding rocks and dirt, and was disposed of by allowing it to evaporate. Most of the mercury was mined in the Coast Ranges to the west of the Sacramento River; mines in these mountains produced roughly 140,000 tons of mercury to serve the Gold Rush. When the gold rush ended, most of the mines were closed but toxic acidic water and chemicals continue to leak from within, into west-side Sacramento tributaries such as Cache Creek and Putah Creek. According to the Sacramento Watershed River Program, an abandoned mercury mine, which is currently an EPA superfund site, is located in the Cache Creek area in the Sacramento River, called the Sulfur Bank Mercury Mine, which is still releasing mercury with leachate into Clear Lake which is close by. This site along with other former mine sites add to the contamination of Cache Creek which is estimated to be responsible for 50% of mercury taken to the Bay Delta area every year. In the east, mercury that permeated into the ground has contaminated several aquifers that feed rivers such as the Feather, Yuba and American. Even the evaporated mercury posed problems \u2013 so much of it was used that significant concentrations still linger in the air in many places. According to Griffin with the Sacramento Water Action Team, Mercury cannot naturally escape or dissipate and will be brought down into the soils and sediment to pollute and react with, in some of these cases methane can be produced from the mercury which will contribute to the greenhouse gases and is another contributing issue with mercury pollution, ecological alteration of the Sacramento River and climate change. Griffin shares, \"Mercury and its compounds readily attach to particulate material in soil and sediment. In the presence of living organisms ionic mercury can transform into monomethylmercury and dimethylmercury. When exposed to sunlight the (di)methylmercury is photodegraded to monomethyl mercury, usually near the surface of water, and methane gas is released\". According to the USGS 2016, the mercury release leaves a permanent imprint not only in the Sacramento River Watershed but also in peat bogs, snowcapped glaciers and sediments up to hundreds and thousands of miles away. Mercury pollution continues today and will probably continue for decades or centuries into the future.\nAnother form of pollution the Sacramento River is suffering from is plastic pollution. According to researchers from University of California Berkeley, they recorded over 7 trillion microplastics being deposited in the San Francisco Bay each year with the Sacramento River being a major contributor. They also found microplastics in one fourth of anchovy, striped bass and salmon stomachs in the Bay Area.\nIn July 1991, a train derailed near Dunsmuir, California alongside the Sacramento River. A tank car split open, spilling about 19,500 gallons of the pesticide metam sodium into the river. The chemical formed a stinking, bubbling, green glob that moved down the river, killing everything in its path. More than one million fish were killed, including at least 100,000 rainbow trout, and thousands of other aquatic creatures as well as nearby trees. Next, the green glob entered Shasta Lake, California's largest reservoir. Fortunately, a system of aerating pipes at the bottom of the lake had been set up to dissipate the chemical, reducing it to almost nothing by the 29th, preventing further environmental destruction. The tank car carrying the metam sodium through California was of a type that the National Transportation Safety Board said had \"a high incidence of failure\" in accidents. Furthermore, the tank car was not labeled, so the train's crew was unaware of the danger posed by the chemical.\nDiazinon was a major pollution problem in the Sacramento River which would originate from agricultural and urban storm water discharges. Diazinon is used for orchards which grow peaches, plums, and almonds to mitigate the number of insects and pests like spider mites and aphids. A wide variety of organizations and groups came together to reduce diazinon concentrations in the Sacramento and Feather River systems. Their collaboration and hard work led to the removal of 79 river miles from the 303(d) list for diazinon impairments in 2010 according to the Environmental Protection Agency.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

A suburb of Orlando, Celebration is located near Walt Disney World Resort and was originally developed by the Walt Disney Company. Its population was recorded as 11,178 in the 2020 United States census.\nAfter founding Celebration, Disney followed its plans to divest most of its control of the town. Several Disney business units continue to occupy the town's office buildings. The town itself is connected to the Walt Disney World resorts via one of its primary streets, World Drive, which begins near the Magic Kingdom.\nVarious New Classical architects participated in the design of buildings in Celebration. Downtown Celebration's post office was designed by Michael Graves, the adjacent Welcome Center by Philip Johnson, and the Celebration Health building by Robert A. M. Stern. \nOther well-known architects who have designed nearby buildings include Charles Moore (Preview Center), Graham Gund (Bohemian Hotel), Cesar Pelli (movie theater), and Robert Venturi and Denise Scott Brown (SunTrust Bank).\nHistory.\nEarly development.\nIn the early 1990s, the Disney Development Company (DDC) established the Celebration Company to spearhead its development within about of land in the southern portion of the Reedy Creek Improvement District. Total investment for the project is estimated at US$2.5\u00a0billion.\nThe master plan was developed by two Driehaus Prize winning architects, Jacquelin T. Robertson of Cooper, Robertson &amp; Partners and Robert A. M. Stern. The extensive landscape, parks, trails and pathways were designed by the San Francisco firm EDAW (now AECOM). Urban Design Associates, of Pittsburgh, developed design guidelines, called a Pattern Book, as a tool for the design of new architecture within the community. Celebration is planned in an early 20th-century architectural style and is not zoned for high-density residences. Celebration was named the \"New Community of the Year\" in 2001 by the Urban Land Institute. Disney hired graphic designer Michael Beirut to design community elements including street signs, retail signage, manhole covers, fountains, golf course graphics, park trail markers, as well as home sales brochures.\nThe first phase of residential development occurred in the summer of 1996 with Celebration Village, West Village, and Lake Evalyn; this was followed by the North Village, South Village, East Village and Aquila Reserve and the final Artisan Park phases. Later phases included construction by a number of developers, including David Waronker.\nDisney CEO Michael Eisner took an especially keen interest in the development of the new town in the early days, encouraging the executives at Disney Development Company to \"make history\" and develop a town worthy of the Disney brand and legacy that extended to Walt Disney's vision of an Experimental Prototype Community of Tomorrow (EPCOT). DDC executives collaborated extensively with leaders in education, health, and technology in addition to planners and architects to create the vision and operating policies for the town.\nThere were a series of car accidents involving a retention pond adjacent to World Drive which required the addition of more safety structures.\nDisney attempted numerous efforts to encourage economic and ethnic diversity among residents in the early days of development. The company placed advertisements in newspapers and magazines that catered to African-American and Hispanic demographics, printed brochures featuring racial minorities, and hired African-American workers in the community's sales office. In addition, the owners of the first 350 houses and 123 apartments were chosen by a lottery in an effort to prevent racial discrimination against homebuyers. However, by 2000, it was revealed that the racial makeup of the community was 88% white, compared to the surrounding county's 59% white population. Demographers partially blamed the lack of diversity on Disney's decision to forego building subsidized housing inside the community, instead opting to donate $900,000 to Osceola County to help area residents buy houses under $80,000, below the market value of most housing in Celebration.\nCivil suit.\nIn 2016, \"The Wall Street Journal\" reported that Celebration Town Center condominium owners \"are battling leaky roofs, balconies that have become separated from the sides of buildings and mold spreading in their walls. Their properties have become so dilapidated, they say, they're having trouble selling them.\"\nAn April 2016 civil suit seeks to force the Town Center Foundation, a controlling entity under sole direction of Lexin Capital, \"which took control of part of Celebration in 2004, to pay for upward of $15 million to $20 million in repairs\" which were deferred over ten years.\nGeography.\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of , of which , or 0.28%, is water.\nCelebration is under USPS ZIP code 34747, sometimes known as Kissimmee. This is due to the city being unincorporated, as Celebration is not a subdivision and is still considered an unincorporated town.\nNature trails.\nCelebration is well known by Orlando Area residents for its town center, luxury houses, and walkability, which includes the Celebration Nature Trails. Celebration has over of nature trails connecting the entire neighborhood. The nature trails provide access to scenery and wildlife, and are accessible on foot or by bike.\nDemographics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"US Census population/styles.css\"/&gt;\nAs of the census of 2010, there were 7,427 people, 3,063 households, and 716 families residing in the CDP. The population density was . There were 4,566 housing units at an average density of . The racial makeup of the CDP was 91.0% white (with 81.9% of the population non-Hispanic white), 1.5% black, 3.2% Asian, 2.2% from two or more races and 0.26% Native American. Hispanics or Latinos of any race were 11.2% of the population.\nThere were 3,063 households, out of which 32.7% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 57.0% were married couples living together, 4.5% had a female householder with no married spouse present, and 35.0% were non-families. 24.3% of all households were made up of individuals, and 3.6% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.44 and the average family size was 2.96.\nThe age distribution was 25.6% under the age of 18, and 9.2% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 37 years. For every 100 females, there were 94.7 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 93.5 males in that age range.\nThe median income for a household in the CDP was $74,231, and the median income for a family was $92,334. Males had a median income of $51,250 versus $46,650 for females. The per-capita income for the CDP was $39,521, and 4.1% of the population lived below the poverty line.\nGovernment.\nThe area is organized under state law as a community development district. The largest landowners are entities controlled by the Walt Disney Company.\nPolitics.\nFor decades Celebration was very politically conservative.\nCelebration is entirely within Florida's 9th congressional district and is represented by Democrat Darren Soto in the U.S. House of Representatives. In the legislature, Celebration is represented by Democrat Kristen Arrington in the State Senate and Republican Carolina Amesty in the State House of Representatives.\nCity life.\nDowntown.\nCelebration Town Center contains shops, restaurants, and other commercial establishments, as well as 106 residences.\nWorship.\nCelebration has six Christian churches, one Jewish congregation, and one hospital ministry.\nCommerce.\nThere are now more than 500 registered companies listed as doing business in the shopping plazas, small office complexes, and the Disney World office building park. This community holds the only Class A office buildings in Osceola County.\nVillages.\nCelebration is separated into areas referred to as \"villages.\" The main village, closest to downtown, is where the first homes were constructed. North Village, closest to US-192, houses the Georgetown Condos as well as Acadia Estate Homes. East Village includes Roseville Corner and Aquila Loop. Lake Evalyn, generally considered its own area of Celebration but not quite its own village, includes a small lake where one can find a multitude of ducks, alligators, and the occasional river otter. South Village houses the Spring Park Loop estate homes and Heritage Hall. Additionally, Siena Condos complete the outer edge of South Village by Celebration Blvd. Mirasol includes condos with concierge service and a day spa. Artisan Park is at the end of Celebration Ave and houses condos, townhomes, single-family residences as well as a clubhouse consisting of a pool, gym, and restaurant.\nEvents.\nCelebration hosts many celebrations every year, including community-wide yard sales, an art show, an exotic car festival, an annual Radio Disney Holiday concert, an Oktoberfest Celebration, the \"Great American Pie Festival\" (televised on the Food Network), a \"Posh Pooch\" festival, and downtown events for the Fall and Christmas seasons when autumn leaves and \"snow\" (small-scale soap flakes) are released into the Town Center. The community also hosts a large Independence Day fireworks celebration. The town events are organized on the Internet by the Community Calendar.\nEducation.\nPublic.\nThe School District of Osceola County, Florida, operates public schools in Celebration. Celebration is zoned to the Celebration School for K-8. Celebration High School, located in the city, serves Celebration for grades 9\u201312.\nThere are free classes offered at the community center by clubs for cooking, gardening, art, writing, and technology.\nPrivate.\nThere are private education options provided by the Montessori Academy of Celebration (K-8).\nPrivate graduate education was once offered at Stetson University Celebration Campus. The Stetson Celebration campus was sold in 2018 with plans to convert it into offices. It was purchased again in 2021 with intent to open a medical school in the building.\nLibrary.\nThe Osceola Library System operates the West Osceola Branch Library in Celebration.\nInfrastructure.\nTransportation.\nIn 2011, 91% of residents who work outside their homes drove to work.\nThe two main roads going through the center of the Celebration's downtown area are Market Street and Front Street. Other streets in Celebration include:\nHealthcare.\nThe only hospital in Celebration is the non-profit hospital AdventHealth Celebration. The hospital is affiliated with AdventHealth Orlando. With its Mediterranean-style and proximity to Walt Disney World, the hospital attracts patients from around the world. In April 2024, AdventHealth announced it will add a 44,966-square-foot five story patient tower to the campus, with three operating rooms and 80 beds (increasing the number of hospital beds to 427). The hospital would be one of the largest hospitals in Osceola County.\nReferences.\nNotes\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography"}
{"id": "37397", "revid": "48101294", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37397", "title": "Epcot", "text": "Theme park at Walt Disney World\nEpcot (stylized in capital letters as EPCOT) is a theme park at the Walt Disney World Resort in Bay Lake, Florida. It is owned and operated by the Walt Disney Company through its Disney Experiences division. The park opened on October 1, 1982, as EPCOT Center\u2014the second of four theme parks built at the resort. Often referred to as a \"permanent world's fair\", Epcot is dedicated to the celebration of human achievement, particularly technological innovation and international culture and is known for its iconic landmark Spaceship Earth, a geodesic sphere.\nDuring early development of the Florida property, Walt Disney wanted to build an experimental planned community showcasing modern innovation, known as \"EPCOT\". After Disney's death in 1966, the company felt his grand vision was impractical. However, it laid the groundwork for EPCOT Center, a theme park that retained the core spirit of Disney's vision. The park was divided into two distinct areas: Future World reprises the idea of showcasing modern innovation through educational entertainment attractions within avant-garde pavilions, while World Showcase highlights the diversity of human cultures from various nations. From the late 2010s to the early 2020s, the park underwent a major overhaul, adding new attractions and Future World was restructured into three areas: World Celebration, World Discovery and World Nature.\nThe park spans , more than twice the size of Magic Kingdom Park. In 2024, the park attracted 12.1 million guests, making it the eighth-most visited theme park in the world.\nHistory.\n1960s: Experimental concept.\nThe genesis for Epcot was originally conceived as a utopian city of the future by Walt Disney in the 1960s. The concept was an acronym for Experimental Prototype Community of Tomorrow, often interchanging \"city\" and \"community.\" In Walt Disney's words in 1966: \"EPCOT will take its cue from the new ideas and new technologies that are now emerging from the creative centers of American industry. It will be a community of tomorrow that will never be completed but will always be introducing and testing, and demonstrating new materials and new systems. And EPCOT will always be a showcase to the world of the ingenuity and imagination of American free enterprise.\"\nWalt Disney's original vision, sometimes called Progress City, would have been home to 20,000 residents and would be a living laboratory showcasing cutting-edge technology and urban planning. It was to be built in the shape of a circle with an urban city center in the center with community buildings, schools, and recreational complexes. It would be surrounded by rings of residential areas and industrial areas, all connected by monorail and PeopleMover lines. Automobile traffic would be kept underground, leaving pedestrians safe above ground. This radial plan concept is strongly influenced by British planner Ebenezer Howard and his Garden Cities of To-morrow.\nDisney went as far as petitioning the Florida State Legislature for the creation of the Reedy Creek Improvement District (RCID), with the authority of a governmental body over the Walt Disney World land. The RCID was established in 1967. However, Walt Disney was not able to obtain funding and permission to start work on his Florida property until he agreed to first build the Magic Kingdom theme park. He died in 1966, nearly five years before Magic Kingdom opened.\n1970s: Concept evolves into park.\nAfter Walt Disney's death, the company decided that it did not want to be in the business of running a city without Walt's guidance. The original plans for the park showed indecision over the park's purpose. Some Imagineers wanted it to represent the cutting edge of emerging technologies, while others wanted it to showcase international cultures and customs. At one point, a model of the futuristic park was pushed together against a model of a World's Fair international theme, and the two were combined.\nThe park was originally named EPCOT Center to reflect the ideals and values of the city. It was constructed for an estimated $800\u00a0million to $1.4\u00a0billion and took three years to build, at the time the largest construction project on Earth. The park spans , more than twice the size of Magic Kingdom. The parking lot serving the park is (including bus area) and can accommodate 11,211 vehicles.\n1980s: Opening and operation.\nThe grand opening festivities for EPCOT Center took place over three weeks in October 1982\u2014supervised and directed by Disney Legend Bob Jani. The park officially opened to the public on October 1, with a dedication ceremony in front of Spaceship Earth that served as both the kick-off ceremony as well as the dedication of the Spaceship Earth attraction itself. Presiding over the ceremony was Walt Disney Productions chairman and CEO Card Walker, Florida Governor Bob Graham, and president of AT&amp;T (the sponsor of Spaceship Earth at opening) William Ellinghaus.\nOn opening day, Future World featured six pavilions: Spaceship Earth, CommuniCore, Journey Into Imagination, The Land, Universe of Energy, and World of Motion. World Showcase featured nine pavilions: Mexico, China, Germany, Italy, The American Adventure, Japan, France, United Kingdom, and Canada.\nEach pavilion had its own custom opening ceremony throughout the next three weeks\u2014culminating in the three-day grand opening event. On October 24, 1982, EPCOT Center was officially dedicated by Walt Disney Productions executive chairman Donn Tatum and Card Walker. A 450-piece marching band made up of players from college bands all over the country performed several songs including \"We've Just Begun to Dream\" and \"The World Showcase March\"\u2014the latter written exclusively for the opening events by the Sherman Brothers. Water was gathered from major rivers, lakes, and seas from across the globe and emptied into the park's Fountain of Nations to mark the opening.\nDuring the 1980s, several additional pavilions opened: Horizons in 1983, Morocco in 1984, The Living Seas in 1986, Norway in 1988, and Wonders of Life in 1989.\n1990s\u20132000s: Change in vision.\nDespite its initial success, Epcot was constantly faced with the challenges of evolving with worldwide progress, an issue that caused the park to lose relevance and become outdated in the 1990s. To maintain attendance levels, Disney introduced seasonal events such as the International Flower &amp; Garden Festival and the International Food &amp; Wine Festival in 1994 and 1995, respectively.\nIt was during this era that Disney sought to differentiate the Epcot theme park from Walt Disney's EPCOT concept by making the park's name a word rather than an acronym\u2014spelling it in lowercase as a proper noun: \"Epcot\". Walt Disney World then added the current year to the park's name, emulating the naming scheme for expos and world's fairs like Expo 67. The park became Epcot '94 and Epcot '95 before Disney quietly abandoned the naming concept in 1996 and the park simply became Epcot.\nIn 1994, \"Captain EO\" performed its last show of its original run, being directly replaced by \"Honey, I Shrunk the Audience\" that year. In the mid-1990s, Disney also began to gradually phase out the park's edutainment attractions in favor of more modern and thrilling attractions. As a result, many of the attractions within the Future World pavilions were either overhauled or replaced entirely. The Land pavilion saw its attractions replaced under new sponsor Nestl\u00e9 between late 1993 and January 1995, and Spaceship Earth was updated with music by Edo Guidotti and narration from Jeremy Irons in 1994. Universe of Energy was reconfigured as Ellen's Energy Adventure in 1996. Journey Into Imagination closed in 1998 and was replaced with Journey into YOUR Imagination the following year, World of Motion was replaced with Test Track, and Horizons was demolished in 1999 and replaced with in 2003.\nIn 2000, Walt Disney World held the Millennium Celebration with the central focus of the event at Epcot, and a 25-story \"magic wand\" structure was built next to Spaceship Earth. Millennium Village was closed on January 1, 2001, and was turned into the World Showplace festival center, which is frequently used for Epcot festivals.\nAttraction changes continued into the new millennium. Journey into YOUR Imagination closed in 2001 due to strong negative reception and was replaced with Journey into Imagination with Figment in 2002. The Living Seas was closed in 2005, and rethemed with the introduction of characters from \"Finding Nemo\", as The Seas with Nemo &amp; Friends. That same year, Soarin', a flight simulator ride originally developed for Disney California Adventure Park, was added to The Land (replacing Food Rocks) following its massive popularity in California. The Wonders of Life pavilion closed in 2007, with the pavilion being occasionally used for the park's annual festivals until permanent closure. The Mexico pavilion's El Rio del Tiempo attraction closed on January 2, and Gran Fiesta Tour Starring The Three Caballeros opened in its space a few months later. After the \"magic wand\" structure was removed from Spaceship Earth, the attraction's fourth version, narrated by Judi Dench, soft-opened on December 8. \"Kim Possible\" World Showcase Adventure, an interactive scavenger hunt, opened at Epcot in 2009.\n2010s\u2013present: Transformation and redesign.\nIn 2012, Test Track was refurbished into a new version presented by Chevrolet, and Kim Possible World Showcase Adventure was rethemed to Agent P's World Showcase Adventure the same year. The Norway pavilion's Maelstrom attraction closed in 2014 and replaced two years later by Frozen Ever After. Soarin' was also temporarily closed while a new film was added to the attraction. In 2017, Mission: SPACE was divided into a new green/Earth mission, and the original orange/Mars mission.\nIn November 2016, Disney revealed that Epcot would be receiving \u201ca major transformation\u201d that would help transition the park into being \u201cmore Disney, timeless, relevant, family-friendly\u201d. In July 2017, the formal announcement came that Epcot would undergo a multi-year redesign and expansion plan that would introduce \"Guardians of the Galaxy\" and \"Ratatouille\" attractions to Future World and World Showcase, respectively, as well as maintaining the original vision and spirit for the park. As part of the announcement, Ellen's Energy Adventure closed the following month, and the pavilion's show building was reused for , while the Epcot 35 Legacy Showcase exhibition opened in the Odyssey Pavilion. That same year, the park reported the first drop in overall attendance ranking among the four Walt Disney World Resort parks, dropping from second to third place, the first in its history.\nOn August 25, 2019, at the 2019 D23 Expo, Disney expanded on the plans for the improvements to Epcot. One of the most significant changes announced was the creation of four distinct \"neighborhoods\"; the subdivision of Future World into three areas (World Celebration, World Discovery, and World Nature). Journey of Water\u2014Inspired by \"Moana\"\",\" a walkthrough attraction, was also announced. At the same expo, Disney also announced that Pinar Toprak would be composing a new musical anthem for the park. Toprak's \"Epcot Anthem\" was eventually used in various nighttime shows, such as \"Harmonious\" and \",\" as well as featured in ambient music within the entrance plaza and throughout World Celebration.\nOn October 1, 2019, it was announced that a new nighttime fireworks show, \"Epcot Forever\", and The Epcot Experience Center, a preview space for the park's expansion project, would replace \"\" and Epcot 35 Legacy Showcase. In late 2019, Epcot installed new directory signage in Seabase Alpha, restoring the former Living Seas logo, as the pavilion was renamed to The Seas Pavilion. Agent P's World Showcase Adventure closed on February 23, 2020; it was slated to be replaced with \"DuckTales\" World Showcase Adventure, which did not open until 2022.\nIn early 2020, Disney officially announced that the park would be rebranded in all-uppercase letters (from Epcot to EPCOT) as an homage to both the park's original name and Walt Disney's original concept\u2014although the name is still not an acronym.\nEpcot was closed from March 16 to July 15, 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Florida. Modified operations were established, including a pause on concerts and fireworks, in order to promote sufficient physical distancing. \"Spaceship Earth: Our Shared Story\", the attraction's fifth update, the \"Wondrous China\" film, the PLAY! pavilion in World Discovery, and the United Kingdom pavilion's Cherry Tree Lane expansion were indefinitely delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and the CommuniCore Hall exhibit space and the CommuniCore Plaza festival stage was built instead of a three-level festival pavilion.\nOn September 29, 2021, the nighttime spectacular \"Harmonious\" replaced \"Epcot Forever\" as part of the resort's 50th anniversary celebration. The show ended its run on March 31, 2023, in preparation for \"\" which debuted later that year; \"Epcot Forever\" returned during the interim period. Remy's Ratatouille Adventure (duplicated from Disneyland Paris) opened in the France pavilion on October 1 as part of the same celebrations. The Epcot Experience Center closed in 2022, and opened on May 27.\nJourney of Water: Inspired by Moana opened in World Nature opened on October 16, 2023, and World Celebration Gardens, divided into five sections (Inspiration Gardens, CommuniCore Gardens, Connections Gardens, Creations Gardens, and Dreamers Point) opened on December 5 of that year.

CommuniCore Hall and Plaza, named after the former Future World pavilion, opened to the general public on June 10, 2024. Test Track, closed for refurbishment on June 17 to make way for the attraction's third iteration, opened on July 22, 2025, with the return of the old sponsorship, General Motors. At D23 2024, it was announced that a new lounge, Geo\u201382 and Geo\u201382 Fireworks Experience, would took the place of the former Siemens lounge attached to Spaceship Earth; it opened on June 4, 2025. and it was reserved for adults only.\nOn November 21, 2024, it was announced that the second stage has been installed in the CommuniCore Plaza Stage, and the stage will be the home of \"Joyful! A Celebration of the Season\", as a seasonal entertainment offering during the 2024 annual Epcot International Festival of the Holidays. On March 23, 2025, a fire broke out near the area.\nIn late spring of 2025, Epcot debuted GEO\u201182, a 21-and\u2011over cocktail lounge hidden behind the Spaceship Earth geodesic sphere. The adults-only venue features craft cocktails, small plates, and reservation-only fireworks\u2011viewing experiences. On July 22, 2025, it was announced that Diver Look-Out Chambers would return in the Seas Pavilion, which was became part of the section of World Nature at Epcot, since the demonstration was being temporarily closed and the Future World area was permanently closed due to the COVID-19 pandemic five years ago.\nOn October 5, 2025, it was announced that the Frozen Ever After attraction in the Norway Pavilion at Epcot will receive upgrades, including the audio-animatronic figures, using updated technology currently in use on the newer World of Frozen attraction at Hong Kong Disneyland, when the upgrades could be completed as early as next year. On October 20, 2025, it was announced that two different versions of the attraction as \"Soarin' Around the World\" will be temporarily closed soon to make way for a new film, Soarin' Across America, which will both be premiere on Summer 2026 in Grizzly Peak at Disney California Adventure and in The Land Pavilion at EPCOT's World Nature, for the 250th anniversary celebration of United States. On November 10, 2025, it was announced that the attraction, Remy's Ratatouille Adventure, was temporarily closed for a short refurbishment until it was reopened and debuts a 2D conversion on November 14, 2025 in France Pavilion at EPCOT's World Showcase.\nPark layout and attractions.\nEpcot is divided into four themed areas, known as \"neighborhoods\": World Celebration, World Discovery, World Nature, and World Showcase.\nWorld Celebration, Discovery, and Nature house a variety of avant-garde pavilions that explore innovative aspects and applications including technology and science, with each pavilion featuring self-contained attractions and distinct architecture in its design. Currently, the park features nine major pavilions: Galaxy, Imagination, Journey, Land, Motion, Odyssey, Seas, Space, and Spaceship Earth. World Showcase has eleven individual nation pavilions.\nWorld Celebration, Discovery, and Nature were originally grouped as one area called Future World, which debuted with six pavilions: Spaceship Earth, CommuniCore, Imagination!, The Land, Universe of Energy, and World of Motion. The Horizons pavilion opened the following year, and The Living Seas and Wonders of Life pavilions were added in 1986 and 1989, respectively, bringing the lineup to nine. CommuniCore, World of Motion, Horizons, Wonders of Life, Universe of Energy, and Innoventions closed in 1994, 1996, 1999, 2007, 2017, and 2019, respectively. The Fountain of Nations, a large circular musical fountain which debuted with the park, was removed in 2019 as well. Each pavilion was initially sponsored by a corporation which helped fund its construction and maintenance in return for the corporation's logos and some marketing elements appearing throughout the pavilion.\nAdditionally, each pavilion of Future World featured a unique circular logo designed by Norm Inouye (except for the Wonders of Life logo due to its later introduction), which was featured on park signage and throughout the attractions themselves. The pavilion logos were gradually phased out in the early 2000s, as the pavilions instead were identified by name and recognized by the main attraction(s) housed inside. Several homages remained scattered throughout the park, including merchandising. However, in 2019, the circular pavilion logos were revived as part of the park's transformation, with both classic logos reprised and refreshed and newer logos introduced.\nWorld Celebration.\nWorld Celebration serves as the park's main entrance and a central hub that honors global human interaction and connection, including communication, imagination, creativity, and the visual and culinary arts. The neighborhood features four major pavilions\u2014Spaceship Earth, Imagination, Odyssey, and CommuniCore\u2014as well as additional attractions, shops, and restaurants.\nGuests enter through the main entrance and walk underneath Spaceship Earth, an eighteen-story-tall geodesic sphere structure and the anchor pavilion, which also houses an eponymous dark ride attraction that depicts the history of communication. Directly behind Spaceship Earth are the World Celebration Gardens and Dreamers Point, featuring lush interactive gardens, lighting fixtures and \"Walt the Dreamer\u2014\"a bronze statue commemorating Walt Disney. The Imagination! pavilion celebrates the concept of imagination and features Journey into Imagination with Figment, a dark ride starring Figment that explores the senses. CommuniCore Hall and Plaza is a multi-use pavilion used for exhibitions, gallery space, a mixology bar, a demonstration kitchen, and music performances, as well as meet-and-greets with Disney characters. The Odyssey Pavilion is an exhibition space during the park's annual festivals.\nWorld Celebration is also home to Creations Shop, the park's main gift shop; Connections Eatery &amp; Cafe, a quick-service restaurant and Starbucks themed to global food history; and Club Cool, a Coca-Cola-themed attraction and shop featuring complimentary samples of Coca-Cola soft drinks from around the world.\nWorld Discovery.\nWorld Discovery centers on space, science, transportation, and intergalactic exploration. Lying on the east side of World Celebration, the Discovery neighborhood currently features three major pavilions in clockwise layout.\n, an enclosed spinning roller coaster based on the superhero team of the same name. The building originally opened as Universe of Energy.\n is a centrifugal motion simulator thrill ride that replicates a space flight experience to Mars and a low orbit tour over the surface of Earth. Next to it is Space 220, a themed restaurant simulating dining aboard a space station located two hundred twenty miles high above Earth. The building is located on the original plot site of Horizons.\nTest Track is a high-speed slot car ride inspired by the automobile testing procedures that General Motors uses to evaluate concept cars. The Motion Pavilion was one of the original pavilions of Epcot and has always housed an attraction sponsored by General Motors.\nIn between Guardians of the Galaxy: Cosmic Rewind and Mission: SPACE is one standing but unused pavilion that once housed Wonders of Life.\nWorld Nature.\nWorld Nature focuses on understanding and preserving the beauty, awe and balance of the natural world. Located on the west side of World Celebration, the Nature neighborhood features three major pavilions in counterclockwise layout\u2014inspired by human interaction with the Earth, specifically themes of ocean exploration, hydrology, agriculture, horticulture, ecology, ecotourism, and travel.\nBased on ocean exploration and inspired by the \"Finding Nemo\" series, The Seas pavilion features the sixth-largest aquarium in the world with marine life exhibits; an Omnimover attraction inspired by \"Finding Nemo;\" and Turtle Talk with Crush, an interactive show hosted by Crush from \"Finding Nemo\". Connected to the building is the Coral Reef Restaurant, a themed seafood restaurant that provides views into the aquarium. Nearby is Journey of Water, an outdoor walkthrough water attraction depicting the Earth's water cycle, inspired by \"Moana\". Finally, the Land pavilion features three attractions; Soarin' Around the World, an attraction that simulates a hang gliding flight over various regions of the world; Living with the Land, a narrated boat tour through Audio-Animatronics scenes, a greenhouse and hydroponics lab; and \"Awesome Planet\", a short documentary film presented in the pavilion's Harvest Theater about the Earth's biomes and the perils of climate change.\nWorld Showcase.\nWorld Showcase is the park's largest neighborhood, dedicated to representing the culture, history, cuisine, architecture, and traditions of 11 nations from across four continents\u2014North America, Europe, Asia, and Africa. Each nation pavilion features attractions, shops, restaurants, and landscaping that celebrate or portray authentic settings from each country\u2014several pavilions also contain recreations inspired by existing buildings and landmarks, such as the Eiffel Tower, Itsukushima Shrine, Horyuji Temple, Hampton Court Palace, Ch\u00e2teau Laurier, Gol Stave Church, St Mark's Campanile, and the Kutubiyya Mosque. Of the 11 pavilions, only Morocco and Norway were not present at the park's opening, as they were added in 1984 and 1988 respectively.\nThe nation pavilions surround the World Showcase Lagoon, a man-made lake located in the center of World Showcase with a perimeter of , which is the site of the park's nighttime fireworks display, \"\". In counter-clockwise order, the 11 pavilions are:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nThe American Adventure is the host pavilion of World Showcase, sharing its name with its marquee attraction: Liberty Theater, as a stage show detailing American history and hosted by Audio-Animatronics versions of Benjamin Franklin and Mark Twain. The pavilion also includes the American Heritage Gallery, a changing exhibition space. On the shores of the lagoon is the America Gardens Theatre, an outdoor amphitheater that hosts the park's festival concerts.\nThe France Pavilion hosts \"Impressions de France\" in Palais du Cin\u00e9ma, an 18-minute Cinerama-style film depicting the culture of France, and along with \"Beauty and the Beast: Sing-Along\". Tucked behind the lagoon-facing portion of the pavilion is Remy's Ratatouille Adventure, a 3D dark ride inspired by Pixar\u2019s \"Ratatouille\".\nThe Canada and China Pavilions each host Circle-Vision 360\u00b0 films\u2014\"Canada Far and Wide\" and \"Reflections of China\"\u2014that depict the diverse cultures and countrysides of their respective countries. Two dark boat rides reside within the Norway and Mexico Pavilions\u2014Frozen Ever After and Gran Fiesta Tour Starring The Three Caballeros, respectively\u2014inspired by \"Frozen\" and \"The Three Caballeros\".\nA secondary park gate is located between the France and United Kingdom pavilions of World Showcase and is known as the International Gateway. The International Gateway is directly accessible to guests arriving from the Disney Skyliner and from watercraft transport, and by walkways from the nearby Epcot Area Resorts and Disney's Hollywood Studios.\nEach pavilion contains themed architecture, landscapes, streetscapes, attractions, shops and restaurants representing the respective country's culture and cuisine. In an effort to maintain the authenticity of the represented countries, the pavilions are primarily staffed by citizens of the respective countries as part of Disney's Cultural Representative Program through Q1 visa agreements. Some pavilions also contain themed rides, shows, and live entertainment representative of the respective country. The Morocco pavilion was directly sponsored by the Moroccan government until 2020, when Disney took ownership of the pavilion. The remaining pavilions are primarily sponsored by private companies with affiliations to the represented countries.\nOriginally, the showcase was to include partnerships with the governments of the different countries. According to Disney's 1975 Annual Report, the Showcase would:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nProposed pavilions and unused locations.\nThere are currently seven undeveloped spots for countries around the World Showcase in between the locations of the current countries. Two sites are located on either side of the United Kingdom, one between France and Morocco, one between Morocco and Japan, one between Italy and Germany, and two between Germany and China.\nIn 1982, Disney announced three pavilions were \"coming soon\": Israel, Spain and Equatorial Africa, blending elements of the cultures of countries such as Kenya and Zaire. A model of the Equatorial Africa pavilions was also shown on the opening day telecast. However, the pavilions were never built. Instead, a small African themed refreshment shop known as the \"Outpost\" currently resides in the area between China and Germany, where the Equatorial Africa pavilion was to be located.\nMore than 50 nations, among them, Brazil, Chile, India, Indonesia, Israel, New Zealand, Saudi Arabia, Sweden and five African countries (Eritrea, Ethiopia, Kenya, Namibia, and South Africa), took part in the Millennium Village, a project that took place in Epcot during Millennium Celebration from 1999 to 2001. The Millennium Village was located inside a temporary structure built behind the United Kingdom pavilions that remains in use as World ShowPlace.\nAlcohol policy.\nUnlike Magic Kingdom, which up until 2012 did not serve alcohol, most stores and restaurants at Epcot, especially in the World Showcase, serve and sell a variety of alcoholic beverages including specialty drinks, craft beers, wines, and spirits reflective of the respective countries. The park also hosts the Epcot International Food &amp; Wine Festival, an annual event featuring food and drink samplings from all over the world, along with live entertainment and special exhibits.\nIn June 2025, Disney World introduced GEO-82, an exclusive adult-only lounge at Epcot. GEO-82 offers an elevated experience with premium cocktails, small plates, and unique views of the park's nightly fireworks shows. This new space was designed to provide adult guests with a sophisticated area for relaxation and entertainment, expanding Disney's offerings for grown-up visitors. The lounge represents Disney's focus on diversifying guest experiences and catering to adult audiences.\nSolar Energy\nAs part of Disney's ongoing sustainability initiatives, Epcot has expanded its solar array, which is a crucial part of Disney's commitment to achieving net-zero emissions by 2030. The solar panels, which power parts of the park, significantly reduce the resort's carbon footprint. This effort reflects Disney's broader goal of incorporating renewable energy sources across its parks worldwide.\nSustainability\nDisney is actively engaged in water conservation across its parks and resorts, aiming to reduce potable water consumption through various initiatives. At Epcot in Walt Disney World Resort, the irrigation system has been switched to reclaimed water, enhancing water efficiency. These efforts are part of Disney's broader environmental strategy, which includes implementing site-specific watershed stewardship strategies at key locations. By focusing on both operational water conservation and investments to protect local natural water systems, Disney aims to contribute to the sustainable management of water resources.\nAnnual events.\nEpcot hosts a number of special events during the year:\nAttendance.\nThe Walt Disney Company generally does not publish attendance figures for its theme parks, so industry groups such as the Themed Entertainment Association estimate these figures.\nOther uses.\nThe model of Epcot Center was used by the Brazilian broadcaster TV Globo in its 1989 ident.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Adjacent stations/styles.css\"/&gt;"}

Founded on October 16, 1923, as an animation studio by brothers Walt Disney and Roy Oliver Disney as Disney Brothers Cartoon Studio, Disney operated under the names Walt Disney Studio and Walt Disney Productions before adopting its current name in 1986. In 1928, Disney established itself as a leader in the animation industry with the short film \"Steamboat Willie.\" The film used synchronized sound to become the first post-produced sound cartoon, and popularized Mickey Mouse, who became Disney's mascot and corporate icon.\nAfter becoming a success by the early 1940s, Disney diversified into live-action films, television, and theme parks in the 1950s. However, following Walt Disney's death in 1966, the company's profits, especially in the animation sector, began to decline. In 1984, Disney's shareholders voted Michael Eisner as CEO, who led a reversal of the company's decline through a combination of international theme park expansion and the highly successful Disney Renaissance period of animation from 1989 to 1999. In 2005, under the new CEO Bob Iger, the company continued to expand into a major entertainment conglomerate with the acquisitions of Pixar in 2006, Marvel Entertainment in 2009, Lucasfilm in 2012, and 21st Century Fox in 2019. In 2020, Bob Chapek became the head of Disney after Iger's retirement. However, Chapek was ousted in 2022 and Iger was reinstated as CEO.\nDisney operates the largest television and film studio in Hollywood. Walt Disney Studios includes Walt Disney Pictures, Walt Disney Animation Studios, Pixar, Marvel Studios, Lucasfilm, 20th Century Studios, 20th Century Animation, and Searchlight Pictures. Disney's other main business units include divisions operating the ABC television network; cable television networks such as Disney Channel, ESPN, Freeform, FX, and National Geographic; publishing, merchandising, music, and theater divisions; direct-to-consumer streaming services such as Disney+, ESPN+, Hulu, and Hotstar; and Disney Experiences, which includes several theme parks, resort hotels, and cruise lines around the world.\nDisney is one of the biggest and best-known companies in the world. In 2023, it was ranked 87th on the 2023 \"Forbes\" Global 2000, and 48th on the \"Fortune\" 500 list of biggest companies in the United States by revenue. Since its founding, the company has won 135 Academy Awards, 26 of which were awarded to Walt. The company has produced films which have been featured on many lists of the greatest films of all time and is one of the key players on the development of the theme park industry. The company has been public since 1940 and trades on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and has been a component of the Dow Jones Industrial Average since 1991. In August 2020, about two-thirds of the stock was owned by large financial institutions. The company celebrated its 100th anniversary on October 16, 2023.\nHistory.\n1921\u20131934: Founding, Oswald the Lucky Rabbit, Mickey Mouse, and \"Silly Symphonies\".\nIn 1921, American animators Walt Disney and Ub Iwerks founded Laugh-O-Gram Studio in Kansas City, Missouri. Iwerks and Disney went on to create short films at the studio. The final one, in 1923, was entitled \"Alice's Wonderland\" and depicted child actress Virginia Davis interacting with animated characters. While Laugh-O-Gram's shorts were popular in Kansas City, the studio went bankrupt in 1923 and Disney moved to Los Angeles, to join his brother Roy O. Disney, who was recovering from tuberculosis. Shortly after Walt's move, New York film distributor Margaret J. Winkler purchased \"Alice's Wonderland\", which began to gain popularity. Disney signed a contract with Winkler for $1,500 to create six series of \"Alice Comedies\", with an option for two more six-episode series. Walt and Roy Disney founded \"Disney Brothers Cartoon Studio\" on October 16, 1923, to produce the films. In January 1926, the Disney's moved into a new studio on Hyperion Street and the studio's name was changed to Walt Disney Studio.\nAfter producing \"Alice\" films over the next 4 years, Winkler handed the role of distributing the studio's shorts to her husband, Charles Mintz. In 1927, Mintz asked for a new series, and Disney created his first series of fully animated shorts, starring a character named Oswald the Lucky Rabbit. The series was produced by Winkler Pictures and distributed by Universal Pictures. The Walt Disney Studios completed 26 Oswald shorts.\nIn 1928, Disney and Mintz entered into a contract dispute, with Disney asking for a larger fee, while Mintz sought to reduce the price. Disney discovered Universal Pictures owned the intellectual property rights to Oswald, and Mintz threatened to produce the shorts without him if he did not accept the reduction in payment. Disney declined and Mintz signed 4 of Walt Disney Studio's primary animators to start his own studio; Iwerks was the only top animator to remain with the Disney brothers. Disney and Iwerks replaced Oswald with a mouse character originally named Mortimer Mouse, before Disney's wife urged him to change the name to Mickey Mouse. In May 1928, Mickey Mouse debuted in test screenings of the shorts \"Plane Crazy\" and \"The Gallopin' Gaucho\". Later that year, the studio produced \"Steamboat Willie\", its first sound film and third short in the Mickey Mouse series, which was made using synchronized sound, becoming the first post-produced sound cartoon. The sound was created using Powers' Cinephone system, which used Lee de Forest's Phonofilm system. Pat Powers' company distributed \"Steamboat Willie\", which was an immediate hit. In 1929, the company successfully re-released the two earlier films with synchronized sound.\nAfter the release of \"Steamboat Willie\" at the Colony Theater in New York, Mickey Mouse became an immensely popular character. Disney Brothers Studio made several cartoons featuring Mickey and other characters. In August 1929, the company began making the \"Silly Symphony\" series with Columbia Pictures as the distributor, because the Disney brothers felt they were not receiving their share of profits from Powers. Powers ended his contract with Iwerks, who later started his own studio. Carl W. Stalling played an important role in starting the series, and composed the music for early films but left the company after Iwerks' departure. In September, theater manager Harry Woodin requested permission to start a Mickey Mouse Club at his theater the Fox Dome to boost attendance. Disney agreed, but David E. Dow started the first-such club at Elsinore Theatre before Woodin could start his. On December 21, the first meeting at Elsinore Theatre was attended by around 1,200 children. On July 24, 1930, Joseph Conley, president of King Features Syndicate, wrote to the Disney studio and asked the company to produce a Mickey Mouse comic strip; production started in November and samples were sent to King Features. On December 16, 1930, the Walt Disney Studios partnership was reorganized as a corporation with the name Walt Disney Productions, Limited, which had a merchandising division named Walt Disney Enterprises, and subsidiaries called Disney Film Recording Company, Limited and Liled Realty and Investment Company; the latter of which managed real estate holdings. Walt Disney and his wife held 60% (6,000 shares) of the company, and Roy Disney owned 40%.\nThe comic strip \"Mickey Mouse\" debuted on January 13, 1930, in \"New York Daily Mirror\" and by 1931, the strip was published in 60 newspapers in the US, and in 20 other countries. After realizing releasing merchandise based on the characters would generate more revenue, a man in New York offered Disney $300 for license to put Mickey Mouse on writing tablets he was manufacturing. Disney accepted and Mickey Mouse became the first licensed character. In 1933, Disney asked Kay Kamen, the owner of a Kansas City advertising firm, to run Disney's merchandising; Kamen agreed and transformed Disney's merchandising. Within a year, Kamen had 40 licenses for Mickey Mouse and within two years, had made $35\u00a0million worth of sales. In 1934, Disney said he made more money from the merchandising of Mickey Mouse than from the character's films.\nThe Waterbury Clock Company created a Mickey Mouse watch, which became so popular it saved the company from bankruptcy during the Great Depression. During a promotional event at Macy's, 11,000 Mickey Mouse watches sold in one day; and within two years, two-and-a-half million watches were sold. As Mickey Mouse become a heroic character rather than a mischievous one, Disney needed another character that could produce gags. Disney invited radio presenter Clarence Nash to the animation studio; Disney wanted to use Nash to play Donald Duck, a talking duck that would be the studio's new gag character. Donald Duck made his first appearance in 1934 in \"The Wise Little Hen.\" Though he did not become popular as quickly as Mickey had, Donald Duck had a featured role in \"Donald and Pluto\" (1936) and was given his own series.\nAfter a disagreement with Columbia Pictures about the \"Silly Symphony\" cartoons, Disney signed a distribution contract with United Artists from 1932 to 1937 to distribute them. In 1932, Disney signed an exclusive contract with Technicolor to produce cartoons in color until the end of 1935, beginning with the \"Silly Symphony\" short \"Flowers and Trees\" (1932). The film was the first full-color cartoon and won the Academy Award for Best Cartoon. In 1933, \"The Three Little Pigs\", another popular \"Silly Symphony\" short, was released and also won the Academy Award for Best Cartoon. The song from the film \"Who's Afraid of the Big Bad Wolf?\", which was composed by Frank Churchill\u2014who wrote other \"Silly Symphonies\" songs\u2014became popular and remained so throughout the 1930s, and became one of the best-known Disney songs. Other \"Silly Symphonies\" films won the Best Cartoon award from 1931 to 1939, except for 1938, when another Disney film, \"Ferdinand the Bull\", won it.\n1934\u20131949: Golden Age of Animation, strike, and wartime era.\nIn 1934, Walt Disney announced a feature-length animated film, \"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\". It would be the first cel animated feature and the first animated feature produced in the US. Its novelty made it a risky venture; Roy tried to persuade Walt not to produce it, arguing it would bankrupt the studio, and while widely anticipated by the public, it was referred to by some critics as \"Disney's Folly\". Walt directed the animators to take a realistic approach, creating scenes as though they were live action. While making the film, the company created the multiplane camera, consisting of pieces of glass upon which drawings were placed at different distances to create an illusion of depth in the backgrounds. After United Artists attempted to attain future television rights to the Disney shorts, Walt signed a distribution contract with RKO Radio Pictures on March 2, 1936. Walt Disney Productions exceeded its original budget of $150,000 for \"Snow White\" by ten times; its production eventually cost the company $1.5\u00a0million.\n\"Snow White\" took 3 years to make, premiering on December 12, 1937. It was an immediate critical and commercial success, becoming the highest-grossing film up to that point, grossing $8\u00a0million ( dollars); after re-releases, it grossed a total of $998,440,000 in the US adjusted for inflation. Using the profits from \"Snow White\", Disney financed the construction of a new 51-acre studio complex in Burbank, which the company fully moved into in 1940 and where the company is still headquartered. In April 1940, Disney Productions had its initial public offering, with the common stock remaining with Disney and his family. Disney did not want to go public, but the company needed the money.\nShortly before \"Snow White's\" release, work began on the company's next features, \"Pinocchio\" and \"Bambi\". \"Pinocchio\" was released in February 1940 while \"Bambi\" was postponed. Despite \"Pinocchio\"'s critical acclaim (it won the Academy Awards for Best Song and Best Score and was lauded for groundbreaking achievements in animation), the film performed poorly at the box office, due to World War II affecting the international box office.\nThe company's third feature \"Fantasia\" (1940) introduced groundbreaking advancements in cinema technology, chiefly Fantasound, an early surround sound system making it the first commercial film to be shown in stereo. However, \"Fantasia\" similarly performed poorly at the box office. In 1941, the company experienced a major setback when 300 of its 800 animators, led by one of the top animators Art Babbitt, went on strike for 5 weeks for unionization and higher pay. Walt Disney publicly accused the strikers of being party to a communist conspiracy and fired many of them, including some of the studio's best. Roy unsuccessfully attempted to persuade the company's main distributors to invest in the studio, which could no longer afford to offset production costs with employee layoffs. The anthology film \"The Reluctant Dragon\" (1941) ran $100,000 short of its production cost, contributing to the studio's financial woes.\nWhile negotiations to end the strike were underway, Walt and studio animators embarked on a 12-week goodwill visit to South America, funded by the Office of the Coordinator of Inter-American Affairs. During the trip, the animators began plotting films, taking inspiration from the local environments and music. As a result of the strike, federal mediators compelled the studio to recognize the Screen Cartoonist's Guild and several animators left, leaving it with 694 employees. To recover from financial losses, Disney rushed the studio's 4th animated feature \"Dumbo\" (1941) into production on a reduced budget; this performed well at the box office, infusing the studio with much needed cash. After US entry into World War II, many of the company's animators were drafted into the army. 500 United States Army soldiers occupied the studio for 8 months to protect a nearby Lockheed aircraft plant. While they were there, the soldiers fixed equipment in large soundstages and converted storage sheds into ammunition depots. The United States Navy asked Disney to produce propaganda films to gain support for the war, and with the studio badly in need of profits, Disney agreed, signing a contract for 20 war-related shorts for $90,000. Most of the company's employees worked on the project, which spawned films such as \"Victory Through Air Power\", and others which included some of the company's characters.\nIn August 1942, Disney released its fifth feature film, \"Bambi,\" after five years in development, and performed poorly at the box office. Later, as products of the South American trip, Disney released the features \"Saludos Amigos\" (1942) and \"The Three Caballeros\" (1944). This was a new strategy of releasing package films, collections of short cartoons grouped to make feature films. Both performed poorly. Disney released more package films through the rest of the decade, including \"Make Mine Music\" (1946)\", Fun and Fancy Free\" (1947), \"Melody Time\" (1948), and \"The Adventures of Ichabod and Mr. Toad\" (1949), to try to recover from its financial losses. Disney began producing less-expensive live-action films mixed with animation, beginning with \"Song of the South\" (1946) which would become one of Disney's most controversial films. As a result of its financial problems, Disney began re-releasing its feature films in 1944. In 1948, it began premiering the nature documentary series, \"True-Life Adventures\", which ran until 1960, winning 8 Academy Awards. In 1949, the Walt Disney Music Company was founded to help with profits for merchandising.\n1950\u20131967: Live-action films, television, Disneyland, and Walt Disney's death.\nIn the 1950s, Disney returned to producing full-length animated feature films, beginning with \"Cinderella\" (1950), its first feature in eight years. A critical and commercial success, \"Cinderella\" saved Disney after the financial pitfalls of the wartime era; it was its most financially successful film since \"Snow White\", making $8\u00a0million in its first year. Walt began to reduce his involvement with animation, focusing his attention on the studio's increasingly diverse portfolio of projects, including live-action films (of which \"Treasure Island\" was the studio's first), television and amusement parks. In 1950 the company made its first foray into television when NBC aired \"One Hour in Wonderland\", a promotional program for Disney's next animated film, \"Alice in Wonderland\" (1951), and sponsored by Coca-Cola. \"Alice\" was financially unsuccessful, falling $1\u00a0million short of the production budget. In February 1953, Disney's next animated film \"Peter Pan\" was released to financial success; it was the last Disney film distributed by RKO after Disney ended its contract and created its own distribution company Buena Vista Distribution.\nAccording to Walt, he first had the idea of building an amusement park during a visit to Griffith Park with his daughters. He said he watched them ride a carousel and thought there \"should be\u00a0... some kind of amusement enterprise built where the parents and the children could have fun together\". Initially planning the construction of an eight-acre (3.2 ha) Mickey Mouse Park near the Burbank studio, Walt changed the planned amusement park's name to Disneylandia, then to Disneyland. A new company, WED Enterprises (now Walt Disney Imagineering), was formed in 1952 to design and construct the park. Drawing inspiration from amusement parks in the US and Europe, Walt approached the design of Disneyland with an emphasis on thematic storytelling and cleanliness, innovative approaches for amusement parks of the time. The plan to build the park in Burbank was abandoned when Walt realized 8 acres would not be enough to accomplish his vision. Disney acquired 160 acres (65\u00a0ha) of orange groves in Anaheim, southeast of LA in neighboring Orange County, at $6,200 per acre to build the park. Construction began in July 1954. Walt formed a new company called Retlaw to handle his personal business, primarily Carolwood Pacific Railroad. \nTo finance the construction of Disneyland, Disney sold his home at Smoke Tree Ranch in Palm Springs and the company promoted it with a television series of the same name aired on ABC. The \"Disneyland\" television series, which would be the first in a long-running series of successful anthology television programs for the company, was a success and garnered over 50% of viewers in its time slot, along with praise from critics. In August, Walt formed another company Disneyland, Inc. to finance the park, whose construction costs totaled $17\u00a0million.\nIn October, with the success of \"Disneyland,\" ABC allowed Disney to produce \"The Mickey Mouse Club\", a variety show for children; the show included a daily Disney cartoon, a children's newsreel, and a talent show. It was presented by a host, and talented children and adults called \"Mousketeers\" and \"Mooseketeers\", respectively. After the first season, over ten million children and five million adults watched it daily; and two million Mickey Mouse ears, which the cast wore, were sold. In December 1954, the five-part miniseries \"Davy Crockett,\" premiered as part of \"Disneyland\", starring Fess Parker. According to writer Neal Gabler, \"[It] became an overnight national sensation\", selling 10 million Crockett coonskin caps. The show's theme song \"The Ballad of Davy Crockett\" became part of American pop culture, selling 10 million records. \"Los Angeles Times\" called it \"the greatest merchandising fad the world had ever seen\". In June 1955, Disney's 15th animated film \"Lady and the Tramp\" was released and performed better at the box office than any other Disney films since \"Snow White\".\nDisneyland opened on July 17, 1955; it was a major media event, broadcast live on ABC with actors Art Linkletter, Bob Cummings, and Ronald Reagan hosting. It garnered over 90 million viewers, becoming the most-watched live broadcast to that date. While the park's opening day was disastrous (restaurants ran out of food, the Mark Twain Riverboat began to sink, other rides malfunctioned, and the drinking fountains were not working in the 100\u00a0\u00b0F. (38\u00a0\u00b0C) heat), the park became a success with 161,657 visitors in its first week and 20,000 visitors a day in its first month. After its first year, 3.6\u00a0million people had visited, and after its second year, four million more guests came, making it more popular than the Grand Canyon and Yellowstone National Park. That year, the company earned a gross total of $24.5\u00a0million compared to the $11\u00a0million the previous year.\nDisney continued to delegate much of the animation work to the studio's top animators, known as the Nine Old Men. The company produced an average of five films per year throughout the 1950s and 60s. Animated features of this period included \"Sleeping Beauty\" (1959), \"One Hundred and One Dalmatians\" (1961), and \"The Sword in the Stone\" (1963). \"Sleeping Beauty\" was a financial loss for the company, and at $6\u00a0million, had the highest production costs up to that point. \"One Hundred and One Dalmatians\" introduced an animation technique using the xerography process to electromagnetically transfer the drawings to animation cels, resulting in a transformed art style for the studio's animated films. In 1956, the Sherman Brothers, Robert and Richard, were asked to produce a theme song for the television series \"Zorro\". The company hired them as exclusive staff songwriters, an arrangement that lasted 10 years. They wrote many songs for Disney's films and theme parks, and several were commercial hits. In the late 1950s, Disney ventured into comedy with the live-action films \"The Shaggy Dog\" (1959), which became the highest-grossing film in the US and Canada for Disney at over $9\u00a0million, and \"The Absent Minded Professor\" (1961), both starring Fred MacMurray.\nDisney also made live-action films based on children's books including \"Pollyanna\" (1960) and \"Swiss Family Robinson\" (1960). Child actor Hayley Mills starred in \"Pollyanna\", for which she won an Academy Juvenile Award. Mills starred in 5 other Disney films, including a dual role as the twins in \"The Parent Trap\" (1961). Another child actor, Kevin Corcoran, was prominent in many Disney live-action films, first appearing in a serial for \"The Mickey Mouse Club,\" where he would play a boy named Moochie. He worked alongside Mills in \"Pollyanna\", and starred in features such as \"Old Yeller\" (1957), \"Toby Tyler\" (1960), and \"Swiss Family Robinson\". In 1964, the live action/animation musical film \"Mary Poppins\" was released to major commercial success and rapturous critical acclaim, becoming the year's highest-grossing film and winning five Academy Awards, including Best Actress for Julie Andrews as Poppins and Best Song for the Sherman Brothers, who also won Best Score for the film's \"Chim Chim Cher-ee\".\nThroughout the 1960s, Dean Jones, whom \"The Guardian\" called \"the figure who most represented Walt Disney Productions in the 1960s\", starred in 10 Disney films, including \"That Darn Cat!\" (1965), \"The Ugly Dachshund\" (1966), and \"The Love Bug\" (1968). Disney's last child actor of the 1960s was Kurt Russell, who had signed a ten-year contract. He featured in films such as \"The Computer Wore Tennis Shoes\" (1969), \"The Horse in the Gray Flannel Suit\" (1968) alongside Dean Jones, \"The Barefoot Executive\" (1971), and \"The Strongest Man in the World\" (1975).\nIn late 1959, Walt had an idea to build another park in Palm Beach, Florida, called the City of Tomorrow, a city that would be full of technological improvements. In 1964, the company chose land southwest of Orlando, Florida to build the park and acquired 27,000 acres (10,927\u00a0ha). On November 15, 1965, Walt, along with Roy and Florida's governor Haydon Burns, announced plans for a park called Disney World, which included Magic Kingdom\u2014\u200ca larger version of Disneyland\u200d\u2014\u200cand the City of Tomorrow, at the park's center. By 1967, the company had made expansions to Disneyland, and more rides were added in 1966 and 1967, at a cost of $20\u00a0million. The new rides included Walt Disney's Enchanted Tiki Room, which was the first attraction to use Audio-Animatronics; Walt Disney's Carousel of Progress, which debuted at the 1964 New York World's Fair before moving to Disneyland in 1967; and Dumbo the Flying Elephant.\nOn November 20, 1964, Walt sold most of WED Enterprise to Walt Disney Productions for $3.8\u00a0million after being persuaded by Roy, who thought Walt having his own company would cause legal problems. When Disney started looking for a sponsor for the Florida project, Walt renamed the City of Tomorrow as the Experimental Prototype Community of Tomorrow (EPCOT). Walt, who had been a heavy smoker since World War I, fell very sick and he died on December 15, 1966, aged 65, of lung cancer, at St. Joseph Hospital across the street from the studio.\n1967\u20131984: Roy O. Disney's leadership and death, Walt Disney World, animation industry decline, and Touchstone Pictures.\nIn 1967, the last two films Walt had worked on were released; the animated film \"The Jungle Book\", which was Disney's most successful film for the next two decades, and the live-action musical \"The Happiest Millionaire\". After Walt's death, the company largely abandoned animation, but made several live-action films. Its animation staff declined from 500 to 125 employees, with the company only hiring 21 people from 1970 to 1977.\nDisney's first post-Walt animated film \"The Aristocats\" was released in 1970; according to Dave Kehr of \"Chicago Tribune\", \"the absence of his [Walt's] hand is evident\". The following year, the anti-fascist musical \"Bedknobs and Broomsticks\" was released and won the Oscar for Best Special Visual Effects. At the time of Walt's death, Roy was ready to retire but wanted to keep Walt's legacy alive; he became the first CEO and chairman of the company. In May 1967, Roy had legislation passed by Florida's legislatures to grant Disney World its own quasi-government agency in an area called Reedy Creek Improvement District. Roy changed Disney World's name to Walt Disney World to memorialize Walt. EPCOT became less the City of Tomorrow, and was shelved and eventually transformed into another theme park.\nAfter 18 months of construction at a cost of around $400\u00a0million, Walt Disney World's first park the Magic Kingdom, along with Disney's Contemporary Resort and Disney's Polynesian Resort, opened on October 1, 1971, with 10,400 visitors. A parade with over 1,000 band members, 4,000 Disney entertainers, and a choir from the US Army marched down Main Street. The icon of the park was the Cinderella Castle. On Thanksgiving Day, cars traveling to the Magic Kingdom caused traffic jams along interstate roads.\nOn December 21, 1971, Roy died of cerebral hemorrhage at St. Joseph Hospital. Donn Tatum, a senior executive and former president of Disney, became the first non-Disney-family-member to become CEO and chairman. Card Walker, who had been with the company since 1938, became its president. By June 30, 1973, Disney had over 23,000 employees and a gross revenue of $257,751,000 over a nine-month period, compared to the year before when it made $220,026,000. In November, Disney released the animated film \"Robin Hood\" (1973), which became Disney's biggest international-grossing movie at $18\u00a0million. Throughout the 1970s, Disney released live-action films such as \"The Computer Wore Tennis Shoes\"' sequel \"Now You See Him, Now You Don't\"; \"The Love Bug\" sequels \"Herbie Rides Again\" (1974) and \"Herbie Goes to Monte Carlo\" (1977); \"Escape to Witch Mountain\" (1975); and \"Freaky Friday\" (1976). In 1976, Card Walker became CEO of the company, with Tatum remaining chairman until 1980, when Walker replaced him. In 1977, Roy E. Disney, Roy O. Disney's son and the only Disney working for the company, resigned as an executive because of disagreements with company decisions.\nIn 1977, Disney released the successful animated film \"The Rescuers\", which grossed $48\u00a0million. The live action/animated musical \"Pete's Dragon\" was released in 1977, grossing $16\u00a0million in the US and Canada, but was a disappointment to the company. In 1979, Disney's first PG-rated film and most expensive film to that point at $26\u00a0million \"The Black Hole\" was released, showing Disney could use special effects. It grossed $35\u00a0million, a disappointment to the company, which thought it would be a hit like \"Star Wars\" (1977). \"The Black Hole\" was a response to other Science fiction films of the era.\nIn September, 12 animators, which was over 15% of the department, resigned. Led by Don Bluth, they left because of a conflict with the training program and the atmosphere, and started their own company Don Bluth Productions. In 1981, Disney released \"Dumbo\" to VHS and \"Alice in Wonderland\" the following year, leading Disney to eventually release all its films on home media. On July 24, Walt Disney's World on Ice, a two-year tour of ice shows featuring Disney charters, made its premiere at the Brendan Byrne Meadowlands Arena after Disney licensed its characters to Feld Entertainment. The same month, Disney's animated film \"The Fox and the Hound\" was released and became the highest-grossing animated film to that point at $40\u00a0million. It was the first film that did not involve Walt and the last major work done by Disney's Nine Old Men, who were replaced with younger animators.\nAs profits started to decline, on October 1, 1982, Epcot, then known as EPCOT Center, opened as the second theme park in Walt Disney World, with around 10,000 people in attendance during the opening. The park cost over $900\u00a0million to construct, and consisted of the Future World pavilion and World Showcase representing Mexico, China, Germany, Italy, America, Japan, France, the UK, and Canada; Morocco and Norway were added in 1984 and 1988, respectively. The animation industry continued to decline and 69% of the company's profits were from its theme parks; in 1982, there were 12 million visitors to Walt Disney World, a figure that declined by 5% the following June. On July 9, 1982, Disney released \"Tron\", one of the first films to extensively use computer-generated imagery (CGI). It was a big influence on other CGI movies, though it received mixed reviews. In 1982, the company lost $27\u00a0million.\nOn April 15, 1983, Disney's first park outside the US, Tokyo Disneyland, opened in Urayasu. Costing around $1.4\u00a0billion, construction started in 1979 when Disney and the Oriental Land Company agreed to build a park together. Within its first ten years, the park had over 140 million visitors. After an investment of $100\u00a0million, on April 18, Disney started a pay-to-watch cable television channel called Disney Channel, a 16-hours-a-day service showing Disney films, twelve programs, and two magazines shows for adults. Although it was expected to do well, the company lost $48\u00a0million after its first year, with around 916,000 subscribers.\nIn 1983, Walt's son-in-law Ron W. Miller, who had been president since 1978, became its CEO, and Raymond Watson became chairman. Miller wanted the studio to produce more content for mature audiences, and Disney founded film distribution label Touchstone Pictures to produce films geared toward adults and teenagers in 1984. \"Splash\" (1984) was the first film released under the label, and a much-needed success, grossing over $6\u00a0million in its first week. Disney's first R-rated film \"Down and Out in Beverly Hills\" (1986) was released and was another hit, grossing $62\u00a0million. The following year, Disney's first PG-13 rated film \"Adventures in Babysitting\" was released. In 1984, Saul Steinberg attempted to buy out the company, holding 11% of the stocks. He offered to buy 49% for $1.3\u00a0billion or the entire company for $2.75\u00a0billion. Disney, which had less than $10\u00a0million, rejected Steinberg's offer and offered to buy all of his stock for $326\u00a0million. Steinberg agreed, and Disney paid it all with part of a $1.3\u00a0billion bank loan, putting the company $866\u00a0million in debt.\n1984\u20132005: Michael Eisner's leadership, the Disney Renaissance, merger, and acquisitions.\nIn 1984, shareholders Roy E. Disney, Sid Bass, Lillian and Diane Disney, and Irwin L. Jacobs\u2014who together owned about 36% of the shares, forced out CEO Miller and replaced him with Michael Eisner, a former president of Paramount Pictures, and appointed Frank Wells as president. Eisner's first act was to make it a major film studio, which at the time it was not considered. Eisner appointed Jeffrey Katzenberg as chairman and Roy E. Disney as head of animation. Eisner wanted to produce an animated film every 18 months rather than four years, as the company had been doing. To help with the film division, the company started making Saturday-morning cartoons to create new Disney characters for merchandising and produced films through Touchstone. Under Eisner, Disney became more involved with television, creating Touchstone Television and producing the television sitcom \"The Golden Girls\", which was a hit. The company spent $15\u00a0million promoting its theme parks, raising visitor numbers by 10%. In 1984, Disney produced \"The Black Cauldron\", then the most-expensive animated movie at $40\u00a0million, its first animated film to feature computer-generated imagery, and its first PG-rated animation because of its adult themes. The film was a box-office failure, leading the company to move the animation department from the studio in Burbank to a warehouse in Glendale, California. The film-financing partnership Silver Screen Partners II, which was organized in 1985, financed films for Disney with $193\u00a0million. In January 1987, Silver Screen Partners III began financing movies for Disney with $300\u00a0million raised by E.F. Hutton, the largest amount raised for a film-financing limited partnership. Silver Screen IV was also set up to finance Disney's studios.\nIn 1986, the company changed its name from Walt Disney Productions to the Walt Disney Company, stating the old name only referred to the film industry. With Disney's animation industry declining, the animation department needed its next movie \"The Great Mouse Detective\" to be a success. It grossed $25\u00a0million at the box office, becoming a much-needed financial success. To generate more revenue from merchandising, the company opened its first retail store Disney Store in Glendale in 1987. Because of its success, the company opened two more in California, and by 1990, it had 215 throughout the United States. In 1989, the company garnered $411\u00a0million in revenue and made a profit of $187\u00a0million. In 1987, the company signed an agreement with the Government of France to build a resort named Euro Disneyland in Paris; it would consist of two theme parks named Disneyland Park and Walt Disney Studios Park, a golf course, and 6 hotels.\nIn 1988, Disney's 27th animated film \"Oliver &amp; Company\" was released the same day as that of former Disney animator Don Bluth's \"The Land Before Time\". \"Oliver &amp; Company\" out-competed \"The Land Before Time\", becoming the first animated film to gross over $100\u00a0million in its initial release, and the highest-grossing animated film in its initial run. Disney became the box-office-leading Hollywood studio for the first time, with films such as \"Who Framed Roger Rabbit\" (1988), \"Three Men and a Baby\" (1987)\",\" and \"Good Morning, Vietnam\" (1987). The company's gross revenue went from $165\u00a0million in 1983 to $876\u00a0million in 1987, and operating income went from \u2212$33\u00a0million in 1983 to +130\u00a0million in 1987. The studio's net income rose by 66%, along with a 26% growth in revenue. \"Los Angeles Times\" called Disney's recovery \"a real rarity in the corporate world\". On May 1, 1989, Disney opened Disney-MGM Studios, its third amusement park at Walt Disney World, and later became Hollywood Studios. The new park demonstrated to visitors the movie-making process, until 2008, when it was changed to make guests feel they are in movies. Following the opening of Disney-MGM Studios, Disney opened the water park Typhoon Lagoon in June 1989; in 2022 it had 1.9\u00a0million visitors and was the most popular water park in the world. Also in 1989, Disney signed an agreement-in-principle to acquire The Jim Henson Company from its founder. The deal included Henson's programming library and Muppet characters\u2014excluding the Muppets created for \"Sesame Street\"\u2014as well as Henson's personal creative services. Henson, however, died in May 1990 before the deal was completed, resulting in the companies terminating merger negotiations.\nOn November 17, 1989, Disney released \"The Little Mermaid\", which was the start of the Disney Renaissance, a period in which the company released hugely successful and critically acclaimed animated films. \"The Little Mermaid\" became the animated film with the highest gross from its initial run and garnered $233\u00a0million at the box office; it won two Academy Awards; Best Original Score and Best Original Song for \"Under the Sea\". During the Disney Renaissance, composer Alan Menken and lyricist Howard Ashman wrote several Disney songs until Ashman died in 1991. Together they wrote 6 songs nominated for Academy Awards; with two winning songs\u2014\"Under the Sea\" and \"Beauty and the Beast\". To produce music geared for the mainstream, including music for movie soundtracks, Disney founded the recording label Hollywood Records on January 1, 1990. In September 1990, Disney arranged for financing of up to $200\u00a0million by a unit of Nomura Securities for Interscope films made for Disney. On October 23, Disney formed Touchwood Pacific Partners, which replaced the Silver Screen Partnership series as the company's movie studios' primary source of funding. Disney's first animated sequel \"The Rescuers Down Under\" was released on November 16, 1990, and created using Computer Animation Production System (CAPS), digital software developed by Disney and Pixar\u2014the computer division of Lucasfilm\u2014becoming the first feature film to be entirely created digitally. Although the film struggled in the box office, grossing $47\u00a0million, it received positive reviews. In 1991, Disney and Pixar agreed to a deal to make three films together, the first one being \"Toy Story\".\nDow Jones &amp; Company, wanting to replace 3 companies in its industrial average, chose to add Disney in May 1991, stating Disney \"reflects the importance of entertainment and leisure activities in the economy\". Disney's next animated film \"Beauty and the Beast\" was released on November 13, 1991, and grossed nearly $430\u00a0million. It was the first animated film to win a Golden Globe for Best Picture, and it received 6 Academy Award nominations, becoming the first animation nominated for Best Picture; it won Best Score, Best Sound, and Best Song. The film was critically acclaimed, with some critics considering it to be the best Disney film. To coincide with the 1992 release of \"The Mighty Ducks\", Disney founded the National Hockey League team The Mighty Ducks of Anaheim. Disney's next animated feature \"Aladdin\" was released on November 11, 1992, and grossed $504\u00a0million, becoming the highest-grossing animated film to that point, and the first animated film to gross a half-billion dollars. It won two Academy Awards\u2014Best Song for \"A Whole New World\" and Best Score; and \"A Whole New World\" was the first-and-only Disney song to win the Grammy for Song of the Year. For $60\u00a0million, Disney broadened its range of mature-audience films by acquiring independent film distributor Miramax Films in 1993. The same year, in a venture with The Nature Conservancy, Disney purchased 8,500 acres (3,439\u00a0ha) of Everglades headwaters in Florida to protect native animals and plant species, establishing the Disney Wilderness Preserve.\nOn April 3, 1994, Frank Wells died in a helicopter crash; he, Eisner, and Katzenberg helped the company's market value go from $2\u00a0billion to $22\u00a0billion since taking office in 1984. On June 15 the same year, \"The Lion King\" was released and was a massive success, becoming the second-highest-grossing film of all time behind \"Jurassic Park\" and the highest-grossing animated film of all time, with a gross total of $969\u00a0million. It was critically praised and garnered two Academy Awards\u2014Best Score and Best Song for \"Can You Feel the Love Tonight\". Soon after its release, Katzenberg left the company after Eisner refused to promote him to president. After leaving, he co-founded film studio DreamWorks SKG. Wells was later replaced with one of Eisner's friends Michael Ovitz on August 13, 1995. In 1994, Disney wanted to buy one of the major US television networks ABC, NBC, or CBS, which would give the company guaranteed distribution for its programming. Eisner planned to buy NBC, but the deal was canceled because General Electric wanted to keep a majority stake. In 1994, Disney's annual revenue reached $10\u00a0billion, 48% coming from film, 34% from theme parks, and 18% from merchandising. Disney's total net income was up 25% from the previous year at $1.1\u00a0billion. Grossing over $346\u00a0million, \"Pocahontas\" was released on June 16, garnering the Academy Awards for Best Musical or Comedy Score and Best Song for \"Colors of the Wind\".

Disney has also been criticized for filming in the autonomous region of Xinjiang, where human rights abuses are taking place.\nRacism.\nSeveral of Disney's films have been considered to be racist; one of the company's most-controversial films \"Song of the South\" was criticized for portraying racial stereotypes. For that reason, the film was never released to home video in the United States or Disney+. Other characters that have been called racist are Sunflower, a black centaurette who serves a white centaurette in \"Fantasia\"; the Siamese cats in \"Lady and the Tramp\", who are considered to be overexaggerated as Asians; stereotypes of Native Americans in \"Peter Pan\"; and crows in \"Dumbo\", who are depicted as African Americans who use jive talk, with their leader being named Jim Crow, believed to be in reference to racial segregation laws in the United States. When watching a film on Disney+ considered to have wrongful racist stereotypes, Disney added a disclaimer before the film starts to help avoid controversies.\nPlagiarism.\nDisney has also been accused a number of times of plagiarizing already existing works in its films. Most notably, \"The Lion King\" has many similarities in its characters and events to an animated series called \"Kimba the White Lion\" by animator Osamu Tezuka. ' also has many similarities to the anime show ' that were considered so prevalent the latter show's creator Gainax was planning to sue Disney but was stopped by its series' network NHK. Kelly Wilson, creator of the short \"The Snowman\" (2014), filed two lawsuits, one which came after the first was rescinded, against Disney for copyright infringement in Disney's animated film \"Frozen\". Disney later settled the lawsuit with Wilson, allowing the company to create a sequel to \"Frozen\". Screenwriter Gary L. Goldman sued Disney over its film \"Zootopia\", claiming he had earlier pitched an identical, same-titled story to the company. A judge dismissed the lawsuit, stating there was not enough evidence to prove any plagiarism. Disney itself is very protective about characters created by Walt Disney, and require every licensee to put the '\u00a9 Disney' mark on their products or packaging.\nLGBT+ representation.\nDisney has been criticized for both putting LGBT+ elements into its films and for having insufficient LGBT+ representation in its media. In the live-action film \"Beauty and the Beast\", director Bill Condon announced LeFou would be depicted as a gay character, prompting Kuwait, Malaysia, and a theater in Alabama to ban the film, and Russia to give it a stricter rating. In Russia and several Middle Eastern countries, the Pixar movie \"Onward\" was banned for having Disney's first openly lesbian character Officer Specter, while others said Disney needed more representation of LGBT+ persons in its media. Because of a scene featuring two lesbians kissing, Pixar's \"Lightyear\" was banned in 13 predominantly Muslim countries. In a leaked video of a Disney meeting, participants talked about pushing LGBT+ themes in the company's media, angering some people, who say the company is \"trying to sexualize children\", while others applauded its actions.\nSexism.\nSome Disney Princess films have been considered to be sexist toward women. Snow White is said to be too worried about her appearance while Cinderella is deemed to have no talents. Aurora is also said to be weak because she is always waiting to be rescued. In some of the princess films, men have more dialogue, and there are more speaking male characters than female. Disney's more-recent films are considered to be less sexist than its earlier films.\nWorking conditions.\nDisney has been accused of having poor working conditions. A protest by 2,000 workers at Disneyland in 2022 accused the company of poor pay at an average of $13 an hour, with some saying they were evicted from their homes. In 2010, at a factory in China where Disney products were being made, workers experienced working hours three times longer than those prescribed by law, and one of the workers died by suicide.\nAnimal cruelty.\nIn 1990, Disney paid $95,000 to avoid legal action over 16 animal-cruelty charges for beating vultures to death, shooting at birds, and starving some birds at Discovery Island. The company took these actions because the birds were attacking other animals and taking their food. When Animal Kingdom first opened, there were concerns about the animals because several of them died. Animal rights groups protested but the United States Department of Agriculture found no violations of animal-welfare regulations.\nFinancial data.\nRevenues.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nWorks cited.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Garros began a career in aviation in 1909 and performed many early feats such as the first-ever airplane crossing of the Mediterranean Sea in 1913. He joined the French army and became one of the earliest fighter pilots during World War I. Garros was shot down and died on 5 October 1918. In 1928, the Roland Garros tennis stadium was named in his memory; the French Open tennis tournament officially takes the name of Roland Garros, which is held in this stadium.\nBiography.\nRoland Garros was born in Saint-Denis, R\u00e9union, and studied at the Lyc\u00e9e Janson de Sailly and HEC Paris.\nAt the age of 12, he caught pneumonia, and was sent to Cannes to recover. He took up cycling to restore his health, and went on to win an inter-school championship in the sport. He was also keen on football, rugby and tennis. When he was 21 he started a car dealership in Paris. He was a close friend of Ettore Bugatti and in 1913 became the first owner of the Garros Bugatti Type 18, later named \"Black Bess\" by its second owner, British racing driver Ivy Cummings, which survives today at the Louwman Museum in the Netherlands.\nAviation.\nDuring Garros's summer holiday in 1909, at Sapicourt near Reims, staying with a friend's uncle, he saw the Grande Semaine d'Aviation de la Champagne which ran from 22 to 29 August. After this, he knew he had to be an aviator.\nHe started his aviation career in 1909 flying a Demoiselle (damselfly) monoplane, an aircraft that flew well only if it had a small lightweight pilot. He gained Ae.C.F. licence no. 147 in July 1910. In 1911 Garros graduated to flying Bl\u00e9riot XI monoplanes and entered a number of European air races with this type of aircraft, including the 1911 Paris to Madrid air race and the Circuit of Europe (Paris\u2013London\u2013Paris), in which he came second.\nOn 4 September 1911, he set an altitude record of . The following year, on 6 September 1912, after Austrian aviator Philipp von Blaschke had flown to , he regained the height record by flying to .\nBy 1913 he was flying the faster Morane-Saulnier monoplanes, and on 23 September gained fame for making the first non-stop flight across the Mediterranean Sea from Fr\u00e9jus-Saint Rapha\u00ebl in the south of France to Bizerte in Tunisia in a Morane-Saulnier G. The flight commenced at 5:47\u00a0am and lasted for nearly eight hours, during which time Garros resolved two engine malfunctions. The following year, Garros joined the French army at the outbreak of World War\u00a0I.\nMyth of first air battle.\nReports published in August 1914 claimed Garros was involved in the \"first air battle in world history\" and that he had flown his plane into a Zeppelin, destroying the airship and killing its pilots and himself. This story was quickly contradicted by reports that Garros was alive and well in Paris. Such early reports maintained that an unidentified French pilot had indeed rammed and destroyed a Zeppelin. However, German authorities denied the story. Later sources indicated the first aerial victory against a Zeppelin occurred in June 1915 and earlier reports, including that of Garros, were discounted.\nDevelopment of interrupter gear.\nIn the early stages of the air war in World War I, the problem of mounting a forward-firing machine gun on combat aircraft\u2014without having the bullets hit the propeller\u2014was considered by several people. As a reconnaissance pilot with the Escadrille MS26, Garros had made several attempts at shooting down German aircraft; however, these efforts were unsuccessful due to the difficulty in hitting an aircraft with a hand-held carbine. He visited the Morane-Saulnier works in November or December 1914 to discuss the problem.\nRaymond Saulnier had begun work on a synchroniser (which times the firing of the gun with the position of the propeller) before World War I and had taken out a patent for a workable mechanism by 14 April 1914. However, circumstances beyond his control resulted in its being tested with the Hotchkiss 09/13 portative machine gun, which proved unsuitable due to an inconsistent firing rate. As a workaround, Garros, with the help of his mechanic, Jules Hue, developed protective wedges, which were fitted to the slightly narrowed propeller blades which deflected the occasional round which would have otherwise struck the propeller. With a workable installation now fitted to his Morane-Saulnier G monoplane, Garros achieved the first ever shooting-down of an aircraft by a fighter firing through a tractor propeller, on 1 April 1915, and two more victories over German aircraft were achieved on 15 and 18 April 1915. The Aero Club of America awarded him a medal for this invention three years later.\nOn 18 April 1915, the fuel line of his Morane Saulnier Type G became clogged, causing engine trouble. He came down in German-controlled territory where he was grabbed by alert German infantrymen. The intact gun and propeller were quickly rushed to the Royal Dutch Aircraft Factory, founded by Dutch aviator Anthony Fokker, famous during World War I for its fighter aircraft. Fokker quickly dismissed the steel deflector plates and designed a practical interrupter gear for use on the Fokker E.I Monoplane. The interrupter gear began the \"Fokker Scourge\", and for a time Germany had the upper hand in the air war.\nPOW camp internment and escape.\nGarros was almost three years in captivity in various German POW camps, including in Kostrzyn nad Odr\u0105 and Mainz. He managed to escape on 14 February 1918 together with fellow aviator lieutenant Anselme Marchal. They made it to London via the Netherlands and from there he returned to France where he rejoined the French army. He returned to Escadrille 26 to pilot a SPAD S.XIII, and claimed two victories on 2 October 1918, one of which was confirmed.\nDeath.\nOn 5 October 1918, Garros was shot down and killed near Vouziers, Ardennes, a month before the end of the war and one day short of his 30th birthday. His adversary was probably German ace Hermann Habich from \"Jasta 49\", flying a Fokker D.VII.\nLegacy.\nGarros is sometimes called the world's first fighter ace; however, he shot down only four aircraft, while the criterion for \"ace\" was set at five or more victories. The honour of becoming the first ace went to another French airman, Adolphe P\u00e9goud, who had six victories early in the war.\nThe \"Stade Roland Garros\" tennis centre constructed in Paris in the 1920s was named after him. It accommodates the French Open, one of the four Grand Slam tennis tournaments. Consequently, the tournament is officially called \"Les Internationaux de France de Roland-Garros\" (the \"French Internationals of Roland Garros\").\nLa R\u00e9union's international airport is named the Roland Garros Airport. There is a monument to Garros in Bizerte at the site of his landing, which is called \"Roland Garros Plaza\". The town of Houlgate in Normandy has named their promenade after Roland Garros in celebration of the town's beach being the location where he broke the altitude record.\nAccording to V\u0169 Tr\u1ecdng Ph\u1ee5ng's urban novel, \"Dumb Luck\" (1936), during colonial times the Hanoi government named the city's main tennis stadium after Roland Garros.\nThe French car manufacturer Peugeot commissioned a 'Roland Garros' limited edition version of its 205 model in celebration of the tennis tournament that bears his name. The model included special paint and leather interior. Because of the success of this special edition, Peugeot later created Roland Garros editions of its 106, 108, 206, 207, 208, 306, 307, 308, 406, and 806 models.\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "37400", "revid": "50236370", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37400", "title": "Mole (unit)", "text": "SI unit of amount of substance\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Infobox/styles-images.css\" /&gt;\nThe mole (symbol mol) is a unit of measurement, the base unit in the International System of Units (SI) for \"amount of substance\", an SI base quantity proportional to the number of elementary entities of a substance. One mole is an aggregate of exactly elementary entities (approximately 602 sextillion or 602 billion times a trillion), which can be atoms, molecules, ions, ion pairs, or other particles. The number of particles in a mole is the Avogadro number (symbol \"N\"0) and the numerical value of the \"Avogadro constant\" (symbol \"N\"A) has units of mol\u22121. The relationship between the mole, Avogadro number, and Avogadro constant can be expressed in the following equation:formula_1The current SI value of the mole is based on the historical definition of the mole as the amount of substance that corresponds to the number of atoms in 12\u00a0grams of 12C, which made the molar mass of a compound in grams per mole, numerically equal to the average molecular mass or formula mass of the compound expressed in daltons. With the 2019 revision of the SI, the numerical equivalence is now only approximate, but may still be assumed with high accuracy. \nConceptually, the mole is similar to the concept of dozen or other convenient grouping used to discuss collections of identical objects. Because laboratory-scale objects contain a vast number of tiny atoms, the number of entities in the grouping must be huge to be useful for work.\nThe mole is widely used in chemistry as a convenient way to express amounts of reactants and amounts of products of chemical reactions. For example, the chemical equation 2 H2 + O2 \u2192 2 H2O can be interpreted to mean that for each 2\u00a0mol molecular hydrogen (H2) and 1\u00a0mol molecular oxygen (O2) that react, 2\u00a0mol of water (H2O) form. The concentration of a solution is commonly expressed by its molar concentration, defined as the amount of dissolved substance per unit volume of solution, for which the unit typically used is mole per litre (mol/L).\nConcepts.\nAs a set.\nConceptually a mole is similar to words like \"pair\" or \"dozen\". These words describe a set of identical objects\u2014i.e. a collection or aggregate of the objects themselves, not the numbers 2 or 12. The unusual and daunting aspect of a mole is that the number of objects in the set, given by the Avogadro number, is difficult to comprehend. To be useful as a unit, the mole needs to describe the amount in a sample containing a number of atoms (or other elementary entities) that can be manipulated in an ordinary chemistry lab. Atoms are so small that not just trillions but trillions-of-trillions of atoms are needed to create an aggregate large enough to work with.\nRelation to the Avogadro constant.\nThe number of entities (symbol \"N\") in a one-mole sample equals the Avogadro number (symbol \"N\"0), a dimensionless quantity. The \"Avogadro constant\" (symbol \"N\"A) is given by the Avogadro number multiplied by the unit reciprocal mole (mol\u22121), i.e. \"N\"A = \"N\"0/mol. The ratio \"n\" = \"N\"/\"N\"A is a measure of the amount of substance (with the unit mole).\nThe Avogadro constant was determined by a measurement of the number of 28Si atoms in a single crystalline sample.\nNature of the entities.\nDepending on the nature of the substance, an elementary entity may be an atom, a molecule, an ion, an ion pair, or a subatomic particle such as a proton. For example, 10\u00a0moles of water (a chemical compound) and 10\u00a0moles of mercury (a chemical element) contain equal numbers of particles of each substance, with one atom of mercury for each molecule of water, despite the two quantities having different volumes and different masses.\nThe mole is an amount corresponding to a given count (an Avogadro number) of elementary entities. Usually, the entities counted are chemically identical and individually distinct. For example, a solution may contain a certain number of dissolved molecules that are more or less independent of each other. However, the constituent entities in a solid are fixed and bound in a lattice arrangement, yet they may be separable without losing their chemical identity. Thus, the solid is composed of a certain number of moles of such entities. In yet other cases, such as diamond, where the entire crystal is essentially a single molecule, the mole is still used to express the number of atoms bound together, rather than a count of molecules. Thus, common chemical conventions apply to the definition of the constituent entities of a substance, in other cases exact definitions may be specified. The molar mass of a substance is equal to its relative atomic (or molecular) mass multiplied by the molar mass constant, which is almost exactly 1\u00a0g/mol.\nSimilar units.\nLike chemists, chemical engineers use the unit mole extensively, but different unit multiples may be more suitable for industrial use. For example, the SI unit for volume is the cubic metre, a much larger unit than the commonly used litre in the chemical laboratory. When amount of substance is also expressed in kmol (1000\u00a0mol) in industrial-scaled processes, the numerical value of molarity remains the same, as formula_2. Chemical engineers once used the \"kilogram-mole\" (notation \"kg-mol\"), which is defined as the number of entities in 12\u00a0kg of 12C, and often referred to the mole as the \"gram-mole\" (notation \"g-mol\"), then defined as the number of entities in 12\u00a0g of 12C, when dealing with laboratory data.\nLate 20th-century chemical engineering practice came to use the \"kilomole\" (kmol), which was numerically identical to the kilogram-mole (until the 2019 revision of the SI, which redefined the mole by fixing the value of the Avogadro constant, making it very nearly equivalent to but no longer exactly equal to the gram-mole), but whose name and symbol adopt the SI convention for standard multiples of metric units \u2013 thus, kmol means 1000\u00a0mol. This is equivalent to the use of kg instead of g. The use of kmol is not only for \"magnitude convenience\" but also makes the equations used for modelling chemical engineering systems coherent. For example, the conversion of a flowrate of kg/s to kmol/s only requires dividing by the molar mass in kg/kmol (which is equivalent to g/mol, as formula_3) without multiplying by 1000 unless the basic SI unit of mol/s were to be used, which would otherwise require the molar mass to be converted to kg/mol.\nFor convenience in avoiding conversions in the imperial (or US customary units), some engineers adopted the \"pound-mole\" (notation \"lb-mol\" or \"lbmol\"), which is defined as the number of entities in 12\u00a0lb of 12C. One lb-mol is equal to , which is the same numerical value as the number of grams in an international avoirdupois pound.\nGreenhouse and growth chamber lighting for plants is sometimes expressed in micromoles per square metre per second, where 1\u00a0mol photons \u2248 photons. The obsolete unit einstein is variously defined as the energy in one mole of photons and also as simply one mole of photons.\nDerived units and SI multiples.\nThe only SI derived unit with a special name derived from the mole is the katal, defined as one mole per second of catalytic activity. Like other SI units, the mole can also be modified by adding a metric prefix that multiplies it by a power of 10:\nOne femtomole is exactly molecules; attomole and smaller quantities do not correspond to a whole number of entities. The yoctomole, equal to around 0.6 of an individual molecule, did make appearances in scientific journals in the year the yocto- prefix was officially implemented.\nHistory.\nThe history of the mole is intertwined with that of units of molecular mass, and the Avogadro constant.\nThe first table of standard atomic weight was published by John Dalton (1766\u20131844) in 1805, based on a system in which the relative atomic mass of hydrogen was defined as 1. These relative atomic masses were based on the stoichiometric proportions of chemical reaction and compounds, a fact that greatly aided their acceptance: It was not necessary for a chemist to subscribe to atomic theory (an unproven hypothesis at the time) to make practical use of the tables. This would lead to some confusion between atomic masses (promoted by proponents of atomic theory) and equivalent weights (promoted by its opponents and which sometimes differed from relative atomic masses by an integer factor), which would last throughout much of the nineteenth century.\nJ\u00f6ns Jacob Berzelius (1779\u20131848) was instrumental in the determination of relative atomic masses to ever-increasing accuracy. He was also the first chemist to use oxygen as the standard to which other masses were referred. Oxygen is a useful standard, as, unlike hydrogen, it forms compounds with most other elements, especially metals. However, he chose to fix the atomic mass of oxygen as 100, which did not catch on.\nCharles Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Gerhardt (1816\u201356), Henri Victor Regnault (1810\u201378) and Stanislao Cannizzaro (1826\u20131910) expanded on Berzelius' works, resolving many of the problems of unknown stoichiometry of compounds, and the use of atomic masses attracted a large consensus by the time of the Karlsruhe Congress (1860). The convention had reverted to defining the atomic mass of hydrogen as 1, although at the level of precision of measurements at that time \u2013 relative uncertainties of around 1% \u2013 this was numerically equivalent to the later standard of oxygen = 16. However the chemical convenience of having oxygen as the primary atomic mass standard became ever more evident with advances in analytical chemistry and the need for ever more accurate atomic mass determinations.\nThe name \"mole\" is an 1897 translation of the German unit \"Mol\", coined by the chemist Wilhelm Ostwald in 1894 from the German word \"Molek\u00fcl\" (molecule). The related concept of equivalent mass had been in use at least a century earlier.\nIn chemistry, it has been known since Proust's law of definite proportions (1794) that knowledge of the mass of each of the components in a chemical system is not sufficient to define the system. Amount of substance can be described as mass divided by Proust's \"definite proportions\", and contains information that is missing from the measurement of mass alone. As demonstrated by Dalton's law of partial pressures (1803), a measurement of mass is not even necessary to measure the amount of substance (although in practice it is usual). There are many physical relationships between amount of substance and other physical quantities, the most notable one being the ideal gas law (where the relationship was first demonstrated in 1857). The term \"mole\" was first used in a textbook describing these colligative properties.\nStandardization.\nDevelopments in mass spectrometry led to the adoption of oxygen-16 as the standard substance, in lieu of natural oxygen.\nThe oxygen-16 definition was replaced with one based on carbon-12 during the 1960s. The International Bureau of Weights and Measures defined the mole as \"the amount of substance of a system which contains as many elementary entities as there are atoms in 0.012\u00a0kilograms of carbon-12.\" Thus, by that definition, one mole of pure 12C had a mass of \"exactly\" 12\u00a0g. The four different definitions were equivalent to within 1%.\nBecause a dalton, a unit commonly used to measure atomic mass, is exactly 1/12 of the mass of a carbon-12 atom, this definition of the mole entailed that the mass of one mole of a compound or element in grams was numerically equal to the average mass of one molecule or atom of the substance in daltons, and that the number of daltons in a gram was equal to the number of elementary entities in a mole. Because the mass of a nucleon (i.e. a proton or neutron) is approximately 1 dalton and the nucleons in an atom's nucleus make up the overwhelming majority of its mass, this definition also entailed that the mass of one mole of a substance was roughly equivalent to the number of nucleons in one atom or molecule of that substance.\nSince the definition of the gram was not mathematically tied to that of the dalton, the number of molecules per mole \"N\"A (the Avogadro constant) had to be determined experimentally. The experimental value adopted by CODATA in 2010 is \"N\"A =.\nIn 2011 the measurement was refined to .\nThe mole was made the seventh SI base unit in 1971 by the 14th CGPM.\n2019 revision of the SI.\nBefore the 2019 revision of the SI, the mole was defined as the amount of substance of a system that contains as many elementary entities as there are atoms in 12\u00a0grams of carbon-12 (the most common isotope of carbon).\nThe term \"gram-molecule\" was formerly used to mean one mole of molecules, and \"gram-atom\" for one mole of atoms. For example, 1\u00a0mole of MgBr2 is 1\u00a0gram-molecule of MgBr2 but 3\u00a0gram-atoms of MgBr2.\nIn 2011, the 24th meeting of the General Conference on Weights and Measures (CGPM) agreed to a plan for a possible revision of the SI base unit definitions at an undetermined date.\nOn 16 November 2018, after a meeting of scientists from more than 60 countries at the CGPM in Versailles, France, all SI base units were defined in terms of physical constants. This meant that each SI unit, including the mole, would not be defined in terms of any physical objects but rather they would be defined by physical constants that are, in their nature, exact.\nSuch changes officially came into effect on 20 May 2019. Following such changes, \"one mole\" of a substance was redefined as containing \"exactly elementary entities\" of that substance.\nCriticism.\nSince its adoption into the International System of Units in 1971, criticisms of the concept of the mole as a unit like the metre or the second have arisen:\nMole Day.\nOctober 23, denoted 10/23 in the US, is recognized by some as Mole Day. It is an informal holiday in honor of the unit among chemists. The date is derived from the Avogadro number, which is approximately . It starts at 6:02\u00a0a.m. and ends at 6:02\u00a0p.m. Alternatively, some chemists celebrate June\u00a02 (06/02), June\u00a022 (6/22), or 6\u00a0February (06.02), a reference to the 6.02 or 6.022 part of the constant.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Fertilizers may be distinct from liming materials or other non-nutrient soil amendments. Many sources of fertilizer exist, both natural and industrially produced. For most modern agricultural practices, fertilization focuses on three main macro nutrients: nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K) with occasional addition of supplements like rock flour for micronutrients. Farmers apply these fertilizers in a variety of ways: through dry or pelletized or liquid application processes, using large agricultural equipment, or hand-tool methods.\nHistorically, fertilization came from natural or organic sources: compost, animal manure, human manure, harvested minerals, crop rotations, and byproducts of human-nature industries (e.g. fish processing waste, or bloodmeal from animal slaughter). However, starting in the 19th century, after innovations in plant nutrition, an agricultural industry developed around synthetically created agrochemical fertilizers. This transition was important in transforming the global food system, allowing for larger-scale industrial agriculture with large crop yields.\nNitrogen-fixing chemical processes, such as the Haber process invented at the beginning of the 20th century, and amplified by production capacity created during World War II, led to a boom in using nitrogen fertilizers. In the latter half of the 20th century, increased use of nitrogen fertilizers (800% increase between 1961 and 2019) has been a crucial component of the increased productivity of conventional food systems (more than 30% per capita) as part of the so-called \"Green Revolution\".\nThe use of artificial and industrially applied fertilizers has caused environmental consequences such as water pollution and eutrophication due to nutritional runoff; carbon and other emissions from fertilizer production and mining; and contamination and pollution of soil. Various sustainable agriculture practices can be implemented to reduce the adverse environmental effects of fertilizer and pesticide use and environmental damage caused by industrial agriculture.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nHistory.\nManagement of soil fertility has preoccupied farmers since the beginning of agriculture. Middle Eastern, Chinese, Mesoamerican, and Cultures of the Central Andes were all early adopters of agriculture. This is thought to have led to their cultures growing faster in population which allowed an exportation of culture to neighboring hunter-gatherer groups. Fertilizer use along with agriculture allowed some of these early societies a critical advantage over their neighbors, leading them to become dominant cultures in their respective regions (P Bellwood - 2023). Egyptians, Romans, Babylonians, and early Germans are all recorded as using minerals or manure to enhance the productivity of their farms. The scientific research of plant nutrition started well before the work of German chemist Justus von Liebig although his name is most mentioned as the \"father of the fertilizer industry\". Nicolas Th\u00e9odore de Saussure and scientific colleagues at the time were quick to disprove the simplifications of von Liebig. Prominent scientists whom von Liebig drew were Carl Ludwig Sprenger and Hermann Hellriegel. In this field, a 'knowledge erosion' took place, partly driven by an intermingling of economics and research. John Bennet Lawes, an English entrepreneur, began experimenting on the effects of various manures on plants growing in pots in 1837, and a year or two later the experiments were extended to crops in the field. One immediate consequence was that in 1842 he patented a manure formed by treating phosphates with sulfuric acid, and thus was the first to create the artificial manure industry. In the succeeding year, he enlisted the services of Joseph Henry Gilbert; together they performed crop experiments at the Institute of Arable Crops Research.\nThe Birkeland\u2013Eyde process was one of the competing industrial processes at the beginning of nitrogen-based fertilizer production. This process was used to fix atmospheric nitrogen (N2) into nitric acid (HNO3), one of several chemical processes called nitrogen fixation. The resultant nitric acid was then used as a source of nitrate (NO3\u2212). A factory based on the process was built in Rjukan and Notodden in Norway and large hydroelectric power facilities were built.\nThe 1910s and 1920s witnessed the rise of the Haber process and the Ostwald process. The Haber process produces ammonia (NH3) from methane (CH4) (natural gas) and molecular nitrogen (N2) from the air. The ammonia from the Haber process is then partially converted into nitric acid (HNO3) in the Ostwald process. It is estimated that a third of annual global food production uses ammonia from the Haber\u2013Bosch process and that this supports nearly half the world's population. After World War II, nitrogen production plants that had ramped up for wartime bomb manufacturing were pivoted towards agricultural uses. The use of synthetic nitrogen fertilizers has increased steadily over the last 50 years, rising almost 20-fold to the current rate of 100 million tonnes of nitrogen per year.\nThe development of synthetic nitrogen fertilizers has significantly supported global population growth. It has been estimated that almost half the people on the Earth are currently fed due to synthetic nitrogen fertilizer use. The use of phosphate fertilizers has also increased from 9 million tonnes per year in 1960 to 40 million tonnes per year in 2000.\nAgricultural use of inorganic fertilizers in 2021 was 195 million tonnes of nutrients, of which 56% was nitrogen. Asia represented 53% of the world's total agricultural use of inorganic fertilizers in 2021, followed by the Americas (29%), Europe (12%), Africa (4%) and Oceania (2%). This ranking of the regions is the same for all nutrients. The main users of inorganic fertilizers are, in descending order, China, India, Brazil, and the United States of America (see Table 15), with China the largest user of each nutrient.\nA maize crop yielding 6\u20139 tonnes of grain per hectare () requires of phosphate fertilizer to be applied; soybean crops require about half, 20\u201325\u00a0kg per hectare. Yara International is the world's largest producer of nitrogen-based fertilizers.\nMechanism.\nFertilizers enhance the growth of plants. This goal is met in two ways, the traditional one being additives that provide nutrients. The second mode by which some fertilizers act is to enhance the effectiveness of the soil by modifying its water retention and aeration. This article, like many on fertilizers, emphasizes the nutritional aspect.\nFertilizers typically provide, in varying proportions:\nThe nutrients required for healthy plant life are classified according to the elements, but the elements are not used as fertilizers. Instead, compounds containing these elements are the basis of fertilizers. The macro-nutrients are consumed in larger quantities and are present in plant tissue in quantities from 0.15% to 6.0% on a dry matter (DM) (0% moisture) basis. Plants are made up of four main elements: hydrogen, oxygen, carbon, and nitrogen. Carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen are widely available respectively in carbon dioxide and in water. Although nitrogen makes up most of the atmosphere, it is in a form that is unavailable to plants. Nitrogen is the most important fertilizer since nitrogen is present in proteins (amide bonds between amino acids), DNA (puric and pyrimidic bases), and other components (e.g., tetrapyrrolic heme in chlorophyll). To be nutritious to plants, nitrogen must be made available in a \"fixed\" form. Only some bacteria and their host plants (notably legumes) can fix atmospheric nitrogen () by converting it to ammonia (). Phosphate () is required for the production of DNA (genetic code) and ATP, the main energy carrier in cells, as well as certain lipids (phospholipids, the main components of the lipidic double layer of the cell membranes).\nMicrobiological considerations.\nTwo sets of enzymatic reactions are highly relevant to the efficiency of nitrogen-based fertilizers. \nThe first is the hydrolysis (reaction with water) of urea (). Many soil bacteria possess the enzyme urease, which catalyzes the conversion of urea to ammonium ion () and bicarbonate ion ().\nAmmonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB), such as species of \"Nitrosomonas\", oxidize ammonia () to nitrite (), a process termed nitrification. Nitrite-oxidizing bacteria, especially \"Nitrobacter\", oxidize nitrite () to nitrate (), which is extremely soluble and mobile and is a major cause of eutrophication and algal bloom.\nClassification.\nFertilizers are classified in several ways. They are classified according to whether they provide a single nutrient (e.g., K, P, or N), in which case they are classified as \"straight fertilizers\". \"Multinutrient fertilizers\" (or \"complex fertilizers\") provide two or more nutrients, for example, N and P. Fertilizers are also sometimes classified as inorganic (the topic of most of this article) versus organic. Inorganic fertilizers exclude carbon-containing materials except ureas. Organic fertilizers are usually (recycled) plant- or animal-derived matter. Inorganic are sometimes called synthetic fertilizers since various chemical treatments are required for their manufacture.\nSingle nutrient (\"straight\") fertilizers.\nThe main nitrogen-based straight fertilizer is ammonia (NH3) ammonium (NH4+) or its solutions, including:\nThe main straight phosphate fertilizers are the superphosphates:\nA mixture of single superphosphate and triple superphosphate is called double superphosphate. More than 90% of a typical superphosphate fertilizer is water-soluble.\nThe main potassium-based straight fertilizer is muriate of potash (MOP, 95\u201399% KCl). It is typically available as 0-0-60 or 0-0-62 fertilizer.\nMultinutrient fertilizers.\nThese fertilizers are common. They consist of two or more nutrient components.\nMajor two-component fertilizers provide both nitrogen and phosphorus to the plants. These are called NP fertilizers. The main NP fertilizers are \nAbout 85% of MAP and DAP fertilizers are soluble in water.\nNPK fertilizers are three-component fertilizers providing nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. There exist two types of NPK fertilizers: compound and blends. Compound NPK fertilizers contain chemically bound ingredients, while blended NPK fertilizers are physical mixtures of single nutrient components.\nNPK rating is a rating system describing the amount of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium in a fertilizer. NPK ratings consist of three numbers separated by dashes (e.g., 10-10-10 or 16-4-8) describing the chemical content of fertilizers. The first number represents the percentage of nitrogen in the product; the second number, P2O5; the third, K2O. Fertilizers do not actually contain P2O5 or K2O, but the system is a conventional shorthand for the amount of the phosphorus (P) or potassium (K) in a fertilizer. A bag of fertilizer labeled 16-4-8 contains of nitrogen (16% of the 50 pounds), an amount of phosphorus equivalent to that in 2 pounds of P2O5 (4% of 50 pounds), and 4 pounds of K2O (8% of 50 pounds). Most fertilizers are labeled according to this N-P-K convention, although Australian convention, following an N-P-K-S system, adds a fourth number for sulfur, and uses elemental values for all values including P and K.\nMicronutrients.\nMicronutrients are consumed in smaller quantities and are present in plant tissue on the order of parts-per-million (ppm), ranging from 0.15 to 400 ppm or less than 0.04% dry matter. These elements are often required for enzymes essential to the plant's metabolism. Because these elements enable catalysts (enzymes), their impact far exceeds their weight%age. Typical micronutrients are boron, zinc, molybdenum, iron, and manganese. These elements are provided as water-soluble salts. Iron presents special problems because it converts to insoluble (bio-unavailable) compounds at moderate soil pH and phosphate concentrations. For this reason, iron is often administered as a chelate complex, e.g., the EDTA or EDDHA derivatives. The micronutrient needs depend on the plant and the environment. For example, sugar beets appear to require boron, and legumes require cobalt, while environmental conditions such as heat or drought make boron less available for plants.\nProduction.\nThe production of synthetic, or inorganic, fertilizers require prepared chemicals, whereas organic fertilizers are derived from the organic processes of plants and animals in biological processes using biochemicals.\nNitrogen fertilizers.\nNitrogen fertilizers are made from ammonia (NH3) produced by the Haber\u2013Bosch process. In this energy-intensive process, natural gas (CH4) usually supplies the hydrogen, and the nitrogen (N2) is derived from the air. This ammonia is used as a feedstock for all other nitrogen fertilizers, such as anhydrous ammonium nitrate (NH4NO3) and urea (CO(NH2)2).\nDeposits of sodium nitrate (NaNO3) (Chilean saltpeter) are also found in the Atacama Desert in Chile and was one of the original (1830) nitrogen-rich fertilizers used. It is still mined for fertilizer. Nitrates are also produced from ammonia by the Ostwald process.\nPhosphate fertilizers.\nPhosphate fertilizers are obtained by extraction from phosphate rock, which contains two principal phosphorus-containing minerals, fluorapatite Ca5(PO4)3F (CFA) and hydroxyapatite Ca5(PO4)3OH. Billions of kg of phosphate rock are mined annually, but the size and quality of the remaining ore is decreasing. These minerals are converted into water-soluble phosphate salts by treatment with acids. The large production of sulfuric acid is primarily motivated by this application. In the nitrophosphate process or Odda process (invented in 1927), phosphate rock with up to a 20% phosphorus (P) content is dissolved with nitric acid (HNO3) to produce a mixture of phosphoric acid (H3PO4) and calcium nitrate (Ca(NO3)2). This mixture can be combined with a potassium fertilizer to produce a \"compound fertilizer\" with the three macronutrients N, P and K in easily dissolved form.\nPotassium fertilizers.\nPotash is a mixture of potassium minerals used to make potassium (chemical symbol: K) fertilizers. Potash is soluble in water, so the main effort in producing this nutrient from the ore involves some purification steps, e.g., to remove sodium chloride (NaCl) (common salt). Sometimes potash is referred to as K2O, as a matter of convenience to those describing the potassium content. In fact, potash fertilizers are usually potassium chloride, potassium sulfate, potassium carbonate, or potassium nitrate.\nNPK fertilizers.\nThere are three major routes for manufacturing NPK fertilizers (named for their main ingredients: nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K)):\nStep 2. Removal of Calcium Nitrate. It is important to remove the calcium nitrate because calcium nitrate is extremely hygroscopic. \nOrganic fertilizers.\n\"Organic fertilizers\" can describe those fertilizers with a biologic origin\u2014derived from living or formerly living materials. Organic fertilizers can also describe commercially available and frequently packaged products that strive to follow the expectations and restrictions adopted by \"organic agriculture\" and \"environmentally friendly\" gardening \u2013 related systems of food and plant production that significantly limit or strictly avoid the use of synthetic fertilizers and pesticides. The \"organic fertilizer\" \"products\" typically contain both some organic materials as well as acceptable additives such as nutritive rock powders, ground seashells (crab, oyster, etc.), other prepared products such as seed meal or kelp, and cultivated microorganisms and derivatives.\nFertilizers of an organic origin (the first definition) include animal wastes, plant wastes from agriculture, seaweed, compost, and treated sewage sludge (biosolids). Beyond manures, animal sources can include products from the slaughter of animals \u2013 bloodmeal, bone meal, feather meal, hides, hoofs, and horns all are typical components. Organically derived materials available to industry such as sewage sludge may not be acceptable components of organic farming and gardening, because of factors ranging from residual contaminants to public perception. On the other hand, marketed \"organic fertilizers\" may include, and promote, processed organics \"because\" the materials have consumer appeal. No matter the definition nor composition, most of these products contain less-concentrated nutrients, and the nutrients are not as easily quantified. They can offer soil-building advantages as well as be appealing to those who are trying to farm / garden more \"naturally\".\nIn terms of volume, peat is the most widely used packaged organic soil amendment. It is an immature form of coal and improves the soil by aeration and absorbing water but confers no nutritional value to the plants. It is therefore not a fertilizer as defined in the beginning of the article, but rather an amendment. Coir, (derived from coconut husks), bark, and sawdust when added to soil all act similarly (but not identically) to peat and are also considered organic soil amendments \u2013 or texturizers \u2013 because of their limited nutritive inputs. Some organic additives can have a reverse effect on nutrients \u2013 fresh sawdust can consume soil nutrients as it breaks down and may lower soil pH \u2013 but these same organic texturizers (as well as compost, etc.) may increase the availability of nutrients through improved cation exchange, or through increased growth of microorganisms that in turn increase availability of certain plant nutrients. Organic fertilizers such as composts and manures may be distributed locally without going into industry production, making actual consumption more difficult to quantify.\nFertilizer consumption.\nChina has become the largest producer and consumer of nitrogen fertilizers while Africa has little reliance on nitrogen fertilizers. Agricultural and chemical minerals are very important in industrial use of fertilizers, which is valued at approximately $200 billion. Nitrogen has a significant impact in the global mineral use, followed by potash and phosphate. The production of nitrogen has drastically increased since the 1960s. Phosphate and potash have increased in price since the 1960s, which is larger than the consumer price index. Potash is produced in Canada, Russia and Belarus, together making up over half of the world production. Potash production in Canada rose in 2017 and 2018 by 18.6%. Conservative estimates report 30 to 50% of crop yields are attributed to natural or synthetic commercial fertilizers. Fertilizer consumption has surpassed the amount of farmland in the United States.\nData on the fertilizer consumption per hectare arable land in 2012 are published by The World Bank. The diagram below shows fertilizer consumption by the European Union (EU) countries as kilograms per hectare (pounds per acre). The total consumption of fertilizer in the EU is 15.9 million tons for 105 million hectare arable land area (or 107 million hectare arable land according to another estimate). This figure equates to 151\u00a0kg of fertilizers consumed per ha arable land on average by the EU countries.\nApplication.\nFertilizers are commonly used for growing all crops, with application rates depending on the soil fertility, usually as measured by a soil test and according to the particular crop. Legumes, for example, fix nitrogen from the atmosphere and generally do not require nitrogen fertilizer.\nLiquid vs solid.\nFertilizers are applied to crops both as solids and as liquid. About 90% of fertilizers are applied as solids. The most widely used solid inorganic fertilizers are urea, diammonium phosphate and potassium chloride. Solid fertilizer is typically granulated or powdered. Often solids are available as prills, a solid globule. Liquid fertilizers comprise anhydrous ammonia, aqueous solutions of ammonia, aqueous solutions of ammonium nitrate or urea. These concentrated products may be diluted with water to form a concentrated liquid fertilizer (e.g., UAN). Advantages of liquid fertilizer are its more rapid effect and easier coverage. The addition of fertilizer to irrigation water is called \"fertigation\". Granulated fertilizers are more economical to ship and store, not to mention easier to apply.\nUrea.\nUrea is highly soluble in water and is therefore also very suitable for use in fertilizer solutions (in combination with ammonium nitrate: UAN), e.g., in 'foliar feed' fertilizers. For fertilizer use, granules are preferred over prills because of their narrower particle size distribution, which is an advantage for mechanical application.\nUrea is usually spread at rates of between 40 and 300\u00a0kg/ha (35 to 270\u00a0lbs/acre) but rates vary. Smaller applications incur lower losses due to leaching. During summer, urea is often spread just before or during rain to minimize losses from volatilization (a process wherein nitrogen is lost to the atmosphere as ammonia gas).\nBecause of the high nitrogen concentration in urea, it is very important to achieve an even spread. Drilling must not occur on contact with or close to seed, due to the risk of germination damage. Urea dissolves in water for application as a spray or through irrigation systems.\nIn grain and cotton crops, urea is often applied at the time of the last cultivation before planting. In high rainfall areas and on sandy soils (where nitrogen can be lost through leaching) and where good in-season rainfall is expected, urea can be side- or top-dressed during the growing season. Top-dressing is also popular on pasture and forage crops. In cultivating sugarcane, urea is side dressed after planting and applied to each ratoon crop.\nBecause it absorbs moisture from the atmosphere, urea is often stored in closed containers.\nOverdose or placing urea near seed is harmful.\nFoliar application.\nFoliar fertilizers are applied directly to leaves. This method is almost invariably used to apply water-soluble straight nitrogen fertilizers and used especially for high-value crops such as fruits. Urea is the most common foliar fertilizer.\nChemicals that affect nitrogen uptake.\nVarious chemicals are used to enhance the efficiency of nitrogen-based fertilizers. In this way farmers can limit the polluting effects of nitrogen run-off. Nitrification inhibitors (also known as nitrogen stabilizers) suppress the conversion of ammonia into nitrate, an anion that is more prone to leaching. 1-Carbamoyl-3-methylpyrazole (CMP), dicyandiamide, nitrapyrin (2-chloro-6-trichloromethylpyridine) and 3,4-dimethylpyrazole phosphate (DMPP) are popular. Urease inhibitors are used to slow the hydrolytic conversion of urea into ammonia, which is prone to evaporation as well as nitrification. The conversion of urea to ammonia catalyzed by enzymes called ureases. A popular inhibitor of ureases is \"N\"-(\"n\"-butyl)thiophosphoric triamide (NBPT).\nOverfertilization.\nCareful use of fertilization technologies is important because excess nutrients can be detrimental. Fertilizer burn can occur when too much fertilizer is applied, resulting in damage or even death of the plant. Fertilizers vary in their tendency to burn roughly in accordance with their salt index.\nEnvironmental effects.\nSynthetic fertilizer used in agriculture has wide-reaching environmental consequences.\nAccording to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Special Report on Climate Change and Land, production of these fertilizers and associated land use practices are drivers of global warming. The use of fertilizer has also led to a number of direct environmental consequences: agricultural runoff which leads to downstream effects like ocean dead zones and waterway contamination, soil microbiome degradation, and accumulation of toxins in ecosystems. Indirect environmental impacts include: the environmental impacts of fracking for natural gas used in the Haber process, the agricultural boom is partially responsible for the rapid growth in human population and large-scale industrial agricultural practices are associated with habitat destruction, pressure on biodiversity and agricultural soil loss.\nIn order to mitigate environmental and food security concerns, the international community has included food systems in Sustainable Development Goal 2 which focuses on creating a climate-friendly and sustainable food production system. Most policy and regulatory approaches to address these issues focus on pivoting agricultural practices towards sustainable or regenerative agricultural practices: these use less synthetic fertilizers, better soil management (for example no-till agriculture) and more organic fertilizers.\nFor each ton of phosphoric acid produced by the processing of phosphate rock, five tons of waste are generated. This waste takes the form of impure, useless, radioactive solid called phosphogypsum. Estimates range from 100,000,000 and 280,000,000 tons of phosphogypsum waste produced annually worldwide.\nWater.\nPhosphorus and nitrogen fertilizers can affect soil, surface water, and groundwater due to the dispersion of minerals into waterways due to high rainfall, snowmelt and can leaching into groundwater over time. Agricultural run-off is a major contributor to the eutrophication of freshwater bodies. For example, in the US, about half of all the lakes are eutrophic. The main contributor to eutrophication is phosphate, which is normally a limiting nutrient; high concentrations promote the growth of cyanobacteria and algae, the demise of which consumes oxygen. Cyanobacteria blooms ('algal blooms') can also produce harmful toxins that can accumulate in the food chain, and can be harmful to humans. Fertilizer run-off can be reduced by using weather-optimized fertilization strategies.\nThe nitrogen-rich compounds found in fertilizer runoff are the primary cause of serious oxygen depletion in many parts of oceans, especially in coastal zones, lakes and rivers. The resulting lack of dissolved oxygen greatly reduces the ability of these areas to sustain oceanic fauna. The number of oceanic dead zones near inhabited coastlines is increasing.\nAs of 2006, the application of nitrogen fertilizer is being increasingly controlled in northwestern Europe and the United States. In cases where eutrophication can be reversed, it may nevertheless take decades and significant soil management before the accumulated nitrates in groundwater can be broken down by natural processes.\nNitrate pollution.\nOnly a fraction of the nitrogen-based fertilizers is converted to plant matter. The remainder accumulates in the soil or is lost as run-off. High application rates of nitrogen-containing fertilizers combined with the high water solubility of nitrate leads to increased runoff into surface water as well as leaching into groundwater, thereby causing groundwater pollution. The excessive use of nitrogen-containing fertilizers (be they synthetic or natural) is particularly damaging, as much of the nitrogen that is not taken up by plants is transformed into nitrate which is easily leached.\nNitrate levels above 10\u00a0mg/L (10 ppm) in groundwater can cause 'blue baby syndrome' (acquired methemoglobinemia). The nutrients, especially nitrates, in fertilizers can cause problems for natural habitats and for human health if they are washed off soil into watercourses or leached through soil into groundwater. Run-off can lead to fertilizing blooms of algae that use up all the oxygen and leave huge \"dead zones\" behind where other fish and aquatic life can not live.\nSoil.\nAcidification.\nSoil acidification refers to the process by which the pH level of soil becomes more acidic over time. Soil pH is a measure of the soil's acidity or alkalinity and is determined on a scale from 0 to 14, with 7 being neutral. A pH value below 7 indicates acidic soil, while a pH value above 7 indicates alkaline or basic soil.\nSoil acidification is a significant concern in agriculture and horticulture. It refers to the process of the soil becoming more acidic over time. \nNitrogen-containing fertilizers can cause soil acidification when added. This may lead to decrease in nutrient availability which may be offset by liming. These fertilizers release ammonium or nitrate ions, which can acidify the soil as they undergo chemical reactions.\nWhen these nitrogen-containing fertilizers are added to the soil, they increase the concentration of hydrogen ions (H+) in the soil solution, which lowers the pH of the soil.\nAccumulation of toxic elements.\nCadmium.\nThe concentration of cadmium in phosphorus-containing fertilizers varies considerably and can be problematic. For example, mono-ammonium phosphate fertilizer may have a cadmium content of as low as 0.14\u00a0mg/kg or as high as 50.9\u00a0mg/kg. The phosphate rock used in their manufacture can contain as much as 188\u00a0mg/kg cadmium (examples are deposits on Nauru and the Christmas Islands). Continuous use of high-cadmium fertilizer can contaminate soil (as shown in New Zealand) and plants. Limits to the cadmium content of phosphate fertilizers has been considered by the European Commission. Producers of phosphorus-containing fertilizers now select phosphate rock based on the cadmium content.\nFluoride.\nPhosphate rocks contain high levels of fluoride. Consequently, the widespread use of phosphate fertilizers has increased soil fluoride concentrations. It has been found that food contamination from fertilizer is of little concern as plants accumulate little fluoride from the soil; of greater concern is the possibility of fluoride toxicity to livestock that ingest contaminated soils. Also of possible concern are the effects of fluoride on soil microorganisms.\nRadioactive elements.\nThe radioactive content of the fertilizers varies considerably and depends both on their concentrations in the parent mineral and on the fertilizer production process. Uranium-238 concentrations can range from 7 to 100 pCi/g (picocuries per gram) in phosphate rock and from 1 to 67 pCi/g in phosphate fertilizers. Where high annual rates of phosphorus fertilizer are used, this can result in uranium-238 concentrations in soils and drainage waters that are several times greater than are normally present. However, the impact of these increases on the risk to human health from radinuclide contamination of foods is very small (less than 0.05 mSv/y).\nOther metals.\nSteel industry wastes, recycled into fertilizers for their high levels of zinc (essential to plant growth), wastes can include the following toxic metals: lead arsenic, cadmium, chromium, and nickel. The most common toxic elements in this type of fertilizer are mercury, lead, and arsenic. These potentially harmful impurities can be removed; however, this significantly increases cost. Highly pure fertilizers are widely available and perhaps best known as the highly water-soluble fertilizers containing blue dyes used around households, such as Miracle-Gro. These highly water-soluble fertilizers are used in the plant nursery business and are available in larger packages at significantly less cost than retail quantities. Some inexpensive retail granular garden fertilizers are made with high purity ingredients.\nTrace mineral depletion.\nAttention has been addressed to the decreasing concentrations of elements such as iron, zinc, copper and magnesium in many foods over the last 50\u201360 years. Intensive farming practices, including the use of synthetic fertilizers are frequently suggested as reasons for these declines and organic farming is often suggested as a solution. Although improved crop yields resulting from NPK fertilizers are known to dilute the concentrations of other nutrients in plants, much of the measured decline can be attributed to the use of progressively higher-yielding crop varieties that produce foods with lower mineral concentrations than their less-productive ancestors. It is, therefore, unlikely that organic farming or reduced use of fertilizers will solve the problem; foods with high nutrient density are posited to be achieved using older, lower-yielding varieties or the development of new high-yield, nutrient-dense varieties.\nFertilizers are, in fact, more likely to solve trace mineral deficiency problems than cause them: In Western Australia deficiencies of zinc, copper, manganese, iron and molybdenum were identified as limiting the growth of broad-acre crops and pastures in the 1940s and 1950s. Soils in Western Australia are very old, highly weathered and deficient in many of the major nutrients and trace elements. Since this time these trace elements are routinely added to fertilizers used in agriculture in this state. Many other soils around the world are deficient in zinc, leading to deficiency in both plants and humans, and zinc fertilizers are widely used to solve this problem.\nChanges in soil biology.\nHigh levels of fertilizer may cause the breakdown of the symbiotic relationships between plant roots and mycorrhizal fungi.\nOrganic agriculture.\nTwo types of agricultural management practices include organic agriculture and conventional agriculture. The former encourages soil fertility using local resources to maximize efficiency. Organic agriculture avoids synthetic agrochemicals. Conventional agriculture uses all the components that organic agriculture does not use.\nHydrogen consumption and sustainability.\nMost fertilizer is made from dirty hydrogen. Ammonia is produced from natural gas and air. The cost of natural gas makes up about 90% of the cost of producing ammonia. The increase in price of natural gases over the past decade, along with other factors such as increasing demand, have contributed to an increase in fertilizer price.\nContribution to climate change.\nThe amount of greenhouse gases carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide produced during the manufacture and use of nitrogen fertilizer is estimated as around 5% of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions. One third is produced during the production and two thirds during the use of fertilizers. Nitrogen fertilizer can be converted by soil bacteria to nitrous oxide, a greenhouse gas. Nitrous oxide emissions by humans, most of which are from fertilizer, between 2007 and 2016 have been estimated at 7 million tonnes per year, which is incompatible with limiting global warming to below 2\u00a0\u00b0C.\nAtmosphere.\nThrough the increasing use of nitrogen fertilizer, which was used at a rate of about 110 million tons (of N) per year in 2012, adding to the already existing amount of reactive nitrogen, nitrous oxide (N2O) has become the third most important greenhouse gas after carbon dioxide and methane. It has a global warming potential 296 times larger than an equal mass of carbon dioxide and it also contributes to stratospheric ozone depletion.\nBy changing processes and procedures, it is possible to mitigate some, but not all, of these effects on anthropogenic climate change.\nMethane emissions from crop fields (notably rice paddy fields) are increased by the application of ammonium-based fertilizers. These emissions contribute to global climate change as methane is a potent greenhouse gas.\nPolicy.\nRegulation.\nIn Europe, problems with high nitrate concentrations in runoff are being addressed by the European Union's Nitrates Directive. Within Britain, farmers are encouraged to manage their land more sustainably in 'catchment-sensitive farming'. In the US, high concentrations of nitrate and phosphorus in runoff and drainage water are classified as nonpoint source pollutants due to their diffuse origin; this pollution is regulated at the state level. Oregon and Washington, both in the United States, have fertilizer registration programs with on-line databases listing chemical analyses of fertilizers. Carbon emission trading and eco-tariffs affect the production and price of fertilizer.\nSubsidies.\nIn China, regulations have been implemented to control the use of N fertilizers in farming. In 2008, Chinese governments began to partially withdraw fertilizer subsidies, including subsidies to fertilizer transportation and to electricity and natural gas use in the industry. In consequence, the price of fertilizer has gone up and large-scale farms have begun to use less fertilizer. If large-scale farms keep reducing their use of fertilizer subsidies, they have no choice but to optimize the fertilizer they have which would therefore gain an increase in both grain yield and profit.\nIn March 2022, the United States Department of Agriculture announced a new $250M grant to promote American fertilizer production. Part of the Commodity Credit Corporation, the grant program will support fertilizer production that is independent of dominant fertilizer suppliers, made in America, and utilizing innovative production techniques to jumpstart future competition.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It was first domesticated around 8,000 years ago and is one of the most common and widespread domesticated animals in the world. Chickens are primarily kept for their meat and eggs, though they are also kept as pets.\nAs of 2023, the global chicken population exceeds 26.5 billion, with more than 50 billion birds produced annually for consumption. Specialized breeds such as broilers and laying hens have been developed for meat and egg production, respectively. A hen bred for laying can produce over 300 eggs per year. Chickens are social animals with complex vocalizations and behaviors, and feature in folklore, religion, and literature across many societies. Their economic importance makes them a central component of global animal husbandry.\nNomenclature.\nTerms for chickens include:\n\"Chicken\" can mean a \"chick\", and this was historically the meaning of the word chicken, as in William Shakespeare's play \"Macbeth\", where Macduff laments the death of \"all my pretty chickens and their dam\". The usage is preserved in placenames such as the Hen and Chicken Islands. In older sources, and still often in trade and scientific contexts, chickens as a species are described as \"common fowl\" or \"domestic fowl\".\nDescription.\nChickens are relatively large birds, active by day. The body is round, the legs are unfeathered in most breeds, and the wings are short. Wild junglefowl can fly, whereas domestic chickens and their flight muscles are too heavy to allow them to fly more than a short distance. Size and coloration vary widely between breeds. Newly hatched chicks of both modern and heritage varieties weigh the same, about . Modern varieties however grow much faster; by day 35 a Ross 708 broiler may weigh as against the of a heritage chicken of the same age.\nAdult chickens of both sexes have a fleshy crest on their heads called a comb or cockscomb, and hanging flaps of skin on either side under their beaks called wattles; combs and wattles are more prominent in males. Some breeds have a mutation that causes extra feathering under the face, giving the appearance of a beard.\nChickens are omnivores. In the wild, they scratch at the soil to search for seeds, insects, and animals as large as lizards, small snakes, and young mice. A chicken may live for 5\u201310 years, depending on the breed. The world's oldest known chicken lived for 16 years.\nChickens are gregarious, living in flocks, and incubate eggs and raise young communally. Individual chickens dominate others, establishing a pecking order; dominant individuals take priority for access to food and nest sites. The concept of dominance, involving pecking, was described in female chickens by Thorleif Schjelderup-Ebbe in 1921 as the \"pecking order\". Male chickens tend to leap and use their claws in conflicts. Chickens are capable of mobbing and killing a weak or inexperienced predator, such as a young fox. Chickens have been thought of primarily as providers of food, but their cognition, emotions, and sociality are comparable with other birds and mammals.\nA male's crowing is a loud and sometimes shrill call, serving as a territorial signal to other males, and in response to sudden disturbances within their surroundings. Hens cluck loudly after laying an egg and to call their chicks. Chickens give different warning calls to indicate that a predator is approaching from the air or on the ground.\nReproduction and life-cycle.\nTo initiate courting, some roosters may dance in a circle around or near a hen (a circle dance), often lowering the wing which is closest to the hen. The dance triggers a response in the hen and when she responds to his call, the rooster may mount the hen and proceed with the mating. Mating typically involves a sequence in which the male approaches the female and performs a waltzing display. If the female is unreceptive, she runs off; otherwise, she crouches, and the male mounts, treading with both feet on her back. After copulation the male does a tail-bending display.\nSperm transfer occurs by cloacal contact between the male and female, in an action called the 'cloacal kiss'. As with all birds, reproduction is controlled by a neuroendocrine system, the Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone-I neurons in the hypothalamus. Reproductive hormones including estrogen, progesterone, and gonadotropins (luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone) initiate and maintain sexual maturation changes. Reproduction declines with age, thought to be due to a decline in GnRH-I-N.\nHens often try to lay in nests that already contain eggs and sometimes move eggs from neighbouring nests into their own. A flock thus uses only a few preferred locations, rather than having a different nest for every bird. Under natural conditions, most birds lay only until a clutch is complete; they then incubate all the eggs. This is called \"going broody\". The hen sits on the nest, fluffing up or pecking defensively if disturbed. She rarely leaves the nest until the eggs have hatched.\nEggs of chickens from the high-altitude region of Tibet have special physiological adaptations that result in a higher hatching rate in low oxygen environments. When eggs are placed in a hypoxic environment, chicken embryos from these populations express much more hemoglobin than embryos from other chicken populations. This hemoglobin has a greater affinity for oxygen, binding oxygen more readily.\nFertile chicken eggs hatch at the end of the incubation period, about 21 days; the chick uses its egg tooth to break out of the shell. Hens remain on the nest for about two days after the first chick hatches; during this time the newly hatched chicks feed by absorbing the internal yolk sac. The hen guards her chicks and broods them to keep them warm. She leads them to food and water and calls them towards food. The chicks imprint on the hen and subsequently follow her continually. She continues to care for them until they are several weeks old.\nInbreeding of White Leghorn chickens tends to cause inbreeding depression expressed as reduced egg number and delayed sexual maturity. Strongly inbred Langshan chickens display obvious inbreeding depression in reproduction, particularly for traits such as age when the first egg is laid and egg number.\nOrigin.\nPhylogeny.\nWater or ground-dwelling fowl similar to modern partridges, in the Galliformes, the order of bird that chickens belong to, survived the Cretaceous\u2013Paleogene extinction event that killed all tree-dwelling birds and their dinosaur relatives. Chickens are descended primarily from the red junglefowl (\"Gallus gallus\") and are scientifically classified as the same species. Domesticated chickens freely interbreed with populations of red junglefowl. The domestic chicken has subsequently hybridised with grey junglefowl, Sri Lankan junglefowl and green junglefowl; a gene for yellow skin, for instance, was incorporated into domestic birds from the grey junglefowl (\"G. sonneratii\"). It is estimated that chickens share between 71 and 79% of their genome with red junglefowl.\nDomestication.\nAccording to one early study, a single domestication event of the red junglefowl in present-day Thailand gave rise to the modern chicken with minor transitions separating the modern breeds. The red junglefowl is well adapted to take advantage of the vast quantities of seed produced during the end of the multi-decade bamboo seeding cycle, to boost its own reproduction. In domesticating the chicken, humans took advantage of the red junglefowl's ability to reproduce prolifically when exposed to a surge in its food supply.\nExactly when and where the chicken was domesticated was controversial. Genomic studies estimated that the chicken was domesticated 8,000 years ago in Southeast Asia and spread to China and India 2,000 to 3,000 years later. Archaeological evidence appeared to support domestic chickens in Southeast Asia well before 6000 BC, China by 6000 BC and India by 2000 BC. A landmark 2020 \"Nature\" study that fully sequenced 863 chickens across the world suggests that all domestic chickens originate from a single domestication event of red junglefowl (\"Gallus gallus\") whose present-day distribution is predominantly in southeast Asia. These domesticated chickens spread across Southeast and South Asia where they interbred with local wild species of junglefowl, forming genetically and geographically distinct groups. Analysis of the most popular commercial breed shows that the White Leghorn breed possesses a mosaic of divergent ancestries inherited from subspecies of red junglefowl.\nRe-examination of bones from over 600 sites, and dating of those from 23 sites, identified the earliest probable chicken bones as from central Thailand, at Ban Non Wat, some 3,250 years ago. The paleo-anatomist Joris Peters and the bioarchaeologist Greger Larson state that this coincided with the growing of rice, and propose that wild jungle fowl were attracted to eat the rice seeds, nested nearby, and became domesticated. Skeletons of birds in the \"Gallus\" genus were used as grave goods at the site, confirming domestication.\nDispersal.\nAustronesia.\nA word for the domestic chicken (\"*manuk\") is part of the reconstructed Proto-Austronesian language, indicating they were domesticated by the Austronesian peoples since ancient times. Chickens, together with dogs and pigs, were carried throughout the entire range of the prehistoric Austronesian maritime migrations to Island Southeast Asia, Micronesia, Island Melanesia, Polynesia, and Madagascar, starting from at least 3000\u00a0BC from Taiwan. These chickens may have been introduced during pre-Columbian times to South America via Polynesian seafarers, but this is disputed.\nAfrica.\nChickens reached Egypt via the Middle East for purposes of cockfighting about 1400\u00a0BC and became widely bred in Egypt around 300\u00a0BC. Three possible routes of introduction into Africa around the early first millennium AD could have been through the Egyptian Nile Valley, the East Africa Roman-Greek or Indian trade, or from Carthage and the Berbers, across the Sahara. The earliest known remains are from Mali, Nubia, East Coast, and South Africa and date back to the middle of the first millennium AD.\nAmericas.\nThe possibility that domestic chickens were in the Americas before Western contact is debated by researchers, but blue-egged chickens, found only in the Americas and Asia, suggest an Asian origin for early American chickens. A lack of data from Thailand, Russia, the Indian subcontinent, Southeast Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa makes it difficult to lay out a clear map of the spread of chickens in these areas; better description and genetic analysis of local breeds threatened by extinction may also help with research into this area. Chicken bones from the Arauco Peninsula in south-central Chile were radiocarbon dated as pre-Columbian, and DNA analysis suggested they were related to prehistoric populations in Polynesia. However, further study of the same bones cast doubt on the findings.\nEurasia.\nChicken remains have been difficult to date, given the small and fragile bird bones; this may account for discrepancies in dates given by different sources. Archaeological evidence is supplemented by mentions in historical texts from the last few centuries BC, and by depictions in prehistoric artworks, such as across Central Asia. Chickens were widespread throughout southern Central Asia by the 4th century BC.\nMiddle Eastern chicken remains go back to a little earlier than 2000\u00a0BC in Syria. Phoenicians spread chickens along the Mediterranean coasts as far as Iberia. During the Hellenistic period (4th\u20132nd centuries BC), in the southern Levant, chickens began to be widely domesticated for food. The first pictures of chickens in Europe are found on Corinthian pottery of the 7th century BC.\nBreeding increased under the Roman Empire and reduced in the Middle Ages. Genetic sequencing of chicken bones from archaeological sites in Europe revealed that in the High Middle Ages chickens became less aggressive and began to lay eggs earlier in the breeding season.\nDiseases.\nChickens are susceptible both to parasites such as mites, and to diseases caused by pathogens such as bacteria and viruses. The parasite \"Dermanyssus gallinae\" feeds on blood, causing irritation and reducing egg production, and acts as a vector for bacterial diseases such as salmonellosis and spirochaetosis.\nViral diseases include avian influenza.\nUse by humans.\nFarming.\nChickens are common and widespread domestic animals, with a total population of 23.7 billion as of 2018[ [update]]. More than 50 billion chickens are reared annually as a source of meat and eggs. In the United States alone, more than 8 billion chickens are slaughtered each year for meat, and more than 300 million chickens are reared for egg production. The vast majority of poultry is raised in factory farms. According to the Worldwatch Institute, 74% of the world's poultry meat and 68% of eggs are produced this way. An alternative to intensive poultry farming is free-range farming. Friction between these two main methods has led to long-term issues of ethical consumerism. Opponents of intensive farming argue that it harms the environment, creates human health risks and is inhumane towards sentient animals. Advocates of intensive farming say that their efficient systems save land and food resources owing to increased productivity, and that the animals are looked after in a controlled environment. Chickens farmed for meat are called broilers. Broiler breeds typically take less than six weeks to reach slaughter size, some weeks longer for free range and organic broilers.\nChickens farmed primarily for eggs are called layer hens. The UK alone consumes more than 34 million eggs per day. Hens of some breeds can produce over 300 eggs per year; the highest authenticated rate of egg laying is 371 eggs in 364 days. After 12 months of laying, the commercial hen's egg-laying ability declines to the point where the flock is commercially unviable. Hens, particularly from battery cage systems, are sometimes infirm or have lost a significant amount of their feathers, and their life expectancy has been reduced from around seven years to less than two years. In the UK and Europe, laying hens are then slaughtered and used in processed foods, or sold as 'soup hens'. In some other countries, flocks are sometimes force moulted rather than being slaughtered to re-invigorate egg-laying. This involves complete withdrawal of food (and sometimes water) for 7\u201314 days or sufficiently long to cause a body weight loss of 25 to 35%, or up to 28 days under experimental conditions. This stimulates the hen to lose her feathers but also re-invigorates egg-production. Some flocks may be force-moulted several times. In 2003, more than 75% of all flocks were moulted in the US. Chickens are one of the most efficient sources of foods for many different purposes.\nAs pets.\nKeeping chickens as pets became increasingly popular in the 2000s among urban and suburban residents. Many people obtain chickens for their egg production but often name them and treat them as any other pet like cats or dogs. Chickens provide companionship and have individual personalities. While many do not cuddle much, they will eat from one's hand, jump onto one's lap, respond to and follow their handlers, as well as show affection. Chickens are social, inquisitive, intelligent birds, and many people find their behaviour entertaining. Certain breeds, such as silkies and many bantam varieties, are generally docile and are often recommended as good pets around children with disabilities.\nCockfighting.\nA cockfight is a contest held in a ring called a cockpit between two cocks. Cockfighting is outlawed in many countries as involving cruelty to animals. The activity seems to have been practised in the Indus Valley civilisation from 2500 to 2100 BC. In the process of domestication, chickens were apparently kept initially for cockfighting, and only later used for food.\nIn science.\nChickens have long been used as model organisms to study developing embryos. Large numbers of embryos can be provided commercially; fertilized eggs can easily be opened and used to observe the developing embryo. Equally important, embryologists can carry out experiments on such embryos, close the egg again and study the effects later in development. For instance, many important discoveries in limb development have been made using chicken embryos, such as the discovery of the apical ectodermal ridge and the zone of polarizing activity.\nThe chicken was the first bird species to have its genome sequenced. At 1.21 Gb, the chicken genome is similarly sized compared to other birds, but smaller than nearly all mammals: the human genome is 3.2 Gb. The final gene set contained 26,640 genes (including noncoding genes and pseudogenes), with a total of 19,119 protein-coding genes, a similar number to the human genome. In 2006, scientists researching the ancestry of birds switched on a chicken recessive gene, \"talpid2\", and found that the embryo jaws initiated formation of teeth, like those found in ancient bird fossils.\nIn culture, folklore, and religion.\nChickens are featured widely in folklore, religion, literature, and popular culture. The chicken is a sacred animal in many cultures and deeply embedded in belief systems and religious practices.\nRoosters are sometimes used for divination, a practice called alectryomancy. This involves the sacrifice of a sacred rooster, often during a ritual cockfight, used as a form of communication with the gods. In Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez's Nobel-Prize-winning 1967 novel \"One Hundred Years of Solitude\", cockfighting is outlawed in the town of Macondo after the patriarch of the Buendia family murders his cockfighting rival and is haunted by the man's ghost. The pseudo-riddle \"Why did the chicken cross the road?\" dates to 1847, or earlier. Chickens have been featured in art in farmyard scenes such as Adriaen van Utrecht's 1646 \"Turkeys and Chickens\" and Walter Osborne's 1885 \"Feeding the Chickens\". The nursery rhyme \"Cock a doodle doo\", its chorus line imitating the cockerel's call, was published in \"Mother Goose's Melody\" in 1765.\nThe 2000 animated adventure comedy film \"Chicken Run\", directed by Peter Lord and Nick Park, featured anthropomorphic chickens with many chicken jokes.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
